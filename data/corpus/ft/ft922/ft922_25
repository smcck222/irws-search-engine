FT  13 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Worcester falls to Bosch as offer goes
unconditional
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY and NORMA COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ROBERT BOSCH, the German conglomerate, yesterday declared its Pounds 71.8m
offer for Worcester Group, the central heating boiler maker, unconditional.
It has acceptances or has acquired shares totalling 51 per cent of
Worcester's ordinary equity.
The offer, of 225p a share in cash or loan notes, will remain open until
further notice.
Worcester shares fell 2p to 219p yesterday, after the Takeover Panel ruled
on Monday against an appeal by a group of shareholders which had been
unhappy with the some of the terms of the offer.
These investors, with 27 per cent of the shares, were concerned about a deal
struck between Bosch and Worcester's management under which the management
would have a continuing equity interest in the business. They also felt the
price being offered was too low.
It emerged yesterday that the Takeover Panel was divided over its decision
to allow Bosch to proceed with its offer for Worcester. Following
presentations by both sides, several panel members privately expressed
concerns that the offer talks failed to take account of the interests of
non-management shareholders. Members of Worcester's management and their
families have 38.4 per cent of the group's shares.
There were also concerns about the message that approval of the bid would
send to other continental companies considering making a UK acquisition.
While the matter never proceeded to a formal vote, members were said to have
been persuaded by the argument that Bosch's offer contained considerable
equity risks for Worcester's management who will be shareholders in the
newly-formed Bosch subsidiary.
The dissenting investors have yet to decide whether to retain their shares
or accept the offer. They could continue as a minority in the hope of
obtaining a better price for their shares later.
However, the position of minority shareholders in such circumstances is not
often strong, and few have been successful in negotiating a higher offer.
They could find that the stock market quotation of the shares is lost,
making it difficult to trade in the shares, and that dividend payments are
small.
A minority with over 25 per cent of the shares could prevent Bosch from
passing special resolutions which might be necessary to restructure
Worcester's business, or merge it with Bosch's Junkers subsidiary.
But continental companies are accustomed to dealing with minority
shareholders. Bosch's readiness to declare the bid unconditional suggests
that it is not overly concerned by the threat.
If more than 90 per cent of investors accept the offer Bosch can apply to
the court for permission to buy the rest compulsorily.

FT  13 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Expanding network for GWR
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
GWR Group, the USM-quoted independent radio contractor, is to add Isle of
Wight Radio (Holdings) to its growing roster of local commercial radio
stations in the south of England, with a recommended Pounds 257,000 bid.
GWR is offering 10 new ordinary shares for every 56 IoW Radio shares. That
values each IoW Radio share at 50p, based on GWR shares at 288p, up 3p
yesterday.
IoW Radio has net assets of Pounds 205,800 and tax losses of Pounds 290,000.
In the year to October 31 it achieved turnover of Pounds 494,326, and Mr
Ralph Bernard, GWR chief executive, said it was 'close to break-even'.
IoW Radio's advertising will be wrapped up in, and will extend by 25 per
cent, 2CR's (Two Counties Radio) marketing area around Bournemouth. It is
estimated that it will contribute about Pounds 500,000 to GWR's turnover and
Pounds 100,000 to profit.

FT  13 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Union Intl gets closer to agreement on debt
standstill
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UNION International, the heavily indebted trading arm of the private Vestey
Group, is putting the finishing touches to a standstill agreement on Pounds
350m debt owed to some 70 banks.
Mr Paul Taylor, the former Lonrho executive who joined as Union's finance
director in March, said yesterday that the group was 'a long way down the
road' to completing the agreement.
The standstill, expected to be announced in July along with 1991 results and
a rationalisation programme, would run to December 1994.
The Vestey family - which controls the Vestey Group, one of the UK's largest
private companies - will provide an injection of more than Pounds 35m as
part of the agreement, Mr Taylor said, but no more. Union has had to give
the banks certain covenants, such as the disposal of assets. Several asset
sales were under way, Mr Taylor said.
The announcement last week that 600 of its 1,006 Dewhurst butchers shops
were to be sold formed part of the disposal programme. However, the
announcement had also in part been prompted by the fact that the 600 shops
were incurring losses.
He said Union had also discovered possible fraud - amounting to between
Pounds 1m and Pounds 2m - at one of its businesses.
Some of the money had been recovered and Union was considering legal action.

FT  13 MAY 92 / UK Company News: N America restrains overseas growth for
Marks and Spencer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN THORNHILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MARKS AND Spencer's international businesses recorded a mixed performance in
the year to March 31 with good growth from mainland Europe and south-east
Asia being offset by another weak performance from North America.
But the bulk of the group's business is still conducted in the UK where
sales suffered as a result of the recession, slipping by 0.6 per cent to
Pounds 4.92bn. Turnover from clothing and general sales fell 2.4 per cent to
Pounds 2.7bn with the food division rising 1.7 per cent to Pounds 2.22bn.
Operating profits rose from Pounds 603.1m to Pounds 638.7m.
The company provided further details of its retrenchment in Canada where it
was reducing its stores by 31 to 42 at an exceptional cost this time of
Pounds 30m.
Earlier this month, M and S announced it was in talks to dispose of its
Peoples Division. A Pounds 13.8m extraordinary provision was made on the
anticipated loss on the disposal, writing off a further Pounds 16m in
goodwill.
M and S had previously wrote off goodwill in its reserves. This year's
provision in its profit and loss account is to comply with new accounting
procedures. The company stressed this would have no additional impact on
cash flow or reserves.
The Brooks Brothers chain in the US and Japan, which has struggled in the
face of tough retail markets in North America, lifted profits from Dollars
11.1m to Dollars 18.2m (Pounds 10.2m).
Brooks spent Pounds 6m in capital expenditure and shut one store while
relocating two others. Another seven outlet stores will open by mid-year
although Brooks warned that its Japanese offshoots were beginning to detect
signs of a weakening economy.
The 17-store Kings Supermarkets chain in the US spent Pounds 7m in capital
expenditure but its sales and margins suffered from competitive discounting.
Sir Richard Greenbury, chairman and chief executive, said: 'Things are
beginning to improve but there will not be any quick fix in America. It will
take between three and five years.'
The emphasis on overseas expansion is increasingly being directed at
mainland Europe, where the number of stores increased by five to 17 with
Nantes, Toulouse, Liege, Amsterdam and Seville being added to the list.
Yesterday the company opened another store in The Hague in the Netherlands.
Mr Keith Oates, finance director, said the company was continuing to see
productivity improvements in both stores and head office. 'We have not only
increased our profits but also our profitability,' he said.
The company spent Pounds 305m in capital expenditure last year of which
Pounds 227m was in the UK and the Irish Republic. About Pounds 41m was
applied to upgrading computer systems helping to improve stockturn and drive
down inventory costs.
The number of full-time equivalent (FTE) staff in the UK and Irish Republic
fell from 38,970 to 35,850 as M and S flexed its cost base but productivity
per FTE grew strongly by 15 per cent to Pounds 17,800.
M and S added 535,000 sq ft of trading space during the period with four
edge-of-town stores, two town centre shops and five neighbourhood stores in
the UK.
The company had net borrowings of Pounds 261m at the year end representing
gearing of 9.7 per cent, down from 13.5 per cent a year before. Interest
income was Pounds 10.8m (Pounds 13.3m).
By region operating profits were UK and Irish Republic Pounds 638.7m (Pounds
603.1m); continental Europe (less opening costs) Pounds 23m (Pounds 20.4m);
US Pounds 14.5m (Pounds 10.3m); Canada Pounds 5.8m loss (Pounds 3.6m) and
Far East Pounds 5.4m (Pounds 3.3m).
The company's financial activities, including treasury, insurance and
financial services functions, contributed Pounds 23m (Pounds 20.1m) to
profits.

FT  13 MAY 92 / American recipe for European consumers: The likelihood of
Europe acquiring an increasing taste for US snack foods
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP RAWSTORNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The merger of PepsiCo's and General Mills's snack foods businesses in
continental Europe represents another investment in the belief that what the
US consumer did yesterday, the European consumer will do tomorrow.
In 1980, snacks accounted for about 18 per cent of the average American
diet. Today, it is more than 25 per cent. The trend has made PepsiCo's snack
foods more profitable than its better-known drinks brands. Operating profits
rose from Dollars 339m (Pounds 188m) in 1986 to Dollars 934m in 1990 before
restructuring costs reduced them to Dollars 788m last year.
Annual retail sales of two snack brands, Ruffles potato chips and Doritos
tortilla chips, have retail sales of more than Dollars 1bn each. The
successful growth of the business in the US convinced PepsiCo that the
process could be repeated worldwide.
Factors which drove the demand for snacks in the US have been evident for
some time in Europe. As the number of working women has increased, families
have been eating fewer meals together. The demand for convenience foods has
been stimulated and Europeans have discovered a taste for the chips and
crackers, candy and cookies, on which US consumers graze.
The experience of Pepsico's Frito-Lay, the leading US snacks manufacturer,
suggested that some potential barriers to growth in Europe would be less
inhibiting than some observers thought.
PepsiCo's successful introduction of western-style snacks in countries such
as Mexico and Korea encouraged its view that European eating habits would be
as susceptible to change.
Concerns about health and diet in the US as early as the mid-1970s led to
the company providing low-fat, low-salt snacks to make consumers feel better
as they indulged.
'The development of the industry has been remarkably consistent in spite of
widely varied cultures and tastes,' says Mr Michael Jordan, chairman of
PepsiCo international foods and beverages. 'Once the snacking habit is
established, consumers demand more variety. Product innovation then
generates further growth.'
PepsiCo introduced more than 40 new snacks into the US market during 1989
and 1990 - and the potential of the European venture's combined research and
development resources to improve on that record is clearly seen as a benefit
of the merger.
PepsiCo's international snacks operations now involve 27 businesses in 25
countries. It is the group's fastest-growing division. Sales have risen from
Dollars 419m to Dollars 1.8bn, and profits from Dollars 27.6m to Dollars
171m since 1987.
Europe, including the UK where PepsiCo secured a 39 per cent market share
with the Dollars 1.35bn acquisition of Smiths and Walkers crisps from BSN,
the French foods and drinks group, in 1989, accounts for 30 per cent of
sales.
Annual consumption of snack chips in the UK, the most highly developed
market, is still only 9lbs a head compared with 14lbs in the US. In Spain,
consumption per head is 3lbs, and in Turkey a mere two ounces.
Combined sales of the new venture amount to little more than 3 per cent of
the existing market - but the partners have now put themselves into a much
better position to increase that share.
General Mills brings to the venture secure shares in northern Europe. Its
three companies there - Biscuiterie Nantaise which has 4.4 per cent of the
Dollars 4bn French market, and the Smiths Food Group operations which hold
around 8 per cent of the Belgian and Dutch markets - have annual sales of
around Dollars 325m.
PepsiCo complements that with leadership in Spain, Portugal and Greece, the
fast-growing markets of southern Europe.
Europe may as well reconcile itself to the crunch of Cheetos and Doritos,
Bloopers and Chupa Chups.

FT  13 MAY 92 / Exporters worry over screwdriver economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LEADING EXPORTERS have warned ministers that the UK will become 'a
screwdriver- assembly economy' if the government's 'lamentable' attitude to
supporting exports is not reversed, the Labour party said yesterday.
A memorandum sent during the general election campaign and leaked to Labour
warns that, without corrective action, the UK's 'only real exports will be
British jobs'. Labour said the memo was backed by organisations, including
the British Exporters' Association. However, its claim that the document was
backed also by the Association of British Chambers of Commerce was denied by
the association last night.
The strong language highlights the private anxieties of many exporters,
particularly since the sale last year of the short-term insurance division
of the government's Export Credits Guarantee Department (ECGD).
It suggests there was an organised lobbying campaign during the election by
exporters to persuade Mr John Major to shake up the Department of Trade and
Industry and put pressure on the Treasury. The memorandum says the
organisations planned 'to convene a press conference in the near future to
expose the fallacy of the Treasury position'.
Yesterday the British Exporters' Association confirmed that it planned to
meet Mr Richard Needham, the new trade minister, on May 26 but refused to
comment on the leaked document. The DTI said the volume of UK exports was at
a record level but that Mr Needham was always ready to listen to industry's
view.
Mr Gordon Brown, Labour's trade and industry spokesman, said that during the
election exporters had met Mr (now Lord) John Wakeham, the former energy
secretary who helped run Conservative Central Office. The prime minister, he
said, had also been involved in discussions.
The memorandum says: 'The Treasury view is that any form of export support
is a subsidy and therefore ideologically unsound. The Treasury would rather
pay unemployment benefit than invest in employment through the promotion of
exports.'
The exporters go on to say that the ECGD sale, plus the introduction of a
Portfolio Management System which introduced stricter disciplines on the
cost of export cover, means 'most small companies do not export because of
lack of incentive or assistance'.
The memorandum concludes: 'On the government's own figures, the balance of
payments will continue to grow in both 1992 and 1993. Unless corrective
action is taken, the UK will become a screwdriver-assembly economy, and our
only real exports will be British jobs.'

FT  13 MAY 92 / The Lex Column: BAA
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The stock market is bound to worry that BAA's profits in the late 1990s will
get stuck in the sludge works occupying the future site of Heathrow's
Terminal 5. Investors, to be sure, have good reason to be cautious about the
airline industry's long-term prospects, given the unanimous belief of the
experts that everything looks rosy. But worries that BAA will be unable to
fund the terminal from new borrowings and retained earnings are probably
misplaced.
After adjusting for interest and inflation the ultimate cost of the project
could be Pounds 2bn, of which perhaps a little over half will be needed to
complete Phase One in 2002. That implies additional capital spending of
Pounds 100m a year, hardly excessive for a group which should be making
profits of Pounds 250m-Pounds 300m this year. Admittedly, BAA is heavily
cash negative at present due to existing capital commitments and low
profits. But by 1996-97, when the work is expected to start, this should
have reversed. The next pricing review is conveniently timed for around
then, which could give the company an opportunity to repeat the sort of
threats which helped it secure such a lenient regime last time.
That said, it is hard to see BAA providing much excitement following the
re-rating of the last six months. Relief at the outcome of the review, the
disappearance of the Labour threat and the stay of execution for intra-EC
duty-free have combined to leave the shares on a prospective yield of under
3 per cent and a forward multiple whose premium to the market is again
higher than the post-privatisation average.

FT  13 MAY 92 / The Lex Column: BP
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
BP's disposal of its remaining interests in Canada through a Canadian
securities house highlights how difficult it is to sell assets these days.
The proceeds will be paid in instalments over two years. But at least the
deal closes a frustrating chapter for BP. It also raises the larger question
of what the group might look like when its disposal programme is complete.
In broad terms, the balance of the business may not look that different,
with upstream oil accounting for roughly two thirds of capital employed and
the remaining third devoted to downstream oil and other odds and ends.
Exploration will concentrate on the biggest, most profitable fields at the
expense of riskier regions, where assets will eventually be sold.
The big question concerns the future of the unprofitable chemicals division,
which, at Pounds 3bn of annual turnover, is around the same size as the bulk
chemicals business of ICI. It is once more under the cost-cutter's knife. If
BP decides that its required rate of real growth is not achievable, it may
seek outside help by way of an off-balance sheet alliance or joint venture.
The attraction of that route is twofold. BP would share the formidable
burden of petrochemical investment. It would also flatter its creaking
balance sheet by shifting debt off the books. By going for scale, it might
also turn the screw on a few other oil companies which share the decades-old
delusion that chemicals provide a hedge against the oil industry cycle.

FT  13 MAY 92 / The Lex Column: Marks and Spencer
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
If the defensive qualities of Marks and Spencer were ever in question, its
full-year figures provide the final rebuttal. The 1 per cent rise in pre-tax
profits and earnings per share means it has got through yet another
recession - a particularly savage one for the retail trade - with its growth
record since the Korean War intact. Although Marks sees no upturn in demand,
its UK profits growth and margins were better in last year's second half
than in the first. In the current year, it says, the cost-cutting measures
already undertaken mean it can increase profits further on unchanged volume.
The one caveat is pricing. Marks is notably silent on the question of volume
versus prices last year, although the fact that its UK sales were down one
per cent on some 5 per cent extra space is telling enough. The issue is
particularly sensitive for Marks, whose reputation owes much to the notion
of fair value. In clothing, as elsewhere in the retail trade, discounting is
now so prevalent that shoppers may have some difficulty in deciding what
constitutes a fair offer.
But it does not do to quibble. At yesterday's 331p, Marks's shares are on a
historic multiple of 22 times, compared with a market average of 17. If the
prospect were one of a sharp bounce in retail spending, that would look
expensive by comparison with Marks's more bombed-out peers. But in the past
couple of weeks, the market's faith in a post-election retail boom has
weakened perceptibly. In uncertain times, there is much to be said for
quality.

FT  13 MAY 92 / The Lex Column: Inflation in the works
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It is tempting to see the sharp drop in April producer price inflation as
justification for last week's base rate cut. But that is altogether too
neat. The fall in the headline rate - to 3.8 per cent from 4.5 in March -
largely reflected slackening pressures on food, drink and tobacco prices,
probably because manufacturers are reluctant to pass on Budget increases.
The underlying rate of 2.8 per cent, although low, has barely moved over the
past three months.
Three factors should continue to restrain wholesale price inflation in the
short run: weak raw material prices, a relatively strong currency and
downward pressure on wages resulting from both fear of unemployment and
tight corporate cash flow. Less clear is how far the recent record can be
sustained in the upturn. Unless it can, the UK has little chance of
undercutting German interest rates for any length of time. But manufacturers
may well be anxious to use any recovery of demand to repair margins,
especially in sectors such as metals and fibres, where prices have actually
fallen over the past year.
Nor is there a direct correlation between producer prices and retail
inflation. Admittedly, the worst forecasts may prove exaggerated when
April's RPI is announced on Friday. Food, drink and tobacco prices may also
be sluggish at the retail level, but the rate will jump from March's 4 per
cent as lower mortgage interest rates fall away. And while manufacturers'
prices are soft, the service sector has been much slower to respond to
treatment.

FT  13 MAY 92 / Fifth Heathrow terminal plan: BAA move to beat congestion at
airport welcomed by airline industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS, Aerospace Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BAA, the former British Airports Authority, yesterday unveiled its
long-awaited plans to build a Pounds 800m-Pounds 900m fifth terminal at
Heathrow, which handles more international passengers than any other airport
in the world.
The scheme, expected to lead to a lengthy planning inquiry, was attacked by
local residents but welcomed by the airline industry.
Sir John Egan, BAA's chief executive, said the terminal would help Heathrow
maintain its leading international position 'well into the next century' and
safeguard 10,000 jobs there.
It would also provide extra capacity for 30m passengers a year at Heathrow,
one of the world's most congested airports, and a new base for British
Airways, the UK flag carrier which accounts for 40 per cent of Heathrow's
airline traffic.
BAA had originally estimated the cost of building the terminal at Pounds
1.6bn, but Sir John said the estimate had been reduced to Pounds 800m-Pounds
900m because of improved pre-planning and better project management.
The project would be financed from cash flow and some debt, although the
borrowings would not affect the company's current gearing levels, Sir John
said.
Detailed architectural designs have yet to be completed by the Richard
Rogers Partnership. Bovis, the construction arm of the P&amp;O company, is also
working on the project. BAA is hoping to win government approval in 1997
after a public inquiry.
The proposals envisage building the terminal at the west end of the airport
on the site now occupied by the Perry Oaks sludge works. Agreement has been
reached with Thames Water to move the sludge works to the nearby site of an
existing sewage works at Iver South.
The terminal is to be built in two phases. The first would cost about Pounds
500m and be completed in 2002. It would provide capacity for 10m passengers
a year and parking space for 20 aircraft.
The second phase, to be comoverall capacity to 30m passengers a year and
provide parking space for 60 aircraft, including the new generation of very
large widebody airliners.
The terminal will be connected to three satellites linked by underground
'people movers'. Road links and a direct express rail line to central London
are also planned.
Sir John said the project would help Heathrow cope with the increasing
demand for air travel in south-east England. BAA is forecasting a doubling
of annual passenger movements in the London area to 120m passengers by 2002
and a trebling of demand to 170m passengers by 2016.
After the slump in airline traffic caused by the Gulf war and the recession
last year, activity has been steadily improving at BAA's airports.
The company said that last month was its busiest April ever, with BAA
airports handling 6.2m passengers, a 20 per cent increase on April last year
and a 3.6 per cent increase on April 1990.
BAA and the airline industry have long argued for extra capacity at Heathrow
to maintain London's position as the world's leading international passenger
airline hub.
The International Air Transport Association said that, without the new
terminal and other air traffic control and infrastructure investments,
Britain stood to lose Dollars 1bn annually of economic activity by 2000.
But local residents and authorities reacted strongly to the plans, fearing
these would cause even greater noise, traffic congestion and other
disturbances.
In an effort to allay these fears, Sir John said the terminal project did
not involve the construction of a new runway at Heathrow nor extra night
flights because new larger and quieter widebody aircraft would help
transport many more passengers on a single flight.

FT  13 MAY 92 / Letter: Auditors' image moves misdirected
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr PHILIP K WOOD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I am dismayed at the misdirected attempts of the auditing profession to
reform its image (Letters, May 7). For example, the proposal for interim
accounts to be audited is clearly self-serving and will add to audit costs.
The profession is trying to widen the scope of its involvement at the same
time as avoiding taking responsibility for the traditional audit.
A reversal of the 'Caparo' decision is long overdue. There is no point in
widening the scope of the auditors' remit if investors cannot rely upon the
existing annual audit opinion.

FT  13 MAY 92 / Letter: Legislation for pension security
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr MAURICE REDMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your timely leader (May 11) outlining improvements needed to pensions
schemes seems unexceptional apart from the suggested shift towards money
purchase schemes. If these depend on the gamble on market performance and
annuity rates at retirement day, they do not achieve the essential
ingredient of a pension scheme - predictable and therefore reliable
pensions.
Now is the time not only to legislate for fund security but also to remedy
the shortfalls of the Fowler legacy, which is not achieving the
quintessential tenets.
One is that we should all pay for our pensions as we journey through our
working life. (But the abolition of compulsory membership of occupational
schemes is now coupled with only voluntary personal pensions and is
consequently resulting in an unacceptable proportion of people making no
pension provision at all, so these will become an ultimate burden on the
state).
Another is 100 per cent fully-transferable service between occupational
schemes, ensuring maximum flexibility for the benefit of the economy and for
individual career prospects.
The only financial beneficiaries of down-rated transfer values are the
former or the new employers or both; a person changing his job should not be
robbed in this manner when he has paid for his pension in good faith. The
defensive but tortuous actuarial arguments (which adhere only to company
considerations) ignore the essential national need that pensions need to be
reliable. Personal pensions gain portability only by sacrificing
reliability.
What is needed is complete interchangeability between occupational pension
schemes such as exists within the 'Club' in the public sector. Already many
large company schemes match the Club in quality though not
interchangeability. The Club scheme should become a model and perhaps even
compulsory.
It must surely be a sine qua non that if a company is to underwrite any
actuarial deficiency then it is entitled to any actuarial surplus but only
as a contribution holiday and not to repayment, because a deficiency might
recur.

FT  13 MAY 92 / Letter: Cost pressures that will change the shape of the oil
industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Ms CHRISTINE BAKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I read with interest the Lex column regarding the oil industry (May 11)
where the real problem was diagnosed as 'not so much cheap oil as the
financial legacy of the late 1980s'. This tells part, but by no means all,
of the story.
Companies are facing a declining net margin not just because of the restored
downward trend in real oil values - which looks set to continue in the 1990s
 -but because of rising real costs. These are an equally important part of
the profit equation, yet strangely ignored.
The industry is facing cost pressures on all sides; upstream, as exploration
activity increasingly focuses on frontier, or relatively unexplored, areas;
downstream, as product specification standards are tightened to deal with
environmental issues.
In the US alone, it is estimated that the cost of clean air legislation will
amount to some Dollars 40bn between now and 2000.
The leading companies will meanwhile continue paying the price of a largely
unsuccessful and expensive diversification programme away from oil and gas
in the 1980s through an ongoing process of restructuring.
For the independents spawned during the boom years, horizontal integration
may be the next big step forward in the process of their evolution.
The industry's power base, having variously shifted between the owners and
developers of the assets over the past 30 years, now seems to be moving
towards the consumers. The industry as a whole will survive the trend,
though perhaps not in its current form.

Sir, l would like to clarify one area raised by Raymond Snoddy in his
comprehensive feature (Management: Marketing and Advertising, 'Turning to
television for the power and the glory', May 7) about the broadcasting of
company annual general meetings on BBC Select.
While the BBC believes that improving shareholder access to company
information is perfectly in keeping with its public service remit, it is
also important to ensure that the service does not allow advertising by the
back door. So any mention of products on the new service must be clearly
within the context of the meeting, and must not be promotional in tone.
The use of BBC airtime to cover events such as product launches will not be

FT  13 MAY 92 / Letter: Plea is a sign of growing competition
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr DAVID PORTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I had just finished telling a New York conference that competition was
developing in the UK electricity industry, when I read your report about
National Power's plea to the new energy minister, Mr Tim Eggar ('Power chief
sees threat to coal sell-off', May 5).
If Mr Eggar wants the two major generators to buy more coal from British
Coal than they seem inclined to, he should avoid offering any bribe which
might damage emerging competition in generation.
Much of that competition will come from clean, efficient gas-fired power
stations and it is ironic that National Power's chief executive should be
asking the regulator (Offer) to question the economics of its competitors'
gas fired projects. What he did not say is that National Power is building
several such stations and that these will also displace coal-burning plant.
Perhaps National Power's special pleading is a sign that the business is
becoming more competitive.

FT  13 MAY 92 / Leading Article: France's road to Euro-union
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MR MICHEL VAUZELLE, the French justice minister, was right to tell the
National Assembly recently that, in ratifying the Maastricht treaty, France
will not irrevocably be giving up sovereignty. It will simply be
transferring 'competence' to supranational EC institutions such as a
European central bank. Mr Pierre Beregovoy, the prime minister, meanwhile
has reminded his compatriots that the Maastricht path represents a way in
which France, far from losing independence, can regain a degree of control
over monetary affairs at present largely ceded to the Bundesbank.
Despite these weighty statements of reassurance, the French classe politique
is churning an extremely ragged furrow as it ploughs through the task of
approving the European union treaty. A 'yes' vote in the National Assembly
to the constitutional change has never seriously been in doubt. But the
Gaullists in the right-wing opposition have shown far more hostility than
expected to plans for a common visa policy and national voting rights for
non-French citizens, as well as to the single EC currency. Even in France's
loamy soil there exists a vein of Euro-scepticism which many had presumed
existed only in the clay of Britain. Though the French debate on Europe is
arguably overdue, it is healthy that these doubts should be fully aired
before the treaty passes to the statute books. The intensity of the debate
has underlined that the French parliament must be consulted far more closely
in later stages of the Maastricht process.
Soul-searching
Even after yesterday's final exchanges in the National Assembly, the French
ratification carousel will continue to turn. The constitutional amendment
has to pass before the Senate, and then to a congress of both houses of
parliament at Versailles. A national referendum on the treaty may still be
necessary later this summer.
Maastricht soul-searching is not confined to France. The different points
along the route towards European integration, particularly the 'convergence'
road towards economic and monetary union, will bring considerable stress for
national democracies and institutions. Although the journey is worth
undertaking, the strains must not be underestimated.
Each country presents its doubts in a slightly different way. A majority of
Danish voters is presently telling opinion pollsters that they will vote
against the treaty in the country's referendum on Maastricht on June 2.
Germany frets over whether the mooted new currency should be called the Ecu
or the Euro-Mark.
Queen's speech
Britain's particular Angst centres on whether the Queen, in a speech in
Strasbourg, was allowed excessive latitude to make light of differences in
national parliamentary traditions. The semantic formulae eventually agreed
for the monarch's address yesterday, in which she hailed the 'diverse
personalities' of the 'European family', however represented a successful
compromise; phrases suggestive of Europe des patries these days are likely
to win approval in Bonn, not just Westminister.
Much national wrangling over Maastricht may prove to be heavily exaggerated.
While the Germans are worrying that they will lose national monetary
control, right-wing commentators in Paris are complaining that Maastricht
will bring France under the heel of the D-Mark. This is an amusing but
absurd contradiction. Ironically, the French ratification discussions are
coming to a head when Germany's difficulties give its partners more leeway
to cut interest rates than they earlier had. The more perceptive members of
the French Gaullist party realise that, even if the treaty is ratified by
all, the move to Emu cannot yet be considered irreversible. National
parliaments will inevitably have the final say before exchange rates are
irrevocably fixed.
Through its success in strengthening the franc by bringing inflation below
the German rate, France has invested more political and economic capital in
the project of European union than any other EC member. The pain suffered
while securing that achievement explains why the French debate on Maastricht
has been so grudging; it also explains, however, why France, of all EC
members, can least afford to allow the Maastricht process to fail.

FT  13 MAY 92 / Arts: Drama strong on flashback - Television
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER DUNKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is remarkable how often television dramas come along in pairs: two set in
India, two about ancient history, two with eccentric policemen as their main
characters. Last night's Anglo-Saxon Attitudes on ITV was the second within
three days to begin its opening episode with the digging up of a skull, to
feature Douglas Hodge (who played Declan in Capital City) in one of the main
roles, and to use flashback not merely as a routine technique but as a
primary structural element. The other was A Fatal Inversion which began on
BBC1 on Sunday.
If you watched Anglo-Saxon Attitudes last night you will presumably need
little urging to watch the other two parts. If you missed it, find someone
with a cassette and bribe them if necessary to lend it so that you can catch
up before next week's episode. This is one of those rare television
productions in which everything works well: writing, acting, direction,
locations, even the period detail which, refreshingly, is not rammed under
our noses.
I cannot be so sure in the case of A Fatal Inversion, having seen only the
first of the three episodes, but this, being a mystery story written by Ruth
Rendell under her 'Barbara Vine' pseudonym, is if anything even more
compelling in its narrative tension. Having seen the hares that were set
running in the opening episode it would be unthinkable to miss the other
two. Whether you consider it fortunate to have two such excellent serials
appearing simultaneously, or irritating not to have them better spaced out,
presumably depends upon your attitude: do you see a glass as half full or
half empty?
Since A Fatal Inversion is a thriller it is unlikely that there will be much
talk about whether Sandy Welch's adaptation takes liberties with the
original but, given Angus Wilson's reputation and especially the increase in
regard since his death, we can expect those who would like to be thought
'literary' to start squawking as usual about lack of faithfulness in Andrew
Davies' adaptation of Anglo-Saxon Attitudes. It is nonsense of course.
Does anyone care that Laurents changed the Montagues and Capulets into Jets
and Sharks for West Side Story? If so, what do they say about the liberties
Shakespeare took when he pinched the story from Brooke's Tragicall Historye
Of Romeus And Juliet? Or the way that Brooke played fast and loose in
adapting from Boaistuau? Or Boaistuau's casualness when he lifted the story
from Bandello's 'Novelle'?
What we have in Anglo-Saxon Attitudes, regardless of its literary
antecedents, is splendid television, full of solidly three dimensional
characters, inhabiting a wholly believable world, with social, political,
sexual and historical comment whizzing off like sparks from a catherine
wheel. Set in the 1950s, but with its plot originating in an archaeological
dig in 1912, it is essentially a comedy of manners largely concerned with
the idiosyncracies and hypocrisies of the English middle classes.
Davies, now established as one of the best writers for the medium, either of
his own work (A Very Peculiar Practice) or of adaptations from others (most
recently Amis's Old Devils) has, of course, used techniques which rarely
succeed on the printed page. As any true master of television (for example
Dennis Potter) knows, you can move through time and space more easily in
this medium than in print.
Davies toggles effortlessly between 1912 and 1950 and, having established
Gerald Middleton as both a young man (Hodge) and older man (Richard Johnson
with a quiet and controlled but utterly telling performance), he
occasionally inserts the older version of Middleton into the flashbacks when
we are, naturally, expecting the younger. The effect is a peculiarly
powerful conflation of youth and age into a single life.
Because this serial tells the story of two generations of an English middle
class family with one important in-comer from Europe, repeatedly uses
flashback, and contains some explicit sex, it is difficult to avoid
comparisons with The Camomile Lawn, but Anglo-Saxon Attitudes surely comes
out well ahead. In The Camomile Lawn incident followed incident as one link
in a chain follows another; the sex scenes, for instance, were quite fun but
only loosely connected to other events and scarcely central to the plot.
But in Anglo-Saxon Attitudes it is vital that we appreciate the sexual
passion between the young Gerald and Dollie if we are to understand the
subsequent void at the centre of Gerald's life and the failure of his
relationship with wife and family. In this drama the development of plot and
character is more like the construction of a building, with the ground floor
depending on the foundations, the first floor on the ground floor, and so
on.
It is honest, comic, enlightening and entertaining, so self righteous
lectures about television failing to stick to every last detail in the book
should be seen for what they are: yet another example of the widespread
desire to appear superior to television. No doubt there will be fewer
squeaks of concern over A Fatal Inversion because less is expected of a
thriller and there are fewer brownie points to be gained from an officious
defence of the book.
Yet the opening episode suggests that we have here a very superior thriller
indeed. This time the flashbacks are across only 12 years, and the evidence
suggests that Hodge will be giving his best television performance to date
as the young father and successful professional looking back to a teenage
summer that began idyllically in the big country house which he inherited
that year.
In the opening episode director Tim Fywell captured that quality of youth
which sometimes seems like innocence, sometimes like idiocy, sometimes like
mere inexperience: it is manifest in the unspoken assumption that life is
endless and that there is consequently infinite time to laze, argue, or make
love. It is a characteristic which few of us are lucky enough to sustain
beyond the age of about 20 and it is not the sort of thing which is easy to
convey in a television drama, yet here it seeped out of every frame. The
tension arose from the stark contrast between that idyll and the suspicions
aroused by the discovery of the human remains in the grounds of the country
house. What on earth happened that summer, and whodunnit? It would take a
very cold fish not to tune in next week.
Saturday brought the opening episodes of two new four-part drama series, The
Nightmare Years on Channel 4 and Frankie's House on ITV. Each is about a
young man newly arrived in a foreign country dominated by its military
forces, in each case the man works for a news agency, in each case, as we
know from history, a major war is in the offing, and both stories are about
real people. In The Nightmare Years American William Shirer has just arrived
in Berlin in 1934, and in Frankie's House Englishman Tim Page has just
arrived in Saigon in 1964.

FT  13 MAY 92 / Arts: A Slip of the Tongue/Leave Taking - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD and ANDREW ST GEORGE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The programme for A Slip of the Tongue contains another of those
chronologies of events in eastern Europe from the late 1980s onwards with
which London theatre-goers must by now be familiar. There is a very odd
entry, however, for December 1989. It reads simply: 'Romania - Vaclav Havel
elected President'.
Yet perhaps that is a deliberate slip of the pen. Dusty Hughes's play is
based on a character from Czechoslovakia, where Vaclav Havel was indeed
elected President, but the background is more Romanian and at times a
socialist Ruritania seems not out of place.
Dominik Tatarka, the hero (of sorts), was a Slovak writer who was repeatedly
imprisoned or internally exiled by the regime. As such, he had something in
common with Havel. Yet there the similarity ends. In the play, Tatarka
becomes Dominic Tantra. According to the script, he was constantly visited
in his enforced rural retreat by a stream of women students, all of them
claiming to admire his work. All of them bring him a Buddha as a mark of
respect - by the start of the second act, there are at least six buddha
figures in his cupboard.
The women are also informers, sent by the regime. Tantra deals with them
easily enough by seducing them. It is when one of them tells him that the
Berlin Wall has come down that his confidence ebbs and he claims to have
become impotent. Thereafter it is the women who have to make the first move
in the seduction process. He does not wish to become president of the new
democracy and prefers to hop off to the Frankfurt book fair. To his credit
he does not want an inquest into the past. The real Tatarka died in 1989.
The chief interest in this production is that it is by the Steppenwolf
Theatre Company of Chicago with John Malkovich, one of its founding members,
playing Tantra. It bothers me slightly that on the evidence of this piece I
cannot see why the company is so widely admired. Malkovich gives a perfectly
pleasant performance and has an attractively modulated voice. The women
admirers are adequate, but there is not much to distinguish between them. In
short, there are no fireworks.
Perhaps the weakness lies in the text. One is a little weary by now of
hearing how eastern Europe admired America for its jazz and Coca Cola and
even the joke of Tantra pausing while undressing one of the women to admire
the Japanese zip on her skirt is not entirely new. A Slip of the Tongue
hovers on farce, but it is never clear to which genre it is intended to
belong. I suspect that both the play and the Steppenwolf Company would be
much better on a smaller stage.
                       *       *      *
Winsome Pinnock's Leave Taking, which won the 1991 George Devine Award, is a
play about the tension between Caribbean and black British lifestyle. This
has become an established tradition in British culture, with Jean Rhys's Let
Them Call it Jazz first among many. Leave Taking mines a rich dramatic vein:
generations of black British at variance in one family.
Enid left Jamaica as a young woman, and brought up her daughters, Del and
Viv, in England. Both daughters have integrated, one by taking on the
trappings of mainstream British culture, the other by succeeding at school.
But when Enid visits an Obeah-woman for haruspic guidance, she realises she
has repressed her roots in order to fit in. A family friend, 'uncle Brod',
the unassimilated voice of Jamaica, reinforces her memories of home.
The new generation has a wider choice. While Enid lists the sacrifices she
made for her children, her daughter taunts: 'I'm gonna have ev'thing you
wanted but were too frightened to enjoy.' The play ends with a fragile
compromise as new black British reaches out to the old Jamaican.
The wonderful design (Trudy Marklew) conveys urban clutter and Caribbean
space, giving visual reality to the forces which shape the characters. Large
window frames with billowing curtains form an angle in which a living-room
set is crammed. The acting maintains a high energy, and the action should
gather momentum throughout the play's run.
Leave Taking presents the first all-black cast on stage at the Belgrade main
house. This is surprising in a theatre with a Black Arts Events office, but
understandable in a city committed to multicultural theatre, although black
culture itself embraces great diversity. Leave Taking figures in a series
Black culture and arts events: Martin Luther King was commemorated on April
24; Bob Marley is celebrated in an exhibition at the Polytechnic next month.

FT  13 MAY 92 / Arts: Tennstedt's Debussy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAX LOPPERT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Klaus Tennstedt, a conductor of naked artistic integrity and emotional
intensity, is that rare beast, the genuinely inspired interpreter of the
great Austro-German symphonic masterpieces. His Royal Festival Hall ventures
into other repertories and musical languages have been scarcer, and less
imbued with the fiery authority that marks, say, his Beethoven, Bruckner or
Mahler with the London Philharmonic. I recall, for instance, a heartfelt LPO
Verdi Requiem that sounded - felt - entirely unidiomatic; and on Sunday at
the Festival Hall, the same could be said of his encounters with Debussy.
The LPO gave us the Three Nocturnes in the first half and L'Apres-midi d'un
faune in the second (followed by a Stravinsky Firebird Suite brash but full
of life). The lack of Debussyan detachment and distance was comprehensive.
The phrases of 'Nuages' were lustrous but deprived of internal ventilation;
'Fetes', with an unhappy slowing of its central procession, was noisy,
lurchingly imprecise; and 'Sirenes', with an uncomfortably spotlit and often
ill-tuned contingent of LPO Choir sopranos, meandered. Tennstedt seemed
unable to gain imaginative entrance into the Debussy sound-world; in
L'Apres-midi, linear distinctness was continually sacrificed to an alien
languorous warmth.
Because these were rawly honest performances, 'personal' and unvarnished,
searchingly undertaken and unstintingly delivered, their very
wrong-headedness proved fascinating. It was altogether a peculiar concert.
As the latest in the orchestra's current series of loose tributes to
Diaghilev, it began with Shura Cherkassky playing Schumann's Carnaval: after
a rocky start, he made the piano speak and sing with so much
echt-Cherkasskian feline wit, idiosyncratic delicacy and impish brilliance
that it felt a cruel deprivation not to be spending the rest of the evening
in his company.
                      *      *      *
In the same hall the following evening, the BBC Symphony Orchestra under
Andrew Davis gave excellent support to a Schumann pianist of a very
different kind. This was Imogen Cooper, whose account of the Piano Concerto
was wonderfully full of gentle, inward-turned imaginative perceptions. Miss
Cooper caught the 'domestic' side of the invention with unfailing aptness,
penetrated its poetic nooks and crannies with quiet eloquence. I have not
heard this pianist for a few years; in that time she appears to have
blossomed as an artist.
Earlier, Davis and his orchestra had poured their plentiful supplies of
energy and enthusiasm into the first performance of Philip Grange's Focus
and Fade. This 20-minute orchestral fantasy in three linked movements
displays an easy command of large forces, evident care in the linking and
cross-referencing of ideas, and a disheartening shortage of identifying,
clinching personality. Grange, who came to prominence at the start of the
1980s with a number of striking compositions for small forces, seemed here
the retailer of just another anonymous 'modern orchestral showpiece'.

Although there has recently been considerable rainfall (in London, anyway)
the long term outlook for water supplies in south-east England seems pretty
dismal. Channel 4's often excellent documentary series Dispatches goes
underground to inspect the damage to reserves and discovers falling water
tables, polluted bore holes and dried up wells. The programme suggests that
the privatised water companies do not see conservation as part of their
role.
BBC2 continues the repeat of its outstanding 1985 drama serial Edge Of
Darkness which, in the words of its producer Michael Wearing, is 'a thriller
set in the world of political power' with 'reminders of the John Buchan
tradition' in which a man finds himself 'alone against an unfathomable
system': the essence of so many memorable works of fiction (9.25).
BBC1's documentary series Inside Story returns (9.30) with a programme
called 'Why Women Kill'. Women in American prisons explain how they were
'pushed beyond the limits of endurance' and 'ended the lives of their
abusers' ..or murdered them, as the politically incorrect would say.

   I would hardly take space to review a Messiah
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
even a Messiah of superior quality - had not this one, among many other
points of interest, brought forward a remarkable mezzo, with the most
alluring new voice I've heard this season. She is Denyce Graves,
Washington-born, 28 years old, a graduate of the Houston Opera Studio. I had
heard of her - she has sung a clutch of Carmens in America and Europe - but
I didn't know she was so good. My colleague Joseph McClellan, the critic of
the Washington Post, who had heard her in Washington as Maddalena and in
Elgar's The Light of Life, told me that every time he hears her she has
taken a great leap forward.
Washington celebrated the 250th anniversary of Messiah with a reconstruction
of the original, 1742 Dublin text. Miss Graves played Mrs Cibber, the tragic
(but also comic) actress entrusted with 'He shall feed his flock' (the whole
of it, not shared with the soprano, as it was shared at Covent Garden the
following year, between Mrs Cibber and Kitty Clive, a Lucy and a Polly from
The Beggar's Opera), 'He was despised,' and 'If God is for us'. When Mrs
Cibber died, Garrick said, 'tragedy died with her.' She was not a virtuoso
vocalist, but, Burney said, 'by perfect conception of the words, she often
penetrated the heart when others, with infinitely greater skill, could only
reach the ear.'
In a splash of luxury casting, America's two leading countertenors, Drew
Minter and Jeffrey Gall, played William Lamb and Joseph Ward, the
countertenors Handel found in the Dublin cathedral choirs, the first
assigned an aria ('O thou that tellest'), the other a duet with the tenor,
and the two of them briefly entwined in a duet setting of 'How beautiful are
the feet'. Curious to see them sitting by - appraising, admiring - during
Mrs Cibber's songs, which both of them, in other versions of Messiah, have
so often sung with distinction.
Handel had seven soloists in Dublin. In Washington, Benita Valente was his
soprano (Signora Avoglio), Curtis Rayam was his tenor (John Bayley) and
David Arnold doubled as the two basses (John Hill and John Mason). They were
all on peak form, singing lightly and clearly, purely tuned, singing on the
words, without pushing. The Smithsonian Concerto Grosso (in this Dublin
version just strings, with trumpets and drums in a few numbers) played well.
The conductor was Paul Traver, and the choir was his University of Maryland
Chorus, which has been the glory, year after year, of the Maryland Handel
Festival - fluent, athletic, purely tuned, verbally acute. (The recession
and the starving of funds to education last year broke off the festival's
progress through the oratorios; but it seems that it may resume in October
with Hercules.) Traver is a Handel conductor who can combine lightness and
grace with earnestness and majesty. This Messiah moved surely.
And the 'Dublin version' moves surely, too. As a generalisation, the first
version of any Handel work is greater than the revivals where he adjusted
the music to accommodate a new cast. The Maryland oratorio performances use
first version as base text. Messiah is perhaps an exception; the 4/4
'Rejoice', for example, is surely an improvement on Dublin's 12/8 version.
But the sequence of soloists in the Dublin Messiah - the delaying of the
soprano's and of Mrs Cibber's 'entrance arias' - is excellently dramatic.
Denyce Graves, in Mrs Cibber's songs, displayed a voice suggesting that, to
put it simply, America has acquired a new Kathleen Ferrier, a singer whose
tones run from the depths to the peaks - unforced, unpushed - in tones that
are beautiful and moving, and one who communicates the sense of the words
that she sings. A biographical note in the programme, however, predicted a
dull immediate future: merely conventional, commercial star appearances as
Carmen and as Delilah here, there, and everywhere. She is a more important
singer than that. I look forward to hearing her as the Angel in Gerontius,
in the Matthew Passion, as Gluck's Orpheus, and in the new works that our
living composers, once they have heard her, will surely be inspired to write
for her.
This Messiah was a part of Kennedy Center's Tribute to Germany, supported by
the German government and sponsored by Robert Bosch, Daimler-Benz, the
Deutsche Bank, Lufthansa, Mannesmann, Miles (a Pittsburgh subsidiary of
Bayer), Siemens, and Thyssen, along with 'a generous grant' from Du Pont and
'gifts' from various American companies, foundations, and individuals.
Handel was born in Germany; the Stuttgart Ballet (Marcia Haydee made her
American farewell the day before this Messiah) was another part of the
tribute. The patterns of patronage have changed since Handel's day. Jim
Wolfensohn, the chairman of Kennedy Center, has evidently mastered them.

FT  13 MAY 92 / FT Law Report: Land to be sold at market price
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RACHEL DAVIES, Barrister

<TEXT>
FREEDMAN &amp; OTHERS v BRITISH RAILWAYS BOARD AND ANOTHER CHURCH COMMISSIONERS
FOR ENGLAND v BRITISH RAILWAYS BOARD AND ANOTHER Court of Appeal: (Lord
Justice Nourse, Lord Justice Taylor, Lord Justice Stuart-Smith): April 9
1992.
BRITISH RAIL may sell superfluous lands at market value back to the
successors of the vendors from whom it was compulsorily purchased, in that
the statutory provisions giving the vendors a right of pre-emption at the
original purchase price have been repealed.
The Court of Appeal so held when allowing an appeal by the defendants,
British Railways Board and National Carriers Ltd, from Mr Justice Hoffmann's
decision (FT, March 30 1990) in two actions, that they must sell derelict
land back to the Special Trustees for Saint Bartholemew's Hospital and the
Church Commissioners for England as the successors of those from whom they
acquired it, for the original price.
LORD JUSTICE NOURSE said that 125 acres of derelict land north of King's
Cross Station were to form the terminus of the Channel Tunnel rail link and
a large commercial development. They were compulsorily acquired pursuant to
the Great Northern Railway Act 1846, which empowered the company of that
name to build the railway between London and York.
The land had since passed into ownership of the British Railways Board and
National Carriers Ltd.
Mr Justice Hoffmann on preliminary issues in two actions held that sections
57 and 102 of the 1846 Act (which he held had not been repealed) enabled the
Special Trustees and the Church Commissioners, as successors of those from
whom parts of the land were compulsorily acquired, to buy back three areas
amounting to 52 acres ('the yellow land', 'the red land' and 'the green
land') for the prices at which they were originally acquired.
There was a fourth area of eight acres ('the blue land'), which was acquired
by agreement. The judge held there was no right to buy back the blue land.
The yellow, the red and the blue land was acquired from predecessors of the
Special Trustees, and the green land from predecessors of the Church
Commissioners.
The whole of the yellow, most of the red, parts of the green and the whole
of the blue land was owned by British Rail. The remainder of the red and the
green land was owned by National Carriers.
British Rail and National Carriers appealed against Mr Justice Hoffmann's
decision on the yellow, red and green land. They contended that sections 57
and 102 did not have the effect he had attributed to them, or alternatively
that they had been repealed. The Special Trustees cross-appealed against his
decision on the blue land.
A 'code' of provisions dealing with superfluous land in sections 127 to 132
of the Land Clauses Consolidation Act 1845 was incorporated into the 1846
Act.
Section 127 provided that the company should sell all superfluous lands
within 10 years after expiration of the statutory period for completion of
the works. By section 128, it first had to offer them to the person entitled
to the lands 'from which the same were originally severed'.
Section 57 of the 1846 Act, which applied to the yellow and the red land
acquired from the hospital, provided that if 'at any time or times' after
completion of the railway any of the land was not used and required for the
purposes for which the company was incorporated, 'the company shall offer
such land to the governors at a sum not exceeding the original price'.
British Rail and National Carriers argued that 'at any time or times' in
section 57 must, by virtue of sections 127 and 128 of the code, be read as
meaning 'at any time or times within 10 years after the expiration of the
time limited for completion of the works'. They said section 57 was merely a
gloss on the code which varied it in certain respects.
Section 57 could be free from the time limit and still be a gloss on the
code.
It was impossible to say that the time limit was incorporated. In the
context of the section as a whole it would be repugnant to common sense to
say that 'at any time or times' meant 'at any time or times within 10 years
after the expiration of the time limited by this Act for the completion of
the works'.
Mr Justice Hoffmann's conclusion on section 57 was correct. The section
applied without any time limit to the yellow and the red land. Unless
repealed by subsequent legislation, the hospital's right of pre-emption
still existed. The same applied to section 102.
As to the blue land, the power to acquire it arose under section 45 of the
Railway Clauses Consolidation Act, which authorised the acquisition of
additional land by agreement.
The blue land was conveyed to the hospital on January 17 1851. The
conveyance provided that if at any time after three years from that date any
part of the land 'shall not be used and required' for formation and
completion of the railway, the company should give the hospital the right of
pre-emption at the original price.
The hospital contended that that provision gave it a right equivalent to
that given by section 102.
The judge rightly rejected that contention on the ground that once the land
had been 'used and required' the event which gave rise to the right could
never occur.
The remaining question was whether sections 57 and 102 had been repealed.
Section 43 of the London and North Eastern Railway Act 1923 provided that
the company should not be required to sell and dispose of any lands which
were not required for the purposes of the undertaking.
Section 9 of the London and North Eastern Railway Act 1935 provided that the
company should have power to sell any land which was not being used for the
purposes of its undertaking.
Section 59 of the British Transport Commission Act 1949 provided that
sections 127 to 131 of the 1845 Act 'and any other provisions to the same or
similar effect' incorporated in any enactment relating to British
Transport's undertaking should not apply to land acquired under that
enactment.
Mr Justice Hoffmann concluded that none of those three enactments had
repealed section 57 or section 102.
He was right on section 43 of the 1932 Act and section 9(1) of the 1935 Act,
under which there could only have been an implied repeal. Neither of them
carried any implication sufficient to deprive the hospital and the
Commissioners of the valuable rights given by sections 57 and 102.
In section 59(1) of the 1949 Act there was no implied repeal.
The question whether section 59(1) had expressly repealed sections 57 and
102 depended on whether sections 57 and 102 were provisions to the 'similar
effect' as the provisions of the code.
When one described one thing as similar to another, one meant something
which so resembled the other as to make it either pointless or impracticable
to differentiate between them for the purposes for which the description was
needed.
The purpose of section 59(1) was to cancel the effect of the code and other
provisions to the same effect. The effect of the code was to enable others,
by rights of pre-emption, to acquire from British Rail or its predecessors
superfluous land no longer required for railway purposes.
In the terms of the definition suggested, the effect of both section 57 and
section 102 so resembled the effect of the code as to make it pointless to
differentiate between them.
Sections 57 and 102 were effectively repealed by section 59(1) of the 1949
Act.
On that ground only the appeals should be allowed.
Their Lordships agreed.
For the hospital: Edward Nugee QC and Terence Etherton (Wilde Sapte)
For the Church:David Lowe QC and Charles Turnbull (Waltons &amp; Morse)
For British Rail: Gavin Lightman QC, John Whittaker and Bridget Lucas
(Nabarro Nathanson)
For National Carriers: Robert Reid QC and Simon Berry QC (McKenna &amp; Co)

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Peter Mason has been appointed to replace David Cawthra as chief executive
of Balfour Beatty, the construction arm of BICC engineering group.
Cawthra stunned the construction industry last September when he stood down
from Balfour, one of the country's biggest contractors, to become chief
executive of Miller Group, a privately owned construction company based in
Edinburgh.
Mason was formerly executive chairman of Norwest Holst, the British
construction group in which Compagnie Generale des Eaux acquired a 51 per
cent stake in January 1989.
Norwest last year generated a pre-tax profit of Pounds 8.6m on a turnover of
Pounds 338.52m. Balfour Beatty by comparison made a pre-tax profit of Pounds
37.7m on a turnover of Pounds 1.9bn.
Mason, now 45, graduated from Glasgow University in 1968 with a degree in
civil engineering to join Sir Robert McAlpine construction group. Between
1970 and 1976 he was a contracts manager with Faircloughs (now part of Amec)
before becoming construction director of Shanks &amp; McEwan.
He joined Norwest Holst in 1980 and became chief executive in 1985 shortly
before the company was acquired in a management buy-out. He became executive
chairman in 1991 following the takeover by CGE.

FT  13 MAY 92 / People: Civil servant joins Anglian Water
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Dinah Nichols, one of the senior civil servants responsible for the
flotation of the water industry in England and Wales over two years ago, has
joined Anglian Water, one of the 10 privatised companies, as a non-executive
director.
Nichols, 48, was head of the water directorate at the environment department
in the run-up to flotation. She played a leading role in what was one of the
most contentious and complex of all privatisations, and negotiated on water
standards with the European Commission.
'We are proud to have her with us because of her wide experience of the
industry,' says Roger Dickinson, Anglian's company secretary.
There will be no conflict of interest because the department has been
restructured following privatisation. Nichols is currently a deputy
secretary in the environment department responsible for property holdings,
construction and central support services. She has also been a director of a
subsidiary of John Laing, the construction company.
In the run-up to privatisation, when some of the former authorities were
very hostile to ministers and environment department civil servants, Anglian
Water, under the chairmanship of Bernard Henderson, took a more conciliatory
stance. The close contacts with senior officials have continued.
The company also announced the appointment of Jim Adams as an executive
board member. Adams, 62, has been with Anglian for 18 years and is currently
managing director of Anglian Water Engineering and Business Systems. The
subsidiary is responsible for computer systems and for assessing projects on
behalf of the core businesses of water supply and sewage treatment and
disposal.

FT  13 MAY 92 / Business and the Environment: Temperatures raised by free
market fever - Bolivia's tropical woodlands are being chopped down at a rate
which rivals Brazil
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BARHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Yet another tropical rain forest disaster is in the making. This time the
culprit is Bolivia. Its thickly forested eastern lowlands are being
devastated by logging companies and migrants in a repeat of the blunders in
neighbouring Brazil.
From the air, the virgin forests look like an endless dark green carpet,
occasionally slashed by broad rivers which reflect the sun in blinding
silver flashes.
Yet international aid officials estimate that the forests are being cut down
at a rate of 200,000 hectares a year. That represents a loss of about 0.5
per cent of the forest cover every year, among the world's highest depletion
rates.
The problem is free enterprise. Bolivia is one of Latin America's pioneers
in experimenting with free market reforms. It was even the first debtor
nation in 1987 to allow 'debt-for-nature' swaps, in which foreign debt is
swapped for local currency and used to pay for conservation projects. It
also claims to have some of the continent's most progressive environmental
legislation. But the weak, lame duck government is paralysed by indecision
and is in thrall to special interest groups. Bolivia may have released
companies from the weight of state control, but it has not prevented them
from committing environment plunder.
According to Cedoin, an independent La Paz information centre, the
government has granted 22.5m hectares of logging concessions - half the
country's forests. Aid officials complain that agencies like the World Bank,
which was implicated in Brazil's environmental catastrophe and is active in
Bolivia, are not doing enough to temper the free market fever.
The government did act in January 1990, when it approved the grandly-titled
'Historical Ecological Pause'. In theory this truce suspended all
environmentally aggressive activities while new policies were drawn up. But
environmentalists say no attempt was made to stop logging.
'It is frightening, it is uncontrollable - it is enough to make you cry. You
see areas being plundered, but there is no control. Nobody is responsible
for anything,' said one scientist.
Loggers only harvest the most valuable trees. This both reduces ecological
diversity and lowers the forest's economic value, which in turn reduces the
incentive to protect the jungle. Forestry officials earning Dollars 100 a
month do not think twice at taking bribes to let convoys of trucks loaded
with hardwoods past their checkpoints.
Land-hungry migrants, many of them miners who lost their jobs when
loss-making state-owned mines closed down, are also entering into the
lowlands.
Close to the deforestation front line is the ecological reserve that was
established under the pioneering 1987 debt-for-nature swap. The Estacion
Biologica del Beni, a 135,000 hectare reserve, lies in the forested
foothills of the Andes.
An important part of its work is developing sustainable development
strategies. 'Increasing agricultural production reduces pressure on natural
resources. Settlers do not destroy the forest for fun, they do it to grow
food. So we try to take our knowledge to them,' said Carmen Miranda,
assistant project co-ordinator. However, her work is being swept aside by an
avalanche of migrants.
Aid workers say the government has done nothing to organise the new
settlers. They receive no support or technical guidance, so they quickly
degrade the fragile forest soils. And as crops fail, they advance deeper
into the forest.
Meanwhile, promising mineral deposits have just been found in eastern
Bolivia. The government's draft legislation may meet international
environmental standards and multinational mining companies are taking more
care in protecting the environment; still, mining would represent yet
another threat to the region.
Yet, as Carlos Arze of the government's National Environment Fund, points
out: 'You have to balance the deterioration of the environment against the
in-flow of resources to a very poor country.'
The drug trade, the most extreme form of free enterprise and Bolivia's
largest source of hard currency, is also wrecking the environment. Farmers
plant coca bushes in unsuitable soils which are rapidly denuded, forcing
them to drench the soil with pesticides and artificial fertilisers. As if
that were not enough, huge soyabean farms that have sprung up around the
boom town of Santa Cruz de la Sierra, the eastern region's principal city,
eroding the soil and creating small deserts. The sand dunes have even become
a tourist attraction.
The World Bank is encouraging the government to limit the damage by
introducing land use controls, environmental impact studies and land pricing
mechanisms to curb land speculation. But officials are at a loss as to how
such policies would be made to work in a country where effective government
barely exists outside big cities.
Even so, there is hope. Growing environmental awareness and disgust at
corruption, plus pressure from aid donors and international development
agencies, is beginning to make the government take the environment
seriously.

FT  13 MAY 92 / Jobs: As old as Solomon, but still a mystery - Efforts to
define the activities that make up good management have made little useful
headway
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL DIXON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHAT have human beings been doing at least since Solomon's time 3,000 years
ago, without having a precise idea of how they do it? (Those last 10 words
will hopefully have ruled out any pretext for lewd responses.)
The answer is something a lot of readers do for their near-living - to wit,
managing. Solomon qualifies as a fellow practitioner by being on record as
establishing elaborate trading systems as well as carrying through
construction projects and moulding peace agreements.
But although what he achieved shows that he must have been a manager, how he
achieved it is a mystery. And the same goes for his successors today who,
whatever their achievements, can rarely if ever give a clear explanation of
the various skilled things they did to accomplish same.
True, it's not something that often worries them. Being typically men and
women of action, they are too concerned with getting results to bother their
heads analysing exactly how they do so.
The trouble is that, as many have sadly discovered in the latest recession,
there is an important difference between them and their managerial ancestor
of the 10th century BC. Compared with the likes of Solomon, they are far
easier to throw out of their job and, though perhaps more likely to live to
tell the tale, most will still need to earn the odd crust to sustain
themselves while telling it.
For managers who have suffered that fate, getting re-employed has probably
never been harder. To judge by reports from redundancy counsellors as well
as victims, with companies scrapping whole layers of management, recruiters
aren't much impressed by career resumes listing posts held in organisational
hierarchies, numbers of underlings and the like. Unless you're well
connected or otherwise lucky, such evidence that you're a manager is no
longer enough to win a new job. You must also be able to convey to employers
how you can manage so as to justify your pay in their particular outfit.
Alas, the chances of a successful outcome are not improved by the fact that
few companies themselves have a better than hazy idea of the detailed things
their managers actually do - as distinct from those they're theoretically
supposed to, at any rate. There is admittedly no shortage of knowledge about
the latter. Indeed prescriptions abound, the only problem being that they do
not always correspond with managerial work's complex reality.
Take for instance the formula, still taught in business schools, which was
laid down about 75 years ago by the French mining engineer Henri Fayol. The
essential activities of management, he declared, are planning, organising,
commanding, co-ordinating and controlling - and there's no doubt that
management can be thought of as compartmented in that way.
Whether it helps practitioners, however, is another issue. For one thing, it
doesn't shed much light on how to do the five things it cites. So my own
suspicion is that managers probably receive no more practical help from
being taught Fayol's formula than Moliere's bourgeois gentilhomme gained
from learning that ever since his babyhood he had been talking prose.
In more recent years, of course, such prescriptions have become a lot
longer, particularly with the past decade's vogue for dividing managerial
work into so-called competencies (sometimes spelt 'competences'). Hence it
is too soon to judge the extent to which the elaborated versions are of use.
Even so, I at least doubt the sense of the more grandiose schemes to take
management as a whole, wherever it's done, and split it into competencies
ranked in importance, which can be tested for the award of certificates.
As for the more modest efforts limited to management in just a single
company, albeit often big and widely diversified, time alone will tell. The
only forecast I would venture is that the outcomes will hinge on the methods
by which the competencies are identified.
If they're top-down assemblages, formulated by senior executives with or
without the aid of research by external consultancies, my bet is that they
will do more harm than good. But even bottom-up versions based on inquiries
reaching down to the ranks immediately above the shopfloor, won't
necessarily be any better. The key factor is probably how the inquiries are
conducted.
All such exercises are prone to well known faults, including the tendency of
prejudices on the part of those putting the questions to influence the
replies and the way they are interpreted. Such observer-bias would look to
be a particular danger in defining competencies - not least because
managers, being sharply attuned political animals, are apt to respond in
ways they think will be approved rather than with what they really think.
Fortunately, psychologists and the like have devised methods which reduce
such dangers, one example having the drab title of Repertory Grid. First
developed by an American called George Kelly in the 1930s, it is based on
his 'personal construct' theory. The idea is that from birth we piece
together individual frameworks which determine how we see the world, each
framework consisting of a set of yardsticks - or constructs - for judging
what we experience.
As an illustration, legend has it that a certain British foreman had only
one real construct for judging men. Those who wore polished black shoes with
laces were good; those who didn't were evil. And although most people have a
great many more constructs, each works in the same way by deciding whether
things are importantly similar to one another, or different. Moreover, while
the whole set will be exclusive to us individually, some of the particular
yardsticks will also be used by other people.
The method seeks out the constructs with little observer-bias because Grid
consultants ask no leading questions. They just write words on cards - say,
'you' on one card, 'me' on a second, and 'the gatepost' on another - then
put the trio before you and ask in which way you think any two of them
resemble each other while differing from the third. There's no limit on how
many stimulus words - known as 'elements' - can be used, but they are always
compared in threes, a pair against a singleton.
One psychologist using Grid to clarify what makes for effective management
is Fay Fransella of the Centre for Personal Construct Psychology in London.
She begins by getting top executives to name a sample of managers they think
good and another sample they think otherwise. Then, without letting any of
them know which group they're in, she runs them individually through the
process using a common set of elements.
The result is a number of shared constructs on which the two groups
significantly differ. For instance, a recent company study threw up three
such constructs.
One was the extent to which the managers were able to stand back from the
task-at-hand, and review their work in the context of the whole business.
Next came the importance set on being always available to subordinates for
consultation. The third was the emphasis put on understanding the jobs done
by subordinates, so as to be able to control them closely.
'The way the sheep differed from the goats wasn't always as everyone might
expect,' says Dr Fransella. 'Certainly, it was the effective group who stood
back and reviewed a lot. But they didn't let their staff consult them about
anything any time, as distinct from by appointment. And they weren't much
concerned to understand the details of the jobs done below them.
'It was the poorer group who knew the nitty-gritty and made themselves
always available. That's probably why they didn't have time for standing
back and reviewing.'

FT  13 MAY 92 / Parliament and Politics: Ex-Granada chief in satellite
venture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR DEREK LEWIS, former chief executive of the Granada television group, is
to set up a satellite television entertainment channel in a joint venture
between Thames Television, which lost its franchise in last year's
competitive tenders, and the BBC.
The venture will draw on the programme libraries of Thames and the BBC. The
channel is expected to be launched towards the end of this year.
Mr Lewis was forced to resign as Granada chief executive last year. One of
the factors which helped undermine Mr Lewis was Granada's investment in
British Sky Broadcasting, the satellite television network in which Pearson,
owner of the Financial Times, has a stake. His investment is now seen in a
more positive light following BSkyB's move into profit on an operational
basis.
Doubt has been been expressed about whether the BBC can take part in a
satellite service launched by the Independent Television Commission. Thames
is confident, however, that a suitable shareholding structure can be found.
Reeves, Thames Television's loss-making US production subsidiary, has won a
contract to make a series set in medieval England for the ABC television
network.

'What is agreed at that conference is only the beginning of the work that

done subsequently both in this country, the EC and beyond.'
Mr Major will attend the meeting with other leaders including President
George Bush of the US, who had previously said he had not decided whether he

Mr Hughes said earlier that proposals to be put at the EC Commission today
were 'a watering down of tough energy-saving commitments.'

FT  13 MAY 92 / Tec issues warning over pit closures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CONTINUED pit closures in Nottinghamshire would have a 'devastating' effect
on the economic and social life of the county, the North Nottinghamshire
Training and Enterprise Council (Tec) warned the government yesterday.
It called for a national energy policy based on the use of coal as a
strategic fuel.
This is the first political intervention by a Tec, 82 of which have been set
up to bring training closer to the needs of the private sector and to foster
business growth.
'Everything we do on the training and enterprise front can be negated by a
rapid reduction of the (coal) industry,' said Mrs Pat Richards, chief
executive of North Nottinghamshire Tec.
The stand taken by the Tec reflects disquiet in the region's business,
voluntary and political circles about the plans of - and for - British Coal.
Nottinghamshire County Council has this week published its coalfield
strategy for this year. It opposes coal imports and urges support for
deep-mined coal and the development of coal-fired power stations.
The county council and the Tec are to put pressure today on Mr Tim Eggar,
energy minister, when he visits pits at Ollerton and Rufford in the county.
They will seek assurances about the future of the local mining industry
under whatever organisation emerges after privatisation of British Coal.
The council and the Tec are seeking a meeting with Mr Michael Heseltine,
trade and industry secretary, to urge a review of government policy on coal.
British Coal, which has a representative on the Tec, supports the Tec's
position. But the corporation said yesterday that it could not put forward a
definite policy for the Nottinghamshire pits until prospects for supply
contracts to the power generators were clear and until the terms of
privatisation were settled.
More than three quarters of the coal mined in Nottinghamshire pits goes to
power stations along the river Trent.
British Coal said that 11 of the 12 remaining pits in the county were
profitable even though the selling price of Nottinghamshire coal is only
marginally higher than it was in 1985. The region's pits have reserves of
some 540m tonnes excluding the reserves at Asfordby, a mine under
development and due to come into production next year at the rate of 2m
tonnes a year.
However, 12 pits in the county have been closed since 1985. During this
period productivity per man shift has risen 64 per cent. The Tec fears that
further mine closures would be bad for the region.
Mines are the main source of employment in the area, directly providing more
than 12,000 jobs, and indirectly providing a further 4,000.

FT  13 MAY 92 / Cost threat to Drax seen
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIET SYCHRAVA
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN'S biggest power station - Drax in North Yorkshire - may be forced
out of business by the end of the century, according to National Power, the
privatised electricity generator which owns the station.
Drax, which supplies enough power for six cities the size of Liverpool, is
on the River Ouse near British Coal's Selby colliery complex, and burns
about 9m tonnes of coal a year. National Power argues that Drax could be
priced out of the new electricity market if negotiations with British Coal
over coal pricing cannot be resolved.
'It is a sign of how completely the whole electricity industry has been
turned upside down that the biggest and newest station in the market is
struggling to survive,' National Power commented. Mr Mike Grasby, manager at
Drax, warned that the station might be switched off most of the time because
of tough competition from gas-fired power stations. 'If the coal price is
not attractive . . . Drax will not run baseload,' he said. A baseload
station is one which runs most of the time.
That could prove disastrous for National Power, since Drax - which cost
about Pounds 2bn to build - supplies 25 per cent of the company's profits.
Drax pays British Coal about Pounds 400m for fuel compared with the Pounds
300m it would pay on the world market. National Power's existing contracts
with British Coal, which were put in place when the electricity industry was
privatised, ensure that the difference is subsidised by electricity
consumers.
When the contracts run out in March next year, this subsidy will disappear -
making British Coal uncompetitive - unless the government intervenes.
Regional electricity companies, which buy power from the generators to
supply domestic consumers, will choose cheaper gas-fired generation where
possible.
National Power has spent Pounds 700m on cleaning up Drax by fitting
scrubbing equipment which cleans the emissions. It is spending a further
Pounds 40m on burners that will halve other emissions from the station. The
high cost of the clean-up means Drax is already struggling to compete with
the new gas stations.
Mr Grasby has set stringent targets. This will mean cutting jobs and
changing working patterns. He is also fighting to improve the efficiency of
the station, though he says it is running close to its full potential.

FT  13 MAY 92 / Network of after-school clubs to be launched
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT is expected next week to announce funding for a national
network of children's after-school clubs and holiday playschemes to be run
through the Training and Enterprise Councils.
The move will be the first to be made by Mrs Gillian Shephard, the
employment secretary, in her role as cabinet minister with responsibility
for women's issues.
The policy will be aimed partly at countering criticism from the Equal
Opportunities Commission and other groups that the government has failed to
provide an overall childcare strategy and that out-of-school provision
remains patchy and inadequate.
The idea of funding the initiative through the 82 employer-led Tecs would be
to draw in private sector finance. Most employers would find it impractical
to run schemes themselves but may want to buy places in local after-school
clubs and holiday playschemes.
About 20 per cent of children of primary-school age are estimated to be
'latchkey' children, according to Kids Clubs Network, the voluntary group
which campaigns for after-school provision.
Ms Tess Woodcraft, Kids Clubs Network director, said there were between 400
and 500 after-school clubs in the UK, mostly run by parents on 'very tiny
grants'.

FT  13 MAY 92 / BP Chemicals to cut emissions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BP CHEMICALS, one of the world's largest producers of chemicals and
plastics, is to spend about Dollars 100m (Pounds 55.7m) a year on cutting
its emissions of hydrocarbons by half.
It has disclosed details of its emissions for the first time, and has
promised to reveal them annually. It has also pledged to cut by 1997 the
emission of hydrocarbons - which add to global warming - by half from 1990
levels and to cut solid emissions to water by two thirds. The move may put
pressure on other companies to follow suit. The company is committed to
spending Dollars 100m this year on its environmental programme, compared
with typical capital expenditure of Dollars 600m, and expects to spend
similar amounts in each of the next five years.
Mr Bryan Sanderson, chief executive, warned that the investment would be
reflected in higher prices to the consumer. 'The cost of being in the
chemical industry is going up,' he said. 'We have obligations to our
shareholders and our communities at our sites. This extra cost just adds
momentum to that.'
Emissions and waste generation in 1990 at the company's 10 largest sites in
Europe and the US, including five in the UK, totalled 170,000 tonnes,
equivalent to 3.2 per cent of overall production. These sites account for
only 75 per cent of output, but more than 95 per cent of all emissions.
Emissions of more harmful substances - which companies are required by law
to report - totalled 61,000 tonnes. Hydrocarbons accounted for around 45,000
tonnes.
The five UK plants at Baglan Bay and Barry, south Wales; Grangemouth on the
Firth of Forth; Hythe, Hampshire; and Hull, north Humberside; accounted for
69 per cent of the company's total emissions.
Mr Sanderson said the company's ultimate goal was to eliminate emissions.

FT  13 MAY 92 / Injury risk higher in company cars
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COMPANY-OWNED cars are about 30 per cent more likely to be involved in
accidents that cause death or injury than similar cars owned privately,
according to a Department of Transport report published yesterday.
This is partly explained by the higher annual mileages of company cars, says
the report. It also shows that high-performance cars are twice as likely to
be involved in fatal accidents as 'ordinary' versions of the same cars.
This supports the tough line being taken by insurance companies against
'hot' hatchbacks and similar vehicles. Premiums for such cars have risen
sharply under a revised pricing structure introduced by the Association of
British Insurers. However, the increases reflect much higher theft rates as
well as accidents.
A breakdown of all accidents in 1990 showed the BMW 3 series, Volkswagen
Golf GTi, Astra GTE and Ford Escort XR3i among those more likely to be in
serious crashes. Pre-1988 models were the worst, with 63 fatal or serious
accidents per 10,000 vehicles.
Among small cars, the risk of driver injury in an accident was highest for
the Rover Mini and lowest for an early version of the Nissan Cherry; in the
small/medium sector highest-risk cars were the 'old' Ford Escort, Triumph
Acclaim and Vauxhall Chevette, with VW Golfs the lowest risk. In the
medium-car sector, those most at risk were Ford Sierra Sapphire and Cortina
drivers, and least at risk were Renault 21 drivers. The highest risk in the
larger-car sector was the Saab 900, and lowest the Rover 800.
Among the main company cars surveyed, Ford's Sierra hatchback had the
highest injury risk and the Vauxhall Cavalier the lowest.

FT  13 MAY 92 / California riots focus minds on welfare reform: The governor
of the state claims unrest in Los Angeles is proof of the need for change
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ON the Friday morning when the burning and looting in Los Angeles stopped,
thousands of poor residents of the city's South-Central district had a more
pressing need than protesting.
They were standing in long lines waiting to collect their weekly welfare
cheques at the few post offices still operating in the riot-stricken area.
The queues demonstrated the dependency on social benefits of large portions
of the population in the economically depressed inner city. Yet Los Angeles'
1.3m welfare recipients, and 2.3m throughout California, now face the
possibility of swingeing cuts in payments.
Mr Pete Wilson, California's Republican governor, plans to place proposals
for welfare reform on the state ballot in November when he will ask voters
to approve an immediate 10 per cent cut in welfare benefits.
After six months, payments would be reduced by an additional 15 per cent to
families that include an able-bodied adult.
The governor says his proposed Taxpayers Protection Act is designed to
'encourage personal responsibility and independence while discouraging
welfare dependency,' which he believes has contributed to the breakdown of
social values he recently linked to violence in Los Angeles.
'Generous' welfare payments have become a disincentive to work, he
maintains. A person working full time on a minimum wage may be little better
off than another on welfare under the current system, although both must
struggle to make ends meet.
The governor's initiative would allow welfare recipients to earn more before
payments are withdrawn. It would also create a new Dollars 34m (Pounds
19.2m) job training scheme and a programme designed to encourage teenage
parents to stay in school.
However, the primary thrust of the reform is directed towards the growing
problem of single, unsupported mothers who represent 87 per cent of the
state's welfare case load.
Only 6 per cent of single-parent families that go on public assistance do so
because the parent becomes unemployed, according to state statistics. 'The
overwhelming majority go on welfare because of divorce or separation from
the income-earning spouse, or because a non-working single woman gives birth
to a child,' says Mr Russell Gould, secretary of the California Health and
Welfare Agency.
Although the problem affects all segments of the population, it is
particularly acute in the black community. While blacks make up only 7 per
cent of California's population, they represent almost 25 per cent of
welfare recipients. All but a small fraction of these are single mothers.
Under the governor's proposals mothers would get no extra benefits if they
give birth to additional children while on welfare, and benefits for
first-time mothers would be eliminated. Payments to teenage mothers would
also restricted, forcing them to live with parents if they are to receive
welfare.
Critics charge that the proposed cuts would lead to increased homelessness
and poverty. Children's rights advocates are incensed.
Yet by presenting welfare cuts as an alternative to reductions in state
spending on education, Mr Wilson has effectively pitted the interests of
middle-class Californians against those of the underprivileged and, to a
large degree, whites against minorities.
The governor maintains 'tough times require tough choices' between 'runaway'
welfare costs and the needs of California's growing school-age population.
Few would deny that California faces a welfare spending crisis. In the
current fiscal year the state expects to pay Dollars 2.8bn in Aid to
Families with Dependent Children (AFDC), the primary welfare programme.
Without any changes, AFDC costs are projected to rise to Dollars 3.1bn next
year, a 54 per cent increase over expenditures in the 1988-89 fiscal year.
Before the Los Angeles riots, Mr Wilson dismissed as 'partisan twaddle' the
charges of some democratic legislators that his proposals were an attack on
poor minorities that could incite 'class warfare'.
Today the potential for a violent reaction to welfare cuts is not so remote
and some political analysts expect voters to reject the 'reforms' rather
than risk more social unrest and racial tension. Others fear a backlash as
voters associate welfare families with the looting, arson and murder that
swept through Los Angeles.
Mr Wilson says voters will view the Los Angeles riots as proof that the
welfare system needs to be reformed. 'If people think about what causes
people to go out and. . . engage in brutality. . . they're going to conclude
that it reflects a total absence of real values.
'And, unfortunately, a lot of it comes back to the fact that we've got kids,
through no fault of their own, being neglected from early childhood.'

FT  13 MAY 92 / Deal sets up trade in pollution permits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   CHICAGO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE first US deal to trade pollution rights was announced yesterday when the
federally-owned Tennessee Valley Authority said it had agreed to purchase
allowances to emit 10,000 tons of sulphur dioxide, a key cause of acid rain,
from privately owned Wisconsin Power &amp; Light.
The terms of the sale were not disclosed, but the estimated cost is Dollars
2.5m to Dollars 3m (Pounds 1.4m to Pounds 1.7m).
To help ease the high costs of converting to cleaner technologies, the US
government has created a system under which 'dirtier' utility companies can
buy allowances for emissions from 'cleaner' companies that have exceeded the
federal standards.
The deal is, in essence, a forward contract on the allowances that will be
issued next year by the Environmental Protection Agency under the terms of
the 1990 Clean Air Act. The act requires that utility companies cut their
sulphur dioxide emissions in half by 2000, or from a national total of 19m
tons to 9m tons. The first deadline for partial compliance is 1995.
The allowances have been allocated, but will not be in the hands of
utilities until an auction in March 1993.
Mr Erroll Davis, president of Wisconsin Power &amp; Light, said the transaction
'clearly demonstrates that a market-based approach can be an effective way
to address environmental problems'.
There has, however, been scepticism over how well such a market can work, as
state and locally-controlled utilities have been slow to set any clear
policies for trading allowances. There are also doubts over whether a given
community would want to be 'dirty' even at a lower cost, and over how to
price the allowances.
The Chicago Board of Trade, the world's largest futures market, plans to
begin trading futures contracts on the allowances, dubbed pollution futures.

FT  13 MAY 92 / US court rejects challenge over unitary taxation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SAN FRANCISCO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CALIFORNIA'S supreme court has rejected a challenge to the state's 'unitary
taxation' system, in a decision that could cost multinational companies with
operations in the state about Dollars 792m (Pounds 447m) in disputed tax
payments.
British, Japanese and other foreign companies have been fighting
California's unitary tax for a decade. The case decided by the supreme court
was brought by Barclays Bank of the UK in 1984, and challenged the
constitutionality of the tax assessment method.
Unitary tax is calculated according to a formula that takes into account a
company's worldwide earnings and taxes a portion of them according to the
percentage of activity in the state. A company that has 10 per cent of its
world sales, property and payroll in California, for example, would be taxed
on 10 per cent of its global profits, even if the California operation made
no profit.
The court rejected the claims of multinationals - which have been backed by
the Bush administration as well as by foreign governments, including the UK
 -that the tax method interferes with the US federal government's ability to
conduct foreign policy.
While acknowledging that four US presidents have opposed state unitary
taxes, the California court held that Congress, which holds power over
foreign commerce, has not opposed the tax.
The law 'does not give executive (branch) officials carte blanche to declare
state tax methods null when they irritate our trading partners,' Justice
Armand Arabian wrote in a unanimous decision.
The state court referred back to the state appeals court the relatively
minor issue of whether calculating unitary tax places an unfair burden on
foreign multinationals.
David Barchard adds: Barclays said in London last night it was disappointed
but not surprised by the Californian judgment. The bank, which had hoped to
secure a tax refund of about Dollars 30m, plans to appeal to the US Supreme
Court in a last-ditch effort to overturn the judgment.

US producer prices rose a modest 0.2 per cent in April, the Labour

recovery is restraining price advances, Reuter reports from Washington.
April's rise in the producer price index matched 0.2 per cent advances in
both March and February.
The report generally supported financial analysts' views that price
pressures are under control and that the Federal Reserve, the US central
bank, has room to lower interest rates without fanning inflation.
During the first four months of the year, producer prices had risen by a
seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1 per cent, the department said. In 1991,
the PPI fell by 0.1 per cent.

FT  13 MAY 92 / Australia to reduce immigrant numbers
</HEADLINE>

   SYDNEY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AUSTRALIA, one of the world's most popular destinations for European and
Asian emigrants, yesterday announced plans to cut immigration by 27 per cent
next year to about 80,000 people.
Mr Gerry Hand, the immigration minister, said Australia would also require
more skills and a higher level of competence in English from applicants
other than refugees and close relatives of earlier migrants.
The changes follow an anguished debate over the historically high level of
immigration in the wake of an 18 month recession which has increased
unemployment to 10.4 per cent.
Immigrant organisations argue that high immigration benefits Australia by
increasing economic activity. However, the government has accepted trade
union arguments that immigration has worsened unemployment during the
recession.
Mr Hand said the level of immigration for future years would be decided in
the light of 'national economic and social objectives'. He said the intake
was likely to average 80,000 for several years.
The cut was welcomed by Senator Peter Walsh, a prominent campaigner against
high immigration, who urged a further cut to a maximum of 60,000 people in
1993-94.
Immigrant organisations said the increased focus on English language skills
was discriminatory, and would discourage applications from talented migrants

FT  13 MAY 92 / Indian MPs angry over US ban on Russian rocket deal

MEMBERS of the Indian parliament strongly attacked the US yesterday over a
ban on exports to the Indian Space Research Organisation (Isro) announced in
Washington.
Mrs Margaret Alva, the minister for public grievances, assured parliament
that the government would do everything 'to protect national honour, dignity
and choice' in face of the US ban on trade and technological dealings with
Isro. She said the government 'would respond in an appropriate way'.
The Bush administration's action, apparently in a public display of its
resolve to control missile proliferation, was taken in order to compel Isro
and Russia's Glavkosmos to terminate a Dollars 250m (Pounds 141m) contract
to transfer rocket technology to India.
The move follows a recent improvement in US-India relations, as shown by the
Bush administration's support of an International Monetary Fund loan to
India, an agreement to hold joint naval exercises, and India's recognition
of Israel.
MPs were alarmed that the move against Isro is the second time Washington
has acted against India recently. Less than a fortnight ago it withdrew
preferential duties on Indian pharmaceuticals because of India's failure to
protect US patents.
The Indian government claims its space programme is meant to improve
communications and weather forecasting and is entirely peaceful. India chose
Russian rocket technology after all western countries had turned it down on
the grounds that it would improve India's missile launch capability. India
has refused to sign the non-proliferation treaty, arguing that it
discriminates in favour of existing nuclear powers.
The Russians were proposing to supply a Missile Technology Congress Regime
class system capable of carrying a 500kg payload to a minimum distance of
300km.

FT  13 MAY 92 / Executives lament waning of Japanese work ethic: Employee
enthusiasm brought in question
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPANESE executives are lamenting the disappearance of a breed of model
worker delighted to do unpaid overtime, inspired by a passionate loyalty to
the company, and even 'genetically inclined' towards hard work.
As part of a intensifying debate over whether the Japanese work ethic is
being eroded by 'western-style' individualism and materialism, the
Keidanren, the country's federation of economic organisations, surveyed
2,125 chief executives and senior managers, who agreed that the work ethic
is changing but disagreed on the impact.
The debate was inspired by Mr Akio Morita, the Sony chairman, who recently
announced that managers should reduce working hours, raise salaries,
increase dividends and generally become more philanthropic. He also
suggested that companies abandon their quest for market share and
concentrate on profit quality.
Mr Morita's comments were taken by some outraged executives as a direct
attack on the terms and conditions of a social contract that had ensured
Japan's success. There was also concern that employee enthusiasm may be
undermined by a chairman's confession that they were under-compensated.
The federation's survey showed that Japanese companies are indeed dependent
on the enthusiasm of their staff, as 88 per cent of the companies rely on
'service overtime,' that is, unpaid overtime.
About 53 per cent of managers surveyed said unpaid overtime should decline
but only 19.4 per cent supported an end to the practice, which makes the
working year far longer than the official estimate of 2,052 hours. Japan's
company-backed unions say the actual figure is closer to 2,400 hours.
Asked to describe their employees' source of motivation, 30.9 per cent of
managers said promotion prospects were most important and 26.9 per cent
thought it was salary, but 37 per cent suggested that the love of work
itself was the prime factor.
A Nippon Steel executive said 'Japanese corporate energy' comes from
Japanese-style work values, self-realised desire and a now-declining but
still essential love of teamwork. And an executive at JR Tokai, the railway
operator, said 'individualism' is replacing company loyalty as the most
important source of motivation.
Increasing wealth was seen as a threat to the old order, with 41 per cent of
executives believing work values were being eroded by material comfort,
though 23 per cent thought not, and 36 per cent were unsure. These questions
prompted the not uncommon answer that the Japanese work-style is
fundamentally different because of the rice cultivator tradition -
westerners are said to be imbued with the spirit of hunter-gatherers and
thus have become more individualistic and aggressive.
Mr Tsuneo Aki, vice-chairman of Obayashi, the construction company, said
that as cultivators, Japanese people had to toil more diligently. The
result, he suggested, was that Japanese became 'genetically inclined' to
working hard, with genes quite distinct from those of westerners.
Other executives said Japanese workers are less efficient than their US and
European counterparts, while unnecessary 'service overtime' is clocked-up by
employees unwilling to leave the office before their managers even if they
have nothing to do.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE PAINFUL slowness of vote-counting following this week's Philippine
elections prompted a flurry of accusations of cheating yesterday from
politicians who appeared to be losing.
Police defused three bombs aimed at disrupting electricity supplies around
the capital Manila and which may have been intended to disrupt the counting
of ballots from the elections on Monday. Earlier, bombs had caused slight
damage to electricity installations on Monday night.
Right-wing military rebels of the Reformed the Armed Forces Movement (RAM)
issued a statement to the media accusing the incumbent administration of
President Corazon Aquino of organising the bombs to manipulate election
results in favour of her preferred candidate, Mr Fidel Ramos, former defence
chief.
'Let this serve as a warning that our forces beginning at 6pm today will be
in a state of readiness to move against the Aquino government should it
persist to manipulate election results by any means,' said the RAM
statement, which was dated May 13.
Mr Ramos stood by Mrs Aquino through six coup attempts. Three were led by
RAM, including one in December 1989 which frightened potential foreign
investors and nearly toppled the government.
Unofficial counts last night of a fraction of the 27m votes cast gave the
lead in the presidential race to Mrs Miriam Defensor Santiago, a
sharp-tongued lawyer who has campaigned against corruption.
Close behind were Mr Ramos and Mr Eduardo Cojuangco, Mrs Aquino's estranged
cousin and a wealthy associate of the late dictator Ferdinand Marcos.
Mrs Imelda Marcos, widow of Ferdinand and herself a candidate, asked for a
halt to unofficial vote-counting after it became clear she was trailing in
the presidential race and said it was possible the media were being 'used'
by 'dubious elements'.
Some officials have expressed fears that a wave of protests from losing
candidates could create a crisis akin to that in 1986, when Mrs Aquino
ousted Mr Marcos in an uprising sparked by protests against massive election
fraud.
Mrs Santiago said yesterday that she was jubilant at her early lead. If she
won, she said, it would deal a blow to the Philippines' oligarchic political
system based on influential families.

FT  13 MAY 92 / The bamboozle that burst the Bombay bubble: The scandal that
threatens to turn a stock market slide into a crash
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID HOUSEGO and RC MURTHY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Like any bubble the Bombay stock market boom had to burst one day.
But as the Central Bureau of Investigation launched an inquiry into what
seems to be India's worst-ever financial scandal, the fears are that a can
of worms could be opened which will turn the market's two-week slide into a
crash.
After the Bombay Stock Exchange index tumbled yesterday a further 10 per
cent to 3,086, the most sanguine expectation was that the market would
bottom out at 2,500 - or 43 per cent down on its peak in April.
The second concern is that both the extent of the abuses and the market's
fall could deal a savage blow to the government's efforts to develop the
fledgling capital market as an instrument to tap public savings for both
private sector and public sector investment.
One of the immediate results could be that fresh public issues will be more
difficult to launch or could be postponed. The market had been expecting
Rs40bn (Pounds 800m) of new issues - including a big issue from the Grasim
(Aditya Birla) group to finance new refinery at Mangalore in southern India
 -in the coming month. Reliance, the petrochemicals group had also been
hoping to raise Dollars 100m in a Euro-issue at a tentative price of Dollars
10 a share. But this will be much trickier with Reliance's own share price
dropping yesterday to Rs260 on the Bombay market.
Faced with disarray not only on the stockmarket, but in the bond and money
markets, the government's hope in calling in the CBI is of a surgical strike
to remove the offenders and to clean up the market. It would welcome a fall
in the index - which at its peak had been trading at unrealistically high
average price-earnings ratios of more than 45 - but wants to prevent a
disorderly tumble. A revival of private sector investment through capital
market funding is crucial to the government's strategy for restructuring
industry and boosting exports.
After a dizzy trippling of prices over the last year in response to the
government's liberalisation plans, the market has dived 30 per cent over the
last fortnight. This followed the disclosure that large funds - as much as
Rs30bn - had been illegally syphoned out of the interbank market in
government securities to fuel the share price boom.
The difficulty in limiting the damage is that those who have so far been
implicated in the scandal are no minor players. Mr Harshad Mehta, the
first-generation Bombay broker who had to repay Rs6.2bn to the State Bank of
India, the largest state-owned commercial bank, because of irregular
securities trading, was more than anyone the architect of the bull run this
year. He proclaimed not only the dramatic rise in the market but publicly
announced which shares he was backing. Those he chose have since taken the
hardest tumble with Associated Cement (ACC) dropping a further Rs1,100 on
Monday to Rs4,400 after reaching a peak of Rs10,500 on April 2.
Mr M J Pherwani, who has resigned as head of the National Housing Bank,
headed the Unit Trust of India, a state-owned - and the country's largest -
mutual fund for 10 years. He was also the chairman of a government-appointed
committee that recently recommended a revamped national stock exchange. As
chairman of UTI, he was a lead player in the bull market of the late 1980s.
He was forced to step down from that position because of his allegedly links
to the Ambani family who control Reliance and who were accused of market
manipulation.
Both Mr Mehta and Mr Pherwani are well connected both in the Bombay
financial market and among politicians and the top civil servants in Delhi.
Other senior banking executives including Mr K. Margabandhu, chairman of the
Calcutta-based United Commercial Bank, and Mr C L Khemani, deputy managing
director of the State Bank of India were asked to take immediate leave.
The diversion of funds was possible because of the chaotic securities market
in which bankers receipts are traded. Bankers receipts are promissory notes
issued by banks to each other in trading on government bonds. The Reserve
Bank of India (the central bank), which acts as a bond depositary for banks,
had fallen badly behind in registering security transfers because this part
of its operations is still not computerised. 'There was a systems failure,'
Dr Manmohan Singh, the finance minister, told parliament on Monday.
But the inadequate supervision that is now seen to have characterised the
bond market is also true of the stock market where insider trading and the
rigging of prices is known to flourish. 'Entry, holding and exit are all
hazards in this market,' Mr G V Ramakrishna, the chairman of the Securities
and Exchange Board of India said six months ago. Not much has changed.
The diversion of funds from the bankers receipt market occured through the
issue of false paper and the illegal use of securities as collateral to
raise fresh funds. The abuses were due to both the bull market of the last
year and to the archaic trading system. Brokers seemed to have won the
confidence or connivance of bankers dealing in bonds.
The suspicion of fraud surfaced in mid-April but came to public notice a
fortnight later as commercial banks started to reconcile accounts for the
accounting year ending March. It was at this point that the State Bank of
India realised it was owed Rs6.2bn by Mr Mehta and forced him to settle.
As a fall-out from this Mr Mehta was unable to meet other obligations -
including payments to the National Housing Bank. Mr Pherwani attributes
National Housing Bank's inability to deliver on cash or security payments of
Rs3.4bn to Canara Bank on Mr Mehta defaulting on his obligations to him.
These transactions occurred within the framework of the bankers receipt  - a
normally narrow interbank market trading in government and public sector
bonds. Banks' investment in the market none the less exceeds Rs1,400bn.
Until recently the market has focused on banks purchasing some Rs10bn a
month of bonds to meet statutory liquidity requirements set by the Reserve
Bank.
But the market became active in February anticipating a fall in bond prices,
especially long-dated securities, on reports of a possible interest rate
rise on new bonds the government was to issue in March. Banks entered
futures swap deals promising deliveries after the coupon rise. This occured
on March 17 with long-dated bonds rising 0.5 per cent to 12.5 per cent. Some
banks had already sold short.
Bond market players used the bankers receipt to register transactions which
require immediate cash payment but leave delivery of the security to later.
With the Reserve Bank unable to police a fast expanding market because its
own registering of transactions fell behind, the opportunities and
temptation for fraud grew.
In the coming days the government will use the weight of the state-owned
institutions to prevent an uncontrolled fall in the market - hoping that
foreign portfolio investment will emerge to provide a safety net.
However small investors will already have been frightened by the market's
sharp descent and could go on selling.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CHINA is planning to set up a special economic zone in Lhasa, the troubled
capital of Tibet, Reuter reports from Beijing.
The zone will imitate those operating in China's flourishing coastal
regions, the official China Daily said yesterday.
It quoted Tibet's vice governor Gyamtso as saying lack of open-mindedness
had impeded the region's development in the past.
Tibet has been rocked by sporadic riots since Buddhist monks demonstrated
against Chinese rule in late 1987, prompting police to open fire on
protesters.
The region's exiled spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama, says more than 1m
Tibetans have been killed since China took control of his country, now
called the Tibet Autonomous Region, in 1950. He said on Monday that
youngsters in the region were becoming impatient with his message of
non-violence.
China Daily said Tibet's local government is drawing up preferential
investment policies for the Lhasa special economic zone, including tax
breaks and low land-use fees.
The isolated region plans to open several new border trading ports, it said
without giving details. Currently Tibet's sole air link is with Chengdu, in
neighbouring Sichuan province.
'The action is part of Tibet's efforts to open its door wider to the outside
world and step up economic development, in the wake of (senior leader) Deng
Xiaoping's urge for bolder reform,' Gyamtso told the newspaper.
He said the region was considering a second economic zone in Jiangzi county,
200km (125 miles) from the Indian border.

FT  13 MAY 92 / UK and Vietnam sign deal on refugees' return
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENTS of Britain and Vietnam yesterday signed an end to Hong
Kong's 13-year struggle to cope with an inflow of Vietnamese boat people, by
agreeing to the forcible repatriation of all those found not to be political
refugees.
Mr Alistair Asprey, Hong Kong's secretary for security, estimated the
overcrowded camps which currently house about 56,000 illegal Vietnamese
immigrants could be emptied in three years.
The agreement, signed in Hanoi yesterday morning, is the final stage in the
October 29 statement of understanding between Britain and Vietnam. This
permitted the forcible return of all new non-refugees and of so-called
double-backers who had returned to Hong Kong after being voluntarily
repatriated to Vietnam.
Lord Wilson, Hong Kong's outgoing governor, welcomed the agreement. 'What we
really want is that as many people as possible should volunteer to go back
to their homes and I hope that this new stage in the process of reaching
agreement with Vietnam will encourage that,' he said.
The news was broken to the inmates of the 10 detention centres in Hong Kong
last night, but there were no immediate outbreaks of violence.
A concern remains that the government will have to use force in the
repatriation of some boat people who have waited in appalling conditions for
almost four years rather than return to what they claim will be inevitable
persecution. Mr Asprey would only say that everyone would have the
opportunity to return under conditions of 'order, safety and dignity'.
There has already been a significant fall in the number of boat people
arriving in Hong Kong since the October accord. This year there have so far
been only seven arrivals, compared with 3,920 in the corresponding period in
1991.
This is thought to result from the October agreement and to a reduction in
the amount payable to those who volunteered to return. Mr Asprey said he did
not consider it was a reaction to the riots that killed 21 Vietnamese in a
refugee camp in February.
He said the agreement would be likely to encourage a rapid increase in the
number of Vietnamese volunteering to return.
At present there are 22,466 boat people who have failed the screening
process and will be forced to return to Vietnam. There are a further 29,562
which have yet to go through the screening process, while there are only
3,434 designated refugees remaining.
'One of the main objectives is to make it clear there is no future for them
in wasting their lives in the camps, in the forlorn hope that they will get
access to resettlement. That will not happen,' he said.
Mr Asprey emphasised that neither Hong Kong nor Britain had agreed to any
financial assistance connected with the agreement with Vietnam. However, the
European Community has recently started a Dollars 120m (Pounds 67.7m)
programme to aid re-integration of returnees.

FT  13 MAY 92 / World Trade News: Hardwood curbs could deplete forests
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
CURBS on world trade in tropical hardwood could result in more forest
depletion rather than conservation, Mr Carlos Alberto Primo Braga, economist
in the World Bank's International Trade Division, says.
In a study of how trade policies have affected forest use in Brazil and
Indonesia, he argues: 'Use of export restrictions visited additional
environmental degradation on Indonesia's wet tropical forest than a proper
resource management programme involving a tax on all timber at the logging
stage would have done.' The findings challenge environmentalists who have
fought for a ban on trade as a main plank in their push to protect the
world's forests.
Mr Primo Braga sets out the rate forests are being lost and shares
environmentalists' concern over the plight of tropical wet forests. Forest
depletion has already significantly affected the economy of some developing
countries, like the Philippines, Nigeria and Ivory Coast, he notes. If the
pace of deforestation continues unchecked through the 1990s, the number of
net exporters of forest products among developing countries would fall from
33 to 10 by the year 2000.
World Bank studies show that about 60 per cent of depletion is due not to
trade but farming and cattle ranching, with the balance split between road
building, urbanisation, fuelwood and logging: 'Activities geared to the
domestic market ..are the main players in the deforestation process.' His
case is vividly illustrated in Brazil, where commercial logging accounts for
less than 1 per cent of GDP, and for under 1 per cent of export revenues.
Much of this is concerned with coniferous and eucalyptus logging in the
south of the country, rather than tropical forests. Of total hardwood
logging, 10 per cent goes on to the export market, the rest being used
inside Brazil.
As a result, trade measures against Brazil's exports are useless. They have
no influence on the deforestation process, and they lull environmentalists
into a false sense that progress is being made. Instead, they should be
focusing on the core problems: poverty, development projects, migration, and
government subsidies for logging and cattle ranching. The error of trying to
use trade measures to slow deforestation is shown differently in Indonesia,
where hardwood products account for 14 per cent of export earnings, with
over 40 per cent of production exported.
Indonesia's outward orientation is not just due to government policies, Mr
Primo Braga argues. Indonesian hardwood is more competitively priced, since
its forests have higher densities of commercially valuable trees; the light
colours of Asian hardwoods are preferred by consumers in developed
countries; access to forests is easier; and it is closer to the world's main
importer, Japan. Indonesia introduced trade curbs first on logs, then sawn
wood, under a strategy of encouraging higher value-added production in the
country. The result: intensified depletion of forests, since local
processors using inefficient machinery need more logs for every unit of
output than counterparts in Japan or Canada.
'If Indonesian sawmills and plywoods were operating at the world
technological frontier, the same production of sawn wood and plywoods
achieved in the second half of the 1980s could be reached with an annual
economy of 3.3m cu m of logs.' This would have cut annual log harvests by 10
per cent. A ban on trade in tropical hardwood would tend to depress its
price. An import ban would 'assign a lower value to forests, and (encourage)
less careful management of the resource, providing greater incentives to
convert forest land to other uses.'

FT  13 MAY 92 / World Trade News: Tale of the sheep and a grizzly bear
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A GRIZZLY bear may be bad news to sheep farmers, but an environmental asset
to the wider public. Does a government kill the bear, or compensate farmers
for lost sheep? If it kills the bears, are other governments entitled to
protest by banning imports of its sheep meat? Gatt, which polices world
trade, believes countries should have freedom to decide how to resolve their
environmental problems, and other countries are wrong to use trade
instruments against them if they disagree.
This challenge to the use of extra-territorial sanctions to force 'good'
environmental practices on other countries has aroused anxiety that a lack
of international agreement on environmental standards and practices will
make it a 'pig in the middle' in trade disputes. The US 'dolphin-tuna'
controversy was a first, but others are pending, such as Swedish and Swiss
bans on imports of chickens raised in cages.
The World Bank provides support for Gatt's role: 'By promoting the use of
more appropriate environmental policies that address the source of a problem
directly, Gatt is very much 'for the environment'. Gatt rules can protect
(developing countries) from new forms of protectionism under the guise of
environmental policy, reinforce the respect of sovereignty in trade
relations, and shift emphasis from the use of trade sanctions to
negotiations. The rule-based multilateral system protects the interests of
small countries against power-based unilateral policing by large countries.'
Other ways of pressing countries to change environment policies could
include product labelling and financial or technological transfers: 'Trade
forums seem to be the wrong places to address environmental issues. The
source of the problems is not in trade, but in the need to (take proper
account of) environmental costs in prices, to address bad policies, and
clarify property rights.'

the environmentalists and protectionists in alliance against free trade as a
cause of environmental problems.
The alliance is likely to grow, the bank says, because environmental groups
believe, mistakenly, that trade weapons can achieve higher environmental
standards internationally, and industries have found they are more likely to
win protection when they wed themselves to an environmental cause.
Environmentalists are wrong to prefer trade weapons because these usually
involve tariffs or quota arrangements, the cost of which fall not on the
polluter, but the victim - the consumer. Instead of the 'victim pays
principle', governments should stick to the 'polluter pays principle', which
argues for taxes on polluters, and subsidies to induce improvement.
Such measures are often unpopular with voters, so governments tend to choose
trade weapons such as tariffs as an easy option, even though they are a
'second or third best' solution to environmental problems, the bank says. It
challenges the basis of the alliance, saying environmentalists aim for
effective environmental controls, while protectionists want to eliminate
competitive differences regardless of whether this involves a levelling-up
or levelling-down of environmental standards.
'Producers opposed (to free trade) increasingly find themselves on the
defensive, intellectually and politically. They need to find new allies.
Defending trade curbs on the grounds they are necessary to protect
environmental quality fills both needs.'

SCHINDLER, the world's second biggest lifts and escalators group, is seeking
substantial revisions to the terms of its joint ventures with Jardine
Pacific of Hong Kong for serving far eastern markets.
Mr Bruno Donni, chief executive of Schindler's lift and escalator division,
said the terms of the joint ventures, set up in 1974 and 1980, now appeared
unfair to the Swiss group, and it was determined to change them this year.
'Our target is to take over the companies for ourselves, but we are open to
leave a minority position for Jardine,' he said.
Mr Donni said Jardine was not eager for change, but Schindler was trying to
explain its position.
Jardine has a 60 per cent stake in Jardine-Schindler, which sells and
services Schindler products in Korea, Taiwan and countries in the Asean
trade grouping. It also has minor stakes in Schindler ventures in China.
Annual sales of these companies are about SFr300m (Pounds 115m).

FT  13 MAY 92 / Machine tool industry holds EC crisis talks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LEADERS of Europe's recession-torn machine tool industry are holding crisis
talks with the European Commission in an attempt to win agreement on the
first EC-wide industrial policy for the sector.
The initiative by the Dollars 19bn European sector reflects fears that the
recession has seriously damaged the competitiveness of a strategically
important industry. Output fell by 8-10 per cent last year, due to the
near-total collapse of east European business and a sharp decline in the US
and western European markets.
The downturn has exposed the financial weakness of a fragmented industry of
1,500 producers, and raised questions about the survival of several leading
companies.
The talks are being spearheaded by Cecimo, the umbrella body for 12 European
machine tool associations, which earlier this year submitted to the EC a
document outlining the sector's plight and listing a raft of short- and
medium-term measures.
Cecimo wants an EC framework programme to revive manufacturing investment by
Europe's mechanical engineering sector, through measures such as tax
changes, faster depreciation, capital grants and lower interest rates.
Financial and fiscal matters are still the responsibility of EC member
states, but Cecimo is keen that individual countries can select from a range
of initiatives which will not be blocked by the EC.
Medium-term measures include better financial and fiscal incentives to carry
out cross-border mergers, and improved access to EC research and development
programmes for the industry's predominantly small and medium-sized
companies.
But the organisation also wants, as a priority, the creation of a 'European
pool' for machine tool control systems, motors and drives to challenge the
supremacy of Fanuc, the Japanese producer.
Cecimo's approach to the EC has been encouraged by the Bangemann paper of
November 1990 which laid out a new industrial policy strategy for the
Community. The group is hoping for an EC communication on the mechanical
engineering industry in the second half of this year, in which the problems
of the machine tool industry would be addressed.

FT  13 MAY 92 / Gonzalez adopts tough line over general strike
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE POLITICAL atmosphere in Spain has sharply deteriorated ahead of a half
day general strike planned for May 28, with Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez
promising to 'guarantee' the right of people to work during the strike and
the unions threatening action against the media.
The unions, which called the strike - and a further full day stoppage in
October - to protest at a government decree that cuts unemployment benefits,
have also widened their protest to include an attack on government plans to
introduce strike legislation and cuts in public sector industries.
Mr Gonzalez, who intervened in the growing dispute for the first time
yesterday, urged the unions to call off the strike.
'Whoever wants to work on the 28th will be able to do so,' he said. The
unions are likely to mount pickets outside factories and offices to stop
people breaking the strike.
Mr Gonzalez also said the government would ensure minimum levels of public
sector services would be maintained. The government's strike legislation,
about to be put to parliament, is designed legally to enforce such services
in the public and private sectors and attempts to impose them on May 28 are
likely to be stiffly resisted.
The prime minister said the benefit cuts had been made as part of Spain's
plans to converge its economy to higher EC standards and to enable the
country to enter economic and monetary union as a founder member of Emu in
1997 or, at the latest, 1999.
Mr Gonzalez denied he had any differences of opinion with Mr Carlos
Solchaga, the finance minister, who drew up the convergence plan containing
the benefits decree, and insisted that Spain had no alternative but to enter
Emu with its more powerful EC partners.
Some observers in Madrid believe that by widening their demands beyond the
repeal of the benefits decree, the unions may be tacitly acknowledging that
public support for strike action against the decree only may be hard to
sustain.
It seems likely, though, that the strike call will be adhered to on May 28
and that the action will effectively shut down the country.
But this, experience suggests, will not necessarily imply support. During
the last general strike on December 14, 1988, many people simply took the
day off as a holiday.
Newspapers have reacted angrily to demands they publish a message from the
unions on their front pages on the day of the strike.
The unions have also told radio stations only to play music during the
strike, to be broken by news broadcasts. Television channels have been told
to display their test cards. The unions have said if the media do not agree
to these demands by tomorrow they will take action against them.
In an angry editorial, El Pais, the country's most prestigious newspaper,
described the demands as blackmail.
The Spanish Senate is due to complete a debate today on the convergence plan
drawn up by Mr Solchaga. The government has said it would admit small
changes being asked for by two large regional parties but the plan is likely
to become law without significant changes. It will then be submitted to a
meeting of EC finance ministers before the Lisbon summit at the end of next
month.

FT  13 MAY 92 / Greece cuts taxes in fiscal reform package
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KERIN HOPE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ATHENS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Greek government yesterday launched a wide-ranging fiscal package
intended to boost revenues through broadening the tax base and curbing tax
evasion.
The new legislation, tabled in parliament, is also expected to promote
growth by streamlining corporation tax, at present hemmed in by complex
regulations which serve as a disincentive to investors, finance ministry
officials said.
Reduced income tax rates introduced in the bill will at first cause a sharp
drop in revenues, estimated at about Dr50bn (Pounds 144m) for 1992.
The top income tax rate will fall from 50 to 40 per cent, while the
threshold for paying income tax rises to Dr1m, excluding junior civil
servants and other white-collar workers. In 1993, the top income tax rate
will drop to 30 per cent.
Tax on corporate profits, currently between 42 and 50 per cent, is reduced
to a single 35 per cent rate and companies are required to revalue fixed
assets every four years.
Stricter penalties for tax evasion include lifting of bank confidentiality,
confiscation of professional licences and jail sentences for major
offenders.
Greece's most notorious tax evaders are self-employed professionals such as
doctors and lawyers who avoid issuing receipts for their services. Under the
new system, doctors must keep registers of their patients and lawyers are to
be taxed under a co-efficient worked out with their union.
The black economy in Greece is estimated to have grown from 25 to 40 per
cent of gross domestic product over the past decade, indicating that the
government loses more than Dr400bn in revenues every year.
Hopes of making the fiscal reforms effective rest on a new computer system
now being installed, with the capacity to cross-check tax returns
nationwide. By mid-1993, all Greek internal revenue offices should be
computerised.

THE RUSSIAN government plans to take over at least part of the Commonwealth
of Independent States strategic nuclear forces, the deputy head of the CIS
general staff, Lieutenant-General Victor Barynkin, said yesterday. He did
not specify what proportion, saying this had yet to be negotiated. Gen
Barynkin said President Boris Yeltsin had approved the plan last week.
This decision runs counter to a CIS agreement last December under which all
former Soviet strategic nuclear forces were to remain under CIS joint
command.
Russia also wants to create its own missile early warning system. Gen
Barynkin said the existing system could be 'full of holes' once Azerbaijan
and Ukraine took over radar stations on their territory.

FT  13 MAY 92 / European freedom of movement may end at Dover: Britain's row
with its EC partners on border controls
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN'S long-simmering dispute with the European Commission over frontier
controls is coming to the boil, just in time to embarrass the UK government
as it takes over the EC presidency in the second half of this year.
As in so many aspects of Community policy, the issue boils down to a matter
of trust. Will Britain trust its partners sufficiently to remove all
controls on people and goods entering the UK from the rest of the EC? The
short answer at the moment is: no.
The dispute stems from the 1986 Single European Act's commitment to a single
market defined, in Article 8a, as 'an area without internal frontiers' by
the end of 1992.
Britain contends that this freedom of movement only applies to EC citizens,
and that, as Mr Douglas Hurd, the UK foreign secretary, stressed this week,
'we are justified, indeed have the obligation, to maintain our controls on
non-Community citizens'.
But, technically, it is impossible to check the passports of non-EC 'goats'
without also checking the credentials of the EC 'sheep'.
Last week, the Commission delivered a long-expected legal opinion that
Article 8a requires an end to all controls, and was confident that, if it
had to take Britain to the European Court of Justice, it would win.
Such a legal battle could take a long time. In the meantime, there are
pressing and expensive tasks such as changing the infrastructure at EC
airports, if there really is to be a EC-wide free travel zone.
The Commission has been so absolutist in its interpretation of Article 8a,
because it fears that if frontier controls remain for just one reason -
checks on travellers - they can be used as an easy pretext for the return of
checks on goods, for fiscal, security, health purposes. In fact, the UK
Customs and Excise is busy preparing, like its counterparts elsewhere in the
EC, to move its fiscal checks inland.
Brussels has set aside Ecu400m (Pounds 280m) to retrain or re-employ the
250,000 customs agents who will be put out of work. From next year, truck
drivers will no longer have to stop at intra-EC border posts (except perhaps
on the Danish-German border) to file VAT and excise documents.
There is far less progress in finding alternatives to other border checking
activities such as controlling the movement of drugs, explosives, artworks,
and hi-tech goods of military potential.
Some problems appear intractable such as how to get rid of the quarantine
which the UK and Ireland impose on the import of cats and dogs. Finding
alternative ways of checking drugs, explosives and rabid animals, are
essential if Britain is to stop controlling the entry of people from other
points in the EC.
However, of even greater concern is the need to improve controls on the EC's
periphery. There is growing migratory pressure on the EC, traditionally
mainly from north Africa, but now from eastern Europe.
All 12 EC states are, in principle, ready to sign a convention 'on the
crossing of external frontiers' of the Community. But the convention is held
up by an Anglo-Spanish dispute about Gibraltar, with the UK wanting its
colony treated as part of EC territory, but Madrid insisting that travellers
from the Rock to Spain are crossing an 'external' frontier. The Portuguese
presidency of the EC is trying to broker a deal.
But this 'external' convention seems not to be enough for Britain to drop
its 'internal' guard.
It would set agreed rules for issuing visas to third-country citizens, for
which a common policy is provided in the Maastricht treaty. It would lead to
the Twelve exchanging information on undesirable aliens. It would also
require each state to impose immigration controls on incoming aircraft,
ships, cars and buses, which the other 11 could - but need not - rely on.
The convention contains a British-inspired declaration that other (ie
internal) controls can be maintained.
The Dublin convention on the treatment of asylum-seekers has also been
signed by the Twelve, though only ratified by Denmark and Greece.
Absent from this convention is the trust apparent in the 1990 Schengen
treaty setting up a free travel zone between Germany, France, Italy, Spain,
Portugal, and the Benelux countries. (Greece now wants to join Schengen.)
This far-reaching pact provides for elaborate co-operation between the eight
countries' police and immigration forces. But it has not proved quite the
trail-blazing treaty it was intended to be. Only France has ratified it, and
it has run into difficulties in the Dutch parliament.
None the less, in Brussels' view, Britain remains the main obstacle to a
frontier-free Europe. True, Denmark is dithering about dropping controls
because of its passport union with Nordic countries. But this will be eased
once they join the EC. Ireland will probably follow the UK lead.
Given Britain's island geography, it is 'plain common sense', Mrs Margaret
Thatcher, the former UK leader, used to say, for it to keep controls. But if
other countries show they can enforce proper controls on their parts of the
EC's external rim, it will become plain common sense for British officialdom
to abandon Dover.

FT  13 MAY 92 / SPD warns of threat to democracy: German opposition fears
Bonn policy towards east is fostering growth of far right
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GERMANY'S democratic system will be 'threatened' if there is not an early
and radical change in government policy towards eastern Germany and the
costs of unification, the opposition Social Democrats (SPD) warned
yesterday.
Accusing the coalition government of Chancellor Helmut Kohl of 'disguising'
the extent of economic collapse in the east of the country, of
underestimating the costs of recovery, and of lacking any serious ideas to
deal with it, Mr Bjorn Engholm, the SPD leader, announced his own readiness
to form an alternative government.
The escalation in the conflict between the opposition and the government
appears to be a direct consequence of a clear swing in the latest elections
to extreme right-wing parties, and to growing talk of the need for a grand
coalition between the SPD and Mr Kohl's Christian Democrats (CDU) to deal
with the unification crisis.
In spite of his blunt criticism, Mr Engholm has agreed to take part in
cross-party talks on May 27, provided that they discuss the government's
budget crisis, and its entire strategy for reviving the east German economy.
At the same time he has ordered his party machine to prepare a complete
alternative government programme, to be ready within two months, in an open
challenge to the Kohl coalition.
Yesterday the party agreed to call for a new tax surcharge on the
higher-paid, and on German enterprises, to reduce the yawning public sector
deficit, currently running at DM45bn for central government alone.
The direst warning came from Mr Harald Ringsdorff, chairman of the Social
Democrats in the eastern state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, who warned that
'parliamentary democracy will be in danger' if there was no improvement in
the eastern economy. He said evidence from schools in the former east
Germany suggested that half the pupils, even in the elite 'gymnasium'
schools, were listening to parties from the extreme right.
He said that the real level of unemployment meant that one in every two
potential workers was jobless in many areas, and he called for a change in
the entire industrial strategy of the Treuhand privatisation agency to
promote active restructuring of old enterprises.

UNIDANMARK, Denmark's second largest banking group, expects a first-half
loss this year, weak conditions in the bond and share markets since the end

Standard &amp; Poor's, the US credit rating agency, said that it was reaffirming
the bank's A1 Eurocommercial paper rating. The rating has been on credit
watch since February 24.
The bank has made substantial losses on involvement in London's Docklands,
the commercial and residential development in east London.
'Not only has the market and the economy collapsed. The promises of
improvements in the infrastructure in the area were not met either,' he
said.
The bank reported a DKr1.6bn (Dollars 251m) loss in 1991 after making large
bad loan provisions.

FT  12 MAY 92 / Russians agonising over privatisation: Capitalism is almost
unknown  - but if sell-offs fail, all fails
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD and MARTIN WOLF
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Russian government is soon to embark on the toughest and most delicate
part of its reform process: turning state property into private hands.
If it fails, all fails. Only the creation of a property-owning class can
institutionalise the market system which government ministers are struggling
to tear out of the ruins of state socialism.
It is an enterprise more fraught with danger, even, than the liberalisation
of prices at the start of the year. Prices have been raised before, if not
by so much, but private property and capitalist ownership and control are
unknown to almost everyone in the former Soviet Union. Even before the 1917
revolution, it had only a tenuous and unpopular existence.
The privatisation programme is already late, and has so far realised little
of the over-ambitious target of Rbs92bn from sales set by the government for
this year. That is because the ministers still agonise over a delicately
balanced set of privileges and opportunities which they hope will allow this
most decisive of reforms to take root in hard ground.
Its lateness means that it will get fully under way just as unemployment,
still very low, begins to rise in the second half of this year. The
government thus faces an unenviable coincidence: the selling of companies
which provided job security at the same time as job losses mount.
Mr Anatoly Chubais, the privatisation minister, said in a recent interview
that three main tasks were to be achieved in 1993: the privatisation of
small enterprises by auction or tender; the transformation of large
enterprises into joint stock companies; and the creation of a system of
privatisation vouchers to be distributed to citizens.
On small privatisation, Mr Chubais admitted the government would resort to
'standard bureaucratic procedures', to force local administrators to
privatise 50-60 per cent of shops by the end of this year, and to transform
larger enterprises into joint stock companies and privatise part of these by
the end of 1993.
Regional governors, who are appointed by the Russian president, will be
given quotas of businesses to be privatised, and will be dismissed if they
fail to meet those quotas. Mr Chubais said: 'Normal bureaucrats don't want
to be the first to privatise but they also don't want to be the last. The
way is now clear. The decision to privatise is now a decision of the
government and of President (Boris) Yeltsin. We have enough instruments to
force local authorities to do the job.'
A State Programme of Privatisation of State and Municipally-Owned
Enterprises has been prepared by the government with the assistance of
experts from the World Bank. It still has to be endorsed by the parliament
 -as does a law on bankruptcy, which Mr Chubais said was now complete, and
which will allow companies that cannot survive to go to the wall.
The minister emphasised: 'There will be privileges for different parts of
the population: it is very important that people do not feel this exercise
is for the benefit of the old nomenklatura and the mafia.'
Workers, for example, will receive 25 per cent of the equity in larger
enterprises, and managers 5 per cent, both in the form of non-voting shares
free of charge. A voucher system, which will allow all Russian citizens to
receive shares in the companies as of right, is being worked out, and will
be launched in the autumn, though this is an extremely complex task. For
Russians who can afford to pay  - of whom a part would be drawn from those
who had been high in the previous power structure, or who had acquired their
money illegally  - there would be an open auction of shares, without any
privileges.
There will be resistance 'and so we must be quite flexible,' said Mr
Chubais. 'But we cannot stop 'nomenklatura privatisation' (the system under
which managers, sometimes in co-operation with the workers, take over the
company by making themselves the owners of the shares). We have had no legal
basis for privatisation until now: all privatisation has been semi-legal.
The only way to curb spontaneous privatisation is to introduce a normal
legal structure.'
Foreigners will be allowed to play a part. The government intends to
'multiply the book value of the property (sold to foreigners) by some
coefficient,' says Mr Chubais. 'There could be special auctions only for
foreigners, but this is still to be decided.'
In the energy sector, the object of most attention from foreign companies, a
special programme of privatisation and exploitation rights is still being
debated. The state oil corporation bosses, hostile to extensive rights for
foreign companies, believe that all they need is more money and technology,
and that with these they can themselves turn round the fall in production
and exports.
The experience of Nizhny Novgorod, to which Mr Chubais and his colleagues
look with hope, has been offset by the experiences of Moscow and St
Petersburg, where most shops have simply been handed over to the workers
through fear that auctions would court too much unpopularity. Mr Chubais
dismisses the capital as 'another republic', and insists on a more open
system.
It will need a steady nerve to see it through.

FT  12 MAY 92 / London Stock Exchange: Bid hints drive Footsie to new record
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LONDON market began the new three-week trading account in excellent
fashion, with a renewed flurry of takeover speculation plus another sizeable
bought deal, and the FT-SE 100-share Index climbed to its fourth consecutive
closing record peak. It was finally 12.1 higher at 2,737.8.
Takeover speculation sprang from the intense activity after the market
closed last Friday, when it was revealed that Hanson had sold its 2.82 per
cent equity holding in ICI, some 20m shares, to Goldman Sachs, the US
investment bank, via a bought deal.
The game in the market at the opening yesterday was to 'spot the new Hanson
bid target', with a fistful of big names getting the takeover target
treatment. Towards the close there were also stories that a big takeover,
unconnected with Hanson, could be in the making. Asda, the supermarket
group, was one name put forward as a possible bid candidate. Turnover in
Asda shares has rocketed during recent sessions.
Bid speculation was spiced by another strong performance from the futures
market and the latest in a series of confidence-boosting showings by
sterling against the dollar and the D-Mark.
There was momentary confusion in the equity market at the outset of trading,
when it was abundantly clear that a series of marketmaker input errors had
distorted the Footsie, which was initially shown as 180 points up.
Swift technical adjustment ensued and the Footsie was subsequently indicated
as being some five points ahead minutes after trading commenced. The early
running among the leading issues was taken up by stocks viewed in the market
as potential bid targets for a re-armed Hanson.
Dealers said Allied-Lyons, Trafalgar House, Blue Circle, Tarmac and a host
of others had been given an early shot in the arm by the bid suggestions.
By mid-morning the market had accelerated to a new intraday all-time high of
2,744.5, up 18.8. From then on, profit-takers began to gain the upper hand.
A couple of programme trades were reported during the morning, with at least
one weighted to the sell side.
A quiet opening by Wall Street saw the Footsie slip further to show a net
gain of eight points in mid-afternoon, before staging a late rise as the US
market began to move ahead.
BTR provided the market with the latest in a long line of bought deals by
selling its 4.1 per cent stake (some 31m shares) in Pilkington, among the
world's leading glass makers, to BZW, the investment bank. Ironically,
Pilkington has been one of the market's strong takeover favourites.
Last Friday's sale by Hanson of its ICI stake remained a big talking point.
Goldman Sachs, which bought the shares from Hanson, was said to be still
carrying a large block of the shares on its trading book.
Equity turnover continued to please, reaching 651.6m shares yesterday. The
value of customer business last Friday jumped to Pounds 1.88bn, boosted by
the ICI bought deal.
Senior dealers were not unduly concerned at the latest surge by the equity
market, although some expect a correction in the near term.

FT  12 MAY 92 / London Stock Exchange: BTR sells stake in Pilkington
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A FLURRY of excitement gripped the London market yesterday afternoon, as
word went round that international conglomerate BTR had sold its 4.1 per
cent stake in Pilkington, one of the world's biggest glassmakers, for which
it unsuccessfully bid in November 1986.
After the market closed it was confirmed that BZW had bought the 31.2m
shares for Pounds 50m, or 161p apiece. There were suggestions in the market,
however, that only about 16.2m shares of the total had been placed at 162
1/2 p, with unconfirmed reports that around 11.2m had been pre-sold. One
leading marketmaker was seen to have been an aggressive bidder for
Pilkington stock in the dying minutes of the session, offering up to 166p a
share.
BTR closed 2 firmer at 495p, while Pilkington eased a penny to 163p.
Fisons slips
Pharmaceuticals group Fisons declined 10 to 369p ahead of today's annual
meeting as French stockbroker Societe Generale Strauss Turnbull lowered its
profits forecast for the company.
Strauss analyst Mr Peter Laing said he had serious doubts over the fate of
two Fisons products banned in the US last year after a dispute on production
standards and methods.
He doubted whether Opticrom, an eye allergy treatment, would get back in the
US market as its US patent ends next year. He added that anaemia treatment
Imferon could be overshadowed by a direct competitor developed in the US. Mr
Laing shaved his 1992 estimate to between Pounds 220m and Pounds 225m from
Pounds 240m and cut his 1993 forecast to Pounds 260m from Pounds 310m.
Northern rises
A buoyant food manufacturing sector was headed by Northern Foods, which
surged 19 to 618p on the back of recommendations from two brokers.
Nomura analyst Mr Carl Short was positive on the stock at the house morning
meeting yesterday, citing Northern's recent underperformance and the
proposed reform of the Milk Marketing Board as his reasons. County NatWest
issued a large research note on the sector in which Northern was highlighted
as one of several stocks forecast to outperform the market.
Other food manufacturers were strong, with UBS Phillips &amp; Drew said to be
short of stock. Bid talk fingering Hanson and Nestle as possible predators
further lifted sentiment. Booker, also recommended by County, gained 24 to
474p, Cadbury-Schweppes 8 to 495p, Dalgety 13 to 435p and Unigate 15 to
353p.
Troubled chemicals company MTM jumped 10 to 63p ahead of tomorrow's figures.
Selected property issues were strong on press talk of further interest rate
cuts this year. One analyst also said that some companies were indicating a
slight rise in site valuations. British Land rose 7 to 201p, Hammerson
Ordinary 19 to 428p and Land Securities 10 to 455p.
Press reports that the fifth terminal at London's Heathrow airport will not
be as expensive as previously expected pushed BAA up 8 to 653p, with
analysts saying the company was unlikely to need a rights issue to finance
the project. Associated British Ports was lifted 10 to 440p by a favourable
annual meeting.
Speculation that Lucas Industries was considering a rival bid for Dowty
Group left the former off 6 at 147p. Dowty ended unaltered at 187p.
There was caution ahead of today's figures from Marks and Spencer, with
analysts nervous over the level of their sales forecasts for the stores
group. The shares slipped 2 to 330p.
Chunky volume in Asda - a further 15m shares were traded yesterday following
last week's heavy turnover - did little to rid the market of takeover
speculation, although most analysts were dismissive of the day's rumours.
The stock added 2 3/4 at 31 1/2 p.
Vague bid talk also surrounded Kwik Save, which rose 19 1/2 to 640p xd.
Concern that US investment house Goldman Sachs might be having some
difficulty getting away the whole of Hanson's 20m-share stake in ICI
overshadowed the chemicals group, which slipped 8 to 1395p. Goldman bought
the shares at 1400p each and was said to be offering them at 1410p.
Conglomerate Hanson, which made Pounds 28m profit from the stake and is
reckoned to be readying itself for another big bid, rose 5 to 243 1/2 p.
However, analysts believe it is set to announce a fall in half-year profits
of around 15 per cent to between Pounds 490m and Pounds 505m when it reports
on Thursday.
A report that US investment house Smith Barney had softened its enthusiasm
for Glaxo held back the pharmaceuticals group on both sides of the Atlantic.
In London, Glaxo closed a penny off at 776p.
Smith Barney removed Glaxo from its short-term recommendation list,
replacing it with Pfizer, which has had several new product launches lately,
but kept it on its principal buy list.
Reuters was firm after a presentation to analysts in Geneva last week. The
company was enthusiastic on its new automated foreign exchange system
Dealing 2000-2, and Hoare Govett reiterated its buy stance on the stock. The
shares were 20 stronger before easing with the market to close 6 up at
1242p.

FT  12 MAY 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow advances to record high
in slow trade
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Wall Street
US EQUITIES once more reached record levels yesterday, but the power of the
advance was somewhat undermined by the lack of participation in one of the
slowest trading days of the year, writes Karen Zagor in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced 28.17 to 3,397.58, but a meagre
157.6m shares changed hands on the big board. Declining issues trailed those
advancing by 640 to 1,083.
Gains were less pronounced in the transportation sector, where the Dow Jones
Transportation average added only 2.62 at 1,402.28, while the Dow Jones
Utilities average eased 0.13 to 213.88.
Among other market indices, the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was 2.44 higher at
418.49, while the Nasdaq composite put on 1.37 to 587.13.
Wall Street took its opening cue from higher overseas markets in the absence
of any domestic market stimulus. Traders will receive a clearer picture of
inflation from today's release of April's producer price index and
tomorrow's announcement of the April consumer price index.
Among featured issues, Wal-Mart climbed Dollars 1 to Dollars 53 in heavy
volume on the back of predictably strong first-quarter earnings of 34 cents
a share, against 27 cents a year ago from the big discount retailer.
May Department Stores, which also reported quarterly earnings yesterday,
firmed Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 55 7/8 . The company had net income of 60
cents a share in the first three months of this year, compared with 56 cents
a year earlier.
A number of blue chip stocks moved higher in heavy trading, including IBM,
up Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 93 7/8 , BankAmerica, Dollars  5/8 ahead at
Dollars 48, and Philip Morris, which gained Dollars 1 to Dollars 79.
General Dynamics edged forward Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 66 1/4 after news
that the company has agreed to sell its missile operations to Hughes
Aircraft.
The big three US auto makers weakened, with Chrysler losing Dollars 1/4 to
Dollars 18 5/8 , Ford down Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 44 3/8 and General Motors
Dollars  1/2 lower at Dollars 39 3/8 .
Seagate Technology was one of the most active over-the- counter stocks,
firming Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 16 3/8 . Trading was also heavy in MCI
Communications, Dollars  1/8 easier at Dollars 32 1/2 , Sun Microsystems,
Dollars  1/2 higher at Dollars 30 1/4 , Lotus Development, Dollars  3/4
cheaper at Dollars 30 3/4 , and Microsoft, down Dollars  1/2 at Dollars 114.
Canada
TORONTO surged 1.6 per cent as pressure on bank shares lifted after the
market finally heard some encouraging news on Olympia &amp; York. Newspaper
reports said the UK government may relocate some of its offices into O &amp; Y's
Canary Wharf.
The TSE 300 composite index closed 52.8 up at 3,427.2. Advances outnumbered
declines by 336 to 219 after volume of 28.03m shares valued at CDollars
357.9m.
Bank shares, pressured over the last two months by fears of heavy losses
from exposure to debt-troubled O &amp; Y, gained 81 points or 3.12 per cent as a
sector.
Bank of Nova Scotia rallied CDollars 1 1/8 to CDollars 20 7/8 , Canadian
Imperial moved ahead CDollars 1 1/8 to CDollars 28 5/8 , Royal Bank of
Canada gained CDollars 1 to CDollars 24 7/8 and Bank of Montreal scored an
advance of CDollars 1 to CDollars 44 1/4.

FT  12 MAY 92 / Money Markets: Speculation ignored
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
IN SPITE of recent speculation in several national newspapers about the
possibility of further base rate cuts, the sterling money markets continue
to take the view that another cut is unlikely to be engineered by the Bank
of England before the summer is over.
It was not just that rates in nearly all markets were unchanged yesterday. A
far more striking indication of the market's negative mood was that trading
for the September sterling contract was much more active than the one for
June. Dealers say this indicates a particularly downbeat view on rate cuts:
there are still six weeks to go before the June contract expires, and the
fact that futures traders are now focusing on September suggests that they
expect little change in rates for a while.
Analysts say the market's view on the prospects for base rate movements has
been mostly accurate in the last 18 months. The money markets have
accurately predicted six out of the eight cuts that have been engineered by
the Bank of England in that time. Only in two cases have they guessed wrong:
when they scotched all thought of a half-point cut last September and when
they thought that there would be a cut before the April general election. So
those who are confident about a rate cut should take note that rates in the
interbank market changed little yesterday. Three-month money, a key
indicator of future rate movements, was unchanged at 10 1/8 per cent. No
less important was the fact that the yield curve was flat at 10 1/8 from one
week right out to five months. Only after six months does the cost of money
ease by  1/16 of a percentage point.
Futures trading in sterling was slow, with the June and September contracts
moving in narrow ranges. September sterling ended at 90.30, suggesting that
base rates in five months' time will be at 9.70 per cent.
In the discount market, the Bank of England forecast a shortage in the
morning of Pounds 1.05bn. The Bank bought Pounds 303m of Band-1 bills at 9
7/8 per cent and Pounds 400m for resale to the market on June 1 at 9 15/16
per cent. After the shortage was revised to Pounds 1.1bn, the Bank purchased
Pounds 30m of Band-1 bills at 9 7/8 per cent. In the afternoon, the shortage
was revised to Pounds 1.2bn. After providing late assistance, the Bank's
total help for the day was Pounds 923m.

FT  12 MAY 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar fails to sustain gains
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DOLLAR was unable to sustain the gains that it made last Friday on the
foreign exchange markets, in spite of underlying uncertainty about the
German economy and thin trading in Japanese yen, writes James Blitz.
In London, the US unit drifted to the bottom of a half-pfennig range in late
trade, after spending a day in a market devoid of energy or direction. The
dollar ended at DM1.6405, after a previous close of DM1.6475. By midday in
New York, it was dropping back towards DM1.6350; it ended there at DM1.6383.
The US currency declined narrowly against the yen in London to finish at
Y133.15, from Y133.35. It eased further in New York to a closing Y133.
Much of the market's uncertainty is still due to the 6-point differential
between US interest rates and German short-term rates. Fears that the
Federal Reserve will cut its Fed Funds rate could be allayed when real
economy numbers for inflation, retail sales and money supply appear later
this week. Mr Paul Chertkow, chief currency strategist at Citibank in
London, commented: 'If the numbers for retail sales are good, that could be
a catalyst to buy dollars.'
In spite of its dollar gain, the D-Mark did less well against its
fellow-European currencies, amid persistent worries about Germany's
troublesome wage negotiations. A particular concern is that the powerful IG
Metall union, which represents 4m metal and engineering workers, said at the
weekend that it is looking for a 1992 pay rise of at least 6 per cent.
The markets also appear to have been unsettled by comments at the weekend
from Mr Helmut Schlesinger, the Bundesbank president, who said that the 5.4
per cent wage increase agreed by the main unions and the government last
week would lead to price rises and complicate the conduct of monetary
policy.
One winner against the D-Mark was the French franc, which closed at an
18-month high of FFr3.3626, compared with last Friday's FFr3.3630.
According to Mr Mark Austin, chief economist at HongKong and Shanghai
Banking in London, the market remains impressed at how the French
authorities engineered last week's reduction in bank base rates by
increasing bank liquidity. 'There is a realisation that the French have done
a clever thing to get base rates down without lowering the intervention
rate,' he said, 'so that there is no cost to franc investors.'
Two currencies lost ground to the D-Mark, however. One was sterling, which
closed  1/4 pfennig down at DM2.9425. The other was the Swiss franc, which
traded above 93 centimes to the D-Mark for the first time since 1980.
Traders believe that the Swiss currency is weighed down by a wide interest
rate differential in favour of the D-Mark.

FT  12 MAY 92 / International Capital Markets: Reduction in new bank lending
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE international financial system generated Dollars 255bn of new lending
last year, less than half of the Dollars 550bn of 1990, according to figures
published in the BIS quarterly review, writes Richard Waters.
The scarcity of new bank credit was at the root of the contraction, net
international lending by banks plummeting from Dollars 465bn to Dollars
85bn. Despite this, the final quarter of last year saw a slight recovery in
bank lending. New lending in the last quarter, at Dollars 30bn, was double
the previous quarter's.
Japanese banks accounted for much of this growth. They put on Dollars 23bn
of new international assets, most of it to fund the affiliates of Japanese
companies in other Asian centres. Japanese banks also continued to reduce
their dependence on foreign finance.

FT  12 MAY 92 / International Bonds: Attention focused on Eurofima Ecu500m
issue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
KICKING off a busy week, the international bond market was yesterday mostly
focused on three Ecu deals, in particular a large Ecu500m 15-year
transaction from Eurofima, the rail equipment financing company.
The Eurofima issue, lead managed by JP Morgan Securities, has not yet broken
syndicate but has already attracted a lot of attention because of its size
and maturity.
JP Morgan believes there is demand at the longer end of the Ecu yield curve
for a liquid issue as this area of the Ecu bond market is under-served - bar
a 15-year, Ecu400m issue from SNCF and an Ecu750m issue from Finland.
The Ecu market has fallen over the last month due to a combination of
factors - general concern over European Monetary Union, fears about the
ratification of the Maastricht protocol in some member countries and the
feeling that institutional investors are selling off their Ecu bonds.
JP Morgan argues the Ecu market is probably oversold. Other houses were
doubtful whether such a large issue could be easily placed. The lead manager
admitted it could take 'some effort' to get the issue away but said an
estimated Ecu200-250m has already been placed. The deal is priced at 4 basis
points over the 8 1/2 per cent Ecu OAT due 2002.
Nippon Telegraph &amp; Telephone's Ecu200m issue traded well, and was seen as
fairly priced. The reoffer price of 99.5 gave a yield of 8.878 per cent,
which compared favourably with other five-year maturities - although there
were a few grumbles that the lead manager - Swiss Bank Corporation - kept a
high proportion of the deal to sell to retail investors in Switzerland.
South Africa tapped the international capital market with a DM120m,
five-year issue for Telkom SA, the South Africa telecommunications utility.
The deal is the fifth since South Africa's 'rehabilitation' in the public
bond market last September, and follows D-Mark and Ecu-denominated issues by
the government, the Development Bank of Southern Africa, and Eskom (the
South African electricity utility).
The deal, which carried a government guarantee, appeared to be well-received
and attracted widespread interest from retail investors, according to
Deutsche Bank, the lead manager.
The pricing on South African issues has steadily fallen since September. The
Eskom deal - the most recent South African issue - was priced to yield 150
basis points over the five-year German government notes, which was seen as
quite tight pricing.
However, Deutsche Bank bucked this trend by deciding to price the Telkom
issue at 160 basis points over the five-year notes in order to ensure a
better reception for the issue. By mid-afternoon, Telkom was trading at
around 98.10, within fees.

FT  12 MAY 92 / Government Bonds: Treasuries rally on hopes of renewed Fed
easing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON and SIMON LONDON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US Treasury prices firmed slightly at both ends of the maturity spectrum
yesterday as investors continued to bet that coming economic data will
persuade the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates.
In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government issue was up  1/32 at 101
3/16 , yielding 7.890 per cent. At the short end of the market, the two-year
note was  1/8 higher at 100 5/16 , yielding 5.205 per cent.
The market did not wait long to add on to last week's big gains, which were
achieved in the wake of a mixed employ ment report and weak money supply
numbers.
Attention has now switched to this week's figures, which will include
reports on the latest producer prices index (today), consumer prices and
retail sales (tomorrow) and weekly jobless claims and money supply
(Thursday).
The thinking among more optimistic investors is that if the latest
statistics indicate the economic recovery is still worryingly frail, the Fed
may ease monetary policy one more time.
FRENCH government bond prices continued to rally yesterday following the cut
in bank lending rates last week and a long holiday weekend.
The benchmark 8 1/2 per cent French government OAT maturing 2002 closed on a
yield of 8.57 per cent, from 8.62 per cent at the opening and at the close
on Thursday.
Since German government bonds continued sideways, the yield spread between
the two markets at the 10-year maturity closed from 68 basis points to 61
basis points.
This is the lowest spread between the two markets since early March,
reversing most of the damage which resulted from political uncertainty
surrounding French regional elections.
The market continued to find support from the strength of the French franc,
which closed slightly higher in the European exchange rate mechanism, and
comfortably within its divergence limits against the D-Mark.
GERMAN government bonds were little changed in nervous, lacklustre trade
yesterday, with most investors held on the sidelines by uncertainty over the
current wave of industrial disputes.
The June bund futures contract on Liffe, the London exchange, opened at
87.19 and was trading slightly below this level in late afternoon. However,
trading volume was low at 41,000 contracts, little more than half the
trading activity seen last week.
In the cash market, the benchmark 8 per cent cash bund closed at 100.11 from
100.08, for a yield of 7.97 per cent.
Prices dipped in the morning session on the news that the German current
account deficit narrowed to DM300m in March from DM1.9bn in February and
DM6.4bn in March 1991. The largest change was in the volume of exports,
which rose from DM54.97bn in February to DM62.97bn in March.
Analysts said the strength of exports suggested the economy was not slowing
as quickly as had been assumed, with inflationary pressures possibly still
remaining.
UK government bonds were slightly weaker at the longer maturities yesterday
as investors focused on the medium-term outlook for UK inflation ahead of
official data expected this week.
The 9 per cent gilt maturing 2011 closed down just  1/16 of a point on the
day, at 99 for a yield of 9.026 per cent. The June gilt futures contract on
Liffe closed at 98.20, having opened at 98.27 and traded as high as 99.01
early in the session. Volume was slight at 21,000 contracts.
Short-dated gilts fared better, however, less disturbed by fears over the
inflation outlook and expectations of further government bond issuance. For
example, the 10 per cent gilt maturing 1996 closed up 1/32 of a point on the
day at 102 21/32 for a yield of 9.251 per cent.
Dealers expected little action ahead of retail price inflation data for
April, expected to be released on Friday. Analysts are expecting an increase
in the 4 per cent annual rate of inflation recorded in March. But forecasts
for April for year-on-year inflation range from 4.3 per cent to 4.9 per
cent.
Although much of the acceleration can be explained by statistical factors -
the way in which tax and mortgage rate cuts depressed the RPI this time last
year - any increase will focus attention on the UK's stubbornly high rate of
inflation.
JAPANESE government bond prices fell a shade yesterday, with concern over
anticipated supply of corporate bonds continuing to pre-occupy dealers.
The 10-year government benchmark bond issue No 129 closed the Tokyo day on a
yield of 5.595 per cent, from 5.555 per cent at the close on Friday.
Dealers said Tokyo Electric Power, the largest of the Japanese power utility
companies, was preparing to launch a Y100bn 12-year bond issue in the
domestic market.

<TEXT>
STANDARD &amp; Poor's, the US credit rating agency yesterday affirmed the top
triple-A credit ratings of the big three Swiss banks, contradicting the
opinion of Moody's Investors Service, its biggest competitor.
S&amp;P said that the top long-term credit ratings of Union Bank of Switzerland,
Credit Suisse and Swiss Banking Corporation would be maintained in spite of
an increase in loan losses and a decline in profitability.
Earlier this year, Moody's downgraded Credit Suisse to Aa1 and has placed
SBC under review for possible downgrade.
Standard &amp; Poor's said that the strong performance of all three banks was
'in marked contrast' to the general deterioration of bank credit quality.

WAL-MART Stores, the largest US retailer in sales terms, yesterday pleased
investors with news of a 26 per cent increase in first-quarter profits, to
Dollars 387m after tax.
Sales were up by a similar amount, at Dollars 11.7bn, in the three months to
the end of April, helped in part by Wal-Mart's aggressive new stores
programme. During the first quarter alone, it opened 15 new stores; expanded
and relocated another 38; and added seven outlets to its Sam's Clubs chain
of deep-discount wholesale stores.
The net addition of retail space during the first quarter totalled 3.89m sq
ft. The expansion has taken the Wal-Mart chain of discount stores to 1,735
outlets, with a further 215 Sam's Clubs. A year ago, the figures were 1,591
and 178 respectively.
At the earnings-per-share level, Wal-Mart made 34 cents in the first
quarter, compared with 27 cents a year earlier. Its shares gained Dollars 1
to Dollars 53 on the news yesterday.
Mr David Glass, chief executive of the aggressive Arkansas-based group, said
the figures reflected 'excellent cost control and sales that consistently
ran ahead of our plans'.
He suggested the company was 'well-positioned' to meet its sales and
earnings objectives for the rest of the year.

<TEXT>
NORDSTROM, the Seattle-based stores group and one of the stars of the US
retail sector in the late-1980s, has reported a 15.9 per cent fall in
first-quarter profits.
The fashion retailer, which has been hit by the west coast recession, said
it made Dollars 21.6m after tax in the three months to the end of April,
compared with Dollars 25.7m in the same period a year earlier.
Sales in the first quarter rose 8.7 per cent, to Dollars 663.8m. However,
Nordstrom's finance director, Mr John Goesling, said sales trends had not
'improved enough to offset the higher costs of doing business'. Its shares
yesterday edged higher, by  5/8 to Dollars 34.
Meanwhile, May Department Stores, which operates 319 department stores
across the US under names such as Lord &amp; Taylor and Kaufmann's, and 3,304
shoe stores, reported after-tax profits of Dollars 81m for the 13 weeks to
May 2. This compares with Dollars 76m in the same period a year earlier.
Total net retail sales in the period were up from Dollars 2.17bn to Dollars
2.3bn. Its shares rose  3/8 to Dollars 55 7/8.

<TEXT>
COSTS associated with coverage of the winter Olympics contributed to a sharp
decline in first-quarter net earnings at Turner Broadcasting System, the
media and entertainment group that controls the CNN cable network.
Although revenues were 12 per cent higher at Dollars 365.2m, the
first-quarter net profit was only Dollars 731,000 , against Dollars 3.8m a
year ago.
At the operating level the profit dropped by 9 per cent to Dollars 51.1m.
Revenues for the entertainment division of Mr Ted Turner's company rose by
20 per cent to Dollars 170.5m thanks to increases in subscription revenue
and advertising at the TNT cable network. But the entertainment unit's
operating profit fell to Dollars 16.1m from Dollars 27.9m in the first
quarter of last year.
Operating profits from the news division - which includes CNN - increased to
Dollars 42.4m from Dollars 31.1m on revenues that were 9 per cent higher at
Dollars 125.3m.
Losses on the sports division, which includes an equity stake in the Atlanta
Hawks basketball team, rose to nearly Dollars 4m from Dollars 2.1m a year
ago.
The New York Times, whose delivery drivers have been on strike since last
week, said yesterday the strike had cost millions of dollars. Mr Lance
Primis, president of the paper, said the losses consisted of plant and
equipment damage, lost sales and rebates to advertisers.
Mr Primis said he was unaware of distribution problems spreading beyond the
suburban areas of Westchester County and Long Island in New York and in
Connecticut.

FT  12 MAY 92 / International Company News: Wasserstein settles Interco suit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
WASSERSTEIN Perella, the investment banking business set up by two prominent
Wall Street bid advisers in 1988, has agreed to pay Dollars 18.25m to
Interco in settlement of a legal action brought against it by the St
Louis-based furniture and shoe manufacturer.
Wasserstein maintains that it has no liability to Interco, to whom it gave
investment banking advice in the late 1980s. It said that the settlement
'reflects growing concerns as to the unpredictability of the outcome of jury
trials, regardless of the merits of the case'.
Nevertheless, the payment will be seen as a further blow to the investment
banking firm, which has been losing ground in the bid-advisory league tables
in recent years.
Wasserstein was formed by Mr Joseph Perella and Mr Bruce Wasserstein, two
high fliers previously with First Boston. It ranked third in the merger and
acquisition league tables in 1989, according to Securities Data. It had
slipped to 12th place last year, and came 15th in the first quarter of 1992.
Interco had brought legal action against Wasserstein as a result of advice
received at the end of the 1980s. The company 'recapitalised' in 1988 in an
attempt to avoid a hostile takeover. This involved Interco taking on a large
amount of debt and paying special dividends to shareholders.
The company subsequently sought protection under Chapter 11 of the US
Bankruptcy Code after asset sales failed to generate as much money as
projected and earnings fell short of forecasts.
Interco sued its former investment banker, Wasserstein Perella, in January
1991, claiming that Wasserstein had delayed the sale of its Ethan Allen
subsidiary, and caused it to accept a lower price. The Interco suit had
originally asked for Dollars 109m, plus punitive damages.
In March last year, an 'examiner' - a bankruptcy and creditors' rights
lawyer - was asked by the bankruptcy court to consider whether the
recapitalisation gave rise to possible legal claims by the company and
creditors against former professional advisers.
In her report, the examiner concluded that the Dollars 2.8bn
recapitalisation did render Interco insolvent, and that there had,
therefore, been a fraudulent conveyance of assets. However, she spread the
blame widely, effectively exonerating Wasserstein on the grounds that
company officials has misled it.
'They (Wasserstein) performed their services at a level that was acceptable
by investment banking industry standards,' she said. The examiner added that
'their real problem was that they were not given complete information from
the company'.
However, her report did not address the Ethan Allen issue in any detail.
No claims were subsequently brought against Wasserstein Perella over the
recapitalisation itself.
The Ethan Allen suit was complex, but essentially it alleged that
Wasserstein 'failed and refused' to execute a fairness opinion which would
have allowed a proposed sale of the subsidiary in 1988 for Dollars 475m to
go ahead. The business was eventually sold for Dollars 385.5m in 1989.

FT  12 MAY 92 / International Company News: BA, KLM, Lufthansa close to
Hungarian carrier stake
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BUDAPEST
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH Airways, Lufthansa and KLM Royal Dutch Airlines have all emerged as
the leading contenders to acquire a minority stake in Malev, the Hungarian
national airline.
The contest between the three big European carriers to forge an equity
partnership with Malev is now reaching a critical stage. Price negotiations
between the various candidates and the Hungarian authorities are scheduled
to start later this month with Hungary hoping to complete a deal by the
middle of this year.
The deal, for about 35 per cent of the group, would not only lead to a
partial privatisation of the Hungarian carrier but strengthen it financially
and operationally through a partnership with a big western airline.
The funds raised by the equity sale will help Malev fund its Dollars 400m
estimated investment needs over the next two years. The airline is bringing
two Boeing 767-200 aircraft into service for routes to North America and the
Far East, and is linking up to international computer booking systems. The
European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), the multilateral
institution to promote economic recovery in eastern Europe, is also
evaluating an equity participation in Malev alongside the winning airline
bidder.
Credit Suisse First Boston, the investment bank, is acting for the Hungarian
authorities which will retain the remaining interest.
The attractions of Malev to airlines like BA, KLM or Lufthansa include one
of the most modern and profitable fleets among east European carriers as
well as access to Budapest's revamped Ferihegy airport. At the geographical
heart of eastern Europe, the airport could emerge as an important hub.
The proposed Malev transaction is similar to the recent investment by a
consortium including Air France and the EBRD in CSA, the Czechoslovak state
carrier.
Air France and its partners agreed to invest the equivalent of Dollars 60m
for a 40 per cent shareholding of CSA. But Air France itself put up only
Dollars 5m in cash.
Given the strong competition for Malev, bankers are hoping that the terms of
the western bid will be substantially better than that for CSA.
EBRD merchant bankers said yesterday that the bank's participation -
important in sweetening the deal for airline investors - would depend on the
nature of the airlines' offers. The EBRD appears anxious not to repeat the
controversy over its involvement in the CSA acquisition.
A US official argued that investment by a state-owned company like Air
France did not amount to privatisation, ran counter to the EBRD's mandate of
encouraging the private sector in eastern Europe, and therefore should not
be repeated.

FT  12 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Purchasing a tight grip on European hosiery
/ Considering the questions surrounding the rapid growth of Hartstone
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR STEPHEN Barker is a goliath in the world of tights and handbags. When
Hartstone publishes its results on Thursday, investors will be keen to learn
how this soft-spoken giant's ambitious plans are measuring up.
Pre-tax profits at the acquisitive hosiery and leathergoods group are
expected to have leapt from Pounds 7.3m to between Pounds 21m and Pounds
22.5m, while turnover will have more than trebled to about Pounds 237m.
The dividend should be raised by at least 50 per cent to 4.85p.
The architect of Hartstone's rapid expansion is undoubtedly Mr Barker, the
former accountant who picked up his skills under the tutelage of dealmakers
such as Mr Michael Ashcroft of ADT and Mr Tony Millar of Albert Fisher, the
fruit distributor and processor.
It is perhaps his employment history, and the similar patterns of rapid
growth by acquisition, which have contributed to uncertainty about
Hartstone. Rumours about trouble bedding down the two European hosiery
companies acquired in January and black holes in its US leathergoods
operation were among several which gave the share price a rough ride last
month.
The price has since more than recovered to finish last night 5p up at 279p,
while the company dismisses the speculation as completely false.
Nevertheless, analysts say the uncertainty reflected in the volatile share
price is something which must be addressed in this week's results. 'It is
what's going on underneath (at Hartstone) that is difficult to establish,'
said Mr Alistair Irvine of Smith New Court. 'They will have to make sure the
numbers are totally clean, so no-one can come back to ask what's going on.'
The difficulty lies in Hart-stone's rapid transition via three rights issues
and more than 20 acquisitions from a dull UK hosiery company called Glamar
to Europe's third-biggest hosiery group and the world's largest distributor
of leather goods.
The UK hosiery and leathergoods side, last year the largest of its
businesses by far, now represents 25 per cent of sales.
The purchase of Aznar, Spain's second largest hosiery company, and Cogetex,
number two in France, propelled Hartstone into the European big league. Mr
Robert Stockfis, an independent analyst with the Metropolitan Optima
publication, is forecasting that these two companies will have contributed
about Pounds 16m in turnover and Pounds 1.5m in profits for just two months
of 1991-92.
The logic of combining the Spanish and French companies under one roof is
such that the original management might be forgiven a twinge of regret upon
hearing that Hartstone had negotiated the agreements simultaneously and, not
surprisingly, in secret.
'Had we known, Hartstone would not be here now,' said Mr Michel Urbain,
managing director of Cogetex.
In the five months since Hartstone moved in, 20 per cent of Cogetex's
finished output has been transferred to Aznar's under-utilised,
state-of-the-art factory in Valencia. The Spanish company is supplying 15
per cent of Cogetex's yarn needs, and 20 per cent of the materials for the
UK hosiery operation.
Aznar has also introduced Cogetex's Well brand to all leading Spanish
supermarkets, as part of Hartstone's drive to create a pan-European brand of
tights.
Furthermore, the acquisitions have given Hartstone the raw materials deals
with manufacturers such as Du Pont, which analysts estimate could save it
more than Pounds 2m in the present year.
The company has been equally astute in its raids on the fragmented
leathergoods market. Most of this operation is in the US, where Michael
Stevens and Etienne Aigner were bought last year.
Growth at Michael Stevens, the handbag and leathergoods supplier, has
outstripped even Mr Barker's high expectations. Sales are expected to reach
Dollars 95m in the year just finished, up from Dollars 45m last time.
Analysts have calculated that the benefits of Michael Stevens' buying power
in the Far East will help the North American leathergoods division, included
for the first time, to contribute profits of more than Pounds 13m.
European leathergoods, although much smaller, will also find some benefits
in Michael Stevens' sourcing powers. Already the US company is selling to
Hartstone's UK companies, such as Lanca.
Analysts expect this division, enlarged by some small acquisitions, to show
sales of about Pounds 44m, up from Pounds 28.5m, and profits of about Pounds
4.8m, compared with Pounds 3.8m.
Mr Barker's integration theory also offers the promise of benefits across
divisions. By the end of the year, he said, the hosiery companies would have
introduced the leathergoods products to continental supermarkets and Aznar
warehouses would be storing leather products.
But such ambitious plans are a long way away from what company watchers will
want to know next week. If Hartstone is to make the psychological transition
from small company to large - and quell some of the market uncertainties -
it will have to convince fund managers and analysts who have had their
fingers burnt by the likes of Albert Fisher.
That means that several longer-term questions will have to be answered. For
instance, what happens to an acquisitive company's growth record when new
accounting practices begin to hit earnings through above-the-line costs?
More importantly, after rationalisation and reorganisation, how much more
growth can be extracted from a mature market such as hosiery? Finally, will
there have to be a third leg to maintain growth, and if so, what?
Mr Barker makes no secret of his ambition to move into lingerie.
Conveniently, Hartstone has taken an option to buy Aznar's lingerie arm,
Aznar Industrial. However, European lingerie,dominated by well-established
names such as Cacharel, may prove a more difficult market.

FT  12 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Rumours of Sorrell's departure denied -
Refinancing appears to offer best hope for WPP
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARY MEAD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE IDEA that WPP's banks are seeking the removal of Mr Martin Sorrell,
chief executive, as part of the price for agreeing a new financing package
for the Dollars 1bn-indebted international marketing services group, was
roundly denied yesterday
Mr Paul Judge, a recently-appointed non-executive member of WPP's board and
chairman of Food From Britain, the British trade support body, said
yesterday: 'I have heard no suggestion from the banks that Mr Sorrell should
change his role.'
He added that the role of chairman and chief executive would not be merged,
though it was becoming increasingly likely that Mr David Ogilvy, WPP
chairman, now 81, would probably retire soon.
Mr Rupert Faure Walker of Samuel Montagu, WPP's advisers in its bank
negotiations, said: 'I have seen only total support for Mr Sorrell, both
among the banks and within the operating companies. There is no intention of
any of the banks to see a change of chief executive.'
On Friday evening WPP announced that the co-ordinating committee - Bankers'
Trust, Barclays, Citibank and JP Morgan - of its 28 member banking
syndicate, had agreed in principle to a rights issue, the proceeds of which
would be used to reduce the group's debt.
Under the terms of the proposal, which must now be put to the syndicate and
existing shareholders, the banks could end up owning slightly more than 50
per cent of the group's equity. The Dollars 1bn debt could be reduced by as
much as 25 per cent.
The latest re-financing package follows a Dollars 1bn (Pounds 558m)
restructuring package completed in April 1991, which saw WPP incurring a
'success fee' of slightly more than Pounds 10m payable to its banks. The
latest package will cost the company a similar amount.
WPP has to repay or refinance Dollars 400m of its debt by June 1993 and
repay the remaining Dollars 604m four years later. It is unable to offer any
dividend payments at least until June 1993.
By coming up with a new measure to keep WPP going, the banks appear to have
decided that other options, such as forcing disposals, would not have
produced attractive returns.
In March WPP stated its intention to sell Scali McCabe Sloves, a US agency,
as well as some market research subsidiaries. Mr Sorrell said at the time he
hoped to raise some Dollars 200m. However, buyers have so far failed to
materialise.
The rumour that Mr Sorrell might be forced to leave or switch roles had
gained ground in the last couple of weeks. Mr Sorrell declined to comment on
his position yesterday.
A banker involved in the negotiations said yesterday: 'Each of the 28 banks
in the syndicate have some 10 people involved in the negotiations at some
level. It is not surprising that some of that group look at WPP, see it as a
problem on their books and want to find a single individual to blame.
'But those private views do not represent the thinking of the most senior
figures in each of the banks involved.'
Analysts took the view that the removal of Mr Sorrell would not be sought by
the banks at this stage, if at all. But some argued that WPP's board needs a
new senior executive presence to act as a counter-weight to him.
Analysts also believed that there was a good chance of the rights proposal
being backed by the banking syndicate. Mr Richard Dale of Smith New Court
said: 'The steering committee will not have gone this far without feeling
there is a good chance of it going through with the rest of the banks.'
If the new proposal does get the full syndicate backing, then it is unlikely
that shareholders will resist it. By the end of June, Mr Sorrell and WPP
will probably have bought more breathing space. However, given that most
estimates for increased advertising spending are still very low - perhaps an
increase of 2 per cent throughout the world this year - WPP may still have
to cut costs further, before the drama is played out.

FT  12 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Receivership for Betta Stores
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN THORNHILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BETTA STORES, the privately-owned Hampshire-based grocery chain, has gone
into receivership just two years after it was formed through the purchase of
51 stores from Budgens. About 850 jobs are at risk.
The company, which currently runs 47 neighbourhood stores in southern
England, said there was a 'combination of reasons' for its collapse but
blamed the recession as the biggest contributory factor.
In March 1990, Betta Stores, headed by Mr Tony Sanderson, a former chief
executive of Circle K, paid Budgens Pounds 10.5m in cash and Pounds 2m in
stock in consideration for the stores. But Budgens provided a secured
subordinated Pounds 2m loan to Betta Stores - repayable by 1994 - and struck
a two-year supply deal with the company.

Bank

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BIFU, the banking union, yesterday welcomed indications from Hongkong and
Shanghai Banking Corporation that most jobs would be safe if it acquired
Midland Bank. In a letter to Mr Leif Mills, Bifu general secretary, Hongkong
Bank said its primary reason for the acquisition was growth rather than cost
cutting
Bifu opposes the rival bid from Lloyds Bank on the grounds that 30,000 jobs
would be shed after the takeover and 1,100 branches would close.
The letter adds: 'It is not our intention to supplant Midland management.'
It says the two banks do not offer overlapping services and confirms Midland
would retain its name and identity.
Mr Mills, speaking to the union's annual conference in Bournemouth, said:
'This confirms the continued existence of Midland Bank and gives reassurance
to staff.'
Many delegates from Lloyds and Midland spoke in support of an emergency
motion condemning Lloyds' bid. Delegates expressed fear of victimisation of
those who spoke out and said morale among staff in both banks was low.
They agreed to oppose a Lloyds takeover by any means possible and said
workers in Lloyds and Midland should be balloted if they wanted to take
industrial action.
Mr Mills has agreed to attend top level meetings at both Hongkong Bank and
Lloyds this Thursday.

FT  12 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Sidlaw advances 41% to Pounds 4.6m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES IN Sidlaw outperformed the market yesterday with a 6 per cent rise to
296p as the oil services, packaging and textiles combine revealed interim
profits 41 per cent ahead at Pounds 4.6m and a 14 per cent increase in the
dividend.
Mr Digby Morrow, chief executive, said the profits increase reflected the
success of attempts to 'carefully position' the group. Sidlaw expanded into
packaging three years ago to offset the more cyclical oil and textiles
sectors.
Turnover rose from Pounds 40.6m to Pounds 45m for the six months to March
31. The interim dividend is raised to 3.75p (3.3p), payable from earnings 34
per cent higher at 9.5p.
The packaging division lead the way, with operating profits Pounds 700,000
higher at Pounds 2m, on sales 18 per cent higher at Pounds 18m. A two point
rise in margins to 11 per cent and the inclusion for six months of Venus,
the flexible packaging company acquired last year, was behind the increase
in profits.
Mr Morrow said the group intended to invest heavily in capital equipment.
Some Pounds 3m was budgeted for packaging expenditure in the next 12 months.
Oil services, where Sidlaw provides warehousing, manpower and management
skills to the North Sea oil industry, enjoyed a Pounds 400,000 rise in
profits to Pounds 2.7m .
The benefits of the joint venture with the Dutch Smit group - which aims to
provide supply chain management to on- and off-shore oil producers
internationally - would not make a significant contribution for about three
years, he said. The venture, announced in March, is expected to cost Sidlaw
an initial Pounds 500,000.
Textiles increased margins and profits in a difficult environment. The
operating return increased from Pounds 400,000 to Pounds 500,000.
Gearing fell from 26 per cent at the year-end to 21 per cent. Mr Ian Bodie,
finance director, said this was expected to fall to less than 20 per cent
and possibly as low as 15 per cent by the year-end.

FT  12 MAY 92 / BTR sells its 4.1% stake in Pilkington
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BTR, the industrial conglom- erate, yesterday sold its 4.1 per cent stake in
Pilkington, the UK glass maker, formally marking an end to its takeover
hopes which began with its contentious and unsuccessful Pounds 1.16bn bid in
November 1986.
Stockbrokers Barclays de Zoete Wedd offered to buy BTR's Pilkington stake.
The 31m shares were sold in a bought deal, where prices are pre-arranged, at
161p a share. BZW yesterday sold just over half of its Pilkington holding
for 162 1/2 a share. BTR's shares rose 3p to close at 493p while
Pilkington's shares fell 4p to close at 160p.
Following its unsuccessful bid, BTR went on to increase its Pilkington
holding in 1987 and 1990. However, since it acquired Hawker Siddeley, the
British engineering group in a Pounds 1.55bn takeover last November, it lost
interest in using its Pilkington holding as a platform for a bid.
The deal is worth around Pounds 50m. BTR will make a small above-the-line
profit which will help reduce gearing.
BTR's sale is the latest in a long line of bought deals. Hanson last week
sold its 2.8 per cent shareholding in Imperial Chemical Industries to
Goldman Sachs.
A financier with a close knowledge of BTR said Mr Alan Jackson, chief
executive, did not believe in holding shares purely for investment. Mr
Jackson, an Australian, earned a reputation as a formidable dealmaker during
a long stint at the head of BTR Nylex, the group's antipodean offshoot.
The financier said: 'Mr Jackson's skill lies in deal making not stock market
gambling. Once BTR decided that the group would definitely not bid for
Pilkington a decision was made to sell the shares.'
Pilkington, which makes glass for both the construction and automotive
industries, has suffered badly in the recession in the UK and North America
with profits down from Pounds 314.3m to Pounds 151.6m in the 1990-91 year.
In the past two years Pilkington has been reviewing all its operations and
has sold a number of peripheral activities which were not performing.
Last month it appointed Mr Roger Leverton as group chief executive,
replacing Mr Derek Cook, group managing director and deputy chairman, who
will retire in June.

FT  12 MAY 92 / Bass finds running hotels is no holiday: British steps to
improve the quality of a US product
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The problems of running a predominantly franchised hotel chain through a US
recession, with falling property values and a credit crunch, are proving
less than a holiday for Bass, the UK hotel, brewer and leisure group.
Since it acquired the Holiday Inn brand in the US in a complex deal in
August 1989, Bass has seen a dip in operating profits from its hotel
division, become embroiled in a law suit, faced a ferocious competitive
environment and struggled to persuade some franchisees to upgrade
properties.
Nevertheless, the British owners, who have taken some firm steps in an
attempt to cure Holiday Inn's problems, remain remarkably bullish. And,
although it is probably too soon to judge whether such optimism is
well-placed, the recent surge in the Bass share price, ahead of next week's
interims, suggests certain followers are optimistic.
When Bass, which already owned Holiday Inns outside the US, acquired the
brand in the US, it was displayed on almost 1,400 properties, mostly run by
franchisees.
The consideration was almost Dollars 2bn (Pounds 1.1bn), largely comprising
the assumption of Holiday debt. Holiday's sister chain, Hampton Inn, along
with the Harrah casinos and some other assets, were spun off to the group's
former management, creating a new company called Promus.
Bass's total operating profits from the hotel division slipped to Pounds
103m in the 12 months to mid-1991, of which the US properties were reckoned
to contribute between two-thirds and three-quarters - a paltry return, given
the outlay. In London the Bass share price remained in the 460p-520p range
throughout 1991.
Even in the current year, with the US economy improving, it has not been
plain sailing. A share price rally was temporarily reversed following news
of a lawsuit by Bass against Promus in February. This alleged
misrepresentations by Promus at the time of the Holiday deal; breached
warranties; and failure to adhere to a tax-sharing contract.
The US suit is thin on detail and both parties have declined to comment  -
although Bass tends to downplay the action, suggesting it is designed to
keep all options open.
However, the complaints which can be gleaned from the documents are scarcely
encouraging.
They include Promus's alleged failure to notify Bass about a Federal Trade
Commission investigation into a now-discontinued Holiday subsidiary; the
supposed refusal to execute an agreement which would have 'cured' a default
on a San Francisco Holiday Inn; Holiday's compliance with federal
regulations covering underground fuel storage tanks; and Promus's alleged
failure to make adequate provision for bad debts on a Dollars 50m loan by
Holiday to VMS, owner of 24 hotels operated under the Holiday name.
So what has been going on with the world's largest hotel brand, during
around two years of British ownership?
Holiday Inn was created 40 years ago by Mr Kemmons Wilson, a Memphis-based
property man. Infuriated by the service he received at motels, he devised a
formula designed to meet the requirements of travellers better. The first
Holiday Inn opened outside Memphis in 1952.
By the 1970s, the chain had expanded, and the company began to concentrate
on overseas growth. But management changed and the focus shifted to
activities such as gaming.
Then, in the credit-easy 1980s, a wave of hotel building splintered the
market, with growth focused on luxury hotels at one end and economy motels
at the other. Holiday's management built up the Hampton Inn chain in
response and introduced the up-market Crowne Plaza line, but its core
middle-market Holiday Inns seemed to languish. When ownership changed,
Holiday Inn was not the best nurtured of brands.
The UK owner has taken action on two fronts.
The first centres on costs, and a streamlining of activities. Bass has
sliced off some non-core businesses, for example, such as the manufacturing
section of the Holiday Services division.
It has also overhauled the service facilities for franchisees, replacing
regional staff with a head office service department; rewritten the bulky
franchise manual; and closed down the Holiday Inn 'university' in favour of
training instructors who visit the properties. When Bass acquired the US
brand 2,400 people were employed at its headquarters in Memphis. Bass
shifted Holiday Inn's headquarters to Atlanta where just over 1,000 are now
employed.
But this still leaves the toughest area, and one which worries investors
most: quality standards. Bass says when it took over Holiday Inn's
properties '80 per cent were in very reasonable condition', meaning several
hundred were sub-standard.
A fairly tough battle seems to have ensued to persuade franchisees to
upgrade their properties. More than 90 properties have dropped out of the
Holiday Inn system since March 1990, although new franchisee signings,
notably for a replacement downmarket chain under the 'Holiday Express'
title, have also taken place.
Meanwhile, the competitive environment has been ferocious.
The US recession coupled with the Gulf war left the country's lodging market
awash with rooms. For example, Ramada, another middle-market hotel chain,
launched a tough advertising campaign under the 'Ramada's in, Holiday's out'
theme, earlier this year. 'Laughable', retorts Holiday, noting that some of
its less prestigious properties are now run under the Ramada banner.
Nevertheless, the British owners are optimistic. They claim the quality
problem is slowly righting itself. 'It's an ongoing problem but it is being
solved,' says Mr Bryan Langton, chairman of Holiday Inn Worldwide.
Holiday, which has traditionally enjoyed higher-than-average room rates and
occupancy levels, also claims it increased this premium against
middle-market competitors in 1991, in spite of the soft underlying market
and competitive conditions.
Some franchisees are supportive: 'Bass is raising the standard and there's
good open communication,' says one. 'If there's a negative, it's that a lot
of people have left who knew the brand.'
But competition in the US lodging market is still intense and even Bass
admits it may take longer to change US consumers' perceptions of the chain.
Perhaps the most encouraging sign is that Holiday is ploughing ahead with
plans to raise franchise fees. Traditionally, Holiday Inn franchisees have
paid more than 4 per cent of room revenues to the brand owner. Since
February, Holiday has insisted on 5 per cent for all new franchisees.
It has also begun to offer existing franchisees, whose contracts come up for
renewal, another two years at the 4 per cent rate, and then a switch on to 5
per cent.
The advantage for Holiday, says Mr Langton, is that about 40 per cent of
franchisee contracts fall due during the next five years.

FT  12 MAY 92 / Lloyds likely to win round in battle over Midland Bank
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MIDLAND BANK is expected to lose the first round of its fight to prevent its
rival, Lloyds, from obtaining access to detailed information on its
finances.
The executive of the Takeover Panel, the City's arbiter of bid tactics, is
likely to rule that Midland should provide Lloyds with financial information
which Midland has already given to Hongkong and Shanghai Banking
Corporation. A decision could be made today.
However, Midland is likely to appeal to the panel's full council, if the
decision goes against it.
The panel's executive is understood to have accepted Lloyds' argument that
it is a 'bona fide potential offeror' under the terms of the takeover code.
If that is the case, then Lloyds has the right to receive information on
Midland which any other bidder for Midland has received.
Hongkong Bank, which has made a formal takeover offer for Midland, has
access to Midland's accounts. It has been a 15 per cent shareholder in
Midland since 1987. It carried out a financial investigation of Midland, a
process known as 'due diligence', before making its bid.
Midland has declined to give the same information to Lloyds. Lloyds has said
it will bid for Midland, subject to two preconditions, but it has not made a
formal offer. Midland is concerned Lloyds will never make a formal offer.
Midland views Lloyds as an arch-rival and fears its business could be
damaged if it gives Lloyds commercially valuable information.
One of the two preconditions to a Lloyds bid is that it should receive all
information on Midland which Hongkong Bank has received since January 1
1992.
The other precondition is that either Lloyds must be satisfied that its
proposed offer will not be referred for scrutiny by the Monopolies and
Mergers Commission, the UK competition authority, or that Hongkong Bank's
bid will be referred if Lloyds' bid is.
The Office of Fair Trading is expected to recommend early next week that
Lloyds' bid should be referred. However, Hongkong Bank's bid is unlikely to
be referred to the MMC.
Mr Michael Heseltine, president of the Board of Trade, has to decide whether
to follow the OFT's advice. If he does, Lloyds may drop the MMC
precondition.
Lloyds is convinced that its proposed offer has won considerable support
from Midland's shareholders. It believes these shareholders may be prepared
to wait during the three months of an MMC inquiry before deciding whether to
back a Lloyds bid or Hongkong Bank's offer.

FT  12 MAY 92 / EC recalls ambassadors from Serb-dominated Yugoslavia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE EUROPEAN Community yesterday acted to isolate the new Serb-dominated
state of Yugoslavia by recalling its ambassadors from Belgrade.
As fighting reached a new intensity throughout Bosnia-Hercegovina, the EC
foreign ministers demanded the withdrawal of the Yugoslav federal army from
Bosnia or its disbanding. They called federal forces 'an army of
occupation.'
In a further diplomatic blow, the EC also shut the rump-Yugoslav state out
of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE).
Mr Fred Eckhard, the spokesman for the United Nations peacekeeping forces,
whose headquarters are in the Bosnian capital Sarajevo, said the situation
was close 'to an intolerable level in terms of criminality and anarchy'.
Gunmen had commandered two UN jeeps and had stolen the peacekeepers'
side-arm weapons, he said.
The EC shied away from calling on Bosnian Serbs to desert the federal forces
in Bosnia, but Mr Douglas Hurd, Britain's foreign secretary, said the aim
was for troops to return 'to their barracks or home, without aggressive
equipment'.
Mr Gianni de Michelis, Italy's foreign minister, said the new Yugoslavia,
made up of Serbia and Montenegro, would also be excluded from next week's
ministerial meeting of the Organisation of Economic Co-operation and
Development (OECD), which Yugoslavia has long attended as an observer.
Sarajevo suffered another day of heavy fighting as Federal army troops and
Serb irregulars continued to tighten their grip on the city. Another four
people were killed in the city overnight. At least 1,320 people have been
killed in the past 45 days of fighting over Bosnian independence.
In the south-west of the republic, both forces were poised to take the city
of Mostar.
Fighting between Bosnian Territorial Defence forces and Serb irregulars also
continued around Brcko, Doboj and Modrica, northern Bosnia.
EC officials and UN diplomats stationed in Bosnia appeared increasingly
frustrated about the breakdown of last week's ceasefire. Community monitors
stationed in Ilidza, a district of Sarajevo, watched helplessly as Serb
forces launched rocket attacks about 200 yards from the hotel where monitors
and foreign journalists are staying.
But EC foreign ministers said there was no question of the Community
abandoning its attempt to arrange a political settlement.
Although 'ceasefires are signed and broken,' Mr Hurd said, 'eventually
people will realise they are not going to gain by attacking their
neighbours'.
He said although EC monitors had been pulled out of Bosnia for safety
reasons, they might return to help with humanitarian aid.
Brussels yesterday agreed to give the UN High Commission for Refugees Ecu30m
(Pounds 21m) more out of the EC budget. Mr Hurd said Britain was raising its
contribution to the UN effort from Pounds 2.3m to Pounds 3.3m.
The UN will today launch an appeal to aid some 700,000 refugees from Bosnia.
Ms Judith Kumin, head of the Belgrade branch of the UN High Commission for
Refugees, described the refugee problem caused by the war as 'not only the
greatest refugee problem in Europe since the Second World War but one of the
biggest problems in the world'.

FT  12 MAY 92 / Mandela warns of threat to S African constitution talks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAMBERT
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   JOHANNESBURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE COMBINATION of political violence and Pretoria's efforts to retain a
white veto was 'serious enough to destabilise' South Africa's constitutional
negotiations, Mr Nelson Mandela, the African National Congress president,
warned yesterday.
In an interview with the Financial Times, Mr Mandela repeated his intention
to create a government of national unity should the ANC win a general
election. He reassured white civil servants and invited foreign businessmen
to prepare to invest once an interim government was in place.
But while he said he was not seeking a confrontation at the second round of
constitutional talks that begin on Friday, Mr Mandela made clear his concern
at the wide gap between the ANC and the government.
'It takes more than one person to make a crisis,' he said, responding to
reports of deadlock over efforts to pave the way for an interim government,
the main objective of the forthcoming talks at the Convention for a
Democratic South Africa (Codesa).
'We have no intention of staging any showdowns. We are going there with a
spirit of reconciliation, wanting that something should come out of the
meeting.'
The government had moved its position on some key issues, Mr Mandela noted.
'They were against the idea of an interim government, and a constituent
assembly to draw up a new constitution - now they've accepted it.' But he
went on to accuse Mr de Klerk of 'clinging to the levers of power'.
The ANC envisaged a bill of rights, a national assembly elected on the basis
of proportional representation under a multi-party constitution that
required a two-thirds majority for any fundamental change.
'We are very concerned that the first government should be seen to represent
everybody, and should inspire confidence among all groups in the country,'
Mr Mandela said. 'But what we are not prepared to do is to give a minority
of less than 15 per cent of the population the right to veto decisions of
the majority . . . that is what Mr de Klerk wants, and that we cannot
accept.'
Political violence was an attempt 'to destabilise the ANC', he said. 'It
seems clear to us that the idea is to prevent (the election of) a democratic
government dominated by the ANC.'
Mr Mandela said of the Codesa talks that 'problems have arisen, some serious
enough to destabilise the discussions'.
'For one reason or other, government was not acting' to curb the violence
that has left 13,000 dead in the past four years.
Government insistence on a white veto and the continuing political killings
were 'two issues that threaten the whole negotiating process', he said. 'But
we are determined that the process should proceed, and that is why we have
demanded immediate installation of an interim government' which would become
responsible for security.
Asked about plans to reform the white-dominated civil service, Mr Mandela
said: 'We do not intend to throw people on to the streets. We do need to
democratise the civil service, but it will be done in a humane manner.'

FT  12 MAY 92 / Kohl plea for German wage restraint
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR HELMUT KOHL, the German chancellor, yesterday rejected any attempt to
link new private sector pay deals to last week's public sector award of 5.4
per cent, and called for restraint in wage claims and public spending.
In an urgent appeal to employers and trade unions, he threw his weight
behind the austerity programme of Mr Theo Waigel, finance minister,
promising savings across the board in the federal budget, but no tax
increases.
At the same time, he warned that the rapidly rising wages in east Germany
were undermining private investment flows and preventing the gradual
equalisation of living standards between the two halves of the country.
His appeal was launched at a combined meeting of employers, trade unions and
the leaders of the 16 German states to discuss the continuing plight of the
east German economy and the financial pressures on both public and private
sectors.
It comes at a moment when further strikes are threatened in the engineering
and construction industries, as well as by print workers, in the wake of
last week's pay deal for almost 3m public sector workers.
It also coincides with crumbling popularity for his ruling coalition and
widespread scepticism about the promised austerity programme in the light of
the public sector award.
'This agreement was a very hard decision for us to take,' Mr Kohl said.
'Both for the whole economy and for public spending it contains incalculable
risks.'
Yet the government was forced to go 'beyond the limit' because of an
arbitration award of 5.4 per cent, which aroused 'exaggerated expectations'.
Mr Kohl also blamed unnamed state premiers and city mayors, who 'stabbed the
negotiators in the back' by recommending a deal at the last moment. He
rejected any attempt to link the deal with the private sector pay talks
under way.
'There can be no pay leadership of the public service for the private
sector,' he said. 'Every sector must reach a wage agreement which is
bearable in relation both to the challenges of German unity and growing
international competition.'
He warned that east Germany was falling behind, with private sector
investment per capita running at only two-thirds of the level in west
Germany. Wages and salaries had reached 44 per cent of the western level in
1991, while productivity was only 29 per cent.
The chancellor's appeal was met by stern resistance from the DGB, the trade
union federation, whose leader, Mr Heinz-Werner Meyer, rejected any plea for
a 'change of course' in wage talks. He also warned against any attempt to
put the brunt of public sector spending cuts on programmes for retraining
and cushioning the impact of eastern unemployment.
The one positive sign for Mr Kohl yesterday was the agreement by the
opposition Social Democrats (SPD) to take part in cross-party talks on the
growing economic crisis on May 27.
The federal budget this year is likely to have a net borrowing requirement
of DM45bn (Pounds 15.3bn), and there is widespread scepticism that the
government can reduce that to the planned DM25bn by 1995 without
supplementary taxes, or without drastic cuts in social spending - both still
ruled out by Mr Kohl.

The prime minister's bid for more open government clearly has some way to go
when it comes to arms sales. Last year John Major strongly backed plans for
a UN register on which all significant exports of weapons would be declared.
But the Ministry of Defence was not keen to advertise last Friday's arrival
of its big-spending guest Mohammed Najib Tun Abdul Razak, Malaysia's defence
minister. His country has bought more than Pounds 1bn of British arms in the
past three years and hasn't finished spending. Having been spirited off to a
helicopter show in Middle Wallop, the visitor and his plans to meet
ministers and industry had to be acknowledged - albeit 12 hours later.
Memo to Britain's top brass: to keep such visits secret, urge the customer
not to arrive on the same flight from Jakarta as the Duchess of York.

It is not quite the 'gaffe' Berlusconi's news magazine Panorama proclaims it

plenty of PCs. But coming just before today's likely announcement of a

The more mischievous among Conservative MPs were speculating that the Queen
may have decided to settle an old score with Margaret Thatcher when she
speaks to the European Parliament in Strasbourg today.
During her time in Downing Street, Thatcher consistently refused to sanction
a royal visit to an institution whose federalist ideals she abhorred. Now
the Queen is planning to tell the MEPs that her government sees Strasbourg
winning an ever more important role in fulfilling the European ideal.
Most wounding for the former prime minister, an original draft of the
Queen's address - the subject of sharp differences at Westminster last night
 -argued that differences in national parliamentary tradition were
insignificant against a European-wide commitment to democracy.
At that, Thatcher, already planning to deliver another onslaught on
Federalism in the Hague on Friday, was expected, in the words of one Tory
MP, to 'go nuclear'.

But the wearing of shorts is unlikely to mean an increase in dog bites. Says

FT  12 MAY 92 / Observer: Gorby's Red Star special
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Karl Marx must be spinning in his tomb. Not only has Mikhail Gorbachev -
together with the glamorous Raisa - taken to riding across America's skies
on Forbes Magazine's well-appointed 'Capitalist Tool' jet, but last night he
was guest of honour at Forbes' 75th birthday celebration at New York's Radio
City Music Hall. Is there nothing the world's favourite ex-Soviet president
won't do for publicity?
Taking a cue from his old friend Ronald Reagan, Gorbachev is cashing in on
his reputation now that he is free from the cares of office. Last week 500
guests paid Dollars 5,000 each to attend a Reagan Library lunch for Mr G.
Then, in San Francisco, another 4,000 local fans paid Dollars 40 a ticket to
hear a Gorbachev speech. This week's lecture on anti-Semitism at Yeshiva
University, a Jewish college, is expected to raise another Dollars 1m for
the Gorbachev Foundation. In between times he will visit the New York Stock
Exchange and break bread with Henry Kissinger.
Yet nothing is as surreal as the flirtation between Gorby and the eccentric
Forbes Magazine. Last night he joined Ronnie at Forbes' mogul-studded Radio
City event, with 3,000 guests ranging from First Boston's Jack Hennessy to
clothes designer Ralph Lauren. Maggie Thatcher was invited to the Forbes
bash, but sadly couldn't make it.
Forbes is reluctant to explain the terms on which Gorbachev borrowed its
jet, but it sounds as if it was a quid pro quo for his appearance at the
Radio City bash. Whatever the terms, Malcolm S Forbes junior, 44, seems to
be trying to live up to his father's hell-raising reputation. But somehow he
doesn't seem to have quite the same sort of pizazz.

FT  12 MAY 92 / US retailer all over the shop / Examining mounting criticism
of Sears Roebuck
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT and BARBARA DURR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ed Brennan, a third-generation employee at Sears Roebuck who rose from the
shop floor to become its chairman, sits in Chicago's 110-storey Sears Tower
and ponders a question about capital expenditure. The carpet is thick, the
view magnificent, and Mr Brennan does not appear to know the answer.
An adviser interjects. The required figure will be disclosed in the retail
and financial services group's annual report. Perhaps he could search it out
and communicate later? Mr Brennan, mollified, delivers a homily on the
dangers of statistics.
By chance, an identical conversation arose weeks earlier. The setting was
the spartan headquarters of Wal-Mart, an aggressive discount chain which
recently ousted Sears as America's top-selling retailer. Don Soderquist,
Wal-Mart's chief operating officer, had nipped into a neighbouring office,
cornered the finance director, and extracted the answer. It took two minutes
and there was no minder in sight.
The comparison may seem trivial but it epitomises much of the criticism
surrounding Sears. Struggle as the 106-year-old behemoth may to cut costs
and streamline operations, it is still dogged by inefficiency and
overmanning. The antique furniture does not shift easily and the
paternalistic attitudes of top corporate officers seem equally fixed.
'The central issue is culture,' says Edward Weller, retail industry observer
at Montgomery Securities, a San Francisco broker. 'Sears was so caught up in
its post-war success that when the world passed it by in the 1970s, the
company didn't know it.'
Criticism of Sears has been mounting over the past five years, since its
peak profits after tax of Dollars 1.63bn in 1987. The company - which
employs more people than any US corporation except General Motors  - has
been on a slide since then, making less money last year than in 1983. Its
share price has oscillated around the Dollars 40 mark for four years after a
high of Dollars 59.5 in 1987. Not surprisingly, investors are unhappy; some
have complained vociferously. At its annual general meeting on Thursday,
five separate 'dissident' motions are on the agenda. Mr Brennan knows there
will be trouble.
Already some of his opponents have spoken out publicly. These include the
California Public Employees Retirement System (Calpers), one of the biggest
institutional investors in the US; some of the sales agents for Allstate,
Sears' large insurance subsidiary; and Robert Monks, a professional
shareholder activist, who tried to win a board seat at Sears 12 months ago.
Battle lines have been drawn. On one side, Mr Brennan will be challenged by
his critics to field an adequate 'industrial' defence in terms of improved
operating performance and to outline strategies to recoup lost territory. On
the other, the dissidents will be trying to take advantage of the changing
climate of US corporate governance to give shareholders greater influence on
the company through independent board directors.
Against this background of declining performance and mounting
disenchantment, Sears' problems should be put in perspective. Having started
out as a catalogue operation in the 1880s, it had come to symbolise
'mainstream America' by the mid-1950s and by the 1960s was able to state
bluntly: 'We are not a store for the whimsical or affluent . . . We are not
a store which anticipates . . . We reflect the world of Middle America.'
The roaring Eighties, followed by the recession-hit Nineties, have presented
two distinct challenges. First, after a sharp rise in consumer spending and
expansion in US retail space, Sears turned to consumer-based financial
services. In 1981, at a cost of Dollars 800m, it added the Dean Witter
Reynolds investment banking firm and Coldwell Banker property services to
Allstate, the large composite insurer it already owned. 'Stocks 'n' Socks',
muttered Wall Street rather derisively.
In its zest to become all things to all men, Sears overlooked the trend of
the US retail market. Specialty retailers, or 'category killers', started
coming into their own in the late 1980s and stealing business from
department stores. Toys 'R' Us is probably the best-known example in the UK
 -but in electronics, the pattern was repeated by Circuit City, in fashion
by the likes of Nordstrom.
More recently, a second trend has emerged. Discount retailers, led by
Wal-Mart, and the warehouse clubs (out-of-town barns, selling at rock-bottom
prices to a membership customer base) are making the running. 'Value' has
become the buzzword: quality, branded goods at the lowest price.
On both scores, Sears has been slow to respond. At the end of the 1980s, it
introduced 'power formating', dividing the business into seven areas:
appliances and electronics, home improvement, automotive, home furnishings,
women's fashions, children clothing and men's apparel.
Each was to have its own distinctive space and image within the overall
store. In the case of electronics, for example, Sears effectively developed
an in-house boutique, Brand Central, and broke with tradition by introducing
rival name brands alongside its own strong Kenmore appliance brand.
On the price front, Sears actually closed its doors for two days in 1989 to
adjust prices across the board. Amid much fanfare, it re-opened and declared
its commitment to a policy of 'everyday low pricing'.
But such catch-up moves did not address the retailer's deep-seated flaws. A
far more fundamental change was needed if Sears was to match its rivals. In
1989, Sears' expenses accounted for 30 cents in every dollar of sales; at
Kmart, the figure was 23 cents, and at Wal-Mart, 16 cents.
Worse, Sears' bureaucracy, especially on the merchandising side, was
cumbersome. There was, for example, one raft of head office buyers, with
marketing staff who talked to the stores; store managers who took
responsibility for the profits of their properties, and who picked what they
wanted from the buyers' lists; and then regional store managers who had
responsibility over the store managers, and their own marketing operations.
Inevitably, suppliers would find the head office buyers and regional
managers at odds, and the supply chain would stagnate.
Shifting this juggernaut's course has not been quick or easy. On one hand,
Mr Brennan says 275 stores out of 860 'will essentially have the ingredients
of the power format by the end of 1992'. (This could mean a full-scale
revamp or a more superficial division of existing floor-space). When asked
about the pace of further change, he prefers to stress spin-off
merchandising benefits over hard numbers relating to the group's
performance.
The cost picture is no clearer. More than 40,000 jobs have been axed since
Mr Brennan resumed direct responsibility for the retail division in August
1990, including those of the regional managers. But Sears' competitors still
have an average five-point cost advantage. 'Their expenses (are) running at
about 23 cents on the dollar while ours are at 28 cents,' Mr Brennan
acknowledged. (The 1991 figure stood at 29.2 cents for Sears).
This disparity prompted Sears to commission a 'benchmarking' study - in
essence, a detailed comparison with other retailers' organisational
structures, with particular emphasis on staffing and costs.
The results? 'There will be additional jobs to go,' says Mr Brennan. 'It's a
very difficult task to realign a business. In some areas we're at the end of
the job losses.' He refused to discuss numbers.
To date, the earnings figures show little benefit from Mr Brennan's
strategy. After-tax profits fell to a low of Dollars 902m in 1990, before
rebounding to Dollars 1.28bn last year. At first glance, the merchandising
division appeared to mirror this improvement; its profits, Dollars 787m in
1987, advanced from Dollars 257m in 1990 to Dollars 486m in 1991. But within
this figure, domestic retail operations made just Dollars 90m, and Dollars
394m came from the credit business. This, moreover, was on turnover of
Dollars 25bn.
Significantly better figures are expected this year; earnings per share are
forecast to top Dollars 4.50, compared with Dollars 3.71 in 1991. This will
be partly due to cost savings on the retail side; partly to a rebound at
Allstate; and partly to strong figures from Dean Witter.
Before competitors start rubbing their hands in glee on Thursday, they
should pause. Only one alternative strategy has been mooted to pull Sears
out of the mire - spinning off the financial services companies as a
separately quoted stockmarket entity.
In share price terms, a demerger could look attractive. One observer reckons
the retail division and financial services companies, traded separately,
might be worth Dollars 57-Dollars 66 a share (before the allocation of
corporate overheads). Operationally, the advantages are debatable. There is
potential for an increased amount of cross-selling between Allstate and
Sears the merchandiser but at present the two groups only generate a small
percentage of each others' total revenues. The demerger study proposal is
the third preference on a list of five ideas being put forward by dissidents
on Thursday, says Mr Monk, who has contacted 300 institutional shareholders
(see graphic).
The dissidents face one other crucial problem in battling for reform. About
22 per cent of Sears' shares are held by employee profit-sharing plans whose
trustees are appointed by the board. Sears' critics know they have little
chance of securing support from this block. The most they can realistically
expect is a strong protest vote.
That, at least, might send signals to the board which, apart from Mr
Brennan, is composed of non-executives. Mr Monks cites recent ousting by
directors of chairman Robert Stempel as head of the executive board
committee at General Motors as a sign of a changing climate. 'I think the GM
action removes every modicum of a doubt that a board is required to take
responsibility. In the past, it has usually gone along with management.'
Given the record of inaction at Sears, it is possible that nothing will be
done to appease shareholders. The company cannily reduced board numbers from
15 to 10 last year, and the figure is now nine - despite promises to bring
in new blood. These remaining directors may be inclined to give Mr Brennan
the benefit of the doubt until the results of his strategy are clearer.
But the raised voices of the critics will not be silenced if the company
gives any further ground to its competitors. If Sears does not find a way to
reach into the hearts and purses of middle America, Mr Brennan may discover
that magnificent views do not necessarily make magnificent companies.

FT  12 MAY 92 / Leading Article: Better news from America
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
WALL STREET'S reaction to the unexpectedly sharp rise in US payroll
employment on Friday was telling: bond prices fell back in mild shock, but
then recovered, and by the end of the day the yield curve was actually
flatter. In short the US recovery, which is by now well established, still
looks like a very moderate one. This is frustrating to the administration,
which is looking for a political boost, and to the Fed, which had hoped for
a stronger response to its quite aggressive monetary easing; but it suits
the bond market. Growth looks strong enough to support tax revenues, but too
weak to threaten a resurgence of inflation.
It is easy to discount Friday's news: much of the growth was in health;
manufacturing still looks sluggish, with shrinking order books; and in any
case, there was an extra week in the survey period which is not reflected in
any seasonal adjustment. Equally, the strong retail sales shown in recent
store surveys can be put down to the weather, or a politically-motivated
surge in Federal payments which will not recur. Meanwhile, car sales remain
at historically depressed rates even after a modest April rebound.
Positive signs
Easy, then, to cavil; but almost certainly misleading. There are also hidden
positive signs: the household survey of employment, which includes
self-employment, is strongly positive - the strongest, in fact, in any
post-war recovery; and payroll employment outside the growth sectors of
retailing and health care has stabilised despite continued restructuring and
layoffs in defence, finance and parts of the public sector. The private
sector diffusion index - the proportion of all employers expecting to
increase hirings - is now clearly positive.
The puzzle for envious observers on this side of the Atlantic is to see what
is driving any recovery at all. It is true that the Fed has responded, too
slowly for some critics but far more strongly than any European central
bank, to signs of self-imposed credit restraint. However, the figures for
broad money and credit show no response - indeed, the growth of M2 fell
through the bottom of the Fed's target range at its last reading. Strong
personal income growth has not been enough to offset weak employment and
weaker confidence in the UK; yet spending rises in the US despite the fact
that real wage rates have hardly risen in a decade. Exports have accounted
for well over half of US growth since the dollar was driven headlong from
its 1985 peak, but most US export markets are now themselves depressed.
Reviving confidence
The first answer is that US domestic growth and employment growth are the
two sides of a similar coin. The labour force is still growing, though less
rapidly than in recent decades, strongly supported by immigration. This
helps to explain low real income growth, low inflation and low personal
savings rates; but it promises that reviving confidence in the jobs market -
and confidence is reviving, according to recent surveys - will attract more
participants. This is an economy without an effective labour constraint.
This casts an odd light on the Europhobia which faces well-qualified
would-be immigrants to most EC countries.
A second answer is that US export growth is standing up well to sluggish
demand in the outside world. This reflects not only an under-valued exchange
rate - an example which cannot, by definition, be followed by everyone - but
an open-minded trade policy. While the project for a North American Free
Trade Area seems beset by snags, it has given the signal for dynamic growth.
US exports to its economically tiny but potentially huge neighbour Mexico
have been growing as fast as those to the entire EC. Contrast, again, the
grudging response to the desperate trade needs of the former Warsaw Pact
economies.
It is ironic that these modest and sensible successes have been achieved at
a time when American political self-doubt has never been stronger, when
populists denounce the loss of jobs to Latin America, and minorities in US
cities explode in mutual hate. But if returning economic success soothes
these social problems, European economic leaders should be asking, between
shouting-matches on trade, what they can learn from the US.

FT  12 MAY 92 / Leading Article: The fight for EC finances
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN MR Jacques Delors spelled out plans in February for a one-third
increase in European Community revenues during the next five years, the EC
Commission president knew that he was advancing into difficult terrain. The
hostile response from the richer EC countries has shown that this campaign
will be uphill all the way.
Placing the EC's budget on to a new footing to meet the challenges of a
Community which is becoming both wider and deeper is of crucial importance.
The EC must, however, draw up a far more coherent list of spending
priorities for coming years, ensuring that its ambitions for an enlarged
union do not run beyond its capacity to finance those actions and
responsibilities in a sound and sensible way.
Half the extra money which Mr Delors wants to spend by 1997 is targeted on
economic development in the poorer EC countries, Greece, Spain, Portugal and
Ireland. Much smaller additions are earmarked for aid to the former Soviet
Union, eastern Europe and North Africa, as well as for the EC's
infrastructure and industry projects.
The Ecu 21bn extra spending foreseen over five years in the Delors plan will
not break any national budgets. The increase adds up to roughly 0.25 per
cent of the Community's combined gross national product. Mr Delors'
proposals are consistent with the principles underlying the Maastricht
treaty on European union. The EC has, after all, set itself the goal of
moving to a higher plane of integration, crucially through economic and
monetary union.
Most critical
The countries which have most criticised Mr Delors' ideas are those which
are either already - like Germany and Britain - net contributors to the EC
budget, or those which fear, like Italy, that their benefits will be eroded.
Yet if the Community wants to create the political conditions for
irrevocably fixed exchange rates between all members, it will have to accept
the need to pay for it.
It is accepted that preparing for Emu requires convergence of EC economies,
but this process should not be viewed in a rigid way. The EC cannot, for
example, sensibly pursue full income convergence among all member states,
not least because it would send the wrong signals to the former communist
countries of central Europe now queueing up for EC membership in the next
decade. Yet fiscal transfers from stronger to weaker countries will help to
cushion the effect of economic restructuring in the poorer members. Such
restructuring is taking place anyway, but the pressure will probably be
greater under the Emu process. Spain, for instance, is understandably making
support for the Maastricht treaty dependent on greater efforts to finance
economic 'cohesion'.
Greater equity
Any future EC budget arrangements must aim for greater equity in the
provision of resources. The Commission plans to shift the mechanism for
allocating contributions away from the present reliance on value added tax
receipts towards a measure based more on countries' GNP. That is an overdue
move towards more fairness.
Another guiding principle is the need to maintain maximum pressure for
reform of the common agricultural policy. Farm spending was about
three-quarters of the Community budget in 1984-85. It is due to fall next
year to less than half the total. For Mr Delors' overall spending plans to
be credible, these reforms must be intensified.
There are consequences for Britain, too. If the new direction taken by the
Community at Maastricht is to be sustained, Britain will have to help foot
the bill. The UK's Pounds 2bn a year rebate on its Community payments was
negotiated by Mrs Margaret Thatcher in 1984, when the EC's financing
structure and its ambitions looked very different. The UK must accept that
the rebate will probably have to be renegotiated. The German government
again made this point in Brussels yesterday.
Some of the Maastricht signatories may have been under illusions about the
consequences of the commitment to which they agreed. If Mr Delors has
provided the opportunity for a clearer and more rational debate about the
EC's budget strategy, then - not for the first time - he will have set the
Community on the right course.

FT  12 MAY 92 / Arts: A Mass of Life - Brighton Festival
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RONALD CRICHTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Brabant Symphony Orchestra from the Netherlands makes a return visit to
the Festival with three concerts based, surprisingly, on the theme of
Nietzche's prose poem Thus spake Zarathustra. The first, on Saturday
evening, brought the Delius Mass of Life which uses several parts of the
poem. This was a 'Europe Day concert'. By now there will have been a second
programme including the Strauss tone-poem Also sprach Zarathustra; on
Wednesday comes Mahler's Third Symphony of which the fourth movement sets
some famous lines from Zarathustra.
The visiting orchestra and the Brighton Festival Chorus had a guest
conductor, Richard Armstrong. He gave a reading remarkable for clarity and
propulsion. The feeling, not unknown in less assured performances, that
'aged Midday' is falling sleep and that his brother 'aged Midnight' has been
in that state for some time, was successfully avoided. The attack in the
opening number and other double-chorus outbursts, was tonic, the scoring
that looks recklessly clotted and extravagant on paper sounded almost lean -
all the same, the suspicion remains that in this at the time (1905)
fashionably fat and maximalist score there is a thinner one struggling to
get out. The point is worth mentioning, because the apparatus involved
(large choir, huge orchestra) limits the number of performances of a
splendid work many would like to hear more often.
Except in one respect the Brabanters are evidently at home with Delius. The
horns in 'On the mountains' at the beginning of part two were absolutely
secure but they phrased stiffly - the Dutch have cows but not echoing
Norwegian valleys - while the typical woodwind arabesques that should soften
the outlines of some basic rhythmic patterns, though firmly outlined, were
not ideally supple. There was plenty of light and shade: soft choral tone
and soft strings were equally beautiful.
Much of the going in The Mass of Life has to be made by the four soloists.
The baritone alone almost carries the long second half. Here there was some
disappointment. David Wilson-Johnson, a most musicianly and intelligent
singer, was too restrained and self-communing in his meditations and
exhortations (Benjamin Luxon in the EMI/Groves recording is exemplary).
The tenor's part is small by comparison, but it needs firmer projection than
Justin Lavender gave it. Teresa Cahill made sweet sounds in an unknown
tongue. Nietzsche is not for murmuring. The best German came from Yvonne
Minton, whom it was a pleasure to hear again - a pity that Delius gave his
contralto so little to do. Text and translation, in vilely small print, were
included in the programme.

FT  12 MAY 92 / Arts: Cher and kd lang - Pop
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Look on this picture and on this. First we see on stage a woman hiding
ostentatiously behind an image. Wigs that would shame Medusa; a succession
of costumes all apparently raided from a call girl's wardrobe and designed
to show off such indiscretions as posterior tattoos; a set that with its
gnarled tree owes something to gothic comics, and, with its hydraulic lift,
something to an automated warehouse; a repertoire of other people's standard
material sometimes indecipherable beneath the shrill delivery; a band that
covers every song with an unmelodic sludge; background singers experiencing
advanced delirium tremens and dancers doubtless chosen to show off the
slimness of the star's legs.
This was Cher at Wembley last week, vainly attempting to hold back 47 years
with a show that was all posture and no heart.
Now the scene changes to Hammersmith to reveal a demure, androgynous figure,
supported by soberly professional musicians, performing, with a piercingly
affecting voice, her own songs of wistful longing and unrestrained
sensuality, totally at ease in herself and in rapport with her ecstatic
audience.
This was kd lang, the Canadian country singer who has proved too big and
sexually complicated for Nashville to absorb and has now expanded to take
over the world. And yet the two pictures are not in complete contrast.
Cher's status is ambivalent, too. During one of the incessant breaks, when
she hops from thigh-length leather boots into fish-net body-stocking, a
screen unfolds to fill with excerpts from her movies. You realise that they
are all aimed at women. Her act too is littered with the slang of the male
locker room. 'Up Yours', and 'Kiss my ass' she shouts at anonymously
inoffensive members of the audience who rightly doubt the authenticity of
her hair. Cher is the closet feminist.
kd on the other hand is the playful coquette, demurely refusing to admit to
Sapphic tendencies, hiding much behind her irritatingly playful lower case
name. 'Tonight I'm finally going to come out' she teases in a manner far
beyond the sensual capability of Cher. Pause. 'Yes I am a Trini Lopez fan'.
Her sense of humour is as beguiling as her songs, she is still a genuine
entertainer rather than a showbiz money making machine, but the joke is
becoming a bore. Perhaps kd is the closet straight.
Cher was at Wembley, kd lang at the Odeon Hammersmith

FT  12 MAY 92 / Arts: Ice picks are definitely in . . . - Cannes Film
Festival
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIGEL ANDREWS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Does anyone have a good film out there? If so, please bring it to Cannes
instantly. No matter if it is a home movie shot in wobbliest super-8 or if
the only live creature in focus is the cat or if Auntie Flo falling into the
children's playpool is the dramatic high point. It will still be better than
almost anything at the 45th Cannes Film Festival.
You who regard Cannes as a jamboree for hedonistic film critics should be
here right now. With the exception of Robert Altman's spitfire Hollywood
satire The Player - more anon - consider the films we suffer through to earn
our modest dejeuners sur le plage.
From Mexico, opening the Directors Fortnight, came Dana Rotberg's Angel De
Fuego, a muddy-lit circus tale weighed down with ten-ton religious
symbolism. From Canada, opening the Critics Week, came John Pozer's The
Grocer's Wife, a surreal tale of small-town passion after - a long way after
 -Twin Peaks. And from Germany, opening the 'Un Certain Regard' section came
Michael Schottenberg's Averill's Arrival. In this a young man trapped
between train connections finds himself in a nightmare town crowded with
senseless bureaucracy and semaphoric non sequiturs. We would call the film
Kafka-esque if we did not have some respect for Kafka.
Scarcely does the champagne glass touch the lips in Cannes '92 before it is
dashed by the summons to another subtitled torture session. No wonder The
Player, Altman's satirical tilt at Hollywood based on the novel by Michael
Tolkin, was received with near-demented joy. It is a comedy masquerading as
a mystery thriller. Through the story of go-getting studio mogul Griffin
Mill (Tim Robbins) and his killing of a young screenwriter - suspected
author of the poison-pen postcards Mill has been receiving - Altman sends
his own poison-pen postcard to a movie industry that has marginalised him
since his heyday with MASH and Nashville.
Astonishingly, the whole of Tinseltown's front-of-camera division seems to
have signed on for Altman's film. Grateful to bite the corporate hand that
feeds itself from their talent, cameo-playing stars like Cher, Bruce Willis,
Julia Roberts and Burt Reynolds dash in and out of the story with their
mogul-spiting one-liners. Meanwhile Robbins excels as the Baby Face Thalberg
trying to reform the system without actually changing it: the story of
Hollywood's exercise of power through the ages.
The Player opens in Britain soon: more then. Britain's own competition
entries are James Ivory's Howards End and Terence Davies's The Long Day
Closes, both May openers in the UK and both tipped for prizes at Cannes.
Ivory's tour-de-Forster has been a huge hit here already and a buzz is
growing around Davies's portrait of his childhood, sequel to Distant Voices,
Still Lives, which has its official screening this week. I have seen it and
will bet my stamp collection that it wins a major Palm.
But you see the problem? We are looking forward since there is nothing much
to look back to. Even the stars have not electrified the headlines. First
among equals have been Michael Douglas and Sharon Stone who brought Basic
Instinct to Cannes as opening film, with more snores than shockwaves
resulting. The French, especially, could not understand why a simple tale of
passion between a detective with a Versace suit and a blonde with an ice
pick was supposed to scandalise le tout Europe.
It is strange, though, is it not, how movie motifs spread. Ice picks are now
definitely 'in.' A Russian director trying to sell more tickets to his film
described it in his blurb as 'reality with an ice pick to the head.' And in
Hal Hartley's mildly hypnotic Simple Men - the only Competition film within
a mile of The Player and Howards End - a character also talks in passing of
heads and ice picks.
From the maker of Trust here is a simple tale of two brothers looking for
their jail-escaped dad through the crazy boondocks of Long Island. Instead
they find romance and a peculiar wisdom. The dialogue could be by Beckett,
the visuals by Mondrian, the pace by a snail. But at least it is funny and
original; and at least, if not aiming an ice pick at the audience's frozen
brain, the film does suppose that we have brains.
Too little of that at Cannes so far. Jury President Gerard Depardieu has
joined the long line of Cannes jury supremos who instruct their peers to
favour films appealing to the 'heart not the head.' Oh come now. This is a
major European film festival. A little brain food would not be amiss, would
it? We can get heart-warmers any day from TV or Hollywood; or from Cannes
gossip columnists weaving desperate romantic tittle-tattle from a Cote
d'Azur swarming with glittering people not yet doing glittering things.

FT  12 MAY 92 / Arts: Bad Blood - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Griselda Gambaro's play is a hard nut, though flavoursome: you could break a
tooth on it. In effect it is a chamber-sized Jacobean tragedy, but pithier
and more rigorously focused than almost any in the original genre. Again
steely passion replaces sentiment, and Grand Guignol goes hand in hand with
viciously ironic comedy.
In the tiny Gate theatre, Bad Blood exercises a ferocious grip for an hour
and 40 minutes, with no interval - possibly because the pub downstairs is
closed for refurbishing, but anyhow the right decision - and without a
wasted moment.
Beyond the Jacobean frame, it strikes specific modern veins. Not only a
modern-psychological knowingness (which in this Argentinian play never
compromises the passion, as it might in Northern latitudes); but a bleak,
unblinking insight into what becomes of people under an arbitrary tyranny -
both the tyrannised and the tyrant himself. Officially the scene is purely
domestic, a grand house in the 1840s; patently it is a microcosm of a
tyrannical society, though the point is underlined only by the intermittent
rumble of execution-parades outside.
Immune to any challenge, Father is the coldly perceptive, loveless tyrant.
Mother, broken to his will long ago, has learned to notice nothing but what
it is safe to see. Their nubile Dolores has been so hugely indulged - she is
wilful, volatile, extravagant - that she thinks she can get away with
anything; she is wrong about that, which is the story of the play. Father
has carefully chosen as her tutor a young hunchback, poor Rafael, who knows
that he daren't take any chances at all; though Dolores is intended for Juan
Pedro, a thick aristocrat as brutal as her father (if much stupider), she
conceives a burning love for Rafael.
Things move inexorably toward catastrophe. No authorial tenderness is wasted
upon anybody, but they all speak with such savage precision - or pointed
evasions - that their exchanges seethe with embattled character. Marguerite
Feitlowitz's elegant translation knows when to retain the forms of Gambaro's
Spanish cadences, refusing to blur them into more 'natural' English. Equally
the cast, with faultless direction by Kate Rowland, know how to make that a
dramatic asset.
Besides Peter Marinker's monstrous Father (never overplayed) and Marion
Bailey's all-but-extinguished Mother, there is a gloating, ruthless servant
by Kevin O'Donohoe to manage this domestic Hell. Louis Hilyer's prospective
son-in-law is loathsome in every detail.
Young John Padden cuts a memorable figure as Rafael: doe-eyed, pretty and
weighed down by his hump, as prescribed, but quivering with shy Hispanic
pride and wariness. And as Dolores, Alex Kingston captures a wild Latin
spontaneity beyond the range of most Anglo-Saxon actresses; one might think
it a raw natural gift, were her perpetual mood-switches not achieved with
such technical control. She is the most dangerous creature on the stage.
The Gate, Notting Hill, to May 30

FT  12 MAY 92 / Technically Speaking: Legal rights of the copycats
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT IS obvious to personal computer users that Microsoft's 'Windows' program
makes an IBM-compatible personal computer look like an Apple Macintosh.
Why then has a San Francisco judge gutted Apple's copyright suit against
Microsoft by rejecting most of Apple's claims? More important, what impact
will the ongoing legal battle between these two companies have on the rest
of the information technology industry and on computer users?
In 1988, when Apple filed its copyright suit against Microsoft and
Hewlett-Packard (which at the time was touting its NewWave program as an
extension to Windows), industry critics charged that Apple's legal action
might retard advances in computer software by limiting the use of graphical
user interfaces (GUIs).
Implicit in such charges was the acknowledgment that Apple's Macintosh GUI
with its 'icons', pull-down menus and overlapping windows, represented a
significant step forward in making personal computers easier to use.
Four years, three judges and 10m copies of Microsoft Windows later, Apple
has been unable to persuade the courts that the overall 'look and feel' of
its Macintosh software can be protected by copyright.
Instead, the court decided to dissect the Macintosh images and consider
whether each element of the computer screen displays represented 'unique
expression' that was copied by Microsoft, as well as whether that element
was covered by a prior licensing agreement between the two companies.
Thus Apple finds itself arguing that the design of the 'trash can' icon that
represents the function of discarding unwanted data is somehow unique.
This analytical approach to considering copyright claims has been invented
by the courts in an attempt to apply to computer software laws that were
created to protect works of art and written materials.
The precedent was set recently by an appeals court in a little-known case
involving a now defunct software company called Brown Bag, versus Symantec,
best known for its anti-viral programs.
Following the analytical approach recommended by the appeals court, the San
Francisco court surprised all parties in the Apple case by summarily
rejecting most of Apple's claims.
For Microsoft, the rulings represented a big step towards a victory that
will enable the company to continue its drive towards domination of the
personal computer software market. Apple's case is in shreds and the
company's lawyers are pouring over the pieces in search of some way to
reconstruct their arguments.
For other software publishers, the way is now clear to produce programs that
may share the overall appearance of existing products, thereby weakening the
protection that copyright laws offer.
Publishers of the written word may also be given pause for thought.
Following the approach adopted by the US courts, newspaper publishers, for
example, would not be able to protect the design or layout of their pages
which is the 'signature' of a publication.
With programs expected to reach the market later this year that will make it
possible to reproduce the typestyles and layout of any publication quickly
and cheaply on a PC, can it be long before a newsletter, or magazine, or
newspaper finds itself defending the 'look and feel' of its publication
against an imitator?
Microsoft may well prevail in defending Windows against Apple's copyright
claim. In the short term, Apple's loss will be a victory for all of its
competitors in the personal computer market because the reverse decision
would have brought the industry to a grinding halt.
The longer-term implications of the court's rejection of the 'look and feel'
argument should, however, be of concern to all publishers of original works
because computer technology will soon make exact reproduction of everything
from artist's masterpieces to the front page of the Financial Times not only
possible, but probable.

FT  12 MAY 92 / Management (The Growing Business): Why innovation can become
a risky business
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Many owner-managed businesses take unnecessary risks with innovation and new
product development because they do not plan ahead, according to a survey*
by accountants Touche Ross, writes Charles Batchelor.
Only half attempted to assess the commercial feasibility of a new product
before launching it while 60 per cent did not know how much they spent on
innovation. Nearly half did not attempt to protect the rights of their
products.
Nearly half of the companies had a formalised new product development
programme although only 15 per cent had a research and development
department.
Ideas tended to be generated by management and staff with nearly half of all
ideas coming from internal sources.
In spite of this reliance on in-house creativity, only 15 per cent of
companies offered incentives to staff for successful ideas and fewer than
one-in-12 had a suggestion box or a formal suggestion scheme.
Only 16 per cent of companies picked up ideas from competitors or in the
market place, despite the fact that 'me too' products can be cheaper and
less risky to introduce than completely new products.
Three-quarters of respondents held group discussions to identify potential
winners but this made it easy for a director or senior manager to push a
favourite idea in the absence of any quantifiable market knowledge.
Only one-third made use of market research.
About 86 per cent of funding for innovation and product development came
from internal resources, representing a substantial risk for the business.
Sixty per cent of respondents were unable to quantify their spending in this
area while nearly half did not protect their innovations. *Contact Steve

FT  12 MAY 92 / Management (The Growing Business): Crossing the Ts on going
upmarket / A look at moves towards higher quality
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For most of its 150 years, the Churchill group has made fairly utilitarian
tableware. But by the late 1980s, the cheaper end of the china business was
becoming increasingly competitive.
'That part of the market was becoming more price sensitive and margins were
under pressure,' says Stephen Roper, managing director of the Stoke-on-Trent
company, which expects 1992 turnover of Pounds 35m and employs 1,300 people.
The Churchill management, headed by Roper and his two brothers, sat down to
analyse their problems. Their existing customers, mainly chain stores and
mail order companies, wanted better design and more variation.
When the Churchill team looked more closely they found a gap in the market
for standard 20-piece tableware sets between Pounds 19.95 and Pounds 34.95.
They decided to pitch in with a set offering more up-market design features
priced at Pounds 29.95.
After a slow start, the new Chartwell range became popular and is this year
expected to reach sales of Pounds 6m out of domestic tableware sales of
Pounds 25m. Roper calculates that the Chartwell range produces a 15 per cent
return on sales compared with 5 per cent by its cheaper ranges.
The record of British industry for improving quality has not been good. Many
companies have sought, unsuccessfully, to compete on price at the lower end
of the market.
'Increasingly this is a high-wage, high-cost economy. Companies have to add
value to survive,' says Tony Morris, head of strategy and marketing at
accountants Robson Rhodes. But moving up-market can impose considerable
burdens on a business. 'They often lack the appropriate technical and
management skills,' notes Morris. 'They need to improve their quality and
control systems. It often involves a change in management culture.'
Brian Moore, managing director of Thrislington Sales, a manufacturer of
toilet partitions, confirms the scale of the change which a company needs to
undergo in its move up-market. Thrislington started out supplying cheap and
cheerful cubicles to the building trade but now sells specially designed
cubicles to architects. 'We have gone from operating out of a small workshop
to a business with its own product range made under licence around the
world,' says Moore.
The move up-market led to a doubling of the company's margins. It now
employs 50 people and had turnover of Pounds 4m last year. It produces
laminated panels and assembles the cubicles in a 40,000 sq ft factory near
Chester.
The experiences of Churchill and Thrislington show that key elements in a
company moving up-market are:
DESIGN
When Moore started making cubicles, his main selling point was the speed of
delivery - lead times of competitors were typically 16 weeks. But the basic
quality of the cubicles meant they did not appeal to architects specifying
equipment for big construction projects.
Moore decided to call in a professional designer. He asked David Goodwin,
managing director of his own product design consultancy, Goodwin Emck, to
design a more up-market cubicle.
The new cubicle, launched in 1986, won a leading design award and has since
gone on to take a quarter of the market for higher quality cubicles, says
Moore.
Churchill, for its part, beefed up its in-house design department and
introduced new features to its Chartwell range which gave customers the feel
of added value. These included a move to four-colour from two-colour
printing on its tableware, the introduction of a 10-sided plate design,
fluting on cups and bowls and more informative packaging.
MARKETING
Churchill was forced to take a critical look at its markets and it made its
first serious study of pricing and the sort of features which would appeal
to its more mid-market customers. Even so, the launch of the Chartwell range
was a nail-biting time. 'Our trade customers didn't have to buy,' says
Roper. 'They asked what Churchill was doing in the middle range when we had
been at the low end of the market for 100 years.'
Buyers were wooed by providing them with tableware which offered all the
design features, and more, which they would have expected for the price,
says Roper.
Encouraged by the Chartwell launch, Churchill appointed its first full-time
marketing manager, Wendy Morton. Previously a small group of senior people
in the company had selected the tableware patterns they thought would sell.
'We now do much more extensive market research,' says Morton. 'We also
monitor trends in kitchen laminates, wall coverings and paints.'
PRODUCTION
Moving up-market meant Churchill had to make a considerable investment in
the four-colour printing equipment and in a dust press to ease manufacture
of the 10-sided plates. Making a more complicated range slowed down
production. Middle-range customers expect a greater choice of items such as
coffee jugs and sauce boats which require skilled hand-casting compared with
the more mechanised production of plates and cups.
For Thrislington, which had always bought in components for its cubicles,
the impact on production was less marked. But a greater use of nylon and
aluminium components pushed up tooling costs and meant new suppliers had to
be found.
QUALITY
Moving up-market brought both companies into contact with more demanding
customers and they have had to pay close attention to quality. But neither
appears to have made a fundamental change in the way they monitored quality
at the time of their moves up-market.
Only now are both starting to modify their procedures to conform to BS 5750,
the most popular UK quality standard.
But going up-market is not a once-and-for-all process. Both Churchill and
Thrislington are working on new products which will take them further in
this direction. Churchill plans a new, slightly more expensive range.
Thrislington, meanwhile, plans to launch a new design intended to break into
the market currently held by the one-off joiner-made cubicle.

<TEXT>
LABOUR leftwingers are set to exploit the vacuum left by the leadership
election by demanding more freedom to express their differences with the
front bench when MPs meet for the first full parliamentary party meeting
tomorrow.
The growing pressure for a right to express constructive dissent follows
from a widely held belief that Mr Neil Kinnock's regime was too tough in
silencing party loyalists who differed on policy issues.
Members of the 100-strong Tribune group, once designated leftwing but widely
seen as a support group for Mr Kinnock in the final years of his leadership,
are also expected to re-establish their independence. Moves are afoot to
introduce a new rule that would preclude frontbench members from holding
office.
The Campaign Group, depleted in recent years to about 20 members, is also
expecting some recruits from the 60-odd new MPs.
Party leaders are expected to face some criticism at tomorrow's
parliamentary party meeting on the conduct of the general election campaign.

FT  12 MAY 92 / Parliament and Politics: Delay in listing of MPs' interests
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DETAILS of the business interests of MPs in the new parliament may not be
published until the autumn, and even then will not reflect the changes to
the register recently recommended by an all-party committee.
Although MPs are obliged to register their business interests within four
weeks of taking the Westminster oath, they cannot be publicly listed until
approved by the cross-party committee on MPs' interests. That has not yet
been set up.
There is a register of MPs' financial interests as at January this year, but
it omits the 140 new MPs and is increasingly out of date for those MPs it
does feature.
Even the first register of the new parliament will not cover plans for
extending the information given about business interests, for example in
categories of shareholdings to be listed. Such changes have yet to be
approved by parliament and would probably not be registered until early
1994.
There are now three reports from the cross-party committee on MPs' interests
in the previous parliament awaiting debate. The others deal with rules for
committee officers.
Discussion of the reports may lead to calls for a more fundamental reform of
the rules on MPs' links with business. Mr Roy Hattersley, Labour's deputy
leader, called the present system 'a parliamentary disaster', because 'it
has allowed Members to take money from anybody and everybody as long as they
admitted their connections'.

FT  12 MAY 92 / Parliament and Politics: Tory Euro-sceptics threaten
rebellion
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TORY 'Euro-sceptics' say more than a dozen Conservative MPs are prepared to
vote against the government over the legislation ratifying the Maastricht
agreement. Such a move might put the government's majority at risk.
The Euro-sceptics believe that the debate on the European Community has
moved on since just a handful of Tories voted against the Maastricht deal
when MPs debated it last December, and point to the much greater prospect of
putting the government under pressure than when it had a majority of more
than 80 before the election.
They say that now that MPs are not under pressure to show pre-election
loyalty, some colleagues who abstained then will vote against the government
this time.
The MPs are discussing tactics and organising themselves in preparation for
the first debate on the bill, which is due to come before the Commons next
week. The committed will now try to persuade colleagues who have expressed
some concern about the agreement.
Leading campaigners are said to include former energy minister Mr Michael
Spicer (Worcestershire South), Mr James Cran (Beverley) and Mr Christopher
Gill (Ludlow).
Although no one has been excluded, the campaigners have little hope that
many of the new Tory MPs will join the rebellion, because they recognise how
hard it is for newcomers to defy the whips so soon after arriving at
Westminster.
One new Tory said he would probably vote for the government reluctantly and
would make his unease known to the whips.
The Labour party has not yet agreed how it is likely to vote on the bill.
One likely course is to put down and vote for an amendment in favour of the
social chapter, from which the UK 'opted out', but the party might abstain
on the bill itself.
The Euro-sceptics emphasise that although the government may get its
majority on the bill, Europe will remain a controversial issue.
The Tory MPs who voted against the Maastricht deal last December included
former leader of the Commons Mr John Biffen (Shropshire North); Mr Nicholas
Budgen (Wolverhampton South West); Mr Richard Shepherd (Aldridge-Brownhills)
and Mr Bill Walker (Tayside North).
Mr Ian Lang last night dampened expectations of imminent moves towards
constitutional reform for Scotland, saying that the Scottish Conservatives
had fought the recent general election 'above all else as a unionist party.'
The government remained willing to 'consider' ways of improving present
mechanisms, as long as they did not 'jeopardise' the integrity of the UK, Mr
Lang said.

FT  12 MAY 92 / Parliament and Politics: Pressure for action on Maxwell
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH and IVOR OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MINISTERS ARE to come under fresh pressure over the plight of pensioners of
companies formerly owned by Robert Maxwell, after an informal cross-party
meeting of MPs this afternoon.
Mr Richard Page, Tory MP for Hertfordshire South-West and one of the
organisers of the meeting, said yesterday that the government should give an
up-to-date statement or provide time for a Commons debate, because in
certain cases the pension money would run out at the end of June.
He also expected the meeting to agree to put a firm request to ministers for
an investigation into the role of the Investment Management Regulatory
Organisation (Imro), the self-regulatory body for the fund management
industry, which has come in for particular criticism.
The MPs are likely to renew questions to Mr Robin Leigh-Pemberton, the
governor of the Bank of England, calling on the Bank to take a more active
approach to its supervisory role.
The meeting may also lead to pressure for the early re-establishment of the
cross-party social security committee, so it can continue its investigation
into the affair. Mr Frank Field, the Labour chairman of the committee in the
last parliament, is the meeting's co-sponsor.
So far since the election, the government's only comment on the Maxwell
affair has come from Mr Peter Lilley, the social security secretary. Last
Thursday he rejected opposition calls for the government to commit itself to
underwriting any shortfall in Maxwell pension funds, but promised to
announce plans to review the framework of occupational pension law in the
next few weeks.
In the Commons, delays over the mounting of prosecutions in cases where
former employees of companies controlled by Maxwell had been 'swindled' out
of their pension rights were criticised by Mr David Winnick (Lab Walsall
North).
He pressed for an assurance that there would be no 'cover-up' over what had
occured in Maxwell's companies.
The attorney general, Sir Nicholas Lyell, said the matters arising from the
Maxwell case were being carefully, professionally and expeditiously
investigated by a special team.
Referring to a meeting of the Commons social security committee in January,
Mr David Harris (C St Ives) recalled that counsel representing one of Mr
Maxwell's sons said he should not answer questions because 'he believed he
was on the threshold of charges'.
Sir Nicholas emphasised that the counsel who appeared before the select
committee for Mr Maxwell had no authority to speak one way or the other for
the prosecution.
Also yesterday, Mr Dennis Skinner (Lab Bolsover), called for a fraud squad
investigation into Olympia and York, the troubled property developer
involved in Europe's biggest new office project at Canary Wharf in London.
He said it was a 'scandal' that the company, which owed Dollars 12bn (Pounds
6.7bn), was now in hock to the banks which, as in the Maxwell case, were
having to 'loan it money in order to keep it afloat'. Mr Skinner also said
it was 'despicable' that the government was bailing out the company.

FT  12 MAY 92 / Parliament and Politics: Ashdown seeks the right chord - The
debate over the future of the Liberal Democrats
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IF Mr Paddy Ashdown, Liberal Democrat leader, thought the world would have
changed when he arrived at the Commons yesterday, then indefatigable
optimism had got the better of him.
His weekend speech calling for Labour to work with him on an anti-Tory
alliance opened up age-old questions among Liberal Democrat MPs about the
role of the third party in a inherently two-party system.
There is no sign that the answers are any clearer.
His well-timed comments were strong on mood music but devoid of
prescription. The text suggested he believes in more than Micawberism -
waiting for something to turn up - and is restless about leading a party
with a voice only in local government and think tanks. But his vision lacked
a specific end game - even if Labour were to play ball.
It was probably quite enough for his parliamentary colleagues at this stage,
however. They are too used to misplaced promises of late surges or of
promised breakthroughs that became mirages. The consensus among the party's
MPs was that change had to be gradual.
Mr Charles Kennedy, party president, said: 'I don't think realistically that
we are going to see anything happen on the centre left until Labour have got
themselves sorted out, probably not until next spring.' Even then there
would be no scope for 'compromising our intellectual integrity'.
Liberal Democrat MPs see their general election performance only as a
success - even though the party's share of the vote fell 5 points and
parliamentary representation shrank by 2.
The result is a rather grandiloquent presumption, which Mr Ashdown seems
anxious to rework that the impossible might still be achievable without a
fundamental rethink of strategy.
Mr Simon Hughes, Liberal Democrat MP for Southwark and Bermondsey, said:
'There is a fairly widespread view that our job is to keep our identity,
avoid getting into pact/deal muddles and achieve the end of Tory rule
without allowing Labour to recover. It is how you do that which is
difficult.'
He encapsulated the party's internal contradictions, however, by adding:
'For most Liberal Democrat members and MPs, there is a limit to the number
of times you can see your party return to be a third party and in
opposition.'
Freshly elected MPs such as Mr Don Foster, who defeated former Tory chairman
Mr Chris Patten in Bath, are keen for influence on the issues that won them
their seats - education, unemployment and so on. But Mr Foster, too, insists
that that has to be 'subject to being totally unwilling to give up the
philosophy of the party'.
Given that sense of wanting to have their cake and eat it, coupled with
Liberal Democrat MPs' determination neither to bend too far towards either
Labour or the Tories, Mr Ashdown was careful in his speech to set out how
Labour would have to move towards him. He would, after all, risk losing his
own Yeovil constituency if he were to let an unreconstructed Labour party
into office.
So Labour needs to back liberal market economics, not producer interests;
embrace constitutional reform; oppose authoritarian and remote government;
and break links with the trade unions, for Mr Ashdown's support.
Since the election, though, his thinking has moved away from aiming to
replace Labour as the main opposition party. His failure to win electoral
reform notwithstanding, he now wants to move towards a European-style
pluralism with opposition political parties competing and co-operating. He
knows he cannot both set out to destroy the Labour party and urge its
friendship.
Yet his careful balancing means that even Labour MPs who would be willing to
start a dialogue are deeply distrustful. One shadow cabinet member said
yesterday Mr Ashdown was too arrogant. 'A bit of humility would be nice.'
Mr Ashdown talks of the Liberal Democrats' acting as a catalyst or 'the
gathering point for a broader movement'. In practice, he may be content to
move his party towards some form of consensus-building forum with an agenda
initiated by the new Labour leadership.
Conceivably, some of his colleagues might be prepared to compromise their
ambitions a little if, for instance, Labour were to become committed to
electoral reform.
Mr Hughes said: 'All of us are willing to facilitate ways of bringing about
an end to minority Tory government. That means exploring ways of creating a
coalition of parties and individuals committed to electoral and
constitutional reform.'
Mr Ashdown has wisely refused so far to enter into speculation about what
might or might not be workable. In reality, at this stage he does not know;
and he is aware of the sensitivities of excessive risk-taking that might
scare some Liberal Democrat MPs, perhaps too used to the tranquil waters of
third party politics.
His quest for real Liberal Democrat influence means, however, that he is
unlikely to be restrained for long.

FT  12 MAY 92 / Parliament and Politics: Waldegrave pledge on openness in
government
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT will publish the membership of cabinet committees, which make
many important decisions, within the next few days, Mr William Waldegrave
said yesterday.
He also pledged the publication of the 'guidance for ministers', rules which
prevent conflicts between ministers' private interests and public
responsibilities.
Opening the fourth day's debate on the Queen's Speech, the Citizen's Charter
minister denounced the 'disastrous attempt to make the state the production
manager' of services and industries.
The initiatives follow a general election undertaking by Mr John Major, the
prime minister, to promote more open government. There should be far more
openness 'from Whitehall to the local school', Mr Waldegrave said.
To a cacophony of protests and interventions from the Labour left wing, Mr
Waldegrave devoted the bulk of his address to outlining the shortcomings of
state ownership of industry and public services.
Nationalisation had been damaging both for the industries concerned and
consumers, he said. It was 'the central initiative' of Mr Major's
administration to return government to its 'proper role' and the remaining
nationalised industries to the marketplace.
The philosophy was not shared by all Conservatives present, however. Mr
Robert Adley, the Tory MP for Christchurch, cautioned against the automatic
assumption that the state has no role to play in any of the leading
industries or services. 'We don't want Wessex fighting Mercia in privatised
armies,' he said.
Mr John Prescott, shadow transport secretary and a contender for the Labour
party's deputy leadership, called for 'stupid' Treasury rules limiting
public-sector access to private finance to be changed.
Ms Glenda Jackson (Lab Hampstead and Highgate), one of several MPs to make
maiden speeches during yesterday's debate, said Britain should do more for
the Third World, targeting aid on the poorest countries and on the basic
requirements of health care.

FT  12 MAY 92 / Parliament and Politics: Hunt optimistic on jobs for Wales
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GROWING success for Wales in attracting inward investment was forecast by Mr
David Hunt, the Welsh secretary, in the Commons yesterday.
He announced that agreement had been reached for 10 industrial projects
involving investment of more than Pounds 18m and expected to create more
than 460 new jobs. He emphasised that in the space of a week he had been
able to announce 1,000 new jobs for Wales.
'We are very much on top of the premier league for inward investment and we
intend to stay there,' he added.
The minister appealed for co-operation in establishing a cross-party
consensus over reform of Welsh local government through the setting up of
about 23 unitary authorities.
He said a white paper would be published later in the year setting out
government proposals, which would be given legislative effect through a
separate Welsh local-government bill.
A Conservative backbencher last night highlighted a 'crisis' in the British
forestry industry, saying that the number of trees planted in 1990 was the
lowest for many years.
Claiming that present incentives were inadequate, Sir James Spicer (C Dorset
West) called on the government to make representations 'to try and pressure
the Treasury to see some sense.'
Sir Hector Monro, a junior Scottish minister, stressed that the government
had no intention of privatising the Forestry Commission.

FT  12 MAY 92 / BCCI creditors win further adjournment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE HIGH COURT granted a further adjournment yesterday to creditors of the
failed Bank of Credit and Commerce International who last week decided to
reject the proposed liquidation settlement negotiated with the Abu Dhabi
majority shareholders.
During a brief hearing lawyers for the creditors said they were seeking
clarification on the deal from the majority shareholders.
The British-based creditors are unhappy with the terms of the deal but
officials involved in the negotiations believe there is little room for
manoeuvre within the Pounds 1.7bn compensation package al-ready agreed with
Abu Dhabi.
Mr Brian Smouha, the Touche Ross chief liquidator who negotiated the deal,
refused to comment on the impasse yesterday.
The hearing will reconvene on June 8, when the liquidator will be anxious to
have secured creditors' approval as the timetable for the deal assumes that
court approvals for the deal will have been obtained by June 30.
Before the provisions in the draft agreement can take effect, the
liquidators must also secure acceptance of creditors with claims totalling
Dollars 7bn (Pounds 3.9bn) by September 30.
Outside court, Mr Keith Vaz, Labour MP for Leicester East, who has
campaigned for a better deal for depositors and former bank staff, urged Mr
Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, to intervene on behalf of depositors.
The Foreign Office said yesterday that no intervention was planned.

FT  12 MAY 92 / Residents take over their pub
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A PUBLIC house in an inner-city area targeted in an economic and social
regeneration initiative has been taken over by local residents.
The Rock, closed earlier this year, lies in Cruddas Park in Newcastle upon
Tyne, an area of high unemployment selected as a regeneration testbed three
years ago by the Newcastle Initiative, a leadership team of Business in the
Community, the voluntary organisation for business initiatives.
It has been the focus of intensive efforts by the private sector, local and
central government and residents.
Newcastle Breweries has waived the first quarter's rent to help the
community-led Cruddas Park Community Trust, chaired by Mr John Ward,
Barclays Bank regional director, to re-establish the business.
Since the trust reopened the pub's bar three weeks ago, customers have
returned. The lounge, previously used for drug dealing, is still closed.

FT  12 MAY 92 / N Ireland devolution talks go on
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS and Our Belfast Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NORTHERN Ireland's unionist and nationalist leaders yesterday set out
differing proposals for government in province as inter-party talks in
Belfast appeared to make headway.
They met briefly for a plenary session under the chairmanship of Sir Patrick
Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary. Work on models for devolution then moved
to a sub-committee chaired by Mr Jeremy Hanley, junior Northern Ireland
minister.
The sub-committee will meet today and tomorrow before reporting to a plenary
session on Friday.
The IRA said yesterday that it had planted the firebombs that ignited during
the weekend at the MetroCentre shopping complex in Gateshead, Tyne and Wear.
The complex is the biggest shoping centre in Europe.
A further device was found yesterday, bringing the total to 11, of which
eight ignited. Nobody was hurt and little damage was caused, but trading
losses were estimated to have reached a total of Pounds 1.5m.

FT  12 MAY 92 / Price Waterhouse faces renewed action
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRICE WATERHOUSE, the accountancy firm, faces the prospect of renewed legal
action over its role as auditor to BCCI after demands from plaintiffs in a
US precedent-setting lawsuit to re-try its case.
Milberg Weiss, the law firm bringing the suit against 77 defendants
including PW, lodged a document with the California central district court
yesterday requesting 'vacation' of a ruling at the end of last month that
its case should be dismissed.
Judge Consuelo Marshall dismissed the case - believed to have cost PW more
than Dollars 250,000 (Pounds 140,000) a month in legal fees - on April 30.
That left the plaintiffs the option of appealing to a higher court.
Milberg Weiss alleged yesterday that there was a conflict of interest by two
of Judge Marshall's law clerks. It claimed that they had worked on the BCCI
lawsuit after accepting employment from law firms representing key
defendants in other BCCI actions. It says it initially notified the court of
its concerns after Judge Marshall's preliminary ruling on the case at the
end of March.
The documents say the class action suit is being brought by a handful of
plaintiffs on behalf of approximately 800,000 depositors who have lost in
aggregate Dollars 8bn-Dollars 10bn.

FT  12 MAY 92 / New company broadens gas supply contest
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE COMPETITION to break down British Gas's monopoly of industrial gas
supply was broadened yesterday when a new company, claiming to be the first
truly independent supplier, entered the market.
North Sea Gas, based in Bristol, will compete for a share when British Gas
auctions some of its gas later this year. It is also close to reaching
agreement with two other gas producers.
The company, which is backed by private and institutional capital, aims to
serve small commercial and industrial customers in south and south-west
England and south Wales.
Five of the 14 existing competitors to British Gas are joint ventures
between regional electricity companies and Utilicorp, the second-largest
gas-marketing company in the US. The other nine are owned by oil or gas
production companies. North Sea Gas is the first independent supplier with
no links to a producer.
Its announcement came only days after Mr Tim Eggar, energy minister,
indicated that this year he would reduce the threshold for consumption under
which rivals to British Gas are allowed into the market from 25,000 therms a
year to 2,500 therms.
North Sea Gas has received authorisation to operate from Ofgas, the industry
regulator, and so is guaranteed receipt of at least the minimum allocation
of 10m therms when British Gas sells 500m therms of its gas to competitors
in October. It will deliver gas through existing pipes and meters by renting
use of the mains system from British Gas.
Mr Ian Powe, chairman of the Gas Consumers' Council, said he had been
eagerly awaiting the arrival of companies such as North Sea Gas. 'This is
the first example of true competition in terms of purity of operation,' he
said. 'They are only going to be in business if they can get gas at a decent
price and sell it on at a decent price.'
Mr John Dorken, deputy director-general of Ofgas, also welcomed the company.

FT  12 MAY 92 / Ryan Group will bid in coal sell-off
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIET SYCHRAVA
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RYAN GROUP, the UK's largest privately owned coal producer, said yesterday
that it would bid for part of British Coal when it is privatised.
The company's announcement that it had restructured its finances in
preparation for a possible bid was the first sign of potential buyers
gathering as the government pushes ahead its plans to sell British Coal.
Ryan has received a Pounds 50m equity injection from a City consortium led
by Electra, the fund management company. That will strengthen Ryan's capital
base so that it can take advantage of any opportunities to buy parts of
British Coal. Electra, together with consortium partners Bankers Trust and
Creditanstalt, will also provide a Pounds 65m loan facility, of which Pounds
35m will be used initially.
Mr Crispian Hotson, Ryan's chief executive, said that mining companies such
as Anglo-United, Hanson, and RTZ, as well as international coal companies,
would bid for parts of British Coal.
Ryan will be one of the smallest companies interested in British Coal - it
produces 6m tonnes of coal compared with British Coal's 90m. Mr Hotson threw
down a challenge to British Coal. 'We could get their costs down, and so
could a number of international companies,' he said.
He rejected reports from NM Rothschild, the merchant bank advising on the
privatisation, forecasting that competition from gas and imported coal might
force British Coal's total output down from 90m tonnes to 35m - 40m tonnes.
British Coal's pits could produce 50m tonnes of competitive coal, he said.
At world prices, that might mean a revenue of close to Pounds 1bn.
Although there are so far no details of how British Coal might be sold, it
is likely that it will be split into several companies, and Ryan hopes it
will be able to bid for smaller businesses. Although Ryan did not indicate
how much it might spend, it is likely to be interested in south Wales, where
it has some deep mines, or the profitable opencast mining business, where it
works as a contractor to British Coal.
'We aren't interested in huge tonnages,' Mr Hotson said. 'We want the bit
you can make money out of.'
The Electra deal will enable Ryan to clear the debt of more than Pounds 100m
it inherited from the management buy-out that formed the company from the
quoted company Ryan International in 1989. In the year ending December 1990
(the last published results) the company's interest charge of close to
Pounds 20m cancelled out its Pounds 11.2m operating profit.

FT  12 MAY 92 / Truck and van sales fall 11.3%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent and JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UK NEW commercial vehicle sales fell by 11.3 per cent in April when compared
with the same month last year, with the continuing decline contrasting
sharply with the improvement in new car registrations last month.
New commercial vehicle registrations fell to 17,220 in April compared with
19,406 in April last year, the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders
reported yesterday.
The fall in registrations was the 31st successive monthly year-on-year
decline. Sales last month were 48.7 per cent lower than in April 1989.
New commercial vehicle registrations in the first four months of this year,
at 70,307, were 11.5 per cent lower than a year before. Registrations have
fallen by 47.8 per cent over the past three years.
The commercial vehicle sector is a significant economic barometer, with
vehicles going to many important sectors from retail distribution to
construction.
Truckmakers have suffered their steepest decline of the post-Second World
War period, with sales falling last year to the lowest level since 1954.
Commercial vehicle registrations last month were lower in all segments of
the market, including the heavy truck market, which had shown the first
signs of recovery in March.
Sales of heavy trucks (above 15 tonnes gross vehicle weight) in April at
1,219 were 7.2 per cent lower than a year ago.
The renewed decline followed an 18.0 per cent increase in March - the first
monthly year-on-year rise achieved since September 1989 - which suggested
that an end to the recession in the commercial vehicle market was in sight,
at least in the heaviest weight ranges.
Overall truck sales (above 3.5 tonnes) in April, at 2,449, were 7.5 per cent
lower than a year ago, while medium van registrations dropped by 12.7 per
cent and small van sales fell by 13.2 per cent.
In the truck market, Iveco, the commercial vehicles subsidiary of Fiat of
Italy, has regained market leadership from Leyland DAF, the UK subsidiary of
DAF of the Netherlands, which led the market last year. The Iveco group,
which includes Seddon Atkinson, gained 24.4 per cent of the market in the
first four months, while Leyland DAF fell back to 22.6 per cent from 24.5
per cent a year ago.
In the medium van market, Volkswagen and Leyland DAF have both achieved
gains in sales volume in spite of the continuing fall in the overall market.
AN EXPECTED post-election strengthening of the used car market failed to
materialise last month, John Griffiths writes.
Statistics from HPI, the hire purchase monitoring group, show the number of
finance agreements on used cars last month fell by 7.1 per cent, to 73,483,
from 79,023 in March. The fall reverses a recovery for the first quarter as
a whole, when credit-financed sales of used cars rose by 9.25 per cent
compared with the first quarter of last year.

FT  12 MAY 92 / BBC details open-market scheme for its services
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BBC yesterday acted to expose all its services to competition and the
open market - a process that might lead to the loss of several thousand
staff jobs.
The corporation issued to staff detailed guidelines on how Producer Choice -
the system of giving programme producers the freedom to buy services such as
camera crews, design, make-up or even studios outside the BBC - will work.
The introduction of the open market, which should be in full operation in a
year, is designed to make more money available for programmes.
It is also one of the most potentially revolutionary changes in the way the
BBC is run.
Mr Will Wyatt, managing director of BBC Television and a member of a
resources committee that recommended the move to an open market, said: 'The
aim is to compare costs (with the independent production sector), make costs
transparent and reveal the full costs of the organisation.'
Under the scheme, programme production departments and departments offering
production services will become business units trading on a full-cost basis
with prices 'a matter for negotiation between buyer and seller'.
The scheme applies to the BBC's television and radio network, regional
broadcasting and news and current affairs.
Sir Michael Checkland, BBC director-general, warned last August that by the
end of next year there would be 3,000 fewer staff jobs, partly because of
initiatives such as Producer Choice and partly because of the move to 25 per
cent independent production.
Mr Tony Lennon, president of the Bectu broadcasting union, said yesterday
that the issuing of the guidelines 'has finally confirmed that the entire
BBC support services and transmission will be moving to self-funding within
an internal market or go bust'.
Mr Lennon, whose union is holding an eight-hour strike on Friday as a
protest against Producer Choice, added: 'This will turn the BBC into a
tented army of autonomous business units.'
Under the scheme, the aim of each business unit will be to break even rather
than make a profit and, at least to begin with, neither surpluses nor
deficits will be carried forward from one financial year to the next.
There will be a management assessment of any unit's failure to break even.
Achieving break-even will then be expected the following year.
'Decisions to keep open a business unit which cannot achieve break-even can
only be made by the board of management,' the guidelines warn.
All the new units will have to pay the market value of property occupied to
encourage cuts in accommodation, meet charges for working capital and
equipment and pay their share of overheads.
Mr Michael Starks, Producer Choice project director and a former head of
resources in BBC Radio, said yesterday that he believed the new system would
be 'quite a strong, powerful engine for putting pressure on the (BBC
bureaucracy'.
Considerable effort is also being made to train staff in more
market-oriented disciplines. By the end of this year nearly 2,000 will have
attended Producer Choice workshops or training courses.
The first evidence of the operation of Producer Choice, introduced in the
film department in April last year, suggests that jobs will be lost, but
that there will not be a total stampede to the outside market. Out of 53
film crews in the department before Producer Choice, 13 have gone.
Mr Wyatt said opening the BBC to market forces would make available a choice
producers had long sought. It would also offer 'demonstrable efficiency'
before renegotiation of the BBC's charter at the end of 1996.

FT  12 MAY 92 / Judith Ward is freed by court
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE, Legal Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MISS JUDITH WARD, jailed for life in 1974 for the M62 Army coach bombing in
which 12 people died, was freed on bail yesterday by the Court of Appeal
pending the formal quashing of her convictions.
The court ruled that confessions made by Miss Ward, 43, to the M62 attack
and two other bombings could no longer be relied on and her conviction was
therefore 'unsafe and unsatisfactory'.
Lord Justice Glidewell told her that her appeal would be allowed in due
course but the court wanted to continue hearing evidence on scientific
aspects of the case.
At her trial in 1974, scientific evidence was presented by Dr Frank Skuse,
the former Home Office forensic scientist, that Miss Ward had handled
nitroglycerine. The test used was discredited last year during the appeal of
the Birmingham Six.
Miss Ward, from Stockport, Greater Manchester, was sentenced to life
imprisonment with concurrent 30-year terms for complicity in the other
bombings, in spite of evidence, available at the time, that she was mentally
ill and prone to inventing stories about her involvement with the IRA.
Her release after 18 years in jail brings to an end a series of miscarriages
of justice stemming from the 1974 IRA mainland bombing campaign. The cases
of the Guildford Four, the Maguire Seven and the Birmingham Six prompted the
government to appoint a royal commission on criminal justice under the
chairmanship of Lord Runciman.
The commission's report, to be published next year, is expected to lead to
an overhaul of the criminal appeal system. West Yorkshire police, who
investigated the M62 bombing, last night expressed regret for the years Miss
Ward had spent in prison.
Mr Tom Cook, assistant chief constable, said they would re-examine evidence
gathered at the time of the bombing.

FT  12 MAY 92 / Copyright plans alarm film world
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UK television and film industry has expressed its 'grave concern' to Mr
Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, over European Commission
copyright pro-posals.
British broadcasters say plans from Brussels to harmonise copyright
throughout the Community 'would wholly undermine the copyright system which
governs audio-visual production in the UK'.
A proposed directive would provide for 'equitable remuneration' for any
actor appearing in a film or television programme being offered for video
rental. All actors involved in a production would have a right to authorise
or prohibit the renting of audiovisual works.
The Commission originally sought to extend the controversial rights to all
forms of distribution and reproduction, but that has been dropped.
'These provisions would be applied retrospectively with alarming
implications for owners of film and programme libraries,' the letter warns.
It is signed by senior executives from the BBC; ITV; Channel 4; Pact, the
independent producers alliance; British Screen Finance; and by Mr David
Puttnam and Sir Richard Attenborough, the film producers.
The broadcasters and film makers believe the Commission has pursued its
objectives without thinking of the implications for the UK industry or
'considered the damaging effect on European production and the benefits it
will give to competitors outside the EC'.
They want the British government to intervene when the issue comes before
the Council of Ministers.
Mr Clive Leach, chairman of ITV's European committee, said: 'Potentially
this directive is a dagger pointed at the heart of European programme
production. It will hamper investment in programmes and put us at a
competitive disadvantage with America and Australia.'
The directive would cover all works in copyright on July 1 1994, but will
only be retrospective where artists have made a request to that effect
before January 1997. The system of 'equitable remuneration' is due to begin
in July 1997.
Critics believe tens of thousands of contracts might have to be
renegotiated.

FT  12 MAY 92 / Demand for credit weakens in first quarter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DEMAND for credit by consumers was weak in the first quarter, according to
government figures released yesterday which did little to support theories
about economic upturn before the general election.
According to the Central Statistical Office, consumers repaid a net Pounds
270m on credit agreements between January and March, the largest quarterly
repayment since records began in 1975.
In the final quarter of last year there was a seasonally adjusted repayment
of a revised Pounds 16m, while in the previous quarter net new borrowing
came to Pounds 234m.
The period between October last year and March marks the first time since
1975 in which consumers have made net repayments on this type of credit for
two consecutive quarters.
The figures underline the weakness in the economy that was behind the
government's decision last week to reduce interest rates by 0.5 of a point
to 10 per cent.
The Conservatives' election victory, however, may have provoked a spurt in
economic activity that has yet to show up in statistics.
Yesterday's figures apply to virtually all forms of consumer credit except
mortgages. On March 31, Pounds 52.8bn was outstanding on such credit,
compared with Pounds 53.07bn at the end of last year.
In the first quarter, consumers repaid loans on bank personal accounts worth
Pounds 249m, the first quarter since records started to have shown a
repayment. Between October and December last year, net new loans on personal
accounts came to Pounds 100m.
Net new borrowings in the first quarter on credit cards came to Pounds 125m,
little changed from the Pounds 133m registered in the final three months of
last year.
A breakdown of the data shows that in March consumers repaid Pounds 69m on
the so-called narrow measure of credit - which accounts for about 60 per
cent of all credit and fails to include bank loans on personal accounts, and
loans on credit cards outside the Mastercard and Visa systems. It also
excludes loans from insurance companies and retailers.
The March figure means that in seven out of the past eight months consumers
have made a repayment on this measure of credit, which includes non-mortgage
loans with building societies and finance houses.

FT  12 MAY 92 / Time targets
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
British Rail yesterday published the first figures to show its performance
against targets on a line-by-line basis since the Passenger's Charter was
introduced two months ago. The chart shows how four of the 15 Network
SouthEast routes and five out of the seven InterCity routes are missing the
punctuality targets in the BR Passenger's Charter. Regional Railways, the
provincial network, is doing rather better: only two of its 22 routes (Cross
Country and East and West Midlands) are failing to meet the required
standard.
Under the Passenger's Charter, regular rail customers will receive discounts
on season ticket renewals if their lines fail to meet performance targets by
more than a narrow margin over a 12-month period.

FT  12 MAY 92 / Accounting practice on assets highlighted
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MORE companies are adopting the controversial practice of not depreciating
fixed assets such as buildings, an analysis by Company Reporting, the
Edinburgh-based accounts monitoring service, indicated yesterday.
It said that 22 per cent of a sample of 630 companies showed in their latest
annual accounts evidence of assets that were not depreciated.
The practice appears to be taken for granted by water companies, which do
not depreciate infrastructure assets such as water mains, sewers, pipelines
and reservoirs. Accounting standard SSAP 12 stipulates that a charge for
depreciation should be shown in the profit-and-loss account for assets with
a finite economic life - including for buildings.
However, the Financial Reporting Review Panel, the policing arm of the UK's
new accounting standards regime, appeared to endorse the practice of
non-depreciation on certain assets when it cleared Forte, the hotels group,
of breaching that standard in February.

MANY TRAVEL agents are 'incompetent and lazy' and waste money by making
basic errors, according to a report from Which?, the Consumers' Association

The magazine says more than half its inquiries to 253 travel agents in 10
cities were handled badly, with agents telling half-truths and quoting
unnecessarily high fares.
Only one in five agents was able to find the cheapest routine flight to Nice
 -a Pounds 129 offer from British Airways. Which? says Hogg Robinson
provided the best service of the five big travel chains.

FT  12 MAY 92 / Results of City rules review welcomed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LEGAL relationship between many of the UK's financial institutions and
their clients should not be subjected to fresh upheaval, the Law Commission,
the main legal reform body in the UK, recommends in a consultative paper
issued today.
The commission's paper, coming after a two-year review, was welcomed in the
City yesterday.
The general view among regulators and firms is that the present legal
position may be uncertain and messy, but it is preferable to fresh
legislation that might reopen many of the debates that preceded the UK's
Financial Services Act of 1986. The commission's views were sought by Mr
John Redwood, then minister for corporate affairs, in April 1990. He had
become concerned about the interaction of common-law fiduciary duties, which
spell out the basic legal relationship between advisers or brokers and their
clients, with the superstructure of rules for the investment industry
created by the Financial Services Act.
The rules do not match common law in all respects. In common law, for
instance, an agent - whether an insurance broker, stockbroker or any other
adviser - must disclose all commissions and other forms of income to a
client. The regulatory rules do not require this full dis-closure.
Also regulations allow investment banks to operate with 'Chinese walls'  -
barriers between different parts of their business to prevent conflicts of
interest or leaks of confidential information - whereas common law does not
recognise the existence of such internal divisions.
There have been no test cases on those and other discrepancies produced by
the Financial Services Act. The legal basis of many common City practices
has been left uncertain as a result - which makes City lawyers, still
stinging from the legal impact of the local authority swaps fiasco, nervous.
The commission considered four options:
Allowing regulatory rules to override common law. That would give financial
firms a 'safe harbour' from prosecution for breach of fiduciary duty,
provided they obeyed the regulations.
Even the City's self-regulating organisations seem to agree this would be
putting too much power into the hands of regulators. One said: 'The City may
be crying out for certainty. But the idea of giving SROs the power to
override common law is a nightmare.'
Leaving common law and regulatory rules to operate in their own spheres, but
not to attempt to relate them. That, says the commission, 'would lead to
great complication and uncertainty'.
Replicating common-law requirements in the regulators' rules. That would be
impractical, the commission says, since fiduciary duties are formulated in a
'broad and general way', and so would be difficult to turn into regulations.
Requiring the courts to take into account regulatory rules when deciding
whether a firm has fulfilled its common law duties. 'We provisionally favour
this approach,' says the commission. One reason is that 'it does not favour
an abdication of control by the courts in favour of the regulators.'
Under such an arrangement, the courts would assess the 'reasonableness' of
the regulators' own rules and a firm's compliance with them when assessing
compliance with the common law.
The commission says that may already be the state of the law, although
confirmation of that would be helpful.
In the City, where memories of the convoluted passage of the Financial
Services Act are still fresh, the recommendation was greeted with some
relief. Any other solution might have needed legislation - and the risk that
the City's self-regulatory system would again be exposed to political
scrutiny.
The British Merchant Banking and Securities Houses Association, a City trade
association, said: 'The regulatory system needs time to settle down. The
great majority of our members thought that to legislate would just cause
further uncertainties.'

PROPOSALS to build a 680,000 sq ft office and residential complex on the
site of the Westminster Hospital close to the Houses of Parliament were
yesterday submitted for planning approval.
The existing buildings on the 4.6-acre site south of Horseferry Road will be
demolished when the hospital moves next year to the Westminster and Chelsea
Hospital being built on the site of St Stephen's Hospital in Fulham Road.
The site will be put up for sale to the highest bidder once planning consent
has been granted.
The application, which concerns the Westminster Hospital and the adjoining
Queen Mary Nurses' Home and School of Medicine, was submitted by the British
Land Company, North West Thames Regional Health Authority and the Special
Trustees of Westminster and Roehampton Hospitals.
It follows last year's appointment by the health authority of British Land
and Terry Farrell and Company, architects, as development consultants.
British Land was asked to design an office building with a residential
element in a style that reflected the site's prominent location. The
proposals include 395,000 sq ft of offices, 232,000 sq ft of homes, and
12,000 sq ft of mixed-use space.

FT  12 MAY 92 / World Trade News: Foreign chip makers advance into Europe -
The trend is to dominance by US and Japanese groups
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN the rural setting of Avezzano, a peaceful town about 100km east of Rome,
Texas Instruments of the US on Friday officially opened a new factory making
semiconductor chips for the European market.
It is just the latest in a number of foreign-owned chip plants to open in
Europe. One of the world's most advanced plants, it provides vivid testimony
to the growing foreign presence in the European semiconductor market.
The Avezzano plant, where Texas Instruments will produce 4-megabit dynamic
random access memory (DRAM) chips for use in a broad range of electronics
products from personal computers to telecommunications systems, has been the
subject of some controversy since it was announced in 1989.
At a time when indigenous semiconductor manufacturers have been struggling
for survival in the increasingly competitive trading environment, the US
group has secured more than half the cost of its main investment in Europe
from the Italian government, which is providing as much as Dollars 650m
(Pounds 367m) of the Dollars 1.2bn the programme is costing.
The Avezzano plant raises difficult issues not only for Europe's indigenous
chip makers, faced with a growing foreign presence in their own market, but
also for European industrial policy.
In the world of semiconductors, Europe as a market place is coming to mirror
more and more the world trend towards dominance by the large US and Japanese
groups.
Foreign chip makers have been stepping up their activity in Europe in
response to a growing need to be closer to customers, in order to remain
competitive.
They have also been under pressure from their own customers in Europe, led
by the large US computer and information technology groups, to move
production to the region and supply them with locally designed and
manufactured products to meet the EC's local content rules.
Last year Fujitsu, the Japanese computer and semiconductor group, started
producing 4-megabit DRAMS in England and, NEC, the Japanese electronics and
semiconductor group, added a 4-megabit DRAM facility to its plant in
Scotland.
Hitachi and Mitsubishi, the integrated Japanese electronics groups, have
also announced plans to set up DRAM production in Europe.
Local production of memory chips by the foreigners comes when the Europeans
are already losing their grip over their own market. The top three European
manufacturers still dominate the European rankings, but they each lost
market share last year, according to a survey by Dataquest, the high
technology consultancy.
Philips, the Dutch electronics group, maintained its leading position in the
European semiconductor market, but saw sales growth of just 1.5 per cent,
against growth in the European market of 6.8 per cent.
Siemens of Germany followed in second place but posted a 0.6 per cent
decline in sales, while SGS-Thomson, the Franco-Italian group in third
place, saw sales decline 2.3 per cent.
As a group, European semiconductor makers saw their share of the European
market fall from 39 to 38 per cent last year, even before a number of new
foreign-owned plants have started to turn out products in volume.
The growing presence of foreign manufacturers in the EC means that although
by 1995 Europe will be producing about 60 per cent of its indigenous demand
for 4-megabit DRAMS, 80 per cent of that locally-produced supply will come
from foreign-owned manufacturers, Dataquest says.
The remaining 20 per cent will come from Siemens, the German group which is
the only remaining European manufacturer still producing DRAMS.
In the short term, the volume production by foreign makers of memory chips
for the European market poses the greatest threat to Siemens.
But as production of semiconductor chips in Europe increases in line with
any pick-up in economic activity, the European market is likely to be fought
over more among themselves by foreign manufacturers.
'The competition here is the same as we face anywhere in the world,' says Mr
Jerry Junkins, chairman, president and chief executive officer of Texas
Instruments. That competition comes from the large US, Japanese and
increasingly Korean, manufacturers rather than the European, which hardly
have a presence outside their home market.
The deal between Texas Instruments and the Italian government, which has one
of the EC's worst records for high-technology investment, is also
instructive as a likely harbinger of things to come.
The agreement provides the Italian government, also under pressure to assist
in recapitalising SGS-Thomson, the semiconductor joint venture with the
French Thomson group, with investment from the US group, in a deprived
region in an industry the government would like to support.
But Texas Instruments believes it is also indicative of a growing
recognition in Europe that foreign manufacturers have a contribution to
make.
'I am convinced there is a new direction taking place in Brussels which
recognises the importance of good European citizens like ourselves and the
contribution these companies can make to improve the competitiveness of the
European electronics industry,' says Mr Roberto Schisano, president of Texas
Instruments in Europe and vice-president of the its semiconductor group.
Whether the attitude in Brussels has seen such a change or not, the
Italian-American partnership reflects a growing trend for investment in new
semiconductor technology in Europe, and therefore European competitiveness
in electronics, to be increasingly dependent on foreign manufacturers.

THE US has announced limited trade sanctions against Russia and India in
protest at the sale of Russian rocket technology to the Indian space
authority, George Graham reports from Washington.
The two-year ban covers sales of US goods needing an export licence, to
Russia's space institute Glavkosmos or the Indian Space Research
Organisation (Isro). US imports from, or government orders with, Glavkosmos
and Isro come under the same ban.
A US official said Missile Technology Control Regime members had tried to
dissuade Russia from selling the rocket motors to India; they believe it
violates MTCR rules against missile technology proliferation. Technology for
peaceful satellite launchers and ballistic missiles was almost
indistinguishable; US sanctions applied where a rocket system could deliver
a 500kg payload for 300km.

<TEXT>
EFFORTS to reform the way US political campaigns are financed have again run
aground, but the issue seems likely to haunt politicians in November's
elections.
President George Bush this weekend vetoed a bill passed by the
Democratic-controlled Congress that would have set voluntary limits on
campaign spending in return for partial government funding.
The bill would also have curbed 'soft money' donations channelled through
political parties, but would have done little to reduce the influence of
political action committees (PACs), interest groups which are among the main
financiers of elections for the House of Representatives.
Sponsors of the reform admit they have little hope of overriding the veto,
which would require a two-thirds majority of both the Senate and House. But
some Democrats believe Mr Bush's move could lose him votes this autumn.
On three occasions in recent weeks Mr Bush has faced fund-raising
embarrassment: when a Bush-Quayle fundraising dinner listed a number of
corporate sponsors, in apparent violation of a ban on company donations;
when a Republican fundraiser was sued by his employees who claimed he had
coerced them into contributing to the party; and when the Republican party
had to place in escrow a Dollars 400,000 (Pounds 226,000) donation from a
man whose former wives and business partners say he owes them several times
that amount.
Most Republicans oppose the principle of government financing for
congressional election campaigns - although they condone a similar system
for presidential campaigns by which the government matches small
contributions. They point out that the Democrats fudged the issue by failing
to include in their bill any ideas about where the government money would
come from.
Republicans also oppose the concept of spending limits, on the grounds that
challengers must be free to spend as much as they need to overcome the
built-in advantages of an incumbent.
MR Ross Perot moved closer to becoming a full-fledged presidential candidate
yesterday, submitting petitions with 225,000 signatures - four times more
than needed - requesting an independent spot on November's election ballot
in his home state of Texas, Agencies report.

FT  12 MAY 92 / Canberra raises deficit forecast
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AUSTRALIA'S federal budget deficit is expected to reach ADollars 9.3bn
(Pounds 3.97bn) in the year to the end of June, the government said
yesterday. The forecast is nearly double the budget estimate published in
August, and ADollars 2.5bn higher than the last revision three months ago.
Mr Paul Keating, Labor prime minister, announced the revised forecast during
talks with state leaders on planned reforms to financial and administrative
links between Canberra and the states.
He said the deterioration was caused by a shortfall in tax receipts, and
forecast a further rise in the deficit to ADollars 10.5bn for 1992-93. The
government expects the budget to return to surplus in 1995-96.
The 1992-93 deficit will be the biggest in cash terms since the mid-1950s.
However, at about 2.4 per cent of gross domestic product, it will fall far
short of the record 4.75 per cent deficit accumulated by the last Labor
government in 1974-75.
The government said the revision reflected a shortfall in tax revenue caused
by administrative changes, poor forecasting, and a slower than expected
recovery from recession.
Mr John Hewson, the federal opposition leader, said the revision would
increase pressure on Mr Keating to hold the election by the end of this
year; it must be held by mid-1993.
Mr Keating told state premiers that the deficit increase would not permit a
reversal of cuts in federal transfers which the states blame for their
aggregate debt of ADollars 7bn.
He also rejected proposals for a guaranteed share of federal tax revenues,
and told the states to ease their financial problems by increasing
efficiency and cutting costs.
However, the government agreed to consider increasing the predictability of
state funding by switching to a three-year financing regime. The two sides
will produce a joint study of state finances before the next round of talks
in June.

<TEXT>
THE European Community told Israel last night that its prospects for closer
economic ties with the Twelve were dim until Israel proved more conciliatory
in the Middle East peace talks and more appreciative of the EC's role in the
peace process.
Israel objects to full EC participation in the talks on disarmament. The
atmosphere for last night's meeting of the EC-Israel Co-operation Council
was further soured by Israel's boycott of a parallel meeting in Brussels of
the peace conference's working group on regional economic development,
chaired by the EC.
Mr David Levy, Israel's foreign minister, repeated his government's
objection to meeting, in this group, Palestinians from outside the West Bank
and Gaza Strip.
Mr Joao de Deus Pinheiro, Portugal's foreign minister, said he hoped that at
least Israel would attend future sessions of this working group.
For his part, Mr Levy expressed dismay that the Community had recently
pressurised its neighbours in the European Free Trade Association (Efta)
into refusing to sign a free trade accord with Israel. EC leverage on Efta
is considerable, because many Efta members have applied for full EC
membership.
Israel has been pushing for its trade and financial agreement with the EC to
be updated and expanded, particularly in the light of the commercial
concessions Brussels is granting to the countries of Efta and central
Europe.

<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FRANCE'S government plans a slight relaxation of its policy of fiscal rigour
next year, but still intends to keep the budget deficit below 2 per cent of
gross domestic product.
In a circular to spending ministries, Mr Pierre Beregovoy, prime minister,
has ordered that total volume of budgetary expenditure may rise only 3.5 per
cent. This compares with a forecast rate of inflation of 2.8 per cent, and a
5.5 per cent expected nominal rise in gross domestic product.
The increase in spending and the continued sluggishness in tax receipts, as
a result of the recession, mean that next year's budget deficit is likely to
rise to around FFr150bn (Pounds 15.13bn), against FFr135bn this year.
This increased deficit would nevertheless be less than 2 per cent of GDP,
which the government regards as a politically critical ceiling. By setting
this new maximum, it intends to show that France is fully able to meet the
conditions for participation in European monetary union, which include a
budgetary deficit ceiling of no more than 3 per cent of GDP.
Spending priorities in next year's budget will be job creation and
employment, and education. The government also intends to reduce employment
in government service.

parties

   By ROBERT GRAHAM

<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
WITH tomorrow's presidential election looming, Italy's political parties
yesterday intensified their efforts to agree on a candidate.
Since Mr Francesco Cossiga resigned as the country's eighth president on
April 25, the main parties have been torn by internal divisions and doubts
about the type of person who should become head of state when the two houses
of parliament, plus 58 delegates from regional councils, meet to vote
tomorrow.
The politicians are having to take account of the profound public
disaffection with the Italian political system and demands for serious
institutional reform evidenced by the vote in the April 5 general election.
This has made it difficult for the outgoing coalition of Christian
Democrats, Socialists, Social Democrats and Liberals to push through their
own candidate without a broader consensus.
The Christian Democrats, as the largest parliamentary party and with a
strong claim to the presidency, have come under pressure to make the first
move. However, they have been shaken by the general election when their vote
fell below 30 per cent for the first time.
Much of the blame has fallen on the the party's two heavy-weight contenders
 -Mr Giulio Andreotti, the outgoing premier, and Mr Arnaldo Forlani, the
party secretary. Before the general election, Mr Andreotti had made it clear
the presidency was the last great office he had not held and his candidacy
would be a fitting conclusion to more than 40 years in politics.
The Socialists for their part have been badly tainted by the municipal
corruption scandal in Milan, the power base of the party leader, Mr Bettino
Craxi.
Last night, the city's mayor, Mr Piero Borghini, announced his resignation
after the muncipal council had become unworkable as a result of the
political impact of the affair in which the Socialists are allegedly heavily
involved in the channeling of funds from rigged contracts to political
parties.
The broad-based council administration automatically resigned with him and
last night it was unclear how the city would find durable government without
fresh elections. Mr Borghini, a former editor of the Communist daily,
L'Unita and left-wing independent, agreed to take-over as mayor barely 100
days ago.
The city's two previous mayors are currently being investigated by
magistrates for alleged corruption. But there has been no suggestion of Mr
Borghini's involvement in the affair, which has lead to 26 local
politicians, businessmen and officials being arrested.
The scandal has damaged Mr Craxi, and although he has mainly had his eye on
the next premiership, he has been a presidential possible.
However, in what appeared to be an acknowledgement that he was out of the
running, Mr Craxi last night nominted Mr Giuliano Vassalli, a former
Socialist justice minister and current member of the constitutional court,
to be the party's candidate.
Whatever deal is cut on the presidency, it is likely to be part of a broader
arrangement over the formation of a new government. Since the president's
powers are largely formal, involving the dissolution of parliament and
nomination of prime ministers, the main parties may be willing to let a
lesser figure or someone from a minor party hold the office.
There are three other Christian Democrat possibilities: Mr Ciriaco de Mita,
party president and former prime minister; Mr Oscar Luigi Scalfaro, recently
elected leader of the Chamber of Deputies; and Ms Tina Anselmi, a veteran
parliamentarian with substantial cross-party support.
Mr Giovanni Spadolini, the Republic's interim president, must stand a good
chance. As a former prime minister he is a skilful political consensus
builder and has a good public image as an amiable father-figure.
The Party of the Democratic Left (former Communist party) is proposing Ms
Nilde Iotti, for 11 years leader of the Chamber of Deputies.
Of the outsiders, the best known is octogenarian left-wing philosopher
Norberto Bobbio. But Mr Cossiga is also on the side-lines ready to be
recalled.
In the first three votes a two-thirds majority is necessary; thereafter a
simple majority. On previous occasions such has been the disagreement that
the voting has gone to 23 sessions.
This time the individual votes of politicians in 16 different parties will
have to be taken into account by the lobbyists.

<DATELINE>

<TEXT>
THE European Commission's plan to increase Community revenue by 35 per cent
by 1997 opened a gulf between north and south yesterday, when foreign
ministers of the Twelve began detailed negotiations on the so-called Delors
II package.
While these negotiations are still at an early stage, and a certain amount
of posturing has to be discounted, the depth of disagreement could affect
ratification of the Maastricht treaty, and complicate discussion of EC
enlargement.
The north of the Community, with Britain in the vanguard, strongly opposed
the ambition of Mr Jacques Delors, Commission president, to double
structural spending on the four least prosperous member states - Spain,
Ireland, Portugal and Greece. Ministers and officials from these states
accused their richer partners of reneging on a deal which made the
Maastricht treaty possible.
The Delors proposals call for an increase in the EC budget from Ecu66.6bn
(Pounds 46.62bn) this year to Ecu87.5bn in 1997, at 1992 prices. Half the
increase would go to the south and periphery for regional aid and
'cohesion', to help them modernise their economies in preparation for
monetary union later this decade. The rest is to finance farm reform, the
EC's growing foreign policy commitments, and a sharpened research effort to
strengthen industrial competition.
Mr Douglas Hurd, UK foreign secretary, said an increase of more than 5 per
cent a year in the EC budget was not justified. He complained that the
Commission had put the 'cohesion fund' agreed at Maastricht into next year's
budget, when the new treaty foresaw its introduction before the end of 1993.
He added that the far bigger 'structural funds' - Ecu18.6bn this year and
due to rise to Ecu29.3bn in 1997 under Commission plans - should not be
increased. A rise of this size would give the southerners more than 90 per
cent of their aid increase which 'is not an assumption justified by
Maastricht', he insisted, in the UK's most uncompromising response to Delors
II so far.
The Netherlands asked for the EC Court of Auditors to report on use of the
existing structural funds before any decision was taken. Germany, the EC's
biggest net contributor, backed Britain on aid for the south, but signalled
once more it would seek renegotiation of the rebate on UK contributions
secured by former prime minister Mrs Margaret Thatcher in 1984.
A UK Treasury official said: 'We are not prepared to see any changes.' The
rebate was worth Ecu3.3bn last year.
Mr Francisco Fernandez Ordonez, Spain's foreign minister, said that while
'in Maastricht figures weren't discussed, aiming at minimalist figures (for
cohesion) would be pure sarcasm'. He said it was 'not more documents, but
more decisions' that were needed. 'We work on the basis of confidence, under
which pacts are respected, therefore Maastricht has to be fulfilled.'
Spain demanded a commitment to raise fiscal transfers to the south
significantly as the price of agreeing Maastricht. Mr Fernandez Ordonez
warned yesterday that the discussion on enlargement due to begin at the
Lisbon summit in June would be held up until adequate future financing of
the EC was agreed, a prospect now unlikely before the Edinburgh summit in
December.
Irish officials called yesterday for a push to get at least agreement in
principle on Delors II at Lisbon. 'What is needed is a political decision,
and for us the political decision was taken at Maastricht,' one official
said.
France, the other net contributor to the budget apart from Germany and the
UK, is staying non-committal on Delors II until it sees how farm spending
will affect its rich agriculture sector. The Community yesterday formally
adopted rules on satellite broadcasting designed to pave the way for
high-definition television in Europe, Reuter reports from Brussels.
The directive, adopted without discussion by EC foreign ministers, requires
all HDTV transmissions to use the European-developed HD-MAC standard.
All other wide-screen broadcasts must use the D2-MAC standard, an interim
step to cinema-quality HDTV.
Editorial comment, Page 18
Denmark may next month block Mr Jacques Delors' renomination as Commission
president, unless the latter publicly denies any intention of proposing a
more powerful Community executive which would effectively eclipse the
rotating EC presidency, writes David Buchan in Brussels. Denmark is upset
that press reports of the Delors ideas might lead to defeat for the
Maastricht treaty in Denmark's June 2 referendum. Mr Delors said yesterday
he had personally made none of the suggestions attributed to him, though
aides might have spoken out of turn.

<TEXT>
BRITAIN yesterday won some sympathy from its European Community partners on
the political sensitivity of immigration, but got little support for its
refusal to stop checks on non-EC citizens entering the UK from elsewhere in
the Community after this year.
The controversial issue was discussed by EC foreign ministers, meeting in
Brussels. The discussion, however, did nothing to close the rift over the
issue.
The EC Commission and most EC states want all controls on travel within the
Community to end next year, whereas Britain contends that free travel rights
apply only to EC citizens. Controlling non-EC citizens requires,
necessarily, some checks on EC citizens.
Only Ireland, which effectively has a passport union with the UK, yesterday
expressed some oblique support for Britain's position.
Dublin is worried that, if it follows the EC majority in dropping intra-EC
controls while the UK does not, a new barrier will be erected between the UK
and Ireland.
Mr Douglas Hurd, Britain's foreign secretary, said London's difference with
its EC partners was long-standing and rooted in geography.
As an island nation, 'there are possibilities open to us to control
movements at airports and seaports which are not open to others', he said.
The UK has agreed to sign a convention strengthening the EC's external
frontier, at present stymied by a dispute with Spain over how it would
affect Gibraltar. But UK ministers say it might be years before such an
external control gave the UK the confidence to abandon checks on passengers
arriving from other points in the EC.

FT  12 MAY 92 / Unions urge OECD to act on unemployed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TRADE UNIONS in the world's leading industrialised countries have called on
governments to implement 'active structural policies' with a strong focus on
infrastructure investment to combat a sharp rise in unemployment.
Responding to a 5m increase in the jobless in the industrialised world over
the past two years, the trade union advisory committee of the 24-nation
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development said governments
should agree a range of policies to reduce unemployment at the next week's
OECD ministerial meeting in Paris and July's Group of Seven summit in
Munich.
It said the OECD should specify a programme of 'vigorous government action'
to deal with the problem. This should include more investment in
infrastructure, investment,assistance for local and regional development
spending, and policies to raise the purchasing power of the poor.
In recent years, the OECD ministerial meeting has tended to listen to and
then ignore the committee's views. Ministers are unlikely to accept the need
for more state spending to combat joblessness. Instead, they are expected to
promote 'active' labour market policies that shift the emphasis to
incentives for the unemployed to seek jobs.

FT  12 MAY 92 / Exchange tightens ruleson directors' share deals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TIGHTER RULES on share dealings by directors of listed companies, and on
dealings by their families and associates, were issued yesterday by the
London Stock Exchange after the share-rigging scandal surrounding the late
Robert Maxwell.
Had they been in force before, the rules would have prevented Maxwell and
Goldman Sachs, the US investment bank, from agreeing an options deal which
has subsequently been the subject of intense scrutiny by various regulatory
bodies. The deal gave Goldman the right to sell 15.6m shares in Maxwell
Communication Corporation (MCC) to Maxwell at a pre-agreed price.
The exchange did not name Maxwell or MCC when issuing the rules. However,
the changes are believed to have been provoked entirely by revelations about
dealings in MCC shares and options on MCC shares between the summer of 1990
and Maxwell's death last autumn.
The rules, to take effect on June 1, will force directors to disclose share
dealings by people, companies or other entities to which they are connected.
Previously only dealings by directors and their immediate families needed to
be disclosed.
The definition of 'connected' parties includes trusts in which directors or
their families have an interest. It also extends to associated companies -
those in which directors have at least a 20 per cent stake. The Stock
Exchange has taken the definition of 'connected' from section 346 of the
1985 Companies Act. This embraces, for instance, dealings by a director's
illegitimate children, though not by any children who are over 18.
In addition, dealings in options on a company's shares are to be brought
within the disclosure requirements for the first time. The new rules are
linked to the exchange's model code of dealings by directors, which forbids
directors to deal in the period before a results announcement.
Such a rule could have prevented Maxwell from selling a controversial 'put'
option over MCC shares to Goldman Sachs in August 1990, during the 'closed'
period ahead of a results announcement. The option, giving Goldman the right
to sell MCC shares to Maxwell at a predetermined price in effect put a floor
under the MCC share price during the autumn of 1990.
The exchange's new rules will not have the force of law, but breaches will
give the market authorities the power to suspend trading in a company's
shares or delist it altogether.

FT  12 MAY 92 / Pay rises at UK banks fall below rate of inflation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON and DAVID GOODHART
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PAY RISES in the UK banking sector have fallen to their lowest level since
the 1960s, with all the big banks settling for rises below the inflation
rate.
Yesterday it became clear that more than 28,000 clerical staff at the
Midland Bank will accept 3.5 per cent. Later this week, Barclays Bank is
expected to impose a 3 per cent rise.
Lloyds imposed a settlement of about 4 per cent earlier in the year -
although it is slightly higher when calculated over a whole year - and the
National Westminster about 2.5 per cent. Only the Bank of Scotland has
bucked this trend with an offer worth between 5 and 5.5 per cent.
The Midland offer, the last from the big four in the current pay round, is
being recommended by the executive of the Bifu banking union. It is worth a
total of 3.8 per cent on the pay bill because some peak-time workers are
getting a special extra rise to allow them to sign up for the bank pension
scheme.
Managerial pay, which also rose rapidly in the 1980s, is showing further
signs of restraint. According to the latest survey by PE International
management consultants, median salary rises for UK executives in the six
months to April stood at 5.5 per cent. This compares with median increases
of 10 per cent over the same period last year. The PE International survey
of managers' pay says that 11 out of 101 companies surveyed decided to defer
their pay reviews.
Employers and government ministers will be pleased to see that the
150,000-plus banking sector - where pay rises helped fuel white-collar pay
inflation of the late 1980s - is now acting as a drag, rather than a push,
on overall average earnings. Bank pay rises have even fallen below
first-quarter settlements in the manufacturing sector, which the
Confederation of British Industry calculated at 4.3 per cent.
However, pay analysts expect the latest average earnings figures, for
release by the Department of Employment on Thursday, to be holding up at
about 7 per cent. The earnings index figures are inflated by overtime and
other bonuses. The index is also slow to reflect falling inflation and
settlements because it takes into account all pay rises over the previous 12
months.
According to Mr Alistair Hatchett, of Incomes Data Services, the generosity
of the banks and other employers in the City of London in the late 1980s
caused big problems for many other employers of white-collar staff competing
in the same sector of the market.
The latest settlements reflect depressed conditions in the financial
services sector and some banks' provisions for bad debts. The rises are
about half the level of last year.
Similarly restrained rises are being awarded at smaller banks, according to
Bifu. The TSB yesterday offered its 17,000 non-managerial staff a 3.5 per
cent rise, which Bifu is recommending they accept, and Yorkshire Bank
negotiators will meet on Thursday to discuss an offer of 3.3 per cent.

FT  12 MAY 92 / Quarter of British Rail routes fail timetable targets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A QUARTER of all rail routes in Britain are failing to meet punctuality
targets set under the British Rail Passenger's Charter. Users of the worst
lines, however, will not qualify for compensation unless the poor
performance continues until the end of the year.
Figures published by BR yesterday are the first to show its performance
against targets on a line-by-line basis since the Passenger's Charter was
launched two months ago.
The worst route for punctuality has been Network SouthEast's London-Kent
coast line, on which only 73.2 per cent of peak-hour trains reached their
destination less than five minutes late. The target for the line is 83.3 per
cent.
For cancellations, equal worst are Network SouthEast's London-Tilbury and
Southend line and Regional Railways' north-east lines, both of which ran
96.6 per cent of scheduled trains. The target throughout BR is 99 per cent.
One surprise is the particularly poor performance of the InterCity sector,
customarily portrayed by BR as the jewel in its crown. All but two of
InterCity's seven routes fell short of punctuality targets, some widely. Of
the two lines that did pass the punctuality test, one - the Gatwick Express
 -failed on reliability.
The best line in Britain appears to be Regional Railways' North Wales line,
which scored 98.2 per cent on punctuality and 99.7 per cent on reliability.
InterCity's best performer is the Great Western route from London
Paddington. Network SouthEast's leader is London Euston-Northampton.
Under the charter, regular rail users will receive discounts on season
ticket renewals if their lines fail to meet performance targets by more than
a narrow margin over a 12-month period. However, monitoring began only in
January, so BR can avoid discounts if it brings performance up to par by
year end.
BR said yesterday that although 11 of its 44 routes had failed to meet
punctuality targets, only seven of the lines were performing badly enough to
trigger discounts if they failed to improve.

FT  12 MAY 92 / Queen drawn into Tory wrangle over Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY and DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE QUEEN was last night embroiled in the Conservative party's internal
wrangling over Britain's future in Europe as she prepared to deliver her
first ever address to the European Parliament in Strasbourg today.
A draft speech, reflecting a more positive UK approach to the Community, was
the focus of controversy as Buckingham Palace and Downing Street struggled
to maintain the monarch's aloofness from the party political fray.
In the original draft, the Queen was understood to dismiss differences in
national parliamentary traditions as 'insignificant' when set against the
European commitment to reconciliation and democracy. Her text was also said
to commend the European Parliament for playing 'an ever more important part'
in building common interests between the EC nations.
However, last night it looked likely that the final wording of the speech
will be altered to avoid offending Conservative Euro-sceptics, angry at the
erosion of British parliamentary sovereignty to EC institutions.
The last-minute flurry over the speech was a vivid reminder of continuing
political sensitivity surrounding Europe as Mr John Major attempts to
reposition his government as enthusiastic to Europe before taking up the EC
presidency in July.
Next week, however, the government must face down a backbench rebellion in
the Commons, opposing the integration of last December's Maastricht treaty
on closer European union into British law. Tory opponents of the Maastricht
deal, which includes enhanced powers for the European Parliament, are due to
meet tonight to plan their strategy.
Last night, the anti-federalist Bruges Group said that while it believed no
royal trespassing into the political arena was intended, it was concerned at
any suggestion that parliamentary differences were unimportant.
Mr William Cash, a leading Conservative Euro-sceptic, said it was 'utterly
irresponsible' of whoever had written the draft to portray the Queen as
indifferent to the significance of Britain's parliamentary traditions.
Government officials had said the speech had been written by the Queen's
private staff in consultation with the Foreign Office.
By early evening, however, Buckingham Palace was disputing that
interpretation, underlining that it was drafted in close collaboration with
the Foreign Office and Downing Street and bore a similar status to a Queen's
Speech to parliament. Later, Downing Street attempted to play down the
controversy by insisting that the reference to 'national parliaments' had
been taken out of context. 'There is no suggestion of trivialising national
parliaments,' it said.
The government had hoped the Queen's speech would defuse the row between the
UK and its EC partners over London's refusal to lift all immigration
controls. Yesterday, Mr Kenneth Clarke, the home secretary, warned Brussels
that the plan would provoke a growth in far right groups and threaten social
stability.

FT  12 MAY 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STOCK index futures appeared to lose some of their recent momentum, although
a squeeze late in the session helped the June contract end strongly on
fairly high turnover, writes Joel Kibazo.
The June contract on the FT-SE started the session at around 2,660, and
quickly ran ahead to reach the day's high of 2,772 by mid-morning. It then
lost the momentum and was seen to slide back, leading one trader to comment
that 'the FT-SE is begining to look a bit tired'.
Two-way business characterised the afternoon session, with Wall Street said
to have had no influence on June, although a squeeze in the last few minutes
of the session helped June end firmly.
June eventually closed at 2,764, around 20 points above its estimated fair
value premium to cash which yesterday fell to about 8. Turnover was a
healthy 7,142 contracts.
The traded options market witnessed a quieter session, and turnover at
30,418 was just ahead of the break-even level of the market.
The FT-SE contract traded 9,638 lots. Hanson was the busiest stock option
with a total of 4,649 contracts. The May 240 calls were particularly busy.
This was followed by Ladbroke on 2,000 lots.

FT  12 MAY 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Speculative issues
feature as Nikkei continues to rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Nikkei average continued its upward trend yesterday, and active buying
of speculative issues by dealers was noted, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The index finished 232.14 ahead at 18,608.09 after opening at the session's
low of 18,407.87 and reaching the day's high of 18,666.70 later in the
morning.
Volume contracted from 450m shares to 380m, while advances outnumbered
declines by 855 to 166, with 118 issues remaining unchanged. The Topix index
of all first section stocks added 13.83 at 1,388.21, but in London the
ISE/Nikkei 50 index eased 2.23 to 1,111.89.
Arbitrage-related trading and short-term buying of speculative 'theme'
stocks by dealers led the activity. Institutional investors remained on the
sidelines, while some life insurers were seen taking profits in small lots.
Traders said some investors were buying stocks with favourable earnings
prospects for the current fiscal year to March 1993, ahead of the corporate
earnings season which is due to start in the next few weeks.
Mr Masami Okuma at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew said: 'Trading interest will shift
from speculative issues to companies' official forecasts (for the current
year) which will be announced with last year's results.'
A total of 25 issues attained new highs for the year. Okamoto, the condom
maker, and the most active issue of the day, moved up Y10 to Y1,390 on the
'bio-technology theme'. Morinaga Milk appreciated Y7 to Y847 and Meiji Milk
Products jumped Y54 to Y944.
Brokerages gained ground as investors were encouraged by the recent increase
in market volume. Nomura Securities moved ahead Y40 to Y1,440 and Daiwa
Securities put on Y19 to Y859.
High-technology stocks, which advanced last week on bargain hunting, were
mixed, as some institutional investors were seen taking profits. Those to
weaken included Hitachi, which ended Y16 down at Y854, and Matsushita, Y30
cheaper at Y1,400.
Sekisui Chemical dropped Y179 to Y921 on reports that it had suffered
unrealised losses of Y60bn due to stock investments by one of its
subsidiaries.
In Osaka, broad-based buying by foreigners and investment trusts pushed the
OSE average up 320.04 to 21,213.74 in volume of 26.1m shares. Shimano, the
bicycle parts manufacturer, climbed Y130 to Y1,660 on short-term buying. Ono
Pharmaceutical receded Y30 to Y6,350 on profit-taking.
Roundup
THE LOWEST close for six months was recorded by Taiwan, Bangkok saw its
biggest single-day gain since February 1991, and Bombay lost 7.5 per cent.
Other Pacific Rim markets were mixed yesterday, while Manila was closed for
the presidential election.
TAIWAN fell steeply after the central bank raised the rediscount rate at the
weekend. The weighted index lost 160.80, or 3.6 per cent, to 4,268.17 in
TDollars 17.8bn turnover.
The financial sector led the retreat, followed by paper, machinery, cement,
food and textile shares.
BANGKOK improved after opposition groups called off anti-government
protests. The SET index rallied 41.81, or 5.70 per cent, to 774.70 in
turnover of Bt7.54bn.
Bangkok Bank advanced Bt32 to Bt712 and Bangkok Land put on Bt14 to Bt160.
BOMBAY plunged as rumours of a securities scandal grew. The BSE index lost
237.95 to 3,420.05.
SEOUL declined for the fifth consecutive session. The index gave up 7.10 to
587.52 in turnover of Won326bn. Electronics issues were weaker, with Trigem
Computer down Won600 to Won14,000. Dongshin Pharmaceutical rose Won1,000 to
Won25,700 on good earnings forecasts.
HONG KONG closed higher after early losses. The Hang Seng index gained 24.15
to 5,632.34 in HKDollars 3.56bn turnover.
Interest was mainly seen in second and third-line stocks, particularly
Cheung Kong and Sun Hung Kai Properties after their announcement of
joint-venture projects in China. Elsewhere, HSBC Holdings rose 75 cents to
HKDollars 4.25.
SINGAPORE fell on profit-taking. The Straits Times Industrial index lost
14.23 to 1,459.54 in turnover of SDollars 90m.
Singapore Press Holdings Foreign and DBS Bank Foreign shed 50 and 40 cents
respectively to SDollars 12.90 and SDollars 13.40.
KUALA LUMPUR's composite index slipped 1.74 to 603.97 in turnover of
MDollars 67.8m. Resorts World declined 20 cents to MDollars 11.40 and
Malayan Banking lost 5 cents to MDollars 8.
AUSTRALIA eased afresh after the government said that it was raising its
budget deficit forecast. The All Ordinaries index dipped 1.6 to 1,662.1 in
turnover of ADollars 204.8m.
NEW ZEALAND's capital index rose 1.78 to 1,472.34 in turnover of NZDollars
18.6m.

FT  12 MAY 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): International investors lift
Paris and Zurich
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ACCLAIM for Paris, second-line speculation in Frankfurt and more new highs
in Zurich competed for attention yesterday, writes Our Markets Staff.
PARIS continued to rise as international investors took the view that after
the UK, France offered the best potential in Europe this year. Several
brokers expect the CAC-40 index to reach 2,300 before the end of 1992. The
index closed 14.09 higher at 2,077.49, another 1992 high, in good turnover
of FFr3bn.
Thursday's base rate cuts failed to sustain financials, as Paribas fell
FFr11.90 to FFr435. Suez was the day's most active share, dropping FFr2.80
to FFr343.20.
Schneider rose FFr38 to FFr745 while its subsidiary Merlin-Gerin jumped
FFr33 or 6 per cent to FFr582 following a company roadshow. Pernod Ricard,
the drinks company, rose FFr47 to FFr1,645 on a UK newspaper article which
suggested that Grand Met might make a bid. A big UK buy order pushed
Lyonnaise/Dumez up FFr12 to FFr571.
Stock in Hachette was on offer as the price fell FFr7.40 or 5 per cent to
FFr141. MMB, the holding company which controls Hachette, was suspended
pending an announcement.
FRANKFURT stayed quiet, but remarkably stable given high interest rates,
strike worries and high money supply growth. The DAX index closed 4.85
higher at 1,753.03 after a 1.30 rise to 707.92 in the FAZ at midsession.
Turnover rose from DM5bn to DM6.5bn. Continental, the tyre company, traded
in an above-average DM46m as it fell DM11 to DM260. Weekend stories about a
pending Conti rights issue of up to DM200m were revised yesterday: Conti
said it wanted to create DM150m of new capital.
However, Mr Hans Peter Wodniok of James Capel in Frankfurt said that while
Pirelli SpA had officially pulled out as a bidder for Conti, there had still
been speculation on an eventual Pirelli offer.
The prospect of a Conti share issue made this highly unlikely, speculation
cooled yesterday and the Conti shares fell; Capel's estimate of the
intrinsic worth of the shares is DM200, indicating prospective current year
and 1993 p/e's of 33 and 18 respectively.
MILAN was driven lower by Pirelli's bigger-than-expected 1991 loss,
announced late on Friday, and by fears that more rights issues were on the
way. The Comit index fell through 490, regarded as an important support
level, and closed 5.28 lower at 488.05, a new 1992 low. Turnover was
estimated between L80bn-L100bn after Friday's L112.7bn.
Pirelli dropped L47 or 3.3 per cent to L1,382 at the official fixing. But
the Conti rights issue story pushed the price down to L1,355 after hours on
fears that Pirelli would subscribe to its 40 per cent share in order not to
dilute its stake, a move it could barely afford.
Generali was also weak, losing L390 or 1.3 per cent to L28,800 despite
efforts by Mediobanca to support the price. Ras savings shares, which failed
to be fixed on Friday due to a trading imbalance, slumped L2,780 or 21 per
cent to L10,480 as the fallout of its badly-timed rights issue continued.
Stefanel, which has also announced a rights issue, fell L80 to L3,690.
ZURICH continued to enjoy the rewards of a good blue chip results season,
the SMI index rising 14.5 to a new high of 1,963.6 for the year.
The chemical group, Sandoz, and major banks led the gains. Sandoz
certificates topping the active list as they rose SFr130 to SFr2,880.
Dealers said Sandoz had lagged behind the market and was now catching up
with Ciba-Geigy and Roche.
AMSTERDAM's CBS Tendency index advanced 0.3 to 130.4. Unilever and Royal
Dutch both attracted strong overseas interest ahead of first quarter results
due out later this week, rising Fl 3.20 to Fl 193.20 and Fl 1.20 to Fl 152
respectively.
KLM was active in spite of denying weekend reports that an American airline
might take a minority stake in the Dutch carrier. It closed up 90 cents at
Fl 40.40, but off the day's high of Fl 40.60 with strong options related
trading also noted.
STOCKHOLM was again led higher by Volvo's strength and lower domestic
interest rates. The Affarsvarlden General Index rose 4.8 to 1,014.5 as
turnover eased to SKr677m from SKr853m.
Volvo B unrestricted shares gained SKr6 to SKr451, on continued rumours of
an early merger with Renault.
VIENNA eased in low volume. The ATX index lost 1.18 to 970.65. Bank Austria
preference shares fell Sch12 to Sch482 while its ordinary shares were
unchanged at Sch1,040 after the bank last week invited preference
shareholders to convert their shares into ordinaries.
MADRID's general index closed up 4.03 at 259.04 in turnover of Pta22bn. UK
institutional buying was seen in blue chips while optimism that there would
only be a small rise in Thursday's inflation figures was an added boost.

FT  12 MAY 92 / World Stock Markets: Global equities take turn for the
better
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM COCHRANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Global equities took a turn for the better last week, with the FT-Actuaries
World Index gaining 2.1 per cent, but there were reservations about the
prime component in the equation.
Japan's rise of 4.6 per cent fell marginally short of the week's top
performer, South Africa, comparatively unimportant to the World Index
structure with an equity market capitalisation only 5 per cent of the
Japanese level.
Morgan Stanley, which was not enthusiastic about Japanese equities a month
ago, has not changed its opinion. 'We are in a holding pattern now,' says Mr
David Roche, its London strategist, 'but we think there will be another leg
down.'
In spite of domestic arguments based on the fall in price/earnings ratios,
Mr Roche thinks Tokyo is still very expensive in p/e terms. He says that
what is happening in the domestic economy will have recessionary, if not
deflationary, consequences.
In Europe, Switzerland came out fractionally better than Sweden at the top
of the table, reporting strong foreign buying of its chemical/pharmaceutical
blue chips. However, the Scandinavian countries were impressive en bloc,
with a 3.6 per cent gain, or double that of Europe as a whole.
Mr David Longmuir of James Capel says that although Finland made a good
start to last week with the removal of its stamp duty, the action was in
Norway and Sweden.
Norway was strong across the board, having seen good domestic buying over
the past two or three weeks. Support of Norsk Hydro based on aluminium and
oil prices was followed by other industrials, and then the shipping sector.
Sweden enjoyed a strong mix of foreign and domestic buying, led by
engineering companies seen as cyclical recovery situations. While Norway may
be at risk of profit-taking, says Mr Longmuir, demand for Swedish stocks
seems far from satisfied.

FT  12 MAY 92 / Commodities and Agriculture (Farmer's Viewpoint): Milking
profits in the Mediterranean sunshine - Dairy producers are cashing in on
many natural and political advantages in Italy's Po valley
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID RICHARDSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHE WAS one of the biggest dairy cows I have ever seen. From her tail to her
shoulders she stood over five feet tall, and the top of her great head was
level with mine. For the record, I am over six feet.
Last week she was not being milked. Indeed, her udder was dry because she
was heavily pregnant with her fifth calf. In her fourth lactation she gave
13,600 litres of milk. Her name was Del Santo Fulvia, and she was one of the
best cows in an outstanding herd of Holstein Friesians on a dairy farm a few
kilometres south of Milan.
The top yielder in the herd, I was told, had given 16,000 litres in a
one-year lactation, and the herd average was 9,600 litres. Moreover, most of
the dairy herds in this part of the Po Valley are averaging more than 8,000
litres per lactation. To put those figures into perspective, the average
yield of British dairy herds is between 5,500 and 6,000 litres, and those of
Holland around 7,000 litres. Furthermore, the average yield of all the dairy
herds in Italy is down at about the same level as the UK.
So, why is the Po Valley so special, and how is it that this area alone is
responsible for 70 per cent of Italy's milk production?
The answer is a combination of factors, chief among which are the breeding
and genetics of the cows, the way they are managed and the diets they are
fed. For the origins of the present Po Valley dairy herd owe as much to
North America as to Europe.
When the qualities of the black-and-white cows that had been developed over
generations in the north Holland province of Friesland were recognised by
the farmers of other countries at the turn of the century, they began to be
exported all over the world. In Europe, most breeders continued to favour
the traditional Dutch type of cow, which gave a good milk yield but whose
surplus male calves, not needed for breeding, were also suitable for beef.
The Dutch Friesian was the ultimate dual-purpose animal.
In America and Canada, however, farmers selected animals for milk yield
alone, and, although the black-and-white colour remained, the conformation
and size of the North American Holstein Friesian gradually became very
different from that of its Dutch ancestors. So, too, did its ability to
produce large quantities of milk.
Meanwhile, most British dairy farmers continued with their meatier
dual-purpose animals. But in the Po Valley, uniquely in Europe, dairy
farmers decided to follow the American pattern and in 1929 imported the
first Holstein Friesian bull to come back across the Atlantic. The result is
the present high milking-capacity of their cows, which, incidentally, are
little use for beef. Indeed, Italy now imports many of its beef animals, as
calves, from France. Nevertheless, in the pursuit of yield and profit other
European farmers are now attempting to follow the US and the Po Valley
farmers' example.
How successful they will be is open to conjecture. For another of the
factors that has enabled these northern Italian dairy farmers to achieve
such production is the fact that, like Californian dairymen, they do not
allow their cows to graze. Instead, in order to ensure that the animals
receive the optimum diet for maximum milk-production every day of the year,
they are kept in open concrete yards and have their specially formulated
feed delivered to them.
Every effort is made to make the cows as comfortable as possible and, during
the hot summer months, massive electric fans blow across the feeding areas
to cool their backs as they feed.
To achieve maximum yields, it is necessary for the cows to eat as much of
the milk-making fodder as possible. Anything that might inhibit this high
intake has to be avoided - hence, the crude air-conditioning. But whether
such conditions could economically be reproduced in northern Europe's
harsher climates remains to be seen.
Similarly, the basic vegetable diet the cows receive requires a warmer
climate in which to grow than that which we normally get in countries like
Britain. It is based on maize and Lucerne, or, as the Americans call them,
corn and alfalfa. For this, too, is copied from North America. Both fodder
crops need hot summers and plenty of irrigation in order to produce the most
economic yields and the best quality for the promotion of milk-production.
But the Po Valley is ideally situated. The Mediterranean sun shines reliably
most of the summer and melting Alpine snow fills a series of enormous lakes
that overflow down a network of rivers and converge to make the mighty Po.
The whole valley, which is 600 km (370 miles) long and 200 km wide at the
river's mouth, centred on the eastern Italian port of Ravenna, is composed
of rich, deep, fertile, alluvial soil. Italians have been building
irrigation canals across it for 1,000 years and today the comprehensive
network allows almost every farmer in the valley to flood-irrigate his
crops.
In addition to all these natural advantages, however, Italian dairy farmers
also appear to have some political ones. For, although milk quotas to reduce
production and surpluses were introduced in the European Community eight
years ago, they have still not been applied in Italy.
Questioned as to why this is so, farmers complain that the government is
corrupt and that the whole situation is chaotic. They then go on to say that
the original milk quota allocated to Italy represented only 38 per cent of
domestic need and that consumption has risen since then.
They feel, therefore, that they are justified in producing at least 10 per
cent more than their national quota allows, and see no inconsistency in the
fact that the quota system was intended to deal with over-production in the
EC as a whole.
In any event, eight years on, the milk quota system remains to be imposed in
Italy, and, in the meantime, farmers are happily maximising their production
and paying no super-levy - the punitive fine imposed on farmers in other
countries of the EC if they exceed the permitted amount. And they are doing
it, apparently, without too much hassle from Brussels.
It made me wonder if a touch of Italian-style chaos in regulation-ridden
Britain would not be preferable to our national compulsion to obey rules. If
the experience of the farmers in the Po Valley is any guide, it would
certainly be more profitable.

FT  12 MAY 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Deals likely this year for
Indonesia's Dollars 15bn gas field
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM KEELING

<DATELINE>
   JAKARTA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NEGOTIATIONS FOR the development of the giant Natuna gas field, which would
carry Indonesia's liquefied natural gas industry into the next century,
should be completed this year, industry officials have said.
The Natuna field has reserves estimated at 45 trillion (million million)
cubic feet and is situated north-east of Natuna island in the South China
Sea. Esso Indonesia has a 50 per cent interest in the field, with Pertamina,
Indonesia's state-owned oil and gas company, holding an equal stake.
Development of the field, which would take eight years, is expected to cost
about USDollars 15bn. More than half the cost is accounted for by the heavy
platforms and technology required to handle the gas, which has a 70 per cent
carbon dioxide content.
Indonesia must bring the field on stream if it is successfully to
renegotiate long-term LNG export contracts with Japan, which begin to expire
in 1998. The contracts are supplied by the Arun field off north Sumatra but
the latter has insufficient reserves to guarantee further 20 year contracts.
An industry executive close to the negotiations said government officials
accepted that an agreement had 'to be concluded soon for Natuna to come on
stream by 1999. They recognise that Indonesia must catch the market whilst
it still needs them'.
'Pertamina cannot raise the money, and government officials say Pertamina
may reduce its stake in Natuna to 10 per cent. Whoever takes the 40 per cent
will be expected to carry Pertamina's financing obligations,' the executive
added.'
Companies which have shown an interest in taking a stake in Natuna include
Nissho Iwai, Mitsui, Mitsubishi and Mobil, the executive said.
Negotiations between Pertamina and Esso include whether to build a new LNG
processing plant on Natuna island, or to construct a pipeline and use
existing facilities at Lhokseumawe, North Sumatra.
Indonesia is the world's largest producer of LNG with exports in 1990 valued
at USDollars 4bn. About 85 per cent of exports go to Japan, with other
customers including Taiwan and South Korea.
A gas field with reserves of about 4.5 trillion cu ft has been found by
Asamera Oil Indonesia off the north coast of Sumatra, industry officials
say.
The reserve figures are based upon preliminary geological test data received
by the Indonesian authorities and further tests are planned. Asamera, a
subsidiary of Gulf Canada Resources, has not officially announced the size
of the find but has said 'drilling indications are encouraging'.
The find is close to the Arun field which currently feeds the six-train LNG
facilities at Lhokseumawe.
Asamera hold a 50 per cent stake in the 'Block A' contract area where the
field is located. The company recently assigned the remaining interest to
Aceh Gas and Oil, a Japanese consortium led by Japex.
Under the deal, Aceh must fund the first USD70M of an on-going exploration
and development programme. This includes the drilling of a further three
exploratory wells later this year.

FT  12 MAY 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Tin price breaks Dollars 6,000
barrier
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TIN'S PRICE surged to the highest level for 18 months and broke decisively
through the Dollars 6,000 a tonne barrier on the London Metal Exchange
yesterday in a delayed reaction to news last Friday that Brazil, the world's
biggest producer, was to cut output in the hope that this would boost
prices.
Analysts and traders suggested, however, that the price would meet
substantial resistance at Dollars 6,200 a tonne. 'This is not the start of a
major bull market for tin, perhaps we will get that at the end of this year
or next year,' said Mr Robin Bhar, analyst at Carr Kitcatt &amp; Aitken, part of
the Banque Indosuez Group.
He suggested the ingredients for tin's rise from recent low levels of about
Dollars 5,500 a tonne had been evident for some weeks. The market had been
short of good brands from Brazil and Malaysia so 'it looks as if the market
can hold on to these gains'. Mr Bhar pointed out that there was ample supply
of low and medium-grade tin concentrates (an intermediate material)
available but there was a shortage of high-quality concentrate which many
smelters needed.
Tin for immediate delivery closed at Dollars 6,045 a tonne on the LME last
night, up Dollars 67.50 from Friday's close. Three-month tin rose Dollars 60
to Dollars 6,042.50 a tonne.
Brazil's intentions were outlined by Mr Mauricio Pinto da Silva, mining
division export manager of Paranapanema, the state-owned Brazilian tin
group, biggest of its kind in the world. He told a Metal Bulletin conference
in Phuket, Thailand: 'We want to see lower production to help realise our
aims of getting more remunerative but stable prices.'
Paranapanema's chief executive, Mr Samuel Hanan, said that Brazil's tin
production might fall to 25,000 tonnes in 1992 compared with 29,500 last
year and its peak in 1989 of 50,200 tonnes.
The conference also heard that Bolivia's output would fall to between 13,000
and 15,000 tonnes a year from 16,700 in 1991 while Malaysian production was
likely to slip below 20,000 tonnes from 20,710 last year. However,
Portugal's output is set to rise from 8,500 to 10,000 tonnes.
Carr Kitcatt's Mr Bhar suggested yesterday that demand for tin - the metal
is mainly used in tin plate, solder and chemicals - was probably stagnating
at best and prices would depend on suppliers' willingness to continue output
cuts. Demand for tin this year was likely to remain at the 1991 level of
180,000 tonnes while supply might fall by 5,000 to 10,000 tonnes to 155,000
to 160,000 tonnes.
He said prices would be held back by the large stockpile overhanging the
market - down from about 44,000 tonnes to 38,000 tonnes since the begining
of this year - and the fact that the US authorities would sell 12,000 tonnes
from their stocks this fiscal year.
The zinc market was more or less in balance in the first quarter of 1992 but
there was a substantial surplus of lead, according to the International Lead
and Zinc Study Group.
It said refined lead production was 1.4 per cent up on the same months of
1991 at 1.121m tonnes while consumption rose by only 0.6 per cent to 1.097m
tonnes. Refined zinc production was up 4.4 per cent to 1.357m tonnes and
consumption rose 2.9 per cent to 1.358m tonnes.

FT  12 MAY 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Orissa to move up Indian sugar
league

   CALCUTTA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE SETTING up of a modern sugar factory at the Kalahandi district of Orissa
by Western India Sugar and Chemical Industries will mark the beginning of
the development of the eastern Indian state as an important producer of
sugar.
Orissa's sugar production has so far has remained insignificant in spite of
its having large tracts of well drained land with good humus and high
phosphate and potassium levels. It has only about 50,000 hectares under
sugar-cane and produces just 20,000 tonnes of sugar a year out of India's
12m-tonne total.
According to soil scientists, however, Kalahandi and some other parts of
Orissa could grow sugar-cane of the quality found in Maharashtra, the
country's largest sugar producing state. Encouraged by this prospect, a
number of established sugar producers from the west and the south have taken
over the few existing factories in Orissa for modernisation and expansion or
acquired licences to set up new units.
The Western India sugar plant, with a capacity to crush 2,500 tonnes of cane
a day, will start commercial production in October 1993, coinciding with the
beginning of the sugar season, according to Mr BB Nagpal. The crushing
capacity of the unit will be raised to 5,000 tonnes a day in two phases by
1995. The company will use the by-product molasses to produce industrial
alcohol and downstream chemicals.
Promotion of sugar-cane cultivation and creation of sugar manufacturing
capacity in non-traditional areas are called for if India is to remain a
regular sugar exporter. According to an official report domestic consumption
of sugar by 1994-95 will be 13.27m tonnes, when production is expected to be
13.41m tonnes. New capacity has to be created if significant export levels
are to be maintained.

London's robusta COFFEE managed to hold the gains established by midday,
rising by Dollars 26 in near July to close at its high of Dollars 701 a
tonne. Dealers said the market had become heavily oversold during the recent
fall to the lowest levels for around 22 years, so the upward correction was
not unexpected. New York arabicas were also ahead at midday. Dealers were
keeping one eye on a meeting in Brazil between the government and the
private sector. Last week, the Brazilian Federation of Coffee Exporters said
it would seek emergency measures to boost prices, and would also propose
co-ordinating with other coffee nations. Costa Rica confirmed that it was
considering taking some form of measures as a gesture of protest. 'All this
may lift the market for a few weeks, but the oversupply is still going to be
there,' one London dealer said. London COCOA prices closed mixed after
trading in a Pounds 10 range. 'There's really nothing you can say about
today, other than there was less origin selling,' one dealer said. The
possibility of further sales later this week, however, was dampening any
possibility of a rally.

FT  12 MAY 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: EC shows it is ready to compete
for grain exports
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REUTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE EUROPEAN Community has shown that it will be ready to compete with the
US and other leading grain exporters when the 1992-93 season starts in July,
European traders said yesterday, reports Reuter.
Last week the EC's cereals management committee announced that it would open
tenders on June 3 to export 3.1m tonnes of grain out of intervention stores
in July and August.
'We like to make an early start to the export season,' an EC grain official
in Brussels said. The sales from intervention will help to ensure the flow
of shipments until EC new crop supplies arrive.
The EC usually harvests its wheat crop in August, whereas the US starts to
export in June.
'Brussels has shown it is ready to snap up any early export business,' a
German grain manager said.
Germany, which holds nearly half of EC grain intervention stocks, was
allocated 1.4m tonnes of wheat, barley and rye at last week's tenders.
'The tenders bridge the gap between the old and new crops,' a UK agriculture
official said, adding they were customary.
They will also help to trim record EC intervention stocks and clear storage
space for new crop grain. EC intervention stocks are expected to total some
28m tonnes at the end of June, up from 18.7m a year earlier. The surplus has
been swelled by delays in shipments to the Commonwealth of Independent
States and by a huge 1991 crop of just over 180.5m tonnes, including the
former East Germany, up from 169.7m in 1990.
Stocks rose despite increased intervention exports accounting for about a
third of total exports, their highest ever share, traders said.
Last week's intervention tenders are only a guideline. 'The market is
sensitive to such signals so the volumes were a compromise,' the EC official
said, adding they could later be raised according to demand. Bigger volumes
could have depressed the new crop market.
The price outlook is mildly bearish because of a lack of buyers and the
prospect of a recovery in the world wheat crop, traders said, adding that
dry weather could quickly change the scenario.

FT  12 MAY 92 / International Capital Markets: BIS in detailed analysis of
futures trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE MOST detailed analysis yet of the escalation of worldwide trading in
derivatives is published today by the Basle-based Bank for International
Settlements. It's conclusion: that the 'pyramiding of transactions in
derivatives', with different markets feeding off each other in an upward
spiral of trading volume, has created a complex network of linkages between
derivative and cash markets around the world.
The BIS study, contained in its latest quarterly report on international
financing, reveals:
While open interest in exchange-traded instruments has jumped by 500 per
cent in the past five years, the value of outstanding currency and interest
rates swaps has expanded eightfold.
Activity in Europe has soared as trading in the US has levelled off. Last
year, 200m derivatives were traded on US exchanges, hardly different from
the 198m of two years before. By contrast, European exchanges traded 84m
contracts, up from 49m in 1989.
Arbitrage activity between markets has brought pricing of different
instruments closer, at the same time prompting an explosion of trading
volume. 'Swaps, for instance, have linked the bond markets in different
currencies more closely together,' said the BIS.
Banks have become the most significant participants in some markets,
particular those in short-term interest rates, the BIS says. This reflects
the development of derivatives, especially swaps, which in the mid-1980s
were dependent on arbitrage-related trading. 'Over time interest rate swaps
have become a more general instrument of risk management, especially for
financial institutions, and to some extent have replaced more traditional
interbank activity.'
In the first half of 1991, 44 per cent of the new interest rate swaps
completed were between banks, up from 30 per cent at the end of 1987. At the
same time, banks now account for around two-thirds of trading in some
short-term interest rate contracts in the US.

<TEXT>
A POLISH government bond issue is for the first time to be available to
foreign investors. The bonds, maturing after three years, go on sale on
August 3.
Interest will be linked to the yield on three-month Polish treasury bills
plus 10 per cent. This would mean 51 per cent compared to the expected
year-end inflation rate of 45 per cent.
Officials said foreign investors would be able to repatriate their earnings
although final regulations providing for this have yet to be signed.
Interest on the bonds is to be paid quarterly and they are to be traded on
Warsaw's computerised stock exchange.
The total value of the three-year bond issue is 7,000bn zlotys (Dollars
512m).
This issue is to be accompanied by one-year bonds, available only to Poles
and linked to inflation plus 5 per cent. This issue, on sale on June 1, has
a value of 8,000bn zlotys.
The two issues, are designed to finance partially Poland's budget deficit
which is expected to reach 65,500bn zlotys this year.

NORWAY feels it is too early to reprivatise Christiania Bank and Fokus Bank,
two of the country's three biggest banks, taken over by the state last year,
writes Karen Fossli in Oslo.
The finance ministry said that although it was the government's aim to put
the banks back into the private sector, it was too early to fix a strategy
for privatisation.
'Privatisation will take place when the value of the banks can be fixed with
greater certainty than there is today,' the ministry said.
Last week, the top three banks presented their results for the first three
months of 1992 which showed reduced credit losses, slightly improved
earnings and lower operating costs.

FT  12 MAY 92 / International Capital Markets: IBM seeks Dollars 500m in
five-year deal
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
INTERNATIONAL Business Machines (IBM), the large computer group, is seeking
a Dollars 500m, five-year loan from European banks.
The company said the complex structured deal, which was being arranged by
Citibank using a Cayman Islands corporation, would be used 'to finance
operations and for some customer financing'.
The money was being raised by IBM France, and the sophisticated financing
arrangement was 'designed to ensure that IBM gets the lowest possible cost
of funds', the company said.
IBM's long-term debt rating was downgraded in March by Moody's Investors
Service, a leading credit rating agency, from Aaa to Aa2. S&amp;P, another
rating agency, has kept its top AAA rating for IBM, but has had the company
on 'negative outlook' since last August.
However, IBM claims the complex method of financing is not related to
Moody's downgrading of IBM's credit rating and does not signal a change of
approach to raising funds.
The official borrower is Abacus (Number One), a Cayman Island special
purpose vehicle. Abacus is raising a five-year senior secured loan, where
the Dollars 500m principal amount is fully collateralised by a five-year
zero-coupon bond issued by a triple-A rated OECD sovereign or supranational
entity.
Citibank said it had structured the transaction so that Abacus's interest
payment obligations would be serviced by interest payments from a separate
loan between Citibank and IBM France.
The interest margin on the loan is 37.5 basis points over the London
interbank offered rate (Libor). Fees range from 30 basis points for senior
managers lending Dollars 40m to 12.5 basis points for participations of
Dollars 10m.
IBM said the financing was not related to the company's pledge to make a
Dollars 100m equity investment in Groupe Bull, the French state-owned
computer maker.
Citibank expected the financing to be completed by the end of May.

ATLAS COPCO, Europe's largest air compressor manufacturer, has reported a 16
per cent improvement in profits after financial items to SKr292m (Dollars
49.2m) for the first three months of the year. Sales rose by 8 per cent to
SKr3.83bn.
Operating profits after depreciation increased 33 per cent against the same
period of 1991 to SKr334m. Restructuring costs in the company's construction
and mining technique area totalling SKr65m were set against profits.
The company's recovery in the first quarter follows a 28 per cent drop in
profits last year to SKr910m.
Atlas Copco said it expected an improvement of earnings this year so long as
there was no further decline in business conditions.
However, the company warned that its order bookings remained weak during the
first quarter, although the order trend had levelled out.
The most successful area of activity was in the construction and mining
technique division with an operating profit after depreciation of SKr72m,
compared with a SKr25m loss in the first three months of last year.
However, there was a slide in operating profits after depreciation in the
industrial technique division to SKr46m from SKr70m.
In compressors the company's operating profits after depreciation fell
slightly to SKr261m from SKr266m.

<TEXT>
SEAT, the Spanish car manufacturer owned by Volkswagen, raised its 1991
post-tax profits by 34.7 per cent to Pta6.7bn (Dollars 65m), thanks largely
to the increased export market provided by German reunification.
Sales to Germany, which replaced Italy as Seat's main foreign client, rose
from 57,000 units in 1990 to 105,000 last year.
'Seat successfully saw the opportunity of the new unified Germany,' said Mr
Eberhard Muller, the group's finance director.
Later this year, Volkswagen will switch all manufacturing of its Polo car to
Seat's plant in Pamplona, where production will be increased to 1,200 units
a day, double the number at the beginning of last year.
Exports overall were up by 18.8 per cent to 438,000 units against an 8.4 per
cent drop to 178,000 units in the domestic market. Income from sales
increased by 16.8 per cent to Pta587.7bn and for the first time in Seat's
history income from exports overtook the revenue earned in Spain.
The Seat group doubled its investment last year to Pta120bn, Pta69bn of
which was spent on a new plant near Barcelona which will enter full
production, building Seat's new Toledo model, early next year.

FT  12 MAY 92 / International Capital Markets: Liffe to launch Eurolire
futures contract today
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LIFFE, the London futures and options exchange, will today launch the first
futures contract on Eurolire interest rates, hoping to harness the rapid
growth of the international money market in the Italian currency.
The new contract is similar in design to Liffe's existing three-month
futures on the dollar, sterling, Ecu, Swiss franc and D-Mark interest rates.
Each contact is valued at L1,000m (Dollars 800,000) with eleven firms acting
as designated brokers, undertaking to quote a price. The firms are not
obliged to make a market, but Liffe said that the designated broker system
would contribute to liquidity.
According to Bank for International Settlements figures, Eurolire deposits -
lire deposits held outside Italy - grew from around Dollars 30bn equivalent
in 1989 to Dollars 100bn last year.
The growth of the deposits market has spurred the development of money
market instruments such as swaps, forward foreign exchange contracts and
forward rate agreements. Earlier this year the Italian government removed a
30 per cent withholding tax on interbank deposits, and this has increased
cash trading volume and narrowed dealing spreads.
Eurolire interest rates are volatile compared with most other big trading
currencies. Liffe hopes this will stimulate demand for the new contract.
Until now, financial institutions have bought tailored, over-the-counter
derivative financial products rather than exchange-traded contracts to hedge
lire exposures.
Mr Roger Barton, business development director at Liffe, said the exchange
did not have a target for turnover of the new contract. However, he said
Liffe would be happy with a turnover of 3,000 to 5,000 contracts a day.
The cost of developing the new contact was relatively low since the
specifications are close to existing interest rate futures.
Last week Liffe suspended its future on the FTSE Eurotrack index of 100
leading European equities because the contract had an average daily volume
of only 13 contracts.
Liffe last week completed an oversubscribed rights issue designed to promote
the trading of the Eurolire and other short-dated interest rate contracts.
The new 'E' shares grant holders the right to trade all but the exchange's
most popular contracts. This should make them less expensive than existing
shares, and so encourage traders to start dealing in the exchange's new
contracts.

<TEXT>
METRA, the Finnish industrial conglomerate, announced yesterday a FM203m
(Dollars 45.65m) loss after financial items for its 1991-1992 financial year
which ended on February 29. This contrasts with a FM340m profit for the
previous financial year.
However, group sales grew 11 per cent to FM9.83bn from FM8.88bn over the
same period. The board proposes a dividend of FM2 per share for the
1991-1992 financial year compared with FM2.80 for the previous 12 months.
Metra said it was also going ahead with a FM60m share issue to raise capital
for the strengthening of its core businesses and leading investments,
including acquisitions. A total of 3m new shares is to be available at a
nominal value of FM20 per share.
Metra blamed its loss on a more severe business downturn, particularly in
Finland, than had been forecast. This hit the group's building materials
business. Restructuring measures, however, are expected to return that part
of Metra's activity to profitability by 1993.
However Sanitec, the group's bathroom fittings division, recorded
substantial growth in the German market, with a fall in demand in
Scandinavia. The locks and lock systems business was also hit by falling
demand, except in Germany, and Metra said further moves were planned to
adjust to this.
The Wartsila diesel operation enjoyed an improved performance, with 43 per
cent growth in net sales to SKr3.3bn (Dollars 556m) from SKr2.3bn, and a 13
per cent growth in operating profits to SKr177m. Metra accounts for about 20
per cent of the world market for medium-speed marine engines and diesel
power plants over 1MW capacity. It forecast a rise in sales in the next
financial year to FM4.6bn.
The group said expected restructuring measures in its building materials and
locks and lock systems manufacture should make a 'favourable impact' on
future performance.

FT  12 MAY 92 / International Company News: Matsushita orders retail
shake-up / Examining the Japanese group's restructuring plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Matsushita Electric Industrial, Japan's leading consumer electronics group
which made its advanced washing machine and camcorder into domestic
best-sellers through its extensive domestic distribution network, has
started to restructure its retail system.
The restructuring comes at a time when Japanese electronics companies are
facing sluggish demand due to slowing growth in both overseas and domestic
markets. In the year ended March, Matsushita expects a 43 per cent pre-tax
profits fall to Y340bn (Dollars 2.55bn).
The restructuring is part of a shift in Matsushita's strategy of
mass-marketing cheap products. Instead, the company intends to sharpen its
focus on 'value added' products, which it will market as enhancements to
consumers' quality of life. 'The age of focusing on quantity and market
share is over,' says Mr Jiro Aoki, head of Matsushita's domestic business
planning division.
Matsushita's retail network consists of some 27,000 small 'mom and pop'
stores called National shops after Matsushita's domestic brand name. This
extensive network of shops offering only Matsushita products has been the
underlying strength in the company's retailing power.
Matsushita has managed to maintain a tight grip on its retailers through a
special savings scheme. A National shop owner is allowed to place on deposit
1 per cent of every wholesale purchase with Matsushita, which in turn pays
the retailer 20 per cent interest on the deposit. At the end of March 1991,
Matsushita held a total of Y63.6bn in deposits from National shops.
However, the once cozy relationship has become an increasing burden on
Matsushita as the retailing power of the dealership has been undermined by
larger discount stores. Some of the retailers are finding it hard to attract
customers by offering only Matsushita products.
The group also faces overseas pressure as the exclusive retail networks
operated by Japanese electronics groups have become a target of criticism by
US trade negotiators.
Matsushita's restructuring plan includes altering its savings scheme over
the next three years and reforming the company's rebate system. The company
intends to change the old savings scheme by reducing the interest benefits
and setting more stringent requirements on retailers.
Only 50 to 60 per cent of the existing National shops are expected to have
sufficient turnover to survive after the restructuring and the smaller
stores, which are too small to purchase large quantities of stock from
Matsushita, are expected to drop out of the network.
Meanwhile, Matsushita has set up a new system to assist its National shops
through training programmes intended to enhance retailers' product knowledge
and marketing skills. For the small retailers who feel they cannot compete
alone, Matsushita will encourage mergers among the stores.
However, drastic changes are uncommon among Japanese companies, and reform
of the Matsushita distribution network is expected to proceed at a gradual
pace.
Mr Yutaka Sugiyama, an analyst at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew in Tokyo, says that
Matsushita first began restructuring its retail network in the mid-1980s,
but reforms were delayed after domestic demand surged and profits rose. 'If
things start looking better, they may forget about current problems again,'
he adds.

ROYAL Oak Mines, a small but growing Vancouver-based gold producer, is
reopening BP Canada's Hope Brook gold mine in south-western Newfoundland.
The mine was shut last year because of environmental and operating problems.
Production is to resume following the arrangement of a new CDollars 20m
(USDollars 16.6m) five-year aid package from the federal government. Royal
Oak last month bought the Hope Brook assets from BP Canada in a deal worth
CDollars 9m. The new owner also assumes the remaining CDollars 14m of an
earlier federal government loan.
Hope Brook has set a production target of 50,000 ounces in the last six
months of 1992 at an average cash cost of USDollars 300 an ounce. Royal Oak
is revising the underground mining operation and the milling process to keep
costs down.
Alcan Aluminium has won the right to resume a CDollars 1bn expansion of its
Kemano hydro-electric plant in north-western British Columbia.
The Federal Court of Appeal in Ottawa reversed a lower court ruling that the
project should undergo a full federal environmental review. The original
case was launched by native and environmental groups. The federal cabinet
early in 1990 exempted Kemano II from the full assessment and Alcan spent
nearly Dollars 500m on river diversion before halting construction.
Alcan needs the extra power to expand its Kitimat smelter.

<TEXT>
NORTHWEST Airlines, the fourth largest carrier in the US and one taken
private via a Dollars 3.65bn leveraged buy-out in 1989, made an after-tax
loss of Dollars 44.5m in the first quarter of 1992.
This compared with the net loss of Dollars 61.6m in the same period a year
earlier, when the Gulf war seriously disrupted traffic flows.
'While our first-quarter results reflected a moderate improvement from the
Gulf war-depressed levels of 1991, this improvement fell far short of
acceptable long-term performance targets,' said John Dasburg, chief
executive.
Northwest's results means the only big US carrier to show a profit in the
first three months of 1992 was American Airlines, which turned in a tiny
Dollars 20m surplus.
Mr Dasburg, like many of his competitors, blamed the 'continued sluggishness
in the US economy'. He also blamed recent weakness in the Japanese market.
Northwest has a large Pacific route network.
The airline's revenues in the first quarter rose 17.1 per cent to Dollars
1.92bn, while expenses climbed 14.6 per cent to Dollars 1.99bn. NWA, the
carrier's parent company, fared even worse. After bearing the brunt of lease
and interest costs, it reported a Dollars 103.1m after-tax loss in the first
quarter, compared with a loss of Dollars 158.1m in the first quarter of
1991.
Air Canada posted a first-quarter loss of CDollars 164m (USDollars 137.8m),
or CDollars 2.23 a share, much higher than analysts expected, writes Robert
Gibbens. The result compares with a loss of CDollars 100m, or CDollars 1.35,
a year earlier. Revenues dipped 5 per cent to CDollars 827m.
The latest period includes a CDollars 21m provision for staff reductions,
against CDollars 36m a year earlier. The loss was CDollars 63m higher also
because of a change in tax status. On an operating basis, results were down
3 per cent year-to-year.
Fewer travellers, ticket price wars, and lower cargo revenues more than
offset lower fuel costs and lower interest rates.
Rolls-Royce Canada will maintain the engines used in all USAir's 88
Rolls-Royce-powered aircraft at its Montreal overhaul plant, under a
CDollars 100m multi-year contract.

GAMBRO, Sweden's leading medical equipment manufacturer, announced yesterday
a 25 per cent rise in its profits after financial items, to SKr176m (Dollars
29.8m), for the first three months of the year. Sales were up 10 per cent to
SKr1.48bn.
Mr Berthold Lindqvist, the company's president, said the favourable
performance stemmed partly from the continuing integration of the US medical
equipment company Cobe, acquired in 1990. He also attributed the improvement
to product launches in recent years, rationalisation measures, and expansion
in markets where Gambro had been active.
He added that the company expected income for the year to exceed 1991's
figure of SKr594m.

<TEXT>
SAAB-SCANIA, the Swedish vehicle and aerospace group, has turned in a
substantial improvement in its profits after financial items for the first
quarter of the year. Yesterday it reported a SKr610m (Dollars 103.4m)
result, compared with SKr270m for the same period of 1991.
There was a 5 per cent decrease in consolidated sales, to SKr6.58bn from
SKr6.94bn. Return on capital rose slightly to 11.6 per cent from 11.2 per
cent.
The group said its forecast for 1992 was unchanged, with prospects of
'achieving an improved result', mainly due to last year's restructuring
measures.
With the likelihood of a 10 to 15 per cent drop in heavy truck sales this
year in western Europe, mainly because of a falling off in demand in the
German market, Saab-Scania announced a slight drop in its total truck and
bus sales, to SKr5.32bn from SKr5.35bn.
The company also reported a 16 per cent decline in aircraft sales, to
SKr992m in the first quarter compared with SKr1.18bn for the same period of
1991.
At the end of March, there was an order backlog for aircraft valued at
SKr11bn compared with SKr12.7bn for the same date in 1991.
Firm orders for the new Saab 2000 civilian aircraft, with the first
deliveries scheduled for autumn 1993, now amount to 46, with a further 148
in options. Last week's orders for 110 more JAS 39 Gripen fighter aircraft
for the Swedish air force has strengthened the company's sales position.
There was also an 18 per cent drop in sales in the group's Combitech
division, to SKr512m from SKr622m, though with an order backlog of SKr3.30bn
at the end of March.

COCA-COLA and Fraser and Neave (F&amp;N) have set up a joint venture soft drinks
company to operate in Singapore and Brunei, and later in Malaysia, Reuter
reports from Singapore.
The two partners said the joint venture, called F&amp;N Coca-Cola, would be

over F&amp;N's existing soft drinks operations in Singapore and Brunei.

CASCADES, the Canadian packaging products group with three plants in Europe,
plans to buy 50 per cent of Toronto-based Paperboard Industries, become its
managing partner and also take an option on the remaining 50 per cent.
Paperboard, with 17 plants in Canada and the US, has 3,000 employees and
annual sales of well over CDollars 500m (USDollars 416m). It is profitable
in spite of being hit by the recession. The company has been owned by a
group of banks led by the Royal Bank of Canada for the past two years,
following the failure of the previous owner.
Paperboard and Cascades would form a company ranking in the top five
international packaging groups.
Domtar, a big pulp and paper and building products group, lost CDollars 46m,
or 46 cents a share, in the first quarter, against a loss of CDollars 28m,
or 35 cents, a year earlier, on unchanged sales of CDollars 450m.
Domtar, Canada's largest fine paper producer, suffered very weak prices
though demand increased. It hopes to break even late this year and return to
profitability in 1993.

BROKEN Hill Proprietary (BHP) of Australia and Exxon of the US must pay
ADollars 68.7m (USDollars 51.6m) in additional royalties and interest on
their past oil production from Australia's Bass Strait fields, a panel of
arbitrators has ruled, AP-DJ reports from Melbourne.
The two companies have produced oil from the fields in a joint venture since
1969 and have paid ADollars 660m in royalties at a rate of 2.5 per cent of
the value of output.
Oil Basins Ltd receives and distributes the royalties.
Nearly 10 years ago, the royalty holders started legal action seeking that
the royalty be based on a calculation of value that included excise tax. BHP
and Exxon disputed this claim, which could have involved ADollars 2bn, and
the issue was submitted to arbitration.
The arbitrators ruled in the oil producers' favour in 1987 when they said
royalties should be determined after the deduction of excise tax.
However, the panel only now has decided that certain payments by BHP and
Exxon must be adjusted upward because the royalties are calculated on a
different basis from that used when production started.
As a result, BHP and Exxon must pay ADollars 32.4m in additional royalties
for the period 1969-1988, together with ADollars 36.3m in interest.

General Dynamics business

<TEXT>
HUGHES Aircraft is paying Dollars 450m in stock to buy the missiles business
of General Dynamics in an important re-alignment of the US missiles
manufacturing sector.
General Dynamics, the second largest US defence contractor, announced last
week it intended to sell its missiles operations as part of a programme to
divest non-core assets. Hughes, a subsidiary of automotive manufacturer,
General Motors, confirmed then it was negotiating to buy the business.
The deal will make Hughes one of the largest missiles manufacturers in the
US, roughly the same size as Raytheon, which also tried to buy General
Dynamics' business.
Hughes already employs 7,300 people making the AMRAAM advanced medium range
air-to-air missile, the Phoenix air-to-air missile, the Maverick
air-to-ground missile and the TOW anti-tank missile.
The General Dynamics businesses employs 9,000 on programmes which include
the Standard shipboard surface-to-air missile, the Stinger anti-aircraft
missile and the Tomahawk sea-launched cruise missile.
The deal, which is likely to lead to job losses as the two businesses are
consolidated, is one of the largest examples of the rationalisation in the
US defence industry as it grapples with sharply reduced Pentagon spending on
weapons systems.
Mr Michael Armstrong, chairman of Hughes, said the deal should have a
favourable impact on earnings and would enhance the company's ability to be
competitive in a wide range of missile systems.
The takeover, still subject to approval by the Defense Department and
anti-trust regulators, involves Hughes issuing General Dynamics with some
21.5m of its GM Class H common stock, which General Dynamics would quickly
sell off in a secondary offering. Hughes said the purchase was not expected
to dilute Class H earnings per share.
Mr William Anders, chairman of General Dynamics, said the deal would allow
his company to 'build further financial strength as we focus on
strengthening our four core defence businesses'.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ALTRON, the South African electronics and technology group, managed to lift
earnings by 19 per cent in the year to February in spite of a slight drop in
turnover.
Turnover dropped marginally to R2.65bn (Dollars 926m) from R2.66bn the
previous year, but operating income was 8 per cent up at R311.9m.
Attributable earnings rose to R92.7m from R77.6m. Earnings per share were 19
per cent up at 488.9 cents, and the dividend was raised by 12 per cent to
159 cents.
Mr Bill Venter, executive chairman, said the static turnover was the result
of the depressed business environment and the rationalisation of certain
non-performing assets and businesses.
He said the group was well placed to fund acquisitions and organic growth,
having accumulated a cash surplus of nearly R200m, up by R127m from 1991.
The turnround in the interest bill - to income of R17.5m from a charge of
R11m - and tight controls were the main reasons for the good operating
performance.
Altron has been hard hit in recent years by lower state expenditure on
telecommunications and defence, but the results, achieved against a
difficult background, suggest the worst is behind the group.
Mr Venter said many new opportunities were being pursued as the group sought
to broaden the base of its products and markets.
Altech, the electronics arm of the group, lifted attributable earnings by 11
per cent to R92m. Mr Venter said a number of new product developments were
nearing fruition and should contribute significantly to future performance.
Earnings rose by 5 per cent to R43m at Powertech, the power technology
subsidiary. Mr Venter said the company was well placed to take advantage of
increased infrastructural spending by the South African government.
Fintech, the information technology subsidiary, lifted attributable earnings
by 114 per cent to R20m. Mr Venter said rationalisation in the group was
largely complete and order books stood at record levels.

THE HEAD of Japan's most powerful business group has urged the government to
take steps to help restore confidence among individual investors in Nippon
Telegraph and Telephone, Kyodo reports from Tokyo.
Mr Gaishi Hiraiwa, chairman of the Federation of Economic Organisations
(Keidanren), said yesterday that NTT stock was a symbol of speculative fund
management known as zaitech. As a result, the sharp decline in NTT share
prices in recent months had soured enthusiasm among individual investors in
the stock market as a whole, he said.
Mr Hiraiwa, however, did not specify what measures the government might
adopt to revive the price of NTT shares, which have plunged from a high of
Y3.18m in late April 1987 to Y638,000 a share yesterday.
Calls have been heard in the market for cutting the face value of NTT shares
to make it easier for investors to purchase the stock.
Mr Hiraiwa said Tokyo stock prices have seemed to have hit bottom and that
volume was increasing. However, he added the key to a further recovery in
the market was the participation by more individual investors.

FRENCH stock exchange authorities yesterday suspended trading in the shares
of MMB, a holding company which controls Hachette, the media group, and
Matra, the defence electronics to transport company.
The Societe des Bourses Francaises (SBF) gave no reason for the suspension,
which lasts until Wednesday. However, an MMB spokesman said it was to calm
the market in MMB shares after the price had jumped more than the 10 per
cent daily maximum at which a suspension is triggered.
Speculation in MMB's shares has been intense since last week's announcement
that Hachette and Matra were to merge by the end of the year. The two
operating companies' share prices have also risen steeply since then.
As part of the project, MMB is to be transformed from a normal company into
a societe en commandite par actions, an unlimited share partnership. This is
a way of locking up control of the group and making it nearly invulnerable
to hostile bids.

sharp rise

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRE-TAX profits at Hapag-Lloyd, the German shipping, airline and travel
group, improved dramatically last year, rising to DM140m (Dollars 84.8m)
from DM41m in 1990. The dividend is to be increased to DM10 from DM8 per
share.
The group is also proposing a rights issue, raising its authorised share
capital by a nominal DM40m - an increase of a third on existing share
capital of DM120m. Hapag-Lloyd said that the aim of the issue was to secure
funds for further investment in growth areas of its business. Details will
be fixed at the date the new shares are issued following the shareholders'
meeting on June 22.
The company warned that operating profits would probably fall this year
because of declining returns in the shipping sector, the group's biggest
business.
Mr Hans Jakob Kruse, chairman, said the central reason for the turnround in
group profits last year was the recovery in the liner shipping division,
accounting for 57 per cent of group total sales of DM3.66bn last year. This
was due to 'substantial improvements in cost structures'.
The chairman said the shipping division's returns were still inadequate in
view of the heavy capital tied up in ships and containers, and forecast that
the business would remain vulnerable to declining trade growth rates and an
over-supply of shipping space and weak freight rates. The trend during the
current year would be markedly weaker, he said.
The tourism division, which accounted for almost a third of group turnover,
had a good year in profits terms with a particularly good performance from
the Hapag-Lloyd airline because of high seat-load factors.

LUFTHANSA, the German airline, made a loss in the first quarter, continuing
the poor financial trend which caused it to lose around DM400m (Dollars
250m) in 1991.
The company, which will give full details of its performance at its annual
press conference on Thursday, declined to give the size of the loss or to
comment on reports that this was also around DM400m.
Last year, the airline made a loss of DM475m in the first quarter, which was
affected by the impact of the Gulf war. It recovered in the next two
quarters but ended up with a loss for the full year, since the final quarter
suffered from the weak state of the world economy.
Mr Jurgen Weber, chief executive, has said several times that the airline,
which is 52 per cent state-owned, will have to take drastic action to
improve its efficiency and cut costs.

FT  12 MAY 92 / International Company News: Rights issue by Conti seen as
turning point in Pirelli saga
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE BATTLE of wills between Pirelli and Continental may reach a turning
point following Continental's decision yesterday to propose a DM150m
(Dollars 90m) rights issue.
Pirelli, the Italian tyres and cables group, still owns 5 per cent of
Continental's shares and has call options over 34 per cent more after last
year's unsuccessful takeover attempt.
Senior executives at Pirelli, which is headed by Mr Marco Tronchetti
Provera, said they were waiting to see the terms of Continental's proposed
capital increase before deciding their own strategy. The German company's
plan must be approved by shareholders on July 3 before going ahead.
A top executive said Pirelli did not consider the move, which has been
rumoured for some time, as hostile. Relations between the two companies
'were neither positive nor negative' at present. 'I don't think it's against
us,' he said.
Analysts have suggested that Continental's capital increase may be part of a
plan to buy some of Pirelli's businesses which are now for sale. Continental
is believed to be particularly interested in Pirelli's Munich-based Metzeler
auto components arm.
Using cash from a rights issue - part of it possibly coming from Pirelli
itself - for the purchase would be a neat turning of the tables for
Continental. In September 1990 it faced a takeover proposal by Pirelli which
appeared to require it to issue large amounts of debt to finance Pirelli's
own plans.
Whatever the outcome of the capital increase, both companies are now
concentrating on restructuring. Announcing audited net losses of L729bn
(Dollars 586m) last year, or L622bn after minority interests, Pirelli said
its tyre activities had broken even so far this year.
The improvement came largely thanks to heavy cost cutting, which involved
the loss of 6,000 jobs and closure of a number of factories. However, the
Pirelli executive said earnings had also been helped by 'some slight
improvement' in tyre prices. After three years of vicious price wars between
manufacturers, 'we've reached a bottom from which we can start to rise', he
noted. The company hopes that further cost-saving will return the tyres
business to profit in 1992.
Pirelli is also advancing with the disposal of its diversified products
division, which accounts for around 17 per cent of turnover. Negotiations on
selling four of the seven 'business units' into which the division has been
split are reaching a second, conclusive, phase.
The four business units, which together have turnover of L1,200bn, produce
anti-vibration systems, automobile profiles, hoses and assemblies, and power
transmissions. Numerous offers had been received for all the businesses by
the end-April closing date, and Pirelli executives are now sifting through
the bids.
The offers will be reduced to a maximum of four for each business unit.
Those selected will then be given access to detailed financial information,
and be permitted factory visits.
All the offers have included indicative prices. However, the Pirelli
executive said it would still be some time before the first deal was
announced, as the selection would be complex and further clarification was
necessary in some cases.

HANSON, the Anglo-American conglomerate, has told Fried. Krupp, the German
steel and engineering group, that it is not willing to pay the Pounds 250m
(Dollars 442.5m) price tag for its loss-making crane business.
According to one of Hanson's financial advisers, negotiations collapsed at a
preliminary stage.
Krupp yesterday confirmed that it was in 'co-operation' talks with foreign
companies about the future of the business.
While the talks continued the group was also undertaking a sweeping internal
restructuring programme, a spokesman said. Mr Gerhard Cromme, chairman, said
last week that the mobile crane business was the only part of Krupp's plant
building division which failed to break even, and the market was expected to
continue its downward trend.
Similar negotiations and rationalisation measures are also under way with
the O&amp;K cranes division of Hoesch, which is currently being taken over by
Krupp.
Hanson is still expected to make its next big acquisition in the US,
although the group remains interested in expanding in continental Europe and
is looking at several possible opportunities.
Mr Derek Bonham, Hanson's newly appointed chief executive, believes that it
is important for Hanson to branch out of its traditional Anglo-American
markets but only at the right price.
Krupp's crane-making business was seen as a possible bolt-on acquisition to
Hanson Grove Industries, which boasts the largest hydraulic crane
manufacturer in the world.
Grove, which was spun off from Kidde after it was acquired by Hanson in 1987
for Pounds 1.75bn, made Dollars 85m operating profits on sales of Dollars
480m for the year to end-September 1991.

FT  12 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Elswick edges ahead to Pounds 2.25m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ELSWICK, which is focusing on print and packaging after divesting from
bicycles, slightly improved pre-tax profit last year, but was unable to pay
a final dividend because of below-the-line losses.
The pre-tax figure went up to Pounds 2.25m (Pounds 2.22m) on sales of Pounds
59.9m (Pounds 58.2m) in the year to January 31. A small decline in operating
profit to Pounds 3.29m (Pounds 3.4m) was offset by reduced interest payments
of Pounds 1.03m (Pounds 1.17m).
In December the group sold Falcon Cycles, ending more than 100 years of
involvement in the bicycle industry. Operating losses as well as the deficit
on the disposal were included in extraordinary charges. The Pounds 3.66m
total also took in the cost of closing a US domestic lawnmower business.
After a Pounds 2.15m drain on reserves, the group was left with a deficit on
its profit and loss account, preventing a final dividend from being paid.
Mr Bill Cross, chairman, said this was a 'technical glitch'. The share
premium account would be used to eliminate the deficit and dividend payments
should resume with this year's interim.
The core print and packaging division, involving self-adhesive labels,
garment labels and foil, made an operating profit of Pounds 2.64m (Pounds
2.61m) on sales of Pounds 26m (Pounds 24.3m). Mr David Cross, chief
executive and son of the chairman, said about Pounds 16.5m had been spent
between 1987 and 1990 on acquisitions to establish the division. Capital
spending amounted to more than Pounds 13m in the past five years and a
further Pounds 2.8m was scheduled for this year.
The equipment and services division saw profit fall to Pounds 644,000
(Pounds 1.01m) on sales of Pounds 23.6m (Pounds 23.9m). The benefits of
cost-cutting and reorganisation should begin to flow through next year, he
said. The businesses were being run as 'cash cows' and would eventually be
sold.
Bank borrowings fell from Pounds 4.96m to Pounds 518,000 with the help of
the disposal and cuts in working capital. However, counting about Pounds
4.5m of loan notes, year-end gearing stood at 77 per cent on shareholders'
funds of Pounds 6.54m (Pounds 8.8m).
Diluted earnings per share fell to 0.98p (1.02p). Omission of the final
dividend leaves shareholders with just 0.22p (0.6p) for the year.
COMMENT
While there might be some investor annoyance at the failure to pay a final
dividend, welcome by-products are a Pounds 1m saving and a lower base from
which to rebuild cover. Last year should also have been a low point for
pre-tax profit, with benefits to come from the expansion of print and
packaging, margin improvement in equipment and services and lower interest
costs. A rising tax charge should be the only drag on earnings. The
turnround story has been rather drawn out since the present management came
to the rescue in 1985. With bicycles no longer putting a spoke in the wheel,
the ultimate proof of the strategy will be the delivery of significant
profit increases from print and packaging. A forecast pre-tax profit of
Pounds 2.8m gives a prospective p/e of nearly 11 on yesterday's close of 10
1/2 p, not expensive for the sector.

If the Commission decides after a month that it has 'serious doubts' about
the deal's effect on competition it will mount an in-depth investigation,
which could last up to four months.
If it is still unsatisfied, the Commission can then block the merger or

FT  12 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Parkland sees better margins as losses are
cut
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR DENIS Greenwood, chairman of Parkland Textile (Holdings), said that the
woollen yarn, worsted cloth and clothing manufacturer was coming out of
recession and that in the current year he expected to see a rise in turnover
and improved margins.
The group reduced pre-tax losses from Pounds 3.6m to Pounds 2.17m in the
year to February 28. Losses in the second half were cut to Pounds 796,000
from the Pounds 1.37m incurred in the first six months.
However, stripping out last year's Pounds 2.11m exceptional charges and
increased interest this time of Pounds 957,000 (Pounds 351,000), left
full-year trading losses fractionally up at Pounds 1.21m (Pounds 1.14m).
Turnover slipped to Pounds 49.4m (Pounds 50.7m).
Despite the completion of most of the capital expenditure programme, the
interest bill did rise after what Mr Greenwood said he hoped would be the
last significant payments.
He said that wool prices had slowly risen in the past four months after the
decline in 1991, thereby stabilising the market, but he added that, in the
period under review, margins had been 'poor', with the core Parkland Textile
weaving business the weakest performer in the group.
Knoll Spinning was now showing signs of improvement, Mr Greenwood said, and
Yorkshire Yarn Dyeing had a 'satisfactory' year in the context of the
depressed industry. In the garments division, the market remained
competitive, though more of the production has been moved abroad, easing
margins.
Current orders across all divisions were being taken on much stronger
margins, he said. Low demand in the UK and the return of sales in the Middle
East to more normal levels led to an increase in exports from 10.4 to 15.2
per cent.
Losses per share were more than halved to 19.9p (43p) and the final dividend
is held at 1p for a total of 2p (2.5p).

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Coats Viyella, the UK's largest textile company, has called a halt to talks
concerning its proposed sale of Lantor, the nonwoven materials business, to
the privately owned Freudenberg Group of Germany.  Coats said that Lantor,
acquired as part of Tootal last year was not now for sale.
Mr Sam Dow, Coats company secretary, said that the sale had been cancelled
to 'settle the minds of shareholders', adding that agreement on price had
not been reached.  In March, it was thought Lantor might fetch less than
Pounds 25m: when Tootal bought the 49.9 per cent it did not already own in
1988, the valuation of the whole company was nearer Pounds 40m.
Mr Dow also said the interest of the German Cartel Office could have added
about four months to the disposal discussions.

The loss, which compared with previous profits of Pounds 79,000, was largely

<TEXT>
GKN, the UK engineering and automotive components group, yesterday announced
it had sold its scaffolding business in Australia for ADollars 45m (Pounds
20.5m) after an unsolicited approach from a locally quoted group.
The UK group has also swapped some of its loss-making Australian plant
rentals branches for mobile lift equipment with Kennards Rentals of
Australia, in a deal involving no cash.
'We have taken two useful steps to improve the prospects in the Australian
construction market,' GKN said. The construction market was 'in dire
straits' and there were few signs of improvement. GKN Kwikform, the
Australian subsidiary, would still be losing money after the reorganisation.
Waco International, the buyer which is already in the scaffolding business,
will pay GKN ADollars 33m immediately and the balance over five years. GKN's
scaffolding division had sales of ADollars 35 in 1991 and suffered a small
trading loss.
GKN Kwikform will be left with three divisions; the slimmed-down plant
rentals business; light access equipment; and temporary accommodation units.

<TEXT>
WINDSOR, the specialist sports and leisure industries insurance broker, has
returned to the black following an internal reorganisation.
The group recorded pre-tax profits of Pounds 102,000 for the six months to
March 31, against losses of Pounds 373,000 last time.
Operating income fell to Pounds 3.21m (Pounds 3.82m), largely reflecting the
impact of the sale last November of Bishops-court Financial.
Earnings per share of 0.21p compared with losses of 1.13p.
Overall, the group generated about 20 per cent of its income from sports
insurances, of which about a tenth is earned in the US.
Mr Mike Eagles, chief executive, identified various types of prize indemnity
insurances - technically known as contingency policies - as attractive
growth areas.
These policies cover the cost of paying bonuses to successful players or
teams or prizes to winners of competitions designed to promote particular
sports events, such as grand prix or golf tournaments.
Windsor has recently broadened its base away from traditional property and
liability insurances for the UK's football league clubs to develop its
business in golf, motor racing, snooker, tennis and boxing.
It also specialises in leisure industries sectors such as advertising
agencies, commercial radio, restaurants and hotels, which contribute between
25 and 27 per cent of its income. It also places insurance in the London
market on behalf of retail brokers specialising in high risk areas such as
demolition contracting and asbestos removal.

FT  12 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Ensign takeover results in restructure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Personal Finance Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IVORY &amp; SIME and the Merchant Navy Officer's Pension Fund have entered into
a complex restructuring deal, following the takeover of Ensign Trust.
MNOPF has bought out the minority shareholding in Ensign, an investment
trust managed by Ivory &amp; Sime. The management contract for Ivory &amp; Sime had
three years to run.
The quoted element of Ensign's portfolio is being transferred to other
managers but the unquoted element of about Pounds 61m will continue to be
managed by Ivory &amp; Sime.
MNOPF is buying out the old management contract at a cost of Pounds 2m, and
Ivory &amp; Sime will henceforth manage the unquoted funds for Pounds 400,000
per year. In addition, Ivory &amp; Sime will manage a smaller companies fund on
behalf of MNOPF. The initial capital of this fund will be Pounds 12m, but it
is expected to rise to Pounds 40m.
Meanwhile, Ivory &amp; Sime will buy in 7.2 per cent of its shares, currently
owned by Ensign. This will be done at a cost of Pounds 2.4m - effectively
using up the proceeds of the contract pay-off - and will enhance earnings
per share. Ensign's stake in Ivory &amp; Sime will fall to 18.5 per cent.

Pre-tax profits were up by 3 per cent to Pounds 3.37m (Pounds 3.22m) as
Travers Morgan was further integrated, boosting sales and improving profit
margins.
Turnover, net of subcontracts, rose by 42 per cent to Pounds 36.8m. Sales

respectively.
Earnings per share were unchanged at 2.8p; per ADR they were 24 cents (24.4
cents).
Taking in these figures, profits for the six months to end-March amounted to
Pounds 6.95m (Pounds 7.3m), achieved on turnover of Pounds 65.8m (Pounds
52.8m).
Earnings emerged at 5.6p (6.1p), or 48.5 cents (52.8 cents). The interim
dividend is maintained at 0.875p.

ABERDEEN TRUST, the fund management company, yesterday reported pre-tax
profits up 77 per cent, from Pounds 584,000 to Pounds 1.04m, for the half
year to March 31.
The improvement, however, reflected the elimination of exceptional costs.
Operating profits dipped from Pounds 1.21m to Pounds 1.04m.
Earnings per share were 0.97p (0.75p); the interim dividend is unchanged at
1p.
Mr George Robb, chairman, said that Cheval Investment Management, which
manages fixed interest funds for clients of Lloyd's of London, increased
funds under management by Pounds 75m to Pounds 400m as Lloyd's acquired new
clients.
Funds under group management were Pounds 1.1bn at the period end, compared
with Pounds 775m on September 30 1991.
Unlike most Scottish fund management groups which prefer to centralise their
fund management function, Aberdeen yesterday opened an office in Singapore
to manage funds in south-east Asian companies and assist marketing to
clients in the region.

FT  12 MAY 92 / UK Company News: The Battle For Midland - MPs could hold the
whip hand / Parliament may have the power to block merger of banking assets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MEMBERS OF Parliament may have the power to block the merger of Lloyds Bank
and Midland's banking assets if Britain's third largest clearer wins the
battle for its rival.
Such a move, which could only occur after a Lloyds victory, would
potentially undermine the commercial logic of the tie-up by limiting Lloyds'
ability to improve the efficiency of a joint network.
Lloyds is competing with Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation to take
over its fellow clearer, which was once the world's largest bank.
The opportunity for MPs to intervene arises because of the need for an Act
of parliament to transfer assets and liabilities from one bank to another.
Lloyds referred to this last month when it said that 'the transfer of
Midland Bank's assets and liabilities to Lloyds Bank would require an Act of
parliament.' The bank would expect this to take place in 1993, 'thereafter
all Midland Bank branch banking activities would be conducted under Lloyds
Bank's name.'
The normal procedure for obtaining the Act would involve lodging a petition
with the House of Commons on or before November 27, giving the private bill
the chance to be processed in that parliamentary session.
It is quite common for private bills - which have historically been used
chiefly to clear the way for the construction or extension of railway lines
 -to pass through the House unopposed and hence undebated.
Hongkong Bank argues that current concerns about the possible impact of a
Lloyds-Midland merger on competition and employment levels in the banking
sector are so pronounced that some MPs may decide to attempt to block the
bill's passage. Even if they do not, it suggests, a referral of the Lloyds
offer to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission would make it difficult for
its rival to get its bill into the next parliamentary timetable. This could
delay the lodging of a petition until November 1993 and the measure's
enactment until July 1994 or later.
A little-used mechanism exists for the late lodging of petitions but express
permission from the parliamentary authorities is needed.
Parliamentary officers state that in recent years fewer private bills have
completed their passage through Westminster in a single session than
formerly for a variety of reasons. Of bills for which petitions were lodged
in November 1990, just four had received their assent by the end of the
parliamentary year in 1991 against 19 which had not.
Hongkong does not expect its own proposals to require the passage of a
private bill because it intends to run Midland as a discrete entity. Mr
Bernard Asher, a Hongkong Bank executive director, disclosed last week that
the bank would nonetheless make cuts in Midland's 1,900-strong branch
network and in its treasury operations.
Lloyds advisers think it unlikely that MPs would seek to impede the private
bill's progress because the takeover to which it related would by then have
received the authorities' blessing and because of the additional uncertainty
for Midland account-holders such a course of action would provoke.
They do not anticipate that the time a bill would take to pass would present
a problem because Lloyds would not wish to effect the transfer of assets
immediately following a takeover. 'The timetables tend to mesh,' said one
adviser.
Senior executives of both Midland suitors will have meetings with
Conservative backbenchers later this week.

FT  12 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Institutions fail to block Bosch's bid for
Worcester
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A GROUP of institutional investors in Worcester Group, the UK's largest
manufacturer of combination boilers, has failed to block an agreed bid for
the company by Robert Bosch, the German industrial conglomerate.
The institutional shareholders had claimed to the Takeover Panel that the
bid considered management's interests at their expense.
The institutions, holding 27 per cent of Worcester's shares, said they were
concerned the offer could set a damaging precedent for non-management
shareholders in future.
'As a matter of principle, it was important for us to pursue the matter,'
said Mr John Thompson, head of UK equities at Standard Life who was active
in formulating the challenge.
The shareholders argued that the offer violated the first principle of the
Takeover Code which requires all shareholders to be treated fairly.
The shareholders sought to challenge a decision by the Takeover Panel's
executive which approved the agreed bid for Worcester offering management
different terms to those offered to shareholders. Worcester is 38 per cent
owned by members of the management and their families.
Before making its offer public, Bosch also obtained irrevocable commitments
to tender shares from investors holding another 13 per cent of Worcester,
making it impossible for any other bidder to succeed with a counter offer.
Standard Life and five other institutional shareholders retained City
stockbrokers Cazenove to represent them before the panel.
Under terms of the agreement, institutional shareholders will receive 225p
in cash for each of their shares while members of the management will have a
stake in a new company and can earn up to 393 1/2 p per share when they are
finally bought out by Bosch in 1996. However, they may earn as little as
100p per share depending on the company's performance.
Yesterday, the panel, while conceding that management shareholders were
receiving different terms than other shareholders, said it accepted the
assertion of Worcester's financial advisers, Smith New Court, that the value
of the two offers were roughly equal.
'On the evidence provided to it, the panel saw no reason to question these
judgments and, in addition, the panel was satisfied that the appropriate
risk as well as reward was present in relation to the management
shareholders' retained equity interest,' the Takeover Panel said in a
statement yesterday.
Meanwhile, Mr Peter Lee, deputy director general of the Takeover Panel
executive, said the decision should not be seen as precedent setting. 'I
don't think any inferences should be drawn about future cases,' he said.

FT  12 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Resolution of Maxwell insurance claim nears
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS and RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PROTRACTED negotiations over unresolved insurance claims connected to the
mysterious death of Mr Robert Maxwell last November appear to be reaching a
final phase.
It emerged yesterday that Mr Roger Rich of loss-adjusters Rich Wheeler &amp;
Company, who is acting on behalf of the insurers, had travelled abroad to
complete his final investigations into Mr Maxwell's death.
It is thought that Mr Rich may be in Villefranche-sur-Mer, on the Cote
D'Azur, where the Lady Ghislaine, Mr Maxwell's boat from which he fell
overboard on November 5, is for sale.
A group of insurers, including Lloyd's syndicates and London market
companies, stand to pay Pounds 20m if it can be shown that Mr Maxwell died
from accidental causes.
Mr John Fisher, claims manager for Lloyd's syndicate 782, which led the
policy, said that the insurers had met last week with Hextall Erskine, the
solicitors, and that the matter was now in their hands.
Six months of negotiations involving the insurers, the Maxwell group of
companies, and Arthur Andersen, the Maxwell administrators, have failed to
lead to an agreement, with neither side providing conclusive proof as to the
cause of death,
In February, Lloyd's made an initial announcement saying that they were not
prepared to pay up the policy as, in their view, there was no liability.
An earlier report by Rich Wheeler concluded that the evidence suggesting Mr
Maxwell took his own life was 'more compelling than any other cause'.
Since Mr Maxwell's death the Lady Ghislaine has been moved from Gibraltar to
Mallorca and on to Antibes in a continuing attempt to find a buyer. It is
understood that Camper &amp; Nicholson, the agents, have reduced the initial
asking price of Dollars 24m (Pounds 13.5m) for the 55m yacht.

FT  12 MAY 92 / Citicorp man may chair O&amp;Y talks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR BILL RHODES, the Citicorp director who leads commercial banks'
negotiations with debtor nations in Latin America, has been asked by Olympia
&amp; York and its bankers to play a similar role in the O&amp;Y debt talks.
In last week's meeting between O&amp;Y, which has debts of Dollars 12bn (Pounds
6.7bn), and its 15 biggest bank creditors, Mr Rhodes acted as chairman. He
is considering whether to continue to fulfil this function until the
troubled property developers' future is resolved.
The group of 15 is expected to meet again within the next 10 days and is
expected to become the main forum for discussing the big issues confronted
by all 100 of O&amp;Y's banks.
Meanwhile representatives of the 11 bank lenders to Canary Wharf pointed out
yesterday that the future of O&amp;Y's East London office development remains in
the balance. 'There is a misunderstanding about why we agreed to provide O&amp;Y
with Pounds 21m for Canary Wharf last week', said one senior banker. He said
providing the money was not a vote of confidence in Canary Wharf's future.
'Bankers felt on the Canary Wharf sub-committee that time is needed to
properly evaluate the project's prospects', he added. The Pounds 21m is
enough to keep Canary Wharf out of administration, under UK insolvency
procedures, until the end of the month.
'Even if Canary Wharf went into administration, the banks would have to
continue funding it', the banker said.
The Canary Wharf banks say they are encouraged by the UK government's plan
to take around 500,000 sq ft of space at Canary Wharf. However a banker
said: 'We need to be sure that the government is taking the space at
commercial rates. If it is not, then the commercial viability of Canary
Wharf will remain in doubt.'
Banks have been told by O&amp;Y that the government is refusing to make any
concessions relating to O&amp;Y's commitment to provide Pounds 400m towards the
cost of extending the Jubilee underground railway line from central London
into Canary Wharf. Bankers had hoped the government would at the very least
defer some of O&amp;Y's payments to the end of the decade.
As a result, the rental to be paid by the Department of Trade and Industry
and the Environment Department for their space will be even more crucial to
whether Canary Wharf can avoid administration.
O&amp;Y is talking to four other prospective tenants for Canary Wharf. If the
government signs up for its space, O&amp;Y believes other possible tenants may
do the same.
That would allow O&amp;Y to raise funds for the Jubilee line contributions by
refinancing individual buildings against the security of future rents.

FT  12 MAY 92 / The Lex Column: Hanson
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
There was something comically predictable about yesterday's talk in the
London market of a bid from Hanson. The assumption was that because Hanson
has failed to get anywhere with ICI, it is bent on making the same mistake
with a fresh target. The idea of a bid for BP may have been regarded as
slightly far-fetched. But there was plenty of enthusiasm for Blue Circle,
English China Clays, Allied-Lyons and Cadbury Schweppes. One wonders why the
market was not equally excited by BTR's sale of its stake in Pilkington. Why
should Hanson not now bid for Pilkington and BTR for ICI?
This is not to dismiss the possibility of Hanson making a purchase which
would count as big by normal standards. Rumours of its interest in German
cranes or French cement would be consistent with the picture of a group
seeking to strengthen its portfolio through agreed deals. But Hanson is in
transition, with different and slightly confusing signals coming from the
new management and the old, from the UK and the US. Perhaps the best that
can be said is that its range of preferred industries seems to be shrinking
rather than expanding, and that in today's markets it seems unlikely to pay
the premium required for control in a bid battle.

FT  12 MAY 92 / The Lex Column: UK economy
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
After yesterday's consumer credit figures for March, the pre-election
picture of the UK economy is reassuringly complete. Even while sales were
taking a temporary turn for the better in February, credit advances were
slowing down. Retail sales were soft in the weeks before polling day because
consumers had neither the need nor the inclination to borrow. It was
scarcely surprising, then, that first-quarter figures for personal bank
loans showed a reversal of the small increase in borrowing during the run-up
to Christmas.
More generally, it is perhaps worth asking whether the drift away from the
use of credit by consumers means the series in question is an early
candidate for rationalisation by the new boss of the Central Statistical
Office. Arguably the broader credit series and monetary aggregates tell the
same story more fully.
But the more pressing problem is to divine what has been happening since the
election. Statisticians and economists alike are waiting to see whether
March's erratically soft numbers will be followed by an equally unreliable
rebound. Hence the greater attention being paid to forward indicators such
as consumer and business confidence. The Confederation of British Industry's
survey of small companies provided welcome evidence that optimism has begun
to permeate the lower reaches of the corporate sector. Equally, it suggested
a degree of scepticism among managers about the pace of recovery. While
orders are expected to increase, there will be only a modest rise in output.
If nothing else, it looks as if high unemployment will be around for a while
yet.

FT  12 MAY 92 / The Lex Column: WPP
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
By the standards of really big banking disasters, WPP is perhaps small beer.
But its financial reconstruction, formally announced yesterday, bears the
authentic scars of the 1980s. The deal is that the banks should write off
Dollars 250m of debt in exchange for 55 per cent of a company with a net
worth - even after the reconstruction - of rather less than zero. The stake
owned by ordinary shareholders will fall from two thirds to 14 per cent.
Holders of the convertible stock will see their equity entitlement fall from
34 per cent to 29 per cent. Since they presently control 80 per cent of the
votes as a result of WPP's failure to pay preference dividends, they may
well grumble about that. But as the banks will doubtless point out to them,
in a worthless entity like WPP the concept of democracy scarcely applies.
The most curious aspect of the deal is perhaps its timing. In the month
since the UK election, shares in Saatchi &amp; Saatchi - which went through the
same process of reconstruction just over a year ago - have risen by 66 per
cent. Other media stocks such as Reed and Pearson have also risen, if less
sharply. The recovery in advertising revenues on either side of the Atlantic
is patchy and uncertain. But it almost seems as if WPP's banks, while
writing off their mistakes in the lending game, have taken to playing the
equity market instead.

FT  12 MAY 92 / The Lex Column: The value of a name
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It looks as though the Lloyd's of London insurance market could now have
access to limited liability capital within two to three years, much earlier
than the Rowland Task Force report expected. Counsel's opinion indicates
that a new act of parliament will probably not be necessary to introduce
corporate Names, though negotiations with the Department of Trade and
Industry and overseas regulators over the solvency implications of this
could yet be protracted.
With Lloyd's results for 1989 set to make gruesome reading next month, it
could be that the much publicised flight of individuals will indeed
jeopardise the long-term growth of the market. It would, though, be unwise
for Lloyd's hastily to abandon a system that has served it well for nearly
300 years, and not just because of the unwelcome scrutiny that some of the
sleepier syndicates would suffer. The reason lies in one explanation of a
Hoare Govett survey last week suggesting that since the 1950s Lloyd's has
generally produced higher profit margins than leading UK and US insurance
companies. The argument is that Lloyd's big advantage is a more stable
capital base than the companies, which holds true even through the nightmare
years. While the market capitalisation of the five leading UK composites
between end-1989 and end-1991 fell from Pounds 11bn to Pounds 6bn, for
instance, the Lloyd's market capital contracted by only Pounds 1bn to Pounds
10bn.
Part of this is the three-year accounting period, which bars quick exits.
Part of it, though, may lie in the psychology of the private investor, who
is less given to rushing for the door when the going gets rough. The trick
in a business like insurance is to be in a position to take advantage when
the cycle turns. Lloyd's could obviously do with some spare corporate
capital at the moment, but it might reflect that in the long run,
institutions tend to be more fickle investors.

FT  12 MAY 92 / Letter: Bidder for Midland cannot sustain nationalist
position
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Prof DALE LITTLER and Dr PENNY CIANCANELLI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The current debate about the future of the Midland Bank should be
viewed from the perspective of the longer term dynamics of international
banking. It is clear that the combined impact of technological and legal
changes confront all banking organisations with stark choices.
The fundamental difference between the two bids for Midland is that one is
premised on an internationalist view of banking in the 1990s while the other
is based on an essentially nationalist view.
If Hong Kong and Shanghai gains control of Midland the UK will become home
to another of the world's large banking organisations. Midland's customers,
large and small, will have access to the facilities and competencies of a
worldwide organisation.
If Lloyds gains control of Midland, rationalisation will involve substantial
job losses. The UK will still have only one truly international bank,
reduced choice for small business borrowers (where margins are already good)
and increased competition for big business borrowers (where margins are
wafer thin or non existent).
Moreover, Lloyds and Midland share virtually nothing in information
technologies. So it is unlikely that rationalisation can proceed at a
timescale to produce the rate of cost savings forecast by Lloyds.
An inward looking strategy inevitably rests on the following premises that
retreat from international pressures is possible; that banks 'own' their
home markets; and that because continental banks have not yet entirely
solved the problem of entering British markets they will never do so.
There is no evidence to support these premises. All the research shows that
the long run forces are completely opposite: existing protected positions
within national markets are unsustainable as technology continues to
transcend artificial national boundaries and existing suppliers seek to
maintain growth and secure economies of scope and scale realisable through
international expansion.
Being a 'domestic' player may well have short-term attractions: downsizing
with its emphasis on cost reduction together with a careful focusing on
selected sectors and segments does offer shareholders short-term benefit.
But the resulting bank organisation will be ill-suited to face the
challenges of competitors which entered the international market place and
won market share worldwide.

FT  12 MAY 92 / Priorities and purpose at the heart of capitalism: The
Archbishop of Canterbury has criticised companies' narrow focus on
shareholders. Charles Handy calls for a shift in thinking
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES HANDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
What is a company for? The question sits uneasily at the heart of
capitalism. Until recently, with communism and centrally planned economies
as our common opponents, we were not pressed to provide an answer. To many
reared in the traditions of Anglo-American business, the answer anyway was
clear - 'to enhance shareholder value', with all that implied for
efficiency, customer service, shrewd investment and personnel policies.
The capitalist world, however, has lost its common enemy and must now look
more closely at itself. The countries newly emerging from socialism are not
entirely happy with all they see of capitalism. To them it is not
self-evident that what is good for some shareholders is necessarily good for
the rest of society. They also see there are different versions of
capitalism: Japanese, American, German, British.
As the world of business becomes more and more global, these different
traditions of capitalism bump up against each other. We not only have to
learn about them, we need to learn from them because they begin to close
towards each other as companies compete and combine. Working on different
assumptions will be untenable in the long term.
Akio Morita, the chairman of Sony, has taken the point. In an article in the
January edition of Bungei Shinju, the political and economic journal, he
suggests that Japan's competitiveness has been achieved by keeping margins
and prices low over a long time in a constant search for volume to provide
the cash-flow. This has, however, meant skimping the other stakeholders in
favour of the customer.
The average pay-out ratio, for instance, was 30 per cent in Japan in 1990
compared with 66 per cent for the average British company and 54 per cent
for US ones. Japanese employees worked 2,159 hours on average in 1989
compared with 1,638 in France and only 1,546 in Germany. Mr Morita argues
that neither the world nor Japanese society will tolerate these differences
much longer. Japan, he says, must fashion a new corporate attitude,
rebalancing stakeholder interests and going some way to meet the west.
We, on our part, may have to do the same but in the other direction. If we
don't, we may lose competitively. More of the earned surplus needs to go
back to the customer by way of lower margins and lower return on projects.
An open and tempting share market will also lure new owners for Anglo-Saxon
assets from overseas without any corresponding opportunities in their more
closed markets. A change to foreign ownership can often be beneficial in the
short term, but if too much of Britain ends up as an offshore manufacturing
subsidiary subject to the whims of outside owners, the risks are obvious.
We may, therefore, start to look at our shareholders rather differently, and
more as other countries do, as financiers rather than as owners. Satisfying
these financiers then becomes a requirement not a purpose. To turn
shareholder needs into a purpose runs the risk of confusing means with ends.
But this is a risk we seek to avoid by saying that shareholders' needs are
actually a yardstick for all other purposes.
The danger in doing this is that we undersell the real purpose of the
business, which is to provide quality goods and services to customers and
quality lives and work to its people. One cannot continue to do that without
keeping one's financiers happy at the same time. If they are not happy they
will blow the whistle, warn and then, if necessary, move the management
before the marketplace removes the business. Whistle-blowing is their
function, not the indirect management of the business.
Ownership is a misleading concept in other ways too. It suggests that a
company is a commodity to be traded and that its people are commodities too.
Too often that is exactly what happens, because in the Anglo-American
stockmarkets financiers have that power.
Should they have that power? They do not, after all, have the balancing
responsibilities of ownership. Because of the different ownership patterns
of Japanese and Continental companies the casual investor does not have the
same power as his counterparts in New York or London. The financiers in
Japan and on the Continent, therefore, are more like guardians, keeping a
watchful eye, but not jumping ship just because there is a torn sail.
Akio Morita called for a change in Japan's corporate attitude and suggested
that the big companies should lead the way. There are encouraging signs that
that is happening in Britain. More and more companies are formally listing
their priorities, often putting customers and employees ahead of
shareholders in the pecking order of stakeholders and taking pains to
educate the stockmarket about their long-term strengths and plans.
Now, too, that the investing institutions own two-thirds of the equity of
British businesses, they are effectively locked in and must become guardians
(though not owners) rather than traders. Some company chairmen are
cautiously lowering their real term dividends without upsetting their share
price in a more sophisticated market. Share option schemes are beginning to
be designed to reward long-term performance by managers rather than acting
as short-term cash bonuses.
We need to go farther faster. We need ways to put numbers on people's
skills, which are an increasingly important element in companies'
wealth-creating capacity, and on other forms of intellectual property.
Intangible assets already outweigh the tangible assets on the balance sheets
of many advertising agencies, consultants, publishers and architects. They
probably do so in most businesses, although this fact usually only shows up
during contested takeovers. Accountants, in other words, need to turn their
gaze on the future and measure it. If they will not do so, management
should.
We can no longer shelter behind shareholder value as a synonym for corporate
purpose. In business, as in life, we all need 'a purpose beyond ourselves'
to feel useful, worthwhile and good about ourselves.
Companies today are not like they were in Victorian times - properties with
tangible assets worked by hands whose time owners bought. Business today
depends largely on intellectual property, which resides inalienably in the
hearts and heads of individuals. Companies have to be re-conceptualised.
They are communities with members, communities which need customers,
suppliers, financiers and community support if they are to survive and
prosper in the interests of all.
We do not need to change company law to create this new idea of the company,
but we do need to change the way we talk and the way we count. That way we
will start to change the way we think, and then the way we act.

</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I am surprised the DTI's initiative in reconsidering the need for very
small companies to have an audit is not universally welcomed by the
accountancy profession ('Move to cut audits attacked').
There seems to be a fear that by abolishing the small company audit
directors of small companies will somehow be relieved of some of the
responsibilities of limited liability in terms of financial reporting.
In fact the opposite is true. The Companies Acts place responsibility fairly
and squarely on the directors of all companies of whatever size to prepare
annual accounts which comply with company law and accounting standards, and
require these accounts to be filed with the registrar within the
predetermined time limits.
The absence of an audit would force directors of small companies to take
these responsibilities more seriously as any legal action resulting from
material mis-statements in their accounts would be directed at them rather
than, as is often the case at present, at the auditors' professional
indemnity insurance.

<TEXT>
Sir, Perhaps I can set the mind of the outgoing president of the Chartered
Association of Certified Accountants at rest - at least to some extent
('Move to cut audits attacked', May 8).
We have consistently campaigned for measures that would ease the regulatory
burden on small companies. One such measure would be to allow small
proprietary companies to elect to dispense with a statutory audit, subject
to suitable safeguards. Another, as recently floated by the Department of
Trade and Industry, would be to create some abatement for those very small
companies below the Pounds 36,600 turnover threshold for vat. At this
turnover level, the current required fee for the full audit must be a
significant proportion of a company's profit.
We have therefore set up a working party to consider the latest suggestion
from the DTI and the related issues arising from it. In doing so we are
simply playing a part in moving towards an urgently needed new era of
deregulation. Michael Groom, chairman,

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your leaders, 'Los Angeles, a political test . . .and a warning (May
5), rightly draws attention to the possibility of similar events taking
place in the UK. You cite public disorder in North Tyne in September as a
threat which it would be foolish to disregard, yet difficult to escape, in
view of our failure to educate the present generation of young people in
deprived areas.
However, I think you are unduly pessimistic in suggesting that perhaps all
we can do is to lay better educational foundations for the next generation,
and meanwhile hope for the best. The adult education skills in the UK are
outstanding, and seriously under-used. Universities, local authorities,
colleges, the Workers' Education Association and other bodies have
organisational capacity which comparatively modest sums could bring into
use. The bulk of the teaching in this field is undertaken, very
inexpensively, by part-timers, while training and administration are carried
out by a small corps of professionals. A crash programme could be in place
within months. All that is required is cash, a strong political will, and a
little ingenuity in devising student incentives. By the time the educational
targets have been achieved, the government's expanded training programmes,
one hopes, will be in place. Adult and continuing education should seize
this opportunity with both hands.

FT  12 MAY 92 / Major's magic moments
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOE ROGALY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Everything seems to be going right for Mr John Major. The prime minister
should not be begrudged his magic moments. He has earned them. Indeed, they
may last longer than the fates usually allow, for since his return to
Downing Street on April 10 he has performed with the confident touch of a
man whose hold on his job has at last been legitimised.
Just over four weeks ago he led the Conservatives to their fourth general
election victory in a row. The fact that this was unexpected made the
achievement seem all the more remarkable. Yet there was none of the
triumphalism of June 1987 in last week's Queen's Speech, or in the prime
minister's presentation of it in the commons. With Mrs Margaret Thatcher in
charge, a majority of 100-plus, and the opposition in disarray, the Tories
of 1987-88 strutted about as if they were politically immortal; with Mr
Major in charge, a majority down to 21, and the opposition in apparently
worse shape than ever, the Conservatives of May 1992 are conducting
themselves with moderation and courtesy.
It would be uncharitable, and incorrect, to ascribe the government's
restrained demeanour entirely to the narrowness of its majority, or even to
the nasty premonitions of defeat that afflicted most of them during the
campaign. The matter-of-fact personality and emollient style of the prime
minister have also had something to do with it. If the Tories go on like
this they will end up more popular than they were during the Thatcher years.
The apparent rush of support for Conservatives in last week's local
elections is partly the consequence of Labour's demoralisation, but its
significance should not be discounted. After 13 years of continuous rule
what seems like an entirely new government has emerged. The prime minister's
political stature has been enhanced, not only in its own right, but also
when set against the diminishing public images of the German chancellor and
the presidents of France and the US.
The Conservatives are benefiting most of all from a perception that the
British economy is in better shape than those of its continental
competitors. People are beginning to get carried away on a wave of
exaggerated optimism. Some indicators suggest that the recession has
bottomed out, others that we have to wait. This is beside the point.
Recovery may be slow but there can be no doubt that it is on the way. We are
all bulls now - all, that is, except the unemployed, sellers of houses, and
retailers waiting for consumers to get the message.
The mood in the City has been transformed. The stock market has advanced to
record highs. Sterling is strong, and rising, in spite of a cut in bank base
rates by half a point to the lowest level for four years. Now the talk is of
British interest rates falling below Germany's, a notion that could not be
seriously entertained before polling day. There are many technical
explanations for this turnaround, but the simplest is the most compelling:
the markets are showing confidence in Mr Major's government.
Democrats may not savour the prospect of decades of one-party rule; markets
are more sanguine. The opposition is in abeyance. It is easy to sustain the
fancy that it may not return to power this century. Mr Major acknowledges
that mistakes were made during the recent campaign, but he has vowed that
they will not be repeated. His appointment of Sir Norman Fowler to rebuild
the Conservative party is one means to that end. Mr Fowler is a smooth
operator. Given four years in which to do the job his administrative
overhaul could make the difference in a score or more of marginals. The work
of the constit-uency boundary commission, generally thought to be worth
between 15 and 20 extra seats to the Tories, will have been completed before
there is a chance to vote again.
In these circumstances the size of the task facing both Labour and the
Liberal Democrats is greater than perhaps either party has yet realised. Mr
Paddy Ashdown's weekend call for a working relationship between the Lib-Dems
and Labour, 'to assemble the ideas around which a non-socialist alternative
to the Conservatives can be constructed' reaches to the nub of the matter.
Yet even when, as they surely must, both sides prove willing to talk that
will be only the beginning. The ideas they assemble must have relevance to
the needs of the future, not the past. Old Labour-Liberal rivalries must be
set aside. To be certain of an election victory the two parties must unite,
or one must swallow the other. Neither is yet ready to allow either
cataclysm to take place.
This leaves Mr Major facing the only hostile opposition he needs to fear:
the devastating force of unforeseen events. We cannot know when this monster
will show itself, or what form it will take. We can, however, be sure that
it will come. Events always overthrow governments in the end. For Mr Major
that experience may lie many years in the future.

Society
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Last winter the Contemporary Art Society celebrated its 80th anniversary by
filling the Hayward Gallery with a survey of its activities and achievements
over the years. The show concentrated, naturally enough, on the many plums
the Society had produced for the public cake. To those unfamiliar with the
Society's work, the scope of its engagement would have been surprise enough,
but the true revelation was the sheer quality of what it had bought.
Founded long before public funds were ever granted to public museums and
galleries to buy directly for their collections, the intervention of such
bodies as the CAS and the National Art Collections Fund was of critical and
determining importance. Regular visitors to any of the modern collections
held in our public galleries, not just in London but throughout Britain,
Australia and Canada, are never surprised to read below established
favourite and stimulating new acquisition alike: 'presented by the
Contemporary Art Society'.
That retrospective exercise of last winter is now complemented by this
practical demonstration of the Society's current business, its true raison
d'etre. Leaving aside its latter-day diversifications - the corporate
buying, the tours and visits, the autumn market - its animating principle
has always been to entrust the funds it has raised by private subscription
to the hands of its chosen buyers, drawn in turn from the ranks of its
executive committee. To them it gives an absolute discretion to buy what
they like or consider appropriate, within the budget. Some choose to set
themselves a policy, to plug a particular gap or to buy only work of a
certain kind or within a set price. Some might look only to young artists,
or artists hitherto unpatronised or long neglected. Some again might simply
buy ad hoc, responding directly to what the chances of the art world put
their way.
In recent years the Society has made it its policy to include Fine Craft
within its scope. One buyer a year is given this particular responsibility,
and at Camden the room of craft purchases is both reproach and encouragement
to those institutions yet to take the point. Given the comparative prices,
the only wonder is that the demand has not long ago outstripped supply.
When its store-rooms are full, the Society arranges a distribution to its
subscribing galleries and museums. Anxious curators swarm in to make their
lists and put in their bids. The great virtue of the system lies in its
arbitrariness and unpredictability, at once its responsiveness and immunity
to current fad and critical orthodoxy. The range of work is extraordinary in
its catholicity, fair and generous and always unexpected, and it puts
curators on the spot in a most salutary way. For here, on the one hand, are
works by the rising stars, such luminaries of the Turner Prize and pets of
the Patrons of New Art as Fiona Rae and Ian Davenport, that otherwise would
be quite beyond the reach of a straitened but serious provincial collection.
And on the other are works far below the priorities and current
preoccupations of so august an institution as the Tate, shall we say, yet
still something it would quietly wish to have - a Dennis Creffield Madonna,
an Anthony Eyton figure, a Harry Holland shadow or a John Hubbard garden.
What is pointed up above all else by this, as by every CAS distribution,
argued tacitly yet so vehemently in the demonstration, is that serious,
significant contemporary art is no narrow orthodoxy, the creature only of
the most refined and critically acute hierophants of the avant-garde. That
is not to argue that what comes out of Goldsmiths' at the moment, for
example, or goes into the Lisson Gallery, is necessarily innocent of talent,
but only that the sun rises on other places besides New Cross and Bell
Street.
For, fair or not, one does still sense in the official policies not only of
the Tate but also of the British and the Arts Councils, that by now it is
only the age and reputation of a Freud or an Auerbach, or for that matter a
Albert Irvin or a John Bellany, that secures any interest in them, rather
than what they still produce: they are, or were, good artists, but the world
has moved on.
That heresy must be nailed, and the simple truth proclaimed, that a painting
of a cornfield may have at least as much to say of current reality and the
human condition as any shark in a tank of formaldehyde. It is the Society's
great strength that it has never forgotten this truth, nor that fashion is a
fickle beast. Alongside the flavour of the moment, the Davenport, the Lisa
Milroy, the Le Brun, Jackowski or Kapoor, it still finds room for the
neglected or the temporarily unfashionable. These last are represented here
by such distinguished examples as the oddly hedonistic minimalism of Peter
Joseph, the symbolic expressionism of Martin Naylor, still-lifes by Len
McComb or Stephen McKenna, a constructivist relief by Keith Milow. The list
is endless, the show unfortunately little longer than a concert. See it.

It would be a rare year that produced another drama serial as good as Anglo
Saxon Attitudes, and since the relationships within this splendid Angus
Wilson story are pretty tangled it is advisable to watch carefully from the
beginning (8.30 ITV). Such dedication will be rewarded. This excellent
adaptation by Andrew Davies works on all levels: among the backbiting
historians, the homosexual demi-monde of 1950s London, and above all in
telling the odd, and yet in so many ways recognisable, story of the
Middleton family. Richard Johnson gives the best performance I have seen
from him as the upstanding yet imperfect patriarch around whom so much
revolves.
In Assignment the estimable Michael Charlton returns to his native Australia
to investigate the national identity crisis (if that is what it is)
exemplified by Prime Minister Paul Keating's notorious comments about
Australia and Britain (7.45 BBC2). BBC1's drama Boys From The Bush, which
returns for a second series, is also set in Australia where some pretty
far-fetched and/or farcical stories are built around a tin-pot detective
agency (9.30 BBC1).

Severn Trent has announced the appointment of Alan Costin as group finance
director in succession to Stuart Larnder, who resigned without explanation
last October.
Costin, who joins the privatised water supply, sewage and waste management
group next Monday, has been finance director of Lex Service, the car
retailing and leasing group, since 1987.
He joined Lex in 1970 and held a number of financial control positions in
the UK and US, including finance director of Volvo Concessionaires.
The abrupt departure of Larnder, who quit 'to pursue other interests',
caused surprise within the water industry since it came less than six weeks
before the group was due to present its half-year results, and John Bellak,
Severn Trent chairman, declined to enlarge on the terse resignation
statement.
Costin, who is 49, at present lives in Buckinghamshire.

THE DESIGN MUSEUM is being very stoical these days, a suitable attitude in
the light of its recent funding troubles. It thus seems entirely appropriate
that it has appointed a philosopher, Paul Thompson, 32, as its new director.
Thompson has jumped a rung, from the post of curator, and is joined at the
helm by John Hendry, 35, who will continue as administrative director.
The museum has thereby tacitly recognised the need to have two people taking
on the difficult roles of both financial administration and management and
programming of the Museum's galleries - functions previously performed by
its previous director, Helen Rees.
Thompson studied first at Bristol University, then moved to the University
of East Anglia to complete an MA, then a PhD on the origins of the modern
movement, focusing on the American philosopher William James.
The museum now has an operating budget of Pounds 1m for 1992, which given a
determination to match expenditure to income, should be enough to see it
through to better - and richer - days.

FT  12 MAY 92 / Technology: Moving the goal posts - How advances in sporting
equipment have changed the nature of the game
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES ARTHUR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Modern sports professionals rely more than ever before on sheer,
unadulterated power as a winning strategy. The American golf player John
Daly can hit a ball 340 yards off the tee; the German tennis star Michael
Stich can hit a serve at 120 mph, past all but the best opponents.
For these two, and hundreds of other professionals in their chosen sports,
the key to success is a mixture of athleticism and new equipment
technologies - specifically, graphite-fibre golf shafts and large-headed
tennis rackets made of composites of graphite and fibreglass. These have
unlocked power that was unattainable just a decade ago.
But simultaneously they represent changes in the games. Daly and Stich came
from nowhere last year to win one of their game's biggest events - Daly at
the US PGA championship at Crooked Stick, Indiana last August, and Stich at
Wimbledon last July.
But how much was skill, and how much the equipment? If the equipment alters
the nature of the game, should rule-makers ban it? Or should they welcome
the boost such advances offer amateurs, on whom the wider health of the game
depends?
The administrators do not know the answers. So the rules of modern sports
have become more like a weapon in a continual conflict with equipment
manufacturers, rather than a regulator of contests between players. After
all, is any tennis player likely to measure the width and length of an
opponent's racket-head? Or a golfer expected to grab an opponent's irons and
minutely examine the shape and spacing of the clubface grooves? Hardly. But
the rules specify them, sometimes to the millimetre.
Nor are tennis and golf alone in facing dilemmas caused by runaway
technologies. Hardly any sport is untouched, from athletics, where new
materials in some running tracks favour sprinters but penalise long-distance
runners, to yachting, where competitors in the bi-annual Americas Cup
competition now spend as much time puzzling over its rules, and wondering
whether new boat designs (produced in wind tunnels and supercomputer
modelling) break or bend them, as they do tacking and gybing.
'Equipment has had an effect on the game, but that's inevitable,' says
Andrew Coe, assistant product development manager at the tennis division of
BTR subsidiary Dunlop-Slazenger. 'It's just evolution.' Bob Haines, the
company's research and development manager, adds: 'Manufacturers, like
players, are competing with each other. And competition generally leads to
better equipment, too.'
That competition has created something close to an acute problem for men's
professional tennis. Until the late 1970s, every professional used wooden
rackets. Nowadays they all use graphite-fibre models which are lighter,
larger and stronger. These are made by heating acrylic fibres to around 270
deg C, when they form graphite and carbon fibres - far stiffer and lighter
than wood. These are then injection-moulded along with fibreglass in varying
ratios to produce composite rackets.
Being stiffer than wood, these transfer more of their energy into the ball,
which can be hit up to 30 per cent harder. Serves of over 100 mph are
common. Though the rackets are two-thirds bigger than wooden ones, the extra
size does not compensate for reduced reaction time. Thus the typical point
in a men's match next month at Wimbledon will last less than three seconds,
and consist of three strokes: serve, return and volley.
For spectators, such matches lack attraction. Thus the Association of Tennis
Professionals (ATP), which runs the majority of the men's professional
tournaments, and the International Tennis Federation (ITF), which lays down
the rules for use worldwide, are worried. If the professional game becomes
so boring that no one watches it, the ATP's members will have no income,
instead of the Pounds 35m in prize money offered on the tournament circuit
this year.
In March the ATP got together with the ITF and a number of player and
manufacturer representatives to discuss what it calls the 'power problem'.
Among the suggestions were changes to the size of the court, the rules, and
enforced reductions on racket sizes.
Manufacturers oppose limits for two reasons. First, as Haines says:
'Everything tends to get faster in sports; if you put an artificial control
on anything, that makes the sport artificial.' In other words, the sport
does not explore the players' limits of ability.
Second, amateurs adore more powerful rackets; they, not professionals, led
the move away from wood, which racket-makers followed happily because the
new rackets yielded higher profits.
Yet manufacturers have lost out through that. Wooden rackets wore out and
broke (within a few weeks when used professionally), but graphite often
lasts for years. Total sales worldwide have dipped from a peak of Pounds 15m
in 1981 to Pounds 11m in 1991. Racket-makers now have to rely on intensive
marketing, finding ever more exotic substances to incorporate in their
products: last year one offered materials also found in the Stealth bomber.
The problem for the ATP is that any changes it proposes should not affect
the women's professional game - which is separately run and publicly
delighted with the increased power the new rackets lend - and be relatively
cheap to implement. Limits on the rackets are most unlikely. 'It would be a
curtailment of freedom,' says Haines. It would also be likely to attract
Restraint of Trade lawsuits from US manufacturers - if pros could not use
them it would be hard to advertise them to the public.
An easier option would be to change the characteristics of the balls
themselves: making them bigger or more 'fluffy' would increase their air
resistance, slowing them down. This could also provide a marketing boost for
ball-makers.
Golf's rule-makers - the combined brains of the Royal &amp; Ancient Golf Club in
St Andrews, Scotland and the US Golf Association (USGA) in Far Hills, New
Jersey - have more room for manoeuvre than those in tennis. But they are
fighting on a variety of fronts: not just clubshafts, but also clubfaces and
balls. And their undoubted power to set the rules has not kept them clear of
the US legal system.
In the mid-1980s an American start-up company developed a ball called the
Polara. The pattern of the ball's dimples (which help it fly further)
effectively made a seam. Positioned correctly on the tee, it could be made
to swerve, like a cricket ball, as required. The USGA promptly banned it by
changing its rules; the Polara's makers sued. The USGA settled out of court
for a seven-figure sum.
A potentially bigger case, due to come to court later this year, involves
Karsten Manufacturing of Phoenix, Arizona, makers of the Ping range of
clubs.
The grooves on its Ping Eye2 range of iron clubfaces had a U-shaped profile
(instead of the usual V) and were also closer together than the norm.
Professionals using these could put more backspin on the ball and stop it
abruptly on landing.
The US Professional Golfers Association (PGA) decided this made them 'too
accurate'. In 1989 it banned the clubs from use in PGA tournaments and
proposed a rule banning U-shaped grooves - thus earning an injunction and a
lawsuit from Karsten Manufacturing. The case finally comes to court sometime
in the next six months.
Still the changes keep coming. Other manufacturers, including Yonex of
Taiwan and Spalding of the US, have produced 'wide-body' woods with heads 15
per cent larger and shafts 1.5 inches longer than normal. Novice golfers
like them, feeling they are more forgiving of imperfect shots. For once, the
rule-makers have not made any move.
The Royal &amp; Ancient and the USGA know that in rule-making they tread a fine
line between preserving the game and strangling the innovation that
manufacturers rely on to keep marketing their wares. They also know that
most of it is illusory. 'The improvements from technology are exaggerated,'
believes Alastair Cochran, technical adviser to the Royal &amp; Ancient. 'In the
US, the average handicap is the same as 15 years ago. I think peoples' views
are coloured by what a couple of professionals do with their special shots.
The biggest improvement in the past 20 years among the pros is the players,
not the equipment.'

FT  12 MAY 92 / The Week In Luxembourg (European Court): British estate
agents - a place in the Spanish sun
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRICK COURT CHAMBERS, Brussels FT Commercial Law Reports
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
European Community countries must recognise the professional qualifications
of estate agents from other member states if they are 'equivalent' to those
of their own profession, the European Court of Justice (ECJ) in Luxembourg
ruled last week.
In an important judgment providing useful guidelines for members of other
regulated professions and businesses wanting to set up in other member
states, the ECJ said in the absence of any EC directive on the mutual
recognition of qualifications, EEC treaty rules on establishment required
Community countries to determine whether qualifications obtained by an
estate agent in one member state were equivalent to those required in the
host country.
Failure to take account of estate agents' qualifications, when they applied
to establish in another EC state, would infringe their treaty rights, the
Court said.
If qualifications are equivalent, estate agents must be recognised as such
in the host country. If not, they may only be requested to prove that they
have those qualifications required by the host country which are additional
to those already obtained in their own country.
The case concerned the prosecution by the official Spanish Estate Agents
Association of an estate agency run by a British estate agent in Spain.
Mr Stephen Newman, a qualified British estate agent and member of the Royal
Institution of Chartered Surveyors, had applied in 1989 for admission to the
association but had not received an official response. He was charged,
together with Spanish colleagues, with breaches of the Spanish rules
governing estate agents.
Colegio Oficial de Agentes de la Propieda Inmobiliria v Aguire Borrell and
Newman, Case C-104/91, ECJ 6CH, 7 May 1992.
Turnover charges and value added tax
A claim by an Italian lawyer for repayment of a supplementary charge paid by
him on the basis of his annual fee income to the Italian lawyers' national
pension body on the grounds that it amounted to a tax on turnover precluded
by the EC's Sixth value added tax directive, was rejected by the ECJ.
The Court ruled that the sixth vat directive permits taxes, duties and
charges other than vat if they do not have the characteristics of a turnover
tax.
The Italian supplementary charge lacked three essential features of a
turnover tax: it was not a general tax; it was not always calculated purely
as a proportion of professional fees; and it was charged only at one stage
of the provision of services, when the client was invoiced, rather than on
value added.
The case has wider significance for other business sectors subject to taxes
which might be challenged as incompatible with the sixth vat directive.
Bozzi v Cassa Nazionale di Previdenza ed Assistenza a favore degli avvocata
e dei 'procuratori legali', Case C-347/90, ECJ, 6CH, 7 May 1992.
The Court also offered further clarification on the operation of the EC
sixth vat directive's rule requiring any private benefit from a business to
be subject to vat.
In the case of a Dutch builder who purchased land for his own private use
and then built himself a house on the land as part of his business activity,
the court said only the value of the house and not the land was subject to
vat.
This interpretation was consistent with the purpose of the rule being to
remove any inequality of treatment. An ordinary consumer who paid a third
party to build a house on his land would pay vat only on the price paid for
the house and not the land.
De Jong v Staatssecretaris van Financien, Case C-20/91, 3CH 6 May 1992.
UK licences allowed to discriminate against UK fishermen
The ECJ ruled in the context of EC fishing regulations that Community states
are not precluded from imposing conditions in fishing licences granted to
their own fishermen which do not apply to fishermen from other Community
countries.
In a case involving a breach of the British licence conditions by the
masters of two British fishing vessels, the Court confirmed that the
prohibition in the Rome treaty against discrimination on grounds of
nationality does not apply where a member state chooses to discriminate
against its own nationals, even if it puts them at a commercial
disadvantage.
EC law is not concerned with disparities of treatment or distortions arising
from measures applied by one Community state which are stricter than those
applied in the same sphere by others.
The question arose in criminal proceedings brought against the two masters
by the Procurator Fiscal at Elgin for failing to report by radio their
intention to cross from one controlled fishing area to another. No similar
obligation applies to vessels flagged and registered in other EC states.
The Court added that the UK's failure to notify such a national control
measure to the European Commission in Brussels and to other Community
countries did not affect its validity as the notification was required for
information purposes only.
Procurator Fiscal, Elgin v Wood and Cowie, Joined Cases C-251/90 and
C-252/90, ECJ 6CH 7 May 1992.
Other decisions
In other decisions the Court rejected direct actions brought by two Spanish
fishing companies. They were claiming the annulment of, and damages caused
by, Commission decisions refusing to approve the award of incentive payments
for fishing trials in the south-west Atlantic under the EC rules dealing
with improvement and adaptation of fishing structures.
In areas where the Commission had a broad discretion, the applicants'
legitimate expectations were not infringed as it was predictable that the
Commission would at some point decide that there was no longer any need for
fishing trials in a particular zone.

Executives of IBM's UK subsidiary are well known for keeping in close
contact with senior civil servants in Whitehall. The latest example of the
link is Geoffrey Robinson's appointment as the chief adviser on science and
technology in the Department of Trade and Industry for a period of five
years from June.
He will succeed Ron Coleman who retired at the end of March.
Geoff Robinson, 46, is director of IBM's Hursley laboratory in Hampshire,
the group's main UK research and development centre. He is responsible for
2,000 people working mainly on computer software projects.
Robinson is the lab's second director to become a senior government
scientist. A predecessor, Sir John Fairclough, was chief scientific adviser
to the Cabinet Office from 1986 to 1990.
Another link between the two men is the Centre for the Exploitation of
Science and Technology (CEST), a London-based organisation dedicated to
improving the exploitation of research by UK industry. Fairclough is now
chairman of CEST and Robinson is a member of its policy-making council.
IBM has named Phyllis Byrne, whose entire career so far has been spent with
the company's US operations, to succeed Robinson as head of the Hursley lab.
As an American citizen, she will not be able to follow him into the British
civil service.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Addison Consultancy, which is now Britain's biggest market research company
following its takeover of AGB Research, is soon going to get a new name and
a new chairman.
But while there is little doubt about its new title - Taylor Nelson AGB -
the company remains coy about who will take over from the retiring chairman,
60-year-old Liz Nelson, one of the doyens of the market research industry.
Despite its name, the core of Addison's business is the successful Taylor
Nelson market research operation. Founded by Liz Nelson, it was bought by
Addison six years ago and was its last major acquisition, before that of
AGB.
As a result of the takeover of AGB, which has trebled the size of the
company and been financed by a very big rights issue, the composition of the
Addison board is changing.
Two AGB directors, Mike Kirkham, 45, who had been managing director of AGB
Television Worldwide, and Stephan Buck, 55, formerly AGB's group research
director, have been appointed directors of the enlarged group.
Kirkham becomes managing director and assumes day-to-day responsibility for
the audits division and Buck, who will be a non-executive director, will
focus on further development of the TV measurement and continuous panel
activities.
Apart from finding a replacement for Liz Nelson, it is expected that the
number of French directors on the board will be reduced now that the
shareholding of Virtus, a French market research firm, has been diluted from
26.06 per cent to 8.02 per cent.

unless a range of problems which have emerged in their first two years are
addressed, a study* by Warwick Business School suggests.
'Tecs have been given a job to reverse a century of training neglect in this
country but have been left on their own with limited, contractually-tied
resources to accomplish this task. This is a recipe for early loss of
credibility and disillusionment,' it concludes.
A survey of 18 of the first Tecs to be established revealed that they had
made a serious study of their local labour markets to see what help was
needed. But their proposals for action displayed a lack of proper analysis
and a reliance on existing government schemes which they had been delegated
to manage.
The study also queried whether the Tecs would be able to stick to their
long-term plans in the light of this lack of analysis, the impact of the
economic cycle and short-term government policy changes.
There was little evidence of how the Tecs would involve other local
organisations in their plans to achieve a truly comprehensive approach. Few
of their strategic plans distinguished between services the Tecs themselves
would provide and those which they would merely co-ordinate.
The study also queried whether the Tecs would be able to persuade companies
to spend their own money on training. Ninety per cent of Tec funding relates
to existing government training programmes.
There is a danger that the strategic planning objectives of the Tecs will be
overshadowed with a preoccupation with the delivery of existing government
programmes.

FT  12 MAY 92 / Parliament and Politics: 'Positive' move on stadia plans
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MPs PRESSED the government last night to rethink plans to make all soccer
clubs install all-seat stadia by the turn of the century.
Mr Tom Pendry, chairman of the all-party parliamentary football committee,
said it had received a 'very positive response' from Mr David Mellor, the
national heritage secretary, whose department has responsibility for sport.
The prime minister, like Mr Mellor a supporter of Chelsea, is understood to
be ready to reconsider rules that require Third and Fourth Division clubs to
install seats by 1999. It is unlikely that he will shift from his insistence
on all-seat stadia for clubs in the top two divisions by 1994.
The government backed Lord Justice Taylor's recommendation for scrapping
terracing after the 1989 Hillsborough disaster.
The committee argued yesterday that league clubs had spent millions of
pounds on safety improvements at a time when they were facing escalating
policing costs.

FT  12 MAY 92 / Accounting change highlighted
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MORE companies are adopting the controversial practice of not depreciating
fixed assets such as buildings, an analysis by Company Reporting, the
Edinburgh-based accounts monitoring service, indicated yesterday.
It said that 22 per cent of a sample of 630 companies showed in their latest
annual accounts evidence of assets that were not depreciated.
The practice appears to be taken for granted by water companies, which do
not depreciate infrastructure assets such as water mains, sewers, pipelines
and reservoirs. Other companies with the same approach include many in the
leisure and brewing sectors.
Accounting standard SSAP 12 stipulates that a charge for depreciation should
be shown in the profit-and-loss account for assets with a finite economic
life - including for buildings.
However, the Financial Reporting Review Panel, the policing arm of the UK's
new accounting standards regime, appeared to endorse the practice of
non-depreciation on certain assets when it cleared Forte, the hotels group,
of breaching that standard in February.
The water companies argue that they are required to maintain their
infrastructure in perpetuity and that therefore the assets do not have a
finite life.
Almost 20 per cent of companies do not disclose reasons for not depreciating
their assets.

FT  12 MAY 92 / New credit fall shown: Borrowing figures contradict
pre-election economic upturn theory
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DEMAND for credit by consumers was weak in the first quarter, according to
government figures released yesterday which did little to support theories
about economic upturn before the general election.
According to the Central Statistical Office, consumers repaid a net Pounds
270m on credit agreements between January and March, the largest quarterly
repayment since records began in 1975.
In the final quarter of last year there was a seasonally adjusted repayment
of a revised Pounds 16m, while in the previous quarter net new borrowing
came to Pounds 234m.
The period between October last year and March marks the first time since
1975 in which consumers have made net repayments on this type of credit for
two consecutive quarters.
The figures underline the weakness in the economy that was behind the
government's decision last week to reduce interest rates by 0.5 of a point
to 10 per cent. However, the Conservatives' election victory may have
provoked a spurt in economic activity that has yet to show up in statistics.
Yesterday's figures apply to virtually all forms of consumer credit except
mortgages. On March 31, Pounds 52.8bn was outstanding on such credit,
compared with Pounds 53.07bn at the end of last year.
In the first quarter, consumers repaid loans on bank personal accounts worth
Pounds 249m, the first quarter since records started to have shown a
repayment. Between October and December last year, net new loans on personal
accounts came to Pounds 100m.
Net new borrowings in the first quarter on credit cards came to Pounds 125m,
little changed from the Pounds 133m registered in the final three months of
last year.
A breakdown of the data shows that in March consumers repaid Pounds 69m on
the so-called narrow measure of credit - which accounts for about 60 per
cent of all credit and fails to include bank loans on personal accounts, and
loans on credit cards outside the Mastercard and Visa systems. It also
excludes loans from insurance companies and retailers.

FT  12 MAY 92 / British Coal to improve pensions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TRUSTEES of British Coal's pension fund are to use Pounds 1bn of a surplus
of nearly Pounds 1.5bn to improve pensions to mineworkers before
privatisation.
The move would ensure that the increases could not be reduced by any new
owner of British Coal.
A plan backed by the mining unions involves 70 per cent of the surplus being
used to improve the scheme and 30 per cent allowing British Coal to extend
its contributions holiday from 1994 until the year 2000.
The company announced in December that the trustees of the Mineworkers
Pension Scheme were considering how to share out a Pounds 1.491bn surplus.
Benefits to members include a 25 per cent service credit for contributors,
and an increase in the accruals rate - the fraction of final salary used to
determine pensions - from 80ths to 60ths for those who opt to forgo a lump
sum. The normal pension age will be reduced from 62 to 60.

AN INDUSTRIAL tribunal claim by Miss Alison Halford, an assistant chief

Lawyers for Mr James Sharples, Merseyside chief constable, had applied for
an adjournment so that an appeal over admissibility of evidence could be
heard in 10 days.
Mr Eldred Tabachnik QC, for Miss Halford, described the adjournment request
as 'intolerable and indeed cruel'. He added: 'We are very concerned that the
chief constable is seeking to stall these proceedings and that he is
exploiting every possible legal opportunity in order to delay the hearing.'
Miss Halford has alleged that in nine applications for deputy chief

FT  12 MAY 92 / Lloyd's faces threat of fresh legal action
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LLOYD'S OF LONDON faces fresh legal action in the next few days.
The Gooda Walker Action Group plans a 'radical' new case, while the
Distressed Names LMX Spiral Action Group, a new Names' pressure group formed
last month aims to issue writs against managing and members' agents at the
insurance market before May 15.
The Distressed Names LMX Spiral Action Group is seeking support from several
thousand Names who face multi-million-pound insurance losses as a result of
their membership of syndicates that specialised in spiral reinsurance
business - in which syndicates and London market companies reinsured each
others' catastrophe exposures. Losses by spiral syndicates, managed by
agencies such as Rose Thomson Young and Gooda Walker, may account for more
than half of the total Lloyd's market loss of between Pounds 1.35bn and
Pounds 2bn for 1989, which the market will report next month.
In a letter to the group's Names, Withers, the solicitors, says that they
appear to have a 'prima facie' case of negligence against both managing
agencies and members' agents who failed to 'give proper warning' to Names of
the 'immense dangers of underwriting LMX spiral business'.
The recommendation is based on initial advice from Mr Gavin Lightman QC. The
group is seeking further advice about the chances of obtaining an injunction
that would prevent Lloyd's from drawing down on Names' deposits in order to
meet cash calls.
The Gooda Walker Action Group, which represents 2,100 Names, is lending
financial support to the Distressed Names action but is also planning two
initiatives of its own.
According to its chairman, Mr Alfred Doll-Steinberg, Gooda Names hope to
present a case next week based on 'radically new grounds'. That would be
'utterly different' to the case pursued earlier this year on behalf of 800
Names.
Last month the Names failed to win injunctions - on the ground that the cash
calls against them were legally improper - after a ruling by Mr Justice
Saville in the Commercial Court.
Twenty-four Conservative MPs - including ministers - are named in a Commons
motion as having been members of the loss-making catastrophe syndicates. The
motion tabled by Mr Peter Hain, Labour MP for Neath, calls on Mr Michael
Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, to 'institute a full public
inquiry into insider dealing, financial mismanagement and corruption in
Lloyd's and to demand wholesale reform and independent regulation, bearing
in mind that if even half these 24 colleagues of his are indeed declared
bankrupt the government could lose its majority'.

FT  12 MAY 92 / Travel agents dubbed 'incompetent and lazy'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN THORNHILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MANY TRAVEL agents are 'incompetent and lazy' and waste money by making
basic errors and giving sloppy advice, according to a report from Which?,
the Consumers' Association magazine, published today.
The magazine says more than half its inquiries at 253 travel agents in 10
cities were handled badly, with agents telling half-truths and quoting
unnecessarily high fares.
Only one in five agents was able to find the cheapest routine flight to Nice
 -a Pounds 129 special offer from British Airways. A branch of AT Mays in
Manchester assured a researcher that a Pounds 244 Air France flight was the
cheapest available; the eight Lunn Poly branches in Glasgow quoted five
different fares.
Three out of five agents were unable to give satisfactory information about
holidays in Mykonos and two out of five provided less than useful advice
about Majorca, one of the most popular holiday destinations.
Which? says, however, that some agents performed with great competence and
spent much time finding the best deals. It says Hogg Robinson provided the
best service of the five big travel chains. Mays.

FT  12 MAY 92 / Better scrutiny of Scots law is urged
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT should enable specifically Scottish legislation to be given
better and more detailed consideration, according to the journal of the Law
Society of Scotland, which represents Scotland's 8,000 solicitors.
The society says the government should 'give power to some body' for the
better consideration of Scottish legislation. This body could be a Scottish
parliament, an assembly, the Commons committee on Scottish affairs or the
Scottish grand committee, which is the committee of all Scottish MPs. The
society believes most Scottish lawyers would object to the creation of an
extra tier of government in Scotland and to the issuing of more Scottish
legislation.
The Edinburgh-based society, a statutory body, has not taken part in the
constitutional debate since the late 1970s.
The government is likely to examine the option of giving more power to the
Commons committee, which was not formed in the last parliament, and to
strengthening the Scottish grand committee, which meets occasionally in
Edinburgh as well as London. There has been speculation that it might create
some forum without tax-raising powers.

FT  12 MAY 92 / World Trade News: Textile makers warn on Asian exports to US
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID DODWELL, World Trade Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ASIA'S textile exports to the US will grow twice as fast over the coming
decade as the US textiles market itself, US textile manufacturers argue in
their latest volley against proposed reforms of the multi-fibre arrangement
(MFA) regulating world trade in textiles.
According to a survey commissioned by the American Textile Manufacturers
Institute (ATMI), Asian quotas will grow by 5.77bn sq metres over 10 years
from 7.9bn sq m in 1993 to 13.7bn in 2002. This would account for 74.1 per
cent of all quotas entering the US market, if proposals in the draft
agreement on the Uruguay Round of world trade talks are put into effect.
'The Uruguay Round shuts the door on the developing countries of the world
that the US is committed to help so that the Far East manufacturers can add
to their wealth,' said Mr Carlos Moore, ATMI executive vice-president.
'India and Pakistan will get some benefits from abolition of the MFA, but
China is going to be the dominant supplier.'
Mr Moore's first concern is closer to home: protection of US textile
industry jobs. In a report published two months ago, the ATMI warned the
phased dismantling of the MFA quota system under Uruguay Round proposals
would cut US domestic output of textiles and apparel from 18bn sq m to 3bn
sq m by the year 2001. US jobs in the industry would be cut from 1.76m now,
to 300,000 in 2001, the report claimed.
In a draft agreement for the long-delayed Uruguay Round, it is proposed that
textiles come for the first time under the General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade (Gatt). Over a 10-year period, quota arrangements that have for 40
years controlled world trade in textiles will be dismantled. US textile
lobbyists want the transition period to be extended to 15 years to give US
manufacturers time to adjust.
The ATMI study argues that Asia's quotas, principally held by China, Taiwan,
South Korea and Hong Kong, will grow at about twice the rate of the US
market. Against Asia's quota growth of 5.77bn sq m, the US market is
expected to grow at 1.5 per cent a year, increasing demand by 2.92bn sq m to
just under 33bn sq m.
It shows Asia providing 14 of the top 20 textile exporters to the US market.
Only Turkey and Mexico squeeze into the top 10. 'Just three Far East
countries, China, India and Pakistan, will have greater quota for access to
the US textile and apparel market than Eastern Europe, Africa, South
America, Central America, the Caribbean, Mexico, Central and Eastern Europe,
and Russia combined,' Mr Moore said.
This latest study reflects an attempt to widen the appeal of ATMI lobbying
against the draft Uruguay Round text by targeting the concerns of non-Asian
exporters to the US.

</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US STEEL traders will today urge the government to resume multilateral steel
talks in the hope of heading off a huge filing of dumping cases.
Mr John Griffin, president of the American Institute for International
Steel, is asking the US to work 'vigorously' to back the talks, which broke
down on March 31 without an agreement on limiting trade-distorting
practices. Institute members, which import and export steel, fear
retaliation by nations hit by anti-dumping or countervailing duties.
The six largest US integrated steel producers said yesterday they were
starting 'consultations' with the US government before cases were filed
against 'unfairly traded' steel products. The companies, USX-US Steel,
Bethlehem, LTV, National, Inland and Armco, said a decision on the timing of
the filing was expected soon.
Reports are circulating in Washington that 87 complaints have been prepared
against 20 nations for alleged dumping of flat-rolled and plate steel.
Bethlehem and CR&amp;I Steel have filed petitions alleging dumping of steel rail
from Japan, Luxembourg and the UK.
The two contend that because of the dumping, the domestic share of the US
steel rail market has fallen by an average 9 per cent a year from 1989 to
1991. They are seeking duties of almost 40 per cent on steel rail from
Japan, 24.4 per cent on rail from Luxembourg, and 50.6 per cent on UK rail.
Mr Griffin says US steel exports last year rose by 47.5 per cent (2m
tonnes), while imports fell by 1.4m tonnes, a trend continuing in January
and February this year. 'In these circumstances, injury will be difficult to
prove for US mills,' he said.
The EC has urged American companies not to return to 'practices of
harassment bitterly experienced by US trading partners in 1982 and 1984' and
asked the US government to be 'severe in the examination of anti-dumping'.

Ministers from Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia hailed the accords as a step on

Baltic states the benefits they briefly had under the EC's 1990 trade and
co-operation accord with the Soviet Union, would be followed by eventual
talks on free trade with Brussels. But Baltic ministers said that while
Russian troops remained on their soil, Russia should not be 'integrated'

FT  12 MAY 92 / White House battle for Bush's ear: Los Angeles' riots have
forced the president into a policy reappraisal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONCE upon a time, long before Dan Quayle and Pat Buchanan ran for anything
national and when George Bush was thought to be a Republican moderate, Jack
Kemp was the spiritual heir of Ronald Reagan's brand of free market
conservatism. In 1988 he even planned a bid for the presidency to keep the
flame alight.
The current US housing secretary, former congressman and football
quarterback from Buffalo - but born and raised in Los Angeles - still thinks
he is that heir.
In a television interview on Sunday, one of many he has given since his home
town erupted, he said what America's inner cities needed was 'a
conservative-based, anti-poverty programme designed to empower people,
designed to give them jobs, and educational choice and home ownership'.
The difference from 1988 is that these days Mr Kemp uses the word
'bipartisan' as a preface to everything he utters. And what this new urban
messiah says often seems more in tune with what the Democrats who run most
of the country's big cities want than what the Republican administration in
which he serves is prepared to countenance.
'It is no secret', he told a group of foreign journalists last week, 'that I
am not the president's closest adviser.' But it is also the case, as Mr Bush
contemplates what he will do for the cities in the wake of Los Angeles, that
today Mr Kemp is a man the president can no longer ignore.
There is a real war for the president's ear inside the current
administration. It pits Mr Kemp's vision of government activism, broadly in
line with that espoused by Mr Michael Heseltine in Britain, against the more
conventional law-and-order views associated with Vice-President Quayle and
Mr Buchanan, a right-wing commentator.
How Mr Bush resolves the conflict could affect his re-election chances.
Yesterday, for example, a New York Times-CBS opinion poll found 60 per cent
of 1,253 adults surveyed believed the nation was spending too little on
urban problems and only 15 per cent too much.
the way Mr Bush was handling race relations and 46 per cent were
dissatisfied with his specific responses to Los Angeles. This may be
contrasted with the overwhelming support given his handling of last year's
national 'crisis', the Gulf war.
There may be consolation for the president in the fact that those polled did
not think that either Governor Bill Clinton of Arkansas, the presumptive
Democratic candidate, or Mr Ross Perot, the prospective independent, would
have done any better. But it showed some tightening of the presidential
race, with Mr Bush at 36 per cent, Mr Clinton 30 per cent and Mr Perot 25
per cent, against the 38-28-23 per cent split shown in an April survey.
It is also possible that the problems of the inner cities will fade as an
election issue by November. Mr Nelson Polsby, a political historian from the
University of California, wrote in the New York Times on Sunday that the
frequently-made comparisons with the riot-ridden year of 1968, which
resulted in the election of Mr Richard Nixon and Mr Spiro Agnew on a strong
law-and-order ticket, might be invalid.
'Even dramatic events', he wrote, 'frequently have a short shelf-life,'
which is certainly the case with the Gulf war. He argued that the most
profound political event of that year was not the urban riots but the
assassination of Robert Kennedy, which fatally weakened the Democratic
party.
Mr Bush, however, is in all matters domestic essentially a reactive
president disinclined to take the longer view, as his variable responses to
Los Angeles have demonstrated. Later this week he is going to lay out what
he thinks should be done now.
Mr Kemp concedes he will not be given a fistful of dollars to do the job. In
his view 'it's not how much money you spend as much as how you spend it'. He
accepts that the safety net of the Great Society programmes of the 1960s
should remain in place, though some could be reformed, and that 'they did
not cause the Los Angeles riots'.
He wants instead to build 'ladders out of poverty' for inner-city residents
through enterprise zones, home ownership, entrepreneurship, job training and
educational choice. Federal enterprise zones, which already exist in many
states, were an ingredient in last year's tax bill, vetoed by the president
because it also included some tax increases.
This must be set against the views of Mr Quayle, also interviewed
extensively on Sunday. The differences lie in the emphasis more than in the
substance, with the vice-president also subscribing to much of Mr Kemp's
specific agenda. But he would spend more on law enforcement and on building
prisons, and less on the social safety net.
'The philosophy and ideology of the Great Society, preaching entitlement and
dependency, has to change,' according to Mr Quayle. 'We need to have
security. If you're going to have fear in the cities, businesses aren't
going to go down there and invest.'
Having been a lonely figure in the Bush administration for three years,
trying to breath life into a moribund and scandal-ridden department and
unable to stop a steady decline in federal funding for the cities, Mr Kemp
cannot be sanguine that the president will bring him in completely from the
policy-making cold.
But at least he has emerged from the national political shadows into the
mainstream of the inner-city debate.
Even Mr Clinton, whose own views are not a million miles from Mr Kemp's, has
taken to praising him as the lone voice of reason inside the administration,
which is a far cry from anything imaginable just four years ago.

MEXICO recorded a trade deficit of Dollars 1.38bn (Pounds 772m) in February,
bringing the deficit for the first two months of the year to Dollars 2.59bn.
The figures suggest the annual deficit, on current trends, will be close to
Dollars 16bn, far above official government forecasts and nearly Dollars 5bn
more than last year.
However, the deficit's rate of growth has slowed and may have levelled off.
For the past four months the monthly deficit has hovered between Dollars
1.2bn and Dollars 1.4bn.
February's deficit falls to Dollars 1.04bn if revenues from maquiladoras
(in-bond plants) are included. While revenues from oil exports have fallen,
manufacturing exports rose to Dollars 1.3bn in February, 23 per cent more
than a year earlier. Imports climbed to Dollars 3.46bn, an increase of 29
per cent on February 1991.
In the short-term Mexico can easily finance its widening trade gap as
reserves are estimated to top Dollars 20bn and foreign capital continues to
roll in.

THE government of Sao Paulo, Brazil's largest and richest state, is
launching a programme to privatise its public services.
Mr Luis Antonio Fleury, state governor, said he was seeking private funding
for the maintenance and operation of existing services, as well as the
construction of new public works on a concession basis.
The first stages of the programme, approved last week by the state
legislature, would include privatisation of the road network, water
treatment plants, small energy generation projects, and expansion in the use
of natural gas, the river transport system and inter-municipality bus
services.
The programme is open to foreign participation. Mr Fleury said there had
already been interest from Canadian, French, Spanish and British companies,
including Northwest Water. Most were planning to bid in a consortium with
Brazilian companies.
He had received offers of finance from foreign banks as the projects would
be a private, rather than state, initiative. Tenders for concessions will be
offered in 30 days for international bids.
Sao Paulo is the centre of Brazilian industry and has a GDP of about Dollars
170bn (Pounds 96bn) - 39 per cent of the national total and more than that
of Argentina. Its population is 31m.
Explaining the decision to privatise, Mr Fleury said the state no longer had
the capacity to invest in public works. 'There are two ways to overcome this
 -putting up taxes, which is not feasible, or privatising.'
In the initial stages alone, the programme would save the state Dollars
600m.

<TEXT>
THE conservative government of New South Wales, Australia's most populous
state, suffered a serious blow yesterday when a senior minister told a
hearing into corruption allegations he would resign.
Mr Tim Moore, environment minister in the Liberal/National party coalition
government, said he was resigning for personal reasons, and would leave
parliament before the next state election, due in 1995.
Mr Moore made his announcement on the first day of an inquiry by the state's
Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) into the appointment of Mr
Terry Metherell, an independent MP, to a senior public service job.
Mr Moore played a key role in the appointment, which has been described as
'a straight political deal' by Mr Nick Greiner, the state premier. The
government subsequently won a by-election in Mr Metherell's safe
conservative seat.
Mr Greiner, Mr Metherell and Mr Moore all deny any impropriety. However, Mr
Greiner has been censured by parliament, and the ICAC is investigating
opposition claims that Mr Metherell voted with the government on an
important bill in return for the job.
The coalition government controls only 48 seats in the 99-seat parliament,
compared with 47 held by the Labor opposition. It relies on the support of
four independent MPs to remain in office.
The independent MPs say they will demand Mr Greiner's resignation if he is
criticised by the ICAC report. If the premier refused to go, the
independents say they would put Labor into power.

achieve compromise

<TEXT>
PROTESTERS called a truce in their week-long demonstration in the Thai
capital yesterday, but said they would return next weekend to make sure a
compromise reached on Saturday was implemented.
The main issue still to be resolved is whether Gen Suchinda Kraprayoon, the
unelected prime minister, will have to leave office soon.
The protesters, whose numbers reached 100,000 over the weekend, accused him
of trying to increase the military's domination of Thai politics, and have
been calling for his immediate resignation.
The prime minister said yesterday he would accept whatever parliament
decided. A key point in the compromise agreed by nine governments and
opposition parties on Saturday, is an amendment to the constitution that
would prevent the appointment of a prime minister from outside the House of
Representatives.
This would force Gen Suchinda, who engineered last year's coup d'etat and
was army chief until he was appointed prime minister last month, to leave
office or seek election. Asked if he would stand in a by-election, he
insisted he would not.
Maj Gen Chamlong Srimuang, the opposition leader who ended his hunger strike
on Saturday, told the crowd to go home, get some rest and return to their
jobs. A new rally is planned for Sunday.
Maj Gen Chamlong said yesterday an interim provision should allow Gen
Suchinda to remain as caretaker prime minister for no more than 15 days
after the amendments take effect to allow a new premier to be picked.
But one government party leader said it would be wrong to dismiss Gen
Suchinda hurriedly since he was chosen constitutionally by a majority in the
elected House of Representatives.
The government parties could try to extend Gen Suchinda's premiership by
proposing an interim measure that would allow him to stay in office for much
longer, perhaps until the next election.
The parliamentary process of amending the constitution could itself take a
month or more.
The stock market reacted with relief to the easing of tension after a
month-long crisis. Its share price index rose 41.81 to 774.70, recovering
much of the ground it had lost over the past week.

FT  12 MAY 92 / Lawyer joins frontrunners in Manila polls
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MRS Miriam Defensor Santiago, an outspoken lawyer, emerged yesterday as one
of the early frontrunners for the Philippine presidency after a heavy
turnout in the country's national and local elections.
By last night, however, only a fraction of the votes had been counted in
preliminary unofficial tallies, and Mrs Santiago was joined at the top of
the league of seven presidential candidates by Mr Eduardo Cojuangco, an
associate of the late dictator Ferdinand Marcos, and Mr Fidel Ramos, the
former defence chief.
Slow returns from remote provinces could change the picture, and official
results are not expected for days. About 80 per cent of the country's 32m
voters are estimated to have gone to the polls.
Eleven people were reported killed throughout the islands in scattered
election violence, bringing the total number of deaths in the campaign to
more than 50, but officials expressed satisfaction at the relatively orderly
conduct; over 140 people died in local elections four years ago.
Mrs Santiago, a former judge and immigration commissioner, has endeared
herself to the poorer voters of Manila for her outspoken condemnation of
corruption, but her economic polices are vague and she has been accused of
mental instability by her opponents.
As she cast her vote, the 46-year-old Mrs Santiago confidently predicted she
would win a landslide victory. 'There's an almost palpable thrill of
excitement running through the country today,' she said.
Mr Ramos, aged 64, was vigorously supported by Mrs Corazon Aquino, the
outgoing president. He enforced martial law under Marcos, but helped Mrs
Aquino come to power by switching sides in the 1986 revolution and has since
protected her from six coup attempts.
Voters yesterday were faced with the task of writing down up to 44 names on
their ballot papers for the presidential, congressional and local elections.
Some - including presidential hopeful Mrs Imelda Marcos, widow of Ferdinand
 -looked like worried examination candidates as they took more than the
allotted 20 minutes to complete the forms; others gave up the unequal task.
Canvassers handed out thousands of sample ballot papers for Filipinos to
copy in the polling booths, and by the end of the day voters were wading
through heaps of discarded crib sheets.
The atmosphere in Manila was calm and cheerful but violence was reported
from the troubled southern island of Mindanao and elsewhere. In one
incident, three body guards of a provincial governor were shot dead by
troops when they tried to enter a polling station.
Mrs Aquino reflected the national mood when she said she felt fulfilled
'because we restored democracy and we are able to hold our elections in a
very peaceful and orderly manner'.

FT  12 MAY 92 / Bangkok shows its anger at the generals' grip on power: Why
the people of Thailand have taken to mass protest
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER UNGPHAKORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Thai media calls them the country's 'yuppie revolutionaries'. They drove
in their new Japanese and German cars to express their resentment against
the military domination of politics. They used their mobile telephones to
call their friends and relatives to join last week's demonstrations and to
berate radio phone-in hosts.
In reality the crowds that protested round the clock for a week, swelling to
as much as 100,000 two nights running at the weekend, were much more of a
cross-section of Thai society than the colourful reports suggest. In a
country that is usually politically apathetic, their numbers have surprised
analysts.
The end of the protests yesterday was described as a truce. Another rally
has been called for Sunday to make sure compromises reached over the weekend
are implemented.
Urban Thais are much more internationally-minded than 20 years ago. They
have become accustomed to a free press, and resent military interference in
civilian affairs. More elected politicians now have the confidence to
confront the generals directly. Following the end of the cold war and the
easing of conflict in Cambodia, the military have difficulty in claiming
they are needed to combat a security threat.
The protests were not only about principles: the fact that Gen Suchinda
Kraprayoon was appointed prime minister without having stood in the March 22
general election is only part of the story.
Demonstrators also applauded loudly when speakers criticised Gen Suchinda's
brother-in-law, Gen Issarapong Noonpakdi, who last month replaced him as
army commander, and Gen Kaset Rojananil, the air force chief who succeeded
Gen Suchinda as armed forces supreme commander.
The three were contemporaries in military academies and have worked together
closely for years. They are now being accused of nepotism, seeking to
further business interests, and it is claimed they created the five-party
coalition that supports the prime minister.
The fact that the Thai political climate has changed since the last large
demonstrations in the 1970s was not entirely recognised by the military,
although Gen Suchinda has had to rely on parliamentary support in order to
claim legitimacy.
In a propaganda campaign against the protesters, the military resorted to
speeches and announcements that increased public anxiety. Radio and
television, was heavily censored, sometimes issuing false information. This
merely infuriated a large section of public opinion in Bangkok where critics
of the government were easily able to find out what was happening.
The errors almost cost the prime minister his two-week-old job because of
the upsurge in opposition. In any case, as a result of the week end
compromise, the former army commander who left the military to take up the
premiership may have to resign sooner than he planned.
The government parties have now agreed to amend the constitution to prevent
a non-elected prime minister from taking office. When the amendment takes
effect Gen Suchinda will not be able to continue in office unless he seeks
election.
Last Thursday he inflamed public resentment by making a brief and
belligerent speech that revived cold war images of the 1970s. He said he had
accepted the premiership in order to be an impartial leader for the
five-party coalition, and in order to protect the country from two dangerous
opposition leaders. He accused Gen Chavalit Yongchaiyudh, his predecessor as
army commander who left the military to run for parliament, of seeking to
set up a 'praesidium' style of government - in other words of being a
communist.
And he said true Buddhists had asked him to defend the religion against the
deviant faith of Maj Gen Chamlong Srimuang, the former governor of Bangkok.
Maj Gen Chamlong, who was on hunger strike outside parliament at that
moment, has gained immense popularity in the capital because of his modest,
moral lifestyle.
Although Gen Suchinda's tone has moderated since then, he still accuses
protesters of trying to overthrow the government, and he uses a Thai phrase
that has connotations verging on 'treason'.
The irony has not been lost on the protesters who are only demanding his
resignation - Gen Suchinda was one of the leaders of the coup d'etat last
year that overthrew the elected government of Gen Chatichai Choonhavan.
Five government and four opposition parties have agreed that four provisions
of the constitution drafted last year under military domination would be
changed:
The prime minister would have to be an elected MP;
The appointed Senate would no longer be able to participate in no-confidence
debates and could only delay legislation it considers unwise;
The president of parliament, who plays an important role in selecting the
prime minister, would be the speaker of the elected House of Representatives
instead of the president of the appointed Senate;
MPs would be allowed to table motions and question ministers during the
second session of parliament in each year - under present provisions this is
possible only during the first session.
When they finally dispersed in the early hours of yesterday morning, the
protesters gave government parties one week to study details of the proposed
constitutional amendments and say when the changes would come into force.
Already there are signs some government parties could try to delay
implementation. The protests could thus begin afresh.

THE Indian government is pursuing possible fraud charges against senior
executives of state owned banks involved in a securities trading scandal.
Dr Manmohan Singh, finance minister, told the Indian parliament yesterday
that the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) had been asked to examine
trading in bankers' receipts by State Bank of India, the largest of the
state owned banks, as well as by National Housing Bank and United Commercial
Bank. Bankers' receipts are promissory notes issued by banks to register the
transfer of government securities.
Senior government officials said yesterday that bogus paper had been traded
and that the police had been called in to pursue fraud charges. Funds from
trading in bankers receipts were syphoned into the stock market and helped
fuel the recent share price boom.
The Bombay Stock Exchange index - which has fallen 18 per cent over the last
two weeks - slid a further 237.95 to 3,420.05 in nervous trading.
Institutions were reported to have intervened to stabilise prices.
Mr S. Venkitaramanan, the governor of the Reserve Bank of India, the central
bank, confirmed that several officials of the three banks had been suspended
or asked to take immediate leave.
Apart from MH Pherwani, who resigned as chairman of National Housing Bank on
Saturday, Mr K Margabandhu, chairman of United Commercial Bank, and Mr CL
Khemani, deputy managing director of State Bank of India, have also been
asked to take leave.
Among others under investigation is Mr Harshad Mehta, a prominent Bombay
broker and a leading 'bull' on the market who was recently forced to settle
outstanding accounts with State Bank for Rs6.2bn (Pounds 120m).
The Reserve Bank governor yesterday used a gathering with bankers to ask
them to establish banks' total exposure in what is being described as
India's worst financial scandal. Bankers informally say that banks' exposure
to irregularities in the securities market could be Rs30bn-Rs40bn.
Dr Singh told parliament that the Reserve Bank had established a prima facie
case against the three banks named in the securities scandal.

A senior Iranian official yesterday predicted that a sweeping victory in
parliamentary elections for supporters of Iran's President Hashemi
Rafsanjani would strengthen economic liberalisation in Iran, Tony Walker
reports from Tehran.
Mr Ali Akbar Velayati, Iran's foreign minister, told the Financial Times
that 'getting a majority in the parliament'would help Mr Rafsanjani
implement his reforms. He was speaking as final results in elections for
Iran's 270-member parliament were announced. The results confirmed earlier
reports of a landslide victory for Mr Rafsanjani's supporters throughout the
country, and a rout of his radical opponents.
Mr Velayati said Iran's president would now press ahead with completing the
country's 1989-94 five-year economic development plan which placed
particular emphasis on reconstruction following the eight-year war with
Iran.
Mr Rafsanjani, president since July 1989, encountered resistance to his
reformist policies from the old parliament which was dominated by radicals
elected in 1988 while Ayatollah Khomeini was still alive.
According to Tehran Radio, 268 of the 270 parliamentary seats have been
finalised. Voting in two electorates had been declared null and void.
Rafsanjani supporters appear to have made their strongest showing in Tehran.

FT  12 MAY 92 / Elections speed Tehran's farewell to the ghost of Khomeini:
Anti-US slogans disappearing from the capital's walls indicate a readiness
to consider relations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By COLIN BARRACLOUGH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ANTI-US slogans still emblazon Tehran's walls, and Friday prayers at the
University of Tehran kick off as usual with the regulation chant of 'Death
to America'.
But the slogans are fast disappearing. Mr Gholam Hossein Karbaschi, the new
city mayor, has despatched clean-up squads to remove the worst of the
graffiti. His employees apparently read the slogans and decide which are
just too good to remove. Any that fail the test are summarily whitewashed.
Iran's estrangement from the world economy is drawing to an end. Non-oil
exports doubled this year, trade with Europe and Japan reached record
heights, and supporters of reformist President Hashemi Rafsanjani scored a
runaway success in parliamentary elections.
In fact, reform is so advanced in Tehran that there is even talk of a
rapprochement with the Great Satan, the US. Even to whisper the word America
is risky, but several signals from Tehran point to a willingness to consider
relations.
Trade with US companies, conducted largely through intermediaries, is
booming. One diplomat in Tehran estimated that bilateral trade between Iran
and the US amounted to Dollars 500m (Pounds 282m) during the year to March,
making the US Iran's seventh largest importer.
As far back as last September, Mr Mohammad Javad Larijani, a member of
Iran's National Security Council and an influential adviser to Mr
Rafsanjani, told the Washington Post that normal relations with the US were
'theoretically not impossible'. He said that publicly stating such a
position in Tehran had been difficult because of pressure from hardline
critics.
With the hardliners' vitriol dampened by poor election results, the way is
presumably clearer for more constructive moves.
The biggest stumbling block to restoring ties is the Dollars 10bn of Iranian
assets which Tehran claims is frozen in the US. Washington seized the money
after Iran's Islamic revolution in 1979, but it has never officially
announced the amount it is holding. Iranian claims for compensation have
been bogged down at The Hague tribunal since 1981.
There were indications of a thaw in relations last November, when Washington
released Dollars 278m for weaponry impounded by the US after the Islamic
revolution, but there has been no progress since.
Emotions in Tehran are still provoked by talk of America. Candidates in the
elections to the majlis (parliament) accused one another of harbouring
friendly sentiments towards the US.
Some candidates even mentioned better relations with the US in public
speeches, however. Mr Rajaie Khorassani, former Iranian ambassador to the
United Nations, admitted in a campaign speech in early April that restoring
diplomatic relations with America was at least a possibility. 'The experts
study and decide that it is in the interest of the Islamic republic of
Iran,' he said.
'They are arguing about the price of relations, not the principle,' said a
diplomat.
Mr Ali Akbar Velayati, the long-serving foreign minister, is more cautious.
He denies that any positive approach towards the US is possible without the
unilateral release of funds by Washington. But Mr Velayati does not always
see eye-to-eye with his president about the speed of reform in foreign
policy.
Mr Velayati is closely allied with Iran's spiritual leader, Ayatollah Ali
Khamenei, whose politics falls between the reforming camp of President
Rafsanjani and the hardline faction of Mr Mehdi Karrubi, parliamentary
speaker. The president is reported to be frustrated with the slow speed of
Iran's rapprochement with the west.
Some suggest that the US is now more hardline on rapprochement than Iran.
'The United States sees Iran as it was 13 years ago,' said one American
commentator in Tehran. 'Things have moved on since then.'
Officially, Washington is nervous about Tehran's intentions. Iran is
reported to have bought some Dollars 2bn worth of tanks, aircraft and
submarines from former Warsaw Pact countries. It is developing medium-range
missile technology with North Korea. Rumours still persist that it is trying
to secure nuclear technology from a Central Asian republic.
Tehran has a case for rearmament. It has emerged from a devastating
eight-year war against Iraq in which its stock of military hardware was all
but wiped out.
Understandably, Washington wants to tread cautiously on relations with Iran,
at least until the US presidential election in November is over. Too much
political blood has been spilled over Iran in the past decade for rash
gestures.
But a new White House might do well to take a closer look at Tehran and
recalculate its sums. An expanding economy, replete with oil, gas, minerals
and enormous potential, is hungry for investment. But if these hopes of
betterment are not fulfilled, the country could still abandon reform and
turn back to the ghost of Ayatollah Khomeini.

THE European Community said yesterday that Nigeria could not tap approved EC
grants totalling about Dollars 150m (Pounds 84.7m) until it had
International Monetary Fund approval for tough economic reforms, Reuter
reports from Lagos.
'We need the approval in order to guarantee that Nigeria will make effective
use of the money,' an EC official said.
The money in question is an Ecu83.7m General Import Programme allocation and
an Ecu40m export promotion grant.
Nigeria, in the sixth year of free market economic reforms, is negotiating a
new standby loan facility with the Fund. It does not draw on IMF facilities
but needs IMF endorsement of its reforms to claim easier terms on its
roughly Dollars 30bn foreign debt and to gain access to new funds.
The reforms were introduced by military President Ibrahim Babangida to
rescue an economy crippled by low oil prices, corruption and poor
productivity.
The IMF and Nigeria signed a 15-month, Dollars 450m credit deal in January
1991 but Lagos failed to win IMF approval last year under a mid-term review
of the accord.
It failed to meet IMF conditions such as public spending cuts and closing a
gap between official and free market exchange rates for its naira currency.
It has since taken steps to close the exchange rate gap.

FT  12 MAY 92 / No shelter in Bosnia's battle zones: The three wars raging
in the former central Yugoslav republic
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LAST Sunday, hundreds of children were evacuated to Moscow from Sarajevo,
the capital of Bosnia-Hercegovina. As they boarded buses, amid shelling and
sniper fire, their mothers started sobbing, not knowing if they would ever
see their families again.
In Bosnia, there is no shelter for children even in towns and villages. As
Serb irregulars, backed by the Yugoslav army, pound the capital with mortar
and artillery, two other wars are raging elsewhere in the republic.
In the north of Bosnia, Croat and Serb forces are fighting it out at
Bosanski Brod, a swathe of territory which runs along the river Sava and
borders Serbia and Croatia.
Control of this region is crucial for the governments of Croatia and Serbia.
If President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia captures it, he will be able to
link up with the eastern parts of Croatia, still in the hands of the federal
army, and Serb militants. Moreover, victory at Bosanski Brod would
eventually allow Serbia to link the self-proclaimed, Serb-inhabited republic
of Krajina, in south-west Croatia, with eastern Croatia. The creation of a
Greater Serbia would then be in his grasp.
Another, equally bloody war is taking place in Hercegovina, south-west of
Bosnia. The region is inhabited largely by Croats, and by Moslems and Serbs.
Croatia's National Guard, deployed along territory wedged between the
Adriatic coast and Bosnia, is determined to defend fellow-Croats.
Croatian nationalists want this part of Hercegovina annexed to Croatia. But
the war is turning the beautiful old Turkish city of Mostar, the capital of
Hercegovina, into a second Vukovar - the Croatian city which the Serb army
and irregulars flattened to the ground last year.
As a means of reaching some agreement over the future of Bosnia, Bosnia's
Serb and Croat leaders last week held secret talks in the Austrian city of
Graz. The negotiations, backed by Croatian President Franjo Tudjman and Mr
Milosevic, discussed how Bosnia-Hercegovina would be divided between them.
The Moslems, who make up 44 per cent of the republic's 4.3m population, had
no say in the talks. Any carve-up of the republic would not only leave them
without a homeland. It would put paid to pledges by both presidents to
recognise the inviolability of the borders of the former Yugoslavia.
Bosnia's Croat and Serb leaders have already started arguing over the plan,
which involves dividing Sarajevo, as well as ceding parts of Hercegovina to
Croatia, and northern parts of Bosnia to Serbia. Serbia insists on keeping
control of the valley south of the river Neretva, on which Mostar is built -
there are sizeable arms production enterprises here. If it does, the
medieval Croatian city of Dubrovnik, south-west of Mostar, would probably be
permanently cut off from Croatia proper.
That is why a victory at Mostar is important for the Croats. It is not in
sight. At the weekend, Belgrade started deploying the federal army's elite
paratroop corps in the region.
The fighting in these two areas of Bosnia-Hercegovina has taken a terrible
toll on the population. Since Bosnia's independence was recognised by the
international community six weeks ago, over 300,000 people have been
displaced, 1,300 have been killed, and 350,000 have fled the republic. In
Sarajevo, as the federal army and Serb irregulars lay siege to the city,
starving Moslems, Serbs and Croats continue to defend their capital.
The Serbian leadership is determined to speed the capitulation of Sarajevo,
and Bosnia. The purge of the army last week, in which 38 generals were
replaced by young, ruthless Serb officers, was aimed at isolating those
generals who might have had qualms about unleashing its full fire-power on
Bosnia, and who might have resented the way in which Mr Milosevic's war aims
have destroyed Yugoslavia.
But Mr Milosevic also wants Bosnia quickly pacified in case he needs the
army to defend Serbia itself. This is the nightmare which haunts all Serbs.
Serbia is not an ethnically homogenous republic. Over 200,000 Moslems live
in the Sanjzak, a poor region which borders Bosnia and Montenegro, the tiny
republic which supports Serbia. Already, thousands of Montenegrin reservists
of the Yugoslav federal army have been dispatched to the Sanjzak to suppress
any potential unrest.
But time may be running out for Serbia. Bosnian Moslems said Mr Suleiman
Ugljanin, head of the 'Moslem National Council' in the Sanjzak, is likely to
rebel in support of his Moslem brethren in Bosnia.
A spark which inflames the Sanjzak could spread to the southern province of
Kosovo, which in 1990 was forcibly integrated into Serbia. Over the past two
years, Kosovo's ethnic Albanians, who make up 90 per cent of the population
of 2m, have been living in a virtual police state controlled by Belgrade.
In the northern province of Vojvodina, which was also annexed by Serbia in
1990, the 380,000-strong Hungarian ethnic minority is now demanding that
Serbia guarantees its ethnic rights, while the 80,000 Croats in Vojvodina
want to hold a referendum on whether to remain in Serbia.
Thus, any uprising in the Sanjzak, Kosovo, and Vojvodina would not only
stretch the Yugoslav federal army - particularly since it is still trying to
consolidate its gains in Croatia and in Bosnia. It would engulf Serbia in
civil war.
Peace efforts by the United Nations and by General Colm Doyle, the European
Community's indefatigable negotiator in Sarajevo, have failed to stop the
killing and the grab for land. 'What hope can we promise these poor people
of Bosnia?' an EC monitor said yesterday. He added that if, and when, the
fighting stops in Bosnia, 'the air will be full of revenge, the morgues will
be full of bodies, and another part of this evil Balkan war will creep into
Serbia.'

<TEXT>
TAJIK government and opposition leaders agreed yesterday to form a coalition
administration to pull their country back from the brink of civil war, a
senior Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) army officer said, Reuter
reports from Dushanbe.
'A final document has been signed calling for disarmament operations to
begin and for a cabinet of national unity to be formed to settle all
disputed issues,' said Colonel Vyacheslav Zabolotny, garrison commander in
Dushanbe, the capital.
The agreement, still to be confirmed by both sides, followed talks on Sunday
night between President Rakhmon Nabiyev, opposition leaders and the
country's senior Moslem cleric, Qazi Akbar Turazhondzade.
Col Zabolotny, who presided over the meeting at the city's army barracks,
said he had brought the two sides together to prevent further bloodshed. He
said 108 people had been killed in six weeks of conflict in the impoverished
former Soviet republic, which borders on China and Afghanistan.
Talks between government and opposition leaders continued yesterday and the
president's position was expected to be discussed.
Col Zabolotny said the new coalition government would have 24 members. Eight
key positions would go to opposition representatives, including those of
defence minister and security police chief.
Yesterday's agreement called for both sides to disarm and for a permanent
rally by thousands of Moslem and democratic opposition supporters in central
Dushanbe, in its 47th day, to disperse.
The president's position now appeared to be the only issue that could derail
a definitive settlement to the conflict that led to the collapse of the
country's conservative government last Thursday.
A refinery fire in Nizhny Novgorod, east of Moscow, has destroyed a
hydraulic oil production plant, causing problems for Russia's aviation and
other industries, Itar-Tass news agency said yesterday, Reuter reports from
Moscow.
No details of the refinery's output were available, and the cause of the
fire was unknown. The blaze destroyed 300 tonnes of oil and 100 tonnes of
paraffin, Tass said.

HUNGARY'S conservative government is to boost infrastructural spending and
accelerate privatisation in an effort to 'initiate growth in the near
future', it said yesterday.
In a significant change of tack, the cabinet decided at the weekend that
infrastructure spending would also involve using private funds to boost
investment in roads and telecommunications.
The initiative, designed to quell public impatience after two years of
recession, coincides with growing speculation about the replacement of Mr
Mihaly Kupa, the finance minister, by a more expansionist minister.
The extent of the social pain being caused by economic reforms was made all
the more clear by unemployment figures showing more than 500,000 registered
out of work in April
Nevertheless, the government is severely constrained by a spiralling
public-sector deficit. The budget was in deficit by Ft66.7bn (Pounds 471m)
in the first four months.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GERMANY yesterday questioned Britain's big European Community budget rebate,
sending an official signal that a new front may be about to open in a battle
over ambitious EC budget plans, Reuter reports from Brussels.
Ms Ursula Seiler-Albring, deputy foreign minister, was quoted as saying that
decisions on budget proposals by Mr Jacques Delors, European Commission
president, should wait until issues such as the British rebate had been
studied.
'We think other subjects must be looked at, such as the change in (EC) own
resources, Britain's rebate and the evaluation of structural funds,' a
German spokesman quoted Ms Seiler-Albring as telling EC foreign ministers
meeting in Brussels.
The Commission said last week it would soon unveil a report on the future of
Britain's refund, won by Mrs Margaret Thatcher, former British prime
minister, in 1984 after long and hard bargaining. Britain is the only member
state to get back part of its net annual contribution to the budget - a
refund worth Pounds 2.4bn in the last budget year.
The German comment was the first time the issue of the rebate had been
raised officially during three months of inconclusive debate about Mr
Delors's five-year budget plan, known as the Delors II package.
The package, designed to fund Community projects as the EC prepares for
economic and monetary union, has already divided member states. Mr Delors
wants EC annual budget commitments to be allowed to rise to around Ecu88bn
(Pounds 61.6bn) by 1997 from Ecu67bn now.
Germany and the Netherlands are also concerned Delors II would overstretch
member states' resources, but Spain, Ireland, Portugal and Greece are keen
to get promised new funds to help their poorer economies catch up with rich
EC neighbours.
Diplomats said Spain had called for a firm political decision on the Delors
budget package for the years 1993-1997 to be taken at the next EC summit,
due in Lisbon next June. But several richer countries argued for more
information before any firm decision can be taken, diplomats said.

FT  12 MAY 92 / Turkey strides firmly on to a new stage: Ankara has suddenly
found itself at the centre of things
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT MAUTHNER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE high profile visit which Mr Suleyman Demirel, Turkey's prime minister,
paid to six central Asian republics and his participation in a central Asian
summit last weekend has underlined forcefully the new role his country hopes
to play in world affairs.
No longer does Turkey see itself as merely a bridge between Europe and the
Middle East - a favoured argument deployed over the years by Ankara in
support of its application for membership of what it perceived as an
unimaginatively inward-looking European Community. The ending of the cold
war and the collapse of the Soviet Union has allowed Turkey to broaden its
horizons to an area of central Asia from which many of its people originated
and with which it retains strong ethnic, cultural, religious and linguistic
ties.
From being on the periphery of both Europe and Asia, Turkey has suddenly
found itself at the geopolitical centre of a newly emerging region. .
Suddenly, the fact that Turkey has been jilted by the EC, which has made
clear that it sees no early prospect of admitting it as a full member, is
looked upon as much less of a disaster by Turkish officials, at least in the
short term.
The emotional rhetoric that accompanied Mr Demirel's triumphal progress
through Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and
Azerbaijan, might send shivers down the spines of some Balkan states like
Greece, whose ancestral fear of Turkish expansionism and domination lies
barely quiescent at the best of times and needs little reawakening. For the
US and most of its western allies, however, the prominent role that Turkey
aspires to play in the development of the republics, is a welcome
contribution to stabilising a highly volatile region.
Though Turkey's religion is Moslem, the secular values bequeathed it in 1923
by its founder, Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, makes it the ideal mentor of the new
central Asian republics, with a similar mixed recent tradition. In that
capacity, Turkey is more acceptable in the region as an advocate of western
ideas and values than any western power is likely to be. Equally important,
it is likely to act as a bulwark against Iran, which has been making
strenuous efforts to extend both its influence and that of a more extreme
form of Islam.
Yet in spite of some grandiose pronouncements, Mr Demirel hasnot his
ambitions run away with him. Though calling for a Turkic summit in Istanbul
in the autumn, he has ruled out a formal pan-Turkic alliance for the
foreseeable future. The desire not to go it alone and, whenever possible, to
act in concert with its main allies and partners in international
organisations such as Nato and the Conference on Security and Co-operation
in Europe, continues to be a guiding principle of Turkey's foreign policy.
In the explosive dispute between Christian Armenia and Moslem Azerbaijan
over Nagorno-Karabakh, Turkey had, until last weekend, refrained from openly
backing its Moslem sister state and had attempted to play a neutral
mediating role. However, the fall of one of the last important Azeri
strongholds has forced it to adopt a more partisan stance.
The prime minister has been somewhat less cautious in his promises of
economic aid to the republics, given the need for belt-tightening demanded
by the parlous state of the domestic economy - inflation was running close
to 70 per cent last year and there is a rampant public sector deficit. The
offer of a total of Dollars 1.1bn of credits to the Moslem republics was
greeted with scepticism by Turkish Eximbank officials in Ankara, given the
state of the country's foreign exchange reserves and the incapacity of
debtor countries to provide adequate guarantees for the loans.
The limits to Turkey's regional leadership aspirations, as well as those of
Iran and Pakistan, its direct rivals for that role, became clear at the
summit of five of the republics in Ashkhabad, Turkemenistan, last weekend.
Though wide-ranging plans for economic co-operation, covering road and rail
links, oil and gas pipelines and a customs union were discussed by the five
republics and their three potential benefactors, no concrete agreements were
reached. The blocking of the plan for an oil pipeline between Kazakhstan and
the Iranian Gulf port of Bandar Abbas by both Kazakhstan and Turkey, because
of fears that it would give Iran control over central Asian oil exports, was
symptomatic of the kind of political obstacles to regional co-operation
which are likely to arise constantly.
Even in the best of circumstances, it would take a long time before Turkey
could reap any substantial benefits from what will remain, for the
foreseeable future, an essentially one-sided economic relationship.
In the short and medium term, central Asian, Black Sea regional or even
Middle Eastern links cannot constitute an alternative to membership of the
European Community, which already offers a duty-free market for 53 per cent
of Turkey's industrial exports and has provided the impetus for its economic
modernisation and political democratisation over the last decade.
The real problem is how long Turkey will have to remain on the sidelines.
For the moment, the Ankara government seems reluctantly to have come to
terms with the European Commission's December 1989 opinion that it will have
to wait until the EC has absorbed at least the European Free Trade
Association applicants and, probably, some east European countries too.
Realistically, the target date for Turkey's entry cannot be set before the
beginning of the next century. But in the meantime, steps will have to be
taken to bring Turkey closer to the Community, some of which have so far
been blocked by Greece pending a solution of the Cyprus problem. Failing an
assurance that at least the groundwork for eventual membership is being
prepared, Turkey might indeed abandon its European aspirations in favour of
the eastern promises, however insubstantial, that it is pursuing today.

<TEXT>
GERMANY yesterday despatched its first soldiers on an official basis to join
a United Nations peace-keeping expedition - 140 military medical staff to
operate a hospital in Cambodia.
The volunteers were seen off at Munich airport by Mr Volker Ruhe, the
defence minister, who promised that the German constitution would be amended
by the end of the year to allow the full participation of German soldiers in
UN peacekeeping missions.
The staff will form part of the UN Transitional Authority in Cambodia
(Untac) which will demobilise four rival armies and prepare for national
elections in April 1993.
Mr Ruhe insisted that the use of medical personnel fell within the current
law, although it is clear that the German government has been deliberately
stepping up the use of 'para-military' personnel outside the country to
prepare the population for a change in the constitution.
Mr Ruhe renewed the government's pledge to amend Bonn's post-second world
war constitution at least enough to allow German troops full participation
as UN 'blue helmets', peace-mission soldiers with sidearms only.
The medical troops are a convenient solution for Chancellor Helmut Kohl's
government, caught between its desire to play a greater world role after
German unity and a constitutional ban on deploying fighting troops outside
NATO territory.
Munich's second international airport was officially opened at a ceremony
yesterday after years of controversy and rising costs.
Planners said it would handle between 18m and 20m travellers a year by the
end of the decade.
It does not officially go into service until Sunday, but according to
official estimates, between 12m and 14m people will pass through it this
year.

FT  12 MAY 92 / German trade surplus soars to DM4.9bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
INDUSTRY'S efforts to soften the impact of looming strikes helped boost
German exports to new records during March. Overseas sales of goods surged
unexpectedly to DM63bn (Pounds 21.4bn) from DM55bn in February, and the
federal trade surplus more than doubled to DM4.9bn, the statistical office
said yesterday. Imports rose 10 per cent to DM58bn.
'We saw the same in 1984 before the last big metal workers' strike,'
Commerzbank said. Then, manufacturers shipped finished products into
overseas distribution networks and built up stocks of imported components as
they braced themselves for what developed into a two-month stoppage.
Meanwhile, the leadership of the IG Metall engineering union pressed on with
plans for official strike action as 42,000 members staged warning stoppages,
mainly around Nuremberg.
Mechanical and electrical engineering companies such as AEG, Bosch, Siemens
and MAN bore the brunt. Employers made no advance on their 3.3 per cent pay
offer at talks with union officials in the Hesse region yesterday.
A meeting of union leaders in Frankfurt this morning is expected to choose
targets for the main official action. Last time, when the issue was shorter
working hours, strikes in the south halted virtually all motor manufacture.
Most car and truck makers, Germany's leading exporters, have since switched
to just-in-time manufacturing processes. They routinely hold low stocks of
components and rely on round-the-clock deliveries from suppliers to keep
production lines running.
Because a breakdown of yesterday's trade figures will not be available for
at least a week, most economists and bankers were cautious about the
significance of one month's results. Commerzbank, for example, saw no
justification yet for revising its in-house forecast that the national trade
surplus would climb to DM15bn in the last quarter.
March's DM4.9bn surplus, a huge advance on the DM2.8bn recorded a year
earlier, was more than double most forecasts and the second highest figure
for unified Germany. The east, struggling to recover from restructuring,
accounts for less than 3 per cent of all-German exports.
The deficit on the current account, a wider trade measure including services
and some foreign transfers, shrank sharply to DM300m, compared with DM1.9bn
in February and DM6.4bn in March last year.

<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FRANCE'S government plans a slight relaxation of its policy of fiscal rigour
next year, but still intends to keep the budget deficit below 2 per cent of
gross domestic product.
In a circular to spending ministries, Mr Pierre Beregovoy, prime minister,
has ordered that total volume of budgetary expenditure may rise only 3.5 per
cent. This compares with a forecast rate of inflation of 2.8 per cent, and a
5.5 per cent expected nominal rise in gross domestic product.
The increase in spending and the continued sluggishness in tax receipts, as
a result of the recession, mean that next year's budget deficit is likely to
rise to around FFr150bn (Pounds 15.13bn), against FFr135bn this year.
This increased deficit would nevertheless be less than 2 per cent of GDP,
which the government regards as a politically critical ceiling. By setting
this new maximum, it intends to show that France is fully able to meet the
conditions for participation in European monetary union, which include a
budgetary deficit ceiling of no more than 3 per cent of GDP.
France's budget deficit has risen each year since it bottomed out in 1990 at
FFr93bn and 1.44 per cent of GDP. This year's deficit will be 1.9 per cent
of GDP, while next year's new target will be more than 1.9 but less than 2
per cent.
Spending priorities in next year's budget will be job creation and
employment, and education. Apart from the education, justice and police, the
government intends to reduce employment in government service.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A DISPUTE between Israel and the European Community yesterday over the EC's
role in Middle East peace negotiations cast a shadow over annual talks
between the two sides as well as the latest multilateral stage of the
regional peace process.
Israel objects to full EC participation in the talks on disarmament. It is
also boycotting two of the five multilateral Middle East discussions  - on
refugees and economic co-operation - because Palestinians from outside the
occupied territories were invited,
'I hope this is not a crisis. I hope this is only tension,' said Mr David
Levy, Israel's foreign minister, on his way to the meeting in Brussels. He
said he would clarify Israel's position, but offered no concession beyond a
low-level Community presence at the seminar convened in Washington to launch
the disarmament talks.
Israel's defence establishment, backed by Mr Yitzhak Shamir, the prime
minister, has strongly resisted an EC presence at the talks, arguing that
the Europeans tend to be pro-Arab and would seek rights to inspect Israel's
secretive nuclear programme. The EC has demanded a status equivalent to that
of the US and Russia, co-sponsors of the peace talks, because of its
geographic proximity to the Middle East. Talks on the issue with the EC in
Tel Aviv last month were said to have deteriorated into angry exchanges.
The row is the latest in a series of political disputes which have dogged
Israel's relationship with the Community in recent years. Israel wants to
extend economic ties with the EC, its biggest trading partner, beyond the
terms of a 1975 free trade agreement. It is seeking the same integration
into the European Economic Area as extended to the European Free Trade
Association countries.
Mr Levy thought he had won such a commitment in return for allowing the
Community to participate in last October's Middle East peace conference in
Madrid. But a succession of statements by EC ministers and officials have
made it clear that consideration of such a move depends on substantive
Israeli concessions in the peace process, if not on an actual peace
settlement.
EC officials say one problem is that several Arab countries also want closer
integration with the Community and would object to concessions to Israel.
Dealing with all on a pan-Mediterranean basis is impossible until peace is
established.
Israel and Brussels have made progress, however, on a dispute about
appointing an EC representative in the occupied territories whose main task
is to administer direct Community aid to the Palestinians - worth about
Ecu70m (Pounds 49m) over the past year. Israel has blocked establishment of
an EC office there, but will give the representative diplomatic status. The
EC says it is insisting that its disbursement of aid should not be subject
to any Israeli control.

FT  12 MAY 92 / Survey of Business in the Community (7): Stimulus for pupils
and teachers - Schools and colleges are a prime field for involvement
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE Mary Rose is not the first thing one associates with engineering. But
for Roy Hedges, a consulting structural engineer who worked on the Mary Rose
project, describing the recovery of Henry VIII's flagship to fourth formers
at Bullers Wood School for Girls in Chislehurst, Kent, was among the most
rewarding events in his first year as one of the school's 'neighbourhood
engineers'.
'The strongest bias against technology comes from the parents', says Mr
Hedges, partner in a Bromley firm of structural engineers and one of 6,000
neighbourhood engineers attached to 1,600 secondary schools across the
country. 'Yougsters have a better idea of what engineering is about than
their parents - who see it as dirty hands and overalls. Our job is to break
the stereotypes.'
To help do so, Mr Hedges has arranged work experience schemes in his company
for several pupils, and is a frequent visitor to the school - talking, for
instance, to third years about to make GCSE option choices. It is much
appreciated by the school: 'for 10 years we have encouraged girls to take
maths and science seriously', says Mrs Barbara Vanderstock, the head
teacher.
The neighbourhood engineers scheme, run by the Engineering Council*, is just
one of many activities supported by Business in the Community** in its quest
to get business to play a more active role on the education scene.
'Education is number one item on the agenda of many member companies,' says
Ian Pearce, BIC's education director. 'We are keen to move business on from
sponsorship to people power - commiting expertise to schools and colleges,
actually getting employees to help with curriculum projects or to act as
governors, management consultants and mentors. BIC has set up a 'leadership
team' under Michael Heron, Unilever's personnel director, to provide vision
and national focus on what business can do with educators to increase
opportunities for all young people.
Working through Britain's 150 Education Business Partnerships (EBPs) -
comprising local representatives of business, local education authorities,
schools and colleges - BIC sees its main task as raising the level of
corporate activity in schools and colleges.
It could hardly start from a lower base. Only one in 10companies currently
engages in educational partnership worth the name - and often that is pure
tokenism. BIC wants company top brass to consider what they could do - and
ought to be doing - under headings like these.
Compacts. Compacts are bargains between young people, employers and
schools/colleges, by which employers agree to give training or employment
priority to young people who meet targets for attendance, punctuality, exam
results and so on. Compact centres - 62 of them in inner cities nationwide,
attached to local BEPs and Training and Enterprise Councils - act as
contacts and matchmakers.
Ken Young, deputy chairman of the Post Office, sees compacts as 'one of our
best investments of time and talent into community projects - showing
benefits for employers and school leavers alike.'
Teacher placements in industry. Since 1977 a teacher placement service, now
sponsored jointly by the CBI and the employment department, has organised
short stints in companies for teachers and education administrators.
The scheme is well-organised and expanding, with 141 placement organisers
setting up links between schools and businesses across the country. Nearly
30,000 teachers did placements last year, most of them lasting about a week.
'I have come away from this week with so many ideas as a result of my time
with London Buses', says Pam Riley of Blackfen School for Girls in the TPS
blurb, 'that I and another teacher on placement are producing a schools
maths workshop pack based on London buses'.
The teacher placement office in Oxford*** has details - and is on the
lookout for sponsors. Placements are well supported by briefing, with
special study and video packs for those embarking on them. 'It is a very
individual service', says Jan Hussey, TPR's information officer. 'The main
problem area is modern languages, where it is hard to find companies with a
relevant department'. The aim is to give 10 per cent of teachers direct
business experience each year leading to long term development in teaching
and the management of schools.'
Secondments. BEPs need full-time staff, and company secondees are the ideal
recruits. At present some 40 companies secondees - from Barclays Bank to the
Royal Mail - have staff on secondment: far more are needed to work with
education institutions and help develop quality activities with local
industries.
Alan Hodges of Marks &amp; Spencer spent two years as co-director of
Mid-Glamorgan EBP learning much about local education and corporate
responsibility before promotion to run the Swindon.
School governors. Britain's 25,000 schools need from eight to 18 governors
apiece - and more than half of them, under recent legislation, must be
either parents or co-optees with relevant experience. John Patten, the new
education secretary, recently launched a 'schools need governors' campaign,
urging employers to give employees time off with no loss of pay to become
governors.
'Employers cannot complain at the output of schools if they do not offer
their employees the opportunity to become governors,' he told an assembled
crowd of business and education leaders.
Curriculum enhancement. Companies provide resources, access to plant and
volunteer employees to work with teachers on new courses and with pupils as
mentors. Esso has helped with the School Curriculum Industry partnership to
work with primary schools and publish guidance on 'Industry and the
Curriculum 5-14.'
Quality work experience. Every young person needs access to challenging work
roles to help understand about industry, the world of work and career
opportunities. Rover gives annual awards to the best school programmes.
It is often supposed that teachers and parents alone make schools tick. But
business can make learning more realistic, exciting and relevant to
youngsters. Britain's top five per cent of pupils lead the world, but the
others are less competitive. If Britain is to recruit and train staff to
operate new technologies of modern business, a lot more than one in 10
companies will have to play a part in education.

help - A check list of useful contacts

REQUEST the considered opinion of five economists, it is said, and you will
get at least five answers. Think of any one community issue in which
business might want to become involved and, by the same token, you will get
at least a dozen organisations soliciting for help.
If the 1980s saw the dawn of corporate responsibility, the 1990s may well
see something of its shake-out. The number of organisations and initiatives
in every conceivable field has swelled demand beyond belief.
At the same time, the supply of potential sponsors has been growing. 'In the
past, company policy was largely determined by ad hoc charitable links,'
says Mr Adrian Hodges, director of communications for Business in the
Community. 'Now more and more companies are recognising the business case
for involvement.'
Companies are trying to improve the quality of their involvement in the
community and manage it like any other part of their business, he argues.
Equally, the nature of corporate decision-making has changed. Companies have
been switching over the last two decades to far greater employee
participation in how corporate resources should be invested in the
community, away from the so-called 'chairman's wife syndrome'.
All these pressures of increased selectivity, swelling demand and burgeoning
supply have generated the need for assistance through the maze. The wide
range of choices now presenting themselves to companies is bewildering and
even intimidating.
It may also be off-putting, as busy decision-makers seek a simple way to
invest their energies without wading through enormous documents to decide on
the most worthy cause.
'Companies often quote the difficulty in knowing where to go, and who the
right organisations to work with are,' says Hodges. 'Duplication of effort
is something which concerns them. We try to help identify their business
needs, and signpost them in the right direction.'
He says the organisation prides itself on 'the two telephone test'.
Companies interested in any issue should be able to make no more than two
phone calls - the first to BIC - in order to gather information or reach the
organisation they want to support.
While there may be dangers of turning to a single organisation for help, BIC
does have one clear advantage: its 'signposting' advice comes free of
charge. 'We're here to help encourage community involvement,' says Hodges.
None the less, he points out that BIC does need subscriptions to survive,
which it derives from subscribing companies, of which there are currently
about 500. For these members, it will help develop community involvement
programmes in much greater detail.
For those companies which want a second opinion even on which organisation
should receive their first phone call, other options are available. They may
have to do some research, but there are a number of private consultancy
organisations and other non-profit groups which can help.
Two of the best sources for news about organisations, issues and general
developments in corporate community involvement are the monthly publication

FT  12 MAY 92 / Survey of Business in the Community (6): Years of challenge
 -What the property developers did
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AT the start of the 1980s, Mr Michael Heseltine, then environment secretary,
invited the property industry to take part in 'the great experiment of
rebuilding new towns in old cities'.
A decade later, after some striking successes and equally notable failures,
the experiment continues in a substantially modified form.
The enterprise zones and urban development corporations that were set up in
the 1980s, will, with the occasional exception, give way to a new set of
initiatives reflecting the lessons of the last decade. 'We need to learn
from the 1980s,' says Mr Victor Hausner, whose London-based consultancy is
advising the government on urban renewal.
The 1980s vision of urban regeneration was to transform the character of
run-down areas, by harnessing the energy of the private sector. The local
authorities were largely excluded from the process, as their complex
planning regulations and sometimes hostile attitude to business were seen as
obstructive during the 1970s.
The architects of these proposals can claim that they overturned the
scepticism and inertia that dogged inner city renewal during previous
decades. Inner cities managed to attract many times as much investment from
the private sector as from public funds.
But the roles of the public and private sectors are now being reassessed.
Following the worst property recession in living memory, it will be some
years before the private sector again takes such a prominent role.
The parlous financial state of many companies has forced them to put
ambitious regeneration schemes in mothballs. Moreover, the government's
policy of stimulating an area by tax breaks without any strategic planning
in derelict areas has sometimes accentuated their problems, most notably in
the London docklands which has become something of a graveyard for
developers.
The London docklands, which has gone from boom to bust in a spectacular
fashion, is perhaps a special case. Other inner cities which always had a
greater struggle to attract investment did not become victims of their own
success and may now be less affected by the downturn. 'Recession hasn't
dented our activity; we have weathered it very well,' says Ms Fiona
Blackwell of Teesside Development Corporation.
But a broader question which concerns all the development authorities set up
by the government is whether the concept of using property development as a
way of regenerating an area is a wise one.
The government saw its mission as a matter of restoring the economic life of
areas that had been drained by depopulation and the decline of manufacturing
industry, 'The concept was to take a run-down area and transform its
character so that it attracted people in where previously it had encouraged
people out,' said Mr Heseltine.
But the government's critics argue that it put too much emphasis on physical
regeneration and too little on helping the communities who live in inner
cities. 'It is a fundamentally flawed approach,' says Mr Bob Colenutt of the
Docklands Consultative Committee which is about to publish a report on urban
policy in the 1990s.
'The whole policy seems to be based on focusing public money on property-led
flagship schemes, set against a background when public services like public
transport and social housing are getting worse.'
Mr Hausner, the department's adviser, recognises this criticism. He
distinguishes between two aspects of urban policy: that concerning
disadvantaged communities, such as training and education, and that
concerning mainstream private sector regeneration. 'Those elements have to
be linked more closely,' he says.
Mr Hausner believes that the government is addressing this issue in its City
Challenge scheme in which local authorities, acting with private developers,
compete for extra funds from the government.
This demonstrates, he says, that the government is no longer turning its
back on the local authorities, whose input is central to the City Challenge.
Moreover, the local authorities are taking an active approach to
implementing their policy, often by recruiting executives to take care of
their programmes. This is a step towards overcoming one of failings of the
1980s, which was weak implementation of policy, he says.
The City Challenge proposals have been criticised as a 'game show' by the
Labour party, which is concerned that it merely slices cash off existing
urban and housing schemes and involves no new funds.
Other critics such as Mr Nigel Smith of Drivers Jonas, chartered surveyor,
thinks that some of the proposals may be impractical as they lack sufficient
property expertise.
But the City Challenge scheme has probably been successful in laying the
groundwork for a more successful partnership between the local authorities
and the private sector than has been seen for two decades. According to Mr
Ted Watts, president of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, 'local
authorities have taken on board the need not to take on everything
themselves but to involve the private sector'.
Beyond the City Challenge proposals, government policy on urban regeneration
is not yet wholly defined. The new urban regeneration agency, the more
interventionist philosophy of the Department of Trade and Industry and the
increasing attention paid by the EC to urban centres will all shape policy
during the 1990s.
The private sector, now taking a largely back seat role, will play an
increasing part as the property sector comes out of recession. Mr Nigel
Smith of Drivers Jonas reports that in some parts of the country developers
are still active, although in the commercial sector pre-lets and pre-sales
are essential.
He thinks there are grounds for optimism about the partnership between the
public and private sector. Developers will be encouraged by the government's
greater willingness to put money into infrastructure, to do more planning
and to release land in more manageable lot sizes. 'There is more realism,'
he says.
Mr Hausner agrees that the more realistic approach adopted by the public
sector augurs well for private sector developers. 'The situation is one of
great potential if we learn lessons from the 1980s,' he says. 'There is a
lot to play for.'

FT  12 MAY 92 / Survey of Business in the Community (4): Benefits that work
both ways / Discovering the spin-offs of seconding staff to local projects
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

ALISON KETTERING has no regrets about the 100 hours during which she was
seconded part-time from the Nationwide Anglia building society to Islington
Voluntary Action Council. She has since been promoted from management
trainee to branch manager at Rayners Lane in London.
Her attachment over three months for a day each week provided a local
community group with an analysis of how to improve its services. It also
gave her - and indirectly her employer - the benefits of invaluable training
in interviewing and report-writing, time management and a wholly different
perspective on life and work.
The role of secondment in the community has shifted sharply in the last few
years. The image of companies handing over begrudging burnt-out executives
to voluntary organisations as an act of charity has all but disappeared. In
its place have come the best up-and-coming staff on loan for sound
commercial reasons.
The idea of loaning employees to an outside organisation - while normally
keeping them on full salary and benefits - has been around for a long time.
But its adoption is growing fast, and the reasons for doing so are more
diverse and powerful than ever.
A survey in 1989 estimated that there were 890 secondees from the private
sector and 150 from government departments during the year, representing
staffing costs of about Pounds 20m. The trend has continued.
Nowhere is the pattern more clearly visible than at the Action Resource
Centre, an organisation based in London and with offices around the country,
which specialises in 'brokering' secondments by establishing links between
companies and voluntary organisations.
ARC's annual report, released at the start of this month,shows that it alone
coordinated 425 secondments in the 12 months to the end of March. Mr David
Hemsworth, director of communications, says: 'The proof of the pudding is in
the figures.'
Companies are sufficiently keen that they willingly pay the Pounds
500-Pounds 1,000 fee charged by ARC for each secondee placed. In fact, Mr
Hemsworth says he now finds much of his marketing efforts target voluntary
organisations, to ensure that he can generate sufficient quality placements
each year to meet demand from businesses.
Marks &amp; Spencer alone used ARC to arrange 62 secondments this year.
Meanwhile, Alison Kettering at Nationwide Anglia found herself competing
against an enthusiastic glut of trainees who were trying to be allowed to
take part.
ARC is not alone in arranging secondments. Accountancy firms are just one
sector which has long seconded staff to public sector bodies such as the
Stock Exchange and the Serious Fraud Office. The trade-off includes greater
insight into the operation of government, training for those attached and
potential business leads, and as well as altruism.
But even where attachments to the voluntary sector are concerned and the
pay-back is rather more personal, large numbers of secondees have been
attracted from unsolicited applications from voluntary organisations to
companies.
Some - particularly those sought to work in the network of local enterprise
agencies around the country - are handled through Business in the Community.
A vast number of shorter attachments - for one or two weeks - are arranged
by Understanding British Industry, which specialises in placing school
teachers into industry for a limited period.
'Secondment has come a long way over the last two years,' says Mr Hemsworth.
'The stereotype was of a tired executive being put out to grass before
retirement. Like all stereotypes it had some truth to it. But the more
accurate image now is of the early or mid-career manager using a short
placement as way of development.'
Traditionally, he says, requests for secondees were dealt with by companies'
community affairs departments. Attachments were typically for full-time for
two years or more, often with unclear objectives.
That sector remains important. But its growth has all but tailed off. In its
place has come a range of shorter-term, often part-time attachments for
bright young talent, normally arranged by the personnel or training
department. In the time alloted, they may computerise the accounts, develop
a marketing plan, or produce a feasibility study.
'They are taken out of the womb of their company and put in a different
organisation in scale and ethos,' says Mr Hemsworth. 'They develop qualities
of adaptability and hone soft management skills like negotiation, influence
and communications.'
Even in 1989, 41 per cent of companies offering secondments said they were
designed for employees in mid-career. That proportion has grown sharply
since, driven by the realisation that it provides clear returns to the
company. Short secondments are proving valuable for both general training
and to prepare staff for a transition to a different job within their
company.
As Heather Hubbard, training and development adviser at Marks &amp; Spencer,
puts it: 'Secondment provides an opportunity to make not only a contribution
to the community but also for personal development of staff. We think it's a
very powerful method of developing management skills.'
Voluntary organisations also benefit greatly. They are likely to get more
energetic staff with a highly-focused project than through more traditional
secondment programmes.
Mr Hemsworth stresses a number of important points that should be respected
if the secondment is to work effectively. Companies need to recognise the
importance of the idea from the board-level downwards.
Secondees must be genuinely committed to their attachments, and so should be
fully prepared in advance and given a choice of possible assignments. They
should also stay in regular touch with their employer.
And voluntary organisations must accept fully management responsibility for
their secondees, helping them integrate and devising a project which
provides lasting benefit rather than a spare pair of hands.

SUPPORT for enterprise and, more specifically, backing for small businesses
have become essential elements of the community involvement programmes of
many large companies over the past decade.
Enterprise support has not escaped the rigorous reappraisal which big
business has given to its charitable giving but there are no signs that
large companies are making any fundamental shift away from this area of
activity.
The recession has undoubtedly put pressure on community support budgets but
it has also emphasised the importance of backing local, small scale economic
activity if the large businesses themselves are to prosper. At the same time
enterprise support, which emerged as a legitimate part of community
involvement in the late 1970s and early 1980s, is increasingly obliged to
fight for its share of companies' community budgets alongside education and
the environment.
For many companies education and enterprise are closely linked themes. They
frequently seek to inject an element of enterprise into the formal education
system which, in the view of many observers, has been hostile to the
business ethic. At the same time fostering enterprise or self-reliance was
seen as being of benefit to the pupil regardless of whether he or she was
destined for self-employment or employment.
Enterprise support has traditionally taken a number of forms:
Seconding staff to help organisations such as the enterprise agencies advise
entrepreneurs setting up in business. This process also benefited the staff
who gained a broader experience.
Providing funds to support advice organisations and run training programmes.
Turning over redundant factory or office space to provide workshops for
small businesses. The donor would often subsidise or provide centralised
facilities such as a switchboard, receptionist and security.
Providing finance for small venture capital and loan funds.
Shell UK, for one, is maintaining its Pounds lm-a-year commitment to its two
main enterprise programmes aimed at young people, says Mr Asif Abdulla,
enterprise manager. Its Livewire programme provides advice and awards in
cash and 'kind' to 16-25 year olds who submit an acceptable business plan
while the Shell Technology Enterprise Programme (STEP) places 400
polytechnic and university students with small businesses during-their
summer vacation.
Shell is continuing its backing for start-ups at a time when much of the
emphasis of small firms support is switching to the more established, though
still small, business. This shift has been prompted by the realisation that
established companies have already survived the most difficult early days
and are more likely to create jobs in the short term than start- ups.
But Shell remains convinced of the need, and the value to its public image,
of backing young people with business ideas. As part of the more pragmatic
approach that businesses have been taking to their community programmes in
recent years Shell has been keen to obtain 'leverage' for its own investment
in enterprise programmes by bringing in co-sponsors.
British Steel (Industry) and British Coal Enterprise helped sponsor the 1991
STEP programme. Every Pounds 1 that Shell puts into STEP generates a total
investment of Pounds 8, says Mr Abdulla. The Prince's Youth Business Trust
(PYBT), which helps young entrepreneurs, has noticed a far more commercial
approach by sponsors.
In the past many sponsors provided money from their charitable funds with no
strings attached and with little expectation of any acknowledgment of their
contribution. But increasingly, the PYBT reports, companies have begun
backing enterprise from their marketing budgets. This means organisations
seeking corporate backing must be aware of their sponsors' marketing needs
and be willing to accept more overt promotional links.
The PYBT's most recent fund-raising, to mark the Prince of Wales's 40th
birthday, sought deliberately to raise money from small and medium-sized
businesses to compensate for cut-backs among its traditional blue-chip
sponsors. The most recent instance of a large company recasting its
community involvement policy came with the announcement last month by
National Westminster Bank that community activities would reflect its
business priorities more closely.
The bank gave Pounds 13.7m to community support last year. NatWest said it
had adopted the promotion of a more financially informed society and the
encouragement of enterprise skills as its central objective. Previously the
bank had tended to support good ideas rather than focus on aims.
By focusing on activities it understands best the bank hopes to make greater
use of staff skills as well as providing money for the causes it backs. The
NatWest approach is expected to be adopted more widely by large companies.
BP, the petroleum company, has also focused its community activities more
closely - it has recently devoted considerable effort to backing innovation
 -while BAT Industries, the tobacco and financial services group, is
concentrating on a smaller number of big projects.
Large companies are increasingly likely to draw up formal policy statements
for their community involvement. These frequently reveal a broad spread of
activities. British Gas, for example, lists six main categories under its
'social policy.' These cover education, the environment, the arts, sport,
charitable support and community projects. This last category includes
backing enterprise and developing small businesses, particularly among the
economically and socially disadvantaged.
As part of enterprise support British Gas backs Young Enterprise, a project
which helps 15-19 year olds set up and run businesses. It is also helping
set up the Felix Road Enterprise Centre in Bristol to provide 21,000 sq. ft
of light industrial space, offices and studio workshops.
This is part of a policy intended to reach many audiences: customers and
their communities, employees, shareholders, the business community and local
and national government. 'More than ever we must speak to these audiences
directly by achieving a positive public profile from the projects we
support,' the company says.
BAT Industries' community involvement programme in the UK has two main
goals, the company says. These are 'to provide support to small businesses
and to enable young people to receive high quality, productive education.'
The reason for this involvement is because it 'believes that no successful
company can exist in isolation from the community in which it does
business'.
BAT has concentrated its efforts on backing enterprise agencies in
Southampton and South London and on financing the creation of business
centres providing accommodation for small companies in Liverpool and
Brixton. The approach of big business to community involvement is becoming
more tightly focused within a broader range of overall objectives. There are
no signs, though, that large companies are any less committed to community
programmes in general or to the theme of enterprise in particular.

A YEAR ago Doncaster Enterprise Agency was rather suspicious about the new
Barnsley and Doncaster Training and Enterprise Council.
Mr Brian Crangle, chief executive of the agency, one of the 300-odd
enterprise agencies in the UK which come under the umbrella of Business in
the Community, says: 'It was not clear whether the Tec was going to be a
catalyst or a provider of services itself.
'But as our relationship has progressed we have come to a much better
understanding of what the Tec is all about and the positive role that it can
play in co-ordinating our activities.'
Resolution of the role of Tecs in stimulating and supporting enterprise
activities, in what is an already crowded playing field, has been one of the
critical issues for the movement.
Tecs have been set up over the past two years by Mr Michael Howard, the
former Employment secretary. Employer-led they drew their original
inspiration from the Private Enterprise Councils in the US.
With a majority of private sector employers on their boards, Tecs were
intended to bring a sharp new local focus to both training and enterprise
activities in England and Wales.
Part of their enterprise brief has been to promote the growth of small
companies and to bring greater coherence to the many strands of help
available and to ensure that any gaps in services were filled with
cost-effective provision.
Tecs' brief included the development of business information and advice
services; the enterprise allowance scheme; training provision for small
businesses and support for exporters.
The agenda has not been without problems, not least because the Department
of Employment and the Department of Trade and Industry have not themselves
closely co-ordinated their activities in the field of enterprise.
At the sharp end, Tecs have come into conflict with existing providers of
business assistance - including chambers of commerce and enterprise
agencies.
Chambers, like enterprise agencies, are largely supported by voluntary
subscription and offer a wide range of services to their members including
business advice.
The most notable conflicts between chambers and Tecs, for example, have been
when Tecs have set up rival services to those of chambers, such as export
advice, and where they have set up membership subscriptions from the same
client base.
At best, however, a growing number of the 82 Tecs are either working in
partnership with chambers of commerce and enterprise agencies, contracting
with them to provide services including business information advice, or else
they are providing leadership in co-ordinating activities.
County Durham Tec, for example, has created a network of eight 'Business
Services Centres' in partnership with existing bodies providing a single
point of entry for the entire range of enterprise support services.
The Tec has based the centres on existing Enterprise Agencies and
Development Agencies.
Birmingham Tec, in partnership with other agencies including enterprise
agencies, is bringing together all enterprise initiatives to provide new and
developing businesses with continuity and consistency of support.
The New Business Programme provides an integrated package including improved
access to business counselling and advice, preparatory training and support
funding.
Doncaster Enterprise Agency, for example, has a contract from Barnsley and
Doncaster Tec to operate its enterprise allowance scheme, which is a scheme
which offers unemployed people financial help to start their own businesses.
Whether partnership will one day lead to marriage, with Tecs eventually
absorbing some of the other players, remains to be seen.
Brian Crangle is probably typical of most Enterprise Agency activists when
he says he could not envisage his agency being absorbed by the Tec although
he sees closer and closer partnership arrangements.
'I believe in a federal approach,' he says.
So what has the Tec brought to the party? Mr Crangle says that the fact that
the Tec had money to spend was an important attraction in bringing people
together.
'The fact that it has money to spend probably persuaded different people to
sit down at the same table in the first place,' he says.
He also believes that the boards of Tecs themselves, drawn from a localised
business community along with representatives of public sector organisations
such as local councils, are an important forum for the exchange of ideas.
According to a recent survey, contacts between small businesses and large
local companies and public sector organisations are not particularly strong.
The survey, by Kingston Polytechnic for Midland Bank, said most small
businesses were not as well integrated into strong local networks of
contacts as many people generally assumed.
Tecs, it is hoped by the government, should bring a new spirit of
co-operation and understanding into local business networks.
But a lot more will have to be done to raise the general performance to the
standards reached by the best.

FT  12 MAY 92 / Survey of Business in the Community (2): Challenge of the
hard core areas - Pump priming in North East England and the Midlands
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

THE MURDER of a hostel dweller drinking in a pub in a rough area of
Newcastle upon Tyne is not the sort of incident in which one would expect
leading businessmen to take a personal interest.
But when a man was stabbed to death last month at The Chieftain, in
Newcastle's Cruddas Park area, Barclays bank north east England regional
director Mr John Ward immediately thought 'Oh no, not my patch'.
It was not that Cruddas Park teems with Barclays customers; indeed, it is
doubtful whether many of its residents have a cheque book, far less savings
or investments.
Mr Ward's response was because this deprived inner city area of high rise
flats and post-war terraces, centred on a bleak concrete shopping centre of
which The Chieftain is part, has been the focus of one of the most ambitious
projects undertaken by any of the Business Leadership Teams fostered by
Business in the Community.
Nobody, even before the murder, was claiming Cruddas Park had been totally
transformed since it was identified in late 1988 by The Newcastle
Initiative, the city's Business Leadership Team, as a testbed for how TNI's
skills, contacts and resources could be focused on regenerating an area
brought low by high unemployment and social problems.
The stabbing served as a reminder that a web of social and economic
difficulties woven over decades cannot be unravelled by a couple of years of
private sector intervention.
But TNI's experiment, in which it has been supported by central government
departments, Labour-controlled Newcastle City Council and some local
residents, has made Cruddas Park a less threatening place to live in and,
through tackling residents' employment problems - and some employers'
prejudice - transformed some people's lives.
It has also wrought a small transformation by making prominent Tyneside
businesspeople feel that what happens in Cruddas Park affects them; for
years such areas have been almost totally bypassed by the affluent, none of
whom would dream of living there.
TNI was one of the first Business Leadership Teams set up in the wake of the
Calderdale Partnership, created in 1987 by Business in the Community to
bring together local business leaders to tackle their area's problems.
Today, there are 16 BLTs in the UK as well a number of other more
tightly-focused bodies, not formally constituted but working on similar
lines.
The BLTs' resolute individualism in the way they interpret their role is
reflected even in their patchwork quilt of names, from the Bradford
Breakthrough to West London Leadership, Teesside Tomorrow and the Wearside
Opportunity.
But they share a common philosophy: the belief that companies' commercial
success depends largely on the economic health of their local communities
and, therefore, that those companies which improve their community's
economic health enhance their own businesses too.
The BLTs are also united in being led by the private sector, in recruiting
the businesspeople on their boards only from the most senior level and in
being dedicated to tackling, in their particular area, what they perceive as
the key problems.
Another uniting factor, which can be both a strength and a weakness, is that
BLTs do not have any function they are legally obliged to fulfil, nor any
automatic funding.
At its best this means they can use the often considerable influence of
their prominent members to promote the wellbeing of their area and also
bring fresh thinking to seemingly intractable problems.
'They act but they are not constrained,' says Mr Paul Johnson, BIC's
regional director in north east England. 'They have a very powerful lobbying
impact.'
At a time when very many companies are both short of spare money and
constantly under pressure to donate funds to myriad worthy causes, BLTs can
provide an appealingly flexible 'value added' route to community involvement
enabling companies to offer access to their services or their skilled staff
rather than cash.
Furthermore, BLTs can create a meeting point, for the good of the local
community, for busy business leaders who would otherwise not know each other
nor realise they had common cause.
At the worst, however, BLTs' non-official status means they can be accused
of seeking credit for investments and successes for which other
organisations also claim kudos.
It can also lead BLTs into a political quagmire where they find themselves
caught between those councillors and officers who welcome their input and
those who resent it; a major heritage project championed by one BLT bit the
dust when blocked, late in the day, by the 'antis'.
'I think their attitude is: why should these businessmen meddle in something
which is the council's job,' says a successful businessman on the board of
the BLT involved. 'You have to understand the mentality - it's a hostile
attitude to the nasty capitalists.'
However, the same BLT has found support from the same council for smaller
projects and strong encouragement from some other local authorities. The
successful businessman, although irked that valuable time was wasted, is
still enthusiastic about his BLT involvement.
To operate effectively BLTs need constant injections of new blood; hence
BIC's decision to hold a series of regional conferences on its Directions in
the Nineties campaign.
The first two, in Gateshead and Birmingham, take place today, addressed,
respectively, by British Telecom chairman Mr Iain Vallance and Mr Robert
Evans, chairman and chief executive of British Gas.
The conferences are the first mounted by BIC specifically to get more
companies involved in their communities. In areas such as north east
England, with few locally headquartered plcs and a burgeoning number of BLTs
(three are well established and three more in formation) the need is acute.
Both the Newcastle Initiative and Wearside Opportunity currently have chief
executives seconded from the DTI, not the private sector.
Regional BIC director Mr Johnson says that, with honourable exceptions, the
manufacturing sector has proved especially difficult to win over to BIC's
philosophy of enlightened self interest through community involvement.
'There's been a tradition of 'head down and make the widgets'', he says.
Casting its net, TNI has just hosted a highly successful environmental
breakfast, attracting 200 businesspeople. They were all given a free
factpack on the environment, including new legislation, then asked to pledge
something in return. The response has been very encouraging.
TNI's priority has been to enhance Newcastle's regional capital role through
urban regeneration, ranging from Cruddas Park to the city's architecturally
superb Grey Street and its Chinatown restaurant area.
The Wearside Opportunity's primary objective is to promote Wearside as The
Advanced Manufacturing Centre of the north: it has coined the Make It
Wearside slogan emblazoned on commercial vehicles all over the area and used
in national advertising.
Teesside Tomorrow has mainly concentrated on smaller projects across a wide
range of sectors, including areas not covered by other organisations.
One of Teesside Tomorrow's board members is Mr Alistair Arkley, chief
executive of locally based Century Inns, a fast-expanding chain of nearly
300 pubs. He voices what is probably a typical mixture of motives for
becoming involved.
Partly, he says, it was a philanthropic desire to improve the environment
and culture of the area where he is based; also a personal wish to get to
know other business leaders and discuss mutual problems. He was also aware
of the potential direct benefits to his business.
'We're reliant on the people of the community to drink in our pubs to ensure
a prosperous future for the business in the markets where we're strong,' he
says. 'If there's better employment, a better environment, that will help my
business.'
In Birmingham, where many smaller companies identify more readily with their
immediate area than the city as a whole, BIC has opted for setting up
smaller BLT-type bodies. One example is the Newtown business group,
comprising 12 companies, led by industrial tool sales, hire and repair
company WH Price Ltd, which employs 150 people.
The companies are in an inner city location suffering the familiar problems
of litter, graffiti, unemployment, lack of parking space and poor
redevelopment which has created bleak open spaces.
Mr Tim Lunt, chairman of WH Price, says the business group has brought his
company into contact for the first time with nearby businesses with similar
problems. 'It's really been a chance for us to get together. And we've had a
chance to talk to the residents of the area. They have very different
problems to us, who commute into this area.'
The Newtown group, like a number of BLTs, has been involved in its local
authority's submission of a City Challenge bid for Department of the
Environment funds to improve the area.
Some of those who become involved in BLTs do so after participating in
programmes run by Common Purpose, set up in 1989 by Julia Middleton,
formerly of the Industrial Society. Common Purpose aims to expose the next
generation of decision-makers, in the private, voluntary and public sector,
to the different aspects of their city, to create better understanding and
more effective networks.
It pitches its recruitment - each year a group of around 30 gets together
for 11 programme days - a couple of pegs down from BLT board member level.
'We're dealing with the people who in five years time are going to be at the
top,' says Jenny Talbot, its Midlands director.
Launched in 1989 in Newcastle and Coventry, Common Purpose now operates in
16 locations in England and Scotland. Like the BLTs it is locally self
financing, relying on sponsorship in cash and kind.
It too is committed to involving more companies. 'We have to make very
considerable efforts to get new companies involved,' says north east England
director Deborah Jenkins. She has contacted more than 1,000 businesses in
three years.
Miss Talbot says 'getting your foot in the door' is the most difficult part:
she fears the sheer number of organisations wanting to get companies
involved in community-related activities may have a deterrent effect.
Miss Jenkins sees Common Purpose's main contribution as raising
understanding and thinking about the problems facing cities. That includes
breaking down preconceptions in all sectors.
'In one sense, the great disease is having too many people who want to get
something done,' she says. 'Thrusting young executives can be a pain,
especially when they think they know what makes people poor. It's very
difficult for somebody successful to really understand somebody who doesn't
appear successful.'
There is, she says, a type of business thinking which believes there is no
such thing as a problem, only a challenge. 'It's an idea that if you look at
a set of circumstances in a different way, it's not a problem, it's
something terribly exciting to sort out.'
For those living in fear of crime, making do on state benefits, coping on
their own with children and resigned to unemployment, being seen as an
exciting challenge may be just one more indignity.
The success of the Cruddas Park initiative is due in large measure to the
recognition that solutions cannot be imposed on such areas. Local people
must be actively involved, if possible as leaders. This takes time and slow,
painstaking work, requiring long-term commitment and patience, qualities
often in short supply among companies primarily concerned about survival and
this year's balance sheet.
After three years' effort, the Cruddas Park initiative has so far helped 192
local people into employment and assisted residents in setting up four
businesses. Local unemployment is now estimated at around 45 per cent.
While BIC wants to get more companies involved, Mr Ward of Barclays, who has
shown strong personal commitment to TNI and to the Cruddas Park Community
Trust, both of which he chairs, is worried about how the community can also
be encouraged to participate. 'My worry is that my perception and the
business world's perception of what we are doing isn't necessarily seen by
the community,' he says. 'It needs to come from both ends to work as
effectively as it can.'
Suspicion, apathy and resignation create barriers. 'There's very warm
acknowledgment from the doers in the community; but it's the vast majority
of people on council estates who don't get involved,' says Mr Ward. But he
remains resolutely committed. 'I'm a great optimist. If I wasn't I wouldn't
do the job.'

FT  12 MAY 92 / Survey of Business in the Community (1): Partnerships that
work - Over the past 10 years many large UK companies and their employees
have entered into a wide range of activities in partnership with their local
communities.  The aim now is to encourage many more smaller businesses to
begin to participate
</HEADLINE>

AROUND 100 senior business leaders meet in Birmingham and Newcastle today to
hear how they and their companies can get involved in helping the community
and at the same time help themselves.
The meetings are part of a campaign organised by Business in the Community
to extend and deepen the participation of companies in a range of local
activities and to ensure that community involvement becomes a natural part
of successful business practice.
They coincide with the 10th anniversary of BITC, an umbrella organisation
which helps create partnerships between business, government and local
communities to improve the economic, physical and social environment.
The organisation is at something of a crossroads, and is seeking to develop
a blueprint for expanding community involvement to virtually every company
in the country, not out of a sense of charity but out of enlightened
self-interest.
Mr Neil Shaw, chairman of Tate &amp; Lyle and the current chairman of BITC,
says: 'We need to move to Stage Two of our existence by significantly
enlarging our army of volunteers ...by doing so we develop better people and
as a result better companies.'
Today's conferences, spearheaded in Birmingham by Mr Robert Evans, chairman
of British Gas, and in Newcastle by Mr Iain Vallance, chairman of BT, are
part of a series of six across the country which follow an assessment of
BITC strategy last year called Directions for the Nineties.
Since the organisation was set up a decade ago, around 500 companies have
joined and several thousand have entered into local partnerships. The
question now is how these activities can best be expanded and developed by
involving more companies and more employees, and by linking community help
with other business functions.
Corporate community involvement in the UK can trace its roots back to the
Victorian era when industrialists such as Cadbury, Rowntree and Boot
provided free education for employees. Social 'investments' were viewed as
essential to commercial success, and they remain an essential ingredient of
family-led businesses such as Marks &amp; Spencer and J. Sainsbury.
However, under the Labour post-war administration, the central government
took more responsibility for social welfare, and corporate patronage
declined. It re-emerged in the late 1970s and early 1980s with the decline
of traditional manufacturing industries and increasing levels of social
alienation, particularly among the young and ethnic minorities.
Enlightened businesses began taking direct corporate action to rebuild the
health and vitality of local communities, and companies such as IBM (UK),
BP, Shell, British Steel, Barclays and Midland banks all developed community
involvement policies.
An Anglo-American conference at Sunningdale in 1980 led to the establishment
of a working party chaired by Sir Alastair Pilkington, chosen because of the
glassmakers' pioneering work with the St Helens enterprise agency, and this
committee laid the foundations for the launch of BITC in 1982. The profile
of the organisation was raised greatly in 1985 when the Prince of Wales
became president.
It was also the riots of 1981 in Brixton, south London and Toxteth,
Liverpool that gave the movement a big fillip. Mr Michael Heseltine, then
environment secretary, dragooned a group of senior businessmen on to buses
to show the devastation of Toxteth, and this proved to be the catalyst for
much wider action.
From its launch BITC supported the local enterprise agency movement as a job
creation vehicle for redundant employees and unemployed school leavers, and
the development of employment opportunities has remained an important
priority.
The private sector's work with LEAs and other community initiatives has
drawn thousands of large, medium and small companies into community
involvement. It has also developed the practice of partnership between the
private sector, local authorities, voluntary organisations and central
government, and paved the way for the establishment of Training and
Enterprise Councils (Tecs).
BITC, acting as an umbrella organisation and a disseminator of best
practice, has evolved into a national organisation with 11 regional offices.
Target teams focus on national issues, business leadership teams implement
programmes locally, and neighbourhood economic development partnerships
address urban regeneration problems at local level.
The Per Cent Club, administered by BITC, is a group of companies which have
agreed to contribute a  1/2 per cent or more of pre-tax profits, or 1 per
cent of dividends, to community based projects. Contributions take the form
of cash, staff secondments, or donations in kind such as equipment,
premises, time or expertise. More than 500 organisations are now members of
the clubs.
A Professional Firms Group pledges professional services free of charge to
community projects, including engineering, legal, accountancy, quantity
surveying and architectural services.
In the early years, help from business was concentrated on straight
charitable giving and sponsorship of the arts and sport. These are still
important but they now form a much smaller part of the total.
The issues facing the movement have become much more focused since
Directions for the Nineties was published after a lengthy consultation
exercise. They are the need to widen the range of support given by business
to the community, the need to include more employees in community
involvement, and the need to integrate community work fully into every
aspect of corporate life.
Mr Shaw, like other BITC leaders, stresses that a company's involvement in
the community must not be seen as just a charitable act, but as a 'two-way
street' that benefits the company as much as the community by generating a
more prosperous local economy.
He also emphasises the benefits to the individual of community work. 'I
would pay more attention to a successful involvement in a local project than
I would to success at business school,' he says.
Sir Allen Shepherd, chairman and group chief executive of Grand Metropolitan
and a deputy chairman of BITC, says: 'Corporate responsibility is not a
fringe activity. It is becoming an integral part of doing business.'
The GrandMet Trust has become the largest private agency in the country for
providing government-sponsored training and counselling programmes for the
unemployed. On any given day, 5,000 people will be attending a course, and
80 per cent of those completing one go on to find full-time employment.
The secondment of employees, favoured particularly by companies such as
Marks &amp; Spencer which donates Pounds 5.5m a year to community work, IBM,
banks and the big accountancy firms, has always been an effective link with
local communities.
The enterprise agency or local organisation gains from the secondee's
expertise and fresh approach to problems, and the company sees key employees
increase the range of their experience.
Kingfisher, which owns B &amp; Q, Comet and Woolworths, was a founder member of
the Opportunity 2000 campaign aimed at increasing the quality and quantity
of women's participation in the workforce, and the company has sponsored a
guide to corporate responsibility.
WH Smith is one of many companies that has encouraged employee participation
by matching pound for pound any sums raised. One recent exercise has been to
update the Samaritans' overloaded crisis phone lines.
Mr Sam Whitbread, chairman of Whitbread the brewers and chairman of BITC's
target team on employee volunteering, believes this area is the key to a
company benefiting from community activities. 'It can be used as a vehicle
for team building and staff development, it fosters positive communication
with otherwise disparate departments and generates a caring, service-driven
culture which can only lead to a commercial advantage,' he says.
The recession of the last 18 months has clearly had an impact on the
community involvement of some businesses. Redundancies and closures do not
sit happily alongside well publicised community projects. But the effect has
not been as great as might have been expected.
Mrs Julia Cleverdon, BITC chief executive, believes that support has been
well maintained partly because of the interest of chairmen and chief
executives who insist on a commitment being kept. It is also partly because
of a growing appreciation that the backing and sympathy of the local
community is particularly valuable to a company in difficult times.
What seems to have happened in recent years is that an increasing number of
large companies have appreciated the benefits of community involvement. But
this has not filtered down sufficiently to smaller companies, who wonder
whether they have the resources to act effectively enough.
What stops many business leaders from becoming involved in the community is
not unwillingness, but a lack of knowledge of the working mechanisms through
which their energies can best be channelled.
That is the purpose of today's meetings and of others to follow.

FT  12 MAY 92 / Survey of Angola (19): Lifeline for city dwellers - Luanda's
alternative market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK BLUM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'THIS,' declared my guide with a sweep of his hand, 'is Angola's real
economy.'
The Roque Santeiro black market, spread out before us, is bustling with
activity.
It sprawls among the barren, sun-drenched hills, 15 minutes' drive from
central Luanda. For a splendid view of the city, drive along the Avenida Boa
Vista, look beyond the run-down factories and shanty dwellings and the city
is laid out before you, red-tiled suburbs, tree-lined boulevards, and the
bay itself.
But few are here for the view. Thousands of people are making their way on
foot and bicycle, or piled into battered trucks and cars. They are preparing
to buy or sell just about anything.
In downtown Luanda, most of the shopfronts have been empty for years. Faded
posters and dusty neon signs offer poignant reminders of a past Luanda. But
Roque Santeiro market is thriving.
No-one knows exactly how many people flock to the Angolan capital's largest
 -and unofficial - market. Certainly, tens of thousands, if not scores of
thousands, of people pass through every day of the week, from morning to
night-fall, to trade in anything from whisky, fruit, vegetables and
medicines to modern hi-fi equipment, tools, refrigerators, and cars.
Almost everything is on sale in Roque Santeiro, but at a price - and not
without risks to the unwary; beware of muggers and pickpockets.
It is both a source of goods unavailable elsewhere and a lifeline for many
of the city's estimated 2m inhabitants: a place where local people can
supplement subsistence incomes by selling bartered goods, their own small
manufactures and market-gardening produce, or even products bought in
official stores or directly from state factories.
A large quantity of stolen goods also finds its way onto the market. It is
usually off-limits to the police, but occasionally - heavily armed - they
will look in to search for stolen property.
Roque Santeiro is unique in Angola because of its vast size. There are
several similar but smaller markets in other towns. They are tolerated
because they are an essential part of an economy that has been devastated by
16 years of civil war.
Goods on sale are not cheap by local standards. A pair of Portuguese shoes
can cost Kz55,000, although with some bargaining the price may be brought
down to Kz45,000. But this represents a small fortune for most Angolans -
the average monthly salary is Kz25,000-Kz30,000.
A refrigerator may sell for between Kz700,000 and Kz1.4m, roughly the same
price as in one of the supermarkets in town. But whisky at about Kz10,000
was Kz3,000 cheaper: for a shopper using the parallel exchange rate of
Kz1,500 to the US dollar, it was a bargain.
Like a gigantic bee-hive, the market appears chaotic on the surface but a
closer look shows that it has evolved with sections for food, clothing,
shoes, electrical and other goods.
Small makeshift stalls are erected each day from discarded wood panels,
boxes or tin drums, with shelter provided from a piece of cloth hung over a
few sticks. Some traders dispense with stalls altogether and stand next to
piles of boxes of canned beer and soft drinks - almost certainly brought
straight to the market from the port where duty probably went unpaid, and
where the lawful owner of the goods will be making fruitless inquiries.
Hairdressers clip away in the open air and small boys dart in and out the
crowd, selling watches, cigarettes or trinkets. A few tough-looking young
men stand around with wads of banknotes in their hands, waiting to swap
currencies.
The authorities seem happy to turn a blind eye to the transactions. Raiding
the market would be unpopular and ineffective, simply driving traders
underground or to other parts of the city.
Roque Santeiro and other markets of its kind operate and survive in a
no-man's-land of individual initiative and private enterprise that was never
stifled during the years when the state dominated the economy. Now the
markets are more popular than ever.

FT  12 MAY 92 / Survey of Angola (18): Guide for business visitors
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE spectacular sight of Luanda bay, overlooked by a majestic Portuguese
fort, blue sea lapping against the palm tree-lined marginale, ill-prepares
the visitor about to land at a squalid airport, serving a decrepit city,
surrounded by wretched shanty towns.
But it need not be nearly as bad as it might at first seem. The heavy hand
of an authoritarian government bureaucracy has been lifted. It is now a
friendly bureaucracy.
The once-elegant city is trying to pick itself up. Rubbish is being
collected, several buildings are being renovated, bars and restaurants are
reopening and if you have left anything behind, you can probably find it at
the sprawling market known as the Roque Santeiro - but only go with an
experienced guide.
If you expect a taxi to be at the airport, you should have read this guide
before leaving home.
A handful of battered vehicles still ply the city streets but they're not
usually to be found at the airport.
Arrange to be met.
The airport (Aeroporto 4 de Fevereiro) is about 4km from the city centre.
There are no public telephones or banking services.
If you are fortunate, you have a booking at the Presidente Meridien or the
Tivoli, where you can be almost certain that there will always be water and
power. Such is the demand, that even a booking does not always guarantee a
room.
Wherever you plan to stay, book well ahead; business is picking up.
One of the first things to do on arrival is to make plans to leave, ie
confirm your return booking.
Changing your travel plans can be a tedious business: the national airline
TAAG has a monopoly on ticket sales (excluding TAP flights). If you wish to
fly to Addis Ababa, for example, go first to TAAG who will issue an order
for the ticket. This must be presented at the bank for payment in foreign
exchange.
Then return to TAAG with the voucher and collect your ticket.
Check in at least two hours before departure.
Health precautions: yellow fever, cholera vaccination certificates are
required; malaria prophylactics essential; drink only bottled water.
No limit on cash or travellers cheques that may be taken in but if you
expect to take back more than Dollars 5,000, a bank declaration must be
completed for presentation at the airport. It is forbidden to export the
local currency.
Credit cards: American Express accepted at Presidente and Tivoli Hotels.
Night spots: Espaco 93 for jazz or the discos Paralelo 2000 and Pandemonium.
Excursions: Seek local advice, whether planning a local journey or going
further afield - the security situation can change rapidly. Luanda itself
can be dangerous.
It is no longer necessary to carry a document authorising you to leave the
city (Guia de Marcha) but take local advice about your route before
travelling out of Luanda. One hour's drive south on the coast road gets you
to the Cuanza River bridge (where Cuban foxholes are a melancholy reminder
of the war); continue and the road will take you to Porto Amboim or drive
north to Ambriz.
Internal air travel: TAAG, the local airline, serves domestic routes but can
be unreliable.
DOING BUSINESS
An experienced resident managing director of a foreign company offered this
list of do's and don'ts:
DON'T Forget that skills are at a premium: it is difficult to find a good
secretary, let alone an office manager;
Be discouraged by initial failures;
Be put off by your first visit;
Be put off by the present lack of raw materials and machines - this should
ease as access to South African sources increases;
Do business without a local partner.
DO Hire a local Mr Fix It to help you through the bureaucracy;
Be patient, flexible, and retain your sense of humour.
The combination of obtaining a visa, getting from the airport to the city,
securing accommodation, hiring a car and finding an interpreter can be the
hardest part of the visit.
All or part of these needs can be handled by the services department of the
British company, Hull Blyth, which has operated in Angola for more than 150
years and has offices in Luanda, Lobito, Cabinda and elsewhere. (London: 71

FT  12 MAY 92 / Survey of Angola (17): Shaky, erratic recovery - The diamond
industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CAROLINE SOUTHEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THESE are critical and exciting times for Angola's diamond industry as it
rides a switchback which has seen production peak at 2.3m carats in 1974 and
slump to 714,000 in 1985.
A somewhat shaky and erratic recovery will be sustained, say officials from
Endiama, the state-owned company, and the government's department of geology
and mining. Mr Jose Dias, the department's secretary of state anticipates
that production will rise to nearly 1.4m carats next year.
The officials believe that foreign investors will respond to improved fiscal
terms and a new mining law, introduced earlier this year, which allows
private companies a greater role in the sector.
The sector's growth in the medium to long term lies in the development of
the country's rich kimberlite potential. Most of Angola's diamonds are
currently mined from alluvial operations in Lunda Norte, chiefly the Cuango
division.
At a development cost of some Dollars 1bn, several kimberlite pipes already
identified in Cuango might yield production of an estimated 3m-4m carats a
year.
The recovery from the mid-80s slump began in 1986 when the state operator,
Diamang - which had a monopoly on official production - was dissolved and
Endiama was established to reorganise the sector.
Endiama, still the sole concessionaire, sought to encourage foreign
investors back into the sector. Following the peace agreement last year, its
policy is beginning to bear fruit.
After a five-year break, Endiama early last year returned Angola's diamonds
to the international fold when it agreed with De Beers Centenary, the
Swiss-based mining and marketing organisation, to sell all its Cuango
production through the Central Selling Organisation (CSO), which purchases,
values and sells nearly 80 per cent of the world's rough diamond production.
The agreement with De Beers also included a Dollars 50m loan to further
develop the production from the Cuango region. The loan has now been fully
drawn down to finance a seven-year contract with Odebrecht, a Brazilian
company, to explore and mine diamond reserves in the Cuango.
The project, brainchild of Mr Noe Baltazer, Endiama's managing director, is
the most ambitious embarked on by the company. It includes the construction
of a high-tech, self-sufficient operational headquarters at the remote site
of Luzamba in the Cuango region.
'The Luzamba project is now the centre of gravity of our operation. Most
importantly, it involves setting up a huge exploration programme in this
area,' says Mr Baltazer.
RST International, a subsidiary of Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines,
originally signed an agreement with Endiama to mine diamonds around Cafunfo
at the end of 1986 (a year which had seen organised operations almost grind
to a halt in the Lunda Norte) and remains in operation, its contract renewed
annually.
The alluvial operations in Lunda Norte remain particularly threatened by
illicit digging and selling. Industry officials estimate that illegal sales
of high quality gems could be costing the country as much as Dollars 5m a
week. Diamond exports earned Angola Dollars 190m last year, down from
Dollars 242m in 1990.
Angola, the seventh-largest diamond producer in the world in volume, is
capable of 'making it into the first league', according to an industry
official. However, according to western experts, the explosion in illegal
sales poses a threat to the industry and to Endiama. De Beers, for its part,
has had to buy stones on the open market at market rates in an attempt to
stabilise supply.
A rise in illegal mining, particularly in the Cuango region which produces
80 per cent of Angola's diamonds and some of its highest quality gems,
partly explains the rise in illicit sales. Cuango sites have been flooded by
thousands of diggers since the peace accord last May which allowed freedom
of movement for the first time in 16 years.
Illicit trading was further fuelled, western analysts believe, by a law
introduced at the end of last year, now under review, which gave individuals
the right to own and sell diamonds.
However, these factors do not fully explain the increase. 'We could be
looking at 13,000 carats a week. That would involve a lot of digging,' says
one industry official.
In the murky world of illicit diamond dealing, rumours abound while proof
remains elusive. Popular theories include Unita releasing its stockpiles
following the peace agreement, to Endiama complicity.
These problems will be resolved, officials believe, by a restructuring of
the industry. Legislation introduced at the beginning of this year paves the
way for an end to the state's monopoly of the mining sector. The law
envisages that both foreign and local private companies can invest in
prospecting and mining.
The law covers prospecting and research, exploration and exploitation, and
taxation. Mr Dias says private, mixed or state companies can work alongside
each other, with state enterprises no longer taking precedence.
'We arrived at the conclusion that state enterprises were fully concerned
with administration - and were bad administrators,' he said.
However, the reforms may fall short of investor expectations, for mining
rights have not been made transferable and saleable, and the government
still decides who is competent to operate.
Investor confidence has nevertheless been boosted by the news that De Beers
and Endiama, are due shortly to sign an agreement which both sides say will
set precedents for future deals in the mining sector.
The agreement involves De Beers investing Dollars 50m on evaluation of known
kimberlite deposits and prospecting for new primary deposits in Angola.
The flexible fiscal regime being negotiated as part of the deal is expected
to set precedents which will prove attractive to foreign companies, not just
mining houses.

FT  12 MAY 92 / Survey of Angola (16): Resilience despite hardship -
Benguela / Farming and manufacturing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK BLUM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE six-hour drive from Luanda to Benguela was instructive. The route, too
dangerous to travel before the ceasefire, is now becoming popular - despite
occasional banditry on some sections of the journey.
Teams of road menders repaired long-neglected potholes and fresh fish was
for sale on stretches where the road hugs Angola's picturesque coast: small
but important signs that peace has returned to Benguela province.
But the main objective was to visit the factories and farms in and around
the towns of Benguela and Lobito, 500km south of Luanda and commercial hub
of a province stretching across 32,000 sq km.
What emerged were tales of hardship and deprivation, stark images of sad,
squalid shanty towns, gangs of pitiful urchins roaming the city streets. But
what also became clear from tours of the factory floor and talks to farmers
was an extraordinary resilience, and a capacity to improvise.
It is Angola's second most important manufacturing region, as well as an
important centre for agriculture and fisheries. And while less badly hit by
the war than other provinces, it suffered considerably from the collapse of
the Benguela railway which used to run across the country from Lobito, the
province's main port, to the border with Zaire.
At independence, Lobito port handled more than 2m tonnes of cargo a year.
Today, the only activity is provided by occasional imports of food and
consumer goods. Its warehouses are empty or shelter neatly lined-up
fork-lift trucks, and its reduced workforce is idle.
Outside the two cities, factories are running at a fraction of capacity and
others are not working. A big cement factory once owned by Secil, a
Portuguese company that was nationalised when Portugal's own revolution took
a turn to the left in 1975, is derelict.
Farming has suffered from the war and prolonged drought and although
conditions have improved recently, agricultural production of basic foods is
expected to cover only 51 per cent of the province's needs this year,
according to official statistics.
There is much anxiety about the outcome of next September's election but for
the time being, it is business as usual. This means self-reliance,
improvisation and a lot of patience to cope with inadequate equipment and
supplies, scant finance, bureaucracy, erratic telecommunications - lines
with Luanda can suddenly go down - and poor but improving transport.
Ten months of peace have brought a modest but welcome renewal of activity
and increased orders.
Mr Manuel Carmo, technical director at Robbialac, a paint manufacturer and
subsidiary of Jenson &amp; Nicholson, says business is picking up with two
recent orders for 650 tonnes of paint.
The factory, located on the outskirts of Lobito, was established in 1972. It
employs 63 workers and produces about 500 tonnes of paint a year although it
is equipped to produce 7,000 tonnes. Mr Carmo says the biggest problem is
lack of materials. 'Sometimes we might just miss one crucial product and we
can't produce.' Production was at a standstill in October and November.
All materials are imported from Europe and paid for in dollars. Imports have
to be officially approved and lack of foreign currency causes delays.
'We're told foreign exchange is available and all we need to do is go to the
bank to get approval for our imports, but when we go there, the bank doesn't
have any money.'
The company was recently allowed to remit profits covering the 1975-88
period and it is looking to expand its activities in Angola.
Mr Alberto Lima, production director at Empresa de Assistencia Technica
Industrial, a state-owned company that produces water pumps and hammer mills
which are used to ground seeds, says his company also wants to expand but
this will depend on receiving financial aid.
The plant was established 60 years ago and was nationalised in 1976. It
produces about 1,400 pumps a year on mainly Bulgarian-made machinery, much
of which is only two years old. Mr Lima says, however, that he would like
more up-to-date equipment. 'We're going to need more modern machines as we
expand.'
Lupral, an engineering company that makes tools, pipes and other industrial
and agricultural equipment, has one of the largest speciality foundries in
Angola, says Mr Carlos Castro, general director. Run under management from
the Eternit group in Belgium, it employs 700 workers.
The group also has a factory in Huambo. This was built in 1977 but never
used. The company hopes to start production there later this year. Demand
for agricultural tools and equipment has risen strongly, Mr Castro says.
Africa Textil is one of the biggest employers in the region with about 1,500
workers. It is a 97.2 per cent state-owned joint venture with Tritex of the
UK, which holds the remaining 2.8 per cent.
Purpose-built in the late 1970s to produce high quality cotton cloth, plant
installations are in good order. But last year, it was operating at a
fraction of capacity because of supply and foreign exchange problems.
Angolan cotton production collapsed after 1975 and what is produced
domestically is not of good enough quality, says Mr Manuel Lopes Henriques,
the manager. All cotton has to be imported from Tanzania. Chemicals come
from Europe.
The company has a five-year investment plan under which it has already
bought new machinery. 'We need to modernise. Some of our machines are of a
past generation,' says Mr Lopes Henriques. More foreign investment and
know-how would be welcome but, he says, the government must protect local
industries from foreign competition.
Foreign investment could play an important part in the province's revival
but most investors are waiting for the elections - and the uncertainty is
encouraging trade and speculation rather than investment.
Benguela faces very much the same problems as other provinces although its
economy was particularly hard hit by the closure of the railway. A
resumption of domestic, if not international traffic, would be a boost, and
there is international interest in helping to rehabilitate the line.
Mr Paulo Jorge, the provincial governor, is confident Benguela can prosper
again. 'We can be a kind of rear-guard for other provinces. Benguela has the
port and it has the railway, and they will play a big role in transporting
goods to and from Huambo, Bie and Moxico provinces.'

FT  12 MAY 92 / Survey of Angola (15): Farmer with an important role -
Profile of Albertino de Oliveira
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK BLUM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN the fighting between government troops and the Unita rebels was at its
worst in Benguela province, Albertino de Oliveira found himself caught in
the middle. As bad luck would have it, his farm happened to be located in an
area where some of the fiercest clashes took place, but he shrugs the memory
off with a laugh.
Unlike the vast majority of settlers who left the country in 1975, Mr de
Oliveira stayed put. He continued to farm during the difficult years of the
civil war and today he is one of a small band of private farmers who have
not only survived but whose very survival bears testimony to the resilience
of private endeavour and grit in the face of near-impossible odds.
Today, he is relatively prosperous in a country that has faced famine and
that still suffers from extensive and visible poverty - and from widespread
shortages of even the most basic necessities. In the past, Mr de Oliveira's
success might have caused official disapproval.
Then, instead, the emphasis was on the state's role in capital-intensive
agriculture in which unrealistic production targets were to be achieved with
expensive but inappropriate machinery. An unofficial monument to the failed
policy can be found in an open field not far from the De Oliveira farm: a
row of rusting East German combine harvesters.
Today, the government has made rehabilitation of agriculture, especially
food production, a top priority. Any endeavours that will boost production
are now welcome. And while Mr de Oliveira's farm and others like it will not
solve on their own Angola's food crisis, they are making a small but
important contribution towards that aim.
Set on 25 hectares of land ceded by the Benguela railway company, the farm
stretches across the plains surrounding Benguela, the provincial capital. It
produces some 450 tonnes of onions a year, tomatoes, lettuce and other
market gardening produce.
About 200 workers, half of them women, clear the land, plant, tend and pick
the crops. But that is where any similarities with management of equivalent
farms in more propitious circumstances ends. Survival and the ability to
improvise have been indispensable qualities to overcome the ravages of war
and drought and the handicaps caused by lack of equipment, erratic transport
and next to no technical or financial support.
Drought is still affecting the province but peace has brought some
improvements as the roads are open again to traffic. 'Before, we couldn't
sell our products', says Mr de Oliveira. Most of the farm's produce is sent
to Luanda where it fetches better prices, but he expects transport
bottlenecks by July as conditions improve and farm production rises.
He says conditions for private farmers have not changed since the war ended.
Fertilisers and herbicides have been practically unavailable since 1975 and
farmers make up their own from whatever chemicals they can find locally.
The price of equipment is high - a three-cylinder pumping system costs Kz18m
 -and credit is unavailable. 'For private sector farming there's no credit.
I've heard of European Community help for pumps, but I haven't seen
anything.' He thinks he may be able to put up the farm as security for
credit 'but the situation is unclear.'
Sitting at a large table in the courtyard of his small house in Benguela
with friends - mostly local farmers who seem to drop in at all hours - Mr de
Oliveira is better off than most local inhabitants. But he says there are no
incentives to produce more. 'There's nothing in the shops and my wife has to
go to the parallel market to find most things, from cooking oil to clothes.'
Like most farmers, he is not over-interested in politics. His concern is to
ensure the farm is able to produce and survive. Having come through 16 years
of civil war, his keenest wish now is to re-equip the farm with modern
machinery. 'We don't have anything. A good tractor or lorry or irrigation
equipment would be useful. We need to clear everything and start again with
new and better equipment.'

FT  12 MAY 92 / Survey of Angola (14): Poised for a fresh start -
Agriculture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK BLUM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AFTER more than a decade and a half of decline, Angola's agriculture could
be poised for a new start. The end of the civil war last year, and good
rain-falls in most parts of the country, have raised expectations that a
modest recovery is on the way.
Officials report an increase in activity in the countryside since the war
ended and forecast a 15 per cent rise in food production this year. If
confirmed, it will be the best result since 1980. But there is still a long
way to go before Angola regains food self-sufficiency, and the rest of
agriculture remains deeply in crisis.
Agriculture was thrown into turmoil after independence and the departure of
Portuguese settlers. Farms, plantations and food processing industries were
abandoned and vital commercial and servicing structures collapsed. The civil
war exacerbated the crisis and production went through a precipitous decline
leaving the country - once an exporter of agricultural produce - dependent
on food aid. Food imports rose rapidly to reach Dollars 242.7m in 1984,
according to the World Bank.
Among the main export crops, coffee production fell from 210,000 tonnes
before independence to about 7,000 tonnes in the late 1980s; cultivation of
cotton fell from more than 110,000 tonnes in 1973 to 307 tonnes in 1986;
maize production - once Angola's fifth largest agricultural export and an
important element in the local diet - fell from almost 900,000 tonnes in
1975 to 290,000 tonnes in 1986. Production of most basic foods, from rice to
beans and potatoes, declined markedly. The livestock sector fared no better
with the number of cattle slaughtered for meat falling from 157,000 in 1973
to fewer than 18,000 in 1985.
Mr Benjamin Castello, deputy minister for agriculture, says low production
was the result of war, natural catastrophes - drought in the south and
floods in the north - and of misconceived policies.
'Agricultural policy was not properly adjusted to conditions. There were
good intentions but the policy failed to take into account the human factor.
People didn't participate in the policy and there was an over-reliance on
mechanisation. There were no incentives to improve production and as a
result rural trade disappeared.'
Large state farms were given priority and preferential treatment over
small-scale or subsistence farming, but they performed badly due to poor
management, lack of technical preparation and misplaced attempts to meet
unrealistic targets.
In the early 1980s, the government shifted support towards small farmers. An
emergency plan was approved in 1984 with the aim of reducing the state's
role in production. Inefficient and unpopular co-operatives were turned into
peasant associations, enabling farmers to pool their resources but allowing
them to retain and sell the products of their own work.
'The co-operatives were often set up bureaucratically without real local
participation. State companies exploited the peasants as if they were new
colonialists,' Mr Castello says.
Agricultural Development Stations (EDAs) were created in the countryside to
provide technical and financial support for peasant associations, including
help with access to production inputs and distribution. The measures helped
to stabilise prices and led to a rise in production in spite of the war, Mr
Castello says.
Economic reforms known as the Saneamento Economico e Financeiro (SEF),
introduced in 1988, should also help. These include: liberalising prices,
allowing greater private sector activity and investment in the transport,
retailing and wholesale sectors, opening up credit facilities, and
decentralising decision making.
Foreign investment is encouraged, especially in the service sector whose
inefficiency is seen as one of the biggest barriers to development.
Land and large plantations left vacant by the departure of settlers and not
currently used will be sold. The government plans to privatise all coffee
plantations and foreign companies will be invited to tender for the larger
ones.
Before independence, Angola was the world's fourth-largest coffee grower,
producing a record 4m bags of coffee and generating exports worth Dollars
206m in 1972-73.
Most coffee plantations were in the less populated north and workers were
contracted from the south - where the rebel Unita forces were strongest -
and the migrant flow stopped during the war. Many plantations were neglected
and most will need substantial investment because many coffee trees are dead
or diseased.
Several groups are interested, including Espirito Santo of Portugal which
owned a big plantation in central Angola, but much depends on what happens
after next September's elections.
Mr Castello says a new property law clarifying land ownership will be passed
soon. 'All investors, foreign or Angolan, want this reassurance. Anyone who
wants to invest can come to the ministry, explain what they want to do,
whether 100 per cent foreign or a joint venture, and we'll see what we can
do.'
The flight of hundreds of thousands of people from their homes poses another
problem. Countless villages are deserted and about 40 per cent of the
population now lives in urban areas. As people drifted to towns in search of
safety and work, the proportion of Angolans engaged in agriculture dropped
by half from 74.5 per cent in 1970 to 35.5 per cent in 1985.
There are signs that people are starting to move back to the countryside,
and as security and communications improve this is likely to accelerate.
Many government officials see the successful resettlement of these displaced
families as fundamental to the country's future. 'As long as Angola's
peasants are poor, Angola will remain poor' argues Mr Costello: 'We have to
create the framework for all Angolans to enrich themselves. The creation of
wealth will guarantee stability in the country.'

FT  12 MAY 92 / Survey of Angola (11): Key to Angola's survival since
independence - The oil industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CAROLINE SOUTHEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ANGOLA'S oil industry, largely protected from the vagaries of civil war and
political uncertainty, has boomed during the past four years and the success
story seems likely to continue for the rest of this decade.
Oil has been the key to Angola's survival since independence - the sole
underwriter of the war effort and guarantor of its international debts.
Within 25 years, Angola has become sub-Sahara's largest producer after
Nigeria, with the region's second-biggest reserve base.
Recoverable reserve estimates over the next five years for fields in
production, under development and those being lined up totals some 4.9bn
barrels.
Although the oil industry survived the turmoil of independence better than
any other sector of the economy, production began to flag in the late 1970s,
leading to a reorganisation of the sector between 1976 and 1979. The
changes, which included the establishment of Sonangol as the government's
business arm responsible for co-ordinating and controlling petroleum
activities, resulted in a steady rise in production from 1982.
Factors which attracted foreign companies to Angola 10 years ago - low
operating costs, prospects for new discoveries and favourable contractual
terms offered by Sonangol - are still drawing new investment into the
sector.
A further attraction is that Angola has never been a member of Opec. This
has allowed it flexibility to sell what crude it can produce.
Mr Joaquim David, director-general of Sonangol, the state-owned oil company,
says with some pride: 'The companies that began with us in the initial years
have stayed and new ones have been drawn in.'
Peace for the country has coincided with record exploration levels and the
discovery of lucrative deep-water wells. Sonangol in turn has begun to offer
an innovative licensing regime which is proving highly attractive to foreign
companies.
Under the regime - known as a 'rate of return' profit oil - the percentage
of production left to the investing company varies according to the field's
level of productivity.
Mr David is optimistic. 'Oil is a growing industry. Our production is five
times what it was in the last years of the the Portuguese administration. We
have every reason to believe upstream development will grow.'
The importance of the sector cannot be over-estimated. Oil accounts for more
than 90 per cent of total export earnings. Last year, crude oil exports
earned Angola some Dollars 3.15bn compared with Dollars 3.55bn in 1990.
The highest level ever of exploration activity in the offshore sector last
year is set to assure oil's paramount role in the Angolan economy. A surge
of development is now anticipated which should boost output from its 1991
level of 505,000 b/d to 680,000 b/d in 1996. Of the current output of
555,000 b/d, Chevron accounts for 300,000 b/d, Elf 165,000 b/d, Texaco
55,000 b/d, Belgium's Petrofina 30,000 b/d and Italy's Agip 5,000 b/d.
In tandem, offshore operators have prepared extensive expansion plans.
County NatWest WoodMac, in a report on the the West African oil industry
drawn up early this year, estimates that expenditure in Angola will peak in
1993 and 1994 at Dollars 750m each year.
Capital investment has grown rapidly over the past 3 years, from Dollars
210m in 1988 to about Dollars 500m in 1991. This compares with a previous
high of Dollars 532m (1992 prices) in 1987.
Mr Matthew Shaw of County NatWest Woodmac predicts that over the next nine
years some Dollars 4.7bn of upstream investment is envisaged, compared with
Dollars 3.3bn spent over the past nine years. Those expected to make the
biggest commitments are Chevron in Cabinda, Texaco in Block 2 and Elf in
Block 3.
'Chevron has a high degree of commitment to our Angola operation. In
international terms it is one of the big five. In investment terms it will
be at the top during the next three years. After 1995 it should be the
biggest in liquid production,' says Mr Bob Connon, managing director of
Cabinda Gulf Oil Company (Cabgoc).
Cabgoc, in association with Sonangol, Elf Petroleum Angola, and AGIP Angola,
operates the offshore concession of Cabinda. Area A of this concession is
presently producing 310,000 b/d. The production sharing agreement (PSA)
gives Sonangol 41 per cent, Cabgoc 39.2 per cent, Elf 10 per cent and AGIP
9.8 per cent.
There is no production yet from the deep-water Areas B and C of the Cabinda
concession. However, a three-year contract for the first phase is due to be
signed shortly with Setal of Brazil and Lummis of Sweden. The contract
covers the structures, treating and pumping equipment and the pipeline to
shore. The complete development of the project up to first production,
including this contract, is worth more than Dollars 400m.
The cost is explained because of the expense of drilling in deeper water of
about 350ft. The maximum water depth of current production is slightly over
200ft. The first oil is expected to flow in 1994. Peak production could
reach an estimated 100,000 b/d.
Mr Connon says the development is comparable to 'three large events in our
history in Angola since we started in in 1954.' These included the
development of Takula field in 1982, the introduction of waterflooding at
Takula and the first development in the Malongo field.
Onshore, where activity was effectively stalled by the civil war, drilling
is set to be resumed within the next couple of years. In the Cabinda
enclave, an area that has not been drilled since Cabgoc relinquished its
concession in 1971, BP and Occidental are due to sign new contracts although
the first well is not expected until 1994.
On the mainland, where the war severely disrupted work, exploration work
could resume. Some exploration acreage is already licensed to Fina and in
the longer term new areas could be licensed although this is not expected
until the end of the decade.

Joaquim David, general manager of Sonangol, the Angolan state oil company
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CAROLINE SOUTHEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Southey: What are the prospects for Angola's oil sector?
David: It is a growing industry. . . and now the war is over there is an
atmosphere of hope in the future.
The companies that began with us in the initial years have stayed and new
ones have been drawn in. We have every reason to believe the upstream
development will continue to grow, and we are also exploring the country's
gas potential.
Sonangol, with its foreign partners, is looking actively into developing
refining capacity. We have one refinery and here in Angola production is
balanced with demand. Although South Africa seems to have excess refining
capacity, there may be other markets where environmental restrictions are
damaging the development of new refineries.
What about onshore developments?
We are in negotiations for onshore exploration. We are close to signing
contracts for two areas. Another is at a very early stage.
You have indicated you will privatise the distribution system, now a
Sonangol monopoly. Has there been any advance?
We are developing a price mechanism which we believe will attract foreign
sector investment down stream. The Ministry of Petroleum has approved the
proposed price structure and we are in the process of inviting companies to
invest. Within the next two to three months we expect some results.
Is there a review of production sharing terms?
No, although we review laws and where there are weak points we make
adjustments or proposals. We have a standard production sharing agreement
(PSA) but we negotiate on a case-by-case basis with investors. We also try
to standardise the fiscal terms so that we have more uniformity and a more
readily controllable system.
Are you reviewing price cap clauses (which give government the benefit
should prices rise above a certain level)?
We made a major change in principle in deep water contracts. Normally in
shallow waters we made a split between Sonangol and the contractor based on
accumulated oil production. In deep waters we are doing it based on cash
flow and rate of return after a certain time. It was a major change which
seemed to please both Sonangol and investors as it took into account higher
investments required for deep waters.
Is there a greater flexibility on Sonangol's part in negotiations with
foreign investors?
No, we have always been flexible. What we have now is that accumulated
experience which allows us to fine tune some aspects.
Has Sonangol sold oil forward?
We have had to commit some oil for the financing of the first big deep-water
development of Cabinda. But normally we make one-year contracts, most of
which are renewable and are linked to credit lines. We have one exception, a
contract that will end in 1994.

FT  12 MAY 92 / Survey of Angola (13): Opinions differ over future -
Minerals Industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CAROLINE SOUTHEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ANGOLA'S mineral industry is littered with projects abandoned by local and
foreign operators after the onset of civil war following independence in
1975.
A combination of political stability and an attractive business climate
could see a substantial expansion of a sector currently dominated by oil and
diamonds, say local officials.
Western experts are more cautious, concerned about the country's poor
infrastructure and generally weak international markets for many of the
potential mineral exports.
Excluding the two key foreign exchange earners - oil and diamonds - mining
production currently represents less than 3 per cent of GDP and
approximately 6 per cent of total exports. These figures could rise
comparatively rapidly, say industry officials, if abandoned workings are
brought back into production and previously untapped resources are
exploited.
Iron ore exports, for example, earned 11.7 per cent of the then Portuguese
colony's earnings in 1970, making it the fourth-ranking economic activity in
Angola and the country a medium-sized producer of the mineral. Angola also
has extensive deposits of phosphates, copper, quartz, uranium, manganesem
wolfram, gold, mica, sulphur, nickel, limestone and silver which have yet to
be fully exploited, notes Mr Jose Dias, secretary of state for geology and
mining. 'Our mining industry has been neglected for a long time and we are
only at the beginning of its development. No new investment has been made in
mines. Many of our minerals have been forgotten,' he says.
The government, which recently surrendered its monopoly on all mineral
rights, is trying to encourage investment in the sector. This year it
introduced a new mining law which makes it possible for private foreign and
local companies to invest in prospecting and mining.
The state mining companies are also seeking to negotiate more flexible
fiscal terms with private companies which will take into account the cost
and rate of return of developments.
Mr Dias says the government is considering proposals from RTZ, Anglo
American and De Beers on future developments.
Ferrangol, set up in 1981 with the responsibility for exploiting iron ore
and manganese deposits, is now closed and being held on a care and
maintenance basis. A combination of instability caused by the civil war and
the depressed international market made the resumption of iron ore mining
economically unrealistic until recently.
Between 1968 and 1973, exports averaged 5-6m tonnes, but war halted
production at the largest iron ore mine at Cassinga, near the Namibian
border, the centre of an area that was regularly attacked by South African
and Unita forces.
With the establishment of peace, there is a possibility that mining could
resume. However, the extent of iron ore reserves and their value on today's
international market has yet to be established.
Export prices are expected to remain uncompetitive because of exorbitant
transport costs. Road and rail links were prime targets for attack and their
repair rehabilitation has not begun.
Three additional mining companies have been formed since independence:
Fosfang, in 1979, to initiate exploration of phosphate deposits, Minaquartzo
in the same year was given the concession for quartz mining in Cuanza-Sul
province, and Roremina was established in 1978 to take over work previously
done by the sub-commission of quarries.
The quartz mines controlled by Minaquartzo are currently closed. Angola's
quartz competes with comparable products from Madagascar, Sri Lanka and
Brazil. Dunes, the South African-British group, is reported to be considered
a joint venture contract with Minaquartzo. Foreign experts estimate
investment of Dollars 3m would be needed to recover the previous level of
quartz production - about 2,000 tons a year.

railway
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
DOWN at the Lobito repair workshop, engineers are diligently patching up
locomotives damaged by bombs during the civil war. Along a short siding,
engines that have been too badly hit are gradually stripped of any parts or
equipment that can be used to repair others.
Mr Ernesto da Rocha, chief engineer at the workshop, says that 12 General
Electric locomotives, seven from the US and five from Brazil, are now in
working order. Four more are being repaired and another five await their
turn. Ten locomotives were too severely damaged to offer any scope for
repair - causing an estimated loss of Dollars 18m. Mr da Rocha hopes to have
14 locomotives in good running condition by June.
The rehabilitation of each engine is a painstaking task but one on which
depends the future of the Caminho de Ferro de Benguela (CFB), once regarded
by enthusiasts as one of the world's last great railways. For Angola, the
line that runs eastwards from the Atlantic port of Lobito, 500km south of
Luanda, to Zaire and the central African heartlands was a cause for pride
and an important source of foreign exchange revenues until the civil war
Between 1972 and 1974, total freight traffic on the railway averaged about
3m tonnes annually, including mineral exports of 535,000 tonnes from Zaire
and of 325,000 tonnes from Zambia. Import traffic to the two countries was
an average 550,000 tonnes annually. Total revenue peaked at Dollars 43m in
1974.
Regular international services allowed passengers arriving at Lobito by ship
from Europe to travel in comfort all the way to Lumbumbashi, formerly
Elisabethville, in Zaire, or to Lusaka, the Zambian capital. The trains had
sleeping accommodation and showers in first class and a restaurant that
offered smoked ham and melon, Portuguese salt cod and Angolan giant prawns.
Now that peace has been signed, officials hope that the railway will be
restored, if not to its former status as a vital artery for central and
southern African trade, at least sufficiently to play a crucial role in the
recovery of Angola's internal provinces. But even this more modest objective
will be difficult to achieve.
The 1,300km line to Luau on the border with Zaire has been considerably
damaged by war and 16 years of neglect. Apart from a few brief intervals,
the line has been effectively closed to international traffic since the
onset of the civil war in 1975, with intermittent freight services to
Huambo, 400km away, until 1988. Thereafter, trains only run on the 30km
coastal stretch between Lobito and Benguela, the provincial capital, to
provide a primitive if regular passenger service.
Irregular traffic between Lobito and Huambo resumed last year, but only for
freight.
Work has been going on to rehabilitate this part of the line and Mr Lukoki
Sebastiao, BFB finance director, says he expects trains to resume normal
traffic to Ganda, about half way to Huambo, by the end of May.
Further east, the extent of the damage has yet to be fully assessed. Initial
surveys, incomplete because many parts of the line are still inaccessible,
suggest the track is in a very bad state with wood rail sleepers burnt or
worn out and at least 75 bridges needing repair, he says.
Lack of funds is a big handicap in efforts to rehabilitate the railway and
several plans have had to be shelved or cut back as a result.
In 1987, the government and the Southern Africa Development Co-ordination
Conference (SADCC) agreed on an ambitious 10-year 'Lobito corridor'
development plan which included rehabilitating the railway, improving
adjacent infrastructures including roads, sanitation, sewerage, water and
electricity supplies, repairing Lobito's port, and developing civil aviation
facilities from the local airforce school airport.
The cost was estimated at Dollars 575m at 1987 prices with Dollars 346m for
the railway alone. Efforts to win international financing for the plan
floundered because of the war and in 1989 a new emergency plan was dawn up.
This focused on the link to Huambo and would have cost Dollars 94m with
Dollars 33m to be spent on the railway, Mr Sebastiao says.
This plan has now been replaced with a crash programme - aimed at restoring
traffic between Lobito and Kuito, 584km east, at an estimated cost of
Dollars 17m - to carry out partial repairs allowing the track to be fully
operational (up to Kuito) in 1995.
The rehabilitation of the rest of the line to the border will take place in
a second stage, depending on the outcome of discussions with the World Bank
later this year. Under World Bank auspices, work on a new comprehensive
study of the Lobito Corridor began last January and is expected to be
completed in July. Before that, discussions will take place with Zaire and
Zambia to assess the railway's prospects.
It is unlikely that the railway will ever be fully restored to its past
glory, but even a partial restoration would play an important role in
helping to rebuild Angola.

FT  12 MAY 92 / Survey of Angola (9): Port is still well equipped - Lobito
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK BLUM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE sleepy port of Lobito, once an important stop-off point for exports of
minerals from Zaire and Zambia, awaits its renaissance. Lobito's port, like
most of Angola's transport infrastructure, has suffered from the war,
although in comparison with Luanda it has emerged in far better shape from
the years of civil conflict.
Set in a natural harbour formed by a 5km sand-spit, the port remains
relatively well equipped with six deep-water berths and a long coastal quay,
all of which are in a reasonable state of repair.
A large number of the original cranes and fork lift trucks have been kept in
relatively good order, the port is remarkably tidy and, unlike in Luanda,
there are no serious problems of security and theft, says Mr Belmiro
Ferreira, head of the port authority's finance department. Local businessmen
also say that formalities are processed more speedily than in the capital.
In 1973, the port handled 2.6m tonnes of cargo, traffic having risen sharply
in the preceding years. It has fallen to a fraction of that volume but Mr
Ferreira is confident that with peace Lobito can once again play a leading
role in the national and provincial economy. 'Now that the war is over, and
the roads are opening up, there are good perspectives for the port.'
Some rehabilitation work will be needed to bring installations and equipment
up to the standards required to meet any rise in traffic. An emergency plan
has been drawn up which includes rehabilitation of infrastructures and
purchase of cargo handling and maritime equipment and of vehicles. The plan
envisages investment of about Dollars 14m and Spanish financing for the
first part has already been agreed, Mr Ferreira says.
It used to be said that without the Benguela railway Lobito would not exist
and that without Lobito port the railway could not function. Mr Ferreira
agrees that a resumption of international traffic on the Benguela line would
have a crucial impact on Lobito. But the port would benefit also from a
resurgence of domestic agriculture and mining, both of which have declined
dramatically since the war. Before that, a large quantity of agricultural
exports, especially maize from the Huambo and Bie provinces, as well as iron
ore from Cuimba, were exported through Lobito.
Nowadays there are no exports out of Lobito and ships are a rare sight in
the port. But once the road northwards is fully refurbished, Lobito could
become an attractive alternative to Luanda where long delays are common and
security is a nightmare for shippers.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
ALMOST every night short bursts of gunfire reverberate around the port of
Luanda as thieves and security guards clash.
The conflict's disastrous impact on the Angolan economy has encouraged the
growth of a parallel economy whose most visible expression is the vast Roque
Santeiro black market on the capital's outskirts, and where everything that
cannot be found in government stores is on sale.
Many of those goods have been stolen from the port, often with the
complicity of port officials and police.
Stealing from the port is a lucrative if dangerous business, with many of
the spoils ending up in the vast Roque Santeiro black market on Luanda's
outskirts.
Security is not the only problem. The port, once considered one of the
finest on the western coast of Africa, suffered from the war as exports
collapsed - except for oil which is shipped almost entirely from the
oil-producing province of Cabinda.
Until independence, Luanda was the main port for agricultural exports
including coffee, cotton, sugar, sisal, palm products, tobacco, rice, and
maize. In 1973, total freight shipments in and out of Luanda, including
trans-shipments of copper and iron and refined oil products, was 2.3m
tonnes.
By 1983, traffic had fallen to below 700,000 tonnes as a result of the
disruption of road and rail links, the closure of mines and plantations, and
foreign restrictions on imports - which now account for the bulk of freight
traffic. Shippers currently estimate that 300-400 tonnes of general cargo,
and about 120 containers, are unloaded daily.
Behind the port's elegant colonial facade, installations have reached an
advanced state of neglect which will need substantial investment to correct.
Access roads and freight handling equipment are in a poor state, and most of
the and electric cranes do not work. It is not uncommon for ships to use
their own derricks to unload. Port regulations demand that shippers pay for
the cranes regardless, so there has been no incentive for the port
authorities to repair or replace damaged equipment.
Many of the port's facilities were originally designed to handle large bulk
exports and are inadequate for the type of imports now shipped. The port
lacks appropriate warehouses and cold storage facilities. Rubbish and
discarded equipment lies openly between run-down warehouses. Close to 6,000
containers, many of them damaged, wait to be emptied or shipped out, making
them easy targets for thieves.
The government has handed over the management of the piers to mixed
state-private companies to improve efficiency, but they are handicapped by
conditions in the rest of the port. Roll-on roll-off cargo has priority, so
have food imports, but delays are common and ship's papers must be fully in
order to avoid a long wait.
'If all cargo documents are sent to us at least two days before the ship
arrives in Luanda, we can prepare the documentation and begin to organise
things at this end to make sure goods are cleared as soon as they get here,'
says Mr Antonio Fernandes, shipping manager for agents Hull Blyth.

FT  12 MAY 92 / Survey of Angola (6): Formidable obstacles - Foreign
Investment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL HOLMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ARGUABLY no country in Africa has been blessed with greater resources than
Angola: oil and diamonds, plentiful fertile farmland with rivers that flow
all year, huge marine resources, natural harbours, and an area five times
the size of Britain but with only 10m people.
The ruling MPLA party and Unita, their main rivals in the September
elections, agree that foreign investment is essential if this cornucopia is
to be developed.
But the would-be investor faces some formidable obstacles, ranging from
complex legislation to corruption, a slow-moving bureaucracy and all the
problems associated with a country desperately short of skilled personnel
and an infrastructure ruined by war.
While acknowledging that much may have to be done, government officials
point out that the 1988 investment law guaranteed remittance of net profits,
contained provision for tax holidays, exemption from or reduction of customs
duties on imports of capital goods and spare parts, and a guarantee of fair
compensation in the event of expropriation - reinforced by Angola's decision
to sign the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agreement (Miga).
Funding from development agencies, led by the World Bank, should be
available to reinforce the private sector role in priority investment areas,
say officials. These include agriculture, food processing, mining, fishing
and fish processing and construction. Advice is available from the Foreign
Investment Office* whose role is to answer queries from abroad, evaluate
proposals and act as co-ordinators.
Would-be investors planning to make commitments before the September poll
may need to tread carefully, however.
Unita failed to secure the government's agreement to a proposal to establish
a joint body to oversee foreign investment policy and decisions during the
pre-election period. The result, claim party officials, is a number of
questionable deals by government officials taking advantage of what may be
their last opportunity to secure kickbacks or commissions.
The trenchant tone of Unita's criticism of the foreign partners involved has
concerned some businessmen and diplomats. They acknowledge that Unita has
grounds for concern but suspect there is within the party a strong streak of
economic nationalism, whose advocates are ideologically opposed to
substantial foreign business involvement in the economy.
Unita officials deny this and reaffirm the party's commitment to its
investment code, published in July last year.
Declaring its support for a 'private enterprise-based market economy', the
party document 'recognises the critical role of foreign investment in
providing access to foreign capital, technology, management skills and
foreign markets.'
A Unita government will 'actively encourage' investment in commercial
agriculture and agro-business, fishing, mining, oil and petrochemicals,
energy, and manufacturing, says the code, which also offers guarantees on
remittances of profits, dividends and royalties.

FT  12 MAY 92 / Survey of Angola (7): Lop-sided trade links - Relations with
South Africa
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL HOLMAN and PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FROM beer to prefabricated housing, from spare parts to office equipment,
South African products are reaching Angola in increasing quantities.
There has long been a South African connection through the diamond industry.
Now the continent's industrial super-power is rapidly moving into what its
businessmen describe as one of the most important markets in Africa,
challenging traditional European suppliers.
The bitter years of enmity and hostilities between Pretoria and the Angolan
government have been consigned to history. Pretoria's representative office
in Luanda will soon be upgraded. The South African embassy and residence,
vacated shortly before independence in 1975, will be returned to their
pre-independence owners as soon as alternative accommodation can be found
for the present occupants - the Polish diplomatic mission.
Most South African businessmen express enthusiastic belief in Angola's
potential, modified by concern about political stability and dismay at the
bureaucracy, housing shortages and poor communications they encounter in
Luanda.
The market potential of a country which exports more than 500,000 barrels of
oil a day (b/d) is not conveyed by the latest available trade figures, which
precede the diplomatic rapprochement. In 1990, South African imports from
Angola were negligible (R59,000) but exports reached R50m.
The lop-sided trade relationship could change. Apart from providing an
outlet for Angola's oil (there is speculation that a substantial barter deal
is in the offing), South Africa could be an important market for Angolan
fish-meal.
South African construction companies are preparing to take part in the
rebuilding and development of Angola's infrastructure - bridges, roads,
ports. Much of this could be World Bank-funded, says Mr Andrew Maggs of the
South African Foreign Trade Organisation (Safto), which has organised trade
missions to Angola.
The country's oil sector is also a large market for South African companies,
businessmen believe. As well as being a potential service and equipment
base, South Africa is a logical place from which to source all the consumer
needs of a 10,000-strong oil workforce which requires regular delivery of
fresh food and consumer goods - hardly any of which is supplied locally.
The Standard Bank has had a representative in Luanda since the start of the
year, and the group may be opening a branch later this year. Meanwhile, one
of the South African companies with the highest profile is Murray &amp; Roberts
Construction. At the end of February the company signed a protocol with
Cabinda province and the Angola government covering training in the
construction and engineering industries, supply of prefabricated houses,
schools and hotels, and a range of other services including work on roads
and in the agriculture and mining sectors.
But one businessman with wide experience of black Africa urges caution: 'No
big decisions are being taken until the elections are over and there is
greater certainty. Any long-term agreements may have to wait until then.'

BURDENED by an Dollars 8bn-Dollars 9bn external debt which even a thriving
oil sector cannot service, grappling with the legacy of war, and acutely
short of management skills, Angola has embarked on the painful path of
reform under the tutelage of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the
World Bank.
A budget deficit of more than 25 per cent in 1990 has to be cut, the kwanza
remains over-valued despite last month's devaluation, and the balance of
payments deficit has risen steeply from Dollars 6m in 1985 to Dollars 1.25bn
in 1990 and did not improve last year, according to central bank estimates.
'The government is working closely with the IMF in its efforts to address
these issues,' says a senior official in the finance ministry. While
stressing the administration's determination to cut spending and pursue a
privatisation programme, the official is frank about the difficulties
stemming from years of mismanagement as well as the civil war.
The recovery effort follows a gruelling era. The collapse of Angola's
flourishing, diversified pre-independence economy was dramatic, even by the
standards of a continent accustomed to disaster.
A GDP growth rate averaging nearly 7 per cent in real terms had been built
on exports of oil, coffee, diamonds and iron ore, and a manufacturing and
industrial sector rivalled in Africa only by South Africa.
The tumult of 1974-75, marked by the exodus of 350,000 Portuguese settlers
and a growing civil war, marked the start of a catastrophic decline.
Coffee exports have fallen from more than 200,000 tonnes to a few thousand,
ore output has ceased, diamond production remains below the pre-independence
peak of 2.1m carats, a surplus of basic food has become a deficit and the
industrial sector operates at perhaps a quarter of production capacity.
Only the oil sector has thrived - up from 170,000 barrels a day (b/d) before
independence to more than 500,000 b/d, accounting for over 90 per cent of
export earnings, at least half of which have been spent on the war.
Whichever political party wins next September's elections, the priority of
the incoming government will be to seek an agreement with the IMF, followed
by an early meeting with the Paris Club of official creditors.
The imprimatur of the Fund is a pre-condition to the urgently-needed
rescheduling of Angola's external debt - Dollars 7.7bn at the beginning of
1991; at least Dollars 8bn today.
With debt service payments due this year of at least Dollars 1.6bn, and
forecast export earnings of about half that, rescheduling is essential to
economic recovery.
Over the past five years the MPLA government has been dismantling the
edifice of state controls, cautiously at first, more vigorously since
becoming a member of the Fund in September 1989.
Three successive reform plans - in 1987, 1989, and 1990 - tackled the
Angolan economic malaise, which the first of the plans so candidly described
as: 'The excessive centralisation of socialist planning methods and
consequent bureaucratisation of economic direction. . . disorganisation and
mismanagement of companies, lack of discipline and rampant corruption'.
The 1990 programme marked the shift from promise to practice: spending was
cut and revenue boosted in an effort to reduce budget deficits exceeding 25
per cent. Prices were increased and most price controls lifted, and the
kwanza was devalued, taking effect in March 1991. A currency changeover
designed to mop up excess liquidity was also introduced. Old and new notes
were exchanged at par, but only 5 per cent exchanged for new kwanzas, the
balance in government bonds.
Last year, new legislation on the financial sector was introduced providing
for a new commercial bank and a credit institution for agriculture and
fisheries.
Professor Fatima Roque, 'minister-designate' of finance in the opposition
Unita, has committed the party to what amounts to radical structural
adjustment programme towards the same destination: a market-driven economy
with a competitive exchange rate and the once-dominant state-controlled
sector reduced to certain core services.
But it is the MPLA who must put principles into practice, imposing the
rigours of adjustment on an electorate they are trying to woo. And until
adjustment policies have been applied with sufficient rigour to satisfy the
Fund, there will be no repeat of the Paris Club's decision in 1989 to make
an exception to the rules, when arrears and maturities falling due in the
period through September 1990 were rescheduled.
But Angola faces such a formidable set of problems, say officials; it
deserves a sympathetic and flexible response from the Fund and creditors.
As Professor Roque comments in an analysis of Angola's predicament: 'There
is no body of experience available - with regard to the application to the
theory of timing, scope, speed or the sequences of reforms - to guide Angola
in its transition from a centrally-planned to a market economy.'
Government officials say they will not be distracted from the reform task by
the coming election. But while the commitment may remain, implementation of
the transition programme makes their task even more difficult. The election
exercise itself will be an expensive exercise, and there is also the cost of
funding the demobilisation of the bulk of the two rival armies.
Soldiers returning to civilian life receive lump sum payments and government
is also pledged to retraining and resettlement assistance.
'The peace dividend will come,' said one official, 'but not as quickly as we
had hoped.'
Implementing the reform blueprint may have to wait until after the polls.

Jonas Savimbi

<TEXT>
MR Jonas Savimbi cuts an incongruous figure in the Portuguese colonial house
he temporarily inhabits in Luanda. The guerrilla leader turned politician
today seems less confident of his role and more thoughtful about the future.
The Angolan capital has been his base since September when Unita, the
movement which has fought a guerrilla campaign against the MPLA government
since independence in 1975, transferred personnel from its headquarters in
Jamba in southern Angola.
Mr Savimbi, 58, who studied in Lisbon and Lausanne, has led Unita since he
launched it in 1966. After completing his degree in 1965, he left
Switzerland for China where he trained in guerrilla warfare.
Politically he says he now stands 'more in the centre than on the right or
on the left.' On economic policy, he believes in the free market economy
because, he says, 'private ownership creates incentive.'
After 16 years of war, the transition is painful - from rural guerrilla base
to urban life, from waging war to preparing for power, from army leader to
politician.
The transition to democracy and the end of the cold war have both proved
mixed blessings for Mr Savimbi.
'We have been getting support from South Africa, from the US. The major
motivation to support us was to fight communism. Today that is not there.
Now the Americans would deal with an MPLA government which won the election
just as it would deal with a Unita government.'
The process is already under way. South Africa is establishing relations
with the MPLA government in Luanda while the US has expressed concern over
allegations of human rights abuses within the rebel movement. Unita has
recently admitted to the murder late last year of two of its senior members
by fellow Unita compatriots.
Mr Savimbi says 'the incidents have to be deeply deplored.'
He adds: 'It was not a decision of the leadership. It was differences in our
own ranks. Which is why on our side we accept responsibility. I accept
responsibility. Because it is my organisation.'
The unity of the organisation, once cemented by the common enemy of
communism, is showing signs of strain. Mr Savimbi admits that he is finding
it difficult to convince his fellow commanders of the efficacy of peace and
the merits of a democratic party.
Fellow Unita members are also baulking at changes within the organisation.
'In a party you have to accept different thinking - a different line does
not mean that people have to go away from the party but that these people
are on the left, these people are on the right. But it is one party. In a
guerrilla movement you can't do that. You always have to think about the
objective. And everybody will try to conceal or to concede his difference so
that the objective has to be attained. That is the real difficulty,'
explains Mr Savimbi.
Mr Savimbi was adamant that Unita would 'never go back to guerrilla war'.
'If we lose the elections, which up to now I don't think will happen, like
Mr Kinnock, we will have to go to party and ask people to make a judgment of
me'.

FT  12 MAY 92 / Survey of Angola (4): Remarkable somersault - Profile of
President Jose Eduardo dos Santos
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL HOLMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN a speech remarkable for its frankness, and poignant in its
acknowledgement of good intentions that went disastrously wrong, President
Jose Eduardo dos Santos signalled a turning point in Angola's history.
Delivering what may prove to be the epitaph of Angola's ruling party or the
manifesto for its revival, he told delegates attending the third congress of
the ruling Movimento Popular de Libertacao de Angola (MPLA) party that they
could not resist the tide of history.
It was December 1990. Sixteen months later, Mr dos Santos is still engaged
in his formidable task, presiding over the transition from war to a fragile
peace, from authoritarian one-party state to a multi-party democracy, and
from Marxism to a market economy.
The Angolan electorate is scheduled to go to the polls at the end of
September to pass judgment on a remarkable ideological somersault by the
MPLA leader. 'Some see him as a pragmatist,' observes a former Angolan
politician, now retired from the fray, 'others see him as an opportunist,
determined to stay in power at all costs.'
Wherever the truth lies, the 49-year-old son of a bricklayer will need to
draw on all his political skills when helping guide his party and Angola
through the months ahead.
Mr dos Santos, one of the two key players in Angola's peace process, was
only 37 when he succeeded Dr Agostino Neto, the country's first president,
who died after emergency surgery in a Moscow hospital in 1979.
His credentials were impeccable. Born in Luanda and a member of the Mbundu
tribe, the ethnic base of the MPLA which makes up almost a quarter of
Angola's population, he joined the party at the age of 19 in 1961, the year
which marked the start of armed resistance to Portuguese rule.
As the colonial government cracked down on dissent, Neto fled north to Zaire
where he became vice-president of the MPLA youth movement in Kinshasa. After
two years he took up a scholarship to study petroleum engineering at the Oil
and Gas Institute of Baku, in Azerbaijan, then part of the Soviet Union.
After graduating in 1969, he took a military telecommunications course and
the following year joined MPLA guerrillas in the Angolan enclave of Cabinda.
Elected to the party's Central Committee and Political Bureau in 1974, he
became independent Angola's first foreign minister in 1975.
In August 1987, President dos Santos announced that Angola would seek
membership of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and a further reform
package paved the way to admittance in September 1989.
As the 1988 US-brokered peace process took effect, with South Africa ceding
independence to Namibia in return for the withdrawal of 50,000 Cuban troops
based in neighbouring Angola, so the pace of economic and political change
quickened.
'A real democratic revolution dominates today's world', President dos Santos
told the MPLA congress in December 1990 - the last to be held under Angola's
one-party system. 'With good sense, realism and caution,' the president
continued, 'Angola will able to attain peace'. Sixteen months later, his
message holds good.

FT  12 MAY 92 / Survey of Angola (2): Peace process enters its final stage -
Politics / Examining the background
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL HOLMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ADJACENT election posters in the heart of Luanda extol the virtues of
war-time rivals Jose Eduardo dos Santos and Jonas Savimbi. Nearby, a
newspaper vendor is doing brisk business: headlines announce the arrival of
a South African military team to help clear minefields in southern Angola
laid by their compatriots.
The scene provided a striking image of the dramatic political changes now
under way in Angola.
The regional peace process which began in 1988, when South Africa prepared
to concede independence to Namibia in return for withdrawal of 50,000 Cuban
troops from Angola, is entering its final, delicate stage.
Deprived of external military support, enervated by 16 years of conflict,
and prodded by Washington and Moscow, President dos Santos and Mr Savimbi
signed a ceasefire last May. If all goes to plan, Angola will hold its first
multi-party elections at the end of September, monitored by the United
Nations.
Although more than 20 parties are planning to contest the poll, most
observers agree that the only substantial contenders for power are the two
protagonists in the war: the ruling Movimento Popular de Libertacao de
Angola (MPLA) and Mr Savimbi's Uniao Nacional para a Indepencia Total de
Angola (Unita).
Hopes that a third political force might emerge, capable of preventing the
MPLA or Unita from securing outright victory, were probably dashed late last
month. Mr Joaquim Pinto de Andrade, former honorary president of the
Democratic Renewal Party (PRD), and widely respected for his stand on human
rights, resigned after alleged vote rigging for a new executive at the
party's national convention.
The PRD had emerged as probably the best organised and most credible of the
parties formed since Angola introduced a multi-party system as part of the
peace package. Unless the party recovers its unity, the prospect of a
substantial challenge to the big two shifts from the slim to the negligible.
The only election assessment advanced with any confidence is that Unita will
retain the loyalty of what has been its strongest ethnic constituency, the
Ovimbundu, about 35-40 per cent of Angola's population, while the MPLA will
get strong backing from the Mbundu, who make up about a quarter.
Voters not influenced by ethnic considerations face an invidious choice.
The bitter shanty town graffiti 'MPLA robs, Unita kills' pungently
summarises popular concern over two issues: growing official corruption,
amid allegations involving improper contracts and sales in the oil and
diamond sectors; and revelations about the murder of two senior Unita
officials at the instigation of some their colleagues.
Mr Tito Chingunji, Unita's former secretary for foreign affairs, and another
leading member, Mr Wilson dos Santos, were murdered towards the end of last
year in Jamba, the party's base in southern Angola. The reasons remain
unclear. But the disclosures, accompanied by other accounts of human rights
abuses, have done lasting damage to the reputation of Mr Savimbi. They have
also deeply embarrassed the US which provided military and other support to
Unita during the war, as well as financial backing subsequently.
So overwhelming is Mr Savimbi's domination of the party that many observers
find it hard to believe that he was not in some way responsible for the
killings.
The MPLA does not have clean hands. Hundreds, perhaps thousands, of alleged
supporters of an abortive coup attempt in 1977 were rounded up at the time.
Many were arbitrarily and secretly executed; to this day relatives are still
trying to determine their exact fate.
Little divides the two parties on economic policy. Both parties subscribe to
the structural adjustment principles set out by the International Monetary
Fund (IMF) and World Bank - although Unita can point to a long-standing
commitment to capitalism in contrast to the MPLA's relatively recent
conversion from Marxism.
Any voter hoping to select a party on the basis of its foreign policy will
still have a difficult choice to make.
Trade and pragmatism are forging links, once inconceivable, between the
erstwhile Marxist MPLA government in Luanda and a white-led government in
Pretoria. The MPLA has made it clear that it will not repay an xbn arms debt
to the former Soviet Union, its war-time ally.
For many Angolans, the greatest worry, however, is not who to vote for, but
whether the exercise can reach a successful conclusion.
Ms Margaret Anstee, the UN Secretary-General's representative in Angola and
head of the team monitoring the process, makes clear that what she describes
as 'the world's cheapest peace-keeping operation' could do with more help.
One western diplomat put it bluntly: 'It has the makings of a nightmare.'
Unita was preventing government access to some of the areas under guerrilla
control; the government seemed to be dragging its heels, failing to appoint
key election organisers; rudimentary communications; an acute shortage of
transport; and a late start to the registration of voters.
But one of the greatest concerns involves the future of some 150,000 members
of the MPLA and Unita armies, facing either demobilisation or a career in an
integrated force. The settlement agreement called for demobilisation by
August 1, and a 50,000-strong national army in the barracks by election day.
By the end of April, only 6,000 had been demobilised. Military officials say
that thousands of men have failed to report to the 45 designated assembly
points where their weapons should be collected. They reckon it unlikely that
more 20,000 men could trained and registered in the new army by September.
If political tensions rise, the potential for violence seems formidable. To
add to these headaches, there are disquieting developments in Cabinda. The
faction-ridden Frente de Libertacao do Enclave de Cabinda (Flec) has
recently stepped up a campaign for independence, or possibly autonomy, with
attacks on traffic between Cabinda town and Mulongo, base for the offshore
operations of Angola's leading oil producer, Cabinda Gulf Oil Company.
Ms Anstee acknowledges that there may be trying times ahead. In a jocular
reference to UN Security Council Resolution 747, the mandate for the Angola
operation, she makes a serious point: 'I have been asked to fly a 747 and
I've got only enough fuel for a Boeing.'

FT  12 MAY 92 / Survey of Angola (1): A daunting task ahead - Angola could
play a key part in the development of the southern African region, given
peace and the right policies. But the task of rehabilitating an economy
shattered by war is enormous, while political divisions may prevent
post-election co-operation needed for Angola's recovery
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
AFTER three decades of conflict, Angola has embarked on a revolution which
could at long last realise the potential of the most richly endowed country
in Africa.
Marxism has been replaced by a market economy, one-party rule has given way
to multi-party elections scheduled for late September, and two exhausted
rival armies have begun to demobilise, paving the way for a single,
integrated national defence force.
Unlike many of the African states hit by man-made or natural disasters,
Angola can generate, or attract, much of the capital its recovery requires;
or as much as its weak administration can efficiently use.
Oil production exceeds 500,000 barrels per day and is rising. Its diamond
wealth is already being exploited, other mineral and marine resources are
barely tapped, there is plentiful fertile land and a relatively small
population - 10m people in a country five times the size of Britain.
Given peace and appropriate policies, Angola could play a key part in the
development of the southern African region.
That said, the scale of the task is nevertheless daunting. Most assessments
of African countries which stress potential have to acknowledge a backdrop
of disaster. Angola is no exception.
Thirty years of conflict, exacerbated by economic mismanagement by an
autocratic, avowedly Marxist MPLA government, has left the people exhausted.
Drought has compounded their misery and at least a million Angolans urgently
need food aid. Much of the infrastructure is ruined or in disrepair,
including the 1,300km Benguela railway.
The exodus of some 350,000 Angolans of Portuguese origin during the chaotic
run up to independence in November 1975 was a trauma from which the country
has still to recover.
Angola was deprived of the bulk of its skilled personnel - an indictment in
itself of Portugal's colonial legacy. From the elegant office blocks along
Luanda's palm-fringed marginale to factories in Benguela, from grand
plantations on the fertile plateau to the network of rural stores, nearly
all were abandoned.
Today Angola's cities and towns show some signs of recovery: restaurants and
bars reopening, a few buildings being renovated. But, overall, Angola seems
a vast African version of a Potemkin village, the eye deceived and reality
kept at bay until the observer gets closer.
From a distance, the leafy streets, with their traditional red-tiled houses,
and elegant shop fronts seem to have survived the ordeal.
But the houses and flats are often without services, display cases are
usually empty, and urchins scrabble through the rubbish.
These are the comparatively fortunate towns. In the south, where fighting
was heaviest, some centres are little more than rubble.
It is all part of the incalculable cost of three wars: the struggle for
independence and a civil war which grew into a battle between proxies of the
super-powers, with invading South African forces supporting Mr Jonas
Savimbi's Unita movement and 50,000 Cuban soldiers reinforcing the MPLA
government army.
Directly or indirectly, the conflict is reckoned to have accounted for
hundreds of thousands of Angolan lives. Many fled the countryside to the
relative sanctuary of the towns and cities where the densely-packed shanties
are as impoverished as any in Africa.
Their flight was a further blow to the agriculture sector, already hard hit
by the loss of nearly all of the large-scale commercial farmers. From being
the world's fourth-largest coffee producer, output plummetted from some
210,000 tonnes in 1973 to a few thousand tonnes. Once self-sufficient,
Angola soon had to import food.
Today Angola is virtually a mono-economy, dependent on a quasi autonomous
off-shore oil enclave for more than 90 per cent of its export earnings. The
country's unofficial market, whether in goods or hard currency, dominates an
economy in which corruption is widespread.
To outsiders at least, a post-election coalition seems essential if Angola
is to recover from this tragedy. The task of rehabilitating a shattered
economy is enormous, and skilled personnel are at a premium.
Yet officials from both main parties appear to rule it out, and the score or
more of smaller parties are expected to make little impact in the poll.
Opposition to the concept stems not from fear of alienating hard-line
supporters, but out of an antipathy hardened by the war, and reflecting
ethnic rivalries: Unita draws considerable support from the Ovimbundu, who
make up an estimated 35-40 per cent of Angola's population, while the MPLA
gets strong backing from the Mbundu, about a quarter of the population.
This antipathy is one of the factors that makes many observers uneasy about
Angola's chances of clearing the first hurdle on the path to recovery:
completion of the transition programme.
Some of the concern stems from the belief that Angola has bitten off more
than it can chew. Preparations for the elections on September 29-30 are
running behind schedule: the director-general of elections has yet to be
appointed, for example, while voter registration will not start before late
May. In a country with a derelict infrastructure, a ineffectual civil
service and a far-flung electorate, this may be too late.
The demobilisation process is also in jeopardy. Not only is it making
painfully slow progress, but it seems probable that arms are being
stockpiled by both sides in secret caches before soldiers enter the assembly
camps.
It is now accepted that demobilisation will not be complete by the end of
September. The new integrated national army is unlikely to be adequately
trained or at full strength. The prospect of Angola going to the polls under
these circumstances is potentially disastrous.
It also seems clear that the UN team, due to total 450 soldiers and
policemen and 400 observers, operating on a budget of about Dollars 100m, is
understaffed and under-funded. The contrast with the resources available for
the UN role in Namibia's transition to independence is striking.
UN officials point out that their duties in Namibia included the
organisation of the poll: in Angola this is supposed to be the government
responsibility. But it took a 6,500-strong force and a budget of more than
Dollars 450m to ensure fair elections in Namibia, with a population of
one-tenth Angola's, an excellent transport network and working telephones.
As the election date draws closer, tensions seem to be growing between the
country's two key politicians and the parties they lead: President Jose
Eduardo dos Santos of the ruling MPLA party, and Mr Savimbi's Unita
guerrilla movement.
Driven more by the imperatives of a new world order than inspired by a
spirit of compromise, the two men last May signed an agreement to end the
civil war which began in 1975, but soon took on a new dimension as super
power rivalries helped bring South Africa and Cuba troops into the arena.
Inter-party enmity remains not far below the surface. At Huambo, in central
Angola, a major in the United Nations contingent monitoring Angola's peace
process, shakes his head in dismay over the rivalry between government and
Unita forces: 'They cannot even agree on an agenda at their meetings'.
For many, such tension raises the fear that Angola is set to repeat the
disaster of 1975.
Outbreaks of fighting, initially between the MPLA and Mr Holden Roberto's
FNLA, were followed by clashes between the MPLA and Unita.
The pre-independence interim administration, established after the coup in
Portugal led to Lisbon's surrender of its African colonies, collapsed.
By the time the late Dr Agostino Neto, the MPLA's founding president,
proclaimed independence on November 11 1975, the schism in Angolan politics
had become unbridgeable.
Some Angolan politicians discount the fears. 'The world is a different place
today,' argues a senior Unita official.
'We can no longer turn to Pretoria or Washington; the MPLA has lost Moscow,
the Cubans won't come back. . . and we both know that if we break the
(transition) agreement Angola won't get foreign aid.'
This is almost certainly true. But Angola's off-shore oil wealth may be
temptation enough should democracy not have taken root by September.

THE former Soviet Union's five central Asian states, plus Turkey, Iran and
Pakistan, failed at the weekend to agree on a framework for their economic
integration at a summit meeting in the capital of Turkmenistan. A central
obstacle was the political rivalry between Turkey and Iran in the area.
The proposals under discussion included the construction of road and rail
links between Turkmenistan and Iran which would link the newly-independent
central Asian states with their neighbours in the south.
Other items on the agenda were a united customs policy, various trade
agreements and proposed oil and gas pipelines from central Asia to Turkey
and Iran. The most controversial proposal was the plan for an oil pipeline
between Kazakhstan's Tengiz oilfields and the Gulf port of Bandar Abbas.
This was blocked by both Kazakhstan and Turkey, which fears it would give
Iran a potential stranglehold over central Asian oil exports.
The participants did, however, reaffirm their commitment to the less
concrete goal of political co-operation.

FT  11 MAY 92 / Survey of Lincolnshire and South Humberside (7): Investment
defies the recession - Agriculture and food-processing continue to be
dominant industries
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE

<TEXT>
LINCOLNSHIRE tulip bulbs, exported to Amsterdam; Lincolnshire ducks,
savoured in Japan; Lincolnshire ducks' feet, highly esteemed in China;
Lincolnshire peas, computer-monitored in their pods - the county's
centuries-old agricultural industry has certainly moved with the times.
It is the British county most heavily dominated by agriculture. The sector
employed 8.8 per cent of the county's workforce in 1987, compared with a
national average of just 1.5 per cent.
According to the National Farmers Union, Lincolnshire is Britain's biggest
producer of cereals, potatoes, vegetables and oil seed rape. Sugar beet,
poultry, pigs, flowers and bulbs are also important.
The county has been affected by agriculture's trend towards increased
mechanisation: between 1978 and 1988, total numbers working on
Lincolnshire's land, including farmers and casual and part-timers, dropped
from 29,486 to 23,167, and the decline in jobs continues.
But it has also seen heavy investment by major food companies, despite the
recession. It has benefited, too, from proximity to both Grimsby, a major
food-processing centre, and to the Humber ports whose east-facing location
will become increasingly important as a result of the single European
market.
Agriculture dominates Lincolnshire physically: the sparsely populated county
has only eight centres with more than 10,000 inhabitants. And the sector
also has important spin-offs, such as agricultural engineering.
But the Rural Development Commission, promoting diversification, has been
spending Pounds 2m a year on small factory and workshop developments since
the early 1980s, when much of the county was designated a rural development
area. All RDA boundaries are being reviewed next year.
As elsewhere, there is concern over the GATT negotiations and reform of the
common agricultural policy. A more localised worry - even harder to
influence - is the spate of dry summers which have hit the county's
irrigation systems.
'The real crunch will come if we get another dry and hot summer,' says Mr
David Hill, the NFU's East Midlands senior policy adviser. The NFU is
pressing the government to consider how water could be transferred, possibly
into the Trent river system.
Recent private-sector investments in Lincolnshire include Christian
Salvesen's new Pounds 8m vegetable-packing factory at Easton, near Grantham,
claimed to be Europe's most advanced. The company, the largest UK processor
of frozen green vegetables, has three large plants in Lincolnshire and
another at Grimsby.
HL Foods, part of Hillsdown Holdings, operates three production centres in
Lincolnshire, including a new chilled-salads factory at Spalding, described
as the UK's most up to date. Another major food company, Geest, is
headquartered at Spalding, where its Tropical Produce distribution centre
has recently been refurbished. Geest's subsidiary, the Pasta Company, is now
developing a large pasta-processing complex at Barton-on-Humber, in South
Humberside.
Other well-known Lincolnshire-based names include Nickerson Group (exporters
of ducks to the Far East), near Caistor, and William Sinclair Holdings, of
Lincoln, producers of horticultural, pet and equestrian products. The county
is also home to a number of successful producer co-operatives.
Some north Lincolnshire fields are yielding a new cash crop - oil - while,
on the coast, Conoco's new Theddlethorpe gas terminal, linked to the
Lincolnshire Offshore Gas Gathering System, will supply up to a third of the
UK's natural gas needs.
The importance to Britain's food industry of the land from the Humber to the
Wash is underlined by the presence in Grimsby of 400 food-processing
companies. Promoted as 'Europe's food town', it estimates that 20,000 people
work in its food sector and directly related companies.
Since 1989, food manufacturing investment in the town has exceeded Pounds
75m, including a Pounds 25m pizza factory, Europe's largest, developed by
Ross Young.
Despite the loss of deep-sea trawling in the mid-1970s, about half the
town's food processors are fish-related - Grimsby still has a fleet of 100
Seine netters and the UK's largest fish market. Fish is also imported for
processing. And the town has an honourable role in sustaining a great
British tradition: most English fish-and-chip shops are serviced within 24
hours from Grimsby.
Despite all this, the food-processing sector last year delivered Grimsby a
major blow - news that Findus, moving out of fish-finger production in the
UK, was to close its local plant, costing more than 900 jobs over two years.
The knock-on effects of closure would be serious: Findus' gross annual wages
bill locally is Pounds 7m. Its contracts with 130 local suppliers are worth
Pounds 1.8m. Now, however, Booker, part of the Fitch Lovell food
conglomerate, has expressed interest in taking over the plant. A deal
depends on whether government assistance will be granted.
All this has heightened annoyance in Grimsby that the town is an
intermediate area, while Scunthorpe, with lower unemployment, is a
development area, offering inward investors more incentives. It has not
escaped the notice of 'Europe's food town' that, since 1984, its steelmaking
neighbour has won 1,200 food-sector jobs - Scunthorpe now has seven
substantial food plants, compared with just one before.
In the dog-eat-dog world of lobbying for government aid, Grimsby, with its
above-average jobless rate of 10.9 per cent, is arguing that it needs at
least as good a deal as Scunthorpe.
Unusually, Grimsby's manufacturing sector is dominated by two unlikely
bedfellows - food and chemicals. The chemical industry, employing 3,200
people, lies within the borough and to the north along the coastal strip
towards Immingham.
It is investing very heavily in 'green' technology. But combining food and
chemical industries as environmental standards rise will not be easy, admits
Mr Roy Bentham, Grimsby's director of leisure and economic development. 'As
years go by, we have to make sure the two don't affect each other
adversely,' he warns.

FT  11 MAY 92 / Survey of Lincolnshire and South Humberside (8): A trawl
through history - The coastline means ports, tourism and the heritage
business
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SCRATCH 'N SNIFF, orders the 'very smelly leaflet' about Grimsby's new
National Fishing Heritage Centre. So you do - and the whiff of fish and
engine oil rises up from the page.
Opened a year ago, this imaginative museum, an attempt to plunge visitors
into the sensations of 1950s North Sea trawling, has received an
enthusiastic public response. It attracted 70,000 visitors in its first
eight months, and has created almost from thin air a tourist industry for
Grimsby, once the world's largest fishing port.
The Pounds 3m development, funded jointly by the European Community and
Grimsby council, promises visitors the chance to 'sign on' as crew members
before travelling through an imitation Grimsby back street to the Arctic
fishing grounds.
'You feel the pitch and roll of the ship, the urgency and excitement of the
catch, the raw, icy blast of the wind . . .' promises the glossy brochure.
More is in store: an 'exhibition', opening later this month, will allow
visitors, securely on terra firma, to 'experience the harsh reality of being
under enemy fire on the gun-deck of a trawler at war', before switching to
the German side and cowering in a recreated U-boat being depth-charged.
'It's mine blowing,' screams the publicity. 'Feel the submarine shudder,
hear the tortured metal fracture . . .'
All this may arouse misgivings among those uneasy about Britain's heritage
industry. There is indeed irony in recreating the dead trawling industry
next door to a new Sainsbury's hypermarket; while Grimsby's nearby fish
dock, somewhat tatty, as genuine backstreets tend to be, but at least still
operating, is not deemed a tourist attraction. The fish dock is also
fighting for government cash towards a Pounds 16m upgrading.
But then, Billy Butlin perhaps ruffled feathers when, in the 1930s, he
decided that Skegness, where he had set up his hoopla stall with a borrowed
fiver, should become the site of his first UK holiday camp. And before that,
the Earl of Scarbrough's agent probably alarmed Lincolnshire villagers in
the 19th century when, on his recommendation, Skegness was developed into a
seaside resort.
Today, Skegness and Mablethorpe, the Lincolnshire coast's main resorts, and
Cleethorpes, just inside South Humberside, retain their traditional British
seaside character, despite some substantial investment, including the Pounds
27m spent by Rank Leisure on Funcoast World, successor to Butlins at
Skegness.
Lincolnshire and South Humberside Tourism - a body set up in 1990, with
local authority, tourist board, private sector and Rural Development
Commission backing, to promote tourism - estimates that Lincolnshire
attracts 5m day-visitors and 7m overnight stayers annually.
The organisation's manager, Mr Christopher 'Kipper' Scott, says tourism in
Lincolnshire employs 28,000 people for part or all of the year, and
generates a Pounds 310m annual spend.
Believing that tourism in the area has development potential, he has
launched a national advertising campaign. So far it has sparked 10,000
requests for the county's short breaks and main guide.
At present, Lincolnshire tourism is concentrated on the coastal strip, which
has traditionally catered for visitors from Yorkshire, the East Midlands and
Lincoln. The area now has to compete with year-round theme-park developments
such as Centre Parks' Sherwood Forest complex. A recent CBI report, Towards
2000 in Lincolnshire, suggested the county consider creating such a
facility.
Efforts are being made both to encourage more visitors to Lincolnshire,
especially from East Anglia and south-east England, and to coax more of them
into the county's many attractive historic towns and villages. Mr Scott is
also wooing walkers and nature-lovers by emphasising the coast's nature
reserves.
Nor will devotees of Alfred Lord Tennyson escape Lincolnshire's entreaties:
this year, the 100th anniversary of his death, he is being invoked to
promote Mablethorpe, where he spent part of his youth. 'I think Lincolnshire
has 'calm and deep peace' to offer,' ventures Mr Scott, in Tennysonian mood.
Along the coast, in Grimsby, the local authority hopes tourists attracted by
the National Fishing Heritage Museum will be persuaded to linger, and spend
money, at the recently completed Pounds 50m Freshney Place shopping centre,
a mixture of town centre refurbishment and redevelopment. Further
rejuvenation of the Alexandra Dock, where the museum has been built, is also
planned.
Whimsy and nostalgia fade away north of Grimsby; the no-nonsense might of
South Humberside's chemical installations and its large Immingham port
complex have yet to be 'interpreted' by industrial tourism.
The elegant Humber bridge attracts some tourists, but most developments here
appeal mainly to local job-hunters. Kimberly-Clark, for example is
developing a new Pounds 100m paper products plant at Barton, creating 750
jobs.
The Humber estuary - consisting of the four main ports of Hull, Goole,
Grimsby and Immingham and numerous wharves on the rivers Trent, Ouse and
Hull - has seen trade rise by 50 per cent in a decade. It now handles 60m
tonnes of goods a year, and regularly services 52 countries.
The European single market looks certain to boost further the estuary's port
activity. Markets serving 320m European customers - 740m if you include
eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union - can be reached within 24 hours
from the Humber. It already handles most UK trade to and from Germany,
Belgium, Holland and Scandanavia.
Further investment of more than Pounds 100m in the Humber ports is in the
pipeline. With more than 100 berths run by more than 20 operators, many of
the estuary's distinctive ports and wharves have established particular
strengths in certain operations.
One remarkable feature of the estuary is that, thanks to its rivers, it
stretches 50 miles inland, allowing ships to be discharged close to major
motorways and feeding into Yorkshire's canal network. Sadly, however,
Britain's most inland port, Gainsborough, on the Trent, is experiencing
problems, because twists in the river make it unsuitable for larger vessels.
How long, one wonders, before the tourist influx arrives?

FT  11 MAY 92 / Survey of Lincolnshire and South Humberside (6): Engineering
keeps its place - Lincoln enjoys a splendid site, but a mixed economic
landscape
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CATHEDRAL broods over the city. High on the hill, it tells travellers
coming in from the surrounding flat lands that their destination is near.
For Lincoln is the focal point of the region, a fact recognised as early as
the 12th century when the city received its royal charter.
'It is thought of as a small market town with a cathedral. But it is a
significant industrial and commercial centre - this is the reality,' said Mr
Mike Roberts, of the city's economic development department.
Arguably, it is the economic diversity of the city that has enabled it, if
not to avoid the recession, at least to escape its most damaging effects.
Unemployment in the Lincoln travel-to-work-area is just under 10 per cent
and close to the national average.
However, in the city itself unemployment is unofficially estimated at up to
four percentage points more; and up to half of those without jobs are
long-term unemployed.
The economic landscape is mixed. Historically, the city has been an
engineering centre. Indeed, the tank was devised, developed and built in
Lincoln during the first world war.
Nationally, engineering has been in the doldrums. But in Lincoln, European
Gas Turbines, part of GEC-Alsthom, has a heavy order-book; while
rationalisation at GPT, the telecommunications group now managed from
Swindon, has caused redundancies. Over the past decade, old names like
Ruston Bucyrus, with its earth-moving equipment, have disappeared and
emerged in smaller and more specialised form; but new names such as Rose
Bearings, the fruit of Japanese takeover and investment, have emerged as
more powerful local economic forces.
The engineering industry provides about 8,000 jobs in a local economy where
there is employment for around 74,000. Engineering employment is more
significant than tourism, where, even including the jobs in pubs, the total
is about 5000.
Tourism is not as important as the dominance of the cathedral might suggest.
Lincoln is not, for example, on the American visitor circuit. Although about
1m people may visit the city each year, most only stay for a day. Tourism is
an industry awaiting exploitation. While there has been some expansion of
hotels, the concern of the Confederation of British Industry remains valid:
'The lack of facilities in Lincoln and Lincolnshire, such as hotels and
basics, like cinemas, means that, apart from the summer season at the coast,
Lincolnshire does not attract as many tourists as it could accommodate.'
For the CBI, there is another possibility: Lincoln could be a tourist base.
'Good hotels, a full and imaginative use made of the Brayford Pool (the
harbour built by the Romans) and exploitation of Lincoln's very historical
and important Roman and medieval past could help the whole county.'
But the thrust of investment in Lincoln is more narrowly based. Development,
especially in retail facilities like the Waterside shopping centre, has
continued despite the recession. And there will be more. GW Padley is
planning a new food-processing plant; Anglian Water is moving some
headquarters staff to a refurbished engineering works once owned by Clayton
Dewandre and now by Simons, the construction group; the Inland Revenue is
establishing its training headquarters in an old bishop's palace.
To what extent such development can ease the problem of the long-term
unemployed is not clear. The city does not escape the problems of economic
and social deprivation that are characteristic of UK cities. For the most
part, problems are concentrated in the city's eastern wards.
Lincoln is not on the list of the government's 57 Urban Programme
authorities, and hence does not receive 75 per cent grant aid for specified
economic renewal projects. City leaders noted that, on most indices of
deprivation (quality of housing, lack of education facilities, the number of
one-parent families) Lincoln's eastern wards were as badly off as most Urban
Programme authorities. But what the city does not have, the leaders
observed, is a social difficulty with ethnic minorities. Indeed, according
to government criteria, it is entitled only to the subsidy of Derelict Land
Grant.
Efforts to persuade the government to make available more subsidies for
regeneration have failed. But the government is more enthusiastic about a
joint public-private sector approach to regeneration, on the model of the
now superseded Birmingham Heartlands, called Investors In Lincoln. This
groups the City Council, the Training and Enterprise Council, the Lincoln
Co-operative Society, the Chamber of Commerce and six local development
companies, with sponsorship from East Midlands Electricity.
How Investors In Lincoln will approach its task will be clearer later this
year. By the end of this month, Drivers Jonas, the London chartered
surveying consultancy, should produce a study which will include not only an
urban regeneration plan, but also a business plan and a series of specific
initiatives, long- and short-term, which will provide guidelines for the
next 15 years. In Lincoln, the game is played long.

FT  11 MAY 92 / Survey of Lincolnshire and South Humberside (5): New
employers move in - Success threatens Scunthorpe's development area status
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SCUNTHORPE, AN industrial island set in the agricultural flatlands of South
Humberside, stands at a crossroads, fearful that it may become the victim of
its own success.
The 1980s were times of dramatic change for this town of steelworks and
parkland, transforming it from a community overwhelmingly dependent on the
steel industry to a manufacturing centre with a much more broadly based
spread of activities, ranging from computer hardware to plastics engineering
and food processing.
Development area status, an enterprise zone and European Community aid,
giving access to European Coal and Steel Community loans and the European
Regional Development Fund, have helped Scunthorpe to attract dozens of new
employers during the last decade: more than 40 British companies and 16
multinationals have manufacturing bases in the town.
Unemployment, which, after the traumatic Normanby Park steelworks closure of
the early 1980s, rose to a peak of around 20 per cent, is now, at 9.1 per
cent, just below the national average. But in that case, one might ask, why
should Scunthorpe have top-tier development-area status? That, the town's
borough council fears, is precisely the question government ministers will
be asking when they start their promised review of the UK's assisted-area
map.
The council's answer is that the radical restructuring of the local economy,
for which government assistance has been vital, is still incomplete. It
faces the 1990s without the benefit of enterprise zone concessions: now
fully occupied, the EZ loses its designation next year.
The recession has also bitten; the heady days of the late 1980s, when
Scunthorpe was attracting, in net terms, 40 new businesses a year, have been
followed by leaner times; in 1991 it lost 55 businesses net and around 500
jobs.
There is also an underlying fear that British Steel's Scunthorpe works,
which makes steel sections and plate, is extremely vulnerable, should there
be any further rationalisation in the UK's steelmaking capacity after
Ravenscraig closes in September.
Of the four remaining major BS sites, Scunthorpe, part of the General Steels
business, alone operates from an inland location. In the late 1970s,
steelmaking in Scunthorpe employed around 23,000 people; today British
Steel's payroll is 5,500; about 4,500 more people are estimated by the
council to work as contractors on the BS site in the town. But more steel
jobs are certain to go; BS announced last year that it is to close its
Scunthorpe plate mill, resulting in 600 job losses in 1994.
Despite all this, British Steel remains by far the dominant local employer;
all the newer companies Scunthorpe has attracted employ well below 1,000
people. It also has a subsidiary interest in its former rod mill in the
town, now run by Allied Steel and Wire, and its former bar mill, now owned
by Caparo.
Another cloud on the horizon is the possible knock-on effects on European
assistance should the government abolish Humberside county council. As part
of Humberside, Scunthorpe benefited under the European Community's Yorkshire
and Humberside Steel Areas Integrated Development Operations Programme for
areas hit by steel industry job losses.
Labour-controlled Scunthorpe borough council, however, favours Humberside
county council's abolition; greater autonomy is a powerful promise.
On a brighter note, 'Sunny Scunny' (stand-up comedians have a lot to answer
for) has attracted Pounds 250m ininvestment and around 4,000 jobs to its
250-acre EZ.
Zone status triggered development of new industrial estates, offering rapid
access to the motorway network and Scunthorpe town centre, yet close enough
to the countryside for a pheasant to be spotted last week strutting across a
major access road leading to Foxhills industrial park.
Large employers attracted to the EZ include the expansionist Spring Ram,
HLF, part of Hillsdown Holdings, and Unigate, which developed Europe's
biggest white meat and poultry processing plant at Foxhills.
This plant has just been acquired by Hillsdown, one of a spate of
acquisitions which have brought sudden changes to the ownership of some of
the town's key new businesses. They include the acquisition of Eurolam,
formerly Welsh-owned, by the German company Keinle and Speiss, and of Sooner
Snacks, bought from Borden by Dalgety. This deal has resulted in the
transfer away from Scunthorpe of Sooner Snacks managerial posts.
But Scunthorpe remains the headquarters of several large private companies,
including Clugston, one of the UK's top 50 non-housing building and civil
engineering contractors, which employs 900 people nationally and turns over
Pounds 115m a year. Founded 55 years ago, it pioneered developments in the
use of steel industry slag before diversifying into its present activities.
So far in 1992 it has won contracts worth Pounds 21m.
Among overseas investors in Scunthorpe, the Americans predominate, although
the German presence is increasing. The town has just one Far East
investment, Japanese-owned Citizen, which employs 230 people making computer
printers.
About 36 per cent of Scunthorpe's employment is in manufacturing, well above
the national average. Attracting other sorts of inward investment has proved
more difficult. However, Lloyds Bank has chosen the town for its new
national mortgage-processing centre, employing 120 people.
Now that the EZ is full, the council hopes incoming industry will buy sites
at Lysaghts Enterprise Park, part of the Normanby Park steelworks site. More
than Pounds 2m in government derelict-land grant has been spent here
annually since 1985, but contamination makes for slow progress. Just 40
acres of the 400-acre site has so far been reclaimed. 'We've hardly
started,' observes Mr Fred Kirk, vice-chairman of the council's estates and
industrial development committee.
Mr Kirk, aged 68, and fellow Labour councillor and housing committee
chairman Mr Brian Vessey, 57 are proud of their home town and optimistic
about its future - if development area status is retained. 'We're deemed to
be a successful area,' says Mr Vessey. 'We're worried people in high places
will judge us as not needing help.'

FT  11 MAY 92 / Survey of Lincolnshire and South Humberside (3): Sea gas
will drive new stations - The region will provide power for England in the
21st century
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAURICE SAMUELSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DISTINCTIVE new industrial landmarks are springing up on the flat
countryside between the Wash and the Humber estuary.
They are the chain of gleaming new power stations which will supply much of
England with cheap, environmentally clean electricity well into the 21st
century.
As a result of the new investment, the region could one day rival the
coalfields of Yorkshire and the Midlands as a centre for bulk electricity
generation.
All the new generators there will use natural gas from the North Sea, and
comprise high efficiency combined cycle technology, in which the waste heat
from the primary gas turbines is used to drive auxiliary steam turbines.
The area's first new station, at Killingholme on south Humberside, is due to
start supplying the national grid in the autumn. The 900 MegaWatt plant,
owned by PowerGen, one of the successor companies of the former Central
Electricity Generating Board, will be the biggest non-nuclear power station
to be opened in Britain since the 1970s.
The PowerGen plant is the first of eight large gas-fired power stations
planned in this area and over the next five years. They have a total
capacity of 5,730MW, which, on a warm bank holiday evening, could supply a
high proportion of national demand.
The list includes a second 800MW PowerGen plant at Killingholme, and a 620MW
station on the same site being built by National Power, the bigger of the
non-nuclear companies carved from the CEGB.
The catalyst for the programme was the 1990 privatisation of the electricity
industry which demolished the monolithic CEGB and opened the door to
competitive electricity generation.
Two other factors have attracted a large part of the planned new generating
capacity to the South Humberside and Lincolnshire area:
Its accessibility to the main 'super-grid' lines built to convey electricity
to south-east England from the power stations of the Yorkshire and Trent
Valley coalfields; and
Its terminals for the gasfields of the southern North Sea, which are set to
rival the coalfields as the principal fuel sources for electricity
production.
These twin factors, says Mr Philip Champ, director for power station
development at East Midlands Electricity, are 'the magnet which has made the
region around the Wash the busiest bit of England'.
In addition to those planned at Killingholme, new plants are being built or
planned at Brigg, Keadby, Stallingborough and Sutton Bridge.
The radical nature of the overhaul of the electricity industry is evident in
the exotic mixture of companies behind the new projects. They include the
privatised regional electricity companies (before being privatised, they
were restricted only to distribution of power) and numerous overseas
companies, ranging from combustion equipment suppliers to overseas
utilities.
A Pounds 400m plant at Keadby, South Humberside, is a partnership of
Scottish Hydro-Electric and Norweb, the North West electricity distribution
company.
In the Pounds 400m plant, at Sutton Bridge, Lincolnshire, East Midlands
Electricity is partnered by Electricite de France, the French state utility,
GEC Alsthom (the Anglo-French combustion plant-maker), France's Compagnie
Generale des Eaux, and Iberdrola, an independent Spanish utility.
PowerGen's first Killingholme station is being built by Siemens, the German
electrical giant, and its Kraft Werk Union power generation group.
The biggest single project, the 1,320MW South Humber Bank, at
Stallingborough, is being developed by IVO (Imatran Voima Oy), Finland's
biggest electricity company, which is also the contractor for the Yorkshire
Electricity-led 240MW station at Brigg, a British Sugar refinery site. The
Brigg turbines will be supplied by the Lincoln-based European Gas Turbines,
90 per cent owned by GEC Alsthom and 10 per cent by General Electric of the
US.
Contrary to the ripples which power station projects sometimes cause
elsewhere in Britain, the people of this area have seemed rather unconcerned
at the rate of new development in their midst.
Planning permission for a power station has been available for years at
Stallingborough, proposed site of the South Humber Bank plant. Similarly, at
nearby Killingholme, bought by the CEGB in 1957, there had been successive
plans for stations - both oil and coal - all of which were abandoned for
economic reasons.
But there would be local anger if suggestions resurfaced to use Killingholme
for a different energy-related purpose - in the mid 1980s, it was one of the
places studied by NIREX for the burial of low level nuclear waste. (The idea
was later dropped when the government went for a deep-level burial ground at
Sellafield, Cumbria, but could be re-examined if the Sellafield scheme were
abandoned.)
There is also local anxiety over plans for a big new coal importing terminal
at Immingham. The plans were shelved before the general election, but might
be revived if the new Conservative government gives the electricity industry
the green light to expand coal imports. Local resistance to the new port is
laced with concern about the effect it would have on employment in the
Yorkshire coalfield.
On the other hand, many locals will breathe a deep sigh of relief over the
effect of the smallest power station being built in the area. The 15MW
station, on the site of the former Flixborough chemical works, will be
powered by the manure of nearly 1m chickens a year reared on the Scunthorpe
area's 40 battery farms. The highly pungent 'poultry litter', as it is
clinically called, has been traditionally used to fertilise the area's rich
farmland giving it its recognisable aroma. This is one power station which
should significantly improve, rather than pollute, the atmosphere.

FT  11 MAY 92 / Survey of Lincolnshire and South Humberside (2): A dream
corridor to Europe - Communications - and a bold plan entitled Green Links
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE IS a vision, which makes the periphery the centre, which changes the
shape of European trade flows and which restores rail to the prime position
as a handler of freight. It is a vision called Green Links.
And it is not surprising that Great Grimsby is enthusiastic about it,
because it could provide the town and the expanding neighbouring port of
Immingham with a new role in the next century.
Green Links is an idea for a rail and sea corridor, linking Ireland and the
northern half of England with northern and central Europe. Immingham would
be its key British axis, the last UK stop on the route to Germany, Russia,
Czechoslovakia.
The European Commission is helping to fund studies. Local authorities
throughout Europe are involved. But what the idea lacks in the UK is an
adequate rail network. 'We're agitating to get British Rail to put more
effort into freight. Green Links is aimed at BR as much as at Europe,' said
Mr Roy Bentham, Grimsby's director of leisure and economic development.
As it is, the growth of the Humber deepwater ports, handling around 60m
tonnes of freight a year - Immingham carried more freight in 1991 than in
1990, despite the recession - has been and will continue to be of economic
significance. Although the plans for a new coal terminal foundered in March
on PowerGen's hesitation, Associated British Ports, the owner, plans a new
terminal of a different type, possibly for containers.
Immingham is the major port of the region; indeed, it handles a greater
volume of freight than any other port in the UK. But there are others, not
least that of Grimsby itself, which has won the contract to handle the
export of cars from the new Toyota plant at Burnaston, Derbyshire. Here,
too, a consortium of fish merchants, fishing vessel owners and private dock
operators, working under a licence from Associated British Ports, has a
Pounds 16m plan for the modernisation of the fish docks.
In Lincolnshire, the fortunes of Gainsborough, an inland port, have been in
decline. But, under the new privatised management of AF Budge and John
Sutcliffe, at Boston, on the Wash, work is taking place to allow entrance
for vessels of 4,500 tonnes, instead of the present limit of 3,000 tonnes.
Sutton Bridge was completed at the end of the 1980s as a general cargo port.
Inland links to the ports have improved as the road infrastructure has
gradually improved. The completion of the M180, running along the
Humberside-Lincolnshire border, has been partly instrumental in fostering
the growth of the Humber ports.
The next motorway dream of the local authority planners relates to
north-south communications. It is to have an extension of the M11 from
Cambridgeshire through to Durham. It would pass to the east of Lincoln and
to the west of Market Rasen, but the proposals and the route suggestions now
reside in the Department of Transport awaiting decision. Meanwhile, the main
north-south axis is the A1 and there is a programme to upgrade this to a
three lane motorway.
Other changes are of smaller order. The transformation of the A46 between
Newark and Lincoln should be completed by 1996. Improvements have taken
place to the east-west A17. The A52 between Nottingham and Skegness and the
A158 between Lincoln and Skegness are being upgraded. The Lincolnshire
County Council, following a policy of keeping through traffic out of market
towns and villages, is spending on by-passes - at Swallow and Wainfleet, for
example.
Similarly, the main immediate improvements to the rail network are local.
Lincolnshire County Council and Regional Railways reached agreement in April
on the joint financing of a Pounds 3m package to modernise the line which
cuts across the county, through Gainsborough, Sleaford and Spalding,
starting at Doncaster and terminating at Peterborough. Without such an
agreement the line probably would have been lost. A similar scheme was
worked out for the Grantham-Skegness line ten years ago.
Certainly there are local fears that British Rail may cut out its InterCity
service between Newark and Grimsby, cutting the direct link with London,
although there is a local service of Sprinter trains.
But rail services, especially from the south of the county, are sufficiently
speedy for Lincolnshire to be considered as London commuter territory. This
is because of the electrified east coast main line, which means that the
Grantham-London connection can be travelled in less than an hour. This route
will be increased in importance once the Channel Tunnel opens: Newark is a
designated stop for the direct passenger service to continental Europe.
But there is one point that worried the Confederation of British Industry as
early as 1990. 'The decline in the number of rail freight terminals in
Lincolnshire needs halting,' it said in its document, Towards 2000 in
Lincolnshire. 'Lincolnshire needs easy access to the inland rail freight
terminals to take advantage of the Channel Tunnel,' and hence to ensure
growth into continental markets.
Continental air links are through Humberside Airport in the north, recently
expanded to take more scheduled traffic, and through East Midlands Airport,
to the south in Derbyshire. But for transatlantic flights, passengers still
have to go either to London or Manchester.

Nottingham's pupil - Towards a new university
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LEADERS OF Lincolnshire's public and private sectors are trying to grasp an
opportunity they lost a generation ago, and which probably will not recur
for another generation. It is to set up a new university.
The broad lines of how this will be done are now clear. The detail of the
planning will be evident by the summer.
The university will be based on one or more of the existing colleges of
higher education.
It will start as a university college, under the wing of either Nottingham
Polytechnic or Nottingham University, and then, by the end of the decade or
early in the next, it will strike off as an independent institution.
The origins of this attempt came out of thinking among local business
leaders, and first emerged in a 1990 report of the Confederation of British
Industry.
Business leaders were worried that the intellectual flower of the county
tended to bloom outside. They wanted more young people to stay, to provide
the intellectual stimulus for local business. They wanted the commercial
benefits which can spin out of a strong relationship between industry and
the academic world.
The first thought was that the university would be a private sector venture
and, indeed, there were talks with the University of Buckingham about how it
might be brought about.
But as local interest in the project grew and the public authorities became
involved, the running was taken over by the Lincolnshire County Council.
This resulted in a switch away from an exclusively private sector approach
to an examination of ways in which a university of more orthodox background
might emerge. It became clear that the easiest way was to invite an
institution from the outside to foster the new university.
The examination came at a good time. Not only are student numbers increasing
sharply and expected to do so for the rest of the decade, but the methods of
financing students are changing; so that, instead of travelling hither and
thither to study, they are more likely to stay in the area of their home.
Lincolnshire County Council invited half a dozen interested tertiary
educational institutions to make public presentations of how they would
develop the existing county educational system so that, in a few years, a
new university might emerge.
From these six, Nottingham Polytechnic and Nottingham University have been
chosen for detailed negotiations. At the end of July, one of these two will
be chosen to give birth to the new university.
Largely because it has been made clear there will be no government funding
to help this process, the search will shortly begin for commercial sponsors
of the university.
Both the Nottingham institutions believe it will take around Pounds 30m to
set it up. If there is a shortfall, there will be some resort to the money
markets.
But Lincolnshire County Council itself may provide help: it is one of only
two local authorities in the UK to be free of debt and, at the same time, it
has substantial landholdings.

the way - The region's strength is its diversity. Yet a variety of economic
experience in an area no longer a sleepy outpost has led to competing
interests, the harbinger of conflict. It would be a pity if this were to
deter private-sector investment

<TEXT>
FROM THE Wash to the Humber, from Skegness to Scunthorpe, from Grantham to
Great Grimsby, two decades of change have created an economy of modest
robustness and set off a momentum of development.
This is not to argue that Lincolnshire and South Humberside have avoided the
recession. There have been rationalisations, redundancies and bankruptcies;
and there are areas of great need. But cores of strength do exist, some
traditional, some of more recent vintage, which offer the possibility of
expansion whenever the UK economy recovers.
These areas include: the Humber ports; the chemical and food industries of
Grimsby; the newly diversified Scunthorpe; the engineering of Lincoln; the
farming of Lincolnshire, notwithstanding the external pressures; and the
small-scale industry of the minor towns.
The region's strength - and to this extent Lincolnshire and South Humberside
are a mirror of the wider East Midlands region - is its diversity.
Yet this is also an uneven area. The major urban localities are Lincoln and
Grimsby, the first with a population of about 100,000 if its southern
suburbs outside the strict boundary are included, the second with half as
many people again.
There is a clutch of smaller but significant towns (Scunthorpe, Boston,
Grantham), then those that are smaller still (Louth, Skegness, Spalding,
Stamford, Gainsborough), after which the population spreads out.
Lincolnshire is one of the largest counties, popularly known for the
gentleness of its countryside.
The unevenness is evident not only geographically but also in the impact of
the recession. At 8.8 per cent, the average unemployment rate in
Lincolnshire in the early spring may have been nearly a point lower than the
national average, and during 1991 jobless levels may have risen at half the
national rate. The number of people out of work in Grimsby, the largest town
of South Humberside, may at the end of 1991 have been one percentage point
above the national rate, instead of three percentage points above at the
beginning of the year. But such averages hide sharp disparities.
In Lincolnshire, for example, there is talk of a north-south divide. Indeed,
in the south of the county, although unemployment has risen as the recession
has bitten, the percentage has been, in the case of the Sleaford area, more
than three points below the national average. In the city of Lincoln, the
rate is roughly the same as in the country as a whole. But over on the
coast, in and around Skegness, it climbed towards 19 per cent.
The explanations lie in the varied economic profiles of distinct areas, and
in the range of assistance which is available from central government and in
recent economic history.
Skegness and the coastal belt of Lincolnshire have been excessively
dependent on erratic seaside tourism; its industrial base is weak; it is on
an outer limb of the national communications system. But in farming,
Lincolnshire, designated as an area of rural development, there was
throughout the 1980s considerable building and occupation of small
factories, so that an industrial element has been welded on to the
traditional market activities of the small towns.
At the same time, in the south of the county, there has been private sector
investment as companies, in more prosperous times, sought expansion denied
them in East Anglia and the South of England by labour shortages and higher
land costs. The south, too, has become part of the London commuter belt - a
distant dormitory suburb creating its own demand for services.
Similarly, though for other reasons, development on Humberside has taken
different forms. The loss of Grimsby's deep-sea fishing fleet in the 1970s
found its compensation in the expansion of the chemical, food-processing and
storage industries. In spite of the decision of Findus to withdraw from food
processing, other companies have emerged gradually to offset the loss.
Yet Grimsby's economic diversification has been hindered by the competing
attraction of Scunthorpe. Here, designation as an assisted area and the
existence of an enterprise zone have meant that incoming companies have been
able to tap a range of subsidies unavailable on the coast. Even so, on the
coast, the emergence of Grimsby and of Immingham as the largest bulk cargo
port in the UK has created another pillar of economic resilience.
Such a variety of economic experience has helped to create competing
interests, which are the harbinger of conflict. There is a proposal that all
these communities should be pushed together into one administrative unit.
The Local Government Boundary Commission has recommended that South
Humberside should be absorbed in Lincolnshire.
The recommendation has been frozen while another commission established by
the government decides how, and with what boundaries, a system of unitary
local authorities might be introduced across the country by 1994.
Lincolnshire County Council would be delighted to see its boundaries
extended, and to have a territory running from the Humber to the Wash.
Humberside County Council opposes its own demise and deems the thought
wasteful.
The larger urban areas have no desire to be absorbed into a wider
Lincolnshire. Grimsby wants to be a county borough, as it was a generation
ago, and thinks that the level of service to the public would be lower as
part of Lincolnshire. At the same time, Lincoln city wants to be a unitary
authority in its own right, but with wider boundaries. Within all of this
there is scope for a political battle royal. At the minimum, there will be
some upheaval.
This would be a pity, especially if it diverted the public authorities from
encouraging solutions to deeper-seated problems - for example, the need to
foster training in the frequently low-skilled, low-waged urban areas; to
take education into the more isolated rural areas; to create a new
university and enlarge the industrial-academic nexus.
It would be a pity, too, if political squabbles deterred private-sector
investment. The area is no longer a sleepy outpost of the UK, bypassed by
the communications system. It is more like a bridge between north and south:
close enough to the south to siphon off companies looking for space; but,
with its ports, close enough to the industrial Midlands and north to act as
a conduit to continental Europe.
Lincolnshire, in fact, is likely to increase its population, which is moving
towards 600,000 after having grown by 10 per cent in each decade since the
second world war. Net immigration of 50,000 is expected by the end of the
century. Much of this is likely to come from south-east England, and implies
a steady economic expansion.

South Africa's international rehabilitation provided last week's largest new
cross-border acquisition, writes Brian Bollen. The agreement by Sappi, the
country's largest pulp and paper group, to buy a 90 per cent stake in
Hannover Papier of Germany, the fourth-largest woodfree coated paper
business in Europe, is significant for a number of reasons. Not only is it
Sappi's second major step into the international arena in less than two
years, but it also marks the first time since financial sanctions were
introduced in the mid-1980s that a South African company has used its own
paper to finance a large acquisition. Sappi, advised by Morgan Grenfell,
says the deal, which is subject to various regulatory approvals, enhances
its position as an international forest products group. In future, around
two-thirds of group turnover and profits will be generated by exports and
from non-South African subsidiaries.
The deal also forms an important early part of Sweden's privatisation
programme. Sappi is buying 80 per cent of the stake from Ncb, the Swedish
state-owned loss-making forestry group which put Hannover Papier up for sale
last year. CS First Boston and Handelsbanken Investment Banking advised Ncb.
One company's non-core disposal is another's strategic purchase, as
illustrated by a number of deals. German consumer products company Joh. A.
Benckiser agreed to buy the Coty cosmetics and fragrance business from
Pfizer of the US, which wants to focus on the business strategy of its main
healthcare operations. UK electronics components group Unitech sold its
Rathdown payphones subsidiary to GN Great Nordic Group, the Danish
telecommunications company, as part of its plan to concentrate on its main
business in power supplies, connectors and control products.

FT  11 MAY 92 / State steps in to avert crisis in financial sector: Problems
arising from Sweden's lending in the 1980s
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SWEDEN'S centre-right government may be committed to a sweeping
privatisation programme. Yet the crisis within the banking system has
reached such proportions that the state has been forced to intervene
directly to secure the future of Nordbanken, the country's second largest
commercial bank.
The magnitude of the bank's problems forced the government to step in last
Friday with a pledge of SKr20bn (Pounds 1.89bn) for 'guarantees, loans, or
capital infusions' to restructure the bank and help stabilise the country's
banking system.
Mr Bjorn Wahlstrom, Nordbanken's chairman, underlined the severity of the
bank's plight when he warned that mounting credit losses would have made it
impossible for the bank to achieve the 8 per cent minimum capital adequacy
ratio set out by the Bank for International Settlements.
Nordbanken, in which the state already has a 77.3 per cent stake, is not
alone in its problems. After the deregulation of Nordic financial markets in
the 1980s, and the lifting of controls on lending, the banks scambled for
customers - in some cases paying little attention to their credit
worthiness. The boom and subsequent collapse in Swedish property prices
exacerbated the problem for the banks, which were last year hit by big
credit losses.
Total credit losses for Sweden's financial institutions in 1991 climbed to
SKr48.1bn, nearly three times the 1990 figure. According to Mr Anders
Sahlen, head of the country's independent Bank Supervision Board, further
financial support will be needed to save other banks in difficulties.
The new government has already been forced to help rescue Forsta Sparbanken,
the Swedish savings bank, while Gota, one of the larger commercial banks, is
being taken over by Trygg Hansa SPP in order to bolster confidence in the
bank's financial position.
In the autumn the state had to provide a guarantee for Nordbanken's SKr5.2bn
new share issue. This, though, proved insufficient to meet its needs.
The country's leading private commercial banks - Skandinaviska Enskilda
Banken and Svenska Handelsbanken - believe they are put at a competitive
disadvantage by the state's intervention. Both have been hit by credit
losses but are in stronger positions than others in the sector.
Swedish banking shares dropped sharply last Friday. However, as there is no
bank industry rescue fund such as the one in Norway, bankers accept that the
government had little alternative but to support Nordbanken.
Nordbanken has suffered the heaviest credit losses. Last year it reported a
loss of SKr5.8bn, the biggest in Swedish banking history, following credit
losses of SKr10.5bn. At the end of last month, the bank's board recognised
it had no alternative but to turn to its largest shareholder - the state.
The state will acquire the outstanding 22.7 per cent, including a 12.6 per
cent stake owned by Nobel Industries, the Swedish chemicals group, for SKr21
per share at a cost of SKr2bn. In addition the government will provide
SKr20bn for a restructuring of the bank.
'It is shocking that the taxpayers must pay but we were obliged as a
shareholder to act', admitted Mrs Anne Wibble, the finance minister.
The state-controlled bank has faced strong criticism in the past.
Soon after its creation, when PK Banken agreed to pay SKr5.8bn to acquire
Nordbanken, a regional commercial bank, soaring credit losses led the
Swedish government to dismiss the bank's chief officers and most of the
board.
Last year, the new management implemented rationalisation measures in an
effort to stem the financial deterioration. However, as the Swedish economy
continued to suffer from a recession, these measures proved insufficient and
the situation shows no signs of improvement. Nordbanken forecasts credit
losses of SKr4bn for the whole of 1992.
Under the latest plan, the bank is to be divided into two businesses. A
finance company - Securum - will be created, containing Nordbanken's
outstanding non-performing loans and other assets totalling SKr60bn, as well
as the administration of a large property portfolio.
The other arm, which will be prepared for eventual privatisation, will
consist of Nordbanken's normal commercial banking operations. Credit Suisse
First Boston has been appointed to find a new owner as Mrs Wibble insists
the state wants to privatise the bank as soon as possible.
In the present gloomy market it seems unlikely any large foreign institution
will be interested in acquiring the bank, although there was widespread
speculation earlier this year that it might merge with the Gota group. But
as Gota is being taken over by Trygg Hansa SPP, this solution appears less
likely.
The cost of pulling the whole of the Swedish financial system out of its
present difficulties looks like being a high one for the long-suffering
taxpayer.
The cost to the state of the current rescue operation for Nordbanken is a
hefty sum on top of Sweden's already bulging budget deficit of up to
SKr80bn.
Government officials privately admit that the state's rescue of Nordbanken
could eventually precipitate a comprehensive restructuring of Sweden's
banking sector. However, there still seems a long way to go before Sweden
can boast a stable banking system and further upheavals cannot be ruled out.

FT  11 MAY 92 / CBI optimistic over recovery prospects for small companies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE most optimistic assessment of prospects for smaller companies for two
years emerges from the latest survey of industrial trends published by the
Confederation of British Industry today.
The quarterly industrial trends survey for smaller manufacturing companies
showed that though large companies are expected to continue to shed many
jobs over the next four months, smaller businesses employing fewer than 200
people each will make only a small reduction in employee numbers.
Small companies as well as large have cut jobs recently. But over the next
four months the number of small companies cutting employment is likely to be
almost balanced by those taking on more people, the CBI said.
The survey of small businesses found that:
Twenty-eight per cent said they were more optimistic about the general
business situation, while 18 per cent were less optimistic.
On balance, 10 per cent more businesses expected new orders to increase over
the next four months.
A positive balance of 10 per cent expected an increase in volume output over
the next four months, compared with 13 per cent which had recorded a decline
in the previous four months.
Cost pressures were at their weakest since the smaller companies report was
started in 1980.
Export orders declined in the preceding four months at a slightly faster
rate than experienced by larger manufacturers but they are expected to
increase again over the coming four months.

FT  11 MAY 92 / Global warming pact agreed: UN's draft accord attacked for
lack of a binding timetable on emission cuts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

THE DRAFT of a treaty to curb emissions of greenhouse gases which threaten
to change the earth's climate has been agreed by a 143-country United
Nations committee. The document is likely to become the centrepiece of next
month's Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro.
The text, approved late on Saturday after long and painful negotiations,
should also open the way for the attendance at the summit of US president
George Bush, though only at the cost of a weaker treaty than was originally
sought.
After the agreement, unusually for the UN, delegates broke into prolonged
applause, and some left their places to hug and kiss colleagues. But this
quickly gave way to streams of criticisms of an accord that many called too
weak because it contains no legally binding deadlines. Others denounced it
as a product of the collusion of a few industrial powers.
The Framework Convention on Climate Change will commit states that sign it
at the Earth Summit to limit emissions of gases responsible for raising the
earth's temperature.
But because of US opposition, and against the wishes of EC members,
negotiators failed to agree on clear targets or a timetable to stabilise
concentrations of carbon dioxide, methane and other heat-trapping gases.
Instead, the treaty calls on states to try to hold emissions to 1990 levels
while recognising that a return to 'earlier levels' by the year 2000 would
advance the main objective.
It establishes machinery to review climatic change and advise whether more
stringent measures might be necessary.
Aid for developing countries to meet its goals would be provided through the
Global Environment Facility recently created by the World Bank and other UN
agencies, but no amount is specified.
Hailing the result as a 'very strong' agreement, Mr Robert Reinstein, chief
US delegate, rejected charges of US foot-dragging and compared the American
record favourably with that of other nations. 'Europe is frankly in many
areas not quite as advanced as the US has been,' he said, adding that the
Europeans' stance reminded him of 'our idealism of the 1970s on the
environment'. Japan also had not been known as a 'great protector of the
environment'.
The first sour note after adoption of the treaty was sounded by Malaysia,
which said it was 'fundamentally flawed' and Malaysia could not participate
in any resolution emanating from it.
Environmental groups offered mixed reviews. The World Wide Fund for Nature's
Mr Richard Benedick termed it 'a very important first step in a process that
is going to take us out of fossil fuels'. But Mr Paul Hohen of Greenpeace
International blamed Mr Bush for a meaningless convention that was 'the most
expensive ticket to Rio in history'.

FT  11 MAY 92 / Row over US veto may delay Russia's IFC deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A ROW over the US's voting power in the International Finance Corp (IFC),
the World Bank affiliate charged with promoting private sector investment in
developing countries, threatens to delay further membership of the
organisation by Russia and the other former Soviet republics.
IFC board members have agreed in principle to approve the membership of the
republics. They have also resolved an earlier problem by agreeing to
recommend to their governments a selective capital increase to be subscribed
to by the republics.
But a meeting to conclude the membership package broke up abruptly last week
over a proposal to change the IFC's rules to preserve the US's de facto veto
over certain decisions.
Some senior officials now worry that the wrangling could lead to damaging
delays in the Washington-based organisation's efforts to start work in
Russia and the other republics.
The new shares to be issued to the republics would dilute the US's stake in
the IFC below its current 24.08 per cent level, although the exact dilution
will depend on whether Switzerland votes to join the corporation, along with
the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, in a referendum on May
17.
The US stake is in practice enough to block decisions such as capital
increases, which require approval from members holding 75 per cent of the
voting shares, or changes to the corporation's articles, which need 80 per
cent approval.
Most member countries appear ready to agree to preserve the US veto by
increasing the number of votes required - probably to 80 per cent for
capital increases and 85 per cent for changes to the articles. There seems
little enthusiasm for the rule change, but it is seen as the price of
winning speedy US acceptance of the Russian membership package.
France and some Nordic countries, however, have criticised the proposal,
both on the principle of preserving a US veto and on the grounds that the
rule change would require parliamentary approval from many IFC member
countries. This could delay still further the entry of the republics.
One suggestion for bringing Russia and its fellow republics quickly into the
IFC fold is for each republic to take only a single, symbolic share, until
wrangling over the details of the capital increase has been concluded.
This idea is supported by Russia and its sponsor in the IFC, the UK, as well
as Ukraine. But it has angered many smaller IFC member countries, which have
had to pay for their stakes in the corporation, but have yet to receive any
IFC financing.

FT  11 MAY 92 / Employment Training faces review as criticism mounts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A COMPREHENSIVE review of Employment Training, the government's
controversial Pounds 800m scheme for the long-term unemployed, is to be
launched shortly by the Department of Employment.
The investigation follows concern both within the department and among
Training and Enterprise Councils (Tecs), which administer ET, over the
effectiveness of the programme in achieving qualifications and jobs for
participants. Three months after leaving the scheme, most trainees are
unemployed.
Set up in 1988, ET was criticised by Mr David Mellor, the former Treasury
chief secretary, in last year's round of public expenditure negotiations.
The real value of ET's budget fell slightly.
ET, along with Youth Training and other aspects of the department's training
budget, is likely to come under renewed pressure in this year's
negotiations. Mrs Gillian Shephard, the employment secretary, said in a
recent letter to chairmen of Tecs that she wanted to be in a position to
'demonstrate the effectiveness and real value for money of what we do in
order to defend our performance and our budgets' in the public expenditure
negotiations. The quality of ET has been consistently criticised by Tecs,
many of which want to experiment with different approaches, including
extending training vouchers to the adult unemployed.
Some Tecs want shorter but higher quality training. The Department of
Employment would need to persuade the Treasury that such a move would lead
to more job placements. Such a shift would be politically sensitive because
fewer people on ET would have an impact on unemployment figures.
Critics of ET have claimed that ET as it stands is an initiative designed to
get people off the unemployment register.
The most recent figures showed that slightly less than half of the 126,787
trainees completed the training agreed with their provider. The majority did
not obtain a qualification.

FT  11 MAY 92 / The Lex Column: Oil sector
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Given the problems dogging the oil industry lately, it is worth considering
the wider implications if crude prices stay weak in the long run. After all,
it is conceivable that the higher real prices of the 1970s which made North
Sea development possible were a break in a longer pattern of stability. The
late 1980s in particular may be characterised as a period of over-investment
by oil companies on the false premise that prices would rise again. The flaw
in the logic was that the more companies invested on the basis of higher
prices, the less likely higher prices became.
In theory, sustained low prices might make new investment uneconomic, in
which case companies might have no choice but to shrink. In practice, the
outlook is not quite as bleak as that. Oil at Dollars 18 per barrel probably
does allow an acceptable rate of return on most of the projects actually
being contemplated. It is certainly a more appropriate investment benchmark,
forcing the industry to re-examine its expenditure on new wells or rivals'
assets.
The real problem is not so much cheap oil as the financial legacy of the
late 1980s. Past investments must still be paid for, whether or not they are
making the expected returns. The continuing squeeze on cash flow is
hampering the industry's ability to fund new projects. This dilemma is
particularly acute for the independent exploration companies. Unless they
are lucky enough to find oil cheaply, they have no prospect of raising the
money without which they cannot explore. Nor are their shares yet so cheap
that they represent an affordable investment for other players in the
sector. In that kind of tussle, there seems little reason for the portfolio
investor to get involved.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
After its latest round of talks with the banks, Olympia &amp; York's future
remains unpredictable. The hypothesis of the company's collapse, however,
may not be as alarming as some in the property world assume. Conventional
wisdom is that it would be an unmitigated disaster, further swelling the
oversupply of deeply discounted high-quality office space in the City and
West End of London. But it could be that the very remoteness which is
Docklands' basic problem limits its influence on the centre. Indeed, the
City could eventually benefit if the sceptics are finally proved right: that
even with its ill-fated transport system in place, Docklands will never be
more than a classier version of Croydon.
In the shorter term, a collapse might also mean that some tenants who have
moved or are moving to Docklands could wriggle out of their contractual
obligations. Moreover, the huge financial inducements which were used to
bring others to Docklands would no longer be available.
Granted, the effect on the banks could have more serious implications for
the property sector. Lenders have thus far shown a remarkably united front,
as in recent rescues at Mountleigh, Rosehaugh and Speyhawk. The reason -
that they cannot afford to do otherwise - is best illustrated by the
calculation that the cost of fully providing for 20-25 per cent of the UK
clearers' Pounds 17bn of property exposure is equivalent to three years'
profits. There is no knowing the actual figure they have set aside, but one
outside guess is that it is less than half what might be considered prudent.
The risk is that the credit squeeze now facing UK property developers could
turn into a veritable credit crunch. But the banks may well have built the
demise of O&amp;Y into their calculations already, as has the market for
property shares.

Last week's announcement that the National Grid is applying for a licence to
supply telephone services will not have worried BT or Mercury unduly. Groups
such as the electricity and water companies and British Rail were always
likely to take advantage of their national infrastructures and special
privileges. By law, they can no longer keep those privileges to themselves.
But their main problem will be to find the huge sums required if they are to
compete. In the year to last March, BT invested Pounds 2.4bn. In its last
financial year, Mercury invested Pounds 500m. It is hard to envisage the
National Grid playing in that league for years to come.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Shrewd players of Monopoly, the board game for would-be property punters,
will be aware that London railway stations can be extraordinarily valuable
assets. Thanks to the government's renewed determination to hand over large
chunks of British Rail to the private sector - as outlined in last week's
Queen's Speech - it looks as though businessmen will be able to try the
real-life version.
As with other privatisations - or creeping denationalisations as this one is
probably better described - there are implications for the public finances,
as well as for those companies which may care to get involved. Ministers
naturally dismiss the idea that a latter-day Beeching plan is in the offing.
But at the very least, a rethink about the costs, value, and size of the
network is now assured.
In particular, the process will expose cross-subsidies in the system now
hidden by the provision to BR of a single block grant. Take BR's freight
business, for example, which mostly loses money because of fierce
competition from road hauliers, but which benefits from paying a relatively
small charge for access to the track. In theory, InterCity services are all
pitted against road and air alternatives. In practice, profits from near
monopoly positions on medium-haul routes like London to Birmingham help prop
up other parts of the service. Cash disposals are clearly part of the
government's plan. But in view of its commitment to maintaining the level of
services, the proceeds from selling off the lucrative bits like coal
transport will in part be offset by the need to replace the cross-subsidy
which these activities provide.
Against that, the hope is that subsidies will fall as operators compete for
the unprofitable services. But it might be a mistake to think that the
government is mainly in this one for the money. Even the stations may not be
as juicy as they appear on the Monopoly board. Complications include
planning constraints - Paddington, for example, is a listed building - while
developers will surely be obliged to retain the working bits like platforms
and concourses, under BR supervision.

FT  11 MAY 92 / Leading Article: Reform of the pension funds
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE MAXWELL scandals have left millions of members of occupational pension
schemes wondering just how safe their pensions are, and many thousands
facing actual poverty. It was a theme which dominated the annual conference
of the National Association of Pension Funds last week.
Battles may lie ahead. A survey by the 100 Group of finance directors
suggested that companies will fight for the right to continue to claw back
at least part of scheme surpluses for their benefit.
Some would say that it is time to draw up a radical agenda. Already the role
of occupational schemes has shrunk: NAPF member schemes cover no more than
7m employees, against the more than 4m who have started personal pension
plans within the past few years. Now that scheme membership is voluntary
many pensions managers are disappointed in their ability to attract the
support of new recruits.
Perhaps the fraudulent disappearance of money will prove a very rare
phenomenon (though the Maxwell case is unique only in its size) but millions
of scheme members regularly - if undramatically - lose out through poor
transfer values and the reluctance to protect benefits against inflation.
Indeed, the current phenomena of scheme surpluses and widespread company
contribution holidays can be said to relate very largely to the failure to
maintain benefits in real terms. Many employees might be better off with a
system of low-cost company-sponsored personal pension plans which could be
freely transferred from one employment to another.
Deep pool
But the well-entrenched network of occupational schemes should not be
dismantled lightly. With some Pounds 300bn of assets they represent an
enormous and stable pool of long-term savings, the envy of some countries
which are overdependent on save-as-you-go pensions systems threatened by
adverse demographic trends.
Nevertheless, it is right that the state should intervene to draw up some
tighter rules. Occupational pension schemes are not simply exercises in
corporate charity and paternalism, they are aspects of employee benefit
strategy which exploit generous tax reliefs. In exchange, the government is
entitled to be confident that, at the very least, it will not be faced with
huge compensation demands. More generally, it needs to be confident that
schemes are run fairly.
A first priority is to provide for the safe custody of funds. Some kind of
insurance or compensation scheme must also be developed in case things still
go wrong. These may prove costly measures, but they cannot now be avoided.
Trustees' powers
Second, pension fund trustees must be given broader powers and
responsibilities to ensure fair treatment of beneficiaries. At present, they
can do little more than apply often inequitable rules laid down by the
employers. Already the government has been forced to legislate to ensure
fairer transfer terms and protection against inflation, but more is
required.
Third, there is the controversial matter of the ownership of so-called
surpluses. These have arisen basically because during the 1980s dividends
rose faster than employee earnings, but this is no longer true. During the
1970s, many schemes actually went into substantial deficit, and companies
argue that if they are expected to top schemes up in hard times they must
also be permitted to benefit at least indirectly from surpluses when they
occur, otherwise schemes will be allowed to become chronically underfunded.
However, it might be possible to approach this problem by laying down
minimum funding standards, which will in any case be required if scheme
benefits are to be insured.
By moving carefully in these directions it ought to be possible to preserve
the bulk of the occupational pensions sector while improving the security of
members. The balance of advantage must to some degree shift from final
salary schemes towards money purchase arrangements which impose an extra
investment risk upon the scheme members but avoid the problems of surpluses
and inequitable distribution of benefits. They are, indeed, only one step
removed from personal plans. Recent events have made fundamental reform
inevitable as well as desirable.

FT  11 MAY 92 / Arts: Tippett's Fifth Quartet - Music
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW CLEMENTS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Lindsay Quartet's recital on Saturday was originally planned to launch
the Sheffield Chamber Music Festival for 1992. But the group's leader Peter
Cropper was taken seriously ill several months ago, and the bulk of the
festival (focusing on British works) has had to be postponed until next
year. Happily, though, Cropper's recovery allowed the first concert at least
to take place, and with it the first performance of Michael Tippett's Fifth
Quartet, commissioned by the Lindsay for the occasion.
The whole programme had been shaped around the premiere. It was introduced
by a Fanfare to welcome Sir Michael Tippett by Christopher Brown, 87 bars
woven out of Tippettian fragments and quotations from Purcell, together with
three of Purcell's string fantasias, played with exquisite poise and
intensity. Then there were two fascinating revivals of quartets by Tippett's
teachers at the Royal College of Music during the 1930s - R. O. Morris's
three Canzoni ricertati were dry, over long exercises in imitative
counterpoint (Tippett observed after the performance that perhaps he should
have given Morris some lessons) but Charles Wood's Third String Quartet was
a likeable piece of late romanticism, with firm feet in the quartet language
of Brahms and Dvorak, and a sweet tooth for morsels of Irish folk song.
The Lindsay played both magnificently, with a confidence and grasp of idiom
remarkable for works so far outside the regular repertory. Their playing of
the Tippett too was astonishingly assured; its considerable problems of
balance and co-ordination seemed perfectly mastered. The new quartet is cast
in two movements, the first a sonata-form mosaic of fast and lyrical
sections, the second a slow meditation interrupted by fantasia-like dances.
                         *      *      *
There are thematic links with Tippett's major scores of the 1980s - Geraint
Lewis's programme note pointed out connections with material from The Mask
of Time and New Year - but its roots seem to stretch back much farther into
Tippett's writing for strings. The first movement seemed the less convincing
of the two, short on distinctive ideas and perhaps over-extending its
material. But in the second the juxtaposition of rapt untethered lyricism in
the first violin's high-lying, unaccompanied rhapsodies with the crystalline
rhythmic shapes of the Purcell-inspired dances conjures up memories of
Tippett's Corelli Fantasia from the mid-1950s, if without ever quite
attaining that work's level of profoundity or transcendency.
On repeated hearings too the first movement may well gain more coherence and
identity. As Tippett's debt to Beethoven in his quartet writing becomes ever
clearer (the second movement here is based on the great Adagio of Op. 132)
so the full implications of his abstract designs become more elusive. The
seemingly innocuous intent of many of the components should not be taken at
face value. His dramatic writing has become more increasingly emblematic;
perhaps his instrumental writing has acquired the powers of suggestion and
ambiguity lacking there.

FT  11 MAY 92 / Arts: Zaide - Opera
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW CLEMENTS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Zaide is not really an opera by Mozart at all, finished or unfinished, but
the title bestowed by a Viennese publisher on the collection of 15 numbers
written to texts by Johann Andreas Schachtner in Salzburg in 1779-80. There
is no surviving dialogue or scenario to connect up Mozart's sequence of
arias and ensembles, and attempts to associate the two-act plan with any
pre-existing Singspiel plots set like Zaide in a Turkish harem have all
failed. It remains an intriguing torso with decent though largely
unremarkable music. The two short melodramas are the most interesting
feature of the score, suggesting Mozart may have been trying them out as an
alternative to dialogue or recitative and perhaps that he abandoned the
project because he was dissatisfied with the result.
                         *      *      *
The new City of Birmingham Touring Opera Zaide, directed by Graham Vick, is
being given in the version that the late Italo Calvino made for the Musica
nel'Chiostro Festival at Batignano in 1981. The set pieces are delivered in
their original German, and around them a modern-day narrator (using William
Weaver's limpid English translation) elaborates a plot, setting up the
characters, and leading them along the story line implied by the original
texts. Only then does Calvino begin to tease and pick at the threads of the
narrative, opening out its possibilities. The action is stopped, reversed
and run through again from a new perspective, finding the right dramatic
context for each number, until there is a maze of pathways and the final
quartet can settle in its own comfortable niche.
Vick directed the Batignano premiere (which was brought to the Old Vic for
three performances later the same year). His new staging is played out on a
single set by Paul Brown which faithfully reproduces the clutter of the
narrator's shabby room. It is unfussy without extraneous detail; everything
is focused upon Calvino's dramatic framing and sleights of hand, and the
scrupulous presentation of Mozart's music. That is conducted by Simon Halsey
with a period band, and could have been delivered with more energy and
panache. The singing, though, is generally first-rate: Jane Leslie Mackenzie
seizes upon Zaide's arias with clean, confident attack; Iain Paton is
forthright in the music for Gomatz. There is a suitably blustering Soliman
from Anthony Roden, eye-rolling Osmin from Peter Snipp, and cloudy-toned
Allazim from Mark Holland.
James Maxwell is the narrator, a sorcerer's apprentice who only just keeps
control of his creations; he makes the most of the moments when Calvino's
text takes flight and evokes the orientalism of the harem in luminous
imagery. Then this Zaide seems most perfectly poised ' between the enigmatic
classicism of Mozart's fragment and the delicate labyrinths of this most
elegant of 20th-century writers.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN'S first tourist attraction where customers will have to pass a
breathalyser test before they can join in some of the fun opens in Liverpool
tomorrow.
After eight years of controversy, the site of the 1984 Liverpool
International Garden Festival will reopen in a third attempt to bring it
back into permanent use. A central feature will be an indoor, high-tech,
army-style assault course of slides, rope bridges and obstacles which only
the sober will be allowed to use.
There will be no machines or power-driven rides, as in a conventional theme
park. Gravity and muscle, combined with hair-raising 60ft drops down helical
tubes a metre in diameter will provide the thrills. The organisers promise
safety and heavily cushioned landings, but the first-aid room will
nevertheless be staffed with qualified nurses. The facilities will also be
available for private hire by companies for executive team-building or for
entertaining customers. Mirror mazes and laser guns for corporate shoot-outs
will come with the package.
The site's operator is Tomorrow's Leisure, the Newcastle-based company
quoted on the unlisted securities market. It is run by Mr John Sanderson,
who founded and still owns two thirds of Norstead, a Tyneside engineering
group employing 800 people. The Liverpool venture has created 240 permanent
jobs.
Tomorrow's Leisure has taken a 125-year lease on the core 88 acres of the
festival site and invested Pounds 8m in turning the two-acre, futuristic
Festival Hall into a games complex including a 20-lane bowling alley, a
roller-skating rink, restaurants and bars.
Merseyside Development Corporation has provided Pounds 2.5m and the
Department of Trade and Industry Pounds 1m.
Mr Sanderson says that concentrating activities indoors in the Festival Hall
will make it independent of weather and enable the centre to open every day
of the year except Christmas Day.

FT  11 MAY 92 / BBC faces sponsorship accusation: Concern over tobacco
promotion
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARY MEAD, Marketing Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BBC was accused yesterday of providing free advertising for tobacco
companies through its coverage of of sporting events supported by
tobacco-related sponsorship.
The government-funded Health Education Authority suggested that BBC viewers
of sporting events last year could have watched 'tobacco company or brand
images for up to 25 minutes of every hour of transmission' - equivalent to
as many as 50 30-second tobacco advertisements an hour.
The report suggests that tobacco companies have discovered an attractive
commercial deal: whereas paid-for television advertising could cost some
Pounds 1 1/2 m an hour, tobacco-sponsored televised sport amounts to some
300 hours annually on the BBC, with just Pounds 5m spent by the companies on
sponsoring events.
Cigarette advertising on television was banned in the UK in 1965. That ban
was extended to include all tobacco advertising last October when the
government acted on the 1989 EC broadcasting directive.
The EC council of health ministers is due to meet soon to consider a draft
directive to ban all forms of tobacco advertising.
The authority's report highlights the means by which tobacco sponsors spread
their message on BBC broadcasts.
Placing tobacco company and brand names of boards in key positions.
Putting company logos on sport participants.
Visual and verbal references to sponsors in commentaries and studio
event-title shots.
Echoing the company colours and brand names in other features of the event,
such as umbrellas or refreshment stands.
The BBC said that its policy on sponsorship was subject to 'very strict
guidelines', particularly in the case of events sponsored by tobacco
companies. The guidelines went beyond the voluntary code agreed by the
government and the Tobacco Advisory Council, which lays down the number of
shots of posters, logos and other promotional items.
The BBC said the authority's recommendation that it should cease covering
tobacco-sponsored events would 'conflict with our obligations to our
licence-payers'.

FT  11 MAY 92 / Dish sales down on year and month: FT Satellite Monitor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARY MEAD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SATELLITE dish sales reached 71,000 last month compared with 96,000 in April
last year, according to the latest FT Satellite Monitor. The figure was down
from March - when the cricket world cup was shown - and 94,000 dishes were
sold.
April's installations bring the number of satellite dishes in the UK to
2.443m, which means they have been installed in 10.9 per cent of homes.
According to Continental Research, which produces the Monitor, intentions to
install have also dropped. That is attributed to the onset of spring
weather, which leads people to think more of outdoor activities as a source
of spending.
In March 2.2m households without dishes said they intended to install them;
the figure dropped to just over 2m in April.
The Monitor estimates total market potential - those already with dishes and
those intending to install - is now 4.5m, or one in five of all British
households. That figure is up from 3.5m a year ago.
The latest Broadcasters' Audience Research Board figures show that for the
last week of April the fall in share of viewing taken by Sky Sports  - part
of BSkyB in which Pearson, owner of the Financial Times has a stake - has
been taken up mainly by the BBC rather than other satellite channels.

FT  11 MAY 92 / ITN chief seeks speedy reshaping of ownership
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR BOB PHILLIS, chief exec-utive of Independent Television News, has begun
the restructuring of his organisation and hopes to sign up the first new
shareholder before the end of this year.
The government decided that in future 51 per cent of ITN, at present a
wholly owned subsidiary of the ITV companies, should be held by non-ITV
companies. The end of 1994 has been set as the deadline for completing that
process.
Mr Phillis is keen to move much more quickly to remove uncertainty and also
because several ITV companies are interested in selling their stakes. Thames
Television, which lost its franchise, is expected to reduce its 22 per cent
stake in ITN to 20 per cent, but two other losers - TVS with 8 per cent and
Television South West with 2 per cent  - are expected to sell. Some of the
smaller ITV companies may also decide to follow. The tiny Channel TV, for
example, owns only 0.2 per cent of ITN.
London Weekend Television, in spite of retaining its franchise, is believed
to be interested in selling its ITN stake.
Mr Phillis has been talking to US television companies such as ABC, CBS and
Mr Ted Turner's CNN, and the first outside buyer might come from the US
industry. The purchase of a 20 per cent stake by a US broadcaster would also
help to put a value on an organisation that has been making the painful
transition from cost centre to profit centre.
Mr Michael Green's Carlton Television, which ousted Thames for the London
weekday franchise, has also written to ITN expressing interest in acquiring
a stake.
The restructuring is likely to involve a mixture of putting together willing
buyers and sellers, and raising capital.
If a workable structure emerges in which ITV companies still have a
majority, only then is Mr Phillis likely to ask Mr David Mellor, the
national heritage secretary, to consider removing the 51 per cent outside
shareholder rule.

FT  11 MAY 92 / Leaseholders to profit from property reform: Extensive
changes in land law
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE right of leaseholders to buy the freehold of their property, which was
heralded in the Queen's Speech last week, is one of the most radical and
controversial changes to land law in England and Wales this century.
The legislation, which is likely to become law by summer next year, is 'an
essential part of our policy on extending home ownership', according to Sir
George Young, the housing minister.
The proposals, which will tackle the difficulties of bad management and
leases which have a only short time to run, have been welcomed by consumer
groups and building societies.
The losers are traditional landowners who resent being forced to sell. 'It
is a massive infringement of democratic principles,' says Mr Jeremy Newsum,
chief executive of the Grosvenor Estate, which owns much of London's Mayfair
and Belgravia.
One MP compared it to the dissolution of the monasteries, in its arbitrary
transfer of property from one section of the community to another.
How many properties are affected? There are an estimated 1.5m leaseholders
in the UK, concentrated in London and towns on the south coast.
Why is the legislation being introduced? First, it will tackle bad
management of flats as owners will be able to get rid of landlords who fall
short of their responsibilities. Second, it will help in cases where leases
have less than 70 years to run, which are not mortgageable and so are often
unsellable at present.
How much will it cost to buy a freehold? The price will be the market price
plus an additional sum to account for the 'marriage value' released by
merging the freehold and leasehold interests. The landlord's costs and loss
of development rights or effect on the value of other land owned will also
be taken into account. If agreement cannot be reached, the courts will
decide. Building societies may be willing to provide loans to cover the cost
of buying a freehold.
Who qualifies? At least two thirds of the long-lease holders must agree to
purchase the freehold.
What happens to those who do not want to buy their flats when a block is
enfranchised? The buyers will be the joint freeholders for any tenants or
leaseholders who do not participate.
Which flats will not qualify under the legislation? Exemptions include
properties with leases that were originally granted for less than 21 years,
properties with a substantial annual rent, properties with fewer than two
flats, properties where fewer than two thirds of the flats are let on long
leases, properties where more than 10 per cent of the floorspace is used for
non-residential purposes, properties owned by the Crown or charitable trust
housing already let at a discount. Exemptions also cover converted buildings
with four or fewer flats, where the landowner lives in the house for at
least a year. Flat owners in blocks that do not qualify will have the right
to extend their leases at market price.
What about houses? The 1967 Leasehold Reform Act will be amended to remove
the upper limits on rateable values. The houses affected would be those
whose rateable values exceed Pounds 1,500 in London and Pounds 750
elsewhere; or whose annual rental equivalent exceeds Pounds 25,000, when
leases were granted after April 1 1990.
Will the value of property be enhanced? The It will clearly help properties
with short leases that are now virtually unsaleable. In the long term,
though, properties might fall in value if the buildings deteriorate as a
result of lack of agreement between flat owners.
What are the Commonhold proposals? Quite separately from the enfranchisement
proposals, the government is working on a new form of tenure that might
replace the freeholder/leaseholder structure. Each commonholder owns his or
her unit outright, together with a share in the common parts.
How should a tenant go about enfranchisement? The first, optional step is to
serve a notice on the landlord to find out whether the building qualifies
for enfranchisement and how much it will cost. The next step is to serve a
Purchase Notice on the freeholder and to form a company to own the freehold.
The landlord then serves a counter notice, disputing the terms, if
necessary. If negotiations fail or if one of the parties delays completion
by more than two months after agreement, either party has the right to go to
court.
A booklet on enfranchisement is available from Room N11/11, Department of
the Environment, 2 Marsham Street, London SW1 3EB.

FT  11 MAY 92 / Patten sees little chance of being PM
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MR CHRIS PATTEN, who will become governor of Hong Kong in July, said
yesterday that he was unlikely to become prime minister.
'Given that John Major and I are more or less the same age - and given that
he has proved such an outstandingly successful political leader - he will go
on for a very long time,' he said on TV-am. 'Anyone of my generation is very
unlikely to be prime minister.'
He hoped he would not be 'entirely over the hill' in 1997 when Hong Kong was
handed over to China. He will then be 52.
Mr Patten added that in Hong Kong he might abandon the governor's ceremonial
dress, which is seen by some people as an emblem of colonialism. 'It is
perfectly possible to maintain the authority and dignity of the office
through the way you carry it out,' he said.
He said he intended to work to ensure that the joint declaration about Hong
Kong by the UK and China, in which a degree of democracy and a free-market
economy are guaranteed, was put into effect.
'What China is talking about is pretty unique - one country with two
different systems operating within it,' he said. 'The Chinese want to see it
work as successfully as we do and the people of Hong Kong do.'
Mr Patten, outgoing Conservative party chairman and a former environment
secretary, was MP for Bath from 1979 until last month's general election,
when he lost the seat to the Liberal Democrats.

FT  11 MAY 92 / Shake-up planned for laws on secrecy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A REVIEW of secrecy laws, which might eventually open to public scrutiny
inspectors' reports on health and safety, drug and other companies, will be
set today as the next extension of the government's Citizen's Charter
programme.
Mr William Waldegrave, the cabinet minister responsible for seeing the
charter into action, will tell MPs that he sees a greater openness by
officials as an essential part of moves towards reducing central
government's role.
In accordance with the Tory election manifesto, he wants slimmer Whitehall
departments acting as policymakers and representing consumers, with other
government operations transferred increasingly to executive agencies.
Greater access to information would increase the power of consumers, he will
say in the Commons debate on last week's Queen's Speech.
An interdepartmental committee, chaired by Mr Andrew Wettnall, a senior
civil servant from the Cabinet Office, has been set up to trawl government
departments for areas where secrecy restrictions can be lifted. Mr
Waldegrave hopes legislation will be introduced next year.
However, ministers have disappointed consumer groups and opposition
politicians by ruling out a Freedom of Information Bill. Ministers argue
that such a bill would not guarantee that existing restrictions were lifted.
No decisions have been taken about what secrecy laws may be repealed but Mr
Waldegrave is believed to have told officials that he wants to consider all
sources of information received by the government to see whether more could
be released. That could include reports of health and safety inspectors and
possibly even by company inspectors.
Speaking yesterday on BBC Radio, Mr Waldegrave said he wanted to 'root out'
the 'Yes, Minister' culture of Whitehall, where it was assumed that members
of the public were unable to interpret information correctly.
'The answer from the bureaucracy is always, 'Don't give them the
information, they will misinterpret it',' he said. 'That must be the wrong
way around. Give out the information - and then explain what it means.'

FT  11 MAY 92 / Fowler pledges big review of Tory machine
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIR NORMAN FOWLER, who takes over as Conservative party chairman today,
yesterday promised a 'fundamental review of the party's organisation and
structure'.
'We need to make sure that we are as efficient and effective as possible,'
he explained. 'My aim is to make this party the best political organisation
in Europe.'
He indicated that he might look favourably at increasing democracy in the
Conservative machine. There is pressure in the party for elections for
senior posts - including Sir Norman's - at Central Office. At present,
holders of such posts are chosen by the prime minister. Sir Norman also
indicated that he might publish fuller party accounts. The Sutton Coldfield
MP's responsibilities will include depleted party finances, boosting the
chances for women to become candidates in Commons and council elections, and
preparing for the 1994 elections to the European parliament.
Central Office is an unwieldy and costly machine that Sir Norman sees as
ripe for change. The general election campaign was lacklustre, even if the
result was a Tory win. Sir Norman, as the prime minister's 'minder' during
the campaign, saw at first hand the lack of cohesion - and Mr Major's
frustration. Unlike many previous party chairmen, Sir Norman will not join
the cabinet. He could have insisted on a cabinet post in the new government,
but says the extra responsibility would have stopped him getting out into
the country.
There will be staff cuts and changes at Central Office under his leadership.
He wants organisation to be improved in marginal seats and the central party
machine to be geared to giving the service expected by local activists.
The party is in the red. Central Office insiders say the election was
financed by a flurry of donations during the campaign and that the deficit
has not grown. The party's advertising budget for the general election,
believed to have been about Pounds 4.5m, was no more than half the amount
spent in the 1987 campaign. Sir Norman, a Tory knight of middle England,
will have to guard against defeats in by-elections. There were some
spectacular ones in the last parliament, such as the one at Eastbourne in
October 1990. With the government's majority now cut to 21, losses in this
parliament will be more costly.
When a member of Mrs Margaret Thatcher's government, Sir Norman acquired a
reputation for fighting Westminster battles with verve while shielding his
back.
He was loyal to Mrs Thatcher and successfully avoided much of the
controversy in his six years as social services secretary that plagued his
successors. Only subsequently was the department split into social security
and health. Under Mr John Major he helped to quell Tory backbenchers'
threats to the Maastricht Treaty by standing, successfully, for the post of
chairman of the party's backbench Europe committee.
In January 1990 Sir Norman, an Essex-born grammar school boy, resigned as
Mrs Thatcher's employment secretary, saying he wanted to spend more time
with his family. Now aged 54, he wants to return to the political fray.
Sir Norman explained that his children were older. 'I have almost to make
appointments with them', he added.
MR JOHN MAJOR has appointed three backbenchers to senior posts in the
Conservative party. Mr Gerry Malone, who won Winchester in the general
election, is to be a deputy chairman. Mr Tim Smith, MP for Beaconsfield, is
to be party vice-chairman in charge of finances and fund-raising. Mr Andrew
Mitchell, MP for Gedling, will be vice-chairman responsible for candidate
selection.

FT  11 MAY 92 / Cash crisis at charity may hit trust hospital
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE, Social Affairs Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONE OF the new self-governing trust hospitals faces financial loss if
attempts this week to rescue the charity Action and Research into Multiple
Sclerosis (Arms) fail.
The charity's national research centre is based at the Central Middlesex
hospital, west London, which became a trust last year.
Arms's 13 full and part-time research centre staff are included on the
Central Middlesex payroll, with the charity then reimbursing the hospital.
Central Middlesex managers estimate that they are owed about Pounds 500,000
by Arms, which is trying to secure its financial base.
The collapse of Arms would leave several hundred long-term patients of the
research centre without an alternative source of treatment. 'There is a
paramount need for bridging finance so that the Arms clinical work can
continue for a reasonable period while the future needs of patients are
assessed,' said Mr Andy Black, Central Middlesex chief executive. 'We can't
just put a sign up saying that the unit is closed.'
Mr John Simkins, chief executive of Arms, said attempts were still being
made to secure the charity's financial position.
It is likely to become clear later this week whether Arms, which has funded
research into multiple sclerosis and has operated therapy centres since
1974, will survive. Its regional therapy centres are managed as subsidiaries
and would be likely to continue even if the national charity did not.
The pressures behind Arms's financial difficulties mirror those of many
charities in a climate of recession and increasing competition for funds.
Arms's voluntary workers and staff blame the charity's difficulties on three
main factors. They say that:
The recession, which has proved longer and deeper than many charity
fund-raising managers expected, is reducing contributions. 'Telethons' and
other big national appeals are distorting patterns of giving and making it
more difficult for smaller charities to maintain their share of donations.
Charities face growing competition for funds from self-governing hospitals,
universities and other public institutions.
Arms has this year been running a Football Against MS promotion, with
Nationwide Anglia Building Society as its leading sponsor. Nationwide
contributed Pounds 300,000 to the project - Pounds 150,000 as a donation and
the other half as a guaranteed minimum payment in advance of local
fund-raising events staged by staff in the society's branches.
Nationwide has now told its staff that any continuing fund-raising activity
should be in aid of multiple sclerosis support generally, and it is no
longer receiving donations to Arms.
The society said: 'We felt we had no real option other than to suspend all
direct fund-raising activities.'

FT  11 MAY 92 / Reservations over outlook for hotels: Repossessions in the
industry are at a record
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE TROUBLED British hotels industry has reached a point where a 51-bedroom
hotel has been sold with its goodwill valued at just Pounds 1.
Four years ago, the Yarborough in Grimsby was bought for Pounds 2m. Now,
after the recession that has swept throughout the industry, it has been
repossessed and sold at auction by Christie's for a total of only Pounds
350,000.
Repossessions of hotels are at a record. Even many of the 'character
hotels', which were much in vogue in the 1980s, have not escaped bankruptcy.
The upper end of the market is not immune from the recession. Even the Savoy
in London's Strand says that one in 10 of its guests try to haggle -
unsuccessfully - over their room rates. A manager at the Savoy commented:
'It is a sign of the times. They think that just because business is bad
that they can negotiate their own rates.'
Hotel occupancy rates are lower overall this year than in 1991 - when
business suffered badly because of the effects of the Gulf war - and many in
the industry believe conditions has never been quite so bad.
Christie's says that sale prices for hotels declined by 16 per cent last
year after an average fall of 12 per cent in 1990.
All the indicators point to a continuing fall this year. Rank, the
entertainment and leisure group, revalued its hotel business last October at
15 per cent lower than the previous year.
Queens Moat Houses, a rising star of the trade in the 1980s, had its average
room value independently assessed at Pounds 91,000 in December, against
Pounds 99,000 a year earlier.
Many of the repossessions are of groups and individuals that bought into a
buoyant market in the late 1980s only to see their asset values crumble as
the recession has bitten. At the same time their customer bases dwindled and
income declined.
As the squeeze has tightened, branding has become the main issue,
particularly for the larger hotel groups.
Companies such as Forte, Queens Moat Houses, Vaux and Whitbread have
embarked on costly marketing operations in order to corner niche areas of
the market and so temper the blow of the recession. Labels such as Garden
Court and Travelodge have been created to attract the weekend break customer
and the business traveller.
At the same time, those hotels which do not fit into the rebranding exercise
have been put up for sale. However, there are few buyers at the asking price
as sellers attempt to recoup some of the outlay from the inflated prices
paid in the late 1980s.
Nearly all the big hotel companies have between them several thousand rooms
for sale, although few choose to advertise the fact with so little buyer
interest.
Rank, which has just put its entire UK hotel business up for sale, has been
one of the few to admit difficulties and even then said that the sale might
take years to complete.
The lack of potential buyers, together with rebranding and repossessions,
has meant that the market is awash with stock - with a consequent effect on
prices.
Another indication of the swollen supply side is that Christie's London
office has 40 hotels on its books compared with two at the same time three
years ago.
The banks and institutions that have been badly stung by the present
downturn are reluctant to become involved again.
'There is a lack of liquidity in the market,' admits Mr Donald Maine,
finance director at Forte, 'although there are signs that demand is slowly
creeping back into the market. The situation remains serious, however.'
He says that Forte has had several acceptable offers from companies for its
secondary-location hotels, but that the banks and other institutions have
refused to finance the deals.
Although flickers of recovery have been detected, with some companies
reporting an improvement in occupancy rates since the general election,
industry watchers are not optimistic.
'The market is haemorrhaging,' says Mr Simon Johnstone, a hotels analyst at
Kleinwort Benson, the merchant bank. 'Many of the independent hotels are
going to the wall. It could take up to four years for the industry to return
to the levels of profitability seen in 1989.'

THE National Communications Union is making progress in extending its
membership beyond BT and the Post Office and has won a foothold in the cable
TV industry and at Butlin's, the leisure company, according to a union
recruitment circular.
If UK union membership as a proportion of the working population is not to
dwindle to US levels, unions such as the NCU must expand out of their
shrinking, union-friendly heartlands and seek members in smaller companies
in communications and services. Mr Alan Harley, NCU national organiser, has
reported that the 150,000-strong union is on the way to surpassing its
modest target of recruiting 1,000 members outside BT and the Post Office by
the end of 1992.
The NCU has recruited 350 members in Mercury, the main BT competitor, after
visiting only 10 out of the 70 main sites, but the three-year aim of
recruiting up to half Mercury's 7,000 eligible staff may be over-optimistic.

FT  11 MAY 92 / Government labour policies condemned
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GOVERNMENT policies on unions and unemployment have come under attack from
the International Labour Organisation, the United Nations body responsible
for labour affairs.
Failure to resolve the dispute with unions over representation at the
Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ), the intelligence centre where
unions were banned by the government in 1984, has brought strong criticism
from an ILO committee of experts.
Its annual report 'deplores' that the committee is 'unable to note any
tangible progress on this question or even a resumption of discussions'. The
report emphasises that, under a convention to which the UK is a signatory,
'workers have the right to establish organisations of their own choosing'.
The government has argued that in many countries the activities of GCHQ
would be carried out by military personnel - a category of employee excluded
from the convention.
The committee urges the government to 'resume in the very near future
constructive discussions calculated to lead, through genuine dialogue, to a
compromise acceptable to both sides'.
The ILO is also critical of the 'volume and complexity of legislative change
since 1980' on industrial relations. The Trades Union Congress says that
although the government has indicated that it may consolidate legislation in
future, it does not intend to amend earlier laws that have been criticised
by the ILO.
They include, the TUC says, removing the right of unions to discipline
members who go against ballot decisions on strike action; restrictions on
unions' immunity from civil action over strikes; and allowing the dismissal
of striking workers.
On unemployment, the committee calls on the government to demonstrate how
its policies comply with ILO requirements that countries should pursue
policies designed to promote full, productive and freely chosen employment.
It notes 'the deterioration which has taken place in the employment
situation' and urges the government to consult workers' organisations 'in
the formulation and implementation of employment policies'.

FT  11 MAY 92 / Gould seeks new leader-poll rules
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR BRYAN GOULD, shadow environment secretary and contender for the party
leadership, has proposed a one member, one vote system for future leadership
contests that would end the block vote by unions and MPs.
In an attempt to cast himself as the most radical candidate and to build
support among constituency parties, Mr Gould says in an article in today's
Morning Star that union members who pay the political levy should be able to
convert it to party membership.
That would allow the abolition of Labour's electoral college, which at
present is composed of blocks of votes from the unions, constituency parties
and MPs. 'Like any other democratic institution, there should be one
category of individual membership, and membership alone should carry voting
rights,' Mr Gould says. His support is strongest among the constituency
parties.
The parliamentary party would retain the right of nomination, though fewer
signatures would be required under Mr Gould's scheme. Beyond that, MPs would
have no more rights than constituency members. He argues, however, that
there should continue to be a role for affiliated organisations, including
the unions, during policy making at party conferences. The unions would also
continue to be represented on Labour's ruling national executive committee
and on other party bodies.
His proposals may be received positively in the camp of Mr John Smith,
front-runner in the leadership race. Mr Tony Blair, shadow employment
secretary and a supporter of Mr Smith, said on BBC television yesterday that
he favoured moving to a one member, one vote system in the Labour movement
'with trade union levy payers, who at present . . . pay money but gain very
little influence, being brought into the Labour party'.
Mr Blair said Labour shared 'a bond of values' with the unions which was
more important than the institutional links, but he wanted to 'recast it for
a modern age'.
Mr Gould, who proposes a 'committee of inquiry' into Labour's structures and
constitution, says in his article that 'the link with the trade unions
continues to provide a crucial input from the real world of work into
Labour's deliberations'.

FT  11 MAY 92 / Privatisation is attacked
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
PRIVATISATION of British Coal and British Rail 'give a green light for a new
round of the white-collar rip-off, costing the country dear, but leaving the
City rolling in fat fees', Mr Frank Dobson, shadow energy secretary, said
yesterday.
'Millions of pounds will be poured into the pockets of city firms,' he said.
'Accountants and bankers, brokers, underwriters, estate agents will all make
a fortune. The City is in for a bonanza. Privatisation is a system of
outdoor relief for the advisory classes.'

FT  11 MAY 92 / Companies are criticised
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
TWO THIRDS of the UK's top companies have links with countries that are
abusers of human rights, according to a report published today.
The Ethical Investment Research Service (Eiris) which screens companies for
private investors to see whether they meet certain ethical criteria, says
that 36 of the 50 largest UK companies are involved.
'Many UK company groups have subsidiary and associated companies all over
the world,' Eiris says. 'By operating in a country, the company group is
making a direct investment in that country's economy.'
The survey covers all 590 companies in the FTA All-Share Index at the end of
last year. It found that 200 had subsidiary or associated companies in one
or more of the countries identified, while 31 companies had significant
subsidiaries in countries with high levels of human rights abuses.

FT  11 MAY 92 / EETPU may prompt row
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE newly formed Amal-gamated Engineering and Electrical Union may become
the focus of a Trades Union Congress row over the recruitment of a non-TUC
breakaway group of airline cabin staff.
The EETPU, now the electricians' section of the new union, has agreed to
provide services 'on an agency basis in the first stage' to Cabin Crew '89.
The 5,000-strong cabin crew group broke away from the TGWU general union in
1989. The EETPU was expelled by the TUC in 1988.
Cabin Crew '89, which consists mainly of British Airways staff, after a link
with the airline officers' association Balpa, has turned to the white-collar
section of the EETPU. The electricians will provide support services at
first.
The EETPU section of the AEEU said yesterday that the arrangement had 'not
been entered into to be provocative or controversial' but was between 'one
non-TUC-affiliated trade union and another non-TUC-affiliated union'.
But the arrangement may jeopardise the readmission to the TUC of the
electricians' section of the new union, formed by the amalgamation of the
EETPU and the AEU engineering workers' union.

FT  11 MAY 92 / Lloyd's to consider changing rules
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LLOYD'S, the insurance market, is likely to call a referendum at its annual
meeting in June about introducing retrospective cover for losses incurred by
Names as far back as 1988, Andrew Jack writes. The meeting is also likely
consider mutualisation under which all Names would contribute to the
liability of those who have made the most severe losses.
Lloyd's is pressing for the introduction of corporate, as opposed to
individual, membership of the market as recommended in the Rowlands task
force on its future. The task force also recommended a limit of 100 per cent
losses on premiums to Names as opposed to the traditional unlimited
liability.
Lloyd's received a legal opinion two months ago that admission of corporate
membership would not require a change in legislation governing the market.
It is awaiting a second opinion requested by the Department of Trade and
Industry.
The DTI said last night it had received the first opinion sought by Lloyd's.
'The DTI has asked for more information, which it will need before it can
take a view on how its regulatory responsibilities to the insurance
companies would be affected under the 1982 Insurance Companies Act,' an
official said.

FT  11 MAY 92 / Middle East: Talks in US turn to arms control
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK NICHOLSON, Middle East Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DELEGATES from Israel, its Arab neighbours and other interested countries
convene today in Washington to discuss arms control in the Middle East for
the first time since the Gulf war, in one of five sets of multilateral peace
talks opening this week.
The first sessions of the talks, which shadow the main Arab-Israeli peace
talks and are open to more countries, are not expected to move much beyond
preliminary discussion on the format of further, possibly more substantive,
talks.
In Washington, US officials said the disarmament talks would take a
'seminar' format, with countries presenting papers rather than engaging in
negotiation in the four-day meeting.
The same format will apply to the other four sets of talks: discussion on
economic issues which open today in Brussels under the aegis of the EC;
talks in Ottawa on refugees and in Vienna on water resources, which open on
Wednesday; and discussions on the environment, which open on May 18 in
Tokyo.
The PLO, though formally excluded from the US-brokered peace process,
nevertheless yesterday gave its blessing to Palestinian participation in the
talks.
Israel, however, has decided to shun the meetings on refugees and economic
issues.
On arms control specifically, progress will be limited by Arab countries'
resistance to any arms control regime affecting their ability to arm as they
wish while Israel retains its nuclear deterrent.

FT  11 MAY 92 / Australian states join forces against reform: Hopes of
agreement with PM Keating at talks today are slim
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Paul Keating, Australia's Labor prime minister, will meet the eight state
and territory leaders in Canberra today in an attempt to revive moribund
talks on reform of federal/state relations.
However, the signals from state capitals suggest that agreement on fiscal
and administrative reforms remains as elusive as when the talks broke down
last year.
Mr Ray Groom, the Tasmanian Liberal premier, probably spoke for most of the
state leaders when he accused Mr Keating yesterday of taking a 'financially
homicidal' approach to the talks. 'He is really strangling the states to
death,' Mr Groom said.
The gloomy prognosis contrasts with the rapid progress achieved after Mr Bob
Hawke, the former prime minister, announced his vision of a 'new federalism'
in the wake of Labor's election victory in March 1990. Among other
achievements, Mr Hawke persuaded the states to reduce barriers to interstate
trade, co-operate on transport reforms, and move towards mutual recognition
of trade and professional qualifications.
But the reform process broke down last year after Mr Keating attacked a deal
to correct the imbalance between the states' narrow tax-raising powers and
their growing responsibility for delivering government services.
The solution proposed by Mr Hawke was to give the states a guaranteed share
of federal personal and corporate income tax receipts to supplement the
property and stamp taxes on which they rely for revenue. But that proved too
much for Mr Keating and other Labor centralists, who saw it as a threat to
the party's historical use of federal control of the national purse strings
to determine social policy.
Mr Keating has made some conciliatory overtures to the states since
replacing Mr Hawke in December. But although he has won praise for his
willingness to reopen negotiations, the two sides appear to have sharply
differing agendas for today's talks.
The federal government's priority will be to secure state co-operation for a
series of economic and administrative initiatives announced by Mr Keating in
February.
Most of Mr Keating's energy is likely to focus on plans for the creation of
national rail and electricity networks, and transfer of the states' ADollars
2bn (Pounds 800m) technical and further education programmes to the federal
government.
The prime minister also wants guarantees that the states will implement
costly recommendations by a royal commission by investigating the deaths of
nearly 100 aborigines in police custody.
The state leaders will accept much of what Mr Keating has to say. But for
perhaps the first time in the history of federal-state negotiations, they
are presenting a united front on the need for urgent fiscal reform.
The state leaders agreed at a planning meeting in Melbourne last month to
continue pressing for a greater share of federal tax revenues, and claimed
the states' ADollars 7bn debt could grow to ADollars 12bn by 1997 if nothing
was done.
Mr Keating will do his best to avoid starting an outright battle with the
states in the run-up to the next federal election, due by mid-1993. But
several federal ministers have indicated recently that the government is
likely to tell the states to balance their books by cutting costs.
The federal government may also try to divide the states by proposing
changes to the fiscal equalisation formula, which attempts to maintain a
consistent level of government services by transferring revenue from the
bigger states to the smaller states and territories.

FT  11 MAY 92 / Wealth and power in Europe's qualified democracy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD BALLS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE RATIFICATION of the Maastricht treaties on European monetary and
political union are only now getting under way, but already the attentions
of the Commission have shifted to the next round of treaty revisions. For
while tensions within the European exchange rate mechanism make Emu look an
increasingly long-term goal, the attraction of the EC for potential new
members is undiminished; and further political reform may be a corollary of
widening the EC's membership.
The British government, for one, remains sceptical about the benefits of
further treaty revisions, and protective of the current rights of its
national parliament. Mr Douglas Hurd, the British foreign secretary, has
already reacted negatively to the proposals of the Commission's president,
Mr Jacques Delors. His plan, to be discussed by the Commission this week,
would set up a supra-national executive to replace the existing Commission
and the six-monthly rotating presidency.
Yet the current EC treaties already cede a substantial degree of national
sovereignty to the European centre. The introduction of qualified majority
voting for certain decisions of the Council of Ministers effectively speeded
the evolution of the community from being an agreement between autonomous
member states towards a more integrated  - perhaps federal - political
community.
The Single European Act first introduced majority voting for most of the 300
plus directives which together make the 1992 single market programme. If the
Maastricht treaties are ratified, qualified majority voting will be extended
to the implementation, but not the formulation, of common EC foreign policy;
while decisions on EC immigration policy will be taken by qualified majority
vote after 1996. The Commission has also partly circumvented the UK's veto
on social legislation by introducing its working time directive as health
and safety legislation, which can be passed by a qualified majority vote.
The current system of qualified majority voting, laid down in Article 148 of
the revised Treaty of Rome, gives disproportionate influence to the smaller
countries. The distribution of the 76 votes among 12 EC member states is
shown in the lower portion of the chart. It takes 54 votes - 71 per cent of
the total - to pass a resolution by a 'qualified majority'; and the four
largest countries - Germany, France, Italy and the UK - possess 10 votes
each. So a blocking coalition with at least 23 votes must include either two
large countries plus one small country, or one large country and three
smaller countries.
The system does ensure that a simple majority of seven smaller countries
cannot pass legislation. But the four largest countries possess only 52.8
per cent of total votes compared to 71.5 per cent of total EC population and
78.7 per cent of total EC gross domestic product. The three smallest
countries in economic terms - Greece, Ireland and Luxembourg - make-up 1.8
per cent of EC GDP and 4.3 per cent of EC population but 13.1 per cent of
the votes.
The political power of the smaller countries is also increased by the
six-monthly rotation of the EC presidency which gives them the power to set
and control the community's political agenda. Half the time the presidency
is held by countries which together account for less than 10 per cent of the
EC's population.
The UK government is currently stressing the priority of widening the EC's
membership rather than strengthening the ties between existing members. But
the other large countries are unlikely to agree to admit Austria, Sweden,
Finland and perhaps the eastern European countries too, unless political
power is redistributed and the rotating presidency is replaced. Mr Delors'
plans for a stronger Commission may not be the UK's preferred solution; an
inner cabinet within the Council, consisting of the large states who control
the presidency, with rotating representatives from the smaller countries,
would be one alternative. But the UK may have to use its forthcoming
presidential term to explore alternative solutions, rather then deny there
is a problem.

Seasonally adjusted data used in all cases. Statistics for Germany apply
only to western Germany.  GNP/GDP is broken down into private
consumption expenditure, investment (the sum of gross fixed capital
formation and the change in stocks), general government final
consumption, and net exports (exports of goods and services minus
imports of goods and services). The US includes investment by government
in the government series rather than under investment. Quarterly GNP/GDP
totals are annualised. The growth rates are the percentage change over
the corresponding period in the previous year, and are positive unless
otherwise stated. The figures in the fifth column of each set of growth
rates refer only to exports, rather than to net exports. Data supplied

FT  11 MAY 92 / Angola hovers between recovery and the abyss
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   ANGOLA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
IT HAS the makings of a nightmare, concluded a senior western diplomat in
Luanda after reviewing obstacles in the way of multi-party elections in
Angola on September 29-30.
One year after President Jose Eduardo dos Santos and Mr Jonas Savimbi, the
Unita rebel leader, agreed to end a 16-year civil war, the military
disengagement programme is in trouble, election preparations are inadequate
and the UN monitoring team is overstretched.
The stakes are high. A successful poll would be a milestone in southern
Africa's peace process; failure to hold free and fair elections will dash
hopes of a regional recovery in which oil-rich Angola could play an
important role.
The past year has left Angola poised between recovery and fresh disaster.
In many respects, a remarkable transformation has taken place in a country
which has been at war since independence in 1975. The ceasefire has held,
roads once too dangerous to travel have opened up, and the ruling MPLA has
completed an ideological somersault, abandoning Marxism and moving towards a
market-driven economy. Old allies have been abandoned and former enmities
put aside.
The 50,000 Cuban soldiers who fought alongside the MPLA in the battle
against Unita and South Africa have long gone, seemingly forgotten, and a
Dollars 3bn (Pounds 1.6bn) arms debt to the former Soviet Union has been
repudiated.
Pragmatism has turned Pretoria from adversary to trading partner, and
visiting South African businessmen wax enthusiastic about a market funded by
diamond receipts and oil exports of more than 500,000 barrels a day and
rising.
But the peace agreement which underpins a fragile recovery is under severe
strain.
The pact called on soldiers and guerrillas from the rival armies to report
to 50 assembly points, to be monitored by UN forces, before being
demobilised or entering an integrated national army.
Implementation of the accord is deeply flawed, UN officers concede
privately. Both sides, they suspect, have prepared arms caches while the
demobilisation exercise itself is well behind schedule. The creation of an
integrated national force has hardly begun, although August was the
completion date.
The prospect of an election taking place before the disengagement of two
bitter foes is complete is, in itself, the stuff of nightmares. But
difficulties are being compounded by the weak bureaucracy's delay in
establishing the administrative framework for what will be the first
multi-party poll since independence.
Despite repeated urging by western diplomats and UN officials, it was not
until the weekend that the government appointed an electoral commission. It
has not yet begun the registration of voters among a population of some 10m,
in a country five times the size of Great Britain.
The over-riding problem, say local diplomats, is the fact that the MPLA,
acutely short of skilled personnel, is using the little it has to perform
the rudimentary functions of government and conduct the party's fight for
its political survival. It cannot run the election as well.
Many diplomats conclude that unless there is additional external help, the
poll will either have to be delayed or would be so poorly organised as to
lack credibility. Part of the answer, they believe, is to boost the strength
and extend the role of the existing UN presence in Angola, operating under
the mandate of last year's Security Council Resolution 747.
A UN team, expected to total 600 by polling day, is monitoring the
transition and preparing to observe the election. No fewer than 10 times
that number supervised neighbouring Namibia's transition to independence in
1989.
Ms Margaret Anstee, the official in charge of the UN operation in Angola,
has no illusions about the task ahead. 'I have to fly a 747 with only enough
fuel for a DC3,' she says.
It is tempting to add that, without more fuel, Angola's transition to
democracy could be heading for a crash landing.

FT  11 MAY 92 / The European Market: Central Europe surveys an imperfect
pact - Benefits from a trade accord with the EC could take time to
materialise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Community's trade liberalisation agreement with Poland,
Czech-oslovakia and Hungary is designed to give the countries' goods greater
access to western markets. In practice, at least for the first few years,
the main benefits will probably be felt not by industries in these countries
but by their western competitors.
Well-financed and technologically superior exporters from the west are
likely to profit more quickly from the advantages of free trade than
struggling industries in the former communist states.
This would accelerate the process of structural change under way in central
Europe - but could also heighten the risk of a political backlash as the
economic pain spreads.
The mere act of signing the March 1 agreement was 'the art of the possible',
says Mr Karel Lukas, Czechoslovakia's ambassador to the EC. 'It brought us
closer to the Community. It was the maximum of what was possible.'
Exporters from Czechoslovakia, like others from central and eastern Europe,
have already made progress in carving out fresh markets in the west over the
past two years. None the less, the accord runs the risk of being seen as
lop-sided.
Barriers are maintained on exports of key products such as steel, textiles,
chemicals and glass, although they will be gradually lowered and removed
altogether after 10 years. Curbs on sales of farm produce into the EC's
heavily protected agricultural market will remain in force.
Confronted by a collapse in trade with the former communist bloc, many
industries from the three central European countries have diverted export
efforts to the west. But they still have a long way to go.
Illustrating the anxieties about whether the EC accord may prove to be
inadequate, one official at the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development (OECD) in Paris says: 'For the areas where they (the three) are
most competitive, the industrialised countries are the most protectionist.
This is virtually insoluble.'
Possible problems ahead are underlined by OECD estimates of the balance of
payments outlook for the countries. According to the projections, prepared
for a series of international economic meetings in Paris beginning this
week, the current account deficit of five central and eastern European
countries will rise from Dollars 3.1bn (Pounds 1.75bn) in 1990 and Dollars
3.6bn in 1991 to Dollars 5.6bn in 1992.
The deficit - for Poland, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria and Romania - is
projected to fall to Dollars 4.8bn in 1993.
Mitigating the gloom about future prospects, data collected by the OECD show
that most central and east European countries succeeded in keeping foreign
trade with the west on an even keel last year.
The exception was Poland, which saw its trade balance with the 24-nation
OECD swing from a surplus of Dollars 1.2bn in 1990 to a deficit of Dollars
2.7bn in 1991. Poland managed only a moderate increase in exports, while
imports soared. The OECD blames a deline in exports since the middle of last
year partly on an overvalued zloty.
Czechoslovakia, by contrast, increased its exports to the OECD area by 39.2
per cent last year (measured in European currency units), against a rise of
only 1.8 per cent in 1990. Hungary achieved a 20.8 per cent export rise,
while Bulgaria increased exports by 30.2 per cent.
Mr Jan Truszczynski, an economic diplomat at Poland's EC office in Brussels,
points out the extent to which his country has switched trade towards the
EC.
In 1988, a year before a five-year trade and economic co-operation agreement
between Poland and the EC came into force, the Community accounted for 28
per cent of Poland's total exports and imports.
Last year trade with the EC made up 54 per cent of exports and 48 per cent
of imports. Mr Truszczynski emphasises, however, the twin pressures on
Polish industries facing competition from abroad. Polish farmers are
demanding faster liberalisation for their produce and are, at the same time,
pleading for extra duties against 'well-advertised, attractively packaged
food products' pouring into their country.
Such imports are likely to continue. In view of the swing away from trade
with the former Soviet Union and the other Comecon countries towards more
integration with the west, the EC clearly has a greater responsibility than
before for central and eastern Europe's economic fate.
Economic output in most of the states there is estimated to have dropped by
between 10 and 20 per cent last year. On average, two thirds of the output
decline is estimated to have been caused by the collapse in intra-Comecon
trade.
This year a further decline in output, though at a slower rate, is expected
across the region. The OECD is then hoping for a modest upturn from 1993.
Eventual hopes for recovery depend on the former communist states being able
to develop efficient and well-managed export industries. Unless the west
provides the markets, these efforts are unlikely to succeed.

THE World Bank will link loan volume to the strength of a country's efforts
to fight poverty, according to an operational directive to staff issued
today by Mr Lewis Preston, the bank's president.
The link between loans and poverty relief forms part of a new drive to make
poverty alleviation the bank's central mission in the 1990s.
The shift in priorities is also reflected in a commitment to make
comprehensive assessments of the nature and extent of poverty in the third
world, allowing the bank to design more effective policies to fight poverty.
In the directive, Mr Preston says poverty reduction is 'the benchmark by
which our performance as a development institution will be measured'. He
adds that the new instructions to staff are intended to 'ensure that these
policies are fully reflected in the bank's operations'.
The bank is also publishing a handbook containing examples of past best
practice on poverty reduction.
The bank says poverty assessments should be available for most developing
countries within two years. These would form the basis for a 'collaborative
approach to poverty reduction by country officials and the bank'.
The directive signals an attempt to impose a form of 'social conditionality'
on borrowing countries. 'Stronger government commitment to poverty reduction
warrants greater support; conversely, weaker commitment to poverty reduction
warrants less support,' it says.
Mr Preston's emphasis on poverty is a reaction to bank policies in the
1980s, when the aim was to improve economic efficiency in developing
countries. The new directive says structural adjustment lending in the past
decade 'overshadowed the bank's poverty reduction objectives'.
The bank is also reacting to new evidence suggesting that the number of poor
in developing countries will rise during the 1990s, rather than stabilise as
had been expected.
