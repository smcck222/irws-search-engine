FT  11 MAY 92 / Ministers accept principle of loans to Latin America
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK BLUM and DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Investment Bank (EIB) is to be allowed to lend to Latin America
and to countries with which the European Community has co-operation
agreements, European finance ministers agreed on Saturday.
The decision mainly affects Latin America, as the EC has separate
arrangements for other regions. Ministers set a ceiling of Ecu250m (Pounds
175m) annually over three to four years for EIB lending for projects to be
agreed on a case-by-case basis.
Mr Carlos Solchaga, the Spanish finance minister, was enthusiastic about the
agreement, which will be reviewed in three years. He said: 'We've broken the
barrier preventing Latin America from getting EIB loans.' Spain and
Portugal, which have close ties with Latin America, had been pressing to
allow EIB lending to the region.
A mechanism to establish guarantees for the loans has yet to be established.
Mr Michel Sapin, the French finance minister, said France was not in favour
of guarantees coming from the Community's budget, but he expected a solution
within weeks.
The EC foreign ministers stressed the importance of the International
Monetary Fund and the World Bank in co-ordinating financial assistance to
the states of the former Soviet Union.
This did not exclude an EC role, said Mr Jorge Braga de Macedo, Portugal's
finance minister. But Mr Norman Lamont, UK chancellor, was more cautious,
saying that 'until these countries have IMF programmes in place, (EC)
assistance would not be appropriate'.

FT  11 MAY 92 / Split over anti-Tory plan: Ashdown offer meets a mixed
response from Labour
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LABOUR's schisms over post-election tactics and trade union links deepened
yesterday as reaction to a Liberal Democrat offer to help forge an anti-Tory
force varied markedly across the Labour movement.
An attempt by Mr Paddy Ashdown, Liberal Democrat leader, to trigger a
realignment of UK opposition parties provoked a surprisingly positive
reaction from supporters of the two main leadership candidates, Mr Bryan
Gould and Mr John Smith.
But the reception was far frostier from left wingers, including Mrs Margaret
Beckett, challenger for deputy leader. Mr Roy Hattersley, outgoing deputy
leader, said: 'No party is going to succeed with a blurred message . . . the
Labour party's ideological cutting edge has to be sharper, not blunter.'
At the same time, a move by Mr Gould to end the trade union leaders' role in
the leadership contest, clashed with a warning on London Weekend Television
from Mr Bill Morris, leader of the TGWU, that funding of Labour by the
unions could be jeopardised if institutional links were broken.
Mr Gould said Mr Ashdown's speech was 'interesting,' adding: 'If Labour and
the Liberal Democrats can find that they agree on a range of issues, this
could help to reduce the Conservative vote.' But he emphasised: 'This should
be the opposition parties' priority, rather than re-arranging support
between Labour and the Liberal Democrats.'
Mr Tony Blair, Labour's employment spokesman and supporter of Mr John Smith
for leader, went out of his way on BBC television to say he did not want to
be 'churlish' and that he 'believed in a dialogue of ideas'
But he wanted Mr Ashdown to make clear the Liberal Democrats were a
left-of-centre party, rather than, 'simply part of the wishy-washy centre
who will do a deal with anyone.'
Mr Blair rejected Mr Ashdown's specific proposal for a policy forum or
forums, saying: 'The moment you start entering into formal pacts or setting
up forums then what you get is the belief that the way forward is deals -
and it is not.'
Mr Ashdown's speech on Saturday was not prescriptive about mechanisms, but
signalled a willingness to work with Labour to prevent the entrenchment 'of
almost permanent one-party government'.
It also rejected electoral deals, but said Labour could not win alone.
A Fabian pamphlet today highlights the varying explanations within the
Labour movement for its general election defeat.
Mr Peter Mandelson, Labour MP for Hartlepool and former campaigns director,
said the party looked, 'weak and muddled' by fuelling media interest in
electoral reform.
Mr Blair in his article calls for Labour to become the 'party that stands up
to vested interests,' including in the public sector.
In the same pamphlet, Mr Calum Macdonald, Labour MP for the Western Isles,
backs working the Liberal Democrats on policy issues and, reinforcing calls
for a consensus, the pamphlet's leading article asks, 'is there room in
British politics for more than one party to take on the (Tory) party, which
has defended vested interest and the status quo with such depressing success
for so long?'

FT  11 MAY 92 / Archbishop's sermon attacks top executives over pay rises
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BULGING pay packets of Britain's top executives were exposed to the
wrath of the church yesterday when Dr George Carey, the archbishop of
Canterbury, criticised businessmen who awarded themselves big increases
during the recession.
A 700-strong congregation, including Sir John Banham, director-general of
the Confederation of British Industry, was treated to a stinging sermon on
the nature of wealth creation during a service at Derby Cathedral to give
thanks for the achievements of industry.
Turning the service into a penitential occasion, Dr Carey said it was wrong
to 'make money for its own sake'.
He added: 'Within our own society, our collective commitment to industrial
enterprise will remain underpowered if the fruits of success appear to be
concentrated too heavily in the pockets of shareholders and senior
executives.'
'For example, massive individual pay rises during a recession do not
encourage public support for wealth creation.'
The archbishop said the purpose of industry was to serve the public by
creating services to meet their needs. 'It is not to make profits for
shareholders, nor to create salaries and wages for the industrial community.
These are necessary conditions for success but not its purpose.'
He questioned whether industry was fulfilling its purpose when 'prolonged
bursts of private-sector-led economic growth' in advanced countries left
more people than ever in the world 'hungry, thirsty, naked, ill or in
prison'.
But Mr Peter Morgan, director-general of the Institute of Directors, said:
'I prefer Adam Smith to the archbishop on the question of understanding the
purpose of business.' He added that it was naive to suppose there was a link
between directors' payment and booms and slumps.
The British Institute of Management supporting Dr Carey said some top
directors had been 'greedy' in awarding themselves pay rises above the
inflation rate.
Mr Roger Young, director-general of the 75,000-member institute, said that
while directors of small companies had shown restraint, those of some big
companies had been 'insensitive'.
Among recent large pay increases was that paid to Mr Lawrence Urquhart,
chairman and chief executive of Burmah Castrol, whose salary rose 40 per
cent last year to Pounds 385,000 despite annual profits remaining static. Mr
Robert Evans, the chairman of British Gas saw his salary more than double to
Pounds 435,222 since becoming chairman and chief executive in July 1989.
Dr Carey's own stipend rose by 6.3 per cent in April to Pounds 43,550 a
year.
But it is not what it was before Queen Victoria's reign. In 1835, before the
creation of the ecclesiastical commissioners, the archbishop of Canterbury
had a stipend of Pounds 19,000, equal today to an annual salary of Pounds
880,000 that would put him ahead of most captains of industry.

FT  11 MAY 92 / Pay deal may force German inflation higher
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FURTHER upward pressure on west German inflation is inevitable after last
week's public services pay deal, the Bundesbank president and local
government leaders warned at the weekend.
The settlement, which will add 5.12 per cent to federal, state and local
authority pay bills, will also have 'regrettable consequences' for postal
and travel charges and boost expectations among private sector employees,
according to Mr Helmut Schlesinger, the central bank president.
'The situation has not been made any easier for us,' he said after an EC
finance ministers' meeting in Oporto, Portugal.
Mr Schlesinger's comments, his first since last week's strike settlement,
further underline the Bundesbank's determination not to relax monetary
policy until there are clear signs of deceleration in money supply growth
and a turndown in inflation, currently running at an annual rate of about
4.5 per cent.
Mr Hans Gottfried Bernrath, president of the local authorities association,
said charges for labour-intensive services, such as rubbish collection,
would be especially affected. People would also have to pay more for
kindergarten and creche facilities, colleagues warned.
Engineering employers and unions, meanwhile, prepared for their expected
showdown this week. A meeting in the southern state of Hesse this morning
would be the companies' 'last chance' to present a negotiable offer, said Mr
Franz Steinkuhler, leader of the IG Metall union.
Mr Steinkuhler, representing 4m workers, again threatened a long and hard
strike. If the employers failed to increase their 3.3 per cent offer, 'then
the ballot and strikes will come much more quickly than some desktop
strategists and loudmouths think,' he told a rally in Karlsruhe.
Although he showed some signs of flexibility, calling for not less than 6
per cent in place of the union's initial 9.5 per cent demand, there was no
indication yesterday that the employers were prepared to give ground. Most
have been long reconciled to a bruising conflict.
Up to 200,000 metalworkers are expected to respond today to renewed calls
for 'warning strikes', as the engineering negotiations move to centre stage
in Germany's bitter wages rounds.
Disruption hit many private sector companies last week as building, and
printing workers joined the engineers in protest stoppages, but the effects
were blurred by the dominating influence of the first national public
services strike in 18 years.
Following last Thursday's public sector settlement, to be put to a
membership vote today, the engineers are likely to throw their full weight
behind their own campaign.
Complaints continued at the weekend from public services workers
disappointed by the outcome of their strike. Ms Monika Wulf-Mathies,
president of the main union involved, oTV, insisted that its 'political and
material effects deal should not be underestimated'.

FT  11 MAY 92 / World's industrial nations make jobless top priority
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE WORLD'S leading industrialised countries have placed unemployment back
at the top of the international economic agenda, as concern has grown in
several nations at a sharp rise in jobless totals over the past two years.
Unemployment and wider social issues such as crime, inner city decline,
immigration and racial and religious intolerance will be tackled in the
first session of a two-day meeting of ministers from the 24 industrialised
member states of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development
(OECD) that starts in Paris a week today.
The issue will be given more prominence than at any time since the early
1980s, reflecting rapid growth in unemployment in the OECD area to 30m from
less than 25m two years ago.
France, the US and the OECD secretariat have been especially keen to put
unemployment high on the agenda. But Britain, which last week omitted any
reference to unemployment in the Queen's speech outlining Mr John Major's
legislative programme, is adopting a low-key approach to the OECD talks. Mr
Michael Portillo, the new chief secretary to the Treasury, will go to Paris
instead of Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, accompanied by junior trade and
foreign ministers.
The 5m jump in unemployment since 1990 has reversed most of the fall in OECD
jobless achieved through strong growth in the 1980s. The rise is viewed with
particular concern because people in virtually all age groups and skill
categories are affected. The OECD is especially worried about Europe, where
unemployment is increasingly a white collar phenomenon and is expected to
remain high for some years.
The OECD's latest standardised jobless statistics showed that unemployment
affected 9.2 per cent of the European Community's workforce in February
compared with an average OECD unemployment rate of 7.2 per cent. The
organisation has warned that developments in March pointed to 'a possible
further deterioration in the OECD unemployment situation'.
At the weekend, however, EC economics and finance ministers rejected any
short cuts to stimulate growth and reduce unemployment in the community.
After a French-inspired discussion on the effect of Germany's high interest
rates on growth and employment, they agreed at an informal meeting in
Oporto, Portugal, that fiscal rigour and structural reforms were the best
way to create jobs.
Next week's OECD meeting is likely to reach similar conclusions. The
ministers are expected to stress the need for strengthening education and
training, encouraging flexible wage setting, and promoting 'active' labour
market policies that shift the emphasis from income support during
unemployment to increasing the incentives for the unemployed to seek jobs.

FT  11 MAY 92 / Billionaire populist on a mission / Profile of US
presidential proto-candidate Ross Perot
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is customary in the United States to announce an intent to run for the
highest office in circumstances of appropriate gravity. The backdrop of
Mount Rushmore, with its four sculpted presidential heads, is not mandatory,
but it is the sort of prop that helps. Ross Perot did it on Larry King Live.
Perhaps he was just cocking a snook at the political system with which he is
so profoundly discontent. Perhaps he was being politically astute beyond all
measure, for if the age of the telepopulist can be said to have dawned under
Ronald Reagan, it is reaching its acme, or nadir, in this strangest of
election years and in the as-yet-undeclared but widely assumed independent
presidential candidacy of H (for Henry) Ross Perot.
It is easy to be dismissive, or adulatory, about Perot. The indomitable
Molly Ivins, the best big journalist in Texas, probably sums it up best: 'As
Texas billionaires go, he is one of the best we got.' The exception is that
most of this breed do not range that far outside the oil 'bidness' and
buying a few senators and foreign potentates.
Perot is much more than this. He is a man of left and right, in favour of
abortion and gun control and against the Gulf war, but opposed to welfare
and a hero in the business world: the apolitical billion dollar action man
with a mission to rescue the people from the travails of government, a Jimmy
Stewart from hard-scrabble Texas minus 10 inches, with a crew cut, jug ears
and, as Ms Ivins notes, 'the voice of a chihuahua'.
But he is also a fair-sized folk hero for his missions to find prisoners of
war in Indochina and to rescue his own employees from the Tehran mullahs,
and he has compiled a corporate record worthy of envy, from the time when,
not long out of the Navy, he met his annual IBM sales target by the middle
of January. The ultimate entrepreneur, he started his own data processing
company with Dollars 1,000 in 1962, sold it to General Motors 22 years later
for Dollars 2.5bn, and, two years after that, was paid another Dollars 700m
by GM to leave the board and shut up about the company's failings (which,
characteristically, he did not).
But all this does not really explain why Perot is running George Bush and
Bill Clinton close in national public opinion polls. After all, businessmen
do not normally aspire to run the nation. The last 10 presidents have
comprised eight politicians, a soldier and an actor, none of whom can really
be said to have met a substantial payroll outside of politics and Jimmy
Carter's peanut warehouse.
This may be part of the Perot populist appeal at a time of general
disenchantment with politics as usual and with Messrs Bush and Clinton in
particular. But the real clue to his phenomenal rise - and maybe ultimately
to his political fall - lies in the medium he has chosen to carry him to a
state beyond all rational expectations; and not just any medium, a very
special and very popular one.
This is where Larry King Live comes in. Perot did not really announce a
candidacy but artfully allowed it to be dragged out of him by the eponymous
television talk show host, a gravel-voiced veteran of the late night, who
wears trademark braces, keeps his sentences short and requires the same of
those to whom he talks. Perot said he would run if the people put his name
on every state ballot and, if they did, he had Dollars 100m of his own money
to finance the effort.
Next stop was Phil Donahue (the daytime programme for housewives) and then
60 Minutes, the grandaddy of current affairs programmes and the accepted
confessional for those who want to get something off their chest, and then
David Frost, always good for respectability, as Richard Nixon found, and too
many more shows to mention.
And if the public's perception of what he stood for remained hazy, they
firmly grasped that one of the great tools of a Perot presidency would be
the electronic town meeting, in which a wired country could simply call up
its president and determine national policy. Perot told Frost this was
exactly what he would do if raising taxes was an issue. Hang the Congress,
stuff the Supreme Court, never mind the Constitution, this would be a
personal relationship. Which is precisely the purpose - and the popularity -
of most of the programmes on which Perot had appeared. It was indeed
telepopulism in the raw.
But, having thrived by the sword, Perot must now endure its cuts. A week
ago, after a particularly rough television session with professional
political journalists asking a lot of boring questions about the feasibility
of his budget cutting proposals, he confessed he had been badly advised.
For the record, he had said the Dollars 400bn budget deficit could be pretty
much eliminated overnight by Dollars 180bn savings on fraud and waste,
cutting Dollars 100bn from welfare, and getting Japan and other US allies to
kick in another Dollars 100bn for the privilege of sheltering under the US
defence umbrella. Beating a quick retreat, his campaign promptly announced
that the proto-candidate would be giving no more interviews - not for 60
minutes but for 60 days.
This might be a brilliant ruse. Having excited interest, he can let Messrs
Bush and Clinton get on with unimpressing the country and then descend again
with enough thought-out policies to emerge as a saviour. He might also spend
the time building the nuts-and-bolts national political organisation that
his army of amateur volunteers does not yet constitute and the lack of which
causes most independent candidacies to wither.
But it is also a big gamble. First, the two main candidates might establish
themselves while he is out of the public eye, and being almost invisible in
the wake of the Los Angeles disturbances has probably not helped his
credibility, even if it has not necessarily enhanced that of the other two.
Second, and keeping very much in the public eye, a lot of awkward questions
are now being asked about his conduct as a businessman and some of the
things he has done for his government. This probing may not be worse than
anything Bill Clinton has had to endure this year, but it is now a necessary
rite of passage for a would-be president and it may be hard for a
confessedly autocratic businessman to handle.
Further, though Perot is deeply critical of government, it is undoubtedly
the case that he has waxed rich through dealings with it, from his first and
fortune-making contract to computerise medical care payments in the 1960s,
all the way to his current negotiations for federal assistance to develop
his newest airport in Fort Worth.
Some of his extra-curricular activities on behalf of the government are
being scrutinised. Running missions to Indochina and responding to an
administration approach to bail out Du Pont, Glore, Forgan, the failing
securities firm, in the early 1970s appear above board. But lending a
helping hand and offering Dollars 50m to the Nixon White House's public
relations effort over the Vietnam War and running errands for Ollie North of
Iran-contra notoriety go down less well. Even the precise circumstances of
the rescue in 1979 of EDS employees in Tehran, especially as glamorised in
Ken Follet's novel Wings of Eagles, are now being questioned.
A final curiosity centres on his patent animosity towards George Bush.
Ostensibly, it is because Perot believes the president has failed to lead,
but there seems more to it. One suspicion is that Mr Bush's blocking of
further attempts to find Americans missing in Indochina has infuriated
Perot; another that it is rooted in the contrast between down-at-heel
Texarkana, where he grew up, and the mahoganied oil clubs of Houston, which
are Mr Bush's milieu.
Whatever the cause, there is one quality to Perot on which all agree. He
remains a brilliant salesman. This, of course, is the essence of the
populist tradition, regardless of whether the merchandise be computer
systems or politics or snake oil or a combination of all three. The country,
it seems, is tempted by the wrapping but it has not really tasted the
ingredients.

FT  11 MAY 92 / Mr Preston makes poverty his judge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Suppose you are a middle-ranking World Bank official trying to put together
a lending programme for a Third World country. What kind of loan will most
enhance your promotion prospects? Judging from an unusually frank
operational directive issued today by Mr Lewis Preston, the World Bank
president, the answer is a loan designed explicitly to reduce poverty.
In a foreword to the directive, which is being distributed to Bank offices
throughout the world, Mr Preston states: 'Sustainable poverty reduction is
the overarching objective of the World Bank. It is the benchmark by which
our performance as a development institution will be measured.'
Mr Preston was under no obligation to make such a strong pledge. The idea of
putting greater stress on poverty originated with his predecessor, Mr Barber
Conable. If Mr Preston, who has spent his entire career on Wall Street, had
been unsympathetic to this shift in Bank priorities, he could have let the
Conable initiative quietly lapse. Instead, he is serving notice of a
cultural revolution: staff who expect to be upwardly mobile during his
presidency had better make poverty reduction their top priority.
The sudden emphasis on poverty may seem rather confusing. After all, the
Bank has been promoting economic development for more than four decades;
surely this means that poverty alleviation has always been its 'overarching
objective'. Alas, this is far from the case.
In its first few decades, the Bank was addicted to project lending. It
supported investments that had high rates of return, but made no special
effort to locate them in areas of poverty or to ensure that the worst-off
groups benefited. In the 1970s, it became aware that the poorest often
gained little from general economic development, but it lacked a
comprehensive strategy for tackling poverty. During the Reagan-Thatcher
years, poverty took a back seat; the Bank swam with the ideological current,
making the promotion of economic efficiency and growth its primary goal. As
today's directive openly concedes: 'In the early 1980s, policy-based
adjustment lending overshadowed the Bank's poverty reduction objectives.'
Some conservative economists still argue that the Bank should strive mainly
to promote growth, claiming that the poor will benefit from 'trickle down'
effects. Today's leading capitalist economies grew rapidly, the argument
runs, precisely because a low priority was initially placed on alleviating
poverty. But would the Industrial Revolution really have been aborted if
Victorian mill owners had cared about poverty?
Modern research suggests not. By today's standards, the UK's Industrial
Revolution was rather inefficient. Starting in 1780, the UK took 58 years to
double its per capita income. In modern times, South Korea did the same in
just 11 years. The acceleration partly reflects access to modern technology.
But social policy also plays a role. If South Korea had paid as little
attention to the education and health care of workers as Britain did in the
19th century, it would have developed less rapidly. By building 'human
capital', poverty alleviation adds to, rather than subtracts from, a
country's growth potential.
The Bank's theoretical strategy for reducing poverty is well known. It
consists of a 'two-pronged' approach: economic reforms to promote
labour-intensive growth supported by improved social services to allow the
poor to take full advantage of income-earning opportunities. The importance
of today's directive is to ensure that the crucial second prong is
implemented. As Mr Sven Sandstrom, one of Mr Preston's top aides, warned in
a briefing, too often sensible policies 'are not followed through with
sufficient vigour to have a significant impact'.
The first important reform mandated by today's directive is a requirement
that Bank officials undertake comprehensive poverty assessments in all
client countries. No, you have not misread that sentence. For more than 40
years the Bank has tried to promote development without a road map - without
a clear understanding of the extent and nature of poverty in the Third
World. Poverty assessments will include profiles of the poor, details of
existing safety nets, and summaries of the impact on poverty of existing
government spending and regulatory policies.
The second important reform is a commitment to make loans conditional on
social justice as well as economic efficiency. The directive states that the
volume of loans should be linked to the strength of a country's efforts to
reduce poverty. Or as Mr Preston's press release puts it: 'Stronger
government commitment to poverty reduction warrants greater support;
conversely weaker commitment to poverty reduction warrants less support.'
The release also says the composition of lending will be tailored to support
local efforts to reduce poverty.
Mr Preston's directive is an endorsement of Asian development strategies,
which have generally placed considerable stress on social services. It makes
a great deal of sense. But it will succeed only if pursued with firmness and
tact. If 'social conditionality' is to take hold in the 1990s, attitudes
will have to change fundamentally, both within developing countries and the
Bank. Mr Preston, however, has left no doubt of the criterion by which he
expects to be judged.

FT  11 MAY 92 / The debaters could do better
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Debate on the Maastricht Treaty in the French parliament is presenting an
absorbing spectacle of the French political establishment at work. After an
abortive rearguard attempt by an old-style Gaullist to have the treaty
thrown out altogether, the National Assembly last week ploughed into a
three-day debate, in which all the party spokesmen delivered their weighty
speeches. This first phase of the process will be wound up tomorrow with,
probably, a solid vote in favour.
What the debate has revealed so far is that there is an unexpectedly large
minority in the National Assembly, and probably therefore an even larger
minority in the country at large, which is passionately opposed to the
European Community and all it stands for. The Communists, of course, all
voted en bloc for the rearguard action; but the fact that nearly half the
Gaullists did so as well was much less expected.
We should not have been surprised. The federalist tendencies in the
Maastricht Treaty are deeply at odds with the nationalist values of
Gaullism; it was after all an alliance between Gaullists and Communists
which finally defeated the ill-starred project for a European Defence
Community in 1954. Many of the Gaullist faithful were likely to answer the
call to fight the federalists.
Yet even the Gaullist party leadership was taken by surprise. Some say that
Maastricht has prompted the most intense French debate on Europe since the
Treaty of Rome in 1957. It is nearer the truth to say that it has prompted
the only real debate on Europe since 1957. In practice, discussion of Europe
has been stifled, for two reasons.
First, the French treat the European Community as a branch of foreign
policy, which comes under the exclusive authority of the president; the
French parliament is told what happens in Brussels, but is not consulted.
When the Single European Act came up for ratification in 1986, Mr Jacques
Chirac and the Gaullists were in power; they did not presume to reject it.
Second, although Mr Chirac is uncontested leader of the Gaullist party, he
appears to have no political convictions on anything. On Europe he has taken
refuge in ambiguity, and his party has not been forced to decide where it
stands.
The Gaullists' official ambiguity on Europe was glaringly obvious last week.
Socialists, centrists and the centre-right UDF all set out their views on
the future of the Community; they mostly approved the Maastricht Treaty and
the general direction it was pointing.
But Alain Juppe, secretary-general of the Gaullists, was careful not to
describe a Gaullist vision of Europe. He said the Gaullists would vote yes
to the treaty, provided the government introduced a long list of domestic
safeguards; although how he could promise any such thing is a mystery.
Among other changes, he wanted the French constitution to say that French
sovereignty is inalienable, that the Community is composed of a union of
independent states, that France will continue to have an ultimate right of
veto in Brussels, and that the National Assembly will in future be consulted
on Community legislation. By contrast, the Gaullists would not agree to give
the vote in local elections to residents from other EC countries.
This insistence on sovereignty is understandable. As an ancient and
centralised unitary state, France is challenged especially deeply by the
Community model: the one is Jacobin, universalist, interventionist and
assimilationist; the other is liberal, pluralist, decentralised and
quasi-federal. It is not just the Gaullists who feel this clash of political
culture.
Yet it is a pity that the French debate has largely side-stepped two major
strategic dilemmas* facing the Community. The first is the nature of
European union; if this is the aim, Europe's parliaments and peoples will
need a much clearer and more explicit explanation than could be deduced from
the current French debate. To claim that we cannot foresee the final stage
is just a facile excuse: every extra step will become more difficult for
national political systems, and the full implications must be spelled out,
debated and accepted.
The second strategic dilemma is that of enlargement. There is a foolish but
common assumption that the Community has an obligation to admit 10 or 20 new
members. Yet it is plain that a 30-member Community could not create a real
European union, and would probably fall apart. Do the advocates of limitless
enlargement, like the Gaullists and the British Conservatives, really want a
Community which is dominated by small countries, many of which are neutral?
They do not tell us.
We can be sure that this will not be France's last big debate on Europe. We
must just hope that practice makes perfect, and that they will do better
next time.

FT  11 MAY 92 / Foreign Exchanges and Money Markets: Fears over US rates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DESPITE the announcement of better-than-expected April employment figures in
Washington last week, the foreign exchange markets are still looking for
clear signs of the long-awaited US economic recovery, writes James Blitz.
On Friday, the dollar staged a small rally on the back of the rise in non
farm payroll by 126,000. But uncertainty remains over whether the Federal
Reserve may cut its Fed funds rate again, with analysts looking ahead to
Wednesday's retail sales figures for any indication of movement. 'We can't
rule out another interest rate cut if those retail sales figures are on the
weak side,' says Mr Neil MacKinnon, chief economist at Yamaichi
International in London. The market forecast is for a rise of 0.3 per cent.
Another cut in US interest rates would undermine investor confidence in the
dollar, not least because German short-term interest rates are six points
higher.
The recent strength of both sterling and the French franc against the D-Mark
may also be tested by indicators in both countries this week. On Friday, the
monthly UK Retail Prices Index is published, with the market expecting it to
show a year-on-year rise in April of 4.4 per cent. Provisional consumer
prices are published in France on the same day, with analysts forecasting a
month-on-month rise of 0.3 per cent.
If the figures overshoot in either country, the markets may question whether
their respective governments were wise to engineer a half per cent cut in
base rates last week.
Trading in the yen may pick up again after the lull of recent days, which
was mostly due to Japan's golden week holiday. Analysts have suggested that
the yen could soon strengthen to Y130 to the dollar from its current
position of around Y133.

FT  11 MAY 92 / US Corporate Bonds: Treasuries rally may bring new wave of
borrowing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE STRONG performance of the US Treasury market in the wake of last week's
quarterly refunding has pushed the yield on the long - 30-year - bond back
below the key level of 8 per cent. It could also open the door to a fresh
round of corporate fund-raising.
The domestic US corporate bond market got off to a busy start to the year,
with more than Dollars 75bn of fresh debt in the first quarter. The pace of
activity slowed subsequently, as yields in the US bond market climbed - but
last week's rally in the market could bring companies back to the market.
'The 7.9 per cent long bond yield reached in Friday's rally will flush out
some more borrowers,' forecast Mr Joe MacHale, managing director, capital
markets, at JP Morgan Securities in New York.
The calendar of potential issues has been building in recent weeks,
according to underwriters. However, a cap on supply was created because US
companies were no longer able to meet their funding targets when the
Treasury market weakened.
Although other factors, such as the shape of the yield curve and the
performance of corporate spreads, are also important in determining
borrowers' funding costs, the 8 per cent yield level on the long bond has
proved an important psychological barrier for issuers. Most companies are
looking at fixed-rate funds.
'If you look at rates as far back as 1979, corporate funding rates are
currently at the low end of the range,' said Mr Bob Scott, head of fixed
income at Morgan Stanley.
However, borrowers are facing a difficult choice. They are keen to extend
the maturity profile of their debt by securing longer-term funding through
the bond markets, in order to refinance short-term debt. The difficulties
experienced by some companies in rolling over commercial paper have made
treasurers reluctant to become dependent on short-term debt.
However, the steep shape of the yield curve means borrowers have to pay as
much as four points more to raise long-term, rather than short-term, funds.
Short-term rates have reached historically low levels, which many borrowers
find hard to pass up.
'If the economy picks up further, more companies will be prepared to make
that trade-off,' said one Wall Street capital markets analyst.
In addition, many borrowers still believe that US interest rates have
further to fall, and are willing to hold on. The same attitude is
contributing to a lack of opportunities in the swap market: a lack of
fixed-rate payers in the swap market has kept swap spreads very narrow, so
post-swap floating-rate funding levels are not attractive.
Meanwhile, investor demand remains robust. US institutions have substantial
amounts of cash to invest, and, with expectations of 3 per cent to 3 1/2 per
cent inflation, continue to take a reasonably positive view of the bond
market. Demand is spread across the board, with pension funds, insurance
companies, money market and mutual funds all opting for different areas of
the yield curve.
Yield spreads have reached historically tight levels, with weaker credits
performing relatively better than stronger credits, reflecting strong
appetite for higher-yielding paper. Investors are becoming increasingly
comfortable with corporate debt as the US economy emerges from recession,
while the process of de-leveraging since the end of the 1980s has improved
the credit profile of corporate America. The fresh availability of equity
funding has allowed companies to rebuild their capital bases.
US institutions are also extremely sophisticated in their assessment of
credit risk, often boasting their own credit research capacity. The nuances
between different companies with the same credit rating have become
increasingly pronounced.
There has also been a growing distinction between cyclical and non-cyclical
companies. Since the start of the year, bond yields of non-cyclical
companies have tightened about 10 basis points, while those of companies in
cyclical industries have performed even better, partly as a reversal of
their underperformance last year.
US companies rated Triple-B, which would not even be able to gain access to
the public debt markets in many countries, can raise 10-year debt in the US
corporate bond market at little more than 100 basis points (1 per cent)
above the comparable US Treasury yield.
This year, US companies have consistently been able to raise funds more
cheaply in the US corporate bond market than in the Eurodollar bond market,
even though underwriting fees in the Eurobond market are substantially
lower.
The fall-off in continental European investors willing to pay a premium for
household company names, and shifting views on the dollar, have contributed
to the Eurobond market's inability to compete with rates offered in the US
domestic market. Rather than US companies borrowing in Europe, the trend is
likely to be the reverse.
As a result, some European companies may find funding opportunities in the
US increasingly attractive. While top-rated European companies, such as
British Telecom, still command a premium in the Eurodollar bond market, some
lower-rated borrowers may find the US market more receptive. For example, a
number of European banks are currently preparing to raise subordinated debt
in the Yankee bond market (the US market for foreign borrowers).
Subordinated debt is highly prized by banks, since it counts as capital
under Basle guidelines. However, European banks have found subordinated debt
hard, or prohibitively expensive, to raise in their own markets.

FT  11 MAY 92 / International Capital Markets: Coming in the 1990s: capital
famine
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY HARRIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DR HENRY Kaufman's departure from Salomon Brothers ended an era in the US
bond markets for both of them. Salomon no longer dominates bond trading as
it did, and Dr Doom no longer dominates sentiment. But he is still the same
man, and worth close attention on the much rarer occasions when he goes
public. His Walter Surrey memorial lecture* in Washington this month was as
weighty as ever; but for the first time I can remember, it provokes me to
cavil as well as to nod.
Kaufman tries to combine two theses: that our capital markets have a bad
hangover after the excesses of the 1980s; and that the world demand for
capital is so high that real interest rates will be high for the indefinite
future. Familiar stuff, you may think; but can both scenarios be true?
Can we have austerity and an investment boom at the same time? Hardly. If,
as Kaufman argues, the western banking system is far too shaky to finance
much-needed development in the emerging Latin American economies and the
reconstruction of the ex-communist world, can we meet their demands at all?
Or will they conclude, as Stalin did 70 years ago, that it has to be a
bootstraps operation, or nothing? Judge these questions for yourself in the
light of the Kaufman analysis.
On banking he is, as usual, grimly convincing. Deregulation, he says, has
left behind 'an amalgam of sophisticated financial processes and badly
understood and frequently immeasurable risks'. The measurable risks are
those resulting from fee-driven lending follies. We tend to shut our eyes to
these horrors; Kaufman's estimate that unpaid interest alone currently
amounts to Dollars 25bn gives an idea of their scale. The immeasurable risks
are partly in over-valued property, but especially in derivatives. One
startling example: he estimates currently outstanding interest rate swaps at
Dollars 3,000bn. 'I can think of no area that has the potential for creating
greater havoc.' Enough said.
The British clearing banks have recent experience of what he calls the
'significant submerged risks' which may be involved in swaps. He also points
out an economic cost which is generally overlooked. Borrowers who swap into
fixed coupon obligations get no benefit from falling market interest rates.
This helps to explain why the economic response to cuts has been so
disappointing. And it is an important pointer for equity analysts; company
accounts are unhelpful about the terms on which money is owed.
Meanwhile, the supervisory authorities are in almost equally bad shape.
Kaufman is unmerciful: regulators have habitually missed the point of
innovations such as CDs, junk bonds, derivatives, and so been unprepared for
the side-effects, some of which they still fail to understand. Generally
they have been reactive; too little and too late.
They have protected market imperfections, because these make regulation
easier, and so encouraged the innovations they do not understand. When
provoked to act, they have been too timid; and they have been backed by
politicians, who like easy credit. (This suggests a supervisory argument for
central bank independence which is surely more powerful than the usual
monetarist case.) Most important, potentially, they have yet to set up a
system of international responsibility which could handle a future BCCI.
Kaufman concludes that there is no more outstanding debt, private and
public, than the system can handle. The banks will be highly conservative
for years to come; governments will be deflating (preferably through defence
cuts); and both investment and debt reduction demand a return to basic
reliance on equity financing. Especially for new borrowers.
But if you accept this, as I do, can you argue plausibly for a boom, even in
developed economies, or even simply in equity markets? It seems more likely
that for some time any borrower other than an established giant is going to
find it next to impossible to finance even promising projects. Even the
credit-worthy will practice what Kaufman call 'capital frugality'; for the
rest, it looks more like capital famine.

FT  11 MAY 92 / UK Gilts: Dealers adjust to rush of new issues
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GILT PRICES dipped at the long end, as the market adjusted to a rush of new
gilt issues and last week's expected cut in UK base rates.
However, with few indications that significant inflationary pressures will
reappear over the next few months, the fundamental outlook for the
securities appears strong.
The gilt market will focus over the next few days on a spate of economic
data related to the UK, in particular on inflation.
The most frequently used measure of headline inflation is expected to show
an increase for last month. However, other ways of examining price rises
indicate that demand levels in the economy remain weak, in a conclusion that
should sustain buying interest in gilts.
Some gilt analysts disagree with this conclusion, pointing to relatively
high increases in average earnings across the economy in recent months.
Another worry for some economists is the high level of inflation as measured
by the prices of services, in contrast to those of merchandise goods.
However, last week concern on this score appeared muted. The main reason for
the general softness in gilt prices was the effects felt by the market in
digesting roughly Pounds 9.5bn worth of gilts issued by the Bank of England
over the past five weeks.
However, indicating some investors' preoccupation with inflation, the
index-linked sector of the gilt market performed well. The 2 1/2 per cent
index-linked stock payable in 2016 saw a yield drop of 17 basis points (0.17
percentage points), with the bond yielding 4.55 per cent on Friday night.
The overall lure of gilts to many investors was underlined by last week's
absorption by the market of Pounds 1bn worth of gilts, made available by the
Bank on Tuesday. That took the form of a Pounds 800m tranche of 8 3/4 per
cent Treasury bonds maturing in 1997, and Pounds 200m of 2 1/2 per cent
index linked stock payable in 2013.
The Bank is also issuing today a further Pounds 200m of index-linked gilts,
in the form of two equal tranches of 2 1/2 per cent Treasury stock. One of
these tranches is due in 2011 and available at a price of 134 1/16 , and the
second matures in 2016 and is being priced at 117 1/2 .
Last week's cut in bank base rates - from 10.5 to 10 per cent - was well
flagged in advance by the Bank. It led to a small fall in yields at the
shorter end of the yield curve, while gilts with maturities beyond the
5-year range base experienced a yield increase of about 3 basis points, with
a corresponding small fall in prices.
As for inflation, attention will focus on the Central Statistical Office's
release on Friday of the rise in the retail prices index in the year to
April. This is expected to be some 4.4 per cent, as compared with 4 per cent
in March.
Much of the likely increase, however, can be explained by technical factors
related to distortions in the RPI as measured in April 1991. According to an
index constructed by Greenwell Montagu, underlying inflation, stripping out
factors such as seasonal food and other distorting influences, is likely to
measure 5.1 per cent in April, as opposed to 5.5 per cent in March.
The gilt market will also fix its eyes on Thursday's figure for the
underlying rise in average earnings across the economy in the year to March.
There will be some disappointment if the figure fails to come down from
February's 7.25 per cent year-on-year level.

FT  11 MAY 92 / European Bonds: UK and French easing test accepted ERM
wisdoms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LAST week tested some accepted truths about the behaviour of European bond
markets in the exchange rate mechanism. The UK and French governments both
managed to ease monetary policy despite continued pressure for higher rates
in Germany.
Admitedly, the UK gilts market was rather churlish in response to Tuesday's
 1/2 -point cut in UK base lending rates. Bond prices fell by a similar  1/2
 point on the day at the 10-year maturity as investors took profits.
The French market was kinder to it's government, which reduced the reserve
requirements imposed on banks, also allowing them to cut base lending rates
by  1/2 -point. Bond yields at the 10-year maturity were 8.61 per cent by
the close on Friday, from 8.75 per cent at the start of the week.
Both governments were able to engineer an easing of monetary conditions
without sending shock waves through the bond or foreign exchange markets.
Despite the initial bout of selling, gilts prices and sterling closed higher
on the week. The French franc remained comfortably within its ERM limits.
This seems to contradict the received wisdom that Germany now sets interest
rates for the rest of Europe. There was certainly little prospect of Germany
cutting interest rates last week.
the Bundesbank's key measures, is running well above the target range.
Consumer price inflation may have peaked, but it will only decline slowly
from here on. The latest round of wage settlements are higher than the
authorities would like to see.
Indeed, there were sighs of relief on Thursday when the Bundesbank council
opted not to raise rates.
Analysts warn against reading too much into the events of last week and
buying into French OATs and UK gilts on expectations of sharply lower rates
and bond yields.
The consensus among economists was that the French and UK last week
exhausted any leeway they had to ease monetary policy and push bond prices
higher.
Little wonder that the French prime minister, and former long-serving
finance minister, Mr Pierre Beregovoy, opted not to sanction a cut in the
Bank of France money market intervention rate - the most direct method of
easing monetary conditions. By reducing reserve requirements, he helped to
cut the cost of credit in France's sluggish economy, yet kept money market
conditions fairly tight.
Last year, Mr Beregovoy was caught cutting the intervention rate before the
markets thought such a move was justified. Rates were promptly put back up.
He was clearly keen not to repeat the experience.
This realism may also explain the muted reaction of the gilts market to last
week's cut in rates. Many economists forecast just one more cut in UK
interest rates before the year end. This is reflected in the UK money
markets, where interbank funds are changing hands a shade above the new 10
per cent base lending rate at all maturities.
On a more positive note, European bond yields do not look to be moving any
higher. Investors appear unwilling to push German 10-year bund yields above
8 per cent. French 10-year yields now appear to have retreated decisively
from the 8.75 per cent level tested in March and April.

FT  11 MAY 92 / European Bonds: Portuguese paper loses its shine
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AMONG the higher-yielding European bond markets, Portugal has been the clear
winner over the past month. But the shine on escudo bonds has become
tarnished in the past fortnight, and may lose further lustre in the weeks
ahead, writes Richard Waters.
The rush by international investors into Portuguese bonds at the start of
April, prompted by escudo's entry into the exchange rate mechanism of the
EMS on the wide band, wiped nearly 1 percentage point off the gross yield on
five-year, fixed-rate bonds. Although there were plenty of people predicting
Portugal's ERM entry at the end of its six-month presidency of the EC, it
did not stop the rush.
Since the middle of April, however, things have been different. The 12.5 per
cent gross yield on five-year bonds has widened to around 12.75 per cent as
the initial excitement has eased. International investors are banned from
buying higher-yielding floating-rate paper, a ruling introduced last summer
and extended this year to keep international speculators out of the market.
The yield could be set to rise further: after the 20 per cent withholding
tax, the current net yield is close to the 10.88 per cent available on
10-year Spanish bonds. Should the latest figures from Spain show inflation
much below 7 per cent, investment in Portugal will begin to look expensive.

FT  11 MAY 92 / US Money and Credit: Jobs surprise may put Fed action on
hold
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN FRIEDMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Treasury bond market's hopes of another easing in monetary policy by the
Federal Reserve seem to have been put on temporary hold as a result of
better-than-expected jobs figures for April.
However, judging by the market's ability to shrug off ultimately the news
that some 126,000 non-farm jobs were created in April, it would appear that
traders still think a quarter-point cut in the Fed funds target is likely,
possibly in the early part of June.
Trading was extremely volatile on Friday, as the market absorbed the news of
a tiny drop in the unemployment rate, from 7.3 to 7.2 per cent, looked more
closely at the figures, remembered the weakness of money supply, and then
rallied.
The market had been in a reasonable mood last week as some Dollars 36bn of
quarterly refunding went well. The weakening of money supply figures,
including a Dollars 9.7bn drop in M-2 for the week ended April 27, also
encouraged investors, who believed a rate cut by the Fed was around the
corner.
It was in this environment that the initial reaction to the new jobs figures
was a brief mark down, especially as a Federal Reserve staffer was quoted as
telling Market News that a further Fed easing was now unlikely 'since the
economy is expanding'.
Yet Ms Maria Ramirez, the capital markets analyst, pointed out that 75 per
cent of the 126,000 increase in jobs were temporary service sector positions
that, in any case, tend to be over-estimated. Only 8,000 of the new jobs
were in manufacturing, hardly an indication of a boom, or even of a rosy
recovery.
The bottom line, as the bond watchers at Salomon Brothers noted, is that the
jobs data, while stronger than expected, will not challenge the 7 3/4 per
cent to 8 1/8 per cent trading range in which bonds have lingered for the
past three months.
The pace of expansion should remain moderate, keeping the bond market
deadlocked in this trading range, Salomon said.
The yield curve also remains extremely steep, with about 300 basis points
separating two-year notes and the benchmark 30-year bonds. The 30-year paper
was yielding 7.89 per cent on Friday, which represented a rally of nearly
one point on the day.
Looking ahead, some economists are arguing - and presumably many in the bond
market agree - that the Fed will want to do more to stimulate bank lending
and perhaps money supply growth as well. The so-called credit crunch is
meant to be tapering off, and there have been encouraging signs that
regional bank lending is growing much more than the sluggish 1 per cent
average annual rise in loans for all banks.
Inflation should not be a worry for the Fed, according to most analysts. The
forecasts for next week suggest a rise in the April producer price index
(PPI), of 0.2 to 0.3 per cent, and in the consumer price index (CPI), of 0.1
to 0.3 per cent.
By the same token, expectations for April retail sales - a decline of
between 0.1 and 0.5 per cent - also point to an economic environment that
could well be conducive to a rate cut by the Fed.
The jobs data may have, therefore, been more a flicker of hope - especially
for those politicians wishing to portray America in solid recovery - than a
decisive trend-setter. It's still a near-sighted market.

FT  11 MAY 92 / International Company News: Turkey ready to court world's
banks again
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TURKEY is preparing to turn back to international banks for cash for the
first time since a disastrous attempt to raise Dollars 200m foundered last
year.
Last year, banks were offered a loan margin of 90 basis points (0.9
percentage point) over the London interbank offered rate (Libor). 'It was at
least 40 basis points too cheap at the time,' one banker said last week.
As a result, the republic is expected to have to pay significantly more to
guarantee a successful deal this time around. It has retained a group of
banks to lead the deal, among them JP Morgan and Citibank, which will reach
agreement on the pricing of the loan by consensus.
Only last week, Turkey offered the equivalent of around 1.8 percentage point
over Libor to investors in its first issue of Ecu in the Eurobond market.
Bankers said it would probably have to pay even more than that to attract
banks to lend it money, given the perceived greater liquidity of bonds
compared with bank loans.
Turkey last week narrowly succeeded in achieving investment-grade status
when it was awarded a BBB rating from the two leading US rating agencies,
Standard &amp; Poor's and Moody's.

GENERAL ELECTRIC Capital of the US has paid Dollars 126m for a 1.85 per cent
stake in Banco Bilbao Vizcaya (BBV), Spain's most powerful commercial bank.
The acquisition is part of a wide-ranging strategic deal which will allow
BBV entry into a number of GE Capital's UK credit operations.
In a weekend agreement that finally brought to fruition an idea launched in
July, GE Capital has also paid Dollars 24m for 45 per cent of BBV's leasing
arm, Finanzia. The Spanish bank, in turn, has paid Dollars 12m for 9.9 per
cent of three GE Capital affiliates in the UK: First Personal Bank, First
Personal Insurance and First Personal Insurance Brokers.
The deal makes GE Capital the second largest single shareholder in BBV after
the Japanese insurer, Nippon Life, with 2 per cent. The US group intends to
use its arrangements with BBV to spearhead a drive into the Spanish and
Portuguese markets in leasing and private credit cards, in which it is the
world leader.
GE Capital's UK affiliates control a number of prestigious credit card
operations, including Harrods and Burtons and, with Finanzia, the two groups
plan to create similar business among large Iberian chains. With the entry
of GE Capital, Finanzia also plans to enter into project finance - although
its objectives still remain undefined - and property finance.
BBV has also spent Dollars 20m buying 20 per cent of GE Capital Corporation
of Puerto Rico, where it recently also took over Royal Bank of Canada's
banking business. Most Spanish banks have now established a strong presence
in Puerto Rico, regarded as a key element in developing offshore business
from the US.

MORGAN STANLEY, the US broker, was fined Dollars 36m on charges by the state
of West Virginia that it was responsible for trades that lost millions of
dollars from the state's investment fund in 1987, Reuter reports from
Charleston.
A spokeswoman for the firm said it planned to appeal. 'We expect it to be
overturned on appeal,' she said.
West Virginia sued Morgan Stanley over about Dollars 40m lost in three deals
in which the firm was involved in 1987. Judge Andrew MacQueen had ruled it
owed the state Dollars 32m from those trades, leaving the jury to rule on
whether Morgan Stanley was guilty of fraud.
The spokeswoman said the West Virginia Consolidated Fund, involved in the
transactions, realised gains of more than Dollars 500m during the period in
question, even as it was losing the Dollars 32m.
Judge MacQueen had ruled before the trial opened that those trades violated
the Consolidated Fund's guidelines.

FT  11 MAY 92 / International Company News: Taking a provincial telecom into
the world market / A look at Bell Canada's strategy for expanding beyond
providing local telephone services
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Jean Monty, Bell Canada's chairman, is determined to prove that a
medium-sized telephone company can expand and prosper among the giants of
the international telecommunications industry.
What it takes, he says, is a careful assessment of strengths and weaknesses.
Bell is Canada's biggest telephone company, with revenues exceeding CDollars
7bn (USDollars 5.8bn) year, profits of almost a CDollars 1bn in 1991 and
over 54,000 employees. Its parent, BCE, also owns 53 per cent of Northern
Telecom, the telephone equipment supplier. Bell-Northern Research, jointly
owned by Bell and Northern Telecom, is Canada's biggest privately-owned R&amp;D
establishment.
Mr Monty recognises that Bell has its limitations in trying to compete with
such behemoths at AT&amp;T, British Telecom and NTT. 'You can't go after an
elephant by punching him on the nose,' he says.
Although Bell's basic telephone business remains confined to the provinces
of Ontario and Quebec, it has recently moved to deepen and broaden its
business.
A consortium led by Bell last month bought the Canadian government's
controlling interest in Telesat Canada, which owns and operates the
country's commercial satellite network.
A reorganisation of Telecom Canada, the domestic long-distance monopoly
owned by the nine provincial phone companies, has left Bell as the most
powerful shareholder.
Telecom Canada has been renamed Stentor. A senior Bell executive has taken
over as president of Stentor Resource Centre, a subsidiary in which the
shareholders will pool their national marketing and engineering resources.
BCE, clearly acting as Bell's stalking horse, has acquired a 60 per cent
stake and forged a close working partnership with SHL Systemhouse, a
data-systems integrator with interests in Canada, the US and Britain.
Bell is also trying to find a way of getting more leverage out of the 22 per
cent stake which BCE has in Teleglobe Canada, the company which provides all
Canada's overseas telephone services.
A common thread through all these moves is Bell's effort to gain a
springboard into the US, from where much of the competition in the Canadian
telephone market originates.
Mr Monty says Bell plans to step up pressure on Teleglobe to bring down its
overseas rates to attract international traffic from US businesses. The
alternative, he warns, is for Bell to do a deal with a US company which
would bypass Teleglobe.
Two of Telesat Canada's satellites have a 'footprint' which extends almost
to the Mexican border. 'There will be 'open skies' in the satellite business
in North America,' Mr Monty says.
Mr Frank Koelsch, a Toronto telecommunications consultant, concludes: 'Bell
is trying to put together a very powerful organisation while they still have
the strength to do it.' A government proposal to limit foreign ownership of
any telecommunications common carrier to 20 per cent will also benefit Bell.
Much of Bell's most profitable business is threatened by intensifying
competition. While the provincial telephone companies continue to be closely
regulated by the government, the market for those who 'resell' or share
phone services has become a virtual free-for-all.
The bulk of the business previously reserved for Canadian utilities is going
to the US. With the help of cut-price resellers, for instance, many Canadian
businesses now route their long-distance calls through the US. Some have
even moved their data centres south of the border.
The resellers, who buy phone connections at wholesale prices from the
telephone companies and then 'resell' to big users, have gained a 6 per cent
share of Canadian long-distance traffic in the past two years. Bell expects
their share to climb to over 10 per cent by 1994. Britain's Cable &amp; Wireless
has been among the most successful in penetrating the reseller market in
Canada.
Bell is also facing a domestic challenge. Within the next few weeks, the
Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission is expected to
open the door for the first time to competition in domestic long-distance
service.
Unitel Communications, a joint venture between Canadian Pacific, the
transport conglomerate, and Rogers Communications, the country's biggest
cable-TV operator, has been fighting for almost a decade to break the
long-distance monopoly held by Telecom Canada.
The problem for Bell and the other provincial phone companies is that,
although they have halved long-distance charges in the past four years,
these calls still provide a huge subsidy to cheap local services.
All local calls in Canada are free. Although any change would be political
dynamite, Mr Monty is hoping that regulators will allow the phone companies
to start charging for ultra-heavy users, such as the tele-marketing
companies which use computerised dialling machines.
Bell has also argued that if Unitel is allowed to compete for lucrative
long-distance traffic, it should make a contribution towards the cost of
maintaining free local calls. Bell has threatened to cut its investment in
local services if Unitel is given an unfair advantage in the long-distance
market.
The bottom line for Bell and the other provincial utilities, however, is
that they must move fast to bring down costs and improve services.
Bell recently accelerated the conversion of its local network to digital
equipment. The work is now due for completion by 1994, three years earlier
than planned.
A digital network allows the phone companies to offer lucrative value-added
features to subsidise the cheap basic service. Among the newest features is
one which allows a household telephone to be used as an answering machine.
Bell can also programme one telephone to ring in several different tones,
depending on which member of a family is being called.

FT  11 MAY 92 / International Company News: Annual net losses at Pirelli
Tyre grow to Fl 511m
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PIRELLI Tyre Holding, the Dutch-listed tyre-making arm of Italy's Pirelli
group, saw annual net losses widen to Fl 511m (Dollars 275m) in 1991 from
just Fl 9m in 1990.
The downturn was caused by difficult conditions on most world tyre markets,
reorganisation costs in Europe and the US, and a downwards revision in the
market value of Pirelli Tyre's 5 per cent stake in Continental, its German
rival and one-time takeover target.
Pirelli Tyre, which is to omit its dividend for the second year running,
said it expected results to reach break-even point during 1992. However, it
said it could not say whether this would happen early enough to pull the
company out of the red for the full year.
Mr Guiseppe Ferrari, finance director, said Pirelli Tyre, which is 80 per
cent-owned by the Pirelli group, had made some headway in the 1992 first
quarter. 'So far, the results are encouraging, showing that we are improving
the situation compared with last year.'
In November and December, the company pushed through price increases on the
car-tyre replacement markets in Europe and North America, and followed this
up in May with rises for truck and agricultural equipment tyres in both
these regions.
Sales of 'original equipment' tyres to automotive producers fell in 1991 as
a result of sluggish car sales. Overall, Pirelli Tyre's sales eased to Fl
6.1bn last year from Fl 6.2bn in 1990.
Of last year's loss, slightly more than Fl 200m represented losses on normal
business operations, particularly in the US, while a further Fl 250m was set
aside for restructuring provisions. At the same time, the value of the
company's holding in Continental was revised downwards by more than Fl 40m.
The stake, originally seen as a strategic asset in Pirelli's attempt to
merge with Continental, is now regarded as a financial asset. Mr Ferrari
said the recovery in the tyre industry may, in the medium term, enable
Pirelli to recoup some of the costs of its investment.

FT  11 MAY 92 / International Company News: An improving performance that
lifted everyone's tails - The much happier frame of mind at Glasgow-based
Murray Johnstone
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FIFTEEN months ago Murray Johnstone, the Glasgow-based fund management
company, presented an unhappy spectacle.
It had been forced to admit failure in its attempt to find a partner who
would buy part or all of the company and help it move into a bigger league
among fund managers.
Even allowing for the uncertainty then prevailing because of the Gulf war,
the company was not presenting either a confident or coherent picture of
where it intended to go next. Mr Nick McAndrew, the managing director, was
then fidgety and gloomy as he expounded the situation.
Now Mr McAndrew, a 57-year-old former managing director of NM Rothschild, is
cheerful and positive as he ticks off a list of recent successes for Murray
Johnstone. For example, whereas in February 1991 he was lamenting that the
Dollars 230m (Pounds 130m) under management by Murray Johnstone
International, its US-based subsidiary, was too little to be profitable,
today MJI is announcing a jump of Dollars 150m in its funds under management
taking them to Dollars 550m.
Looking back, he says: 'The six months we spent looking for a partner in the
second half of 1990 helped us decide what we wanted to do and we then set
out to do it.'
That meant tightening up the management of the different sectors of the
business and giving them a clearer focus. A number of senior executives left
and coupled with the arrival of a new computer system Murray Johnstone's
payroll fell from 300 to about 250.
The core of Murray Johnstone is its pension fund management business which,
including MJI, accounts for half the Pounds 3.4bn it has under management.
Then there are its investment trusts, accounting for Pounds 900m. The four
main ones, led by Murray International Trust, between them own 70 per cent
of the fund management company. There are also exempt funds and unit trusts,
as well as a venture capital operation, and a personal asset management
business.
It was partly the weakness of the pension fund management business which led
to the loss of self-confidence which inspired Murray Johnstone to put itself
on the market in mid-1990 - an initiative that was disastrously timed
because it was almost immediately followed by Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.
Poor pension fund performance since 1987 had caused the departure of a
series of pension fund clients.
In the summer of 1990 Mr McAndrew brought in Mr Giles Weaver as investment
director from London, where he had successfully run Prudential's pension
business. He began reorganising the UK pension fund business, both by
improving communications with pension fund consultants and trustees, and by
re-positioning the different funds in the market.
'The advantage of Giles Weaver was that being new to Murray Johnstone he
didn't have friends there. So he could make unpleasant decisions very
quickly,' says someone at a rival fund management house.
Yet between 1990 and 1991 the value of pension funds under management fell
by four per cent and the number of clients dropped from 43 to 34. Although
the performance of the funds has improved substantially over that period
Murray Johnstone's pension business is suffering from two problems.
First, there is almost always a time-lag in the pension management business
between a fund manager's performance improving and new clients being
recruited. This is because the consultants who advise pension fund trustees
look at the five-year record rather than the short term performance and for
Murray Johnstone this record is still cloudy.
Secondly, a number of clients were lost because some funds under management
were reorganised or reassessed following the takeover or merger of the
companies they served. Unfortunately for Mr Weaver this process could not be
disguised because new clients were not being taken on.
'We're marking time,' says Mr Weaver. 'Because of the way the business works
it could be a year before we start winning new business on a large scale.'
In other parts of Murray Johnstone, success is more obvious. In investment
trusts the company last year successfully launched a new trust, Murray Split
Capital, and recently won a beauty parade to manage the European Project
Investment Trust.
The four main investment trusts recently won a collection of awards from
Micropal, the performance analysis concern, for investment performance over
the past ten years.
Murray Johnstone's relatively small unit trust sector, which Mr Richard
Elliott Lockhart was recruited last autumn from Mercury Asset Management to
reorganise, pulled off a coup in February by being the first unit trust
manager to cut initial charges from five to one per cent. Since then more
than 6,000 inquiries have come in and many have been converted into sales.
The venture capital sector is now closing its leveraged buy-out fund having
used up almost all the Dollars 100m raised - it made Pounds 17.7m with the
flotation of Burn Stewart, a whisky company in which itn invested Pounds
1.5m in 1988 - and is now launching a new fund, the MJ Private Acquisition
Partnership, hoping to raise Pounds 100m. Mr Geoff Burns who is in charge
believes there will be several new opportunities for management buy-outs and
buy-ins in the next few years and notes that several venture capital players
have left the market.
Mr Weaver has a simple explanation for the buoyant mood which is evident
among senior executives at Murray Johnstone. 'It's all down to performance.
When your investments are doing well it just lifts everyone's tails.'
The company decided the Conservatives would win the general election and
invested heavily in the UK market accordingly. 'We had sleepless nights for
a bit but it all came out right in the end.'

FT  11 MAY 92 / International Company News: Maddox poised to make its first
UK acquisition
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR HUGO BIERMANN'S recently listed Maddox group is expected to confirm this
week that it is on the verge of making its first UK acquisition and is
planning several more.
The South African-born entrepreneur, who made a small fortune in 1989
selling the mini-conglomerate Thomson T-Line to Ladbrokes for Pounds 186m,
three years after buying it for Pounds 800,000, is at an advanced stage of
talks to acquire a privately-owned cable systems company for around Pounds
15m.
The move will refocus Maddox from a pure distributor of wire and cable by
adding the servicing and maintainence of electrical wiring systems.
Mr Biermann is both chairman and largest shareholder of Maddox in which he
has raised his stake to 26 per cent. He hopes to buy more privately owned
companies over the next six months.
Mr Biermann has a reputation as a shrewd deal maker, but has been criticised
in the past for lacking the managerial back up to run the companies bought.
To try and answer that criticism Mr Biermann has recruited Mr Nigel Smith
from Ladbroke as group managing director. He was installed as MD in Thomson
T-line when Ladbroke acquired the mini-conglomerate in 1989.
Maddox, which acquired its listing in March, has two main businesses, Cables
and Flexibles, a UK distributor which Mr Biermann bought back from Ladbrokes
last year, and Seacoast Electrical Corporation in the US. The group has
decided to expand its UK business first.
Mr Biermann believes the liberalisation of telecommunications will offer his
company further opportunities in laying cables for new competitors to BT in
the UK, while simultaneously expanding on the continent.
Cables and Flexibles recently bought a UK company, Cablelink, whose Belgian
subsidiary has won orders with several telephone companies in the Benelux
installing cable systems.

BAA, the airport company, has announced plans to build a Pounds 60m
operations centre for British Airways at Heathrow.
BA has agreed to pay an annual rent of Pounds 5.2m on the 200,000 sq ft
building, which will be completed in early 1994. The project, which will
cost Pounds 45m to build, will be handled by Lynton, BAA's development arm.
This is one of the largest pre-let property deals in the UK in the last two
years.
The new development will stand on a 10 acre site on the north side of the
airport. The three-storey building with a curved glass facade has been
designed by Nicholas Grimshaw &amp; Partners, architects.
BA believes that the new building, which will replace 7 separate buildings,
will save it Pounds 1m a year.
BA's move will allow BAA to make better use of its central terminal
buildings.
Last year, BAA completed a 170,000 sq ft catering base for BA on the south
side of the airport, which was also pre-let.

fourth largest export market after France, Italy and the US.
Mr Tony Gledhill, marketing director, said Church Japan would involve Otsuka

FT  11 MAY 92 / Midland complains to Bank over leak
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BARCHARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MIDLAND BANK has complained to the Bank of England that its business could
be seriously damaged by the tactics being used by Lloyds Bank in its
takeover battle for the UK clearer.
However, the Bank is thought unlikely to intervene. It is anxious to remain
strictly neutral in what is becoming an increasingly heated battle between
two of the UK's top banks.
Midland claims that Lloyds is raising fears that Chinese control of Hong
Kong after 1997 could have a seriously damaging effect on the Midland bank
business, should the rival bid from Hongkong Bank succeed.
Midland's alarm follows the appearance in newspapers over the weekend of
parts of an early draft of a submission by Lloyds to the Office of Fair
Trading.
Senior officials at Midland, including Mr Brian Pearse, chief executive, are
convinced that the leak was deliberate.
'Our concern is not so much with the tactic of leaking - which we are
accustomed to from Lloyds - but the scurrilous nature of what they are
leaking,' Midland Bank said last night.
The leaks have stiffened the determination of Midland's board not to
disclose confidential commercial information to Lloyds Bank which has
already been supplied to Hongkong Bank.
The issue will be considered by the Takeover Panel in the middle of this
week.
Midland argues that the two cases are quite different since Hongkong Bank
has already put in its bid and is a 15 per cent shareholder, while Lloyds is
a direct competitor.
Last night Lloyds strongly denied that it had leaked any information to the
press or that it was running a dirty campaign to destabilise Midland.
'We have apologised for the leak and it certainly didn't come from us, since
it does us serious harm. We are at least as annoyed about it as Midland is,'
a Lloyds spokesman said.
Midland is understood to have been particularly upset by implications in the
leaked material that it might need fresh capital after the merger. 'We are
more strongly capitalised than Lloyds,' a Midland spokesman said.
He accused Lloyds of skirting over UK competition issues by stressing in its
draft submission the possible problems of Hongkong Bank after Hong Kong
returns to China in 1997.

FT  11 MAY 92 / Economics Notebook: Policymakers take a long hard look at
Emu
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Community's economic and finance ministers have just spent the
weekend in Oporto, Portugal, discussing growth, budgets and employment in
the EC.
But although they heard a progress report on moves towards economic and
monetary union, there was no critical evaluation of the EC's blueprint for
Emu and the implications that it might have for the economic well-being of
the community. This is a pity, because, five months on from last December's
Maastricht summit, the EC's Emu treaty is coming under increasingly
sceptical scrutiny among policy makers and analysts.
Interest in the possible negative consequences of Maastricht is also growing
on the other side of the Atlantic. Indeed, the US administration may yet use
perceived defects in the treaty to reinforce its criticism of Europe's slow
growth at the Group of Seven world economic summit in Munich in early July.
Last week, Mr Erik Hoffmeyer, the Danish central bank governor and current
chairman of the EC central bank governors' committee, lifted the lid on some
worries about Emu preoccupying EC policy makers.
The Emu provisions of the Maastricht treaty were, he said, 'weaker than
appropriate'. Giving the City University Business School's prestigous Mais
lecture, Mr Hoffmeyer specifically criticised the skewed relationship
between monetary policy making, which under Emu will be handled by an
independent European central bank, and fiscal policy, which will remain the
responsibility of 12 national decision making units.
Similar worries have been expressed by Professor Peter Kenen of Princeton
University in a paper* just published by the Group of Thirty, the
Washington-based think-tank of eminent persons from finance, business,
policy making and academia around the world.
The Maastricht blueprint, says Professor Kenen, is 'imperfect and
incomplete'. The fiscal provisions are too narrow, and pay insufficient
attention to the need for the Community to fashion a suitable fiscal stance
for Europe as a whole. In addition, he argues that the mandate of the
planned European central bank is too restricted and that it should be
involved in prudential supervision to safeguard the stability of the EC's
financial system.
He observed the Emu negotiations at first hand while holding a six-month
Bank of England fellowship. His criticisms therefore have some claim to be
taken seriously. He is also concerned that:
Greece, Italy and Portugal could face real problems meeting the economic
convergence requirements for Emu.
Emu could make it harder for the G7 countries to agree policies affecting
exchange rates, so leading to volatility in exchange rates between Europe,
the US and Japan.
The preconditions for joining Emu that relate to exchange rates and
long-term interest rates are of little practical use, and
There could be problems before the new Europe central bank establishes its
counter inflationary credibility.
This latter point worries the US Treasury. Mr David Mulford, the US Treasury
under-secretary for international affairs, has spoken of a 'possible bias'
in the Emu treaty that 'might mean a highly conservative stance on growth
policies over a period of time'.
Translated, this means that the US Treasury fears that the monetary
institutions set up in the third and final stage of Emu will have to be
'more German than the Germans' and push up interest rates more than would be
the case under current rules to establish credibility with the financial
markets.
The unequal responsibilities put on monetary and fiscal policy under Emu
raise two dangers. On the one hand, Emu, once established, might need to be
propped up by unnecessarily high interest rates and so have a deflationary
bias. Alternatively, Emu, shackled with such inefficiencies, would be less
capable of delivering price stability than the exchange rate mechanism of
the EMS.
Both are worrying possibilities, which will have to be addressed by EC
finance ministers before too long.
Inflation fears
Virtually all market pundits are expecting Britain's annual inflation rate
will move upwards from March's 4 per cent rate when the retail prices index
for April is published on Friday.
But some are now warning that the rise will be more than a blip and that Mr
John Major's boast of last year that inflation in Britain was 'licked' will
turn out to have been premature.
One inflation bear is Mr Peter Warburton, chief economist of Robert Fleming,
a monetarist whose views are treated with respect by senior Treasury
officials. Mr Warburton believes that the annual rate of RPI inflation could
be 4.8 per cent on Friday (against the consensus view of 4.4 per cent) and
that inflation will then move erratically upwards to 5.6 per cent by the end
of the year and 6.2 per cent in March 1993.
Mr Warburton argues that the non-traded goods and services sectors will
experience a new inflationary upsurge once monetary policy is eased. He
believes fiscal indiscipline has stacked up inflationary pressures in the
public sector. Capacity destruction during the recession will have limited
the scope for non-inflationary growth.
Concentration of market share among a few large retailers and lack of
competition among utilities also bode ill for falling inflation. He also
believes commodity prices will be less likely to stay low, especially in the
food sector.
Admittedly, this is just one man's view and much will depend on the pace of
UK recovery. But Mr Warburton's warnings merit some attention, if only
because last week's cut in base rates to 10 per cent anticipated an uneven
decline in UK inflation to the end of the year.

FT  11 MAY 92 / EBRD brings banks into east European lending
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) has for the
first time brought in commercial banks as participants on one of its loans
to an eastern European borrower.
The Dollars 60m (Pounds 33m) loan, to Polska Telefonia Komorkowa, a Polish
joint venture set up last year to build and operate a cellular telephone
network in Poland, marks the EBRD's first success in promoting an eastern
European borrower on the international public loans market, an important
development in its aim of attracting private capital for the region.
The bank - which is looking at several more potential loans - says its
priority is to concentrate on financing joint ventures with western European
partners at first, although it hopes to encourage indigenous corporate
borrowers to tap the international loans market eventually.
This year, the bank expects to lend Ecu1bn (Pounds 700m) to eastern European
ventures, although it stresses its aim is 'to mobilise additional capital'
from commercial banks rather than merely put up its own funds.
'Our strategy is to lend to commercial projects in countries where
commercial banks are reluctant to lend,' said Ms Noreen Doyle, the
recently-appointed head of syndications at the EBRD.
She said the EBRD wants to do project-linked loans and longer-term
financings, although she warned that lending for certain projects could be
hampered by the fact that many of the eastern European countries lack the
necessary legal framework to satisfy commercial bankers. 'Project financing
requires an infrastructure which doesn't exist' in many of these countries,
she said.
The EBRD signed its Dollars 60m seven-year loan agreement with the Polish
telephone venture PTK last November, and it has now syndicated Dollars 20m
of the deal to four European banks - Credit Lyonnais, BNP and Societe
Generale of France and Internationale Nederlanden Bank (formerly NMB
Postbank).
The EBRD is conferring its 'preferred creditor status' on the deal in order
to encourage the commercial banks to participate. This means that if there
is insufficient cash to pay all creditors, the preferred creditors come
first.
Ms Doyle stressed that without the participation of the EBRD in the deal,
the four commercial banks would probably not have lent. Normally French
banks must make provisions against loans to the eastern European and
Commonwealth of Independent States, but with the EBRD as a lender, the banks
will be exempt from this condition.
PTK is a joint venture between the Polish telecommunications network
operator, France Telecom Mobiles International (a subsidiary of the French
national telephone company), and Ameritech International of the US.

FT  11 MAY 92 / Pilkington to put Pounds 40m into Polish glass plant
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON, Science Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PILKINGTON, the UK glass group, is preparing to invest Pounds 40m to help
build Poland's first float glass plant. The deal would represent one of the
largest investments so far by a foreign company in Polish industry.
Pilkington and its Polish partner, the state-owned Sandomierz glass maker,
started serious negotiations after signing a letter of intent in December
1990. The talks are now close to completion.
The UK company expects to take a stake of about 40 per cent in the venture,
which is likely to cost Pounds 100m altogether. International development
agencies, including the London-based European Bank for Reconstruction and
Development, will also make a substantial contribution.
Pilkington showed its interest in the Polish market last week when it
announced a much smaller deal to buy 45 per cent of International Glass
Poland, a sales and distribution business.
This will enable it to sell float glass imported into Poland from Pilkington
plants in western Europe, until the new factory is ready - probably in 1994.
Until now the Polish industry has used the antiquated sheet glass
manufacturing process, which has been superseded in the west by float glass
technology developed by Pilkington in the 1950s. Only float glass achieves
the quality required by the western construction and car industries.

FT  11 MAY 92 / From design studio to new car showroom / Examining the
evolution of R&amp;D at Ford Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The restructuring of Ford of Europe's research and development operations
announced last week goes to the heart of its efforts to regain a competitive
edge in the fierce battle for European car market leadership.
The US car maker's record loss in Europe in 1991 - the worst financial
performance among the big six European car makers - has been a bitter pill
for a company which led the west European car market in the mid-1980s and
which prided itself as the European industry's most efficient volume car
maker.
To revive its fortunes, Ford has launched an optimistically-titled 'drive
for leadership' campaign. High on the agenda is the implementation of
so-called 'simultaneous engineering' in the reform of product development.
Simultaneous engineering seeks to bring together design and manufacturing
engineers to work in a project team (instead of their working in sequence
and passing responsibility down the development line) so as to improve the
speed, efficiency and quality of the complex process of developing a new
vehicle.
To this end, Ford has embarked on a controversial programme to concentrate -
by the end of 1994 - all its R&amp;D activities at two sites at Dunton, Essex,
in the UK, and at Merkenich, near Cologne in Germany, in place of the
present six locations, four in the UK and two in Germany.
The plan will transfer several hundred jobs from the UK to Germany - and a
few from Germany to the UK - as Ford seeks to overcome the competitive
disadvantages of having vehicle development and engineering split between
two countries.
UK trade unions are preparing to fight the proposals, which, they claim,
will transfer core engineering skills from Britain to Germany. Ford insists
that more than half its R&amp;D effort will remain in the UK.
Much of the analysis of European and US car makers' shortcomings in the
battle against their Japanese rivals has focused on the relative efficiency
and productivity of their assembly and manufacturing plants.
Increasingly, however, attention is switching from the manufacturing process
to design, development and engineering.
'Unless we can manage more product programmes faster, at lower cost and with
lower investment, we will not be competitive,' says Mr John Oldfield, Ford
of Europe's vice-president for product programmes, vehicle engineering and
design.
Mr Oldfield's concerns are underlined by a recent study* by Mr Kim Clark and
Mr Takahiro Fujimoto, professors at the Harvard Business School and Tokyo
University, which identifies gaps in lead time and engineering productivity
between Japanese and western car makers.
The study finds that 'the average Japanese firm has almost double the
development productivity and can develop a comparable product a year faster
than the average US firm'. On average, Japanese car makers needed 1.7m
engineering hours to develop a standard car compared with 3.2m hours in the
US and 3.0m hours for a European volume car maker.
According to Mr Oldfield, US and European car makers still take up to five
years to develop a new car. 'The Japanese have about a three-year
development cycle and the best Japanese are even a little better than that.
We have started on that route. We have not yet delivered a major programme
in three years, but we now have some on the books.'
Ford has been converted to the gospel of simultaneous engineering, but it
has faced a big hurdle in matching its rivals: not only is its R&amp;D split
between the UK and Germany, but the design and manufacturing engineering has
been scattered between several plants.
'Product engineers and manufacturing engineers must be in the same country,
and ideally in the same office,' says Mr Oldfield. 'You cannot achieve
simultaneous engineering by telephone or video-conferencing.'
In the UK, Ford is planning to move 1,200 engineering staff by the end of
1994 from satellite operations at Aveley, Basildon and Dagenham to the main
R&amp;D site at Dunton, where the total workforce will be increased to about
4,500.
In Germany, some 1,300 staff are to be relocated to Merkenich, chiefly from
Ford's Niehl Cologne car plant, bringing the total at the site to 3,800.
Controversially, as part of the restructuring about 300 jobs are to be
transferred from the UK to Germany, while between 20 and 30 jobs will be
moved from Germany to the UK. MSF, the British industry and services union,
claims that another 200-400 jobs could be moved by 1994. Ford says that no
more transfers are planned.
The movement of engineers between the UK and Germany is Ford's attempt to
make the best out of a less than ideal situation. If it was starting afresh,
Ford would undoubtedly locate all its R&amp;D effort at one site in one country
to gain the full advantages of simultaneous engineering.
'If two sites are better than six why not one instead of two,' says Mr
Oldfield, posing the question that has worried the UK trade unions.
'We looked at the option of a single site, because many of our competitors
have this already,' admits Mr Oldfield, 'but it is impractical. We have too
much invested in the UK and in Germany in people, skills, experience and
facilities. We could not contemplate the cost and disruption of going to a
single site.'
Instead of the single site solution, which would have provoked an outcry
from the unions and government in the UK - or in Germany - Ford of Europe is
seeking to consolidate different areas of a vehicle's development either at
Dunton or at Merkenich.
At those sites will be gathered not only the design engineers and the
manufacturing engineers, but also the support staffs, purchasing engineers,
finance and quality control specialists.
At Merkenich, for instance, Ford is concentrating body engineering -
responsible for the body structure and all sheet metal parts - while at
Dunton the vehicle interiors will be developed including instrument panels,
mechanisms, seats, paint, trim and plastics. Basic engines will be developed
in Germany. The UK will have engine systems, performance, economy and
emissions development - and electronic engine management systems.
'After all these moves the balance of activities will still be close to
50/50 between the UK and Germany,' says Mr Oldfield, 'but we think the
balance is in favour of the UK.'
The split remains complex for a product as complicated as a motor car with
thousands of parts. 'Yes, we have compromised,' says Mr Oldfield. But the
legacy of Ford's parallel historic development in the UK and Germany could
not be overcome in any other way - yet.

FT  11 MAY 92 / Letter: Allies, not members
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr BRYAN CASSIDY MEP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Mr Anthony Kinch is wrong to claim that 'Tory members of the European
parliament are . . . joining the Christian Democrats' (Letters, May 2). We
are joining the group of the European People's party (Christian Democrats
and allies) as allies in the same way as former French president Giscard
d'Estaing has done.
While I accept that the name 'People's party' sounds odd in English ears
because of its loony left echoes, the group of the EPP, as it is generally
known in the European parliament, is the only convincing counter-balance to
the largest group in the European parliament - the Socialist Group in which
the 45 British Labour MEPs have a commanding voice.
The alliance of Conservatives with the EPP had the blessing of Mrs Thatcher
when she was leader of the Conservative party and has the blessing of Mr
Major as well. Indeed, but for his relationship with Chancellor Kohl, the
alliance could not have been sealed.
The advantage for the EPP in having 32 British and two Danish Conservatives
will be a more serious and disciplined approach. Unfortunately, the EPP has
too often been weak because its members lack discipline. Their absence from
crucial votes has, on occasion, unnecessarily handed victory to the left in
the European parliament.
Mr Kinch's suggestion that the EPP expects British Conservatives 'to stand
as Christian Democrats at the next European election in 1994' is absolute
nonsense.

FT  11 MAY 92 / Letter: Language is vital in links with Japan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr HORST G KRENZLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I read with great interest the special report (April 25) on Japanese
language and business courses organised in the UK for business executives.
We certainly share the view that participation in business-oriented
intensive language courses constitutes an efficient and vital prerequisite
for the staff of companies which intend to build and maintain long-term
commercial links with Japan. I would, therefore, like to draw your attention
to a European Community initiative which pursues the same objective and
which is open to the participation of UK companies, together with those of
other EC member states.
Launched in 1979, the Executive Training Programme consists of a 12-month
intensive Japanese language course in Tokyo followed by a six-month
placement with a Japanese company, supported by other activities, such as
seminars and plant visits. A large element of the cost of the programme is
borne by the Commission of the European Communities.
Since the ETP's inception, more than 400 executives, including 67 from the
UK, have completed the programme and more than 80 per cent of them are now
playing a key role in the management of their companies' commercial
relations with Japan.

FT  11 MAY 92 / Letter: EC must press Greece to recognise Macedonia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From VUKO TASHKOVICH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Today, Greece wants to eradicate the Macedonian name and relegate it to
the history books. Greece encompasses more territory than ever before. It
has achieved its policy of expansion by exploiting the temporary weaknesses
of its neighbours over time and annexing territories with the help of the
west. This is allegedly done in the name of 'Greek democracy'. In 1912 and
1913, both during and following the Balkan Wars, Greece seized Thessaloniki
from Turkey, annexed Crete and absorbed a large part of coastal Macedonia.
Macedonia is the name of a geographical region that belongs to all peoples.
Today, the former state falls under the national boundaries of three
different countries. To the north is the independent Republic of Macedonia
where southern Slavs have lived for 1,400 years. To the south is the
northern part of Greece and to the east live the Bulgarian-Macedonia people.
Throughout the centuries, the region of Macedonia has maintained its own
name.
The Greek government does not have a copyright on the name of Macedonia. Nor
does Greece have the right to start changing the names of other cities
around the world.
In ancient times, the Greeks did not consider Macedonia to be a part of
Greece. In 359 BC, Demosthenes, the Greek statesman, wrote his famous
anti-Macedonian speeches in which he depicted the Athenian fear of the
Macedonian kingdom and Philip II. A generation later, Alexander the Great
conquered Athens. With this historical precedent, how can Greece claim that
Macedonia belongs to it?
The Greek government, with its irrational policy toward Macedonia, has taken
advantage of the goodwill of the EC by delaying the international
recognition of this country. Internally, Greece has aroused extreme
nationalistic behaviour, closed its northern borders for commerce and
withheld vital supplies of food and medicine. I believe that Greece is
deliberately preparing the groundwork for another tragedy by creating
conditions for war such as is occurring in Croatia and Bosnia-Hercegovina.
I believe that the EC should hold the Greek government accountable for its
provocative actions. I urge the EC foreign ministers to end their
indecisiveness about the plight of the Macedonian people and their right to
self-determination.

FT  11 MAY 92 / Letter: Right place for locating EuroFed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr WAYNE D GANTT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The debate over the location of the proposed European Central Bank will
likely get nastier before it is resolved. As a visitor to the financial
centres of Europe, I see obvious reasons why the bank ought to have its
headquarters in London or Frankfurt. The other contenders are lightweight.
Either the Germans will prevail because of the sheer size of their economic
clout, or the bank could move to London to ensure even-handedness.
London would be a great choice since a German will likely be the first
chairman. This compromise would protect the integrity of the Ecu and D-Mark.
So, two points for the Germans.
Seen from across the Atlantic, London appears neutral. I cast my vote for
London as the premier European financial centre and home for the ECB.
There is another consideration. A good international bank needs a cadre of
financiers, economists and civil servants. London is presently the home of
one of the global centres of economic learning - the London School of
Economics. The LSE already supplies monetary priests to the US Fed, the Bank
of England and, probably, the Bundesbank. What better way to guarantee the
necessary human capital to assist the new bank than by placing it in the
Olympia &amp; York Canary Wharf tower and by allowing the LSE to move into
County Hall.

FT  11 MAY 92 / Letter: EC in danger of endorsing obstacle to airline
competition
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr RICHARD BRANSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Prof Doganis (Personal View, April 29) performs a valuable service by
highlighting the potential benefits of competition among airlines,
especially from new entrants.
A glimpse of the wastage which accumulates in the absence of competition was
revealed by British Airways in 1989 when, despite a remarkable sudden
productivity improvement of more than 50 per cent starting in 1979, it
admitted that it still had to charge 25 per cent more than newer British
airlines. That is a completely unnecessary burden of several million pounds
every day upon businesses and individual travellers.
Even with the benefit of fares 25 per cent higher than needed, some European
airlines need subsidising. Prof Doganis lists four. Government subsidies to
airlines are a prodigious waste of money. Immense savings in travel costs
are waiting to be realised once the barriers to competition from new
airlines are removed. But this is not happening, despite Prof Doganis'
optimistic claim that European air transport will be largely liberalised by
January 1993. Removing some old anti-competitive rules achieves little if
passengers remain captives of the same old high-cost airlines.
The principles of competition as set out in the Treaty of Rome would do the
job if applied to aviation. In particular, there is an urgent need for a
sustained systematic attack on so-called grandfather 'rights' which form a
highly effective obstacle to new airlines, especially when used to govern
access to essential facilities such as arrival and departure slots at the
airports used by most passengers. Without competitive slots, no airline can
be fully competitive, yet these privileges are currently allocated on the
irrational basis that previous possession of these profit opportunities
entitles the holder to first claim upon them, forever.
Instead of scrapping this obstacle to effective competition, the European
Commission appears to be in grave danger of endorsing it. It is to be hoped
that the imminent UK presidency will come just in time to stop this myopic
retrograde step, and instead will open real competition. When it does, it
will convert European aviation into an efficient industry, and save the
businesses, citizens and taxpayers of Europe a prodigious amount of money.

FT  11 MAY 92 / Letter: Assessment of teachers a PR gambit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr BRADLEY SWEET
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Central government has ordained that over a period of two years, all
teachers must be assessed. Similar practices in industry are held up as a
model.
I have no objection to assessment, provided it is fair and leads to positive
results. But it seems questionable whether it will work in education.
Three points concern me as a teacher in a state comprehensive school:
Given that the assessor will be a member of the school staff, it will be
difficult to ensure his or her neutrality. Areas to be assessed - such as
classroom teaching, marking, discipline, relations with parents,
administration of a department - are to be negotiated between assessor and
assessee. Thus, if I, the recipient of assessment, felt weak in any of these
categories - I might, for instance, feel weak on discipline - could
negotiate for these to be omitted. This is wrong; every aspect of the job
should be assessed.
What outcome to assessment can there be? There will be no salary increase -
a fixed scale does not allow for individual reward - and further training to
correct weaknesses is financially out of the question, as schools are
limited in their funding from the borough and from central government.
So what positive benefit can accrue from this time consuming exercise? It is
largely a public relations gambit that seems to offer little to remedy
defects in the system.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From C H ARMITAGE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Mr Nunneley, chairman of the Institutional Fund Managers' Association
(Letters, April 16) has stated that it is neither sensible nor practicable
to insure against the loss of funds in his members' care.
Having invested pension fund monies one ought to be able to expect that they
are repaid on demand plus or minus investment returns. But this is not the
case with all association members. They do not admit liability to return
monies lost other than through their own negligence.
If Mr Nunneley's members are incapable of guaranteeing the return of funds
in their care, then they should insure the risk. With the will it can be
arranged; catastrophe insurance provides cover for large sums and the loss
of pension monies is no different.
He cannot have it both ways; either his members do the job for which they
are paid and look after funds entrusted to them, or they obtain insurance
cover. But whichever, he should get on with it and stop evading the issue.

FT  11 MAY 92 / Letter: Remedy for inadequacies of UK agricultural co-ops
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr MALCOLM LYNCH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Tim Coone in his article 'Irish milkmen discover talent for butchery'
(April 14) highlights the growth of the Irish agricultural co-operative
sector and refers to their hybrid co-operative/plc structure as both an
innovative and potentially inhibiting factor in future growth.
Recent encouragement by UK ministers for farmers in the UK to establish
agricultural co-operatives, like their counterparts in many member states of
the European Community, focuses the spotlight on the inadequacies of the
Industrial and Provident Societies Acts which is the principal legislation
under which agricultural co-operatives are registered.
There have been a number of innovations in co-operative law in other
European countries in recent years. These include the issue of non-voting
shares or limited voting shares as well as financial instruments, similar to
the permanent interest bearing shares issued by building societies, which
might be traded on the stock market. Such improvements to co-operative law
also appear in the proposal for a European co-operative statute which was
issued in March 1992 by the European Commission.
If the UK government seeks to enlarge a strong agricultural co-operative
sector in the UK then it must ensure that co-operative law, in the form of
the Industrial and Provident Societies Acts, becomes a modern and effective
business medium while retaining co-operative principles. This will only
happen if the Treasury gives a clear green light to its immediate update and
to improving the resources of the Registry of Friendly Societies to examine
legislative change.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Sunday Times still can't make its mind up whether the Queen is Britain's
wealthiest person. In its latest list of Britain's 300 richest people, the
Queen comes out on top with Pounds 6.5bn. But this is in her capacity as
head of state which is pretty meaningless.
If she is counted as a private citizen, like the rest of the bunch, she
slips to number 16 in the charts, and if rival estimates in the Economist
magazine are to be believed, she would only rank as the 150th richest
person. It would make more sense if the Sunday Times did the same with the
Queen as it has done with Michael Ashcroft and Peter de Savary and dumped
her from the list to save future embarrassment.
Estimates of her wealth as just as unfathomable.

One is in the familiar A4-sized rough blue paper-covered format produced by

horrific, but I'd bet not more three ministers, if that, have read this
document - at any price'.

FT  11 MAY 92 / Observer: Solley on pools
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Whatever happened to Stephen Solley QC? He is the lawyer who represented
Victor Gray, alleged owner of the Savings and Investment Bank, the Isle of
Man's most famous collapsed bank. Gray got off as did Solley's recent
clients in the Titaghur Jute and Barlow Clowes cases. With a record like
that, and the current boom in white collar crime, surely Solley can't be
short of money?
However, last week he was complaining on TV about delays in the speed with
which barristers are paid and now Observer finds that Solley has been
moonlighting as a freelance travel writer. He has just finished a guide book
to French hotels with swimming pools.
Early days yet, but it could turn out to be the standard reference work on
this specialist subject and it is certainly more readable than the likes of
Weinberg and Blank on Take-Overs and Mergers. However, Solley is not yet
ready to abandon the bar. 'Getting people off complicated fraud charges was
considerably easier than getting this book produced', complains the author.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Lonrho's Tiny Rowland deserves to be congratulated for selling George Outram
to the existing management. The ownership of Scotland's top newspaper, the
Glasgow Herald, is back where it belongs - in Scotland.
The price - around 20 times earnings - sounds a lot, but Lonrho is selling a
quality asset at the bottom of a recession, and a couple of years from now,
Outram's profits could easily have doubled.
Lonrho could probably have got more for Outram if it had auctioned it more
aggressively. But then the Scots wouldn't own it.
Now that Scotland has regained ownership of one of its national assets, it
will be interesting to see whether the real control passes into the hands of
Edinburgh's financial mafia, or whether Outram's new owners will demonstrate
a more independent streak.
If The Independent can pick German-born Sir Ralf Dahrendorf as its chairman,
surely the new team at George Outram doesn't have to insist on having a
Scotsman as chairman.

<TEXT>
If the Governors of the big central banks can use their regular monthly
meetings at the Bank for International Settlements in Basle to get to know
each other socially, why can't the other ranks do the same?
It seems that some of them are planning to do just that, but in less formal
surroundings. Observer hears that the top economists of the Bank of England,
the Banque de France and the Bundesbank have decided to break with tradition
and inaugurate regular get-togethers. Mervyn King, Andre Icard and Otmar
Issing are kicking off with a cosy dinner in Paris tonight.
Of course, there is a fairly heavy menu. The trio will be debating the
outlook for German interest rates after last week's German public sector pay
deal. Additionally, they will be discussing prospects for harmonising the
central banks' monetary policy instruments ahead of moves towards monetary
union.
If they have any time over fruit and cheese, they might get around to
discussing the chimeric question of where the European central bank should
be sited. Naturally, the Bundesbank's Issing is keen on Frankfurt, while the
Bank of England's King has a sneaking suspicion that Bonn might be the
compromise candidate to back.

Sir, I was surprised to read that Chiddingfold no longer has any bank

with the same size population as Chiddingfold and situated six miles from
its county town, has two thriving sub-branches of the Credit Mutuel and
Credit Agricole.
The Credit Agricole agence is open all morning Tuesday to Saturday (closed
Sunday and Monday). It is staffed by two men equipped with two computer
terminals who have been there for years and know all their customers not
only by name but often by account number and personal circumstances. And
there are even chairs for queueing customers.
Are these reasons why Credit Agricole is the largest bank in France and one

FT  11 MAY 92 / Leading Article: Earth Summit gets earthy
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE IMMINENCE of the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro, now only three weeks
away, is beginning to focus political minds, though as in all gatherings of
this kind, the preparatory process is degenerating into last-minute
horse-trading rather than promoting well-considered harmony. The question is
whether the resulting compromises will damage Rio's prospects, or save it
from the shambles which many people fear it could become.
Recent days have brought some progress on two important fronts. The
conclusion over the weekend of a draft treaty on measures to protect the
world climate should pave the way for action on greenhouse gases, one of the
most serious environmental threats now facing the world. Similarly, the
agreement by members of the World Bank to beef up the Global Environmental
Facility (GEF) - a special fund to help developing countries protect the
environment - provides the basis for the financial commitments which should
be one of the key results of Rio.
There is an unmistakable air of political compromise over the climate
treaty. The original intention to bind the signatories to reducing their
greenhouse gas emissions to 1990 levels by the year 2000 has been watered
down to a statement that such an aim would represent 'an appropriate
signal'. This is a disappointing retreat for a document that will be central
to the Rio agenda. It also marks the failure of the industrial countries to
persuade the US to drop its opposition to specific emission reduction
deadlines, and thereby their inability to put up a united front at the
summit. This will tarnish the example they hoped to set there to win the
support of the rest of the world for action to clean up the environment.
However, the alternative - risking a boycott by President Bush - would have
been even more damaging.
Full representation
It is essential to the success of the already fragile Rio agenda that the
world's largest polluter, and its largest provider of financial resources,
should be fully represented there.
There will be widespread disappointment, particularly in the Third World,
over the decision to revamp the GEF as a Rio vehicle because of its link
with the rich country-dominated World Bank. But other options, notably the
new Green Fund proposed by many developing countries, would merely add to
the proliferation of international agencies and waste the experience
acquired by the GEF. The accusation of exclusivity frequently levelled at
the GEF is to be countered by throwing it open to universal membership.
Unrealistic expectations
Yet to be resolved is the question of how much money should be committed to
the GEF at Rio. Unfortunately, the Rio secretariat has raised expectations
to unrealistic levels by referring to the Dollars 100bn and more that will
be needed each year to fund a Third World clean-up. Actual commitments are
likely to be only a tiny fraction of that sum. Moreover, it is important
that the various agreements that do come out of Rio ensure that green aid is
properly targeted and not swallowed up by an ineffective aid machine.
The task of the Rio organisers in the few weeks that remain is to ensure
that the world develops realistic expectations for the event. Although there
is undoubtedly mounting global concern for the environment, the preparatory
process has exposed deep divisions about the nature of the threat and the
remedies required - between rich and poor countries, green lobbies and
industry, and even among the industrial countries. It would be wrong to
expect Rio to produce hard and fast solutions; positions among participants
are too far apart for that. It may not even produce large sums of money. But
it is beginning to acquire some momentum. Its success may have to be
measured principally in terms of the political commitments which are made
there and the strength of the machinery which it creates to hold
participants to their pledges.
Only a week ago, there was a danger that Rio would convene with nothing on
the table. That will not now be the case; the next fortnight may even
produce a second treaty. The task ahead is huge, and at least this is a
start.

FT  11 MAY 92 / Competing claims of man and nature: The US is striving to
find a sensible balance between economic progress and environmentalism
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When Larry Mason tore up his suburban roots back east and set out for the
vast green forests of America's Pacific shore, he was following an
imperative as old as US history: go west, tame the land, and make your
fortune.
And Mr Mason did just that, in a modest way: he set up in business as a
sawmill owner in the remote little logging community of Forks, a scruffy
scattering of bungalows and mobile homes amid the wooded mountain slopes of
Washington state's Olympic Peninsula.
Over 20 years, Mr Mason, whose luxuriant moustache, coarse-cut beard and
beady eyes give him a passing resemblance to a 19th-century pioneer, built
up a company with annual sales of Dollars 3m, employing 40 people.
But today the sawmill is shuttered and Mr Mason's life is in ruins,
casualties of a new and very different American national imperative: to save
the continent's remaining flora and fauna, which are increasingly endangered
by economic development.
Mr Mason's particular nemesis is Strix occidentalis caurina, alias the
Northern Spotted Owl, a shy, retiring bird that inhabits what remains of the
ancient forests which used to blanket the coastal north-west.
The Northern Spotted Owl was declared a threatened species by the US Fish
and Wildlife Service in July 1990 and this, coupled with a tangle of legal
cases over its protection, has brought logging to a halt in the vast tracts
of western forest owned by the federal government.
The result: a sharp reduction in western timber production; national lumber
prices at record levels; ruin for the Larry Masons in dozens of rural
communities from California up to Washington; and a triumphant environmental
movement.
The human cost of protecting man's feathered friend is all too visible in
Forks, which lies a three-and-a-half hour drive east of Seattle beyond the
serenely beautiful Olympic National Park. Unemployment, marital strife and
children's behavioural problems have risen sharply in past few years, while
house prices have plummeted to 1978 levels. 'The environmentalists,' says
Mrs Patty Vaughan, a local teacher, 'have destroyed many people's lives.'
There is also a psychological price. Lumberjacks used to be regarded as the
archetypal American macho male heroes. Suddenly, says Mr Mason, who now runs
a local timber lobbying group, 'they're being told by the press they're
forest rapers, one step above child molesters'.
Industrial decline is always painful, but what makes the Pacific timber
workers particularly angry is the fact that they are casualties not of
broad, comprehensible economic forces beyond anyone's control, but of strict
US environmental legislation, which implicitly favours plants, animals and
fish ahead of human endeavour.
The protection of the Spotted Owl is by far the most sweeping application
yet of this legislation, and the case has sparked off a national furore over
how to strike a sensible balance between economic progress and
environmentalism.
This will reach a new pitch next week when Mr Manuel Lujan, the US interior
secretary, publishes two rival proposals for owl conservation, one of them
preserving timber jobs at the expense of owl habitat.
With so many developed countries grappling with similar issues, the debate
has universal lessons. So too does the fact that the owl controversy is
fuelling a nascent backlash among US consumers and corporations against what
critics of the environmental movement say is its uncompromising idealism.
Or, as an embittered Larry Mason puts it: 'Those guys are out of their
minds. They think the government can shoot the cow and still get the milk.'
The battle has its origins in 1973 when Congress, in a fit of environmental
penitence, passed the Endangered Species Act. This obliges the federal
government to monitor the nation's wildlife and maintain lists of species
deemed to be 'threatened' or, more seriously, 'endangered' with extinction.
More than 600 species and sub-species have been listed since then by
government agencies, including such exotica as the Puritan Tiger Beetle and
the Oregon Silverspot butterfly and the (now extinct) Dusky Seaside Sparrow.
In each case, the government is obliged to designate 'critical habitats'
vital for the creature's conservation and produce plans to help its numbers
recover. Many environmentalists believe the legislation is a model for the
rest of the world.
However, the law excludes any consideration of economic factors (other than
a little-used appeal mechanism which permits a team of federal government
ministers - known as the 'god committee' because of its power of life and
death - to exempt specific projects). This fact was brought home forcefully
in the late 1970s, in the celebrated case of the Tennessee snail darter, a
three-inch fish with a fondness for devouring snails, which was found at the
site of a Dollars 100m dam construction and listed as endangered.
Work on the dam ground to a halt. The owners fought the case up to the
Supreme Court, which declared that Congress's aim in passing the act had
been to prevent the extinction of a species, irrespective of the cost.
The dam was eventually built, thanks to special legislation exempting it
from the act, but the legal groundwork was laid for a larger clash over the
Spotted Owl.
Environmentalists adopted the bird in the 1980s as a surrogate for a much
larger concern - the rapid depletion of the 'old growth' forests of the
north-west under the loggers' saws. 'Old growth' means areas that have never
been harvested, containing trees hundreds of years old, making up a forest
with a many-layered canopy. They are distinct from 'secondary growth' -
reforested areas of much younger, more uniform trees.
The environmentalists argue that huge swathes of old-growth forests must be
preserved, both for aesthetic reasons and because they comprise a unique
ecosystem, supporting a huge variety of wildlife that does not survive well
in areas of secondary growth. The Spotted Owl, labelled an 'indicator'
species for the health of old forests, is said to need a variegated canopy
to hunt effectively.
The environmentalists also argue, with justification, that the forest
industry's method of 'clear-cutting' - removing all the vegetation in a
logging area - creates soil erosion and chokes fishing streams.
Since virtually all the old growth on private land has already been logged,
the battle has centred on the vast tracts of woodland owned by the federal
government and managed principally by the US Forest Service.
This agency, which is required to manage its lands for 'multiple use', has
come under increasing criticism from conservationists for being
hand-in-glove with the timber industry, by both selling lumber at less than
market prices and allowing too many trees to be felled.
With the listing of the owl, logging has halted on Forest Service lands
while rival plans are put forward for the bird's preservation. Some of these
would ban timber harvesting across 6m acres - roughly equivalent to 10 per
cent of the British Isles.
The timber industry argues that this is far too much, and points out that
about 3m acres of old growth are already permanently set aside in areas such
as national parks, which are out-of-bounds to logging. It asks: just how
large a 'nature museum' does the US need? The environmentalists reply: a
very large one, to preserve the delicate ecosystem.
Yet much remains unclear about the fundamentals of the ecosystem. There is
controversy, for example, as to whether the Northern Spotted Owl is a
distinct sub-species from its common cousin, The Californian Spotted Owl.
Even the theory that the Spotted Owl is an indicator species for old-growth
forests is disputed by the timber industry, which points out that many of
the birds nest happily in the secondary-growth trees which they are supposed
to hate.
Many of those nesting trees are on private forest land, and that causes big
headaches for the owners because the Endangered Species Act requires them to
create a large 'no-logging' zone around every owl residence.
As a thick, dour report from the Forest Service puts it: 'The set of factors
affecting long-term viability of the Northern Spotted Owl are complex and
not precisely known.'
The competing claims of the two sides raise issues not only of fact but also
of national policy. Yet critics point out that the Endangered Species Act,
with its worthy insistence on restoring every species, irrespective of the
cost, refuses to acknowledge that tough trade-offs have to be made between
economic development and conservation.
Nor does it provide any compensation for property owners who suddenly find
themselves out of pocket because of conservation moves - a situation that
underlies much of the growing anti-environment backlash. Says Mr Lynn
Michaelis, chief economist of Weyerhaeuser, one of America's biggest forest
products companies: 'If society wants to save the Spotted Owl, that's fine,
but it mustn't impose an implicit tax on private landowners by taking away
their right to manage the land and not compensating them.' Compensation, he
adds, would have the further advantage of making environmental trade-offs
more explicit.
Next week, the interior secretary will produce a recovery plan for the
Spotted Owl, as he is required to do by the Endangered Species Act. It is
likely to entail the loss of at least 30,000 jobs in the north-west.
Troubled by this, Mr Lujan will also offer Congress the option of passing
legislation which would exclude the owl from the Endangered Species Act and
merely preserve its numbers. This would sharply cut job losses to about
15,000. This plan is reported to include reducing the owl's protected range
which might allow a resumption of logging on the Olympic Peninsula and to
the north-east of Seattle.
Coincidentally, the Endangered Species Act is itself up for re-authorisation
by Congress in October. But in an election year in a country where urban
conservationists vastly outnumber those making their living from the land,
the politicians can be expected to proceed on both issues about as fast as
Utah's endangered Kanab Ambersnail.
Even if it did move quickly, it would be years too late for the Larry Masons
of the west.

FT  11 MAY 92 / Marketplace law and justice for all: On Tuesday, the FT
starts weekly coverage of the European Court of Justice
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg ruled in 1990 that a
British Act of Parliament could be suspended until the question of its
compatibility with European Community law had been tested, it brought home
to the British people the supremacy of EC law over English law.
That case - which involved a challenge by Spanish fishermen to the UK
government's attempts to prevent them fishing in British waters - made clear
to everybody what Lord Denning, the former Master of the Rolls, recognised
in 1974, that 'the Treaty (of Rome) is like an incoming tide. It flows into
the estuaries and up the rivers. It cannot be held back.'
That EC law takes precedence over national law has long been apparent, but
what has been less appreciated is the crucial role that the European Court
of Justice (ECJ) has played in shaping the rules and regulations which
govern the Community and the wider European marketplace.
The task of interpreting this growing body of law falls to the ECJ and its
sister court, the Court of First Instance. Brussels looks to the ECJ to
ensure the even-handed implementation by EC states of internal market
legislation. Member states, individuals and companies look to it to check
the growing power of Brussels, to review the legality of acts and decisions
of the European Commission and the Council of Ministers, and to goad them
into action where they have neglected their obligations under the Rome
Treaty.
The Court's role is central to the Community's well-being. And yet it
remains the quiet man of the Community's institutions. Europeans still
confuse it regularly with the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg
and the International Court of Justice in The Hague.
In the 1960s and early 1970s it was widely seen as the only Community
institution which functioned efficiently. In a creative period spanning 15
years, during which the fundamental principles of the direct effect of
Community law and its primacy over the national laws of the member states
were established, the Court was willing to, and did fill, the vacuum created
by the inaction of the Commission and the Council.
Since the end of the 1970s the activist, primarily because it recognises
that the other Community institutions are now operating more effectively.
But its role in shaping and interpreting EC law has not diminished.
Lord Slynn, Britain's judge in Luxembourg until March this year, wrote
recently of the important developments made by the ECJ over the past decade.
On the procedural level, he said it had: developed its jurisprudence to
cover the European Parliament; ruled that national courts have an obligation
to give effective remedies to complainants under Community law no less
favourable than those available under national law; recognised in the
landmark Francovich case last year that there is a right to compensation for
EC citizens injured by a member state's failure to give effect to Community
law obligations; and ruled that administrative agencies as well as courts
must give precedence to Community law.
There had also been fundamental developments in substantive law, Lord Slynn
said. The ECJ had made great strides towards the elimination of sex
discrimination in the employment and pension fields. In the 1990 Barber case
the Court ruled that men and women should receive equal pensions as well as
equal pay for equal work, and that individuals have an enforceable right to
non-discriminatory benefits even though national legislation may exempt
pension schemes from the equal pay laws. The Court had also rooted out
discrimination on the grounds of nationality so far as students and workers
are concerned; and developed rules relating to competition.
The ECJ's impact on the day-to-day operations of companies doing business in
Europe has been no less important. The opportunities offered to business by
European integration are immense. But to take full advantage of a wider
European market characterised by the European Economic Area, and closer
trading links with the countries of eastern Europe, companies need to
understand the rules and regulations of the marketplace.
This week, to reflect the vital role the Court will play in creating a
framework for business in the single European market, the FT is launching a
weekly column covering developments in Luxembourg.
This year alone, in just three areas - competition, state aid to industry
and anti-dumping laws - the ECJ and the Court of First Instance (CFI) have
handed down a number of important decisions affecting business.
In cases involving 14 PVC manufacturers, the CFI found that the procedure
followed by the Commission in deciding to fine the companies for operating
an alleged cartel bore so little resemblance to the requirements of its own
procedural rules that it should be treated as never having been made. The
Court's criticisms were so far-reaching that they could result in many other
decisions taken by the Commission over the past 35 years also being treated
as invalid. The judgment opened up the possibility of several
appeals,particularly by companies fined in the past for breach of EC
competition rules.
In the state aid field, the short-cut procedure adopted by the Commission in
investigating the allegation of an illegal state payment by the British
government to British Aeropsace when it bought the Rover car group gave the
ECJ the chance to set out the proper procedures to be followed by the
Commission in such matters. The Court ruled that the failure of the
Commission to take evidence from Rover and BAe had deprived both of their
right to be heard. It set aside the Commission's decision to order BAe to
repay Pounds 33m to the UK government.
The new column, to be written by the barristers of Brick Court Chambers,
Brussels, will appear every Tuesday when the European Court is sitting. The
FT is making this commitment to coverage of the ECJ because it recognises
the increasing importance of EC law. As Ferdinand Mount says in his book,
The British Constitution Now, the Spanish fishermen's case reinforced 'the
dawning awareness that the European courts, gradually, informally, but
ineluctably, are themselves coming to make up a loose-knit sort of supreme
court for us.'

FT  11 MAY 92 / Arts: The Hypochondriacs - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ST GEORGE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Plato's Cratylus knew that far from being able to step into the same river
twice, one could not step into the same river once. He eventually settled on
moving his finger in response to everything. A measure of Cratylus's view is
essential for enjoying Botho Strauss's The Hypochondriacs at the Citizens
Theatre, Glasgow. Without it, the evening becomes frustrating and pointless:
intellectually vibrant but theatrically dull.
Strauss's expressionist play relies on the notion that anything can mean
anything: time becomes elastic, and lives have purpose only in relation to
others. Strauss wrote the play when he was 26; it belies its 1972 premiere,
seeming much more from the 1930s. The play marries magic realism to a form
of implacable logic, a meeting of Gunter Grass and Wittgenstein.
As explanation for its method, the play offers this: 'an apparently free and
planlessly spent life is only a prelude to the moment when you realise it.'
The plot flickers in and out of prominence, undermined by characters unsure
of themselves: 'What exactly are we talking about?' - 'I don't know, I was
just reacting.' However, a sequence of events emerges, and the action occurs
in turn-of-the-century Germany, just before psychoanalysis would have made
it all explicable.
Vladimir, an incurable hypochondriac, lives with his lover Nelly. She has
been bailed on a murder charge by two dodgy pharmaceutical entrepreneurs
after a cure for tuberculosis. Around them, Vladimir's mother, father and
maid weave a sinister intrigue worthy of Len Deighton in Ipcress File form.
Vladimir's diseased and decadent intelligence is met by Nelly's cool
hysteria and the extraordinary venom of his Mother. Each has a litany of
non-verbal gestures, mimes, grunts and statements which are variously
interpreted by those around them. One does not need to be a student of
Saussure to realise that collective communication is under threat where
meaning itself is random. People agree not in what they say, but in the form
of their life.
The play's consistencies come from an awkward faith in personality. Anything
a character does is consistent, so the unexpected simply disappears. This
drains the evening of dramatic tension; for where anything can happen,
nothing can surprise.
The pleasures of Strauss's play are more arcane: he invites a theatrical
daydreaming; he urges thinking about thinking, so one finds that this really
does provoke thought. The set answers the disjunctions of the text; sofas on
lime chippings surround a fish tank. 'All the things around us,' one
character confides, 'we observe at the same time as we bring them about'; so
the actors move the furniture obsessively, repositioning the stage
impedimenta.
The acting is detached and precise, with fine performances from Julie
Saunders as Nelly and Gerrard McArthur as Vladimir and his father. David
Fielding's direction slows the play to a crawl, but then he has been faced
with the task of staging an attitude of mind.
Citizens Theatre, Glasgow, until May 23 (041 429 0022)

FT  11 MAY 92 / Arts: Joint efforts save the day - Sponsorship
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
No one can accuse the Association for Business Sponsorship of the Arts
(ABSA) of not giving a lead as arts organisations struggle to find sponsors
in a cold climate. ABSA, which was formed to promote the benefits of
sponsorship, has quickly found a new backer for its most prestigious event,
the annual awards ceremony for imaginative arts sponsorships.
For well over a decade The Daily Telegraph provided the Pounds 28,000 plus
funding. It has called it a day, but Arthur Andersen has stepped into the
breach. ABSA's other big social occasion, the Goodman-Garrett dinner, where
individuals receive prizes, is to be sponsored, for the first time, by Reed

Despite the efforts of ABSA many major corporate sponsors are cutting back
on their commitments this year. This is because they give a fixed percentage
of their profits to good causes and their profits have been reduced. But
ABSA's Colin Tweedy is adamant that total sponsorship will rise in 1992,
thanks to the involvement of new sponsors among small and medium sized
companies.
Support for his theory comes from Blackheath Concert Halls in south east
London, which sees no falling away in its corporate funding. But changing
times demand changing approaches and it hit on a happy solution to the
sponsorship of its ambitious four day Schubertiade last week. It was
underwritten by three professional firms: Drivers Jonas, the chartered
surveyors; Grant Thornton, the accountants; and Turner Kenneth Brown, the
solicitors.
This not only reduced the cost - to Pounds 7,500 from each firm - but could
actually benefit clients (as well as sponsors). In the social gatherings
around the song cycles a corporate guest of, say, Drivers Jonas, who is in
the market for a new solicitor or a new accountant, could be introduced to
plenty of them. And so it went on. Joint sponsorship often fails because the
companies sharing the bill have nothing in common. Here there was mutual
self-interest, and the chance to meet potential new clients, as well as keep
happy existing ones.
                       *      *      *
Joint sponsorship deals are also attracting large companies. The cost of
backing a new opera production at Covent Garden can be Pounds 150,000. Not
surprisingly there are few takers. Even when the opera houses accept a much
lower sum for a sponsorship deal - BMW is reputed to have secured ENO's
revival of Street Scene for around Pounds 30,000 - it can still seem an
unacceptably large investment.
Shell, with an arts sponsorship budget of around Pounds 450,000, is
investigating alternatives. It is talking with Opera North about a touring
production next year in which Shell will act as the main sponsor, putting up
perhaps Pounds 50,000, while smaller companies take on the local sponsorship
for Pounds 10,000 or so when Opera North performs in their cities.
Such a deal could draw in new sponsors who would be guided by Shell into
what is possible from the connection. Any interested companies on the Opera
North touring circuit should contact Shell.

More groups of sponsors could be spotted at the Birmingham Symphony Hall
last month for the first UK visit by the orchestra of La Scala, Milan. For
once they were non-paying guests. The evening had a sponsor - British Gas -
but the other clutches of businessmen were the major backers of 'Sounds Like
Birmingham', the biggest music festival ever held in the UK. It was one of
three gala evenings that they received as a sweetener for putting up over
Pounds 20,000 each for the year long binge.
'Sounds Like Birmingham' quickly hit its sponsorship target of Pounds
150,000, suggesting that it is only the run-of-the-mill arts events that are
finding it hard to find sponsors. The specials secure backing. Most of the
names were locally familiar - Cadbury, BT, Ansells, Cooper Lybrand, the
Grand Hotel - but included Arcadian, builders of a new shopping mall in the
city.
A disappointment was the failure to attract smaller local businessmen,
especially Asian, to the project, but the big companies showed imagination.
Cadbury is supporting ten groups of musicians, ranging from jazz through
bhangra to early music - which perform each week in venues like
supermarkets; BT is backing a world music festival; while Birmingham
International Airport has commissioned a 'sound sculpture' for its departure
hall.
                       *      *      *
More sponsored sculpture - this time in Paris, in the Bagatelle, a
dream-like English garden tucked away in the Bois de Boulogne. On June 11
the Queen will open a major Henry Moore exhibition of 27 large bronzes.
Given the cost and complexity of transporting such works, some weighing up
to seven tons, this could be the last time such a major exhibition travels
overseas.
Half the Pounds 300,000 plus bill is being picked up by the Henry Moore
Foundation and the British Council, but Pounds 170,000 comes from a nicely
Anglo-French bunch of sponsors, led by the Compagnie Generale des Eaux, but
including Shell France, British Steel and British Airways. One intriguing
backer, with Pounds 40,000, is GEC Alsthom. GEC is notoriously stingy on
sponsorship in the UK but has been convinced by its French subsidiary, which
it half owns, that this commitment to European co-operation will go down
well in France.
                       *      *      *
Despite half hearted efforts by the Government through minimal tax benefits,
and a strong personal lead given by Lord Palumbo, chairman of the Arts
Council, private patronage of the arts in the UK remains at an abysmally low
level. But the Hattori family of Japan has come up with Pounds 300,000 to
underwrite the Folkestone Menuhin International Violin Competition. The
money will be spread over the next three biennial competitions, starting in
March 1993.
A stipulation in the funding is that the competition should remain based in
Folkestone. The Hattori's have a vested interest in the Folkestone
competition maintaining its reputation. A 1989 winner was Joji Hattori.

FT  11 MAY 92 / Arts: Music in 12 Parts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Halfway through Thursday evening in the Festival Hall, I decided that 6
would be enough. Philip Glass and his loyal team were playing the complete
dozen, his Late Minimalist magnum opus of 1971-74: from 7 o'clock to 11.30
as originally announced, but emended on the spot to 11.45 and by my
reckoning, unlikely to finish much before midnight. Though the large
audience looked like real devotees, I suspect that they began to slip away
soon after I did.
For younger readers, I should explain what Minimalism was. In postwar
Europe, in the wake of Schoenberg and Webern, a whole generation of
composers became convinced that if their music did not strike 'conventional'
audiences as a-thematic and a-rhythmic, they must be trading indecently upon
outworn expressive routines. As they bore that thought in mind, their
audiences dwindled to a knowledgeable few. Later, the American Minimalists
(Terry Riley first of all, then Steve Reich and Glass etc) hit upon a
different and less rebarbative way of shucking off the past.
It struck them that sour European dissonances were unnecessary. Instead you
could recycle the simplest and most reassuringly familiar routines as long
as you flattened them into plain, inexpressive elements. Your new claim on
listeners' attention would lie in the new patterns you made with them: slow,
almost subliminal shifts of tonal focus and rhythmic basis, as you let your
component lines go out of step, and also the audible moire effects - quite
new in music, and rich in potential - as the different levels separated off.
For Terry Riley, that was only one line of untrammelled experiment among
many; for Reich it is one that has drawn him into clever, close-focus
explorations. Glass is harder to classify. His earlier music exploited the
new possibilities hard, with a lot of fluent linear invention that gleamed
brightly. (when rigorously played, and well transmitted). Music in 12 Parts
had a broader aim: to sustain a marathon live-performance span, as it was
suddenly fashionable to do in the early 1970s - commonly lubricated by a lot
of dope.
At the first interval it was deeply nostalgic to detect a sharp whiff of
that in the Festival Hall foyer. In a relaxed, meditative frame of mind one
can let one's thoughts wander as Glass's music winds on, and still register
the big, glacial shifts when they make themselves felt. In plain practical
terms, however, the South Bank performance failed the composer. Whether his
linear knack or (less confidently) his harmonic lurches were meant to keep
things going, the sound-reproduction in the hall sold him short.
Instead, what we heard over certain of the amplified channels had a flat,
ugly glare without depth, and around most of the soprano notes (from the
super-reliable Lisa Carol Bielawa) there was a percussive surrounding
crackle: not hi-tech at all, and eventually numbing to the ear - which was
why I gave up early. If the price of hearing an expansive Glass concert is
deafness for the next few concerts, it is too high.

The makers of Channel 4's six-part series Female Parts (9.00) are clearly
hoping to hook a huge audience by starting with the most provocative of the
series: 'Rude Women'. This, we are assured, is 'a full frontal assault on
the myth that women don't like sex, don't talk about it and never make the
first move', which sounds like a trio of straw, er, women which should not
take too much knocking down. The Pussy Posse hold a safe sex party, the
editor of one of the new spate of women's sex magazines explains just what
you cannot show, and Susanna, who has a drawer full of chains, explains how
she has never found any man tough enough to tie her up.
Horizon looks into the question of who really discovered the virus that
causes Aids. In 1984 American Robert Gallo claimed the credit, but today
most of those involved accept that the discovery rightfully belongs to Dr
Luc Montagnier of the Pasteur Institute in Paris (8.10 BBC2).
In Panorama the FT's John Plender tries to establish whether, in future,
owning a house in Britain will still be a sure way of doubling your money
(9.30 BBC1).

The largest European employers are a virtuous lot - or at least they claim
to be. More than 90 per cent have equal opportunities policies, almost that
number sponsor cultural or sporting events, and more than 60 per cent say
they have carried out environmental audits.
These are the latest findings of a survey* from the Henley Centre for
Forecasting which has questioned the top 500 employers across sectors in the
European Community about their employment practices.
A surprising 32 per cent of organisations - half in the public sector -
claim to have a woman on the board or in a similar top function. Job sharing
is offered by 48 per cent, career breaks by 59 per cent and maternity leave
beyond legal requirements by 40 per cent.
However, the Henley researchers say the survey shows that women's careers
remain hampered by lack of childcare: on-site childcare is provided by 9 per
cent of companies and an additional 16 per cent have off-site provision.
Dissatisfaction with employers' childcare facilities is high, particularly
in countries with a relatively weak family structure, such as the UK, France
and Germany.
On training and education, 87 per cent of employers say they have formal
management development programmes and 85 per cent subsidise employees'
studies. Meanwhile, 66 per cent offer retraining programmes and 42 per cent
offer extended study leave.
Henley notes the increasing effort that organisations are having to make to
impress consumers with their green credentials and social awareness. The
proportion of EC manufacturing companies which have carried out
environmental checks on their activities, or intended to carry out such
audits, is nearly 70 per cent.
Overall, Henley considers the survey results give a positive impression of
employment practices and conditions in Europe's largest companies. However,
without increases in childcare provision, there is likely to be little
growth in the numbers of women achieving executive and managerial grades,
the report concludes.

FT  11 MAY 92 / Management: Losing patience with private medicine - The
soaring cost of healthcare insurance is forcing many employers to limit the
benefits that are available to their employees
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The costs of private healthcare are catching up with British companies. Over
the past 20 years, private medical insurance has become an increasingly
common - and expected - perk among white collar employees.
But companies are now facing potentially crippling increases in costs as
premiums struggle to keep pace with rocketing claims payments.
Over the past year, premiums have gone up by an average 20 per cent, with
some clients paying up to 40 per cent more.
'The word has got around personnel directors - be very careful what medical
benefits you offer,' says Eddie O'Hara who works with the health insurance
division of Willis Corroon, the insurance broker, and looks after 300
corporate clients.
Many companies are looking at ways of cutting down on claims in return for
lower premiums. Administration is being tightened and employees are being
asked to share some of the cost of treatment.
Some companies are striking deals with hospitals offering treatment at a
specially negotiated rate. Above all, employees who benefit from corporate
healthcare schemes are being encouraged to think of their private healthcare
as supplementing, rather than replacing, the National Health Service.
About 12 per cent of British people have private medical health insurance,
the majority of them through corporate schemes. Initially made available as
an incentive to senior executives during the 1970s, private health provision
cascaded down to the lowliest white collar grades during the 1980s and in
some industries, like pharmaceuticals, is common among blue collar workers.
'It has become almost as common a benefit as paid holidays,' says Mike
Tiler, who heads a health insurance team at Mercer Fraser, the actuary and
employee benefits company.
In corporate schemes, employers pay either the whole or part of the premium
or sometimes simply negotiate a discount - generally about 10 per cent - on
the price available to individuals. Premium income amounted to more than
Pounds 1.09bn in 1990 after a decade which saw the number of employees
benefiting from health schemes increasing by an average of 5 per cent each
year.
But the growth in medical costs has moved up at four times that rate and
shows signs of escalating. More expensive, high-tech treatments are more
common and wage costs have risen.
With interest in health issues rising, employees are much more likely to
claim on policies than they were 20 years ago. Tiler says that the
increasing range of treatments available has also led to some abuse of the
system.
'One pensioner used to spend 10 weeks a year in a psychiatric hospital. She
thought it was a holiday.'
The government's health service reforms have aggravated problems by
encouraging general practitioners to refer patients to private healthcare
wherever possible, leaving the doctors with more resources free for the
treatment of NHS patients.
Until recently, healthcare premiums were kept down by the entry of new
insurers into the market - such as Norwich Union and Orion, a subsidiary of
Nationale Nederlanden - which put competitive pressure on the established
companies - Bupa, PPA and WPA.
This is now beginning to change, following the losses being experienced by
market stalwarts and newcomers alike in 1991.
Medical insurance premiums have now grown to 3 per cent of many companies'
wage bills. The figure is even higher for some companies which have
particularly long-established schemes.
The situation is not yet as bad as in the US, where medical premiums make up
18 per cent of the total wage bill of some companies. Indeed, according to
one recent survey, US companies rate healthcare costs as one of their
biggest concerns
But even at present levels, some UK managers are looking hard at their
programmes.
Modifications now being introduced include:
The introduction of an excess - under which employees pay the first Pounds
50 or Pounds 100 of any treatment. Philip Anderson, marketing director of
Bupa, the country's biggest private health insurer calls it the 'cold shower
effect'.
Better scheme administration and the introduction of central controls.
According to O'Hara, companies sometimes need to find out exactly which
employees have access to which benefit. 'In some cases with companies which
have several locations around the country, employers simply don't know what
the claims record is.'
Vetting of claims by senior managers.
Closer monitoring of the cost of surgery or hospital stays. Mercer Fraser
and other advisers carry out 'medical audits' - adjusting and costing claims
so that they relate the real work done.
Preferred hospital arrangements, by which scheme managers negotiate reduced
prices for the bulk purchase of administration and accommodation with
private or NHS hospitals, are becoming increasingly common, says Anderson.
Persuading employees to use NHS facilities wherever possible with schemes
making payments to beneficiaries for each night they spend in an NHS
hospital, for example.
Willis provides a counselling service to advise scheme members whether to
opt for private or public treatment. 'If for example they want their wisdom
teeth out but are not in any pain, we suggest they wait to have it done on
the NHS, even if they have to wait for the treatment for a couple of
months.'
The scope to tackle one of the biggest problems - the liabilities of company
health schemes to retired employees - is limited.
Almost all schemes now exclude cover for employees once they have retired
but some employers - among them some UK clearing banks - have accumulated
future liabilities.
Premiums paid into schemes by the beneficiaries have almost all been spent
in paying actual claims. There is little left over to fund future care, the
cost of which is growing exponentially.
Employers have bought out some executives by paying them benefits now in
exchange for their giving up future entitlement to private healthcare cover
in the future.
But Tiler warns that in some cases, the liabilities 'could wreck a company'.
'Its a massive issue which people are only just beginning to tackle. It will
call for some creative thinking,' adds O'Hara.

FT  11 MAY 92 / Management: A little extra self-help at the Halifax
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
John Teasdale, who manages a corporate health programme for Halifax Building
Society, says his company introduced a number of changes following a 30 per
cent increase in premiums last year.
Halifax, which employs more than 24,000 people, is typical of the white
collar employers who have begun to offer healthcare in the last 20 years.
The company's scheme which offers Bupa care to employees and a discounted
rate to spouses and dependents began in 1980. Last year's increase 'forced
us to look closely at what we were doing,' says Teasdale.
Halifax introduced 'excesses', making their staff liable for the first
Pounds 50 of any claim. The company also took action to change the attitudes
of its staff towards the scheme.
'We found that people regarded the scheme as an alternative to the National
Health Service.
But the society sees the scheme as complementary. We had to make sure that
they understood a claim on the scheme was a claim on the society, says
Teasdale.'
Halifax is having claims forms reprinted to show the its logo to press home
the point.
The measures had an immediate impact. and Bupa increased its premiums by
only 5 per cent at the 1992 renewal. 'That speaks for itself,' says
Teasdale, who adds that charging has limited use of the service by employees
suffering, for example, sports injuries.
Halifax has also taken more measures to save costs. It encourages
Halifax-based employees to use the local Bupa-Elland hospital, with which it
has negotiated discounts, rather than others in the locality.

FT  11 MAY 92 / People: Hosking joins CSFB team
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
For a firm with a reputation for macho style, Credit Suisse First Boston has
adopted a laudably incremental approach to assembling a European equity
research team.
Perhaps the final piece in the jigsaw is Lisa Hosking, who joins from SG
Warburg. She will work with the London team of 16 sector analysts collected
over the past three years from such sources as Salomon Brothers, Banque
National de Paris and Drexels.
Hosking comes with excellent credentials; she was rated the best
international strategist by investors in both the 1991 Extel poll and a
recent survey carried out by Institutional Investor magazine.
To these achievements she can now add another first: the first researcher to
join CSFB as a managing director. Head of equity research Dan Meade says
that he has been trying to hire Hosking for more than two years. This may
have been the offer she could not refuse.
But after six years in Warburg's civilised environment, can she fit in with
the hard-driving, hard-selling CSFB credo?
An American with a degree in economics from the University of California at
Berkeley, she is one of the new breed of mathematical, quantitative
strategists. But the lady is no mere technician.
In the words of one colleague: 'She has more than enough personality to work
with people who are by nature very tough to work with.'

*****
Nicolas Bowater, a victim of the exigencies of a short-term strategy at his
previous employer, has joined the steady Swiss at Credit Suisse Asset
Management in the newly created position of marketing director for the
private clients division.
Two years ago Bowater, now 49, was with the private client side of Mercury
Asset Management. With his boss eight years his junior, he was 'a classic
headhunter material'. He succumbed to the sirens from the Bank of Bermuda,
and the opportunity 'to put my own stamp and authority on the business'. He
spent 15 months selling the bank's services from London to non-domiciled
clients before it decided it would concentrate its international marketing
efforts elsewhere.
'The party moved the goal posts, but I suppose that's life,' says Bowater,
who has decided he prefers the long-term approach of the Swiss 'where
tomorrow is the year 2000'. Part of his job at CSAM, which manages about
Pounds 1bn of private client monies, will be simply to increase the
company's name recognition, 'particularly among professional
intermediaries'. Buckmaster &amp; Moore (acquired by Credit Suisse) was 'very
well known on the private client side' but CSAM has lost some of that
awareness.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Derek Pretty, 44, who resigned from his position as group finance director
of Budgens in January, has turned up in the same position at discounter Kwik
Save.
Chief executive Graeme Seabrook says Pretty was 'clearly the best candidate'
the headhunters produced. Acknowledging that his departure from Budgens was
'one of the question marks I had', Seabrook admits he checked him out
thoroughly. However, he found that 'Derek clearly arrived there after the
damage had been done, and did a pretty good job trying to sort it out'.
A year into Pretty's Budgens stint, institutions forced out the chief
executive, and ushered in another set of managers. Seabrook established that
'the new team simply had one finance guy too many'.
Pretty's retailing experience, which spans J Sainsbury, Waterstone and
Kingfisher, appealed to Kwik Save in its search for a replacement for Simon
Moffat who departs for Hillsdown Holdings.
Seabrook describes Pretty's new assignment mainly as 'keeping the show on
the road. Moffat has spent the last 18 months successfully bedding down the
various parts of the job'. Before Moffat, Kwik Save did not have a group
finance director.

FT  11 MAY 92 / The Week Ahead: Results due
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
NEXT week should provide some much-needed first-hand evidence about whether
the UK is finally pulling out of recession as some of the most influential
retailers report results and comment on the consumer's state of health.
On Tuesday, Marks and Spencer, which has been riding the rough trading
better than most, is likely to edge profits 2 per cent higher to Pounds
635m. The company is also expected to make an announcement about the future
of its loss-making Canadian operations. M and S's solid cost base and proven
management skills should have enabled it to combat a loss of market share.
But clothing margins will have been hit by widespread discounting elsewhere
and the food business will have felt the force of furious expansion
programmes of the big supermarket chains.
One of these, J. Sainsbury, is likely to boast of a more buoyant trading
picture the following day as annual profits are likely to surge by more than
20 per cent to the Pounds 610m mark.
But Burton Group, the ill-starred fashion retailer which has seen two chief
executives depart in as many years, is only likely to confirm the pattern of
its recent grim trading fortunes when it reports on Wednesday. Morgan
Stanley suggests interim profits will be near Pounds 20m - with only a token
dividend - and predicts a sharp reverse in the second half. Grand
Metropolitan, the food, drinks and retailing group, is expected on Thursday
to lay the foundations for the further 'year of progress' promised by Sir
Allen Sheppard, chairman. A 3 per cent rise in interim pre-tax profits to
about Pounds 390m is forecast with IDV, the drinks division, leading the
way.
British Gas is expected to report a drop in its first quarter net income on
Thursday to Pounds 630m from Pounds 729m in the same period last year,
according to forecasts by County NatWest, the Edinburgh-based brokers. The
company saw profits eroded by warmer winter weather and lower gas production
at its Morecambe Bay field.
Royal Dutch-Shell, the Anglo-Dutch oil company, is estimated to have made a
profit of Pounds 685m in the first quarter on a replacement cost basis which
strips out stock losses and gains. This is half the level made in the same
1991 period when income was Pounds 1.22bn. The company is expected to be hit
by a weakening in refining margins , particularly in the Far East and a loss
in its chemicals division as well as lower gas prices.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The rapid rise of Tony Pedder in the British Steel hierarchy is confirmed by
his appointment to the main board at the relatively youthful age of 42.
Pedder is one of three younger career steel men promoted to an increasingly
elderly boardroom just a few months before Sir Robert Scholey, the
70-year-old chairman, retires.
Pedder, who joined the group in 1971, is the most senior of the three new
faces joining the board. He was made managing director of British Steel
Stainless in November 1987 and in October 1991 moved to be managing director
British Steel Commercial and Distribution.
Harold Homer, the 51-year-old managing director of British Steel General
Steels, and John McDowall, the 50-year-old managing director of British
Steel Strip Products, have also been promoted to the board. McDowall, a
Scotsman, began his steel career at Ravenscraig in 1967, and Yorkshire-born
Homer joined the Park Gate Iron and Steel Company in 1957.
Apart from reducing the average age of the 16-strong board, the arrival of
the three new executive directors means the boardroom is no longer dominated
by non-executive directors.

FT  11 MAY 92 / Economics: UK retail price index may show significant
inflation increase
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
VARIOUS WAYS of measuring inflation in Britain will come under the spotlight
this week as economists pore over data relating to the pace of the hesitant
recovery that seems to be under way.
Much attention will be focused on the retail prices index for April, to be
released by the Central Statistical Office on Friday. Many economists
believe the index rose by about 4.4 per cent in the 12 months to April.
This would mark a significant increase in so-called headline inflation,
which registered 4 per cent in the year to March.
Although various technical factors are likely to account for any rise of
this sort, signs that inflationary pressures have not disappeared worry many
in the economics profession who feel Britain has not done enough to erase
the psychology of rising prices.
Average earnings
On Tuesday the CSO publishes other figures for inflation as measured by the
prices of factory goods for UK consumption at the wholesale level,while on
Thursday the Employment Department is due to give its estimate of the
underlying rise in average earnings for the year to March.
Economists interested in clues as to the strength of the US upturn will
eagerly await details to be issued on Friday of US industrial production
last month.
The following are the highlights of notable events and statistics over the
next few days. Numbers in brackets are market forecasts, provided by
financial information company MMS.

FT  11 MAY 92 / Construction Contracts: New stand for rugby stadium
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The construction of the new 25,000 seater East Stand at Twickenham has been
awarded by the Rugby Football Union to MOWLEM SOUTH EAST, a division of John
Mowlem Construction.
Structurally, the new East Stand will be identical to the North Stand,
successfully completed by Mowlem at the end of 1990. It will provide
uninterrupted views of the playing area by means of a 39 metre cantilevered
tubular steel roof, supported by large concrete columns at the rear of the
stand. This design also achieves continuity of seating and weather
protection.
Work will begin on site shortly and the lower tier seating 10,000 spectators
will be available for the England versus South Africa match on November 14
this year. The remainder of the stand will be completed by the end of
October 1993.
The new stand will increase Twickenham's capacity from around 60,000 at
present to nearly 69,000 - the second step towards the Rugby Football
Union's goal of a 75,000 capacity all-seated stadium.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Wimpey's specialist offshore engineers have begun an operation to avert
toxic danger to marine life in the Atlantic Ocean.
Underwater grouting supplied by the transatlantic arm of WIMPEY GEOTECH is
forming the nucleus of a USDollars 6m (Pounds 3.3m) salvage operation to
recover toxic chemicals off Cape May in New Jersey.
Four containers holding a total of 441 drums of arsenic trioxide and sodium
cyanide slipped from the decks of carqo vessel Santa Clara 1 during a storm
in January 1992.
The containers settled 30 miles offshore, spilling the drums in a prime
fishing zone which is also the habitat of the endangered Right whale and the
Kemp Ridley sea turtle.
Working at depths of 40 metres, remote control vehicles fitted with robotic
arms will place the chemical drums into oversized caskets. The space around
the drums will then be filled with a high density cement grout mixed by
Wimpey Geotech on board the recovery vessel and pumped into place using
specialist equipment and services. The grout will be allowed to harden
before the caskets are brought to the surface for salvage and safe disposal.
Work started in March and is expected to continue for three months.

FT  11 MAY 92 / Construction Contracts: Upgrading buildings in London
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The TRAFALGAR HOUSE construction companies have recently won contracts
together worth Pounds 12.2m.
The largest, worth Pounds 6.8m, has been awarded to Trollope &amp; CoIls (City)
by Northern Telecom Europe. Work involves refurbishing and partly
demolishing the old Standard Telephone Company's 48 acre New Southgate
complex, in London N11.
This phased programme will give 16,000 sq metres of prime air-conditioned
office space in phase one and phase two will provide another l,300 sq metres
within the 1930s buildings.
Work has already begun on the early stages of the 49-week contract with
completion programmed for January 1993.
At 67-73 Worship Street, EC2, Trollope &amp; CoIls (City) is to build a
four-storey extension, for occupation by The Quick Corporation, under a
Pounds 2.4m contract from Taisei Europe.
Other contracts include a refurbishment project at Touche Ross' Hill House
headquarters and a fit-out and refurbishment for insurance brokers Murray
Lawrence Holdings.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE newly formed Amalgamated Engineering and Electrical Union may become the
focus of a Trades Union Congress row over the recruitment of a non-TUC
breakaway group of airline cabin staff.
The row may jeopardise the readmittance to the TUC of the electricians'
section of the new union, formed by the amalgamation of the EETPU
electricians' and the AEU engineering unions. The EETPU was expelled by the
TUC in 1988.
The electricians' section has disclosed that, over the past few days, it has
agreed to provide services 'on an agency basis in the first stage' to Cabin
Crew '89. The 5,000-strong cabin crew group broke away from the TGWU general
union in 1989.
Initially - and controversially - Cabin Crew '89 was given financial support
by Balpa, the airline officers' association.
Cabin Crew '89, which consists mainly of British Airways staff, has now
severed its links with Balpa and has turned to the white-collar section of
the electricians' grouping within the AEEU. The electricians will provide
support services at first.
The EETPU section of the AEEU said yesterday that the arrangement had 'not
been entered into to be provocative or controversial' but was between 'one
non-TUC-affiliated trade union and another non-TUC-affiliated union'.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE National Communications Union is making progress in extending its
membership beyond BT and the Post Office and has won a foothold in the cable
TV industry and at Butlin's, the leisure company, according to a union
recruitment circular.
If UK union membership as a proportion of the working population is not to
dwindle to US levels, unions such as the NCU must expand out of their
shrinking, union-friendly heartlands and seek members in smaller companies
in communications and services. Mr Alan Harley, NCU national organiser, has
reported that the 150,000-strong union is well on the way to surpassing its
modest target of recruiting 1,000 members outside BT and the Post Office by
the end of 1992.
He warns, though, that external recruitment, which he believes might be as
high as 8,000 by the end of 1994, may slow in the light of Labour's general
election defeat.
The NCU has recruited 350 members in Mercury, the main BT competitor, after
visiting only 10 out of the 70 main sites, but the three-year aim of
recruiting up to half Mercury's 7,000 eligible staff may be over-optimistic.
Of the 159 cable TV franchise holders, the union has won one 'access
agreement' for membership recruitment at CUC, a Canadian-owned company, and
hopes to conclude two more in the next few weeks. It has 100 members in the
cable companies and hopes to have 700 by the end of 1993.
Other areas of recruitment include Butlin's central reservations office,
where the union has 51 members, and Telecom Security, a BT subsidiary, where
the NCU is holding a recognition ballot.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
NUMERICAL TARGETS for the recruitment of black people should be set for all
parts of the criminal justice system, the National Association for the Care
and Resettlement of Offenders (Nacro) says in a report published today.
It says about 2 per cent of magistrates are black and that only two out of
451 circuit judges and six out of 772 recorders are black. In contrast, 16
per cent of the male and 28 per cent of the female prison population are
from ethnic minorities.
Black people are 'severely under-represented' among staff in prisons,
probation services, the legal profession, the judiciary and magistracy,
Nacro says. There is also a 'very disturbing over-representation' of black
people on the receiving end of justice.

SIX incendiary devices ignited early today in the Gateshead MetroCentre,
Europe's largest shopping complex. Three others were found and made safe by
bomb disposal officers. The police said the fires had caused minimal damage
to stores and that no one had been hurt.
'These were professional devices,' Mr David Mellish, assistant chief
constable for Northumbria. 'They would have caused serious fire damage and
could have resulted in serious loss of life had they gone off this afternoon
when the centre was crowded.'
The centre was evacuated when two firebombs were discovered, and fires
caused by other devices broke out as police were searching premises.
No warnings were given, and police were unable to say when the devices were
planted or who was responsible. The incendiaries, which contained timing
devices, were thought to be similar to devices planted in shopping centres
at Blackpool, Manchester and north London in December.

TWO THIRDS of the UK's top companies have links with countries that are
abusers of human rights, according to a report published today, Scheherazade
Daneshkhu writes.
The Ethical Investment Research Service (Eiris) which screens companies for
private investors to see whether they meet certain ethical criteria, says
that 36 of the 50 largest UK companies are involved.
'Many UK company groups have subsidiary and associated companies all over
the world,' Eiris says. 'By operating in a country, the company group is
making a direct investment in that country's economy.'
The survey covers all 590 companies in the FTA All-Share Index at the end of
last year. It found that 200 had subsidiary or associated companies in one
or more of the countries identified, while 31 companies had significant
subsidiaries in countries with high levels of human rights abuses.
They included Thorn-EMI, the electronics group, which employs 340 people in
a subsidiary in Mexico, a country from which Amnesty International has
received reports of torture. The report also cites Tate and Lyle which has
subsidiaries or associated companies in Kenya, Somalia, South Africa, Sri
Lanka and Sudan, all of which suffer human rights abuses.
The top 50 companies by market value which are not identified by the
oppressive-regime criteria used by Eiris are: Abbey National, Argyll Group,
Associated British Foods, BAA, British Gas, Eurotunnel, Kingfisher, Land
Securities, Marks and Spencer, National Power, Reuters Holdings, J.
Sainsbury, Tesco and Vodafone Group.

FT  11 MAY 92 / Middle East: Weapons deals hit prospects for Mideast
stability
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
HOPES for a more stable Middle East after Iraq's defeat in the Gulf war are
buckling under the sheer weight of some Dollars 30bn (Pounds 16.7bn) in
proposed new arms transfers - with the US among the main culprits in
speeding deliveries to the region.
President George Bush's much-vaunted arms control initiative of May 1991 -
in which he urged the world's five leading powers to limit arms sales to the
Middle East - appears to be running into the sand.
According to the US Arms Control Association, Washington has proposed
Dollars 6bn in weapons transfers since the initiative was announced, and
Dollars 19bn worth of arms in total since the end of the Gulf war itself,
with Saudi Arabia alone ordering Dollars 15bn worth of new equipment.
Iran and Syria are also in the vanguard of arms purchases. Both are taking
advantage of bargain prices available for surplus equipment from the former
Soviet Union and its east European satellites.
Military analysts say that in part the arms build-up follows an
uninterrupted trend in the Middle East, where superpower and regional
rivalries have historically made the region one of the world's main arms
markets. But they believe it also reflects strategic uncertainties since the
Gulf war.
'There's nothing like an inconclusive war to stimulate arms sales,' says Mr
Nicholas Protonotarius of the International Institute of Strategic Studies
in London. 'And this was an inconclusive war.'
Since the war, every country in the region has been left with its own
reasons to buy arms - either for defence or to secure its regional
ambitions.
The Gulf states are arming defensively to ensure they are never again as
vulnerable to invasion; Iran is re-arming from a low base after its
destructive war with Iraq, but also with an eye on spreading its influence
regionally; Syria is seeking by its missile acquisitions to bridge the vast
gap in its capabilities vis-a-vis Israel, which has itself always placed a
high priority in maintaining military superiority over its neighbours.
Turkey, also with its eyes on a strategic role in the region, is meanwhile
developing its own arms manufacturing industry.
While the Stockholm-based International Peace Research Institute (Sipri)
noted recently that there had been been a significant fall in the value of
transfers to the Middle East, from Dollars 14bn in 1987 (the last full year
of the Iran-Iraq war) to Dollars 5bn in 1991, these figures ignore the real
tension caused by the continued sale of ballistic missiles to states such as
Syria, together with fears that the collapse of the Soviet Union will enable
the unauthorised transfer of nuclear and other weapons technology.
Moreover, much of the fall in the value of arms sales to the region is
accounted for by the embargo against Iraq, which alone imported Dollars 27bn
worth of weapons in the decade to 1990.
Nothing perhaps better illustrates barriers to Middle East arms control than
the lethargic response to Mr Bush's initiative, in which he called for a
register of arms sales to the region, barriers to exports that contribute to
weapons of mass destruction, a freeze - followed by a ban - on
surface-to-surface missiles in the region, and a ban on the production of
nuclear weapons material.
Arms suppliers, notably the UN Security Council's five permanent members,
were urged to avoid destabilising deals and asked to tighten export
controls. But in the case of China, Mr Bush's pleas have apparently fallen
on deaf ears. China's continuing reluctance to abide by the Missile
Technology Control Regime (MTRC), a western initiative aimed at stopping the
proliferation of missile technology, is a serious drag on efforts to halt
the spread of ballistic missiles.
At the same time, diplomatic efforts to create the anti-Saddam coalition in
the Gulf war also helped make available to many countries in the region
considerably more money to spend on arms.
Arms supplies have also been boosted by the eagerness with which east
European countries, particularly Czechoslovakia and Bulgaria, have sought to
earn hard currency through weapon sales. Through such trade, arms experts
believe, weapons such as sophisticated T-72 tanks may be changing hands for
as little as Dollars 600,000 each - less than half the price they were two
years ago. 'There are signs that Russia and the east Europeans can't abide
by this (arms control) regime because of their foreign exchange needs,' says
Professor Trevor Taylor of the Royal Institute for International Affairs in
London.
This sudden availability of advanced weaponry is fuelling the traditional
vicious circle that has long characterised the regional arms race. Arab
states want to erode Israel's 'qualitative edge', but Israel in turn seeks
to extend it by developing and acquiring bigger and better systems.
'The old Soviet bloc was always very cautious about releasing new arms
technology but now it doesn't seem to bother them,' says an Israeli
intelligence official. 'They are ready to sell top-line Mig 29 aircraft, the
latest T-72 tanks and advanced surface-to-air missiles. This is new and it
is a worrying trend.'
Israel's response has been to embark on its own quest for more sophisticated
firepower. Projects such as the development of the joint US-Israeli Arrow
ballistic missile interceptor and a home-grown intelligence satellite and
integrated radar defence systems have been given priority.
'Smart' bombs, missiles and artillery shells - of the type used so
spectacularly in the war against Iraq - are being developed, refined and
bought. 'In the long run it will produce a much more sophisticated, more
state-of-the-art army,' says a military official.
Reports that Israel may have transferred unauthorised US missile technology
to China, which in turn may have incorporated it in weapons sold to Arab
states, plus the recent publicity given to a shipment of North Korean
missiles to Iran and Syria, have drawn further attention to issues of
technology 'leakage' and proliferation of weapons systems to the volatile
Middle East.
Iran has been the focus of much of this concern, notably since recent
British press reports, which echoed claims by a US Republican congressional
task force on terrorism and unconventional warfare, suggesting Tehran has
acquired two tactical nuclear warheads from the former Soviet Central Asian
states. Driven by its historic enmity withIraq and still smarting from
defeat in the 1980-88 Gulf war, Iran has the motive and the means to acquire
its own nuclear device.
Military analysts suggest it should not be surprising if Middle Eastern
states seek nuclear weapons, given Israel's cache of up to 100 nuclear
warheads and, indeed, revelations about the extent of Iraq's nuclear weapons
programme.
In this respect there are particular worries in the west about China and
North Korea as suppliers of nuclear and other advanced weapons technology to
the area. A recent study of China's missile trade by the California-based
Monterrey Institute of International Studies found that Chinese missile
co-operation with developing states in terms of 'whole systems and
subsystems, production assistance and technology transfer' represented the
world's most comprehensive programme of providing missile know-how to such
countries.
It charged that China was assisting in the creation of new and powerful
missile-producing states which are likely to operate outside any limitations
(international or otherwise) on the sales of such systems.
The glaring example was North Korea, which had become a prime supplier of
missiles and missile technology to the Middle East, including Syria, Libya,
Iran, Egypt and possibly Iraq.
International pressure may have obliged China to defer shipments of the M-9
short-range missile to Syria, for which a contract was signed between
Damascus and Beijing in 1987, but there is no sign the Chinese have
abandoned plans to supply the missile. Indeed, reports this year that China
had shipped to Syria chemicals suitable for production of solid-fuel
missiles, allied with sightings of M-9 missile launchers in Syria, prompted
speculation that the M-9 transfer is proceeding despite international
pressure.
An abiding US fear is that the positioning of substantial numbers of M-9
missiles in Syria - the missiles have a range of about 500km - raises the
prospect of an Israeli pre-emptive strike, and thus the danger of a new
Middle East war.
Israeli officials say they are uncertain of the status of the M-9 deal. But
they have repeatedly voiced public concern about up to 80 Scud-C missiles
and 12 launchers they believe are being delivered to Syria by North Korea.
Such spectres point up the desirability of some form of arms control regime
in the region. But not only is there no such regime; the circumstances are
auspicious neither for the imposition of one from outside, nor for
development from within the region.
President Hafez el-Assad of Syria has already made it clear that he opposes
US attempts to limit Syria's ability to buy whatever weapons it likes, at
least while Israel remains immune from western attempts to control arms in
the region.
For many analysts, no arms control regime will succeed in the area until
there is a solution to the Arab-Israeli conflict. Arms control will be
discussed in Washington in the next three days in the multilateral round of
the Middle East peace talks - but no substantive progress on arms control is
likely until the main item on the agenda, peace between Arab and Israeli,
has made substantial progress.
In the end, though, no amount of initiatives may succeed in dissuading the
jostling powers of the region from buying exactly what they feel they need
both for regional power and for their own defence.
As Mr Don Kerr, analyst with Control Risks, the private defence consultants,
says: 'Military procurement has its own inertia - it's something countries
can never stop doing.'

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Indian monetary authorities were anxiously attempting yesterday to
prevent an uncontrolled slide in stock prices as fresh financial scandals
undermined investor confidence.
In an escalating series of disclosures now touching some of the major
financial institutions, it was revealed on Saturday that Mr MJ Pherwani, the
chairman of the National Housing Bank (NHB), had resigned after his bank
failed to make payments due of Rs3.4bn (Pounds 65.9m) on purchases of
government securities.
Last week NHB, a subsidiary of the Reserve Bank of India, the country's
central bank, was unable to meet payments due to Canbank Mutual Fund and
Deutsche Bank on inter-bank promissory notes known locally as bankers'
receipts. These are notes which banks have issued to each other to register
the transfer of government securities because of long delays in the Reserve
Bank's own clearance system.
Mr Pherwani's resignation is seen as an ominous signal because he took a
strongly bullish view of the market when chairman of the Unit Trust of India
(UTI), the largest state-owned mutual fund.
NHB was to have paid Rs3.4bn to Canbank with funds owed to it by Mr Harshad
Mehta, the Bombay broker whose activities are now under investigation by a
government-appointed committee of inquiry. Mr Mehta was recently forced by
State Bank of India, the largest state-owned bank, to settle payment on
Rs6.2bn of bankers' receipts. This precipitated the slide in stock prices.
Until reaching a peak on April 22, the Bombay stock market had more than
trebled in value over the last year. Since the slide began, the index has
fallen 18 per cent.
The fears now are that Mr Pherwani's resignation will have a chain effect as
other banks come under scrutiny.
Bankers believe that there could be as much as Rs30bn-Rs40bn of outstanding
loans issued as bankers' receipts to finance stock purchases.

FILIPINOS go to the polls today to elect a president to replace Mrs Corazon
Aquino after a campaign marked by growing violence and accusations of
intimidation and intended fraud.
Police said communist rebels of the New People's Army killed 17 policemen
yesterday in a dawn ambush in the northern province of Cagayan, and seven
civilians were reported to have been killed by two explosions on Saturday at
campaign rallies on the southern island of Mindanao. Violence elsewhere took
the weekend death toll to 28.
The various political and family factions competing in the elections for the
presidency, the vice-presidency, the congress and some 17,000 local
government posts have accused one another of sending death threats and
planning to stuff ballot boxes, and the climate of instability has prompted
fears of a coup.
The violence and the recriminations, however, did little to dampen the
enthusiasm of voters attending flamboyant weekend rallies enlivened by
firework displays, popular music and the appearance of local film stars  - a
crucial ingredient for electoral success in the Philippines.
Among the seven presidential candidates are Mr Ramon Mitra, the speaker of
the House of Representatives and standard-bearer of the majority party in
congress, the Laban ng Democratikong Pilipino, and Mr Fidel Ramos, the
former defence chief backed by Mrs Aquino. Mrs Imelda Marcos is also
standing, but her chances are regarded as slim.

NINE government and opposition parties agreed over the weekend to amend
Thailand's constitution in an attempt to end a month-long crisis, but the
country's largest protests in two decades continued.
The protesters accepted the proposed changes but wanted the government to
set a clear timetable, particularly for an amendment that would prevent the
appointment of a non-elected prime minister.
Crowd numbers reached 100,000 in late night rallies on Friday and Saturday
and about 50,000 last night.
General Suchinda Kraprayoon, the prime minister and target of the protests,
said he had no objection to the amendments but did not specify when the
changes would take place.
Protesters, objecting to the military domination of politics, continued to
call for his resignation. He was the architect of last year's coup d'etat
and was appointed prime minister after the March 22 general election, even
though he did not stand. Critics say the five-party coalition that backs him
was created by military power brokers.
The weekend passed peacefully despite some potentially explosive situations,
with the government appearing determined to avoid violence. The
English-language newspaper Bangkok Post said this was because of a special
request from King Bhumibol Adulyadej, who is highly revered.

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Bush administration's response to disturbances in Los Angeles will be
based on the principles of 'law enforcement, opportunity and values',
according to Mr Dan Quayle, US vice-president.
Mr Quayle yesterday said President George Bush had told him on Saturday that
the most important message he had picked up on his two-day tour of the
riot-stricken city last week was the respect that people had for the Los
Angeles Police Department and for those who had come in to restore law and
order. 'We are going to stand up for the law abiding, tax-paying Americans
who contribute to the community,' Mr Quayle insisted.
The vice-president promised a more activist administration approach, but no
new programmes. Gun control, for example, was not part of the solution, he
said. 'Many of the Koreans in Los Angeles were glad they had guns,' he said
in a television interview.
He reiterated existing administration policies - including the creation of
enterprise zones, wider home ownership and choice in education - as the
correct response to inner-city problems. Most of these had been low on the
White House political agenda before the Los Angeles disturbances, but Mr
Quayle urged Congress to act on them swiftly.
Mr Bush is travelling to Philadelphia today presumably to deliver a similar
message, although perhaps without the harder, more conservative edge
associated with his vice-president. He has scheduled a meeting with
congressional leaders tomorrow to discuss legislative action.
The president's political advisers are conscious of the risk, in an election
year, of being too passive in responding to events in Los Angeles. However,
the administration is patently divided between orthodox conservative
philosophy, represented by Mr Quayle and emphasising law and order, and the
more interventionist policy ideas advocated by Mr Jack Kemp, housing
secretary, for the last three years without much success.
This internal tension explains why Mr Bush's own responses over the past 10
days have been so variable. These have ranged from a near acceptance that
the acquittal of the policemen accused of beating Mr Rodney King was a
miscarriage of justice to blaming inner-city problems on the liberal Great
Society programmes enacted in the 1960s.
Mr Kemp said yesterday that the 'Great Society did not cause the Los Angeles
riots'. He said it had provided 'the net below which people should not fall,
but not the ladder by which they could climb'.

TRADE ministers from the Group of Seven industrialised nations spelt out at
the weekend actions needed from the countries of eastern Europe and the
former Soviet Union to attract more foreign investment.
They also agreed that western economies must open their markets to more
imports from the former communist states.
The list of necessary measures - including the legal protection of foreign
investment and private property, reliable banking systems, clear rules on
responsibility for environmental damage, and well-defined contract laws -
was agreed with economics and trade ministers from the seven most important
eastern economies at an 'east-west trade summit' in Munster.
It amounts to a deliberate move by the G7 countries to strengthen the hands
of market reformers in eastern Europe, when facing hostility to foreign
investment.
However, the most substantive result to emerge from the two-day conference,
organised by Mr Jurgen Mollemann, German economics minister, in his home
town, was a separate deal between Germany and Russia allowing the resumption
of Hermes export credit guarantees on German exports.
In bilateral discussions, Mr Andrei Nechayev, Russian economics minister,
was able to satisfy his German counterpart that Russia would give
governmental counter-guarantees for Hermes-backed trade, the absence of
which has effectively blocked new contracts for German exports since the
collapse of the Soviet Union.
The deal means that guarantees from Hermes, Bonn's leading export credit
agency, can now be given up to a ceiling of DM5bn (Pounds 1.7bn) this year,
although this level will be reviewed every three months. German exporters,
above all those from former East Germany, have been badly hit by the absence
of export credit insurance to Russia.
Ms Barbara Franklin, US commerce secretary, said after the conference that
the eastern delegates welcomed pressure for a reliable legal framework for
foreign investment.
Mr Nechayev admitted the Russian parliament, more conservative and
suspicious of economic reform than the government, had held up passage of
such legislation. He hoped a satisfactory legal framework for investors
would soon be in place.

FT  11 MAY 92 / Russia delays fixing rouble exchange rate: Anthony Robinson
and Martin Wolf on moves to convertibility
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY ROBINSON and MARTIN WOLF
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE 'difficult and tremendous task' of fixing the rouble exchange rate
within a 7 1/2 per cent fluctuation band on either side of a central rate
will not be attempted until 'some time this autumn', according to Mr Georgy
Matiukhin, chairman of the Central Bank of Russia. The government had
earlier indicated its intention to fix the rouble on August 1.
The first stage of Russia's 'serious move towards convertibility of the
rouble' is to begin on July 1 with the abolition of multiple exchange rates
and the introduction of a unitary floating rate of exchange.
After presiding over a meeting of the governing council of the
re-capitalised Moscow Narodny Bank in London on Friday, Mr Matiukhin made
clear that convertibility would have to be backed by a tight credit policy.
In addition, a sophisticated system of currency exchanges must be created
throughout Russia and the other republics of the former Soviet Union, backed
by adequate communications and staffed by people who have so far not been
trained.
Mr Matiukhin said there would be no special exchange rate for capital
transactions, but non-residents would not be allowed to buy the rouble
freely until it had appreciated from present undervalued levels and could be
fixed. So-called 'cashless' rouble accounts should also be made convertible
into cash before floating commences.
Mr Matiukhin said he had emphasised to the central banks of the other
republics that the rouble was the national currency of Russia. Preparations
for the introduction of convertibility - to be initially limited to current
account transactions for Russian residents only, and later extended to
residents of other republics and to capital inflows - had already led to
closer co-operation between republican central banks.
'Many of them used not to turn up for sessions of the inter-republican
central bank council. But all 15, including the Baltic republics, Ukraine
and others who are contemplating issuing their own currencies, turned up at
the last meeting,' he said.
Rules on the distribution of cash, common interest rates and common
obligatory reserve ratios had already been agreed. They had also established
correspondent accounts between central banks, which resemble a payments
union. 'Now what we are trying to agree is the limits on mutual credit.'
Limits on credit expansion will be needed in all the republics in what he
called the 'rouble zone'.
The impending steep rise in the price of Russian oil and energy products
will increase the balance-of-payments deficits of most of the 14 non-Russian
republics with Russia. This will intensify their need for Russian financial
assistance, which will only be available if they remain in the rouble zone.
The other republics will also have to increase their exports to Russia to
reduce their deficits.
Though the Baltic republics are expected to be the first to issue their own
currencies they are 'likely to be like the Scottish pound to start with', Mr
Matiukhin said, in a reference to the way some Scottish banks retain the
right to issue bank notes, but under Bank of England control.
He also said that the International Monetary Fund agreed with Russia on the
need to preserve the rouble zone. The Group of Seven industrialised
countries had decided to channel most of the promised Dollars 24bn aid
package through Russia.

TURKEY has called for the United Nations Security Council to intervene in
Nagorno-Karabakh, amid intensified fighting in the disputed Armenian enclave
in Azerbaijan.
Under growing domestic pressure to side with the Moslem Azeris, Turkey
warned Armenia not to make any move to redraw the borders, following reports
of the fall of the last Azeri stronghold.
The latest fighting shatters a ceasefire brokered by Iran and signed in
Tehran on Friday by Azerbaijani President Yagub Mamedov and Armenian
President Levon Ter-Petrosian.
Officials confirmed Turkey had sent a letter to the UN after making a strong
comment on the conflict, which has claimed more than 1,500 lives over the
past four years.
'We want the UN to send observers to Nagorno-Karabakh and start working on a
ceasefire. . . The Republic of Turkey will not accept the redrawing of the
borders by the use of force,' said Mr Erdal Inonu, Turkey's deputy prime
minister, after an emergency cabinet meeting on Saturday.
Turkey's warning follows renewed hostilities over the weekend and news that
Armenian forces had taken control of Shusha, a strategic Azeri town
overlooking the regional capital Stepanakert. Azerbaijan said yesterday it
was battling to retake the town, in the mountainous Caucasian region.

<TEXT>
SERB irregular forces, backed by the Yugoslav federal army, yesterday
tightened their grip around Sarajevo, the capital of Bosnia-Hercegovina,
after a weekend of heavy fighting in which 43 people were injured and
several buildings, including the Bosnian Red Cross, were set ablaze.
The siege of the city coincided with the publication of new casualty
figures. Mr Haris Smajkic, a Bosnian health ministry official, yesterday
said at least 1,320 people had been killed, 6,700 wounded and 1,900 reported
missing since the fighting began six weeks ago. In addition, 320,000 people
have been displaced, and over 350,000 have left the war-torn republic since
it declared independence last month.
The repeated air and artillery bombardment of Sarajevo signals a determined
effort by the Serb-dominated Yugoslav army to crush resistance by Bosnian
Territorial Defence forces. These forces are mostly Moslem and Croats.
The appointment of General Ratko Mladic, who yesterday replaced Gen Milutin
Kukanjac as commander of the federal army headquarters in Sarajevo, confirms
an even more aggressive stance by the federal army.
Gen Mladic was the hardline federal army commander of the Knin corps, a
Serb-stronghold in Croatia. He is also a close ally of Mr Radovan Karadzic,
the leader of Bosnia's Serbian Democratic party, whose own paramilitary wing
is besieging Sarajevo.
As Serb irregulars wage a war of attrition on the Bosnian capital, all food
supplies to the inhabitants of the city have been halted. Serb gunmen have
erected road blocks on all routes leading to Sarajevo. The federal army
controls the airport. Both forces have completely blocked the delivery of
medicines. Bosnian health officials say blood and medical supplies have been
exhausted.
The constant artillery assaults have badly damaged the city
telecommunications network, and Radio Sarajevo regularly carries desperate
messages from people trying to contact missing relatives.
Serb forces have also repeatedly attacked Sarajevo radio and television
transmitters, to try to further erode the authority of the Bosnian
government.
The government is backed by the republic's Moslems, who make up 44 per cent
of the republic's 4.35m population.
A witness yesterday described the grim existence of the inhabitants of the
city, whose peace-time population is 525,000. He said: 'People leave their
shelters during a lull in the fighting. They go outside to try to keep up
some sort of a life. But shells fall around them and snipers will shoot at
anything.'
Bosnian leaders have again appealed for the despatch of United Nations
peacekeepers and foreign military intervention.
Elsewhere in the republic, the south-western city of Mostar is also under
attack.
The European Community and the US so far have ruled out military
intervention.

RIOT police in the former Soviet republic of Tajikistan opened fire on a

wounding many more, witnesses said, Reuter reports from Dushanbe.
Interfax news agency quoted General Anatoly Martovitsky, head of
Tajikistan's national border guards, as saying a crowd of armed people had
tried to break into the KGB building, where some government officials have
been hiding since the conservative leadership, under President Rakhmon
Nabiyev, collapsed last week.
Police initially fired warning shots in the air, but their fire was returned
from the crowd, Gen Martovitsky said.
The police then fired directly into the crowd, which scattered.
There were dead and wounded on both sides, he added.
The shooting shattered a brief period of calm which followed Thursday's
victory by Moslem and democratic forces protesting against the government of
the central Asian state.

SUPPORTERS of Iran's pragmatic President Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani have
won a landslide victory in parliamentary elections, routing radicals who had
opposed economic reforms and a gradual opening to the west.
In Friday's second round of balloting, candidates with the president's
backing achieved a virtual clean sweep in the crucial Tehran area, which
contributes 30 representatives to the 270-member majlis (parliament).
Candidates sympathetic to Mr Rafsanjani's relatively moderate policies were
also successful in provincial areas.
About three quarters of the parliamentarians are expected to be Rafsanjani
supporters. Counting is expected to be completed early this week.
Mr Rafsanjani is an advocate of economic liberalisation, while his opponents
favour continuing state control and a programme of subsidies to protect the
living standards of the poor.
Mr Mohammed Javid Larijani, foreign policy adviser to Mr Rafsanjani, and Mr
Rajai Khorassani, Iran's former United Nations representative, were among
the moderates elected.
Both Iranian and western observers are describing the result as a slap in
the face for the militants who have presented themselves as the true heirs
to the radical line of Iran's late spiritual leader Ayatollah Khomeini.

</HEADLINE>

   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Pierre Beregovoy, the French prime minister, yesterday warned that Europe
would come apart unless France showed the lead and ratified the Maastricht
Treaty on European Union.
French politicians who opposed the treaty on grounds of national sovereignty
were living in the wrong era, said Mr Beregovoy, in his first full-length
television debate since becoming prime minister on April 2.
'If the treaty is not ratified by France, which in my view must show the
way, or by any other country, then Europe risks coming apart,' he said.
'Germany, which is today integrated into Europe. . . could be at that moment
left to follow its own free will,' he added.
Mr Beregovoy's remarks came ahead of a national assembly vote due tomorrow
on the constitutional changes required by the treaty in the first step
towards ratification.
A majority is expected to vote in favour, but the government has been
surprised by a larger than expected minority, mostly on the right, against
the European Community generally. Nearly half the Gaullist members of
parliament - led by Mr Philippe Seguin, the MP for Vosges in north-east
France - came out in favour of throwing out the treaty.
Mr Seguin's arguments belonged to the time of Bismarck, said Mr Beregovoy,
referring to the 19th century German chancellor.
The constitutional changes are due to go to the senate, the upper house of
parliament, on May 20, and then for ratification by a joint sitting of both
houses, known as the congress, next month.
Mr Beregovoy thought it possible that the treaty might also have to go to a
national referendum, though this was 'not indispensable'.
A referendum is needed if the project fails to get a three-fifths majority
in the congress. However, Mr Beregovoy said the government would also
consider whether a referendum was desirable in the light of the
parliamentary debate.
Until now, the government has appeared against a referendum on the grounds
that it might produce another protest vote against President Francois
Mitterrand, instead of an accurate public opinion on the treaty itself.

FT  11 MAY 92 / Berlusconi denounces capping of TV receipts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Silvio Berlusconi, the Italian media magnate, has angrily denounced a
decision by a watchdog body capping his television advertising receipts.
The potential loss to Mr Berlusconi's Fininvest group this year could be
L300bn (Pounds 136m). Over the weekend Mr Berlusconi said he would be
contesting the decision in the courts.
The cap was imposed by Prof Giuseppe Santaniello, who acts as the media
ombudsman. In a long judgment, he claimed that the dominant position reached
by Mr Berlusconi's televison stations in the advertising market was limiting
competition.
Mr Berlusconi's main channels - Channel 5, Italia I and Network (Rete) 4 -
account for 56.8 per cent of all Italian television advertising. With his
smaller channels such as Junior TV and Italia 7, his group controls 60.1 per
cent.
The three channels of RAI, the state-owned television, generate only 28 per
cent of total television advertising, while Tele Monte Carlo, the next most
important private group, accounts for only 3 per cent.
In February Prof Santaniello began considering a complaint lodged against
the monopoly position of Fininvest by some 30 newspaper and magazines
publishers and TV station owners. The complaint addressed Mr Berlusconi's
position in the print media (he controls magazines and a newspaper) as well
as TV as a result of his acquisition of control of the Mondadori publishing
groupin April 1991.
The publishers were concerned that in a declining market where television
was taking an increasing share from the print media, Mr Berlusconi had
acquired a position where he could dictate prices and profit unfairly from
the synergy of his group.
The television networks claimed Mr Berlusconi was undercutting rates because
he had been able to acquire his TV channels at low cost.

<TEXT>
EUROPEAN finance ministers meeting in Oporto at the weekend pointed to the
difficulties inherent in having non-EC countries such as Sweden formally
linking their currencies to the exchange rate mechanism of the European
Monetary System.
Mr Norman Lamont, the British chancellor of the exchequer, said: 'We want to
extend the zone of monetary stability in the continent of Europe.' However,
this would require close study of the technical and practical implicat ions.
A Danish official said: 'It is not clear what joining the EMS would mean for
these countries.'
Mr Carlos Solchaga, the Spanish economy minister, insisted that any
agreement with third countries 'should not put at risk the motor role of the
EMS in preparing for monetary union'.
A report will be prepared for the next finance ministers' meeting in June.
Under the EMS, currencies which come under pressure benefit automatically
from multilateral action by the Community's central banks, while countries
outside the EMS have to make their own arrangements.
Sweden, which has applied to join the EC, wants to set bilateral parities
with EMS currencies such as the D-mark, effectively putting the krona into
the ERM.
Norway and Finland have unilaterally linked their currencies to the Ecu,
while Austria has unofficially pegged the schilling to the D-mark.
Central and eastern European countries may soon be seeking similar links.

FRANCE'S two main opposition leaders have agreed for the first time to hold
a primary poll to choose a single candidate to contest the next presidential
election.
Former president Mr Valery Giscard d'Estaing, head of the UDF centre-right
party, and Mr Jacques Chirac, former prime minister and head of the Gaullist
RPR, have asked senior party officials to agree on a primary voting system
before July 1, said Le Monde newspaper.
President Francois Mitterrand's second term expires in May 1995.
This brings to a climax repeated recent efforts by Mr Chirac and Mr Giscard
d'Estaing, fierce rivals, to smooth over some of the divisions between and
within their parties, highlighted by the opposition's disarray in last
week's parliamentary debate on the Maastricht Treaty on European Union.
Mr Chirac stood against Mr Giscard d'Estaing in the 1981 presidential poll,
a split which was said at the time to have been a factor in the Socialists'
surprise election success. Mr Chirac stood again, unsucessfully, at the next
presidential election in 1988.
The two party leaders agreed at a private meeting last week that votes in an
opposition primary should be cast by an electoral college of 60,000 senior
party members, made up of members of parliament and local councillors,
according to Le Monde.
Fair play would be umpired by a committee of respected personalities,
accepted by both sides.

FT  11 MAY 92 / Finance Ministers Meet In Oporto: EC agrees to co-ordinate
measures to boost growth - 'A considerable breakthrough in the psychology of
the Community'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPEAN COMMUNITY finance ministers, meeting in Oporto at the weekend,
decided to co-ordinate the introduction of a range of supply-side measures
to boost growth.
But they rejected any short cut to a revival, saying EC economies have to
earn interest rate reductions through continued efforts to reduce public
spending and restrain wages. Mr Norman Lamont, the UK chancellor, hailed the
outcome as 'a very considerable breakthrough in the psychology of the
Community'.
Mr Jorge Braga de Macedo, Portugal's finance minister, said: 'The main
result of this meeting is a confirmation by the 12 that it is essential to
proceed with the medium-term strategy agreed at Maastricht and to raise the
credibility of European economic union.'
It was a signal to the markets that Maastricht was here to stay, he said.
Markets should be liberalised further and there was a need for greater
efforts to control public spending, measures which it is hoped would help
gradually to bring down interest rates.
The European Commission is to report within a month on how the co-ordinated
measures - which Mr Lamont suggested might include privatisation - can be
introduced into member states' convergence programmes.
The member states would examine and judge this through the 'multilateral
surveillance' process designed to encourage compliance with the stringent
financial targets for Emu later this decade.
Apart from lower deficits and wage moderation, the main emphasis was on
promoting flexibility in the labour market; a fast completion of the single
market and the need to conclude the stalled Uruguay Round on world trade
liberalisation; reducing the fiscal burden on savings to boost investment;
and boosting public investment at the expense of current spending.
Expectations of a rather fizzier 'European growth initiative' had been
encouraged by France's request for a special debate on the effect on growth
and jobs of high interest rates dictated by the high borrowing requirement
for German unification.
Mr Michel Sapin, French finance minister, suggested that since Germany's
budget deficit was not structural, Bonn should ease off interest rates and
'let the market work,' but EC frustration with Bonn was muted at the
meeting.
Mr Pierre Beregovoy, the French prime minister, said on French TV yesterday
that France had 'awoken the attention' of other EC governments on the need
to stimulate economic growth in the Community. 'There is not enough growth
and too many unemployed. We must buckle down together,' he said. 'It is
important that each government does what it can, taking account of the
economic situation, to accelerate growth.'
He singled out Germany, which is under continuing pressure from its EC
partners to drop interest rates to stimulate economic activity. 'Germany has
its difficulties and it is France's duty to understand them. . . on the
other hand, Germany must understand the difficulties of its EC partners,'
said Mr Beregovoy.
In Oporto Mr Theo Waigel, German finance minister, predicted what Mr Sapin
called 'very important cuts' to the budget, so that Germany's public
spending would grow only half as fast as investment. Mr Waigel described
last week's public sector wage rises, averaging 5.2 per cent, as 'bearable'
for a reduced budget.
Ministers and central bankers at the informal meeting said there were
unlikely to be new interest rate drops soon after last week's half point
cuts in the UK, France and Ireland. Mr Erik Hoffmeyer, chairman of the EC
central bankers, warned that premature cuts could lead to big short-term
capital flows. 'If you look at 1991, all of us tried to get rates down at
one time or other, and some of us burnt our fingers.'
Mr Carlos Solchaga, the Spanish finance minister facing a general strike on
May 28 because of planned social security cuts aimed at meeting Emu budget
targets, warned against giving 'an unreal impression that growth will come
very soon or be very strong, because that is not the case.'
Mr Lamont used the labour market debate to strengthen the UK's attack on EC
plans to introduce an obligatory limit of 48 hours in the working week, a
directive all its partners are likely to vote through at June 24's council
of social affairs ministers, after two years of British filibustering. The
Dutch and Spanish ministers, unlike their employment minister colleagues,
agreed the measure worked against the grain of growth.

FT  11 MAY 92 / Survey of Business Air Travel (12): Concorde - a hard act to
follow / Prospects for supersonic travel
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THIRTY YEARS ago the British and French governments finally gave the
go-ahead for the world's first supersonic airliner, the Concorde project.
But it was January 1976 before Concorde's first commercial flight and
another 10 years shuttling backwards and forwards over the Atlantic before
British Airways was able to report that the aircraft was making a healthy
profit.
Despite all the initial optimism of the 1960s, when the project's cost was
put at Pounds 80m and Britain and France were hoping to sell more than 400
aircraft, only 16 were actually built and the overall cost eventually
reached Pounds 2bn.
Nevertheless, Concorde came into its own in the 1980s economic boom as
captains of industry and finance, pop stars and sport personalities climbed
aboard the 100-seater aircraft to cross the Atlantic in style and on time
rather than worry about the cost.
For them the premium New York return fare of Pounds 5,000 is justified by
the savings in travelling time offered by Concorde. With mid-morning
departures from London and Paris the busy senior executive has time to sort
out his desk before departure and still be in New York's JFK airport at
9.30am the same day (or 9am on the Air France flight) after a flight of just
3 1/2 hours.
Inevitably, the recession and the cost-cutting plans of the 1990s have
forced some companies to reconsider the expense of flying senior executives
by Concorde. But Concorde still attracts its regular fliers, of whom some
travel every week, and those individuals who are willing to pay the
supersonic premium to arrive fresh.
In addition, Concorde continues to attract a busy charter business. Mr W. D.
(Jack) Lowe, BA's director of flight crew for Concorde says the airline
remains 'very happy with our Concorde operation; it has a beautiful niche.'
In spite of Concorde's age, Mr Lowe says BA 'has every intention of keeping
it flying well into the next century'. Nevertheless, he acknowledges that it
will be necessary to replace Concorde one day. Since the benefits of
supersonic flight are 'enormous', he has no doubt that Concorde will be
superseded by a second generation supersonic aircraft.
'It took just over 60 years to get from the Wright Brothers to Concorde. It
is not a case of 'if', it's a case of 'when', and it's 'when' that will
decide what we end up with,' he says. His enthusiasm appears to be shared by
others, in particular by the informal seven-nation group of companies which
has quietly been examining the feasibility for a successor to Concorde -
dubbed rather unflatteringly, the High Speed Commercial Transport (HSCT).
For several years, Boeing and McDonnell Douglas of the US, Aerospatiale of
France, British Aerospace and Deutsche Aerospace (DASA) of Germany have been
studying the possibility of such an aircraft. More recently, they have been
joined by Italian, Russian and Japanese industry representatives in the
Supersonic Commercial Transport International Co-operation Study Group, or
more informally 'the supersonic club'.
The group has been concentrating on three main issues, the technological
requirements for a second generation supersonic airliner, environmental
considerations and finally the potential market for the new jet. Mr Bob
McKinlay, who heads BAe's Airbus programme, says that although there are
still technical and other unresolved issues, the group's preliminary
conclusion 'is that there don't seem to be any show stoppers'.
Like the airlines, the aerospace industry believes the only real questions
are when a new supersonic aircraft will be built, and who will be in the
final consortium. The study project is being pushed forward in stages, but
the consensus view is that, providing no insurmountable technological
hurdles are encountered, the go-ahead could be given soon after the end of
the decade and that the aircraft could be in service somewhere between 2005
and 2010.
Convincing others outside the industry, especially environmentalists and the
governments that will probably have to subscribe most of the Dollars
5bn-plus cost, is likely to be as difficult as agreeing on a design in which
the manufacturers can share. But time is running out if the option of
travelling at supersonic speed is to be continuously maintained.
By the turn of the century Concorde will have been in regular service for
nearly 25 years. That is normally about the maximum life-span for an
airliner, although Concorde's annual usage is much lower. Nevertheless, if
any HSCT is to enter service in the early part of the next century, much of
the preliminary research and development must be undertaken in the current
decade.
Perhaps the most critical factor in the final decision on whether to go
ahead with a 'son of Concorde' is the likely market for supersonic travel.
Concorde, with its payload of only 100 seats, has always been viewed as a
'top persons' airliner', with a premium fare which has limited its market.
But there is now a wider appreciation of the benefits of faster travel, as
more people fly longer non-stop distances. By 2000, it is believed that
long-distance traffic will have doubled in volume, stimulated by such
new-generation subsonic long-range airliners such as the Airbus A-340,
Boeing 747-400 and McDonnell Douglas MD-11.
There are differing views about the size of the potential market. Some
believe that demand in the first quarter of the next century could justify
up to as many as 1,000 new supersonic aircraft, worth some Dollars
200-300bn, collectively carrying up to as many as 600,000 passengers a day.
But European analysts, with the reality of Concorde behind them, tend to be
more cautious, assessing the market at no more than a few hundred or so
aircraft.
To be commercially viable, the next generation of supersonic airliners will
have to be much bigger than Concorde, fly slightly faster and have a
significantly longer range. Although he emphasises no formal decision to go
ahead has been taken, Mr McKinlay believes any new supersonic aircraft would
need to seat 250 to 300 people in several classes, fly at between Mach 2 and
Mach 2.25 and have a range in excess of 5,500 miles compared to Concorde's
3,500 miles.
The range is critical because it would open up new high density routes such
as the trans-Pacific routes from America's west coast to Asia, for instance
Los Angeles to Tokyo. But to achieve ranges of that order, the new aircraft
will need to utilise high technology, low weight materials and a specialised
power plant - probably a form of variable cycle engine which would help it
meet some of the environmental noise objections while flying at subsonic
speeds.
Such an aircraft could cut many long distance journey times in half and help
attract new travellers to supersonic flight. Nevertheless fares, although
perhaps not as high as Concorde, will probably still reflect a technology
premium for supersonic travel.
The HSCT will be expensive to build and is likely to face even more severe
environmental demands than Concorde in terms of noise levels and pollution.
Meeting those demands will be difficult technologically and financially -
far beyond the capabilities of any one company. There is no doubt that the
HSCT, whenever it is built, will have to be a consortium venture.

FT  11 MAY 92 / Survey of Business Air Travel (10): The office in the sky -
Airborne services are expanding
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
FOR MANY business travellers the cabin of a long-haul aircraft is a haven
from the clattering machinery and constant telephone calls of their offices.
There is fine wine and fine cuisine to enjoy; and on most flights there are
six hours or so of comfortable travel 30,000ft above the daily grind.
But all this is about to change. Aware that flying time is working time for
executives, the world's leading airlines are putting office equipment in the
sky.
Travellers who in the past had only to concern themselves about whether the
steak would be rare or the Pouilly-Fuisse chilled, now worry about making
long-distance calls and sending faxes from up in the stratosphere.
What, for some, was the ultimate bus to work has now become an extension of
the office. New technology has enabled carriers to offer faxes and - at
one's seat - on-screen share price information and mobile phones for
direct-dialling to any number on the globe.
Leading the pack among office-minded airlines is probably MGM Grand Air, a
subsidiary of the entertainment group. The US carrier's fleet of refurbished
DC-8 aircraft boasts a computer and telephone at each leather-bound seat. An
all-executive configuration has created space for conference rooms, sleeping
quarters and even marble bathrooms.
MGM Grand Air, however, is not regarded as serious competition by larger
rivals such as American Airlines and United. It is essentially a one-route
operation: Los Angeles to New York, although it has applied to fly to
London.
Among the so-called mega-carriers, Japan Air Lines is one of the leading
innovators in changing the image of business class travel from 'room to be
bored' to boardroom.
In addition to its traditional in-flight mail-service and more recent
introduction of personal video screens, JAL has been the first airline to
experiment with satellite communications to offer telephone and fax
services. Later this year the carrier will be one of the first to introduce
CD players on flights.
But as in other areas of technology, where Japan leads, the US soon follows.
American companies such as GTE Airfone and Hughes Avicom are developing new
systems to beam business information into aircraft cabins.
GTE Airfone, which has just won an order to install equipment on 78 aircraft
operated by Continental Airlines, has launched Genstar. This is a new
information service using digital technology to broadcast stock market news
via ground stations and satellites to business travellers.
It can also transmit faxes, computer data and other information. GTE claims
it will even allow travellers to contact people on other flights.
If the idea of a mid-flight call from your boss puts you off your canapes,
then you might opt for an airline using the alternative Hughes Avicom
system. The California-based avionics company has developed technology
feeding information to mini-computers mounted in seat armrests.
Hughes' computers work on a touch-screen basis to offer live television
events and continually updated share prices.
American Airlines has Hughes Avicom technology on 60 aircraft, as has
Emirates, the UAE carrier which is spending Dollars 1.4m on personal videos
in each aircraft.
Emirates expects to install telephones next year and Mr Mike Simon, the
airlines external relations general manager, says faxes will follow soon
after.
All this gadgetry, from faxes to phone calls, does not come cheap. MGM's
luxuriously appointed fleet cost Dollars 55.5m or Dollars 162,500 for each
seat equipped with the desktop basics: telephone and computer.
There is no cheap rate period for air to ground telephone calls. JAL's
system, which relays calls to Kokusai Denshin Denwas - the equivalent of BT
 -via the Inmarsat pacific satellite, costs about Pounds 6 a minute.
Travellers pay for their calls with credit cards inserted in a groove in the
telephone handset. Once payment is cleared, the Japanese operator on the
ground connects the airborne caller to the normal international telephone
network.
Northwest Airlines, meanwhile, is spending Dollars 70m on Hughes-Avicom
equipment for their first and business class cabins as part of a Dollars
450m upgrade.
The system, called Worldlink, is to be installed in the back of each economy
seat and in the armrests of forward section seats. Mr Richard Bertagna,
president of Hughes-Avicom, says: 'We hope to provide Northwest with
on-board telephones, aircraft satellite antennas and direct satellite
links.'
Few European carriers are matching the schemes planned by their US and
Japanese rivals. Moves to install passenger telephones have been hampered
because there are no pan-European air-to-ground links or Terrestrial Telecom
Systems, as they are known in the US. The high cost of satellite
communications, meanwhile, has dissuaded carriers such as British Airways
from adopting JAL's system.
BA is experimenting with new technology but a decision on large-scale
investment will not be taken until a system exists which can be used
throughout its route network. Mr Ken Codrington, the airline's project
manager on cabin avionics, says BA is working closely with telecom companies
to develop an airborne public telephone system.
The proposed European system will offer voice links initially and data
services at a later date. BA is, however, installing new video screens in
its business and first-class cabins which can be upgraded to use interactive
technology.
Business travellers can, therefore, expect an increasing array of office
equipment at their fingertips before the end of the century. From take-off
to landing, executives will no longer be out of touch and flying-time could
soon become part of the ordinary working day.
'It's the next generation of in-flight service,' says Mr Simon at Emirates.
'Airlines will do whatever is necessary to keep businessmen in contact with
their office.'

FT  11 MAY 92 / Survey of Business Air Travel (11): Bush pledge on fiscal
relief is welcomed by jet industry - Corporate and executive aircraft
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT IS, perhaps, self-evident that a corporate jet market does not flourish
in recessionary times. Throw in a few complicating factors - such as tax
disincentives or a forbidding product liability climate in the US - and life
for general aviation manufacturers becomes tough, indeed.
That is roughly what has occurred over the past few years. According to the
Washington-based General Aviation Manufacturers' Association - which
represents 32 US manufacturers of general aviation aircraft, engines and
related equipment - the industry shipped a total of 1,021 aircraft in 1991.
That was the lowest annual number since World War Two, and it took new
aircraft revenues below the Dollars 2bn mark - to Dollars 1.97bn.
Within this depressing overall picture, the turbojet segment was actually
the most heartening. A total of 186 turbojet aircraft was shipped last year
 -a 10.7 per cent increase on 1990's 168 - while the number of turboprops
fell by 21 per cent and piston-powered aircraft were down by 11.8 per cent.
But all things are relative; in the peak year, 1981, 389 jets were delivered
by US manufacturers.
There is a clear reason for this fall-off in deliveries. Jets often
represent discretionary expenditure. When corporate belts are being
tightened, such outlays - which, in the case of a corporate jet can range
between Dollars 2.5m and Dollars 25m - are among the first to be pruned.
Questions of image may also be involved. In the words of one analyst
recently: 'When you're laying off hundreds of workers, buying a corporate
jet does not look good.'
In the US, the luxury tax on the sales of new general aviation aircraft,
which was imposed by Congress in 1990, has also been blamed for putting an
additional dampener on demand. The tax has been levied on that portion of a
new aircraft's price that exceeds Dollars 250,000, but is waived if the
aircraft is flown 80 per cent or more for business purposes. General
aviation manufacturers have complained of lost sales as a direct result -
for jets, turboprops and piston-powered aircraft. For example, Beech, owned
by Raytheon, has been quoted as saying that the tax had stymied over 50
aircraft sales by the end of 1991.
It was, therefore, with some relief that the industry heard President Bush's
'State of the Union' address earlier this year, in which he promised some
fiscal relief. Just for good measure, there was also a call for tort reform
which has devastated light aircraft production. The GAMA termed it 'a
positive step in the right direction, although it still demanded that a more
powerful 'growth package' be enacted.
Given these problems, it is perhaps surprising that jet business has held up
as well as it has. Most manufacturers gratefully acknowledge that demand
from 'foreign' countries - such as the Middle East, Latin America and
selective European nations - has been the mainstay.
Cessna, for example, which has now pulled out of the piston aircraft market
and relies entirely on the jet and turboprop markets - reckons that non-US
sales for its Citation jets are currently running at over 50 per cent of the
total. This compares with around 14 per cent in 1984. Another US jet
manufacturer lists Mexico and Venezuela as leading markets in Latin America,
while Italy and Germany are still reckoned to be strong European customers.
Dassault Aviation, the French manufacturer, has also stated that foreign
sales are critical to growth and market share.
Certainly, there has been a fair amount of activity in terms of new products
and design work. The smaller, lower-priced jet market is one example. Here,
some forecasts have suggested that up to 2,000 jets could be sold over the
next 15 years, as the 'small' jets compete on price with turboprops, and
attempt to eat into the latter market.
Cessna's six-seat Citation jet, which started out with a Dollars 2.5m price
tag but which has crept up since, is scheduled to be delivered late this
year. Industry observers expect a fierce marketing battle with its Wichita
neighbour, Beech Aircraft, which - besides making the larger and more
expensive Beechjet - produces turboprops in the Citation jet price range.
'The continued development of new business jets bodes well for the future,'
noted Mr Edward Stimpson, GAMA's president, recently. 'US manufacturers have
continued to invest heavily in R&amp;D in the midst of a prolonged recession.
Several new jets have been announced and others are nearing certification.'
The industry has, of course, seen a sprinkling of ownership changes. Cessna
was sold to Textron, the aerospace and financial services conglomerate, for
Dollars 600m earlier this year. Raytheon and Dassault are believed to have
been among the handful of final bidders. And now British Aerospace, the UK
group, plans to divest its corporate jet subsidiary.

FT  11 MAY 92 / Survey of Business Air Travel (9): Those bottlenecks seem
likely to continue - Air traffic control
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BUSINESS traveller hardly needs reminding about the inadequacies of the
European Air Traffic Control (ATC) system - the delays are all too real and
there is little prospect of real improvement in the next two to three years.
Last year in Europe more than 20,000 flights a month in the summer and
10,000 a month in the winter were delayed because of ATC problems. The
proportion of flights more than 15 minutes late almost doubled between 1987
and 1991.
The Association of European Airlines, representing 22 European carriers,
says almost 20 per cent of flights were delayed by more than 15 minutes last
year, only slightly better than in 1990 even though 1991 saw a 7 per cent
decline in air travel caused by the Gulf War. Last year, 54,000 aircraft
hours were lost because of congestion, equivalent to the annual workload of
a fleet of 20 short-haul jets.
A comparison of times on short-haul routes within Europe shows that flights
are now scheduled to take between 5 and 10 per cent longer today than they
did 20 years ago, despite improvements in technology. For example, in 1972 a
British Airways flight between London Heathrow to Paris Orly took one hour.
Today the same flight is scheduled to take five minutes longer - to allow
for delays.
Unprecedented air traffic growth in the 1980s, coupled with a shortage of
air traffic controllers and ageing equipment, has resulted in congestion on
the ground and in the skies, and pushed Europe's fragmented ATC system to
breaking point, particularly during peak summer periods.
With air traffic still growing at about 8 per cent a year, the volume
doubles every 10 years. As a result, airlines and civil aviation authorities
have warned that Europe faces an air travel crisis in the next few years
unless urgent action is taken to harmonise and integrate European ATC
systems. According to Mr Karel Van Miert, EC transport commissioner, air
traffic delays in Europe already cost Pounds 3.8bn a year and airlines have
warned that these threaten to undermine Brussels's efforts to liberalise
European air transport.
The problems were highlighted in a report considered by transport ministers
from the 28 member countries of the European Civil Aviation Conference
(ECAC) who gathered in London in March. The report said the work needed to
harmonise and improve air traffic control in Europe in the 1990s 'will be
much greater' and more costly than first estimated.
The study, undertaken by Eurocontrol, the Brussels-based government-backed
air safety group, examined the ATC systems of the 23 nations which were
members of the conference in April 1990 when the European Air Traffic
Control Harmonisation and Integration Programme (Eatchip) action plan was
agreed (since then five eastern European nations have joined ECAC.) In
Europe some 50 ATC centres spread over an area of 3m square miles - roughly
comparable in size with the US which operates a single ATC system from 20
centres - handled 4.8m flights in 1990, of which 90 per cent were internal
European traffic.
In contrast to the US, the European ATC centres 'share one big (technical)
deficiency, namely their generalised incompatibility,' said the report.
Eurocontrol discovered 31 different systems in the European ATC centres,
using computers from 18 manufacturers, with 22 different operating systems
and 33 different programming languages.
The result, said the report is 'a patchwork of systems, most of which have
been developed independently, using different designs and methodologies
leading to further incompatibilities.' In addition, of the centres
evaluated, Eurocontrol said half had 'significant deficiencies' and almost
one in four had 'major deficiencies', while only 17 per cent had no
problems.
Until fairly recently, attempts to get to grips with Europe's ATC problems
had been stalled because of political and other disagreements. As Air Vice
Marshal Mike Gibson, director-general of policy and plans at the National
Air Traffic Services of the UK's Civil Aviation Authority, says, it has been
difficult because 'there wasn't one particular organisation with the right
membership and the right expertise'.
The European Commission, backed by Germany in particular, had argued for the
building of a single new integrated system. However this approach was
resisted by others, including the UK, which argued that it was too
expensive, bureaucratic and unworkable, raising a number of difficult
sovereignty issues.
But recently most attention has focused on the ECAC and on the initiative to
upgrade the existing ATC systems in Europe and get them to work together.
'What we are trying to do is to get the worst in Europe up to the standard
of the best and then to get all of the systems in Europe working together so
that, from a user's point of view, there is a seamless system,' explains Mr
Gibson.
The basis of the plan therefore is a 'programme of convergence,' overseen by
Eurocontrol, to harmonise procedures across Europe and improve and upgrade
the existing ATC systems with equipment complying to common standards which
can then be integrated. The plan embodies a step-by-step approach to
integration, setting a series of operational targets such as those for radar
coverage and communications. The strategy aims progressively to integrate
ATC systems after they are harmonised in the busiest 'core area' - roughly
bounded by London, Frankfurt and Paris - by 1995 at the latest and elsewhere
by 1998.
In March the ECAC transport ministers agreed to extend the plan to harmonise
and integrate the operations of ATC systems to the five new Eastern European
Conference members, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Poland and Romania.
Since the capacity of the air traffic system depends not only on the
en-route air traffic control system but also the operational airport
infrastructure, ECAC transport ministers also acknowledged the importance of
relieving congestion in and around airports by launching a new airport
strategy.
Overall, members of the ECAC plan to spend more than Ecu 3bn on air traffic
equipment over the next four years. The UK itself plans Pounds 750m of
expenditure on the air traffic system by the end of the century, including
the building of a new air traffic control centre on the south coast, due to
be operational by 1996.
At the same time, some progress towards integration of ATC systems has been
made in parts of Europe and Eurocontrol has begun the task of creating a
single central flow management unit in 1994 co-ordinating airline flight
planning throughout Europe and replacing the current five flow management
units.
In the longer term the ECAC strategy has been designed to accommodate the
introduction of new advanced technology systems such as air/ground data
links and satellite tracking and navigation systems including the
International Civil Aviation Organisation plans for Future Air Navigation
Systems (Fans).
Satellites, in conjunction with VHF radio, precision landing systems and
aircraft transponders which report altitude and other data are likely to
revolutionise air traffic control worldwide. For example, developing
countries could use satellites instead of expensive ground-based radar
systems to build an ATC system at a relatively small cost.
The US, which boasts the world's most sophisticated ATC system, will
nevertheless also probably begin replacing some of its ground-based
navigation systems over the next decade. Spurred by mid-air collisions and
increasingly frequent near-misses, the US authorities are already forcing
airlines to install traffic-alert and collision-avoidance systems (TCAS) by
1994.
After serious concern was voiced about emerging signs of infrastructure
deficiencies in the mid 1980s, the US moved quickly to upgrade its ATC
system. The number of air traffic controllers was increased, the Federal
Aviation Authority was given a bigger budget, and the introduction of a
Dollars 2.5bn nationwide air ATC system was accelerated together with a
Dollars 16bn programme to cope with aircraft movements projected for the
next decade.
Even so, there are forecasts that air traffic bottlenecks will continue
through the 1990s and that many US airports will shortly reach runway and
terminal saturation point. As in south-east Asia, there are substantial
plans for new airports and airport expansions - plans that will be closely
monitored in Europe.

the limit - Asia-Pacific

THE Asia-Pacific air travel market offers the world's most promising growth
prospects for the 1990s, with passenger demand forecast to increase at
nearly double-digit rates annually into the next century.
As industry deregulation edges along, a fierce dogfight is already shaping
up, particularly for lucrative first and business class travellers. Not
surprisingly, regional carriers are focusing the same high-quality,
low-overhead strategies on air travel that have made Asia-Pacific
competitors so formidable in many other industries.
'This region has the best growth potential in the world based on its
economic prospects,' says Mr Philip Mok, head of research at Barclays de
Zoete Wedd Securities in Hong Kong. Demand for air travel will increase
about 8 per cent annually over the next few years, he predicts.
South-east Asian carriers are particularly well positioned to expand
rapidly, backed by surging economies and reputations for some of the world's
best inflight service. Among the leaders are Hong Kong's Cathay Pacific,
Thai Airways International and Singapore Airlines (SIA) - already one of the
island state's leading enterprises.
Flag carriers from other industrialising nations, including Malaysia
Airlines and Garuda Indonesia, are also keen to capitalise on growing
business and tourist travel.
To the north, Korean Air has carved out an impressive niche, flying between
the homeland, North America and neighbouring Japan.
Industry observers see the region's economic superpower as the fulcrum for
Asia-Pacific business air travel, because of the size and growth potential
of Japan's market and its geographical suitability to act as a hub for
onward travel from south-east Asia to Europe and North America.
Unfortunately, Japanese business travellers have been slow to return since
the Gulf War knocked them from the skies, partly because of the current
economic slowdown at home.
'We've noticed quite a few Japanese companies since the Gulf War have
suffered financially and downgraded executives formerly entitled to a higher
class of travel,' says Mr Shiro Shibuya, SIA's manager of industry affairs
and public relations in Tokyo. 'Still, we hope business on Japanese routes
will grow faster than elsewhere.'
The near-term prospects are not bright, says Mr Takeharu Iwata,
vice-president of Japan Airlines (JAL), the world's seventh largest carrier
in 1990. 'We cannot expect a big improvement to 1989 levels for at least
another year or year and a half,' he says.
Far from threatening to dominate Asia-Pacific skies, as they have many other
regional markets, Japanese rivals will do well just to hang onto their
already dwindling market share, industry observers say.
'The way the Japanese achieved their position in many industries was to get
in with low prices, aim for market share and slowly build up. But airlines
operate on bilateral agreements, so you can't get market share without
offering the other party monetary rewards or a similar share,' says Mr Mok.
'There is very little room left' to win away customers with service superior
to that of foreign rivals, concedes JAL's Mr Iwata.
Incursions into their home airspace by low-overhead carriers are already
costing Japanese airlines dearly. Foreign airlines increased their share of
international passenger traffic to and from Japan by 1.9 percentage points
to 65.1 per cent in the two years through 1990 alone as the annual number of
travellers on these routes topped 30m.
Japanese airlines must vie with expenses roughly double those for south-east
Asian rivals, says JAL's Mr Iwata. 'The Ministry of Transportation must to
some extent protect Japanese carriers, but it is also forcing us to compete
following the tendency of the US,' he says. 'We do not have a pricing or
merchandising advantage, but I think we can maintain the business travel
share we now have by introducing new aspects of services and flight
schedules.'
In early April, JAL launched a major advertising campaign to woo back
Japanese business travellers with menu and other changes, but rapidly
internationalising domestic rival All Nippon Airlines and especially foreign
carriers are likely to continue gaining on the flag carrier.
'Business travel is the cream of airline operations. Our philosophy is to
satisfy passengers to gain repeat business, not just offer cheap fares,'
says SIA's Mr Shibuya. 'We don't mind using expensive champagne and other
things if that's what it takes.'
Such strategies combined with lower overhead ultimately could force Japanese
airlines to hand over intra-Asian routes to subsidiaries which can take
advantage of less costly foreign labour.
Meanwhile, Asia-Pacific airlines are setting their sights on newly emerging
routes within the region plus destinations much further afield. Close to
home, the last several months have witnessed a rush of new services between
second-tier Japanese cities such as Fukuoka and Hiroshima and international
destinations, in part because no new slots are available at Tokyo and Osaka
area terminals.
Routes to Indochina also are increasing in number as political conditions
improve and a rapidly rising flood of investors and tourists makes its way
to Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia. Demand for service to the Chinese mainland
likewise is quickly expanding.
South-east Asian airlines should fare well in competition to and from Europe
and North America, argues Mr Mok. 'They have strong cash flows and money to
buy new aircraft. Most are also efficiently run. I tend to be bullish on
airlines in the region,' he says.
The major bottleneck at present and future key to Asia-Pacific travel is
Japan's acute shortage of airport capacity, which is already forcing
airlines to shelve expansion plans.
The New Kansai International Airport off the coast of Osaka will be the
nation's first 24-hour facility when it opens in mid-1994, about 15 months
behind schedule. A survey earlier this year reflected just how far available
terminal space lags demand in reporting that carriers now seek twice the
facilities planned in Osaka to accommodate 160,000 arrivals and departures
annually.
Along with major expansion projects at the Narita and Haneda terminals
serving Tokyo, Japanese air traffic capacity should roughly double by 1995.
The expanded capacity will add severe price competition to the already
troubled Japanese carriers' list of woes, enabling new rivals to enter the
market and established foreign airlines to increase service.
US carriers have already carved out large markets to Japan and beyond with
the help of giant feeder systems back home and politically sensitive
international agreements that provide them abundant terminal access.
However, even with Japan's new terminals in service, capacity shortages will
dampen traffic growth for years.
That could be good news for airport projects elsewhere in the region,
including South Korea, Hong Kong, Taiwan and Singapore, which are seeking
some of the hub-terminal activity that has benefited many North American
cities.

FT  11 MAY 92 / Survey of Business Air Travel (7): Giants, niche players and
others - Liberalisation in Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ON JANUARY 1 1993, the European Community moves another step towards
deregulating the skies over its 350m citizens. Although the details will not
be finalised until mid-summer, in theory, airlines from one country will be
able to sell tickets for flights between two other countries and perhaps
even within other countries.
Airlines with captive home markets such as Lufthansa in Germany and Air
France face the prospect of competing on the Paris-Berlin route with the
likes of British Airways or KLM.
The result of such competition should be cheaper fares. When the US
deregulated its skies in 1976, rival airlines threw themselves into a
sometimes deadly war. Low fares eventually brought low some of the great
names of US aviation history.
PanAm, Braniff, Eastern and People Express disappeared. TWA, Continental and
others are in deep trouble, protected from their creditors by Chapter 11
bankruptcy rules.
In spite of such failures, supporters of deregulation point to busy routes
such as Los Angeles-San Francisco where fares are low and still profitable
much of the time. Successful airlines argue that the years of competition
have simply eliminated the inefficient.
However, many in the industry believe that Europe is not like the US. They
say deregulation will lose its airlines a lot of money and that fares will
not fall far. The Association of European Airlines, which represents 22
national carriers, says that this is because the cost structure is different
in Europe.
Air traffic control charges are higher to reflect the crowded skies and
complexities of international travel.
Landing charges are higher, reflecting demand for use of the most important
airports. American Airlines briefly flew transatlantic flights on from
Brussels to Zurich. 'It was expensive. We were paying double the landing
costs on a short-haul flight' says the airline.
Salaries, which account for one third of costs, are higher. This has been
damaging already in some countries. Swissair, for example, is moving its
accounts department to Bombay, India, this autumn to cut costs.
Such obstacles have not dissuaded US airlines from piling into Europe ahead
of 1993. American now flies from a dozen European cities while Delta has a
hub at Frankfurt with feeder flights coming in from many European cities.
European airlines are struggling to anticipate the changes. They have tried
to organise mergers or alliances with varying success. Most spectacularly,
British Airways failed to merge with KLM of Holland earlier this year after
months of negotiation.
In contrast, Air France finally succeeded this month in taking a stake in
Sabena, the Belgian carrier. The deal had been delayed for many months and
followed an aborted attempt to forge an alliance between Sabena, BA and KLM.
The logic is that a deregulated Europe will, like the US, allow only two
types of airline to prosper: the giant, whose economies of scale give it
greater financial strength, and the niche player, which concentrates on
taking a slice of revenue from busy routes.
Europe is full of airlines that do not fit into either category. One,
Scandinavian Airline System (SAS), has been among the most energetic in
trying to find partners. It is in the European Quality Alliance (EQA) -
which allows for the co-ordination of timetables and sharing of some airport
facilities - with Swissair and Austrian Airlines.
Last month it boosted its stake in Airlines of Britain, the parent company
of British Midland, from 24.9 per cent to 40 per cent. In February, it
agreed to buy 51 per cent control of Linjeflyg, the Swedish domestic
carrier.
The acquisition is designed to consolidate the airline's position in its
home market in anticipation of Swedish airline deregulation.
'By combining SAS with British Midland and EQA, we will have an annual
passenger volume of 35.2m passengers,' says Mr Jan Carlzon, the chief
executive of SAS. This, he says, makes his partnership the largest in
Europe, ahead of Air France with 33.4m passengers a year.
Few deny that such alliances will improve the chances that airlines become
more efficient. And if European deregulation follows the US example, then
there will be heavy competition among efficient airlines on busy routes
between financial and industrial centres. Business travellers will be among
the first to benefit.
But with Europe's high cost base, airlines' flexibility to cut fares is
limited. Such cuts that are likely could be slow in coming as some European
governments resist rapid liberalisation.
Before the end of the century - possibly in less than a year - business
travellers will have a greater choice of airlines on which to fly. But those
looking forward to sharp falls in fares will probably be disappointed.

FT  11 MAY 92 / Survey of Business Air Travel (6): Bigger means better - and
it saves money - Wide-bodied jets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LIKE HEAVYWEIGHT boxers, the biggest aircraft combine glamour and
popularity. They embody mass marketing of cheap air travel and yet are the
flagships for the world's airlines.
Even during the world economic slowdown of the last 18 months, manufacturers
have been pouring cash into the development of new wide-bodied aircraft. The
reason is that bigger aircraft mean cheaper travel. With cheaper travel,
there can be more passengers and in turn more aircraft sales.
How are wide-bodied aircraft different from other aircraft? 'Luxury,'
according to Mr Paul Griffiths, commercial director of Virgin Atlantic. On a
wide-bodied aircraft there is room for bars, lounges and the sheer space
that business passengers demand on long-haul journeys.
Mr Rod Muddle, head of planning at British Airways, has a different point to
make. 'Our overriding motive is to provide growth at competitive unit
costs,' he says. 'This is only achievable with wide-bodied jets.'
Big aircraft save airlines money in several ways. At many overcrowded
airports including London's Heathrow, Tokyo's Narita and New York's JFK,
landing rights are rationed. Each airline has a specific number of landing
and take-off slots available to it. Airlines jealously guard their landing
rights knowing they will probably not be given any more. It is possible
nevertheless for airlines to plan for growth by using bigger aircraft.
Large aircraft use less fuel per passenger than small aircraft. Fuel
accounts for more than 10 per cent of total costs at many airlines. So
airlines' order books stretch into the second half of the decade. With
manufacturers spending so much on development, big aircraft are made with
the latest materials, economical engines and computerised controls. It is a
combination that still further improves fuel economy.
This vast market is the battleground for just three manufacturers.
Boeing of the US is the biggest by far. The 747 has dominated sales for so
long that it is hard to imagine it being replaced. Boeing's next new product
is the 777. It will slip in below the 747 in the product range and is due to
enter service in 1995. The initial model will accommodate 328 passengers,
compared with the 419 on board the largest 747s, and has a shorter range
too. 'The interior is similar in dimensions with the 747, it's just a
smaller aircraft,' says BA's Mr Muddle. He says that the 777 will on some
routes replace the 767, a smaller wide-bodied aircraft.
Airbus, owned by a consortium of European companies, is in No 2 position. It
is due to deliver the first of its new A340 aircraft to Lufthansa early next
year. It is Airbus' first four-engined aircraft and represents a new market
for the company. The A340's selling point is its range, at 7,550 miles,
greater than any other commercial aircraft. It carries 262 passengers.
US-based McDonnell-Douglas is close behind Airbus. Many of its hopes are
pinned on its latest product, the MD-11, recognisable by the turned-up wing
tips. Sales began last year.
The MD-11 faces a tough battle against head-on competition from the Airbus
A-340 and the Boeing 777. 'We believe the MD-11 will be the loser,' says Mr
George Shapiro, aerospace analyst at Salomon Brothers in New York. He blames
the older technology which gives that aircraft a shorter range than the
Airbus A340 and a smaller passenger carrying capacity than the Boeing 777.
Mr Shapiro is also concerned that sales might be difficult given the
political controversy surrounding McDonnell-Douglas' plans to sell a 40 per
cent stake in its commercial aircraft operations to Taiwanese companies.
The aircraft maker nevertheless last month announced that it intended to
develop with the Taiwanese a radical new design to be called the MD-12. This
would be a megajumbo jet designed to challenge the successors to Boeing's
747. It would be a double-decked aircraft carrying more than 500 passengers
and flying more than 8,000 miles non-stop. Target launch date is 1997.
Such double-deckers have been the subject of much industry talk in recent
weeks. At the biannual Asian air show in Singapore in February, British
Airways revealed plans for a series of fuselage configurations that would
carry up to 800 passengers on a single aircraft. A string of potential
designs was floated including figure-of-eight shaped fuselages, both
horizontal and vertical.
The ideas are exciting, but the operators of airports are worried they will
not be able to cope. 'Wingspan is the biggest issue,' says Mr Richard
Everett, director, legal services, of BAA, which operates most of the UK's
large airports. The Boeing 747 has a wingspan of 65 metres but BAA is
drawing up contingency plans to accommodate 85 metre wingspan aircraft.
Mr Everett warns that much of the talk of ultra-high capacity aircraft might
come to nothing. 'There is a strong feeling in the industry that a bigger
747 is more likely to arise,' he says. He forecasts that the upper deck of
the Boeing 747 will be extended along the length of the fuselage. Already
the 747-300 and 400 have an upper deck more than seven metres longer than on
previous 747s.
Dealing with bigger wings is one of several problems. It is already a
tedious process to put 400 passengers on an aircraft. If numbers were
doubled, BAA says it would move to two-door boarding, entailing a redesign
of terminals. BAA has no plans to do this 'until the larger aircraft are
already on their way'.
Megajumbos will happen, insists BA. 'It is a total rethink,' says Mr Muddle.
The 747 was designed 30 years ago and there are new customers now with
different requirements. The strongest source of demand comes from the
Pacific rim, he says.
As if to echo this sentiment, McDonell-Douglas is already talking of the
non-stop flights that will be possible with the MD-12: Dallas to Seoul,
Zurich to Singapore and others.
Mr Muddle has detailed a 10-strong team at BA to list what parameters a
turn-of-the-century world champion megajumbo should follow. Their blueprints
could presage the next age of air travel in which passengers paid less for
seats and yet were able to fly non-stop between just about any two cities on
the globe.

The US

AIR TRAVEL in the US for the business executive has undergone a radical
shake-up in recent weeks.
The overhaul started in mid-April, when American Airlines, one of the
nation's largest carriers, announced that it was restructuring all its
domestic fares. Out went the morass of discount offers, including corporate
discounts, leaving the company to promote four basic fare classes. These
comprise first class, full coach, seven-day advance purchase, and 21-day
advance purchase. (This last class was subsequently changed to 14-day
advance purchase, as competitors piled in). American explained that it would
switch to a mileage-based system and claimed that, as a general rule, the
new fares would be cheaper than those previously pertaining in these
particular classes. For instance, it pledged that first class fares would be
20-50 per cent below previous levels. Full coach fares (now called AAnytime
fares) would be 38 per cent lower In truth, matters were never quite that
simple. Mr Bob Crandall, American's chairman, was quick to point out that
the carrier's business class fares on the New York-Los Angeles route would
not be affected, for example. Nevertheless, the carrier estimated that its
new structure would mean that the total number of different fares offered
would shrink dramatically, from over 500,000 to nearer 70,000. American's
move has been variously interpreted. Some commentators have suggested that
it was a response to the persistent threat posed by smaller competitors. On
the one hand, Mr Carl Icahn's bankrupt Trans World Airlines has been
undercutting virtually all other carriers in the domestic market, in a
desperate effort to win customers. This has cost the airline dearly - it has
produced operating losses of Dollars 34m and Dollars 49m in January and
February respectively - but there is no doubt that travellers prepared to
take a chance on TWA's continued existence have generally flown via the
carrier at extremely cheap rates.
On the other hand, Southwest Airlines - based, like American, in Texas  -
has been running very attractively-priced services on high-density business
routes. (Indeed, in the furore which followed American's move, Southwest
probably scored the best publicity coup by saying: 'We'd like to match
American, but that would mean we'd have to raise our prices.'
Mr Crandall, however, had other explanations for his carrier's initiative.
He claimed that the move would be justified by the subsequent cost-savings,
the medium-term increase in business which should develop, and by
travellers' switch to 'higher-quality' tickets. For example, a businessman
might now buy a cheaper full fare ticket, instead of searching for complex
discount fare arrangements (which often involved throwing part of a ticket
away, or swinging Saturday night stay-overs).
Some commentators agree with the airline chief's analysis. 'American is
willing to take diminished yields in the short term to reduce the costs of
maintaining a structure with half a million separate fares,' commented
Avmark, the aviation consultancy. 'It is an attempt to break the
recession-induced stagnation in air travel growth and put more people in the
airline's seats  .. It makes economic sense only if your pockets are deep
enough to stand those reduced yields for a time.'
The immediate response from rivals - for the most part - has been to match
American's move. United, Delta, Continental, Northwest and USAir, for
example, all pledged immediately to remain 'competitive'. And they did their
best to battle back against American's aggressive advertising campaign:
United, for instance, quickly countered American's AAnytime fares, with its
own new 'Fair Fares'. TWA, meanwhile, said it would continue to undercut
substantially on certain routes.
At the end of the day, this radical pricing overhaul has probably brought
gains and losses for the business traveller. A year ago, when the Gulf War
drove away air traffic and bankruptcies were rife in the industry, special
discount fares meant that air travel was extremely cheap. That benefited
both the general public and many business travellers, except those booking
at the last minute.
With the level of discounts diminishing somewhat since then, the current
initiative means that business executives can now take a straightforward,
unrestricted coach fare more cheaply.
That is the upside. The downside are the decisions by American - and some
others - to phase out corporate discounts and introduce a Dollars 25 fee for
each reticketing requirement. And for those business travellers who are able
to book ahead, the array of discount fares has certainly subsided - even if
the continued presence of financially-troubled carriers in the industry
means that they have not disappeared altogether.

FT  11 MAY 92 / Survey of Business Air Travel (4): Demand holds up but
prices are keen - UK internal flights
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID CHURCHILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DOMESTIC business air travel, often regarded as the Cinderella of the
airline world, has survived - if not exactly prospered - during the
recession better than might have been expected a year ago. While
international air travel has been slower to recover from the impact of war
and the world slowdown in economic growth, flights within the UK have held
up well.
Figures from the British Airports Authority (BAA), for example, show that
flights out of Heathrow to Glasgow last year were only 5.5 per cent down on
the previous year. To Edinburgh, the shortfall was even less at 4 per cent.
Mr Colin Rainbow, commercial director of Wagon Lits Business Travel
(formerly Pickfords), reports that demand from corporate business travel
clients for UK internal flights remains surprisingly buoyant. 'It's a market
where executives feel that it's more advantageous in some circumstances to
fly than drive or go by rail,' he says. 'Of course, some pretty fierce price
competition has helped as well.'
Most of the keen prices on domestic air travel, however, are aimed at
leisure travellers who have to book in advance and have little flexibility
in changing their tickets. Business travellers on UK routes, as in the
international market, pay significantly more for the privilege of being able
to pick and choose when they actually want - or need to - fly.
But the UK business air travel market is primarily about convenience.
Executives not only want frequent services to main cities such as Glasgow,
Edinburgh or Dublin, but also connections to smaller regional airports such
as Bristol or Norwich.
While the big airlines such as British Airways and British Midland, with
their sights set on Europe (or in BA's case the world), have had an
ambivalent attitude towards these regional routes, niche airlines have
stepped in to meet the demands of a growing internal market for business air
travel.
Brymon Airways, for example, is expanding its operations at its Bristol hub
and thismonth is basing a fourth Dash-8 aircraft at Bristol to boost its
services on its Bristol-Scotland route by 40 per cent and also to enable the
launch of services to Belfast City.
Moreover, Jersey European has introduced a daily Manchester-Jersey service
and a Saturday-only Manchester-Guernsey link.
At the same time the two main players - BA and BM - have made it clear that
Europe is their target. This was illustrated recently by BM's decision to
axe its loss-making Heathrow to Liverpool route and expand its European
services using the slots vacated at Heathrow.
These slots - the take-off and landing allocations at Heathrow - are a major
source of annoyance for domestic carriers. As the world's busiest
international airport, Heathrow has to cater for the many international
airlines that want to come into the airport. The move last year to allow
more carriers into Heathrow under the government's policy of deregulating
civil aviation has put considerably more pressure on domestic services.
Ironically, however, it is these domestic services which act as a 'feeder'
into the international routes out of Heathrow. Some business travellers are
forced to drive or go by train/tube to Heathrow simply because of the
non-availability of a connecting service from their local airport.
Thus the decision by Air UK, Britain's third largest scheduled airline, to
base its operations at Stansted Airport in Essex. Stansted last year saw a
radical improvement in its facilities with a Pounds 400m development of a
new terminal.
But it has faced a difficult task over the past year, following the fall-off
in international air travel after the Gulf War, to persuade business
travellers to use its services.
Air UK, however, believes it provides a different option for business
travellers from that offered by BA or BM, especially for those based in
north or east London, the Midlands and the eastern part of the country,
where access to Stansted is more convenient than to Heathrow or Gatwick.
The airline flies more than 1,100 flights a week to 15 destinations within
the UK. Not all of these are out of Stansted: for example, it has just added
an extra direct early morning flight from Norwich to Aberdeen, providing six
flights every day during the week.
While BA's Shuttle services to main UK cities continue to be a profitable
and important operation for the airline, it has realised that it cannot
afford to devote too many resources to compete as efficiently on small
regional routes as well as major international links.
The airline is currently in talks with its staff over streamlining its
regional operations out of Birmingham, Manchester, and Glasgow although it
stresses that it has no intention of pulling out of these cities.
But the opportunities clearly exist for more niche airlines to meet the
needs of business air travellers in the UK.

FT  11 MAY 92 / Survey of Business Air Travel (3): Focus shifts to the
ground - How services may be improved
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID CHURCHILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE NEXT revolution in business air travel in the 1990s will most probably
not come from enhanced in-flight services but from the less glamorous, but
arguably more important, improvements in services on the ground.
The way in which business travellers book flights, get to and from the
airport, check in and then make best use of their time in the terminal is
becoming as important to the business traveller as the size of seat
in-flight. But with international airlines unlikely to be in the position,
given the economics of international air travel, significantly to increase
the size of seat for business travellers this decade, the attention of the
airlines is thus focused firmly on the ground. British Airways, for example,
recently opened a 20,000 sq ft lounge at Heathrow's terminal one for its
Club Europe passengers which it claims to be one of the largest at any
European airport. The aim is to provide an area for frequent business
travellers away from the bustle of the main terminal. The lounge has some 40
telephones as well as fax machines and photocopiers.
The importance of this lounge is its capacity: it can hold up to 400
travellers at any one time, which is estimated by BA to be in line with
demand. BA is not alone in improving lounge facilities at its home base:
most other international airlines are seeking to improve their business
lounges at their operational bases. KLM, for example, has opened a new
lounge similar in scope to BA's at Amsterdam's Schipol airport; Singapore
Airlines has an opulent lounge at Changi; while Air France's facilities at
terminal two at Charles de Gaulle airport in Paris are spacious and stylish.
Over at terminal one, where most other carriers fly from, the story is
different with far less salubrious accommodation for business travellers.
The problem, however, for travellers is gaining access to airline lounges
when flying away from the airline's home base. Even when their preferred
carrier has a lounge, this is often small and cramped. Executives frequently
find they are reduced to joining the throngs in the main departure lounges.
Clearly, this is an area where the airlines are keen to improve their
services, although the problem is restrictions on space at most
international terminals.
Probably the most significant on-the-ground development in recent years has
been the introduction of free limousine services for some business
travellers. It was Mr Richard Branson's Virgin Atlantic which first brought
this innovation to the UK; originally its Upper Class passengers qualified
for a limousine to and from the airport only within a radius of 40 miles
from the airport. Now it offers a limousine transfer from any mainland point
in the UK.
Other international airlines have, not surprisingly, emulated Virgin's
approach rather than lose valuable executive travellers. But not all offer
this service from anywhere in the UK, so it is worth checking when making a
reservation if a limousine is included. BA, which has flirted with the idea
of providing similar facilities, has so far found it impracticable to offer
this service in the UK because of the large number of flights it operates.
Limousine services are not available at all international airports because
of government restrictions on 'inducements' to travellers. Thus business
travellers to and from Tokyo's Narita airport are offered by Virgin, for
example a 'limousine bus service' instead of individual transport.
Those travellers preferring to arrive by car have welcomed new developments
at Heathrow airport this year aimed at giving a fairer deal to the business
traveller. Mr Barry Gibson, Heathrow's retailing director, explains that 'we
were using prices as a deterrent in the short-term car park because of
congestion, but we failed to understand the different types of passenger. We
weren't offering a business product, and that's 50 per cent of the market at
Heathrow.'
Heathrow now offers over 21,000 car parking spaces at three classes of park
 -short-term, business and long-term. It is the business park development
which offers most for executive travellers: designed for those who usually
go away for two to four days and who previously used (at great expense) the
short-term car park or were forced to hike to the long-term parks.
The new business parks offer special three-day rates plus a rapid transfer
system from car park to terminal. Though there have been reports of teething
problems, most executives find the system is a cheap and convenient way of
taking their car to the airport.
But others prefer to pay more to use a commercial valet parking operation at
the airport. Under these schemes, the car is dropped off at the airport and,
on the executive's return, a call is made from the terminal to have the car
waiting outside.
Car rental companies are also following this trend towards seamless service
on the ground. Avis, for example, has taken advantage of new computer
technology to offer its Preferred Service. Under this scheme, frequent
renters can arrive at a car rental office, see their name and car bay number
in lights, and go immediately to their car, which contains both keys and
rental agreement.
Other efforts to ease the path of the executive traveller on the ground are
being launched all the time. Last month, for example, the ABC World Airways
Guide, published by the Reed Travel Group, launched a special simplified
guide for business travellers.
This guide enables executives to steer themselves through the complexities
of airline schedules, with full details of airline business classes,
terminal plans and other essential information.
But perhaps the area where most still needs to be done to improve the lot of
the business air traveller on the ground is at check-in. Changes have been
introduced to make life easier for the travelling executive - such as the
check-in facilities for Gatwick at London's Victoria rail station - but many
of those flying first class or business class from most terminals can still
find themselves having to queue. The airline that can get this right for the
1990s will be ahead of the game in wooing the business traveller on the
ground.

FT  11 MAY 92 / Survey of Business Air Travel (2): New names cross the North
Atlantic - The changing shape of competition on key routes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ANY PASSENGER who shunned the North Atlantic during the recession, but who
now decides that business prospects are good enough to return to the skies
to search for new orders overseas is likely to encounter a rather different
world. In the space of less than a year, the shape of competition on North
Atlantic routes has changed radically. The collapse of Pan Am last year
showed that the North Atlantic is no friend to an airline in trouble, while
the other grand old name of the business, TWA, is languishing under the
protection of US bankruptcy laws. These two have been replaced on the North
Atlantic by the two biggest US airlines, American and United.
It is more than just a change of names. American and United are the fit
survivors of the viciously competitive US domestic market: United has more
than half as many employees again as British Airways, it has almost 500
passenger aircraft and carried 170,000 passengers a day even in last year's
depressed market.
American is the bigger of the two across the Atlantic. If the name is
unfamiliar to any European business passengers it is because a year ago it
had less than one third of its present capacity operating on routes between
North America and the UK. American and United have announced their arrival
in Europe with a storm of advertising and promotion. Passengers are still
scarce, and ticket discounting widespread, but two are determined to grab
market share.
The potential rewards are high in this, the busiest of long-haul air
corridors. There is already evidence that the arrival of the two newcomers
is heralding rising prices across the North Atlantic. Published fares in
1992 are 8-10 per cent higher than last year, says Mr Paul Karos, airlines
analyst at First Boston in New York. Although discounting means that
published fares bear little resemblance to the actual prices paid for
tickets, it is easy for airlines to rein back the discounts if business
picks up.
The conditions for such a recovery are in place. Not only is there optimism
about the prospects for the world economy as a whole, but capacity can be
filled more quickly because the Boeing 747 fleet operated by TWA and Pan Am
has been replaced by a mixture of smaller Boeing 767s, DC-10s, as well as
747s.
Capacity will be most intensively utilised on flights to and from the UK,
says Mr Karos, partly because of the change of aircraft. This conclusion is
supported by a Financial Times survey of the cost of business class and
first class flights between various European centres and New York (see
table). London has the most expensive fares, Paris is in second place, and
Zurich, Brussels and Amsterdam are close behind.
Flights from the UK are more than just the cherry on the North Atlantic
cake. The UK is by far the biggest European market for non-stop flights to
and from the US. One third of all transatlantic capacity uses UK airports.
British Airways is the biggest operator, taking 40 per cent of that market.
In second place is American Airlines with 14 per cent, United has 11 per
cent and Virgin 10 per cent, according to a Reuters survey.
Although airlines are trying to push fares higher, discounting is rife:
there has already been one vicious price war this year on the North Atlantic
which saw some fares fall by a third in one week.
Competition is also likely to intensify on fronts other than just fares.
European airines are catching up with their US counterparts in one of main
marketing weapons used by US airlines: frequent flyer programmes. These have
been enormously popular - Iata says that 97 per cent of business travellers
resident in the US are members. The figures are much lower in Europe partly
because European carriers have in the past participated with limited
enthusiasm as junior partners with US carriers.
This is changing. 'We are now seeing the European carriers launching their
own programmes,' says Mr David Coltman, vice-president of United Airlines'
Atlantic division.
British Airways is leading the way. Until a year ago, BA participated in
frequent flyer programmes operated by United Airlines, American Airlines and
others. In the spring of 1991 it began its 'Air Miles' promotion. It has now
linked it with other incentives aimed at business travellers, such as use of
executive lounges.
Both Air France and the German carrier Lufthansa are said by industry
sources to be preparing to launch similar schemes.
Frequent flyer programme are popular with passengers, but they have their
dangers for the industry. Airlines acknowledge privately that the backlog of
free seats to be redeemed could squeeze out fare-paying passengers.
One solution is to have strict time windows on when the free seats offers
can be exercised. But this might reduce the attractiveness of the schemes.
Marketing strategists are also aware that as more airlines jump on the
frequent flyer programme bandwagon, their effectiveness as marketing tools -
to differentiate between rival airlines - diminishes.
In the knowledge that frequent flyer programmes could become progressively
less effective, US carriers have been carrying out their own private surveys
of what UK business passengers value on transatlantic flights. The most
requested items include sleeper seats, seat selection at time of purchase,
not having to sit next to anyone, and a special lounge.
Virgin Atlantic's launch last week of a Mid Class, with wider seats for
economy class passengers who have paid full price for their tickets,
reflects these priorities. But Virgin's is also a move that should raise the
average fare it receives for a ticket. As such, it is part of the
industry-wide strategy of raising fares.
This strategy can only be helped if economic recovery pushes up demand. In
an increasingly liberalised environment, competition is the main force that
might limit the rises.
'The new US rivals are stronger than the companies they replace,' admits Mr
Paul Griffiths, Virgin Atlantic's commercial director.
Business passengers must hope that the market will make sure any price rises
are small and accompanied by genuine improvements in service.

FT  11 MAY 92 / Survey of Business Air Travel (1): An Aladdin's cave of
inducement - As the world tentatively begins to recover from recession,
airlines are putting in place programmes to ensure that they win a growing
share of the business market. European airlines are adopting many schemes
common in the US
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
BUSINESS AIR travellers are being wooed by the airlines as never before.
Airline marketing teams have been working ferociously to win passengers and
establish market share before economic recovery brings business passengers
flocking to the travel agents.
This is in stark contrast with the past 18 months. The trough in world
economic activity saw airlines holding on grimly to existence, with varying
success. As corporate revenues dwindled in businesses worldwide, company
executives cut spending in many departments including air travel.
This matters a lot to airlines. Business air travellers occupy a special
place in the hearts and wallets of industry executives. 'We make our money
at the front of the aircraft,' says one US manager. At Lufthansa, the German
state carrier, the top 20 per cent of customers provides 56 per cent of
revenues on its European routes.
In the spring of 1992, there is much talk of recovery but little sign of it.
Carriers are continuing to sell heavily discounted tickets, and last month
US airlines began a price war on their domestic routes. It followed
cut-throat competition on lucrative North Atlantic routes which saw fares
fall by one third.
The battle has been joined with such ferocity because this is a critical
moment for the industry. Recession-bound customers are on the point of
returning to the skies and airlines feel they must now buy that most elusive
of commodities, customer loyalty.
Discounted fares represent only one gem in an Aladdin's cave of inducements
to fly. The early 1990s has seen an explosion in the the number of gaudy
incentives aimed at securing business passenger loyalty. They include
special lounges, limousines to the airport, free gifts chosen from the
catalogues of expensive stores, on-board massages, beauty therapy,
individual video screens on board and more.
Most popular are frequent flyer programmes, where passengers collect points
on the basis of the distance travelled and then use the points later to
obtain upgrades to business, or first class, or free tickets.
Frequent flyer programmes were developed in the US and have now spread to
the UK. Large continental European airlines are thought to be studying the
idea and 'it is only a matter of time before they launch their own
programmes,' says an executive of one US airline.
The attraction of frequent flyer programmes to passengers is strong. A
survey of business travellers by the International Air Transport Association
last week shows that 98 per cent of US passengers were members of a scheme.
The figure for UK resident business travellers was 63 per cent.
But the power of such programmes is limited. The same Iata survey showed it
ranked only fourth on the list of passenger preferences. And giving away
seats might be simple in a recession, but airlines risk losing valuable fare
paying passengers as points are redeemed after the recovery is under way.
The search is on, therefore, for new ways to attract passengers.
The flavour of 1992 is 'product segmentation'. Now that computers minutely
analyse changing patterns of ticket demand, airlines can create products for
very specific groups of passengers. Virgin Atlantic Airways last week
launched a 'Mid Class' ticket intended for the small minority of economy
class passengers who buy full-price tickets. These passengers are almost
entirely travelling on business.
Virgin's move is classic airline management: improve service to the business
passengers and leave price cuts for leisure travellers.
The Iata survey supports this strategy. It showed about 90 per cent of
business travellers declare bigger seats to be the most desired benefit of
travelling in business class.
Other airlines are following a similar route, with small independent
carriers quickest off the mark. Austria's Lauda Air last week reduced its
three abreast business class seating to two on its London to Vienna route.
Canadian Airlines International is offering business class seats to
passengers who pay full economy class fares. And TAT, in France, is
advertising its short haul European services and 'all business class'
although this refers more to the flexibility of the ticket than bigger
seats.'
In the deregulated US market, such innovations have been common practice for
a long time. Some carriers added business class to previously two-class
domestic aircraft routes late last year.
But the price war on domestic US travel last month was more about cutting
the published prices of business class and full-fare economy tickets than
bigger seats. The move was partly to do with the continuing recession: the
Iata survey showed that 28 per cent of passengers worked for companies which
had cut their travel budgets. In 10 per cent of cases, the cut had been of
more than 20 per cent.
It was also to do with the precarious state of the US airline business. The
biggest US airlines, American and United, which initiated the cuts, wanted
to reduce the plethora of discounted fares. By so doing they might cut the
ground from beneath their ailing rivals such as TWA and Continental.
These two, and others, and have filed for protection from their creditors
under US Chapter 11 legislation. Mr Robert Crandall, head of American
Airlines, has been the vocal leader of a lobby which accuses the US
bankruptcy laws of allowing weak airlines to damage strong ones. The laws
are designed to allow failed businesses to keep functioning while a rescue
package is put together. Mr Crandall and others allege this allow carriers
to set fares only to meet current costs, not investment programmes.
When recovery comes the shape of the battleground will change. Airlines will
want to soften their sales pitches; they will want to give high paying
business clients the personal touch they have paid for, but more cheaply
than by giving away seats through frequent flyer programmes.
One way to do this is through technology. Automated check-in machines that
speed passengers past check-in desk queues are already being installed in
airports. These machines print out a boarding card after the passenger has
fed in a ticket and specified smoking or non-smoking and window or aisle
preferences. They are already working in some airports such as Charles de
Gaulle in Paris. British Airways intends to begin installing automated
boarding card machines at its check-ins around the world later this year.
To Virgin Atlantic, this approach is abhorrent. 'We are a people based
industry. The check-in is the human contact with the passenger, we don't
want to replace that because it degrades customer service,' says Mr Paul
Griffiths, Virgin's commercial director.
Mr Chris Byron, head of service delivery at BA sees no conflict between the
impersonality of automation and the need to provide a personal touch.
'Queues are not the best place for personal service. The objective is to
speed up the processes and not to reduce the number of people involved on
the airline side.' He says that automation can help airports that are
already overcrowded to cope with the increasing passenger flows.
Baggage is next in line. BA is already using bar coded baggage tags that are
machine read in the new Terminal 4 at London's Heathrow airport to direct
baggage to the correct aircraft. The bar codes will be replaced over the
next two years by magnetic stripes, which can contain more information, such
as which freight container the luggage is in.
Such developments are a far cry from the expense of giving away free seats
through frequent flyer programmes, or reducing the number of seats. For the
airlines it is a means of adding reliability to their service while keeping
costs under control. It is an unspectacular kind of service that could have
its day, if and when economic recovery pushes demand for air travel closer
to the level of supply.

Shares in Dean &amp; Bowes fell 2p to 8p after the contracting and construction
group warned that its financial and trading position had 'materially
worsened' and that it was only able to continue trading with the support of
its bankers.
The group which in February sold the pub refurbishment business to Mr
Stephen Dean, its former chairman and chief executive, said it had now
negotiated the sale of the Plantonoff and Harris joinery business to Mr Dean
for pounds 120,000 in cash. Further disposals might be necessary and there
were plans to change the name of the business to Chequers Group.

FT  09 MAY 92 / BCCI's UK-based creditors to reject settlement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN FRIEDMAN and RICHARD DONKIN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH-BASED creditors of the collapsed Bank of Credit and Commerce
International are to reject as inadequate the Dollars 1.7bn (Pounds 960m)
settlement negotiated between the liquidator and the majority shareholder.
Rejection of the deal, to be put before the High Court in London on Monday,
was formally agreed on Thursday at a meeting of creditors representing
British deposits after they received independent legal advice.
Private criticism of the deal had been building up among creditors for some
time. Officials involved in the BCCI settlement say the High Court may
simply open its hearing and then adjourn it to avoid having to make an
immediate ruling.
The creditors' stance will pose a dilemma for Sir Donald Nich-olls, the
vice-chancellor, who is presiding over the settlement hearings, as the views
of creditors would be expected to carry substantial weight in any court
decision. It could also mark a defeat for Mr Brian Smouha, the Touche Ross
partner in charge of the BCCI liquidation.
At the heart of creditors' objections is the view that the government of Abu
Dhabi, the majority shareholder of BCCI, should have far more responsibility
to creditors than Mr Smouha's deal provides. The Smouha/Abu Dhabi deal would
offer creditors only 30 to 40 cents on the dollar.
The creditors are arguing that liquidators should not give up their claims
under Dollars 3.06bn of promissory notes issued by Abu Dhabi last year when
the bank was carrying out a restructuring programme. They are also unhappy
at having to sign over all legal rights to claim against the majority
shareholders.
The likely rejection was foreshadowed by the disclosure this week of a
letter to the BCCI creditors committee from the Faisal Islamic Bank of Egypt
and three other Arab creditor banks, which opposed the proposed Smouha deal
as being inadequate.
Approval for the package in the High Court is an essential first step in a
series of approvals needed in Luxembourg and the Cayman Islands. Finally the
agreement would need the blessing of creditors representing 70 per cent of
the Dollars 10bn of liabilities identified to date.

FT  09 MAY 92 / Municipal Mutual in talks with rivals after big losses:
Company's solvency margin has fallen below 30% level
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MUNICIPAL MUTUAL, the UK's ninth largest general insurer, was yesterday in
talks about its future with two other insurers.
Municipal, which is owned by its policyholders and insures nine out of 10
local authorities in the UK, is talking to one UK and one continental
European insurer about a possible transfer of its general business, which
generated net premium income of Pounds 572.3m in 1990.
Chairman, Mr Maurice Stonefrost, admitted the company, formed in 1903, might
well disappear as an independent entity. Any deal would represent the most
important restructuring in the British general insurance market since the
takeover of Cornhill by Germany's Allianz in 1986.
The talks began this week and are at an early stage. They follow heavy
trading losses in the past two years which have cut Municipal's solvency
margin - the yardstick measuring net assets as a percentage of non-life
premium income - below the 30 per cent level regarded by industry regulators
as adequate.
Mr Stonefrost yesterday insist-ed Municipal was solvent but said the company
had been in contact with the Department of Trade and Industry because of
concerns about its solvency margin.
Like other insurers, Municipal has been hard hit by rising claims and
intense price competition in the UK market.
Underwriting losses rose to Pounds 140.4m in 1990 and 1991 was at least as
bad, although final figures are not yet available.
The company has been hit by rising claims on employers' and public liability
policies and could have insufficient reserves to meet future claims on these
policies, which often emerge many years after the policy is written.
Mr Stonefrost said that during 1990 and 1991 'claims experience was of a
scale and nature much greater than had been anticipated or provided for'.
The group has been badly hit by rising arson claims by schools - most of
them the result of fires started by children.
The company has been especially hard hit by price competition as it moved
aggressively to reduce its dependence on its traditional local authority
business. In 1990, it won a contract to write household insurance for
Cheltenham and Gloucester Building Society on the basis of substantially
lower premiums than its rivals.
Gross premium income at Municipal and its operating subsidiary Municipal
General rose from Pounds 425m in 1986 to Pounds 794m in 1990. The company
also reduced its reliance on reinsurance, retaining more risks on its own
books.
Municipal has already stopped some business because of concerns about
solvency. Last month, it sold its Australian subsidiary and transferred its
commercial lines account to Groupe des Assurances Nationales - the French
insurer which plans to build a larger presence in the UK market.

FT  09 MAY 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow subdued as rate cut hopes
fade

Wall Street
US EQUITIES traded in a narrow range as stronger payroll figures for April
dampened hopes that the Federal Reserve would make an early cut in interest
rates, writes Karen Zagor in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average was 6.04 higher at 3,369.41 on paltry
turnover of less than 169m shares. Advancing broadly equalled declining
issues, at 834 against 810. The Standard &amp; Poor 500 was 0.20 higher at
416.05 and the Nasdaq composite eased 1.41 to 585.75. On Thursday, the Dow
closed 6.04 lower at 3,363.37.
Evidence of a slow but steady economic recovery was provided by April's
employment report which showed a rise in non-farm payrolls of 126,000,
considerably above most predictions. The civilian unemployment rate fell to
7.2 per cent from 7.3 per cent and the March non-payroll increase was
revised to 39,000 from 19,000.
The employment report stifled speculation that the Federal Reserve would
ease monetary policy. Yesterday the Fed signalled that its policy was on
hold by arranging Dollars 1.5bn of customer repurchase agreements. The
operation, which adds reserves to the banking system, occurred when Fed
Funds were trading at 3 3/4 per cent, the Fed's perceived target for the
rate.
Pinelands soared Dollars 5 3/4 to Dollars 17 3/4 in active trading on
reports that the New Jersey-based television station operator had accepted a
takeover offer of Dollars 18 a share from Chris-Craft Industries. Shares in
Chris-Craft fell Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 26 5/8 .
Trading was heavy in a number of blue chip stocks including Boeing, down
Dollars  1/8 at Dollars 44 1/8 , IBM, off Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 93 1/4 and
Chase Manhattan, up Dollars  7/8 at Dollars 29 1/2 .
Liz Claiborne rose Dollars 2 1/8 to Dollars 37 7/8 after the apparel company
said it had offered to buy the operating assets of Russ Togs, which is
operating under protection of Chapter 11 of the bankruptcy code.
The transportation sector reversed some previous day's losses, the Dow Jones
Transportation Average climbing 4.67 to 1,399.66. Airline issues were mixed,
with AMR, parent of American Airlines, unchanged at Dollars 68 5/8 , Delta
Air Lines adding Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 61 3/4 and UAL, parent of United
Airlines off Dollars 1 to Dollars 124.
Railroad stocks, which contributed to the average's decline on Thursday,
turned higher. Burlington Northern added Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 45 7/8 ,
Norfolk Southern rose Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 65 and Consolidated Rail
firmed Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 91 1/2 .
Transco Energy climbed Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 13 after the natural gas and
coal producer said it expected to take a first quarter charge of 66 cents a
share to settle a lawsuit with Global Marine.
In over-the-counter trading, Sun Microsystems improved Dollars  1/4 to
Dollars 29 3/4 after a Morgan Stanley analyst upgraded his rating on the
stock to 'buy' from 'hold'.
American Funeral Services was quoted at Dollars 10. An initial public
offering of 1.8m shares was priced at Dollars 10 a share.
Canada
TORONTO stocks closed modestly higher in moderate trading, ending an
uneventful week on a positive note.
The composite index rose 11.53 points to close at 3,374.43. Advances
outnumbered declines 289 to 231 on volume of 24.195m shares, up from
21,714,000 shares. Trading value climbed to CDollars 267.2m.

FT  09 MAY 92 / London Stock Exchange: Hanson springs surprise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, JOEL KIBAZO, COLIN MILHAM and PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE London market was shaken late yesterday by the news that Hanson had
placed its 20m shares in ICI.
US broker Goldman Sachs said after the market closed last night: 'We can
confirm that we purchased the shares. It is a deal worth approximately
Dollars 500m (Pounds 280m).' Analysts said last night that the figure
represented 1400p a share for Hanson.
Goldman's bald statement marks the end of a year of intense speculation that
began when UK securities house Smith New Court raided the market to pick up
the stock - which represents 2.82 per cent of ICI's equity - at 1194 1/2 p.
The first clue that something was afoot yesterday came in the London Traded
Options market where, unusually, Hanson was the most heavily traded stock
option.
The market was surprised that the shares were sold at a premium and this
fuelled a strong belief that at least 10m shares went to US investors - who
still believe the UK offers bargains - at 1410p a share.
Mr Charles Lambert, chemicals analyst with Smith New Court, said yesterday:
'The timing was very good and it was a gutsy deal. I think there was a
general air of expectancy that something would happen but everyone believed
the deal would be done at a discount to the market.'
Hanson closed 2 3/4 better at 238 1/2 p with 18m shares traded while ICI
ended the day 17 up at 1403p with a recorded turnover of 20m.
P&amp;O in demand
P&amp;O turned out to be one of the star performers of the session as the shares
raced forward on a combination of a broker's recommendation, a shortage of
stock and an upbeat AGM statement. The day's advance started after agency
broker James Capel reiterated its buy recommendation on the stock, with
analyst Ms Yasmin Harrison saying: 'It's a cheap recovery stock with most of
the uncertainity now out of the way.'
Demand was further boosted by a positive statement at the company's annual
meeting. A squeeze developed around lunchtime, with one marketmaker reported
to have been caught short, which led briefly to a 'backwardation', a point
at which the highest bid is above the best offer in the market. The shares
eventually closed up 22 at 540p, on turnover of 3.5m shares.
Vodafone retreated after a bright start on news that Cellnet was planning to
introduce its GSM digital cellular network next year, 12 months ahead of
schedule. The Cellnet announcement was apparently made at a staff
conference, where it was also stated that price cuts would be introduced at
the same time. Vodafone shares, which touched 372p, closed at 369p, up 5 on
the day, in busy volume of 6.4m.
Overseas buyers were keen on British Telecom partly paid, the shares
advancing 5 to 132 1/2 p in hectic turnover of 26m. BT fully-paid rose 6 to
353 1/2 p with 8.9m dealt.
Investors continued to bail out of BP following disappointing first-quarter
figures on Thursday, the shares falling 8 to 251 1/2 p - the biggest
percentage fall of any of the stocks in the FT-SE Index - with 24m traded.
The stock was said to have received some support from securities house Hoare
Govett but most analysts were increasingly bearish with Nomura the latest to
cut its profit forecast. Dealers also said that Standard &amp; Poors, the US
credit rating agency, had put the company on 'downgrade alert'.
British Gas fell 4 1/2 to 256 1/2 p against the trend amid fears about the
impact of possible future price cuts.
Reed International gained 18 to 593p, helped by a research note by
investment bank S. G. Warburg and a stock shortage. Central Television
jumped 35 to 1433p helped by a more positive recommendation from Kleinwort
Benson's media team, which put the company on its buy list and raised its
1992 profit forecast to Pounds 38.5m.
Cadbury-Schweppes were active, on turnover of 4.2m shares, climbing 17 to
487p, as bid speculation increased after Hanson disposed of its investment
in ICI.
Hillsdown slipped 5 to 180p, as a hefty 7.3m shares were traded.
Unilever rose 14 to 944p ahead of next Friday's first quarter results.
Asda was again very active, as 38m shares changed hands, with the price
rising  3/4 to 28 3/4 p. J. Sainsbury improved 4 1/2 to 437p ahead of next
week's results, while Shoprite continued to weaken on profit-taking, sliding
20 to 467p. Sears, which reported disappointing profits this week, rose 2 at
99p, recovering part of Thursday fall, on turnover of 21m shares.
A squeeze in BAA as the company agreed an office development deal with
British Airways sent the shares climbing 16 to 645p. But continued talk of a
rights issue at BA weakened the shares and they eased a penny to 283p.
Tiphook jumped 17 to 446p, following a buy recommendation from County
NatWest.
Economic optimism boosted the engineering and motor sectors. The day's
outstanding performances included IMI, up 6 to 287p, after a favourable
annual meeting, Smiths Industries, 11 better at 335p, as the company
continued making presentations to investors, and BBA Group, 11 harder at
157p. Vickers also jumped 11, to 173p, after Albert E Sharp, the
Midland-based broker, was reported to have increased its current year
forecast by Pounds 9m to Pounds 30m after a visit to the company.
The brewing and drinks sector was very firm. Grand Metropolitan gained 10 to
510p, with Allied-Lyons up 9 at 638p and Guinness 4 higher at 632p,
following a recommendation from Daiwa. Mr Dermot Carr, drinks analyst at the
Japanese securities house, said EC draft proposals for harmonisation of
spirits excise duty across Europe should boost the shares in these
companies, although he pointed out there is some disagreement over the
minimum duty rate.
Several leading brewers, including Allied, Grand Met and Bass, rising 8 to
645p, report their results in the next two weeks and are expected to make
encouraging statements about economic recovery. Hoare Govett also issued a
buy recommendation for Allied and Guinness, plus Bass.
French stockbroker Strauss Generale, Strauss Turnbull's insurance analyst,
spoke at the morning meeting in favour of Commercial Union (up 4 at 500p)
and against Royal Insurance (down 3 at 229p)

SHARES in Pinelands, a New Jersey-based company, soared Dollars 5 7/8 to

company had agreed to be acquired by Chris-Craft Industries for Dollars 18 a
share or about Dollars 310m, writes Karen Zagor in New York.
If the deal goes ahead, it will allow Chris-Craft to become one of the
largest US non-network television station businesses by giving the group a
foothold in the important New York market. Chris-Craft's BHC Communications
division operates seven stations.
On Wall Street, shares in Chris-Craft slipped Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 26 3/4

FT  09 MAY 92 / International Company News: State to take control at
Nordbanken
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE SWEDISH government is to take full control of Nordbanken, the country's
second largest commercial bank, in a SKr20bn (Dollars 3.38bn) rescue
operation.
The state's intervention is designed to save Nordbanken from possible
collapse due to mounting credit losses and to help the bank's restructuring
in preparation for its rapid privatisation.
Under the proposed changes Nordbanken will be divided into two separate
operations. Its normal commercial banking activities will continue while a
newly formed subsidiary, Securum, with an initial SKr60bn balance sheet,
will deal with non-performing loans, property administration and other
problem areas.
The state already owns 77.3 per cent of Nordbanken. Yesterday the bank's
other main shareholder - Nobel Industries - said it had accepted the offer
of SKr21 a share for its 12.6 per cent of Nordbanken. The total cost of
acquiring the outstanding shares is estimated to be around SKr2bn.
The government's move stems from the continuing deterioration in
Nordbanken's finances. This year alone its credit losses - due to a
persistently weak property and finance market - are expected to rise to
between SKr6bn and SKr8bn.
The bank said as a result it would not be able by the autumn to maintain an
adequate capital adequacy ratio despite last October's move by the state to
subscribe for and guarantee a SKr5.2bn new share issue. For 1991 Nordbanken
made a SKr5.8bn loss.
Mr Bjorn Wahlstrom, Nordbanken chairman, said yesterday that the only
alternative to state intervention would have been a dramatic contraction and
a drastic fall in the valuation of the bank.
The bank said the SKr20bn rescue package will cover guarantees, loans,
capital injections and other measures needed for the financing of Securum.
The Ministry of Finance said its proposal would ensure Nordbanken could grow
into a stable bank with a strong capital base and good level of
profitability. 'These are the necessary conditions for the sale of
Nordbanken to the private sector which the government wants to do as soon
possible,' it said.
Credit Suisse First Boston, the merchant bank, has been given the task of
examining the possibilities of finding a new owner for the bank.
Yesterday's announcement brought an angry reaction from Mr Curt Olsson,
chairman of Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken, Sweden's largest commercial bank.
Mr Olsson found it 'difficult' to criticise the state for saving Nordbanken
from an acute crisis, but the decision he said would lead to a 'serious
distortion of competition in Swedish banking'.

retail group
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE GERMAN arm of Woolworth, the US retail giant, has taken an indirect
stake of 6.25 per cent in Horten, Germany's fourth largest retail group, for
an undisclosed sum.
F. W. Woolworth, which operates 316 retail stores in Germany, is buying a 25
per cent stake in Deutsche Gesellschaft fur Anlagenverwaltung (Degav), a
holding company owning 25 per cent of Horten.
Woolworth said it regarded the holding as a long-term investment in the
German department store sector, made especially secure because of Horten's
extensive property portfolio.
Following a restructuring this year, Horten is indirectly controlled via
Westdeutsche Landesbank, the Dusseldorf-based regional bank. It has a 60 per
cent stake in a holding company which owns 49.9 per cent of the retailer,
and a further 1.1 per cent stake directly.
The remaining 75 per cent of Degav is owned by Deutsche Bank, Germany's
largest bank.
Woolworth's German operations had sales of DM2.9bn (Dollars 1.75bn) in 1991,
and net earnings of DM78.3m.

FT  09 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Herald is sold to management for Pounds 74m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A TEAM of managers and editors yesterday completed the Pounds 74m management
buy-out of the Herald, formerly the Glasgow Herald, one of Scotland's
quality newspapers. It was purchased from George Outram, which is owned by
Lonrho.
The MBO, which involves funds with a total value of Pounds 93.5m, was
organised by Robert Fleming, the merchant bank, and is backed by Scottish
banks and financial institutions.
It was welcomed in Scotland as the return to Scottish ownership of a
significant formerly Scottish-owned company. Lonrho acquired Outram in 1979
when it bought Scottish &amp; Universal Investments. Outram is being sold to
reduce Lonrho's substantial debt.
In addition to The Herald, Outram publishes the Evening Times, the Glasgow
evening paper, and magazines including the Scottish Farmer. The sale does
not include The Observer.
Pearson, owner of the Financial Times, had offered Pounds 70m for the
remainder of Outram, but was outbid by the MBO team and did not wish to get
involved in an auction.
The MBO, which has formed a company called Caledonian Newspaper Publishing,
was the inspiration of Mr Liam Kane, managing director of Outram. Its
executive directors include Mr Arnold Kemp, editor of The Herald, and Mr
George McKechnie, editor of the Evening Times.
Under the deal debt of Pounds 43m has been underwritten by Bank of Scotland,
Royal Bank of Scotland and Robert Fleming to finance the acquisition and
Caledonian's future working capital requirements. Mezzanine debt of Pounds
10m has been underwritten by 3i and Fleming. Some Pounds 40.5m of equity has
been underwritten by Fleming.
The executive directors will initially own 6 per cent of the ordinary
equity, while 3 per cent will be set aside for employees through an employee
share scheme. Outram, which employs 1,000 people, made pre-tax profits of
Pounds 5.6m on sales of Pounds 58.4m in the year to September 30 1991.
Mr Kane said last night that profitability had to improve, and there would
be changes in the way the papers were run, which would be discussed with
staff. 'I don't think staff should be nervous,' he added. Editorial
independence was guaranteed.
He said he hoped to install a full page electronic composition system by the
end of the year, and add new colour printing units.
Some Pounds 12m of the capital raised is being used to eliminate leasing
finance from the balance sheet.

<TEXT>
A Pounds 3.43m provision against an associate, taken as an extraordinary
item, left Linton Park, the tea planting, food processing and engineering
group, with a loss for the 1991 year of Pounds 2.27m, against Pounds 5.4m
profits.
Pre-tax profits were 45 per cent lower at Pounds 4.42m, against Pounds
8.07m, after a higher net interest charge of Pounds 1.79m (Pounds 1.47m) and
lower income from associates and other participating interests of Pounds
431,000 (Pounds 1.27m). Turnover fell from Pounds 128.4m to Pounds 124.3m.
Earnings came out at 8.8p (25.1p). A final dividend of 10.5p makes an
unchanged 13p total.
Ellis &amp; Everard, the chemical distributor, has sold two offshoots - Midkem
and Dimex International - to Yule Catto for Pounds 2.5m cash.
The disposals were consistent with Ellis's strategy of concentrating on its
core chemical distribution businesses. The group, which in February sold the
pub refurbishment business to Mr Stephen Dean, its former chairman and chief
executive, said it had now negotiated the sale of the Platonoff and Harris
joinery business to Mr Dean for Pounds 120,000.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
BLETCHLEY MOTOR Group is raising Pounds 2.1m in a share issue to fund two
dealership sites for Japanese cars.
The placing and open offer, on a 1-for-2 basis, is priced at 150p a share.
The market price closed 2p down at 168p yesterday. Bletchley also announced
that it was moving from the USM to the main market.
The two sites to be developed are one for Nissan at Letchworth,
Hertfordshire, costing Pounds 560,000, and one for Toyota at Luton,
Bedfordshire, costing Pounds 850,000. So far the group has held franchises
for Rover, Ford, Vauxhall and Leyland DAF.
Mr David Dunn, chairman, whose stake is being diluted from 47 to 31 per cent
by the share issue, said the total investment in the two sites would amount
to Pounds 2.1m, taking up all the issue proceeds.
The group chose not to borrow more money as its gearing was running at 157
per cent. However, the bulk of the Pounds 9m net debt was related to the
expanding contract hire fleet. Without it, gearing would fall to 54 per
cent.
Last year Bletchley reversed the decline in pre-tax profit, making Pounds
753,000 on turnover of Pounds 60.2m.

FT  09 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Hongkong Bank will not give up Midland
'lightly' - The Battle For Midland
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BARCHARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HONGKONG BANK yesterday said that it would remain interested in buying
Midland Bank - even if its present bid failed.
Asked what would happen if the sale of Midland was delayed until the autumn
by the referral to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission of Lloyds Bank's
rival bid, Mr Bernard Asher, Hongkong Bank executive director, said: 'We
have a long and fulfilling relationship with Midland Bank going back nearly
five years.
'It is not something we would give up lightly because the logic is so strong
and good.'
Mr Asher was speaking as Hongkong Bank published the formal documents
stating the full terms for its bid for Midland Bank. Midland's shareholders
have until June 30 to decide on the offer, which would create a combined
banking group with assets of Pounds 144.6bn.
The document, mailed to Midland's shareholders, values the bid at Pounds
3.4bn and 410p for each Midland share - well above Midland's closing price
in London last night of 390p.
The proposed Lloyds offer values Midland's shares at 453p.
Hongkong Bank said the merger would make an additional contribution to
profits of more than Pounds 800m in the first four years and Pounds 300m a
year by 1996 for the combined banking group.
Mr Asher revealed that Hongkong Bank would make cuts in Midland's
1,900-strong branch network and in the bank's treasury operations, but
declined to give any details of possible job losses.
However, around half of the Pounds 800m in extra profits which Hongkong Bank
hopes to make would come from an expected increase in the income of the two
banks after the merger.
On the other hand Lloyds expects to make Pounds 700m of cost savings
following a takeover of Midland.
Mr Asher admitted that there was relatively little duplication between the
existing operations of Midland, a mainly UK-based bank, and Hongkong
Shanghai, a global bank with its main oper-ations in the Asia Pacific
region.
He said that Midland would benefit from the introduction of Hongkong Bank's
branch administration and banking technology.
Hongkong Bank and Midland have been co-operating in computer technology for
nearly five years and it is expected that it would be relatively easy to
unify their systems.
Lloyds Bank immediately attacked the Hongkong Bank offer documents saying
that, unlike its own offer, they did not promise to create a major new
banking group in the UK which could compete vigorously with Barclays and
National Westminster.
'Lloyds Bank's proposal would deliver a wider product range and cost savings
which will enable substantial improvements in customers services and greater
competition in the UK,' Lloyds said in a written statement.
Lloyds also emphasised that uncertainties about Hong Kong's economic and
political future after the territory returns to China in 1997 made its
prospects extremely uncertain.
It is believed to have written to the Office of Fair Trading this week
warning that the fundamental issue at stake in the Hongkong Bank merger
proposals concerned the possible risk to Midland Bank if things went
seriously wrong in Hong Kong after 1997.

ASB GROUP, the recruitment and training company rescued from liquidation by
a Pounds 750,000 rights issue last year, yesterday announced an offer and
placing to raise funds to buy two training businesses, writes Peggy
Hollinger.
Mr Alan Greenough, chairman and chief executive, said the purchase of Harper
Craven, the sales and marketing training company, and Monckerkin, the
outward bound-type course specialist, would provide a solid base for future
expansion. The group will pay up to Pounds 700,000 for the two groups.
The company - which also announced increased losses for 1991 of Pounds
575,000, against Pounds 409,000 - is raising Pounds 200,000 through an open
offer of one share for every 7.56 held at 6.5p and a further Pounds 200,000
through a placing, subject to clawback.

PITTENCRIEF, the rapidly-growing communications and natural resource group,
is stepping up its presence in the US mobile phone sector, in anticipation
of a demerger of oil and gas assets next year.
The group yesterday announced a Pounds 10m two-for-seven rights issue to
fund the purchase of five US communications businesses and future investment
in telecoms and natural resources.
The shares rose 12p on the news to 239p, a 26 per cent premium on the offer
price of 190p.
Mr Terry Heneaghan, chief executive, said the five south western-based
purchases would increase Pittencrief's telecoms sales by 50 per cent.
This would bring it into the top five US Specialised Mobile Radio Controlled
communications groups.
The acquisitions, which total Dollars 8.4m, are Comtronix, Advanced
Communications Systems, A-Com Communication, Mustang Communications and J&amp;J
Systems.

FT  09 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Initial agreement for WPP refinancing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARY MEAD, Marketing Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PROPOSALS for WPP's anticipated financial reconstruction, which could
cut its Dollars 1bn (Pounds 550m) bank debt by as much as 25 per cent, have
been agreed with the co-ordinating committee of its 28-bank syndicate.
They will now be presented to the international marketing services group's
syndicate of banks for full approval. WPP had been facing serious cash-flow
problems which threatened to come to a head in June.
The co-ordinating committee - Bankers' Trust, Barclays, Citibank and JP
Morgan - are backing a plan whereby the syndicate would subscribe for a
rights issue of 230m low yielding convertible preference shares. The
proceeds would be used to reduce bank borrowings.
Each new preference share would be subscribed for at between 60p and 75p,
depending on market conditions, and would be convertible into one ordinary
share. The banks would subscribe in proportion to their holding of debt.
Existing shareholders - there are 213m preference shares and 60m ordinary
shares in issue - would be offered clawback arrangements.
Holders of existing preference shares would be able to convert into ordinary
shares at a ratio of 0.588, equivalent to some four times the existing
conversion terms. During the last four months the market prices of the two
shares has resulted in an average conversion ratio of 0.46.
Bankers close to the negotiations said yesterday they regarded the proposals
as offering a better deal to existing shareholders than a straight
equity-for-debt exchange.
The dilution of WPP shares by the rights issue, combined with the clawback
arrangements, means that the syndicate banks could end up holding a little
more than 50 per cent of WPP capital stock. That would give the banks a much
closer identification with WPP.
The proposals are being seen by some involved in the negotiations as marking
the co-ordinating committee's determination to stay with WPP in the hope of
long-term growth in the advertising sector.
If approved by the syndicate, the proposals will be put to shareholders for
their agreement. No timetable has been fixed, but if all goes smoothly the
new financing plan could be in place by the end of June.
The proposals announcement made no mention of the future position of Mr
Martin Sorrell, WPP's chief executive.
There had been speculation that some banks had been seeking his removal
prior to any financial reconstruction. But yesterday one banker described
the suggestions as scurrilous gossip, adding that there was total support
for Mr Sorrell in his current role.

FT  09 MAY 92 / Letter: Mistaken prescription for BT prices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From J B K RICKFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Mr Matson, the chairman of National TeleCable, argues (Letters, May 6)
that BT should reduce its prices but would not do so until forced by
competition. In fact, since 1984 we have, under rules agreed with Oftel,
reduced prices by more than 25 per cent on average, in real terms, for our
main services. Last year, for example, we cut international call charges by
10 per cent. Oftel's current RPI-6.25 per cent price cap will require real
and nominal price cuts again this year.
Mr Matson describes as 'beguiling but fallacious' our argument that
competition should operate freely in the telecommunications market without
rules designed to favour one player at the expense of another. His proposal
appears to be for BT to make a one-off price reduction and then to freeze
its prices regardless of economics until it has lost a substantial share of
'the relevant market' - perhaps the sector in which cable businesses
currently operate with statutory TV monopolies.
Mr Matson would apparently like the government regulator to serve him a
share of the telecommunication market on a plate. That is not competition.
His prescription for achieving that result is also mistaken. BT's prices
overall are no higher than necessary to cover our cost of capital at the
market rate. If we are required to reduce them, Mr Matson and our other
competitors will have to face a level of BT prices which is less than
economic. Compelling BT to charge less than is sufficient to cover our cost
of capital will prevent competitors from establishing themselves.
So Mr Matson does not offer convincing arguments for changing the policy of
open competition to which the government is committed. J B K Rickford,

FT  09 MAY 92 / Reforms that err on the safe side: The UK pensions industry
accepts the need for change - with reservations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The ghost of Robert Maxwell looms large over the UK pensions industry. At
the annual conference of the industry's trade association in Glasgow last
week, its members spoke frequently of the shockwaves caused by the
disapperance of more than Pounds 400m from pension funds he controlled. They
are steeling themselves for a radical overhaul of pension laws now seen as
inevitable.
Some members of the National Association of Pension Funds believe that
change is desirable. 'There is a general recognition that reform is
inevitable,' said Mr Brian McMahon, Napf chairman and group benefits
director at BET, the industrial conglomerate.
But among many delegates the desire for reform is more cosmetic than real.
While Napf leaders are calling for the industry to co-operate in drafting
new laws, scheme administrators are hoping that existing laws can merely be
adjusted. They are seeking an overall structure which will reassure
employees of the safety of their pensions while doing little to change the
day-to-day operations of the funds.
'There is a danger that mistakes will be made,' said Mr David Morgan,
pensions manager at Nestle Rowntree, who describes himself as an advocate of
reform. 'If you improve the existing system by manipulating the edges, you
have fewer chances of getting it wrong.'
The spectre of Mr Maxwell, delegates said, has injected a new sense of
urgency into an industry which has consistently rejected calls for reform.
The spotlight has made some of its members uncomforable.  Several delegates
expressed shock at seeing their habitually clubby annual conference
displayed on national television news programmes.
Mr McMahon said the industry is clearly taking itself more seriously. Unlike
previous years, for instance, the presentation of technical papers has been
heavily attended by delegates. 'Ordinarily, these sessions are the ones
people use to go out and get a cup of coffee,' he said.
The sea change has been prompted by mounting public anxiety over the safety
of pension fund assets. 'I think that MPs were universally shocked at how
easily Robert Maxwell got away with it,' said Mr Stewart Ritchie, pensions
director at Scottish Equitable. 'Now that change is inevitable, the
challenge for the industry is to be constructive. Over the past 10 to 15
years, this industry has refused to realise that change is necessary.'
Since Mr Maxwell went overboard from his yacht, the safety of pension funds
has climbed rapidly up the political agenda.
A cross-party parliamentary select committee on social security, which held
hearings into the Maxwell affair, has suggested wide-ranging changes to
pension laws, including the scrapping of trust law, which governs pension
schemes. The committee has asked for a top-level committee of inquiry to be
set up to study the matter further. Its formation is expected to be
announced shortly by the Department of Social Security.
The appropriateness of trust law as the governing force behind pension
schemes is a central issue that the committee will scrutinise. Trust law was
developed in the Middle Ages to help manage the assets of knights on
crusades. Under it, the administration of pension funds is left to the
trustees who often represent the companies which sponsor the schemes.
Mr McMahon has listed three main areas likely to be the focus of
legislation:
Who should control pension schemes? Should pension fund boards be required
to balance representation between employer and member representatives?
What safeguards should be introduced to protect assets? Beyond selecting a
competent investment manager, what steps should trustees be required to take
to protect their holdings?
Should there be a compensation scheme for members and, if so, what sort of
mimimum standards should funds have to meet to participate?
In addition, Mr McMahon said, MPs may also have to come to grips with the
thorny question of just who owns pension fund surpluses. While he expressed
confidence in the industry's acceptance of reform, it is clear that there
will be firm resistance from some quarters.
'I need reform like a hole in the head,' said the pensions manager of a
leading UK company. While, as a practical matter, reform may not require
great changes in the way his fund is administered, the expense of conforming
to new regulations may raise costs substantially, he said.
Mr David Trevor, pensions manager for Grand Metropolitan, the food, drinks
and leisure group, said proposals for new pension laws, particularly if they
restrict employers' access to scheme surpluses, could result in a
curtailment of benefits for members.
He said companies which have traditionally assured workers that they will
receive pensions of up to two-thirds of their final salary will no longer be
able to give that guarantee. Instead, companies may simply designate a lump
sum that each worker will receive on retirement and then leave it to the
worker to invest the money to provide an annual income.
In the US the shift to such so-called money-purchase schemes has been blamed
on a raft of pensions protection legislation, which companies say has priced
final salary plans out of their reach.
But to many Napf members this week, such threats by companies are little
more than posturing. Companies fund pension schemes generously because high
marginal tax rates make it advantageous for them to do so, said Mr John
Cunliffe, a pensions lawyer and partner at McKenna &amp; Company. In addition, a
company which does not offer competitive benefits cannot attract and retain
qualified employees.
That view was echoed by several delegates who act as consultants to the
pensions industry. Mr Alan Jenkinson, policy director at the consulting
actuaries Noble Lowndes, described talk of cutting contributions as
'propaganda'. However, he said reform could hasten the shift of UK schemes
to money-purchase plans.
A further contentious issue is the creation of a nationwide compensation
fund for pension scheme members who are the victims of failed pension plans.
While there is widespread support for such a scheme, some delegates were
concerned that well-run schemes will be forced to bail out badly managed
ones. Mr Steven Mingle, partner at actuaries Bacon &amp; Woodrow, said it would
be difficult to extend compensation arrangements to schemes with
insufficient assets to cover all liabilities were the scheme to be wound up.
At the heart of the conference the industry was grappling with what sort of
law is needed to reassure pension fund members that their funds are safe,
without making them prohibitively expensive for employers to operate. No law
has yet been proposed but for the first time there has been a broad
recognition of the need for a new framework. The aim is to prevent a scandal
on the scale of Maxwell happening again.

FT  09 MAY 92 / Getting up from the canvas: A recovery in the market for
contemporary art
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Christie's sale of contemporary art in New York on Tuesday evening was a
tense affair. The market had been in free fall for almost three years. The
value of even major works by well respected artists had virtually halved.
Yet Christie's was offering an important composition by Andy Warhol, '210
Coca-Cola Bottles', a painting depicting seven rows of bottles stencilled on
to a silkscreen, with a hefty estimate of up to Dollars 2.8m.
Warhol's prices have fluctuated markedly since his death in 1987. And
although its early date, 1962, made the work important, the general feeling
was that Christie's, and the vendor, Martin Blinder, whose recession-hit
company sells art in shopping malls, had over-reached themselves.
In the event, bidding was brisk, with four potential buyers. The work was
finally sold to the Zurich dealer Thomas Ammann for Dollars 2m, well below
estimates but still a weighty price for Warhol, whose long-term reputation
is far from established. Christie's gamble had paid off and the market for
contemporary art, the most fickle sector of the arts trade, had given clear
signs of recovery.
'I am more than fairly pleased,' said Christie's expert Diane Upright after
the New York sale. Along with her rival Lucy Mitchell-Innes at Sotheby's she
had succeeded during the week in re-establishing a solidly based market in
contemporary art.
Prices may be considerably reduced on 1990 levels but at least there were
buyers, mainly American and European private collectors, for the select lots
which had been allowed to appear at the rostrum.
By concentrating on paintings that had not been on offer for many years,
that were in good condition and carrying low reserves, Christie's managed to
sell 82 per cent by value of its 67 lots for a total of Dollars 11.26m.
Sotheby's received Dollars 12.3m from 56 lots, and sold 76 per cent of its
works.
Both salerooms were lucky as well as bold. They each had an important seller
keen to dispose of desirable paintings at low prices. Sotheby's were
marketing a series of works owned by Charles Saatchi, co-founder of Saatchi
&amp; Saatchi, the advertising group, and the dominant force in the contemporary
art market for over a decade. He is currently jettisoning important works by
artists he helped to popularise in the early 1980s so as to acquire the art
of a later generation as well as the occasional modern masterpiece. Saatchi
can afford to accept low prices since he bought the works for very modest
sums.
His imprimatur ensured that 'Bob's World', an early 'plate' composition (in
which broken plates are stuck to the canvas to create a greater physical
impact) by the controversial Julian Schnabel, sold for Dollars 319,000.
Other Saatchi paintings to sell included one of Cy Twombly's many 'Untitled'
canvases, bought by Saatchi's dealer Larry Gagosian for Dollars 1.65m, and
Dollars 627,000 for a pastiche of the Old Master Vermeer by the British
artist Malcolm Morley.
This was an auction record for Morley and underlined the growing
internationalism in the market for contemporary art. Traditionally,
Americans bought the abstract expressionism of the post-war New York
artists; Germans the work of their painters like Baselitz, Kiefer, and
Richter; and the French stuck with the Paris School. Now artists can cross
borders much more easily. Significantly, this week's sales brought the first
purchases from Taiwan, although the Japanese dealers, who entered this
market at its 1989 peak, were conspicuously absent.
Christie's sale centred on the works of Frederik Roos, the Swedish financier
who established his collection during the 1980's and who bought widely from
artists of various nationalities.
Roos died last year, aged 40 and loaded with debt, and Christie's has the
challenge of disposing of his collection. It has the advantage of
negotiating with a deceased estate, which helped it force low estimates and
reserves on the art. But even so, Christie's was amazed at its success in
marketing 188 of the best Roos acquisitions.
Virtually all were sold, for a total of Dollars 7.8m. Work by English
sculptors patronised by Roos, such as Tony Cragg and Barry Flanagan, sold
for auction record prices - Dollars 99,000 for a Cragg composition of three
giant bronze canisters, and Dollars 93,500 for a Flanagan bronze of one hare
balancing another on its nose.
Internationalism is not completely established - Sotheby's failed to sell
Saatchi's important nude portrait by Lucian Freud, 'Night Interior',
probably because the estimate of Dollars 500,000 was excessive for an artist
not well known in the US - but it is the best hope for the market's future.
For contemporary art still faces problems. There was very little buying this
week by dealers, who are sitting on enormous bank overdrafts in unvisited
galleries with vaults full of over-priced pictures.
And the main reason that the auctions were successful was that Sotheby's and
Christie's had fixed reserves even lower than those at last November's
auctions.
The market is in convalescence and is still far from buoyant. It was
noticeable that neither owners nor auction houses were willing to risk the
great icons of modern art - works by Jasper Johns or Jackson Pollock, de
Kooning or Lichtenstein, were not on offer this week.
Diane Upright reckons that the top price that anyone is currently prepared
to pay for a painting by a modern master is Dollars 10m. Three years ago a
de Kooning, 'Interchange', sold for Dollars 20.678m to a Japanese buyer and
a Jasper Johns, 'False Start', changed hands for Dollars 17m.
As the international economy moves out of recession, dealers and collectors
expect that the contemporary art market should continue to recover from its
sickbed. In any event, it will not lose its ability to shock.
The artist in keenest demand, whose prices have continued to rise during the
recession, is Robert Gober. His speciality is making creations of urinals,
beds, and, in particular, kitchen sinks. One of his beds, composed of
enamel, wood, cotton and wool, soared above its estimate on Tuesday to make
a record Dollars 180,000 - but also to create new doubts about the aesthetic
value of contemporary art.

FT  09 MAY 92 / Leading Article: Chill winds in bi-polar west
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
HISTORY, far from being over, remains an instructive, though potentially
misleading guide to the future, be it of nations, politicians, or stocks and
shares. Last week's riots in Los Angeles, a product of America's past,
suggest the US version of liberal capitalism possesses serious flaws; while
Germany's unexpected descent into division indicates the difficulty of
creating a new nation after the unexpected unification. But such
history-making events will also determine more mundane futures: the careers
of politicians, such as Mr Bush and Mr Kohl, and the returns for small
investors.
Whether or not the US and Germany eventually converge on the same capitalist
model, the short-term economic prospects for the west's two largest
countries look very different. In the US, it now seems that a sustainable
economic recovery is under way; with the nation nervous and the election
coming, the Federal Reserve will do everything it can to ensure there is no
triple-dip. But Germany looks to be edging nearer to recession. This would
spell danger for politicians and investors across Europe, since the
Bundesbank and the government, whether by omission or commission, now
determine short-term prospects across the continent.
Wall Street certainly believes the US recovery is under way. The market's
price-earnings ratio remains high by historical standards; and in real terms
the market is fast approaching its peak last reached before the 1987 crash.
Yesterday's news provide grounds for optimism: non-farm employment rose by
almost twice as much as expected, and the unemployment rate fell to 7.2 per
cent.
Yet suspicion remains that Wall Street is running ahead of itself. This
modest improvement in hiring prospects, and other indicators in the
manufacturing, retailing and housing sectors, suggest only a modest
recovery, by past standards. That the US stock market faltered yesterday,
once the employment data signalled that another interest rate cut was
unlikely, suggests that low returns on cash, rather than expectations of a
profits surge, are supporting equities.
Higher inflation
Neither low US interest rates, nor the current US bull market, will last
forever. The recent rise in bond yields suggests more cautious investors are
already nervous about inflation. The US remains, as always, a country for
which growth now is more important than the risk of higher inflation later.
Yet historical valuations, while relevant for the US, are more dangerous
when applied to the UK equity market. Britain, too, has tended to be a
growth-seeking society. But hitching sterling, and therefore the UK
inflation rate, to the world's most inflation-wary country - Germany -
implies a very different future.
The UK's stock market culture appears unconvinced about the costs of
Britain's new regime. The FT-SE has risen by more than 13 per cent since the
UK general election, reaching a new nominal high this week. Students of the
past suggest the UK market rally has further to go: equity yields are still
low compared to bond yields, while, in real terms, share prices are low
compared to the peaks of 1989 and 1987.
Pallid recovery
But whence will these expected future profits come? The economic recovery
looks, at best, pallid; last week's interest rate cut, while welcome, leave
short-term real interest at chokingly high levels; and the ERM leaves little
room for further easing.
The European interest rate floor now looks set to remain about 10 per cent
into 1993: the Bundesbank's determination to keep its head, while all around
are losing theirs, will see to that. The German government's capitulation in
the face of a comparatively civilised strike confirms its weakness. The
engineering employers are unlikely to be so malleable in the face of
similarly high union demands, but IG Metall will test their mettle.
A further German interest rate rise looks as likely as not. It would provide
a test of whether Germany has been knocked from pole position within the
ERM. If France proves able to hold this week's modest cut, the answer may be
yes - temporarily. But recent history does not bode well: the last French
bid for leadership ended miserably last autumn. The luxury of wide bands
gives the UK a better chance; but three-month interest rates are already
discounting a rise in UK rates.
The deeper question, which will certainly not be on the official agenda at
this weekend's meeting of EC finance ministers, is whether the ERM, at least
in its current hardened form, would survive a rise in German rates. This
seems a strange moment for Sweden to be trying to join. Some kind and
battle-weary finance minister should take the Swedes aside.
A less rigid ERM would also test whether Mr Major's government does mark a
real change in Britain's post-war economic history. If low and stable
inflation is to be Britain's future, then an independent and reconstituted
Bank of England would be the best signal of his resolve. If not, then search
out those historical yield ratios. The UK could yet revert to type.

FT  09 MAY 92 / Time runs out for Councillor Sproggins: Alison Smith
explains how the reduced role of local politicians is likely to be further
diminished
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COUNCILLORS elected this week are likely to find that their job descriptions
have altered dramatically by the time they ask the voters to renew their
contracts in four years.
Councillors who now see themselves as full-time providers may by then have
become part-time enablers.
Labour's local election campaign was marked by doom-laden warnings about the
downgrading of local authorities under threat from central government. The
move away from the council as centre of the local universe, as envisaged by
the Tories, was summed up by one Conservative who said: 'The days of
Councillor Sproggins House or Councillor Bloggins Way are over.'
The parties are united, however, in emphasising the continuing importance of
local government. Both Mr John Redwood, the local government minister, and
Mr Bryan Gould, the shadow environment secretary, describe councils as a
vital element in the UK's plural democracy.
Officials at the environment department believe that the present ministerial
team has a less minimalist view of the constitutional role of local councils
than Mr Michael Heseltine, the former environment secretary.
This belief in councils' constitutional role may bring little comfort to
councillors conscious that both the main parties have seen a declining
variety of candidates as one of the main pressures for change.
If Labour had been in power this point would have been addressed by giving
authorities a wider role and by making some posts salaried.
Mr Gould said: 'I believe that being a councillor should be a full-time
occupation for some people, not a hobby people indulge in during the
evenings.'
Under the present government the response is to try to cut down the
commitment.
The role of local authorities will continue to shrink, partly through more
schools becoming grant-maintained - though councils will be taking on
responsibility for community care - partly through tightening government
controls on local spending, and partly through further challenges to
automatic provision of services.
In spite of these trends Mr Redwood can still point to the discretion
councils have in the provision of some services and can highlight how
planning decisions give them 'enormous power over the private-sector life of
this country'.
His argument that detailed government intervention in the delivery of some
local services through setting procedures for compulsory competitive
tendering (CCT) merely amounts to 'suggesting ways in which things could be
better managed' is, however, likely to be greeted with a hollow laugh in
town halls.
This is particularly so as government intervention through CCT is to be
extended, with introduction into housing mangement a priority.
Sir George Young, the housing minister, speaks of councils developing a more
challenging and important role once they hand over the management of their
housing stock. Mr Redwood believes that the council's role as a provider of
services can inhibit its ability to take decisions, but will not prescribe a
separation of functions as a solution.
He said: 'If a council is a very dominant provider, it may be very
protective about other people coming in to provide a slightly different
style of service in a chosen area.
'It may well be with certain kinds of care provided in the community that if
the authority sees its prime task as enabling the care to be provided and
standing up for those who are going to enjoy the care, that they become even
tougher on standards - which would be a good thing. But I don't want to
overdo it . . . All I ask is that they get good value for money and think
about these issues.'
Alongside a strengthened role as enablers over the next four years,
councillors may find themselves giving more prominence to debating policy
and may also develop a role in scrutinising council efficiency, as the
cross-party Commons public accounts committee does for government
departments.
As ministers have found with local government before, however, a change in
the job description is more immediately accomplished than a widespread
change in those filling the posts, especially as it is the voters rather
than the government who make the appointments.

THE GRASS on the bank around the Nissan car factory's test track says it
all. 'Sunderland. Simply the Best,' it proclaims in red and white paint.
Throughout the city the municipal gardeners have been planting red and white
flowers in honour of its football team's appearance in today's FA Cup Final
against Liverpool. On the route the team will follow tomorrow on their
triumphal return - win or lose - the lampposts are decked with red and white
pompoms and bunting.
To an outsider all this may seem excessive. But for Sunderland, reaching the
final is the crowning achievement of a run of morale-boosting triumphs.
Earlier this year it achieved city status and this week its polytechnic
became a university.
Today Nissan is scrapping its Saturday morning overtime, and those shops
staying open expect hardly a customer.

FT  09 MAY 92 / National winner boasts record gains
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUTLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN NATIONAL terms the Conservatives were plainly the winners in Thursday's
vote - and winners on a scale that has eluded them in every set of local
elections since the late 1970s. They took a record share of the vote and
made a record number of gains. The results indicated a nationwide swing to
the Tories of more than 4 per cent.
Labour lost seats and votes on Thursday and should not blame the outcome on
their election-weary supporters. The turnout does not appear to have
declined as much as early reports suggested.
However, Labour still control many councils in safe Conservative Commons
constituencies. The Conservatives have a clear majority in only 28 of the
207 authorities that went to the polls, while Labour control 88 councils.
The Liberal Democrats control eight districts and 68 councils are hung, an
increase of nine. Power in most of those is shared between Labour and the
Liberal Democrats.
Granted that only a third of the seats were at stake in any council,
however, the Conservatives fared well in many areas. They won a majority of
the seats fought in Birmingham, Bradford, Brighton and Bristol, as well as
in Derby, Gloucester, Portsmouth, Stoke-on-Trent, Walsall and Wolverhampton.
The Liberal Democrats held all of their strongholds and gained a scattering
of seats compared with 1988, when this year's crop were last contested.
But in 1988 the centre parties were descending into their post-Owen abyss.
This year they plainly hoped for better things, and their disappointment is
that they did not benefit from the expected return to the fold of those
supporters who a month ago deserted them lest Paddy Ashdown proved the
Trojan horse for a Labour government.
The normal by-election swing against the government, so often manifest in
the annual local contests, was missing. Since April 9, of course, the
Liberal Democrats have had no publicity while Labour's headlines have
plainly been counter-productive. The government has basked in the afterglow
of its un-expected victory, and this week its popularity was reinforced by
buoyant economic forecasts and a cut in base rates.
There was no strong regional pattern to the results, although Labour's worst
results seem to have been in the Midlands. Nottingham and Leicester, where
the party polled exceptionally well in the general election last month, did
not council elections on Thursday.
Scotland had been expected to produce the most interesting results but in
the event provided little excitement. Labour advanced in Aberdeen but fell
back in Edinburgh and lost four seats in Glasgow.
The SNP gained 30 seats, but failed to add to the one council they control
or to attain significant bridgeheads. The Conservatives remain very much a
minority party north of the border but, as in the general election, a small
movement has increased their authority to resist the pressures for radical
constitutional change. For the rest of Britain, it is hard to read any great
and lasting expression of national will into these votes.

FT  09 MAY 92 / Dewhurst to shed up to 1,500 jobs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARY MEAD, Marketing Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DEWHURST, which runs the UK's biggest chain of butchers shops, confirmed
yesterday that it is to close up to 600 of its 1,006 high-street outlets in
the next 18 months, with the loss of up to 1,500 jobs.
Dewhurst is a subsidiary of Union International, which handles the food
businesses of privately-owned Vestey.
The Vestey group was recently forced to make substantial provisions on its
property portfolio, and some observers regard the decision to slim the
Dewhurst chain as partly a response to that. Union International and Vestey
declined to comment yesterday.
Mr Mike Carter, marketing manager of Dewhurst, said the company planned to
sell some of the shops as going concerns and that others would be taken over
by current managers.
Mr Carter was unable to put a market value on the sale. He added that
Dewhurst would review the situation during the next 18 months and, should
business recover, the company might dispose of fewer than the planned 600
units.
The company has no plans to introduce franchise arrangements for the shops
involved, and does not intend to close en bloc in any particular part of the
UK.
Dewhurst has been hit by factors including the spread of Sunday trading, the
growing strength of large supermarket chains and the recession. According to
Verdict, a retail research company, the large grocery chains now account for
more than half of all carcass meat and 92 per cent of all bacon, ham,
poultry and meat products sold in the UK.
Mr Carter denied that a growing tendency towards vegetarianism had reduced
Dewhurst's market.

FT  09 MAY 92 / Wandsworth row over opt-outs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WANDSWORTH council, the Conservatives' flagship borough in south-west
London, looks set to resist attempts by its remaining comprehensive schools
to opt out of its control in order to avoid the reintroduction of selection.
Mr Edward Lister, chairman of Wandsworth's education committee, said he was
'strenuously opposed' to the borough's secondary schools opting out as a way
of remaining unreformed comprehensives. Although this was a personal view,
he said he was 'confident' it would be the borough's response to any opt-out
applications.
Applications by schools for grant-maintained status do not require
local-authority consent, but if applications were opposed by Wandsworth they
would be embarrassing test cases of the government's commitment to
opting-out.
Education ministers have repeatedly claimed that opting-out is intended to
foster freedom and responsibility for school governors, irrespective of
arguments for and against selection.
Apart from two church schools, only four comprehensives, one of which is to
become a selective city technology college, remain under Wandsworth's direct
control. Three other comprehensives have already opted out with the
borough's blessing.
Mr Lister, who is favourite to succeed Sir Paul Beresford as leader of the
council, is determined that the council's three remaining comprehensives
adopt subject or vocational specialisms along with tests and interviews to
select pupils.
Mr Lister said: 'We must oppose those three schools opting out of council
control. It would not improve choice. But if those schools become selective
and provide choice and variety then I will happily support grant-maintained
status thereafter.'
Governors at the three schools are currently considering making opt-out
applications. Mr John O'Malley, chairman of governors at Chestnut Grove
School, Balham, said he and others were 'upset and seriously concerned' at
the council's plans.

FT  09 MAY 92 / BCCI auditor scorns fraud claim
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRICE WATERHOUSE, auditor to the collapsed Bank of Credit and Commerce
International, yesterday dismissed as 'outrageous' an accusation of fraud
made on behalf of two Omani depositors with the bank.
Zaiwalla &amp; Co, a London-based firm of solicitors representing the
depositors, is applying to the High Court for leave to amend its statement
of claim alleging negligence so that it also includes deceit in relation to
the Price Waterhouse auditing of the BCCI accounts.
Price Waterhouse said last night: 'These charges are absolutely outrageous
and have no grounds at all. We have never been fraudulent. If this ever
comes to trial we have no doubt we can defend ourselves.'
The request is due to be considered before a High Court judge on June 2 at
the same time as Price Waterhouse argues that the entire action should be
dismissed.
It is brought on behalf of Mohammed Khasruzzaman and Rabha Khasruzzaman, who
say they deposited Dollars 600,000 in BCCI in London after relying on the
1989 audited accounts of BCCI Holdings (Luxembourg).
The news comes a week after Judge Consuelo Marshall in the central district
of California court dismissed a class-action suit filed by US and other BCCI
depositors against 77 defendants including Price Waterhouse.
Mr Graham Stacy, the Price Waterhouse partner co-ordinating the firm's BCCI
team, said: 'We are grateful to the US court that we can draw breath. This
is a fair result.'
However, Mr Bill Lerach, lead counsel to the plaintiffs and a partner with
law firm Milberg Weiss, said yesterday he would be acting early next week to
'vacate' the judge's opinion.
If that action fails, the plaintiffs will appeal to the ninth circuit court
of appeals in San Francisco. That could take up to 18 months, but they will
request a rapid hearing.

CIVIL engineering companies are more optimistic about work prospects than at

According to the Federation of Civil Engineering Contractors, which surveyed
more than 150 construction companies, more are predicting a rise in orders
over the next 12 months than are expecting a fall. This is the first time
there has been more optimism than pessimism about orders since April 1990,
the federation said.

FT  09 MAY 92 / Anti-Tory alliance to be proposed: Ashdown wants Labour to
join opposition 'forums' - Gould rejects pact but speaks of 'common ground'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR PADDY ASHDOWN, Liberal Democrat leader, will today propose policy
'forums' - which would include Labour representatives - to develop an
anti-Tory political agenda.
He will try to capitalise on Labour gloom after Thursday's council elections
by arguing that the party's leaders can no longer claim to speak for all
non-Conservatives.
Mr Bryan Gould, shadow environment secretary and a candidate for the Labour
leadership, dismissed a pact with the Liberal Democrats but said he favoured
'building common ground' with other parties to prove the Tories were in a
minority on many issues.
Mr Ashdown said Labour must ask whether its role of challenging the Tories
had been replaced with a new role - 'to lie across the tracks like a
roadblock to any other force that is capable of removing the Conservatives'.
His speech today will stop well short of calling for election pacts, which
would have little support in his party. But he will suggest 'forums' drawing
members from a range of organisations and starting with electoral reform.
He hopes to stimulate debate on the realignment of the opposition parties.
But his proposals are unlikely to receive much attention from Labour
leadership candidates who want to lead any moves towards mechanisms for
building anti-Tory alliances.
Labour moved to quell suggestions that its poor performance in Thursday's
local elections had ushered in a period of one-party politics, as the
Conservatives achieved their best council result for 15 years.
Mr Jack Cunningham, Labour's campaigns co-ordinator, conceded that the loss
of more than 360 seats was disappointing. He said, however, that Labour
remained 'the dominant party of local government' with about 9,100
councillors compared with about 8,400 for the Tories.
In spite of a Conservative party estimate that the turnout was a 'perfectly
respectable' 43 per cent, Mr Cunningham said the lower number of voters in
Labour strongholds meant 'it is misplaced to read any long-term trends or
conclusions' from the results. 'What happened on April 9 was something
altogether on a very different scale,' he said.
Mr Gould said it was 'premature and faintly ridiculous to begin a discussion
on whether we have now entered a one-party state.' Later he set equality of
women and a less 'macho' image for politics as a theme of his leadership
bid.
Mr Chris Patten, Tory party chairman, described the local election results
as 'spectacular'. He said: 'They are the best results for the Conservative
party for 15 years and the best results for any governing party for a
generation.' They again showed only the Conservatives could be trusted to
provide high-quality services at the best price.
His ebullience was recognised by Mr Ashdown, who acknowledged Liberal
Democrats had been wrong to expect guilt-stricken Tory voters at the general
election to switch support in the local elections.
Mr Ashdown said, however, that the Liberal Democrats had been able to make
'steady progress', even in the face of rising Conservative support.
He said the Liberal Democrat share of the vote was about 19 per cent, 3
percentage points higher than in 1988. Labour claimed about 32 per cent
compared with about 45 per cent for the Tories.

FT  09 MAY 92 / CPSA leaders back pay offer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MORE than 11,000 Civil Service clerks will receive rises of about 11 per
cent if they follow the CPSA union's recommendation to accept the
government's shake-up of Whitehall pay.
The basic offer, worth 4.75 per cent on the pay bill for 175,000 staff,
would mean that for the first time civil servants would not receive
automatic annual rises for long service. Rises above the cost of living
would depend on performance.
Under existing Civil Service pay rules the settlement must be at least 4.5
per cent this year. The offer means all clerks would receive a 4.25 per cent
cost-of-living award from April 1 this year. About 6,000 staff on the main
clerical grade would get 5.45 per cent. They currently earn Pounds 9,983 and
would earn Pounds 10,527 under the proposed deal.
The offer also extends the scope for government departments and agencies to
opt out of centralised pay bargaining. It lays down a procedure for pay and
grading to opted-out departments and agencies. Under the procedure unions
must be consulted at national level.
The moderate CPSA union, which represents junior civil servants, is
recommending members to accept the offer. A Militant-supporting group within
the union will urge members to reject it.
Last week leaders of the NUCPS union, which represents middle-ranking civil
servants, said it would recommend members to reject a similar offer worth
4.5 per cent on the pay bill.
The Union of Communication Workers is recommending 12,500 Post Office
counter and clerical staff to accept an offer from management of a 4.25 per
cent increase in basic pay backdated to April 1.
The offer is worth a net 4 per cent because some allowances are not being
increased this year.

FT  09 MAY 92 / Hurd urges caution in EC: Premature transfer of more power
to Brussels will be resisted
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH determination to resist premature moves to confer more authority on
the institutions of the European Community was underlined in the Commons
yesterday by Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary.
In a dismissive reference to reports that Mr Jacques Delors, president of
the European Commission, had already drawn up proposals for a supranational
executive in Brussels, he said they had not been made known to the British
government or considered by the commission itself.
Mr Hurd, speaking in the resumed debate on the Queen's speech, said there
was no case for changing the timetable agreed at the Maastricht summit,
which provided for further discussions about the com-munity's institutions
in 1996.
He said smooth progress towards EC enlargement through the entry of Austria,
Sweden and Finland should be a priority for Britain's presidency of the EC,
starting on July 1.
Mr Hurd hoped Britain's presidency would prepare the way for negotiations to
be concluded with the three applicant countries next year so that, after the
necessary ratification procedures in 1994, they could become EC members in
1995.
He acknowledged that their arrival would require changes in the number of
commissioners, the voting rights of the council of ministers, and membership
of the European parliament. Mr Hurd insisted: 'I can see no advantage
whatever in having a sort of permanent negotiation on the institutions of
the community'.
He envisaged that by 1996 consideration would be given to a second wave of
new entrants to the EC, possibly including Czechoslovakia, Hungary and
Poland.
The foreign secretary said the EC had enough on its plate without arguing
about its institutions. He urged it to concentrate on solving pressing
financial and trading problems and completing the single market.
Mr Hurd also called on Libya's Colonel Muammer Gadaffi to draw a 'clear,
certain, permanent line under the history of his support for terrorism'. If
the two Libyan officials named in the warrants issued in connection with the
Pan Am aircraft destroyed over Lockerbie were handed over to the Scottish or
US authorities the position would be 'transformed'. Mr Hurd gave an
assurance that they would not be subject to any interrogation while awaiting
trial in Scotland and confirmed they would have the right to remain silent
throughout the proceedings.
Mr Gerald Kaufman, shadow foreign secretary, again pressed for more aid to
be provided for the republics of the former Soviet Union. He warned of the
risk of turmoil in the republics worse than that now occurring in the former
Yugoslav republics.

FT  09 MAY 92 / Business phone lines may use grid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NATIONAL Grid Company plans to use the electricity network of England and
Wales to supply large companies with an alternative telephone network.
The company, which owns and operates the electricity grid in England and
Wales, said yesterday it would set up a subsidiary called Telecom Electric
to develop this business.
National Grid is the latest company to apply for a telecommunications
licence, following the government's decision last year to open the market to
competition. Until then BT, the UK's largest telecommunications group, and
Mercury Communications, its smaller rival, had exclusive rights to provide
basic telephone services. Telecom Electric would lay telecommunication
cables alongside its existing electricity cables, but does not have any
plans to supply domestic consumers.
'We are only looking at a particular sector of the market,' National Grid
stressed. 'We would supply major organisations that already have their own
networks, for example between their different sites.'
The company said the project was quite distinct from its earlier plans, in
conjunction with the regional electricity companies of England and Wales, to
invest about Pounds 400m in a complete telecommunications network.
'That was a year ago; this is much smaller,' the company said.
Last month the two Scottish electricity companies became the first in the
sector to apply for telecommunications licences.
Earlier this month Yorkshire Electric, a supply company, took a minority
stake in Ionica, a private group which has been awarded a licence to provide
a telecommunications service using radio links.
Two other utilities, British Rail and British Waterways, have also applied
for licences.

<TEXT>
President F W de Klerk yesterday ordered a Supreme Court judge to reopen
inquiries into the 1985 killing of a leading black activist after a
newspaper alleged that a South African security agency was involved in the
assassination.
In the latest, and potentially most serious allegation about the existence
of a government-directed hit squad, a Johannesburg newspaper yesterday
linked the army intelligence chief with one of South Africa's most notorious
political killings. It published what it claimed was an authentic document
proposing the killing of Mr Matthew Goniwe and two other anti-apartheid
leaders, dated June 7, 1985.
The shot and mutilated bodies of Mr Goniwe and four colleagues, including
the two named in the army intelligence document, purportedly sent to the
State Security Council, (the highest state security body) were discovered
two weeks later. The document is allegedly signed by Brigadier (now General)
CP van der Westhuizen, now South Africa's military intelligence chief of
staff.
Mr de Klerk yesterday denied that any murder was ever ordered by the cabinet
or the State Security Council, an inner cabinet which wielded massive power
under former president P W Botha.
If the newspaper can prove its claims, government will have to explain the
current role of Gen van der Westhuizen. It would reinforce allegations the
Government runs a 'dirty tricks' department, a pro-apartheid 'third force'
within the security services.
ANC president Nelson Mandela commented: 'People who were responsible for
ordering the killing of a brilliant leader of the people are still in the
army, probably in higher positions today.'
There has been a string of unsolved assassinations of ANC officials in
recent months.

TV-AM, the commercial breakfast television broadcaster, agreed in the High

Five TV is seeking injunctions to prevent TV-am, with which it discussed

of City TV in Toronto.
TV-am is negotiating to form a consortium, The Entertainment Channel, with

Telegraph group.
Five TV took its legal action on the grounds that it understood it had
reached a confidentiality and exclusivity agreement with TV-am which would
have led to them making a joint bid for Channel 5.

FT  09 MAY 92 / MI5 to lead intelligence operations against IRA
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN and JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INTELLIGENCE operations to uncover IRA units operating on the British
mainland are to be led by MI5, the security service, instead of the Special
Branch of the Metropolitan Police, Mr Kenneth Clarke, the home secretary,
announced yesterday.
He told the Commons that 'political change' - a Whitehall phrase for the
less active role being played by the agents of the former Soviet Union and
its satellites - had made it possible for MI5 to devote more resources to
countering IRA terrorism in mainland Britain.
The move had been widely expected after the leak just before the general
election of a report proposing the change by Mr Ian Burns, a senior Home
Office official with experience of Northern Ireland.
Mr Barry Sheerman, a Labour spokesman on home affairs, yesterday expressed
concern about the lack of effective parliamentary scrutiny of MI5 and called
for the establishment of a select committee of privy councillors to oversee
all the intelligence agencies.
Mr Antony Scrivener QC, the former chairman of the Bar Council who has wide
experience of terrorism cases, said MI5 agents had a reputation for
withholding documentation and refusing to give public evidence in court.
In practice MI5 has for several years been working behind the scenes in
anti-terrorism intelligence-gathering both on the mainland and in Northern
Ireland, in co-operation with the police and Army intelligence.
Yesterday's announcement drew an unprecedented if still uninformative public
comment from the head of MI5, Ms Stella Rimington. She said in a statement:
'We look forward to strengthening still further our already close
co-operation with the police service and combining our skills even more
effectively with theirs to help them bring terrorists to justice.'
Mr Clarke said yesterday that the change did not imply any reduction in the
activities of special branch forces in the UK or in the resources available
to them to fight terrorism.
Responding to questions in the Commons he underlined the scope for the
expertise of MI5 operatives in detecting the membership of Provisional IRA
cells, their plans, intentions and movements.
Mr Clarke emphasised that the police would continue to be responsible for
the collection of evidence and the arrest and prosecution of those suspected
of terrorist offences. 'There need be no conflict between intelligence
gathering and operations,' he declared.
Some legal experts predicted that by seeking to give MI5 greater public
prominence the government could be paving the way to greater friction
between the security services and the police.
The general expectation in the security services is that Mr George
Churchill-Coleman, the commander of the Metropolitan Police anti-terrorist
branch, will retire before the end of this year or early next year.
The Association of Chief Police Officers said yesterday it welcomed Mr
Clarke's announcement, although some senior police officers are understood
to have been privately opposed to MI5 taking a bigger role in the detection
of terrorism.

FT  09 MAY 92 / Settlement agreed on swaps
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND HUGHES, Law Courts Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CHEMICAL BANK confirmed yesterday that it had settled its Pounds 2.94m claim
against Hammersmith and Fulham council in London. The action was part of the
interest-rates swaps litigation, and the terms were not disclosed.
Solicitors Linklaters and Paines, for the bank, said it would proceed with
its claims against other councils arising from the Lords' ruling in January
last year that swaps deals entered into by local authorities were void as
they were outside their legal powers.
Three of Chemical Bank's claims - against the councils in Richmond, London,
Welwyn Hatfield in Hertfordshire and Sandwell, West Midlands - involve
similar facts to those in its case against Hammersmith and Fulham. Chemical
Bank's claim against Hammersmith and Fulham was the fifth of the six lead
cases in the swaps litigation - selected in the hope of obtaining guidelines
from the court - to be settled out of court.
The hearing of the sixth case, NationsBank of North Carolina against
Hammersmith and Fulham, started in the High Court on Thursday and will
continue on Tuesday.
Yesterday, after hearing an application by Morgan Grenfell, the merchant
bank, for its claims against Welwyn Hatfield and South Tyneside council to
be made lead actions, Mr Justice Hirst said any parties wishing their cases
to become lead actions could apply to the court on June 8.

FT  09 MAY 92 / Thai police halt march on king's palace: Security forces
block protest by tens of thousands demanding removal of prime minister

THIRTY thousand sit-down protesters confronted riot police in the Thai
capital of Bangkok early today after the country's unelected prime minister
defied their demands to quit.
Facing the country's most serious unrest in twenty years General Suchinda
Kraprayoon, went on television to insist that he was the country's
legitimate leader.
But well over 100,000 people poured onto the streets to try to force the
general, who led a military coup which toppled an elected government last
year, to resign. The protesters want the prime minister to be chosen from
the ranks of elected lawmakers. Gen Suchinda does not hold a parliamentary
seat.
Thousands of the protesters led by opposition leader General Chamlong
Srimuang, the former governor of Bangkok who has been on hunger strike since
Monday, tried to march towards the Royal Plaza, scene of huge demonstrations
this week, but six ranks of riot police armed with clubs blocked their way.
Soldiers erected barricades and trucks armed with water cannon stood behind
the lines.
Gen Chamlong, weakening from the hunger strike he has vowed to maintain
until Gen Suchinda quits, appealed from the back of a truck for calm. The
protesters sat down and started singing.
'If you want to kill the people, you kill me, the first person,' he told
police at the barricades.
A strict Buddhist, Gen Chamlong is immensely popular in Thailand and is
considered to have great integrity. If he were hurt or killed, it could
trigger serious riots. His march yesterday towards the royal palace to
appeal to Thailand's king to intervene seemed to be designed to bring the
month-long crisis to a head.
During the day there had been speculation that Gen Suchinda, appointed prime
minister without standing in last month's election, might resign. The
rumours contributed to a 20-point rally on the stock market. But when he
appeared on television in the evening he defended his decision to accept the
premiership saying that a neutral leader was needed to hold together the
five-party government coalition.
He argued that it was 'universal' democratic practice for the prime minister
to be a person supported by a majority in parliament.
The prime minister pledged that the military and police would not use
violence to suppress the demonstration unless infiltrators caused sabotage
and violence.
Protesters say last year's coup was part of a plan to instal the dominant
group of officers in full political control.

FT  09 MAY 92 / Rump Yugoslavia dismisses 38 generals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURA SILBER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BELGRADE
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE RUMP Yugoslav presidency yesterday purged the top ranks of the military
establishment in a move which gives Mr Slobodan Milosevic, the president of
Serbia, full control over the army. It also marks the final transformation
of the Yugoslav forces into a Serbian army.
The dismissal of 38 ex-communist generals and several admirals follows a
two-month smear campaign in the state-run Serbian media of the army's
performance in the war with Croatia and its failure to quash the republic's
independence.
The dismissals include General Blagoje Adzic, the acting defense minister,
who 'officially resigned'. He has been replaced - as chief of staff - by
General Zivota Panic. The defence ministry will be filled by a civilian.
Tanjug, the Belgrade-based news agency, also reported the sacking of Gen
Milutin Kukanjac, commander of the federal army forces in Bosnia, whose
headquarters is in Sarajevo.
The sackings allow middle-ranking, and younger Serb officers to run the
army. These officers have little in common with their communist Yugoslav
superiors whom they accuse of conducting a 'soft' campaign in Slovenia and
Croatia after both republics declared independence in June.
The purging of top army ranks will pave the way for the withdrawal of the
Yugoslav federal army from Sarajevo, and those regions of Bosnia not
controlled by Serb irregulars. The revamped Yugoslav federation, consisting
of Serbia and its close ally Montenegro, have ordered its citizens who are
soldiers, to withdraw from Bosnia. But diplomats yesterday said this was
cosmetic because it leaves behind 40,000 Bosnian Serbs and all the army
material.
The purge coincides with renewed clashes in Sarajevo, the capital of
Bosnia-Hercegovina, and an agreement between Serb and Croat leaders to carve
up the newly independent republic.
The European Community yesterday denounced the plan which, besides leaving
Bosnia's 2m Moslems without a homeland, undermines any attempts by the
international community, and the UN to broker a peace in Bosnia.
Radio Sarajevo reported fighting between Serb irregulars and Bosnian
territorial defense in several regions of the capital. At least 500 people
have been killed and over 450,000 forced to flee.
Mr Marrack Goulding, the UN undersecretary, on a mission to assess the
feasibility of deploying a peacekeeping force to Bosnia, condemned 'the
indiscriminate and random shelling of civilian targets.'

FT  09 MAY 92 / Albania and UK resolve war disputes
</HEADLINE>

   By ROBERT GRAHAM

<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ONE of the last major diplomatic and legal disputes arising out of the
Second World War was resolved yesterday at the British embassy in Rome.
At a low-key ceremony, Albanian and British officials agreed to bury all
outstanding differences caused by the 'Corfu Channel incident', when, in
1946, two British destroyers struck Albanian-laid mines while exercising
their rights passing through the Corfu Channel.
One destroyer was sunk with the loss of 44 lives. The other was holed and
had to be scuttled. In retaliation Britain broke off diplomatic relations
and withheld gold claimed by Albania. The gold had been seized by the Nazis
in their occupation of Europe and was found by the allies at the end of the
war in caves in southern Germany. It was impounded and subsequently
administered by a tripartite commission of Britain, France and the US being
used to settle numerous state and private post-war claims.
Britain took the Corfu Channel incident to the International Court of
Justice at the Hague which ruled in 1948 that the Albanian government pay
Pounds 843,947 compensation. The communist government in Tirana never
recognised the decision and with the isolationism of the regime of Enver
Hoxha a dialogue was impossible. The first tentative contacts began only
seven years ago.
Yesterday's agreement involved Britain undertaking to hand over some 1,574kg
of gold to Albania as the latter's share held by Britain in the tripartite
commission. In return, Britain will receive Dollars 2m (Pounds 1.1m) from
Albania in settlement of all outstanding claims.
It is doubtful whether any money or gold will change hands. Britain accepted
the impossibility of Albania paying the accumulated value of the court
judgment, and the democratically-elected government of President Sali
Berisha refrained from pressing for payment of the current value of the
gold. Britain established diplomatic relations last year but the agreement
smoothes the way for increased bilateral assistance from the UK. The
agreement requires formal approval from France and the US.

FT  09 MAY 92 / An overture to the main event: German public-sector returns
to work as engineering and metal workers prepare to down tools
</HEADLINE>

SOME accounts were easily calculated and quickly settled. 'I'm going to take
the rise, tear up my card and quit the union. That way I'll be DM38 (Pounds
12.90) a month better off,' a dispassionate Dusseldorf bus driver declared.
'All that hassle for absolutely nothing,' concluded a colleague, back at the
controls of his tram for the first time in 11 days.
The only consensus was that the public purse will have to yield up a further
DM16bn to pay for the settlement this year, and that the loss of production
and sales attributable to the disruption of post, transport, telephones and
other services will cost a further DM1bn.
There is as yet no accounting for the loss of confidence among union
members, the loss of jobs, proclaimed as inevitable by learned economists,
the loss of face in Chancellor Kohl's government and, not least, the loss of
patience.
While the machinery of the public sector rolled back into service as quickly
and smoothly as it had been brought to a standstill, tempers frayed for the
first time. 'We Germans don't like striking. We like to work. But we don't
like doing either for nothing,' said a Bonn postal worker, unhappy at being
asked to work overtime to clear the backlog.
The mood was further undermined by the mounting certainty that the events of
the last two weeks were nothing more than an overture to the main event: a
strike in the engineering and metal-working industry. Few people had clear
recollections of the last public sector strike, 18 years ago, and for most
there was a certain novelty about the latest stoppage.
Bicycles were hauled out of cellars, taxis ran impromptu, meticulously
scheduled 'bus' services, normally dour drivers gave lifts to the bikeless.
In Hamburg earlier this week, at the high point of the strike, dustmen
turned out voluntarily to clean up the Reeperbahn 'entertainment' quarter
because they did not want tourists to leave with the wrong impression of
Germany.
But few have forgotten the last engineers' strike, remembered as the hardest
and bitterest post-war campaign. At its peak, the union called out a mere
58,000 workers. Management responded by locking out a further 160,000 and
laying-off 450,000 without wages or strike pay. At one stage the country's
entire car industry was paralysed.
The issue then was shorter working hours. The issue now is pay. This week's
public sector deal provided the first component of a complex and difficult
equation. The headline pay increase of 5.4 per cent for workers who, in the
words of IG Metall leader, Mr Franz Steinkuhler 'produce nothing' will not
be nearly enough for the 4m people operating the machines which generate
most of Germany's wealth.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NUCLEAR FORCES of the former Soviet Union will remain under joint
Commonwealth control for the time being despite Russia's decision to form
its own military forces, Gen Pavel Grachev, acting Russian defence minister,
said yesterday.
He spelt out plans for dismantling the Red Army at a ceremony to commemorate
the anniversary of its finest hour - the defeat of Nazi Germany 47 years ago
today.
Gen Grachev, appointed on Thursday when President Boris Yeltsin ordered the
creation of a Russian army, said Russia was counting 2.63m of the former
Soviet Union's 3.7m-strong armed forces as its own, including some stationed
in other republics.
However, Russia aimed to cut numbers to 1.5m by 1996 to create an army that
was 'powerful, mobile ..manageable and professional'. It planned to set up
rapid deployment forces and would take its general staff from that of the
former Red Army.
However, this did not mean the immediate disappearance of the Commonwealth
joint command, which would remain in place until all strategic weapons were
withdrawn from Belarus and Ukraine. Gen Grachev suggested Russia might have
to negotiate a separate treaty with Kazakhstan, the other republic with
nuclear arms on its territory, or find a means of prolonging some kind of
Commonwealth control over these weapons.
Belarus and Ukraine have committed themselves to becoming non-nuclear weapon
states, but Kazakhstan has insisted on keeping its options open.

FT  09 MAY 92 / UK government plans property deal to aid O&amp;Y
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON and BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE UK government and Olympia &amp; York are at an advanced stage in talks on a
multi-million-pound property deal which would help rescue the troubled
developer.
The deal would involve the government taking 500,000 square feet of space at
O&amp;Y's Canary Wharf development in East London, in return for a commitment
from the company that it will make its Pounds 400m contribution to the costs
of extending the capital's Jubilee underground line.
Talks between Toronto-based O&amp;Y and the government were already taking place
before the company ran into financial difficulties two months ago with debts
of Dollars 12bn.
However, Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, has accelerated
the negotiations in the hope that they will help to stabilise the company's
financial position.
Meanwhile, in a move to reassure its creditors, O&amp;Y disclosed yesterday that
it had placed shares pledged as collateral on a Dollars 2.5bn 'jumbo' loan
in the custody of a Canadian bank. The shares represent O&amp;Y's 82 per cent
interest in Abitibi-Price, the newsprint producer, and its 75 per cent stake
in Gulf Canada Resources, an oil and gas producer.
O&amp;Y said the move was to give creditors 'a level of confidence'.
A deal with the government on the space at Canary Wharf, Europe's biggest
property development, is unlikely to be finalised for a few weeks. But
sources close to the talks said that the Department of Trade and Industry
under Mr Heseltine and the Department of Environment, his previous
department, were both expected to take space.
Under the proposal thousands of civil servants would move to London's
Docklands, though ministers would remain in Whitehall and Westminster.
If the deal is clinched, that should help O&amp;Y to refinance individual Canary
Wharf buildings, which in turn would provide it with the funds for its
contribution to extending the Jubilee line into London's Docklands.
The 11 lenders to the Pounds 3bn Canary Wharf project yesterday agreed to
provide O&amp;Y with Pounds 21m of new borrowings to meet its expenses for the
rest of May. The money was provided only after extreme pressure was put on
Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, which was threatening to put the
Docklands project into administration under UK insolvency procedures by
withholding its share of the new money.
In a series of meetings with its 15 principal bank creditors over the past
two days, O&amp;Y has outlined its five-year financing requirements. It wants a
Pounds 300m revolving credit facility to complete phases one and two of
Canary Wharf.
However, the Canary Wharf banks said yesterday they were unhappy that a
substantial portion of this Pounds 300m was being raised for the sole
purpose of allowing O&amp;Y to pay them the interest they are owed. They say
they would rather have O&amp;Y shares in place of cash interest, which is what
the parent company's banks have been offered.
The Canary Wharf lenders are, however, being offered shares in Canary Wharf
itself. But one banker said yesterday that 'at the moment these are worth
nothing'.
On the other hand, the parent company bank group, which is owed Dollars 4bn
and is being offered O&amp;Y 'B' class non-voting shares, yesterday complained
about the absence of voting rights on these shares.
The main element in this Dollars 4bn is the Dollars 2.5bn 'jumbo' loan. O&amp;Y
has shocked the providers of this jumbo loan by telling them that its cash
flow over the coming five years will only cover between 40 and 50 per cent
of the interest due on the loan. So the lenders may have to receive the
remainder in the form of shares.
Banks in general said that the latest refinancing proposals from O&amp;Y,
presented on Thursday, were a big improvement on what was offered three
weeks ago and could serve as the basis for further negotiations.

FT  09 MAY 92 / BT plans to reward its smooth operators
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BT STAFF who whistle while they work could find themselves the proud
recipients of a Pierre Cardin simulated pearl necklace or a Sony Walkman,
under a management scheme to lift the workforce's low spirits.
The scheme is being introduced as BT cuts 24,000 jobs.
Managers who feel a particular employee is 'living BT's values' will be able
to nominate the individual for a gift to be chosen from a catalogue of 50
items.
The Union of Communication Workers, which represents BT telephone operators,
reacted angrily. 'This is yet another cynical attempt to manipulate the
workforce,' said Ms Janice Stone, a UCW national official.
Operators have been particularly badly hit by the job cuts. A recent
internal survey found that 44 per cent of the 216,000-strong workforce were
afraid of losing their jobs. Only a third of those who took part in the
survey were proud of the company.
BT, which says it expects to award thousands of the gifts, claims the scheme
is a first as it is not an incentive scheme but a reward to staff who
implement company values.
As an illustration, BT says an installation engineer who alerted a customer
to a 'hitherto undiscovered problem with their telephone' and whistled while
he fixed it might be eligible for an award if a customer wrote in to say
what a 'marvellous advertisement' he was for BT.
The UCW is sceptical about how motivated staff will be by the gifts: 'It may
be a forlorn hope for BT that giving away trinkets can turn this appalling
loss of morale around. Pictures in the brochures of smiling workers
applauding a colleague being thanked by a manager are hardly likely to ring
many bells with UCW members at BT.'

FT  09 MAY 92 / Hanson sells its stake in ICI
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HANSON, the Anglo-American conglomerate, yesterday cleared the way for its
next big acquisition by officially ending its phoney war with Imperial
Chemical Industries when it sold its 2.8 per cent stake in the UK company.
While there was no official comment from ICI except to say that it would
continue to work on its cost improvement programme, one of its advisers
described the sale as the final admission of defeat by the conglomerate.
Hanson made a profit from its ICI shareholding of about Pounds 28m.
It is understood that Hanson would like to make a big agreed deal by the end
of the year. The conglomerate, one of the UK's most acquisitive companies,
has not launched a hostile bid since 1986.
Mr David Clarke, deputy chairman of Hanson Industries in the US, said: 'We
are, of course, looking at acquiring another core business and will do so at
some time.'
He noted that Hanson's share price had risen because of strong US buying,
and added: 'US investors are not waiting for another mega deal but are
delighted with the running of our core businesses.'
Since Hanson raided the market in May 1991 to take a 2.8 per cent stake in
ICI, a full bid had been expected for the pharmaceuticals group, which waged
an effective propaganda war against the conglomerate.
In response to criticism of its corporate governance and lack of an obvious
successor to Lords Hanson and White, respectively chairman and head of the
group's US arm, the group last year appointed three new non-executive
directors. It recently made Mr Derek Bonham group chief executive and
appointed Mr Clarke to his position in the US.
A financier close to Hanson said the group lost interest in developing its
relationship with ICI after it became clear that the pharmaceuticals company
would not contemplate either a merger or any joint ventures with Hanson.
The conglomerate decided to sell its ICI stake after it received the final
dividend late last month as part of its programme to eliminate net debt,
which had risen to Pounds 1.5bn following the acquisition of Beazer, the
aggregates and housebuilding company.
'Hanson has never been happy with net borrowings,' said one of its advisers.
'The sale of its ICI stake is part of the group's tidying up exercise before
it makes its next big deal.'
Goldman Sachs, the US investment bank which advised ICI in its dealings with
Hanson, yesterday confirmed that it had bought Hanson's 20m ICI shares for
Pounds 280m.
Hanson, which bought the shares for Pounds 11.94, received Pounds 14.00 a
share after Goldman placed about half the stake for around Pounds 14.10 to
US investors.
The profit on the holding was after carrying costs and minus ICI's dividend.
The group had to pay three top financial advisers, N M Rothschild, Lazard
Brothers and Cazenove, although one of Hanson's advisers said the total cost
of the advisers for the year was not expected to exceed Pounds 1m.

FT  09 MAY 92 / Germany braced for private sector strikes: Minister says he
was 'stabbed in back' by employers over pay deal

GERMANY is bracing itself for more strikes next week as bitter
recriminations soured the air of relief yesterday over the end of the
country's worst public sector strike since the war.
In an extraordinary outburst, the federal minister in charge of negotiations
said he had been 'stabbed in the back' by state employers who negotiated the
end of the 11-day national strike among the country's 3m public sector
workers.
Mr Rudolf Seiters, interior minister, who led the the employers negotiating
team, claimed the Social Democrat employers had undermined his position as
he entered the crucial closing round of pay talks on Thursday which led to a
5.4 per cent offer. 'I find it hard to accept this award and have agreed
with a heavy heart.'
He was furious about last-minute interventions by SPD leaders who had called
publicly for payment of the full arbitration award.
His comments came as engineering employers in the private sector were
bracing themselves for official strikes among their 4m workers.
'I think it will come to a strike,' said Mr Gerhard Cromme, chairman of the
Krupp steel and engineering group.
While claiming that private sector employers were increasingly prepared for
stoppages, he seemed uncertain about the extent to which they could hold
down wages.
As Mr Cromme warned of falling sales and profits, and 'pruning' in his
company, about 120,000 metalworkers continued 'warning strikes'. Their
union, IG Metall, is due to hold a board meeting on Tuesday to plan the next
stages of its campaign for a 9.5 per cent pay rise. The employers have so
far refused to improve their 3.3 per cent offer.
The headline figure of 5.4 per cent for public services is now widely viewed
as the starting point for a settlement, although many public service union
members, ordered back to work overnight, described their award - a mixture
of one-off payments and a 5.4 per cent increase in basic pay - as a
'sell-out'.
Mr Seiters said the overall award amounted to 5.12 per cent. The total extra
cost of DM16bn (Pounds 5.4bn) - DM2.3bn from the federal budget, DM4.6bn
payable by local councils and the balance shared between state governments,
post and railway authorities - was DM480m less than the price of the 5.4 per
cent award proposed by arbitrators.
The oTV union claimed the deal was worth 5.7 per cent.

FT  09 MAY 92 / Pound and shares up on recovery hopes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH and JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARE prices and sterling continued to rise yesterday, as investors
registered optimism about economic recovery in the UK.
The FT-SE 100 index of leading shares finished at 2,725.7, up 23.8, to reach
a record close for the third day running. The pound edged up half a pfennig
to DM2.945, its highest close in London against the D-Mark for nine months.
In New York it finished at DM2.9404.
Sentiment about an upturn was helped by this week's half-percentage point
cut in UK base rates to 10 per cent, together with a sharp rise in new car
sales.
Both shares and the pound have benefited from buying pressure from
international investors, especially from Japan and Germany, who appear to be
taking a sanguine view of UK growth prospects.
The 66-point advance in the FT-SE 100 index during the week has been
especially helped by sterling's continued rise within the 10-currency
European exchange rate mech-anism.
Starting the week above only the Danish krone, sterling has leapfrogged the
lira, the French franc and the punt in the past few days. It is now only
slightly weaker than the D-Mark, the central currency in the system.
Mr Richard Kersley, an equity strategist at Barclays de Zoete Wedd, the
London investment bank, said the mood of optimism had been fired by the
perception that sterling's strength could give the Treasury room to cut UK
borrowing rates still further in the next few months.
But he warned against over-optimism. 'People may have become more confident,
but so far we have seen very little hard evidence about the pace of any
recovery.'

FT  09 MAY 92 / How To Spend It: Zooming in on a bargain - Glyn Genin, the
FT's picture editor, focuses on cameras
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GLYN GENIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FROM LATE last century, when most photographs were taken on glass plates,
with cameras built of brass, leather and mahogany, designers sought to
utilise 35mm film, made for the cinema, to make picture-taking more compact.
Oscar Barnuck's brilliant Leica prototype of 1913 was the forerunner of a
classic range against which 'miniature' cameras are judged, even today. The
grainy, slow, soot and whitewash emulsions made for the the silent screen
were less than complimentary to Barnuck's uncompromising engineering,
though. Processing and enlarging was also pretty primitive, and it was more
than 10 years before Ernst Leitz had enough confidence in the film stock
available, produced chiefly by Eastman Kodak and Agfa, to begin
manufacturing the Leica I in any quantity at their Wetzlar factory.
German manufacturers dominated the market for 35mm and rollfilm cameras
between the wars, with Leica, Contax, and Rolleiflex the last word in
mechanical and optical excellence. But they were far from cheap.
When Zeiss Ikon launched the Contax in 1932 it retailed for about the cost
of a family car. A few were exported to Japan where they sold for the cost
of a small family house.
It was certainly an enduring design, the Tokyo-built Nikon S2 of 1954 is a
faithful replica of the 1936 vintage Contax II. Nikon, together with other
Japanese manufacturers, Canon, Pentax, and Mamiya among them, now dominate
the camera market. Ironically, the modern Contax is now made in Japan.
Amateur photographers now use much more 35mm film than the motion picture
industry, for which it was designed - some 75m colour negative films, Pounds
280m worth this year in the UK alone.
Quality cameras no longer need be super-expensive. Excellent no-nonsense
point-and-shoot compacts are available for as little as Pounds 100, and
bulkier, interchangeable lens SLR (single lens reflex) cameras for even
less. Here are a few of the better buys:
KONICA BIG MINI (Pounds 100). Robust, lightweight, no nonsense compact.
SIGMA ZOOM SUPER-70 (Pounds 140). Impressive feature-laden specification in
less than compact body. Borrows passive autofocus technology from pricier
SLR's. A real bargain.
NIKON TW ZOOM (Pounds 160). Neat, compact, versatile, with the pin sharp
optics you would expect from Nikon.
SAMSUNG AF ZOOM (Pounds 190). Korean import, lots of features in a sleek
body.
KONICA AIBORG (Pounds 210). Do not let the Star Wars appearance put you off
 -won the Amateur Photographer Zoom Camera of the Year Award for 1992.
CONTAX T2 (Pounds 500). If you have Pounds 500 to spend, forget the others.
Beautifully engineered, with pin-sharp Zeiss lens.
PENTAX K1000 (Pounds 160 with 55mm lens). Old-fashioned, but rugged no
nonsense SLR.
MINOLTA X-300 (Pounds 210 with 28-70mm zoom lens). Simple to use SLR.
CANON EOS 1000FN (Pounds 300 with 35-80mm zoom lens). SLR with built-in
flash. Quiet and light.
NIKON F-801S (Pounds 590 with 50mm lens). Most of the features of the
'professional' Nikon F4 - for a lot less than half the price.
Prices are a guide only; consult the weekly Amateur Photographer or the
monthly Practical Photographer and What Camera? for the latest and best
prices. Dealers and manufacturers have occasional special promotions.
Buy a Nikon compact camera before the end of August, for example, and you
can get a family ticket to EuroDisney and up to three nights accomodation in
Paris - not a bad way to start using the camera.

ANYONE WITH a garden, however small, or a conservatory which could do with a
revamp, should visit Holloways or send for the brochure.
Holloways is a family-run business run from a converted oast house in the
village of Suckley, near Malvern in Worcestershire, specialising in
conservatory interiors and antique garden ornaments. The oast house is
filled with everything the proper conservatory could possibly need - from
Lloyd Loom to Rattan, from cane to wrought-iron as well as lots of smaller
things such as Regency-style plant-holders and bird baths.
Possibly the most enchanting section is the outside courtyard which is
filled with an eclectic collection of finds gleaned from country houses and
auctions all over the UK. You could come upon an ancient stone trough or
cider mill, a stone bench, a sundial, an urn or figurine. It is a splendid
place to search for a special present - a friend found an antique Georgian
sundial which made a wonderful birthday present for his wife.
Holloways is at Lower Court, Suckley, Worcestershire WR6 5DE. Tel:
0886-884665.
The company will send a set of free brochures to potential customers and is
happy to discuss by telephone the sort of one-off antiques that they have in
stock, or to search for something particular that you might have in mind.

Made from plastic with a strong aluminium frame, it is easy to clean and
robust as well as light. It could go happily to pool or polo, to riverside
or point-to-point, to Badminton or Glyndebourne. It weighs 21 lb, pulls out
to measure 33 1/2 in by 26 in and it comes in blue, green, red or yellow. It
can only be bought by post and costs Pounds 69 from Huzar Co, PO Box 12,

<TEXT>
I SUPPOSE that there are a few people left with dividends, bonuses or pay
rises to celebrate, and what could be a more convivial birthday or
anniversary present than a splendidly sybaritic hamper?
Alfred Dunhill, currently investigating its archive material in order to
recreate the luxury products of yesteryear, has come up with a picnic case
(photgraphed below) for which only champagne and the grandest of foods will
do.
At Pounds 2,995 this is not, you understand, the sort of hamper from which
you unwrap a cheese sandwich and a can of beer - mais non, it requires a
full fete champetre to fulfil its ambitions. It is, you will have gathered,
the sort of picnic hamper that takes a bit of living up to.
The Pic-Nic, the soubriquet by which Alfred Dunhill likes it to be known, is
kitted out in regal style - Waterford cut crystal glasses, Wedgwood
porcelain, proper cutlery in a leather-covered canteen, leather-covered
flasks and Irish linen napkins, not to mention some very refined touches
that the posh picnicking classes seem to go in for, such as napkin rings and
coasters.
The hamper as a whole when closed resembles nothing so much as a very smart
leather-clad briefcase. For the moment it is only available at Alfred
Dunhill, 30 Duke Street, St. James's, London SW1Y 6DL.

FT  09 MAY 92 / Hawks &amp; Handsaws: A real con artist
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIGEL SPIVEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
I CANNOT claim to have been one of the late Francis Bacon's champagne
claque. But I have a nice vision of the artist from someone who was.
The setting of this vignette is not the Colony Rooms in London's Soho, but a
Chinese restaurant in the Clerkenwell Road; and Bacon is ensconced not so
much with his arty retinue as with an elite of London mobsters. I am told he
got along very well with such criminals, and competed eagerly with them when
it came to paying the bill for Chinese meals. He was, as he told them,
enormously rich. 'Yeah,' snarled one. 'And you can't even draw a bloody
dawg]'
In fact, Francis Bacon may well have had difficulty in drawing a dog: he
never claimed to be a realistc draughtsman. But this is not the point. In
the eyes of such company at least he seemed like one of them: an arch con
man, touching suckers for millions with his pictures and frittering the
proceeds as would any big-time felon, on champagne and casinos. It sets me
pondering about the rapport between art and criminality. Was Bacon alone in
bridging the gap?
The motive of playing tricks on the public has never been far away. Ancient
Greek artists liked to paint bunches of grapes so luscious that people would
try to grab them. They sculpted cows so motherly that young calves came up
to suckle the statues. This, if you think about it, is a kind of
fraudulence. Then there was that other Greek artist who, curious to study
expressions of pain, subjected his models to tortures of which the Kray
Brothers might have boasted.
Examples of real degeneracy among great artists readily come to mind.
Benvenuto Cellini was as proud of his record of GBH as his silverwork.
Caravaggio was a scallywag. Most of the works of Rodin and Augustus John are
the fruits of persistent sexual harassment; and as for Salvador Dali, his
confessed record of malefaction is too repellent to be quoted here. It is
enough to say that he was one of the most poisonous individuals this century
has so far produced.
There is a converse side to this. In Rome recently, I watched some
pickpockets in action: gypsy children, none of them more than nine or ten
years old. Their subject was a camera- and cash-laden caravanserai of
Japanese tourists; their treatment of it can only be described as virtuoso.
With a few deft strokes, they picked out essential details, exhibited
wonderfully sensitive handiwork, and lightened the load of human existence.
What more do we want from any artist? I felt like the fellow who came upon a
young Giotto, scratching icons on a rock while tending his father's sheep.
There was a genius in these gypsy children: they wanted a proper
apprenticeship, an academy, for the full flowering of their potential.
Connoisseurs of crime, of course, share much in common with the connoisseurs
of art. It was always the unsigned touches of mastery that intrigued
Sherlock Holmes: and his techniques for attribution were exactly the same as
those currently being used by a posse of Dutchmen bent on distinguishing
Rembrandts from not-Rembrandts.
Trawling page three of the Daily Telegraph for first-class examples of
modern mastery, I am regularly gratified to find that the aspirations to
virtuosity among criminals are abundant, and no signs whatever that the
English country house murder is in decline.
Of course, there are plenty of untutored types about - crass daubers and
desperadoes who know nothing of preliminary sketches, finishing touches, and
so on, but some real craftsmen are in evidence.
There are those who can capture every salient object of value in your house
within a matter of minutes. Others present convincing models of pension fund
managers; others create marvellous images of aristocratic lifestyles. Still
others work in the chiaroscuro world of back alleys, mixing unusual powders
for extraordinary leaps of the imagination; while others again prefer to
shock the public by their stubborn disregard for form and decorum.
To anyone who has lately been burgled or set upon, this will appear a
heartless conceit. And in truth, I see only one benefit from granting
artistic status to our criminals: it would be a renaissance for which the
government would be given credit.

FT  09 MAY 92 / The strange case of Dr Mitty: Dominic Lawson asks what it
takes to give a person an air of authority
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DOMINIC LAWSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DOCTOR Muhammed Saeed, 64, stands in the dock of Leeds Crown Court accused
of working illegally as a general practitioner for the past 30 years. The
prosecution alleges that the man had assumed the identity and qualifications
of a 73-year-old Doctor Muhammed Saeed, who qualified with a Batchelor of
Medicine and Surgery degree from the University of Punjab, Lahore, in 1949.
The younger Muhammed Saeed is alleged to have used a duplicate of this
certificate to register with the British General Medical Council in 1961.
Since then, young Saeed has run a surgery in Bradford, West Yorkshire, with
3,000 patients. The prosecution alleges that the man was 'bogus' and 'was
running a sub-standard surgery with sub-standard facilities with a low
regard for cleanliness . . . this man is ignorant of medicine and ignorant
of the breadth of medicine available and is capable of many prescribing
errors.'
Only time, and the jury at Leeds Crown Court, will tell whether young Saeed
is guilty or innocent of the charge of deception. It brings to my mind an
earlier and quite different case in which a man far younger even than young
Saeed successfully masqueraded as a surgeon in a National Health Service
hospital. He performed a number of minor operations successfully before he
was detected as a fantasist who had always dreamt of being a surgeon, a
dream nourished by a collection of Emergency Ward 10 videos.
The poor man was defrocked of his white coat, to end up at an institution in
the care of other men in white coats. Were they real doctors? - The coat is
essential to the trick.
On a more mundane level, I recall the antics of a parsimonious friend with a
large appetite who, living near a large hospital, would at lunchtime don a
white coat and walk into the hospital canteen. Naturally, the more often he
went, the less likely it was that he would be challenged.
But Mr Doctor Saeed has been practising 'real' medicine for over 30 years,
without raising suspicion. If, as the prosecution allege, he was not
genuine, then it is the greatest example of a successful placebo test in the
history of medicine, showing that it is not just fake pills that can cure or
treat a patient, but even a fake doctor and a fake surgery.
Nor would this be very surprising. All we require from a GP is a sense of
authority and the hope that he or she will send us to hospital if we are ill
and he has no idea why or with what. The sense of authority comes simply
from the fact that we believe the man actually is a doctor, and if young
Saeed happened to send rather more of his patients to hospital than is
normal, that would be no bad thing. The worst doctors are those who are not
aware of the limits to their own knowledge. The prosecution would claim that
young Saeed was only too well aware.
Paradoxically, the greater the position of authority, the more likely people
are to be fooled or convinced.
I recall a conversation with a political observer of some note in the early
days of the recent General Election campaign - when it was fashionable,
indeed obligatory, to rubbish the Prime Minister.
Major, said this disenchanted observer to me, was a Walter Mitty figure who
had, by some bizarre twist of fate, been propelled from obscurity into the
job of Prime Minister.
The pundit explained it was actually very easy to persuade people that one
really was the Prime Minister, prime ministerial even. One lives at the
right address, and was driven around in the right sort of car, with the
right sort of bodyguards. And one had all the resources of the Civil Service
at one's disposal, to give one a plausible prepared answer to any tricky
questions that might be put. Then the pundit tapped his nose. 'But now Mr
Major must do without his civil servants' - the equivalent of Dr Saeed's
nurse, perhaps 'and once he is all alone on the hustings, the electorate
will suddenly realise that he is not really the Prime Minister after all,
but just Walter Mitty.' Well, they didn't. Which, I suppose the
Labour-voting pundit would argue, shows that you can fool 41 per cent of the
people all the time.

FT  09 MAY 92 / Yes, chefs have feelings too: A restaurant critic's
comeuppance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS LANDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JUSTICE Frank Martin, a Dublin judge, this week awarded the maximum
damages allowed in an Irish Circuit Court, Pounds 15,000 plus costs, against
the Irish Times and its restaurant critic, Sandy O'Byrne, for her review of
the Olive restaurant in Sandycove, Co Dublin.
As a restaurateur turned critic this judgment, even though it sets no
precedent in British law, should have sent professional shivers down my
spine. It did not.
Instead, I felt as though I had eaten a bad meal rather than read someone
else's account of one. Why, I asked myself, could the restaurateur not
accept the criticism? Why should the reviewer, if she were factually
inaccurate, not apologise and print a correction? And why was the legal
process involved at all to settle a matter of personal and highly subjective
opinion?
In its day my restaurant received both good and bad reviews, fortunately
more of the former. Only one, in the Evening Standard, shortly after we
opened, brought any noticeable increase in business. The other good reviews
did, however, have one significant effect - they were wonderful for staff
morale. Photocopied and pinned to every available wall in the kitchen and
staff changing room, they gave everyone a much-needed boost and allowed us
to deal calmly with the customers next day who demanded the impossible
immediately. I wish I could say we accepted the bad reviews with the same
equanimity. We swore, cursed, felt very hurt and tried to investigate what
had gone wrong. In one respect the hurt was understandable. Cooking is a
very personal process.
When I cook at home for friends and they leave anything on their plates  - I
try to be a generous host - I feel hurt. Chefs have the same feelings. They
do not like their hard work to be rejected but because they very rarely see
their customers they have no chance of gauging their customers' reaction
whether it is laudatory or critical.
But chefs and restaurateurs do share one great advantage. The most difficult
aspect for anyone to understand about the restaurant trade is that there is
no 'pending tray'. Everything happens so quickly - a busy dinner follows a
hectic lunch seemingly within minutes - and all customers have to be dealt
with so promptly that there is little time to sit and talk, let alone mope
over a bad review. Instead, there is the immediate possibility of putting
things right.
If, at lunch, the fish section was slow or the desserts not good enough,
customers can be compensated immediately with a free bottle of wine and the
organisational details can be rectified promptly.
A playwright, concert pianist or sculptor, whose productions may take years
to create, does not have this opportunity. When I asked the novelist Julian
Barnes how he reacted to a bad review he said that it would be inhuman not
to feel some gut reaction - letting down the tyres of the reviewer's car was
his immediately intuitive solution. But in his previous careers, studying
for the Bar and then writing literary and restaurant reviews, he had come to
the same conclusions as I have.
First, in matters of personal and critical opinion the law should never be
brought in except in extreme cases of damage or malice (ie allegations of a
lack of hygiene that may have caused food poisoning). This would rule out
restaurants suing critics for their highly subjective observations.
Second, restaurant reviewers, and their newspapers, should allow
restaurateurs and chefs the right of factual correction. Once that was
established reviewers might be forced to stick more closely to expressing
what they know rather than what they feel.
Such a system would also bridge the gulf between reviewers and their
readers. The most salutary aspect of the law suit in Ireland, and there have
been similar cases in Paris and Sydney where restaurant critics and their
papers have been successfully taken to court by restaurateurs, may be that
the general public stops taking any critic's word as gospel. Even the best
restaurants and the greatest chefs can have off nights and no restaurant
stays bad for ever - it usually goes out of business.
In almost four years as a restaurant critic three different chefs have
threatened me with legal action - one even phoned me at home at 8.45am on a
Saturday to complain about what I had written about him in that day's paper
 -but fortunately nothing materialised. What I dread far more is a letter of
complaint, or even the threat of legal action, from a reader who has
returned disappointed from a restaurant I have praised.
I sincerely hope it will never happen. If it should, I will carry on going
to restaurants because I feel that they do more than just serve food and
wine. When the novelist Paul Gallico was a sports journalist for the Daily
News in New York in the 1920s and early 1930s he wrote that he loved going
to sporting events - boxing, baseball or the races  - because all human life
was there. I feel the same way about restaurants and no judge,
over-sensitive restaurateur or prima donna chef is going to dampen my
enthusiasm for them.

FROM THE ruins of Armageddon came the sound of violins. The sound led to a
man and woman in their fifties who stood together in the shade of a
eucalyptus tree at the foot of the ancient city. They were reading from
dog-eared sheet music, duets by the late 18th century composer Ignace
Pleyel. Propped in front of them was a printed plastic sign 'New immigrants
from USSR' and a basket containing coins.
The couple said they had arrived from the Ukraine two years ago and this
genteel form of busking was the only employment they had found so far.
Israelis are fond of saying with a wry pride that they have enough Russian
immigrant violinists to fill their national symphony ten times over. But the
joke turns sour when in the centre of Jerusalem or Tel Aviv you can find
whole streets full of professional musicians scraping for a living.
About 350,000 Soviet Jews have landed in Israel since they were given
freedom to emigrate in 1989, a number which is equivalent to 7 per cent of
the country's population. The total was expected to rise to 1m by 1995 but
in the past year the monthly intake has halved and halved again. At the last
reported count, some 1,500 Russians had applied to go home again.
Russian unemployment has given rise to scandalous tales - of university
professors reduced to scavenging in dustbins, of doctors employed as
hodcarriers and women teachers resorting to prostitution - and to resentment
on both sides.
I went to the Soviet Jewry Centre in central Jerusalem to meet Alexander
Nathanson, a 50-year-old physics lecturer from Kuybyshev on the river Volga,
who has been in Israel for 15 months without a job.
The centre is one of 14 refuges in the city where Russians can go to keep
themselves occupied. This one specialises in the arts: chamber music, jazz,
drama, painting, and performances by 'the singing rabbi'. An Edith Piaf
album was playing in the coffee shop. Everybody smoked. A greybeard with a
profile to rival Rasputin's sat at the bar. A dark youth by the window
sighed over a letter from home. Somebody was practising the saxophone in a
nearby auditorium.
Nathanson is tall and very shy, with big hands and a slow smile. He talked,
through an interpreter, as if undergoing yet another bureaucratic
interrogation: self-effacing to the point of submissiveness, polite, alert
but careful to say nothing that might offend his host country.
I asked him whether he had felt victimised in Russia.
'In general it was difficult for a Jew to get to university, especially to a
physics faculty.'
Would you have got further if you were not a Jew?
'Possibly.'
In ordinary life, how did this discrimination show itself?
'I tried to get to the polytechnic and they didn't want to take me because I
was a Jew. They didn't sign the reference in the Communist party committee.
Only with that could you get to college.'
Nathanson went to the local school and to the University of Gorki to study
solid-state physics and eventually, after his two years in the Red Army,
became a lecturer at a technical college.
I asked him: although you suffered professional discrimination, were your
neighbours friendly?
'I had a very good relationship with all my colleagues at work. But I was
very surprised by something that happened some time before I came to Israel.
We were discussing a photograph in a magazine and one of my friends said to
another: 'Look, this man looks a bit like you]' The other answered: 'No he
doesn't. Why do you compare me with some Jew?' I was very depressed. I
didn't expect that reaction from him because he had been my friend for many
years.'
Was it because of anti-semitism that you decided to emigrate?
'It was one of the reasons. Besides, I was afraid for my children, for their
future. I didn't know what was going to happen to the country.'
Nathanson emigrated with his wife Alla, a piano teacher who is also looking
for work, and his daughters Inna, 21, and Elina, 15. I asked him if it was
his decision to leave, or his wife's.
'It was our joint decision. We thought a lot about it and then decided.'
In the Soviet Union did you feel Jewish or did you feel Russian?
'I was born in Russia and my native language was Russian. I was brought up
on Russian culture and literature. And of course I read the works of Russian
writers and I loved them. But I never forgot that I'm a Jew and I was also
aware of Jewish culture: I went to concerts of Jewish music and everything,
but I am not religious.'
Did you really want to go to America or some other country? Was Israel your
first choice?
'We came here at the time of the Gulf War and we stopped first of all in
Hungary where my wife tried to get us to some other country. But I wanted to
go to Israel and insisted.'
What is so special about Israel?
'We didn't have much choice. That is one of the reasons. Another important
reason is that it is our national motherland.'
What are your prospects of work?
'At the moment I am studying at the university, a special course for
teachers of physics and mathematics. I hope that after I've finished I'll be
able to find a job.'
There must be many others with similar qualifications. Won't it be a problem
finding work?
'Yes, I think it's a big problem at the moment. But I am also a member of
the organisation of Russian scientist immigrants who try to develop their
own ideas for commercial application. I hope we will manage but it's very
difficult. Perhaps I will find a job in this way.'
Have you done any kind of work for money here yet?
'Not yet. I've given some private lessons.'
Any building work or waitering?
'No.'
The Nathansons lives on 870 shekels (about Pounds 204) a month unemployment
benefit and what is left over from the so-called Absorption Basket, a
start-up loan which has to be repaid if the immigrant leaves Israel within
five years.
Do you find it depressing?
'Naturally I have spent a lot of time learning Hebrew. But I am not used to
being unemployed for such a long period.'
Did you know before you came how difficult life would be here?
'I did know, but I was hopeful.'
Housing is as much or more of a problem in Israel as it was in Russia.
Critics of the right-wing government accuse it of treating the Russian
immigrants as political pawns: using their presence to justify aggressive
settlement-building in the occupied West Bank instead of finding ways of
absorbing them in the home economy.
In Kuybyshev the Nathanson family had two large rooms. In their suburban
flat in Talpiot outside Jerusalem they share three bedrooms and a sitting
room with his parents-in-law and his daughter's husband.
What do you most like about Israel, I asked him.
'The people and the scenery. Almost every day when we were studying the
ulpan (the immigrants' crash course in Hebrew) in the north we went on
excursions.'
How does it compare with home?
'The biggest difference is that I am used to water. I used to live on the
bank of the river and here in Jerusalem I feel there is no water. I used to
go sailing with my friends every summer.'
And what do you find most difficult about living here?
'The main difficulty is not knowing the language. But now things are
improving. Second, the lack of friends and relatives.'
Do you find the Israelis resentful because there are so many Russians here
looking for work?
'You can't generalise: there are different kinds of people. I myself have
mostly met people who are very nice and ready to help. Maybe there are some
who are not happy about the Russians.'
You've suffered no victimisation because of it?
'No.'
Do you know people who have?
'I don't like blaming people without knowing the facts. You can't blame
people just from something you've heard.'
Have there been occasions when you have wished you had never come?
'I miss not working very much. But I have never thought of returning. We
have had no discussions like that in my family.'
At 50 years old it is quite late in life for such a big change, isn't it?
'Yes, of course it's very difficult. But I did it for the most part for the
sake of my children. Maybe if I had been alone I wouldn't have come here.'
Can you describe how living here has changed you? Do you feel a different
person?
'I lived in the Soviet Union for almost 50 years and although I understood
and realised many things, I was influenced by the Soviet propaganda and
ideology.
'Here I feel much more free. It's a pity that I wasted a lot of time on such
empty things: for example, studying the history of the Communist Party. I
used to study at the Institute of Marxism-Leninism and that also was a waste
of time. Now I realise it.'
While in the army Nathanson was invited to join the Communist Party. He
refused. 'I wasn't blind,' he said.
Do you see any similarity between the way the Russians treat the Jews and
the Jews treat the Arabs?
'It's very difficult to answer this question. To answer it you have to know
much more about history and roots. From what I can see those Arabs who live
in Israel feel very free and feel secure, while some Israelis even in their
own land feel they have to be wary when they come in contact with Arabs.
'I think that to understand Israel you must live in Israel. If you are
outside the country it doesn't look the same as if you live here. It's a
little bit difficult.'
He smiled warily. 'Everyone has his own problem in life.'

FT  09 MAY 92 / Arts: Mullova's Schoenberg
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ALTHOUGH THE future for three of London's orchestras has been settled, the
outlook for the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra remains uncertain: the
impression is that it will find a less than warm welcome on the South Bank
so long as its concerts are seen to be unadventurous.
So there is an irony that its three programmes this month under its Music
Director, Vladimir Ashkenazy, include a major Messiaen score, the
continuation of its Shostakovich cycle which is being recorded and, on
Wednesday, the Violin Concerto by Schoenberg. This last is a rarity in the
concert hall. A difficult work in every sense, it is shunned by audiences
and violinists in just about equal measure.
Its reputation as a heavyweight goes before it. Heard live, however, the
concerto is surprisingly light on its feet, the large orchestra used with
delicacy, the solo violin never wrestling to make itself heard. No doubt
Ashkenazy is a sympathetic accompanist, but then it would be difficult not
to give one's best support in this work to a soloist as immaculate as
Viktoria Mullova.
Where other players may struggle to get the notes, Mullova has no problems.
The part is well within her technical limits and she has time to make music
from it. This is not to say that her performance was an overtly emotional
one, for Mullova is a dispassionate performer, but she became expressive
simply by playing supremely well. There was never an ugly sound, but equally
there was no striving after prettiness for its own sake. Just pure and
beautiful music-making.
After the interval Ashkenazy and the RPO returned to give us their familiar
interpretation of Sibelius's Second Symphony. The grand lyricism of
Ashkenazy in the big romantic symphonies suits this one perfectly, as it
does the orchestra. If a move from the South Bank is in prospect, the RPO
might ponder that it would not sound as splendid at the Barbican.

FT  09 MAY 92 / Arts: Violence on the high seas - Nicholas Woodsworth needed
no fairy dust to find these pirates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS WOODSWORTH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN Wendy Darling and Peter Pan flew to Never-Never Land they used a
complicated process involving fairy dust and the thinking of happy thoughts.
When I stumbled out of a West End cinema one afternoon after watching Dustin
Hoffman single-handedly take on Peter and the Lost Boys, I, too, felt like
visiting the land of the pirates. Fairy dust is a nice professional
flourish, but quite unnecessary. I simply strolled down to the Thames below
Charing Cross, hopped onto a river bus, and headed east.
In fiction, pirate country is a sunny, far-away place of desert islands,
squawking parrots and endless noggins of rum. Pirates themselves are jolly,
hearty types, a bit wild and roguish at times, but loveable enough in their
own peg-legged way. In reality nothing could be further from the truth.
Never-Never Land begins at Wapping, and pirates are the most desperate,
unlovable characters you could ever stumble across.
As the river bus skimmed past ferries and barges, warehouses and offices, it
all looked innocuous enough. But as we passed through Wapping, one of the
crew pointed out Execution Dock and a long flight of steps leading down into
the water. It was here, at low tide mark - territory falling under Admiralty
jurisdiction - that for centuries captured pirates were hanged on gallows
erected on the river bed.
There was nothing jolly or romantic about this. Consider the notorious
William Kidd who, mercifully, was roaring drunk the day he was hanged here
in 1701. The first time he was strung up the rope snapped and he fell
staggering in the mud below. After the job was finally finished Kidd was
left to be submerged and re-exposed by the tide for a day or two, then his
corpse was tarred, strapped in an iron harness, and for years left to swing
in the wind on a gibbet as a warning to other buccaneers. It is a story that
would make the Darling children think twice about fooling around with magic
dust.
Had Wendy and her brother accompanied me a little further down-river to
Greenwich, they would have been unlikely to leave their beds ever again for
Never-Never Land. For at the National Maritime Museum pirates in their true
awfulness are on display in a new exhibition. With Fact and Fiction as its
sub-title, Pirates exposes the popular, glamourised view of pirates for what
it really is: a fanciful concoction, best consumed in a snug armchair on a
rainy day, with little basis in reality.
It is not only pirate classics such as Barrie's Peter Pan, Robert Louis
Stevenson's Treasure Island, or Arthur Ransome's Swallows and Amazons which
are the culprits. Stage musicals such as Gilbert and Sullivan's Pirates of
Penzance and a slew of Hollywood films featuring the likes of a
cutlass-swinging Errol Flynn are also to blame. From Lord Byron, whose 1814
manuscript of The Corsair is displayed, to Steven Spielberg, whose film
costume for Hoffman's Hook is on exhibit, we are all guilty of wilful
fabrication. So much so that there is no evidence to show that real pirates
had ever even heard of 'walking the plank'.
This is not to say that pirates as they actually existed - and still exist -
are not worthy of interest; the larger part of the exhibit, in fact, is
given over to them and shows that they are more intriguing than anything
Spielberg could dream up. Piracy has existed throughout history and in many
parts of the world; rather than the stock, cardboard cut-out figures we
usually imagine, they were a collection of individuals of highly different
origins, motives and destinies, with little holding them together as a group
other than a willingness to use violence to gain wealth on the high seas.
Contrast, for example, Sir Francis Drake and my own favourite pirate, Edward
Teach, better known as Blackbeard. Drake was the greatest seaman of his age,
the Queen's servant, and also a privateer - a man who sailed with a letter
of marque, or Crown commission, authorising him to plunder Spanish shipping
on its behalf in time of war. So lionised was he by the English public that
not even unofficial plundering and daring peacetime raids on Spanish
colonial ports prevented his being knighted by Elizabeth I.
Blackbeard, on the other hand, was a horrific, Rasputin-like figure who
brutalised the men who served him and terrified opponents by appearing in
the thick of battle with ribbons tied in his enormous beard, three pairs of
pistols strapped to his chest, and smoke-belching slow fuses tucked under
his hat. When the end finally came, it took five bullets and more than 20
deep cutlass wounds to bring Blackbeard down.
But different as they may seem, Drake, Blackbeard, Kidd, John Hawkins, Henry
Morgan, 'Calico Jack' Rackham, the cross-dressing female pirate Mary Read
and a score of other infamous pirates are in one sense much of a likeness -
they emerged from a 'golden age' of piracy which lasted from the 1670s to
the 1830s and was based largely in the Caribbean, first on the island of
Hispanola (present day Haiti) and later at the Jamaican pirate town of Port
Royal, 'the wickedest town in Christendom'.
One of the exhibition's attractions, then, is that among its graphic
displays, film extracts, sound simulations, robotics and documents and
memorabilia from pirate life, room has been found for inclusion of the
greater pirate world - mayhem in the Mediterranean, plunder in the Indian
Ocean, rapine off the south east-Asian archipelago, terror off Chinese
coast. Such an inclusion is merited, for east Asian piracy took place on a
vaster scale than it did in even in the Caribbean; witness the great 19th
century pirate fleet of the female pirate Ching Shih, who controlled 800
large junks and a pirate community of some 80,000 men and women.
But violently acquisitive as pirates were, few indeed led the luxurious life
myth has created for them. Most immediately spent what money they did gain
on drink and gambling, leaving little for the gentler pleasures, or even
essentials of life. If they took life easily. they gave it easily as well -
many died violently or of disease and destitution, without a penny in their
pockets. Measure these facts up against the colourful fiction of piracy,
however, and it is fiction that wins every time. Just ask the bloodthirsty
hordes queueing outside West End cinemas.
'Pirates: Fact and Fiction' runs at the National Maritime Museum until
September 6

<TEXT>
'WHAT'S happening?' enquire arts administrators of journalists, artists of
their agents. The answer is a resounding silence. Since David Mellor took
over as Secretary of State for the new Ministry of the National Heritage the
arts world has been coated in aspic, and is likely to remain so for the next
three months. Sensibly Mellor will closely scrutinise every aspect of his
rag-tag empire, which embraces the performing arts and broadcasting, sport
and the heritage, before making the profound changes destined to come from a
man with his ambition, energy and inclination. The first priorityis to find
an architecturally distinguished home for his 350 strong work force,
assembled from a host of ministries and currently based around the old
Office of Arts and Libraries. At least the team is in place, and Mellor
plans no additional junior ministers to handle the arts or sport on a daily
basis. He will take all the major decisions, allowing his number two, Robert
Key, to over-see the one area Mellor still feels ill at ease with - the
national heritage. A new PS, Hayden Phillips, has been brought in from the
Treasury to try and restrain expenditure. Mellor made it clear this week
that everything will be reviewed, including the Arts Council. He will read
with interest the Council's 'National Strategy for the Arts', the first
draft of which emerges next week, but there are already signs that the new
Ministry regards this as the unfinished business of the old regime. Under
Mellor the drift towards regional funding, to the devolution of the arts,
may well be halted, but the key funding decisions are likely to be made by
Mellor rather than a re-inforced Arts Council.
'I don't want this Ministry to be regarded as the old Office of Arts and
Libraries on wheels' said Mellor this week. He obviously envisages a much
more streamlined conveyance. Pushing the mobile metaphors further he is also
loathe to be regarded 'as a stage coach packed with gold travelling through
Indian territory and in danger of losing a few gold bars here, a few more
there, in skirmishes with Indians.'
The gold is obviously the proceeds of the National Lottery. The best
estimate is that the Lottery should be up and running by 1994 and capable of
generating up to Pounds 1.5b a year. This is an amazing amount of money. It
is just dawning on Mellor and his team (it has yet to penetrate the arts
world generally) that instead of being one of the smallest and most
impoverished of departments the Ministry for National Heritage could be
amazingly well endowed. The arts in the UK are about to embark on a period
of largesse not seen since the Prince Regent went on a buying spree.
Just consider the facts. The arts could receive Pounds 250m as its share of
the Lottery. It plans to concentrate the money on refurbishing the
superstructure of the arts, museum buildings and such like. In Year One it
could commit enough to shore up for a century the V&amp;A, the Tate, the British
Museum, and the National Gallery. In Year Two (if it was feeling soft
hearted) it could give Covent Garden the Pounds 90m it needs for its
re-development and fund a national dance house.
But what on earth is it going to spend the money on in Years Three, Four,
etc? No doubt the expenditure on the performing arts, which, in theory,
comes from a separate budget, will be trimmed somewhat, but you can just
imagine the picture stories in the popular tabloids - of derelict hospitals
wards, prefab schools on the one hand, while great palaces for culture,
providing nourishment for the middle classes, arise elsewhere. The arts will
have a fight on their hands holding on to the money if life and death public
services seem under funded.
No one has yet worked out whether the arts can handle all the extra money
which is targetted its way. If Mellor is looking for another transportation
metaphor to describe his department he might consider, then quickly reject,
'a gravy train'.
In his brief three month incarnation as Arts Minister in 1990 Mellor raised
hackles by his tangible support for the London Philharmonic Orchestra, of
which he had been a board member. The febrile world of London music will be
alert for more favouritism, especially as the LPO has made itself unpopular
since assuming the position of 'house' orchestra at the South Bank Centre
from the autumn.
The LPO has undoubted privileges, spelt out in the Tooley Report which
heralded its appointment. But it seems to want more and has run into
conflict with the Philharmonia, which acquired the status of 'best friend'
of the South Bank. In terms of performances there is not much between them -
50 subscription concerts a season for the LP0; 45 for the Philharmonia. Both
get the chance to rehearse in the Festival Hall.
But the Philharmonia's position of power without responsibility is
irritating the LPO and already there are clashes appearing in the musical
calendar. Next May for example the Philharmonia is performing Mahler's 7th
Symphony under Sinopoli and in the same month the LPO is entrusting the work
to Tennstedt. This is just the kind of thing that the residency was designed
to avoid.
In theory London's four commercial orchestras are entering a period of calm.
The LSO is resident at the Barbican, the LPO and the Philharmonia nestle on
the South Bank and enjoyseasons at Glyndebourne and Paris respectively,
while the RPO is free to tour the world and be commercial.
But the new scenario carries seeds of disaster. Next season the Festival
Hall will be dark on well over 50 nights for rehearsal time. Audiences have
been thinned by the recession and on average the Hall is less than two
thirds full. The LPO will be asked to present challenging concerts. We could
see a public reaction against a South Bank which appears to be either closed
or presenting music of the third Viennese School.
But if audiences yearn for the good old days of populist works the musicians
have never had it so good. Big increases in subsidy to the favoured
orchestras mean that earnings have more than doubled in the past four years
as the orchestras compete for the best players. The Philharmonia has even
introduced holidays and sabbaticals - on the strict understanding that the
musicians do not moonlight during their breaks.

FT  09 MAY 92 / Arts: Back to the classics - Radio
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By B. A. YOUNG
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CLASSIC Serials on Radio 4, on Saturday evening, repeated on Friday
afternoons, are the very thing for those who know the names of all the great
English novels but either read them too long since or have not read them at
all. I don't know when I read Smollett's The Expedition of Humphry Clinker,
but it is so full of incident I certainly could not remember half of it.
Scott Cherry's adaptation, extracting the events from the letters Smollett
presents them in, is packed with amusing narrative detail. The first
instalment on Saturday mostly covered Matthew Bramble's journey from
Brambleton to Bristol, Bramble being the splendid Timothy West. In his party
are his sister Tabitha, his nephew Jery, his niece Lydia, his doctor, Lewis,
the servant Winifred.
Love is frustrated whenever it appears - Tabitha's for Lewis, Lydia's for
the actor Wilson, whom Jery challenges to a duel but succeeds only in
killing a cow. Transient affairs like Jervis's death after climbing a
staircase to deliver a letter are done as importantly as the major things.
And Humphry Clinker? He is the ragged postilion the party meets on its
arrival in Bath at the very end of this first hour, in which there wasn't a
dull moment. Clive Brill was the director.
Radio 3's Drama Now on Tuesday, The Cello and the Nightingale, was less a
drama than a dramatic imitation of a feature. Patricia Cleveland-Peck wrote
it to mark the centenary of cellist Beatrice Harrison, and to recall her
fascinating achievement in making the BBC broadcast the nightingales singing
in her Surrey garden while she played the cello.
She had trouble in getting the Company (as it was then) to try anything so
improbable, even with sundry telephone calls direct to Mr Reith. When at
last all was agreed, the necessary kit spread all over the garden, a mike
next to the nightingales' nest, she also had trouble in getting the birds to
sing. She sat playing favourite items for a couple of hours - then, just as
the BBC was ready to pack up, they began. The broadcast was a tremendous
success, and was done again every year for 12 years.
Ms Cleveland-Peck had her troubles too, for the truth is that, for those of
us not involved, that evening was tedious. Reminiscences of Beatrice
Harrison's life, soliloquies of her thoughts as she played, touches of 1924
wireless, did not make it seem less so. Diana Quick was charming as Miss
Harrison, and Julian Lloyd Webber played Elgar, Delius, Dvorak and the
Londonderry Air.
What would Smollett have made of Radio 5's Open Mike on Monday, a six-part
piece by Shaun Prendergast about life in a local independent radio station,
Valley Sound? I reckon anyone as good on significant detail as Smollett
would certainly have cared about such things. Mike (Gary Love) is the
undisciplined guy who thinks the material they put out must attract
attention even if it's risky. He has got one of the girl reporters pregnant
and is virtually under three weeks' notice (though not for that). I could
not follow everything, because the voices (young, eager) are so much alike;
and at least so far there seems too little discipline in the station. But
I'll be back.
I heard the second of Radio 1's current social programmes, Tell it like it
is, to learn what new problem would be exhibited. There was miserable talk
of jealousy, poverty, bullying and sexual abuse, particularly of girls by
their mothers - not a common subject of discussion. How typical can all this
be of our society? And how are such wretched people persuaded to talk, not
to Samaritans, but to recording engineers condensing their wretchedness for,
as we must concur, public benefit?

FT  09 MAY 92 / Arts: Why artists were drawn to Dieppe - William Packer
reviews the Brighton Festival's principle exhibition
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM PACKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BRIGHTON Festival, feeling itself perceived as principally a festival of
music, has this year given its programme of exhibitions a particular
emphasis. Rendez-vous a Dieppe is its principal offering, a celebration, as
its sub-title puts it, of the town and its artists from Turner to Braque.
Admirably put together by John Willet, an English art-historian who lives
just outside Dieppe, it indeed answers that deceptively simple brief, and
the essentially uncurious visitor may pass happily down that chronology,
indulged at each point by particular yet often unfamiliar examples of the
highest quality.
Its true substance is quite as much in social as art-historical, its subject
the strong link established over more than a century, by way of Newhaven,
between the two opposing and yet so very different popular watering-places
that face each other across the Channel. But important though Brighton has
long remained to the English, as an occasional resort - raffish, bracing,
above all accessible - it has never drawn to it a community of artists.
Individuals may have come and gone, but there was never a group, a Brighton
school, an artists' colony. The serious creative traffic was always passing
through, and for the most part one way.
Quite why one town should become a hive and focus of creative energy and
another not is always an open question. It is not simply by a quality of the
picturesque, for both France and England have quaint and historic towns, all
still quite artist-free in any proper art-historical sense. The artist may
well stop for a while en route, but soon passes on, a few studies made,
perhaps, a canvas filled, but nothing more and never again. It takes a
Venice or a Paris to establish the interest permanently. Where a collective
habit does form, such election seems always arbitrary and temporary, a
creature of chance and circumstance.
Dieppe was always a special case, but even Dieppe's moment has come and
gone, with few easels now among the tourists. For the French painters at a
certain time, the harbours, cliffs and wide skies of the western Normandy
coast were obviously attractive, but no more so than anywhere else within
easy reach of Paris. The Seine valley soon drew Monet to the sea, for
example, and Braque came to live a little along the coast at Varengeville;
but even so, for the Frenchman, there was always the South.
For the English, however, France is the South, and Dieppe the first town of
the South and the great escape. For so many of us simply to be in France is
enough. In days of slower travel the temptation to draw breath after the
crossing, to stay a day or two and look around, was even stronger than it is
now. An artist might take a house and studio perhaps, find himself staying
longer than ever he planned, show his work to others who might well come
over and take a house - and stay rather longer than planned . . .
It is thus hardly remarkable that of the artists associated with Dieppe,
rather more are English than French, nor that of the French, some such as
Helleu and Blanche, should have had close English connections. Most
particular of all, it was Sickert who came and stayed, and by virtue of his
commanding authority among them, persuaded so many of his fellows and
disciples to follow him. In earlier years, such painters as Turner and
Bonington came over and passed through: between the wars, Ben Nicholson and
Christopher Wood came over to sit at the feet of Braque: but of them all,
the Sickert battalions at the turn of the century were those who made Dieppe
most their own.
Here they all are, the Camden Townites, Gilman, Ginner and Spencer Gore, the
fin-de siecle aesthetes, Conder and Beardsley, Ben's father William
Nicholson who is at the very least as significant a painter as his son, and
William Rothenstein, and Whistler, and Fergusson, and Matthew Smith. From
Delacroix and Daubigny to Monet and Pissarro to Braque and Gauguin, the
French are properly celebrated, but this remains, by its very nature and
emphasis, a gratifyingly English exhibition.

FT  09 MAY 92 / Arts: Falstaff grows in stature - Malcolm Rutherford reviews
Henry IV and other London openings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ADRIAN Noble's production of King Henry IV Part 2 has arrived at the
Barbican and, like Part I, is even better than when it was first performed
at Stratford a year ago. The triumph lies not only in the synthesis of the
two parts, but in the way that that Part 2 has elements not touched upon in
Part I. The most obvious is the move to the countryside. Aside from the
battle scenes, Part I is mainly about life in and around London. Where the
action ranges wider, it is to the outlying areas: Wales and Northumberland.
They are full of wild men like Glendower and Hotspur.
Part 2 moves into the civilised English countryside of Gloucestershire.
Instead of warriors it is full of slow-witted lawyers like the Justices,
Shallow and Silence; instead of tribal passions inspiring the troops, there
are reluctant conscripts like Francis Feeble and Ralph Mouldy. What we see
in Part 2 is the beginning of English nationalism. The next wars will not be
the southern English resisting the north, but all the English fighting the
French.
The Gloucestershire scenes in Noble's production are outstanding because
they show the provincial deference to the capital. To Justice Shallow,
Falstaff is not the disreputable, unreliable fellow he seems in London: he
is to be looked up to because he has stayed at the centre and been knighted.
In Gloucestershire, Robert Stephens's Falstaff looks like a man of
authority. He moves about the southern counties recruiting soldiers. He may
even drink less than Shallow; at least he holds it better. That is not how
he is seen in London.
The performances by David Bradley and Anthony Douse as Shallow and Silence
respectively are impeccable, as is that by Christopher Luscombe in the even
smaller part of Davy, Shallow's servant. How, you can see Falstaff
wondering, is it possible to get such a good valet in a land of yokels?
Other indelible scenes are first the illness, then the death of Julian
GLover's Henry IV. As the dying man's memories of a lifetime come back, he
recalls that there was less than 10 years between the deposition of Richard
II and now his own passing away. In the meantime, a nation has has
developed, or so Shakespeare would have us believe.
*****
One of the reasons why Ariel Dorfman's Death and the Maiden is such a good
play is its ambiguity: in the transition from dictatorship to democracy
nobody is quite sure who did what under the old regime and how much of the
past should be investigated. As a play, Karate Billy Comes Home at the Royal
Court's Theatre Upstairs, which is where The Maiden also began, is not in
the same league, but it is broadly the same genre. Just as betrayals ran
deep in Pinochet's Chile, in the old East Germany practically everyone spied
on everyone else. Too much is known about the recriminations now going on to
doubt the basic authenticity of Klaus Pohl's piece, even if the plot is
excessively melodramatic.
Billy was a prospective Olympic multi-gold medallist, having already swept
the board at the world student games in Bratislava. As such, he was a jewel
in the crown of the East German state, but was also being wooed to defect to
the US. The East Germans tampered with him medically in order to keep him at
home: he spent 13 years in an asylum developing some of the attributes of a
monkey man.
When the Berlin Wall came down he was released. Most of the play is about
who was responsible for for betraying him. Even the local pastor turns out
to have been an informer and Billy's devoted sister was not entirely
innocent. The piece contains an extraordinary scene where the sister
declares her incestuous love for her brother; it is not unmoving, but of
dubious relevance to the plot. In the background is a man from the Deutsche
Bank who has come to mop up the remains of the East German economy. He
learns that it is helpful to know how the informer system worked under the
old regime, for the old habits clearly die hard.
The play has its flaws, but strikes me as a more interesting work than
Howard Brenton's Berlin Bertie at the Royal Court's main house. It
concentrates on East Germany as it is and avoids spurious comparisons
between eastern and western decadence. Billy, wild-haired, wild-eyed and
full of animal strength, is superbly played by Kevin McMonagie. The
translation by David Tushingham; the direction by Stephen Unwin has moments
of genuine tension.
*****
It is hard not to like As You Like It. The most pastoral of Shakespeare's
plays, it has scarcely a touch of malice. Nevertheless, James Robert
Carson's production at Greenwich makes heavy going of it. The opening is
funereal and the eary scenes are stultified by over-formal costumes and a
peculiar Grecian frieze. When the scene changes to picnicland in the Forest
of Arden, however, the production perks up Philip Franks as Jacques performs
the remarkable feat of speaking the seven ages of man lines as if they had
just been written. He shines again when he makes his dignified, melancholy
departure at the end. There is nothing camp about Jemma Redgrave's Rosalind.
She hardly even looks as if she is dressed as a boy. Instead she is an
intelligent youth who has fallen madly in love and enjoying every minute of
it. This is a very youthful production which gets more exuberant as it goes
on. The cast includes a wonderful Welsh Phebe, Buddug Morgan.
*****
Viktor Slavkin's Cerceau, subtitled 'I'm Forty But I Don't Look It', is
playing for the first time in English at the Orange Tree in Richmond.
Written in 1983, its chief interest is in the way it foreshadowed glasnost
in the period just before President Gorbachev. The characters, gathered in
an inherited, but dilapidated country house outside Moscow, do not speak as
if they are wholly oppressed by the regime, but neither are they part of it.
They seem to be waiting for something to happen: these were, after all, the
years of stagnation in the Soviet Union. The debt to Chekhov and The Cherry
Orchard, written shortly before the revolution, is openly acknowledged by
Slavkin. Nothing much does happen: the guests at the house discover cerceau,
an old aristocratic game played with quoits on summer lawns and an old man
turns up who remembers pre-1917 Russia. The piece is lovingly translated and
directed by Adrian Brine and it certainly catches an atmosphere of ennui.

FT  09 MAY 92 / Arts: Odets in Ayckbournsville
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'THE TIME is 1938 and the place is a dentist's waiting room in a New York
office building.' In 1938, the year Clifford Odets wrote Rocket to the Moon,
he appeared on the cover of Time Magazine. He was 32, and the Broadway plays
he had already written included Waiting for Lefty, Awake and Sing, Paradise
Lost and Golden Boy. His kind of realism had an intense and immediate
influence on Elia Kazan, Arthur Miller and others. How interesting today, as
his works are becoming period pieces, to see Rocket to the Moon in
Scarborough - in Alan Ayckbournsville.
For one thing, this is less of a period piece than you might expect. Its
theme is perennial. Husband (dentist Ben Stark), almost 40 and henpecked by
wife (Belle), falls in love with secretary (Cleo). Secretary, almost 20,
falls in love with him. He feels he has never been so alive, she finds him
more appealing than any other man, but he cannot bring himself to leave his
wife.
For another, Malcolm Hebden has directed the play handsomely. Sarah-Jane
Fenton, playing Cleo as a Marilyn Monroe of 1938, is first-rate, always
quietly writhing in her tight uniform, perfectly catching the girl's accent
helplessly exploiting her teeth and eyes. Only Kenneth Price, as Ben, is too
weak; he lacks the part's mixture of neurosis and integrity.
Odets spices the story with humour and, thank heaven, with incidental
detail. Afterwards, you also remember gratefully the shrewd medico
neighbour, Frenchy Jensen (excellently played by Dale Ripley), the always
surprising father-in-law Mr Prince (James Tomlinson) and the fact that the
secretary Cleo has a gold-digger streak, lies about her background and is
fairly dumb. In an immortal line, she tells Ben 'You know something? I can't
read Shakespeare. The print's too small.'
The play has two big flaws. It is bogged down - as Arthur Miller's plays
have been too - by the leadenness of its philosophising and symbolism.
Characters keep reminding each other that this particular situation is
actually 'like millions of others.' Frenchy no sooner touches on the subject
of this love than he has to rhapsodise cynically about all Love. And the
sheer dramaturgy of Rocket is creaky. Ben seems to be a dentist virtually
without patients. But then, how could he have time for them? Even at 10 pm
his friends and acquaintances are busily popping in and out of his
waiting-room and catching each other in mid-revelation as if this were
Feydeau's A Flea in her Ear.

FT  09 MAY 92 / Arts: Achtung baby, it's U2 in Paris
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN HIS goodie-goodie old days Bono used to sweep on stage clad in black
leather and swathed in shades to treat his audience to a prayer. These days
U2's lead singer is still in leathers and shades, but he welcomes himself to
Paris in the bad-boy rocker tradition with 'The only problem with this city
is you never get to bed.'
U2 kicked off the European leg of their 'Zoo TV' tour at the Omnisport,
Bercy on Thursday night. 'Zoo TV', so-called in deference to Zoo Station in
Berlin where the band made most of Achtung Baby. Its latest album, is both a
set-piece for the album itself and a video extravanganza on the TV-addicted
inner urban angst of the 1990s.
The show started with a sequence of songs from Achtung Baby - all shrieking
electronic emotion and dark, despairing themes. The set, an electronic
playpen of giant video screens and clapped-out cars in fluorescent colours,
was a perfect back-drop.
U2 was at its best when taking Achtung Baby's angst to extremis. 'The Fly'
was a wonderful whirl of raw electronics accompanied by a staccato sequence
of words - 'Luxury', 'Chaos', 'Condom', 'Flower' - thumping on and off the
videos. The pathos of Bono's voice thrusting through the electronics in
'One' and 'Tryin' To Throw Your Arms Around The World' was eerily evocative
of the individual's struggle to surface through the clutter of everyday
life.
The only hitch was that there was little attempt to adapt Achtung Baby for a
live performance. Most of the time this was fine. But one song, 'Mysterious
Ways', fell flat sounding as though it sorely needed the support of the
techno-toys in the studio.
This is ironic given that it was only when all the electronic paraphernalia
was stripped away and band abandoned the electronic play-pen main stage for
a small podium - and in the second part of the show, when it rattled through
its old rocker numbers - that you realised how talented U2 really is. The
crowd, which had howled its appreciation throughout, went wild, as if with
relief, whenever the strobes were switched off and it could see the band
clearly on the stage.
The real appeal of 'Zoo TV' was how neatly it illustrated its own message. A
rock concert is, after all, the perfect platform to illustrate how
individualism can be crushed by the mechanics of modern media, marketing and
merchandising. At times U2 looked like victims of their own plot - as the
cameras chased them around the stage to video them against their own videos
and Bono, the singer who used to start his shows with prayer, splayed
himself crucifixion-style across one of the biggest screens of all.

ORPHEUS WITH HIS LUTE
by Elisabeth Henry
Bristol Classical Press (Duckworth) Pounds 30, 227 pages
THE BYWAYS of literature, like those of a city, can lead wanderers to
unexpected delights. Elisabeth Henry's book exemplifies this. In equal parts
charming and fascinating, it sets out to explore the Orpheus myth, and in
the process ranges with marvellous ease across time and the breadth of our
culture. We move in the company of Aristotle and Appolonius Rhodius, Virgil
and Monteverdi, Milton and Keats; we discuss Plato's views on the soul's
immortality, and Harrison's recently staged Trackers of Oxyrhynchus. We
explore the psychological effects of music; we witness conflicts between
classicism and romanticism; we ponder sexual love, religion and mysticism.
This is a rich mixture, but so lightly confected and elegantly served as to
be irresistible.
It is not surprising that a book on Orpheus should range widely. The story
touches so many nerves that it is hard to find a single area of human
creativity unaffected by it. It is like the note which, when struck, sets
all the strings of the orchestra thrilling in response.
At school, reading Virgil's Georgics, we learned that the beekeeper
Aristaeus pursued Eurydice, who stepped on a venomous serpent as she fled.
Aristaeus's bees died, and when he consulted the reluctant and metamorphic
seer, Proteus, to find out why, he learned that it was punishment for
Eurydice's death and its still more tragic sequel. For Eurydice was
Orpheus's betrothed, and when she died he sought her in Hades, employing his
potent music to charm its rulers. They agreed to let him take Eurydice back,
provided he did not look at her until they attained the light.
But he did look; and lost her again, this time for ever. He wandered the
country in an agony of grief, playing music of indescribable beauty and
sorrow. His music tamed savage beasts, who came and mourned at his side; and
clifftops and huge oaks uprooted themselves to follow him. But female
votaries of Dionysus, drunk and inflamed in their revels, angry that he
refused their invitations to sport with them, one night attacked him and
tore him to pieces. Virgil says that as his head floated down winding rivers
to the coast of Lesbos his deathless tongue cried, 'Eurydice, Eurydice]'
Much has been made of Orpheus's fatal backward glance. Leighton's painting
of the moment, with Eurydice imploring Orpheus's gaze, inspired the
eroticism of Browning's verse: 'But give them me, the mouth, the eyes, the
brow]/ Let them once more absorb me] One look now/ Will wrap me round for
ever.' In Monteverdi's opera, as in Ovid, it is not Eurydice's importunity
but Orpheus's anxiety that prompts his disobedience to the gods; he turns
because he is afraid she has weakened or fallen.
But the backward glance has been emphasised chiefly by Romanticism,
shallower than its rival tradition. It is notable that Eusebius, writing in
the fourth century, depicts Orpheus as subduing the powers of hell with his
mastery; but Poliziano, in 15th-century troubadour style, has him begging
Persephone to 'pity a poor lover.'
Eusebius invokes a majestic Orphic theme: the power of music, which can heal
and charm, reveal truths, put man in communion with the divine. Orpheus is
the type of many spell-binding musicians, like the Pied Piper and Mozart's
magic flautist. He is kin to David the psalmist; it says in 1 Samuel, 'when
the evil spirit from God was upon Saul, David took an harp, and played with
his hand; so Saul was refreshed, and was well, and the evil spirit
departed.' Shamans also used music to control spirits and visit the Beyond.
This illustrates music's connection with religion and inspiration.
Orpheus's 'katabasis', his journey to and from the underworld, is the
paradigm for many tales of heroes, gods and poets, from Odysseus and
Heracles to Christ and Dante. But Orpheus's journey is truly central: for it
underlies the belief in immortality crucial to Plato's philosophy, and
which, by way of Neoplatonism, entered Christianity. For centuries
Christians had no belief in a soul but anticipated bodily resurrection on
earth at the Second Coming. With this delayed sine die, Christianity
imported Orphic concepts of an immortal soul and judgment in the afterlife.
These and a dozen other themes of extraordinary fascination for anyone
interested in literature, psychoanalysis, poetry, philosophy and religion
crowd Henry's pages most readably. After each chapter she asks, what is a
poet? Here is my only reservation: her poet is too Dionysian for me, too
frenzied and uncontrolled.
It is odd that she should infer this from the Orpheus story; for he, said by
some to be Apollo's son, was destroyed by Apollo's enemy; the classic
overthrown by the romantic. Yet when Orpheus, priest of poets, went through
hell, he seems to me to have kept, on the whole, a classically very clear
head.

THE CHIEFS: THE STORY OF THE UK CHIEFS OF STAFF
by General Sir William Jackson and Field Marshal Lord Bramall
Brassey's Pounds 30, 508 pages
THE PROCESSES of deterring or waging war by industrialised democratic states
require that those charged with the execution of operations by armed forces
have a clearly defined subordination to elected governments. The alternative
is military dictatorship or the evolution of a state within a state, of
which von Moltke's 'Great German General Staff' provides the best-known
example.
The authors are right to devote a third of the text to narrating, in
considerable but necessary detail, why the period from the late 1880s to the
outbreak of war in 1914 was one in which Conservative and Liberal
governments, agreed on the necessity for creating a workable defence
organisation in the face of increased armaments by prospective enemies, were
also united on the necessity to keep the admirals and generals in their
place.
British governments during this period did succeed in attaining their
objective - thus giving all successors clear constitutional guidelines  -
but Britain being, in Campbell-Bannerman's apt phrase 'a fighting but not a
military nation', they failed to grasp that bureaucratic reform, whereby the
Admiralty and War Office did establish some semblance of co-operation, was
not the same as thinking hard about strategic issues.
The establishment of the Committee of Imperial Defence in 1904 was a step in
the right direction, but failed to provide governments and the armed forces
with the logical corollary to strategic thought, namely a staff structure
which would plan for deterrence or war, on a national, not an individual
Service, basis. The price for ensuring that the British sailor or soldier
remained merely 'a citizen in uniform' was demonstrably one which British
democracy had to pay, but the cost of subordinating strategy and the means
of implementing it to administrative reform was high.
The authors, having thus cleared the ground, put us further in their debt by
tracing the course of successive changes from 1914 to the present day: a
Cabinet Secretariat; the establishment of the Chiefs of Staff Sub Committee
of the CID in 1923 - but lacking an effective intelligence and planning
element until the 1930s; the evolution of a Ministry of Defence from the
second world war onwards; the rather crab-like course pursued by successive
Chiefs of Staff since 1945, whereby the Chief of the Defence Staff has
gradually become the focus of strategic thought, tri-service planning, and
the execution of operations in war, not their delegation to commanders in
the theatre.
The authors' commentary and their candidly expressed opinions really come to
a sustained critique of a central element in modern British history:
adhesion to imperial commitment, aversion from the Continental commitment.
The Falklands war in 1982 and the Gulf war in 1991 must be seen as a very
late flowering of imperialism, and however much one says that neither
conflict has any lessons for the future, and that Britains's primary
strategic role must remain in Europe, the authors clearly think otherwise.
There is merit in their arguments that 'out of area' crises and conflicts
are not only likely but will make demands on Britain's armed forces, but
there is a touch of casuistry in the supposition that if Britain had always
pursued an imperial (or strictly speaking maritime ) strategy and eschewed
the Continental commitment much British blood and treasure might well have
been spared. For which the answer would seem to be: two world wars might
have been prevented if Britain had honoured the Continental commitment in
time. But the Chiefs of Staff were not only 'terrified' of such a commitment
in the 1930s, whether in relation to France or Russia (the word is that of
an official historian, not this reviewer); their predecessors before 1914
were united in hostility to Haldane's concept of a British Expeditionary
Force.
The authors, in narrating the Falklands war from the inside, do, in a sense,
have the last word. What does emerge from their account is that the "War
Cabinet" was notably more belligerent in public than in Downing Street, and
that the resolution of the "Chiefs" was certainly needed at critical
moments. The Falklands war was not made by the Brass Hats, but the Frocks
certainly had cause for gratitude in that they ran it with both skill and
imagination. The Chiefs remained citizens in uniform, just.

JAZZ
by Toni Morrison
Chatto &amp; Windus Pounds 14.99, 229 pages
PLAYING IN THE DARK
by Toni Morrison
Harvard Univ. Press Pounds 11.95, 91 pages
TONI MORRISON'S fifth novel, Beloved, which won the Pulitzer Prize in 1988,
explored the immediate psychological aftermath of slavery in the US during
the post-Civil War Reconstruction era. Conceived as a sequel, Jazz is set in
Harlem in 1926 among the burgeoning community of African-Americans who fled
north after emancipation to escape landlessness and lynchings.
While the novel's unnamed narrator hymns 'the City' in confiding, colloquial
tones, relaying snatches of melody from street-corner musicians and
ubiquitous Victrolas, the Jazz Age and the Harlem Renaissance are only
obliquely evoked. Jazz is present principally as a motif, signalling a new
freedom and sensuality alongside an overwhelming compulsion to forget. 'Here
comes the new. Look out. There goes the sad stuff. The bad stuff . . .
Forget that. History is over, you all, and everything's ahead at last.'
The vision proves illusory for Joe Trace, a door-to-door beauty produce
salesman and his wife Violet, who arrived from Virginia 20 years earlier on
a 'dancing train'. The novel begins as Joe has shot dead his young lover,
Dorcas, whose face Violet has attempted to slash with a knife at the
funeral. It is the complex motivations behind this melodrama that unfold
through the fragmented narrative, with its shifting viewpoints and its
flashbacks to the south, of families dispossessed, houses burned, men hanged
and mothers absent or suicidal.
Through Morrison's fictional 're-remembering' of forgotten black histories
she suggests the delusory nature of free action where the determining demons
of the past have been neither exhumed nor exorcised. The music that
expresses freedom's 'sweet desolation' also contains a 'complicated anger',
disguised as 'flourish and roaring seduction', that can trigger
self-destruction.
Yet, in a narrative twist, Jazz reaffirms the possibility of freedom, of
transcending rather than succumbing to the past as 'an abused record with no
choice but to repeat itself at the crack'. In place of the sensational
events initially promised the reader, Joe and Violet opt for a healing, even
cloying, reconciliation, for 'figuring things out'. The storyteller
confesses both her power and her inadequacy, her characters having been
'busy being original, complicated, changeable, human . . . putting their
lives together in ways I never dreamed of'.
While Jazz displays Morrison's supreme ability to illuminate social process
and the sweep of history through character, those seeking the emotional
authority of Beloved or the visionary intensity of The Bluest Eye, Sula or
Song of Solomon, are likely to be disappointed in Jazz's preoccupation with
its own construction; the self-consciousness of the telling has perhaps been
at the expense of the tale
Morrison, a revered chronicler of the African-American experience, in a
collection of essays on the work of white American writers, challenges
'American Africanism': the 'disabling virus' of myths, stereotypes and
misconceptions of African peoples, to which her own fiction is a powerful
antidote. In Playing in the Dark she argues that, just as the
Enlightenment's concept of freedom was parasitical on the reality of
slavery, the rights of man yoked inevitably to the assumption of racial
hierarchy, the concerns of a nascent American literature were shaped by the
white relationship to a 'dark, abiding, signing Africanist presence'.
Developed with illustrations from Poe, Twain, Melville, Hemingway and
others, Morrison's argument provocatively extends critiques of colonial
literature (notably Edward Said's Orientalism, or the Nigerian Chinua
Achebe's dissection of Conrad) to white American writing in its relation to
its own subordinate black population. In doing so, she challenges the
'universalist' or 'race-free' pretensions of a literature whose habitual
resort to shorthand constructions of blackness marks it out as the product
of white writers with an assumed white readership.
More crucially, her sombre conclusion that racism 'is as healthy as it was
during the Enlightenment', its utility as a metaphor having outstripped its
ideological purpose in justifying economic exploitation, lays down a
challenge to others to share her own project as a writer: to 'free-up' the
language from the 'sinister, lazy, predictable racial codes' that pervade
and impoverish it.

HOUSMAN'S POEMS
by John Bayley
Oxford Pounds 25, 202 pages
A E HOUSMAN
by Keith Jebb
Seren Books (Bridgend, Mid-Glamo gan) Pounds 11.95
THE TIDE of taste ran strongly in Housman's favour during his lifetime -
copies of A Shropshire Lad were in great demand during the First World War -
and then it turned against him when he died in 1936. Cyril Connolly, writing
then in the New Statesman and Nation, declared:
'The truth is that many of Housman's poems are of a triteness of technique
equalled only by the banality of thought; others are slovenly, and a
quantity are derivative - not from the classics, but from Heine, or from
popular trends - imperialism, place-nostalgia, games, beer - common to the
poetry of his time. A Shropshire Lad includes with some poems that are
unworthy of Kipling others that are unworthy of Belloc, without the excuse
of over-production through economic necessity which those writers might have
urged.'
Further stick came from within Housman's own citadel of Cambridge, where
attacks on him were launched in Scrutiny. FR Leavis and IA Richards were
enraged by Housman's Leslie Stephen Lecture The Name and Nature of Poetry,
delivered in 1933, with its denigration of the Metaphysicals and most of the
English 18th century poets; and in which Housman propounded his famous razor
test for poetry: 'Poetry indeed seems to me more physical than intellectual
. . . Experience has taught me, when I am shaving of a morning, to keep
watch over my thoughts because, if a line of poetry strays into my memory,
my skin bristles so that the razor ceases to act. This particular symptom is
accompanied by a shiver down the spine . . .'
TS Eliot had, however, some good words to say for the lecture, and the new
young 1930s 'Macspaunday' poets (Roy Campbell's useful abbreviation),
especially Stephen Spender, did admire Housman; or seemed to until Auden put
the boot into Housman in his cruel sonnet about him. 'Deliberately he chose
the dry-as-dust,/ Kept tears like dirty postcards in a drawer . . .'
But since the Second World War the tide has turned once more and, as these
two books under review testify, Housman is riding high again. His work has
been kept alive by new and ever more complete editions - a quantity of his
poetry remained unpublished at his death - and by biographical revelations.
As is now well-known, Housman was homosexual but powerless to do much about
it. The great love of his life was a fellow undergraduate Moses Jackson, who
appears to have been completely indifferent to him sexually and who got
married sometime after Oxford without telling Housman. His career was spent
largely in India so that Housman rarely saw him, making memories of him all
the more powerful. As a Cambridge Professor of Latin and a Fellow of
Trinity, Housman (after ten years as a dogsbody in the Patent Office) was by
then largely restricted for his social life to the donnish world of High
Table; in term time at any rate. As an enthusiastic pioneer air passenger
Housman did fly off in the vacations to places like Paris and Venice, where
he seems to have enjoyed a special relationship with his gondolier. Some
cryptic notes in his hand on a piece of card that has survived suggest he
may have gone in for rented male companions in the French capital.
All this stands today as the sub-text to the poems about red-coats, bugles,
reveille, athletes, lost love, lads, lasses, and public hangings, those
poignant lyric poems full of memorable lines like 'An air that kills . . .',
highly individual versions of English pastoral. Christopher Ricks did a
useful job a few years ago editing the poems. His Penguin, AE Housman
Collected Poems and Selected Prose (1988) gives to the ordinary reader all
he needs of Housman's work in one convenient inexpensive volume. A complete
edition, based on fresh scrutiny of the heavily corrected manuscripts by
Archie Burnett, seems to be on the way.
Both Bayley and Jebb compare Housman to Larkin. There are striking
similarities between the two bachelor poets, most obviously in their
insistence on several degrees of separation between the private secret self
manifest in the poetry, and the public existence and activity of the
professional man: the professor of Latin literature and textual scholar in
the one instance; the university librarian in the other. Both happened when
they were young men to be students at the same Oxford college, St John's,
and both as old men left their unpublished papers in a mess for their
executors to tidy up.
Bayley claims that there is an even greater kinship between them than merely
one of external stance and of shared attitudes (pessimism about sexual
happiness, acute consciousness of deprivation, religious scepticism); he
argues that there is a kinship in the way their poetry works in the mind of
the reader.
'Meeting Housman or Larkin in their poems (he writes) can be like
experiencing a change of consciousness. Poetry like theirs gives us an
abrupt feeling of what it is like to be someone else, putting us in touch
with them more immediately, and as vividly, as might in other circumstances
be the case with a novelist and his characters'.
The comparison with Larkin is but one of many with the work of other poets
made by Bayley in his attempt to define Housman's deceptively simple
directness: Emily Dickinson, George Darley, Sturge Moore, John Davidson,
Walter de la Mare, Warren de Tabley, Paul Celan (the modern German poet of
the Holocaust, author of Death Fugue) are some of the surprising names he
throws into the ring alongside the expected ones, Shakespeare, Daniel,
Collins, Browning, Yeats. The book, though short, is taxing and
illuminating; it may be read not merely as a reappraisal of Housman but as a
meditation on the nature of poetry by a leading member of the Oxford English
school.
In seeing Housman in such a wide, international perspective Bayley tends to
neglect his local habitations and his homosexual nature, no doubt believing
these have been gone into more than enough already. He does not, for
instance, comment on the one poem Housman wrote about Oscar Wilde (without
actually naming him): 'Oh who is that young sinner with handcuffs on his
wrists?' By contrast Keith Jebb, whose first book this is, closely examines
this poem and the possible impact on Housman of the Wilde trials - they came
on at around the same time A Shropshire Lad appeared. Jebb, who is
perceptive about Housman the man as well as the poet, was born in
Shropshire. His short book, which starts splendidly and then seems slightly
to run out of steam, is part of a series, Border Lines, dealing with writers
and artists whose work and lives stem from the Border country between
England and Wales.
Housman was not a Salopian born and bred. He grew up in neighbouring
Worcestershire in a large family headed by a weak father but managed by a
caring mother whom he loved dearly, and, after her death, equally well by a
friendly step-mother. Ludlow and Shropshire at the period of the Boer War
were for him legendary inspirational romantic regions, not areas he knew at
all well at first hand. Nonetheless, like Shakespeare and Venice, he brings
them to life with a sense of plausibly realised actuality. The relevance of
his poetry, several wars and holocausts later, is something made abundantly
clear by both these books. Connolly's final twist of the knife was his
remark that Housman 'will live as long as the BBC'; but it begins to look as
if Housman will be the more enduring of the two.

FT  09 MAY 92 / Property: Town and gown don't mix much - John Worrell finds
that Cambridge has too many cars and not enough residential roads
</HEADLINE>

THERE IS a touch of oil and water about Cambridge.
This flat Fenland city, on a quiet tributary of the river Great Ouse, has
among its 103,000 residents 14,000 university students, 2,000 polytechnic
students and, at any one time, an indeterminate number of transitory
foreigners learning English. Its student population is the highest per
capita in the UK. Including teaching staff, and the staff to service them,
the academic fraternity accounts for nearly a fifth of the city's
population. But the academics barely mix with the indigenes.
In the last decade or so, another globule has appeared in the form of new
industries drawn in by the university's cerebral power. This section of
Cambridge's population is slightly more assimilatory, because its members
tend to be there longer-term. But a good number of its higher paid workers
drive in each day from elsewhere, thus contributing minimally to the city
community and massively to the city traffic.
According to the city planning department, Cambridge now provides 80,000
jobs within the city, and a further 36,000 jobs in the immediate hinterland
which includes Cambridge Science Park. That is more than enough employment
to support a community twice its size. It also means 30,000 inward daily
commuters to the city itself.
The effect on the city's housing market is complex and difficult to
quantify. Relatively high wages from an inherently strong local economy,
with a largely recession-proof educational element at the heart of it, would
seem to be a plus. Cambridge has weathered recession relatively well so far.
But it is a two-edged sword for the community as a whole.
At the bottom end, relatively affluent students can usually outbid low
earners for private rented accommodation. To the average householder, Pounds
50 or Pounds 60 per head per week for bed and breakfast from people who are
otherwise hardly in the house is preferable to tenants on income support or
housing benefit who may be there most of the time.
Last year Cambridge City Council accepted 307 statutorily homeless families.
That comes close to 1,000 people; a very significant proportion of the
non-academic community, and one which has grown from almost nothing in 10
years. Such families accounted for 75 per cent of council housing
allocations in 1991, and their numbers are expected to increase.
The demand for rented accommodation stems not so much from the university
(92 per cent of its undergraduates and 30 per cent of its postgraduates live
in college residence or in rooms in university-owned houses), but from the
more recently expanded polytechnic and language colleges which are less able
to house their students.
By the same token, you would suppose that demand in the renting sector would
offer an opportunity to hard-pushed mortgagors on the lower and middle rungs
of the housing ladder to let out a bedroom or two. There are no reliable
figures on how many actually do so, because most people do not inform their
lender that they do so - though they are supposed to. Estate agents say that
repossessions have increased (the first question from cheerful potential
purchasers is often whether any repossessed houses are available); but most
agree that Cambridge seem to have avoided the worst effects of the housing
downturn.
Cliff Verrill, assistant general manager of the Cambridge building society,
confirms this: 'There has been a slight increase in arrears, but we do not
have a problem. Cambridge as a whole is certainly not as bad in that respect
as other parts of the country.'
He adds that where problems do occur, his building society is naturally keen
to do everything to help borrowers in any way possible. 'We do not actively
promote the renting ethic, but if borrowers are in trouble, renting is
certainly one option they could look at.'
Although there was a substantial drop from the peak of 1988, a price survey
by the society showed that average city centre prices were holding up
reasonably well. At the end of December 1991 they ranged from Pounds 65,000
for a small terrace to Pounds 102,000 for a modern detached house. While
that generally represented a small drop over the preceding year, small
terraced houses had actually risen in value, somewhat against the trend
elsewhere in East Anglia.
To some extent this may be explained by captive demand in a relatively
buoyant city. 'City properties are easier to sell than country properties,'
says Martin Green of Catlings, the house agents. 'That has always been the
case. And there is always a demand for correctly priced first-time buyers'
houses.'
But as Ian Purkiss, of estate agent Hockeys, points out: 'A healthy letting
sector means that there are always small speculators who will try to buy
with a view to letting. A house worth Pounds 65,000, let to four students,
would probably produce about Pounds 650 per month, which isn't a bad
return.'
At the upper end of the market, much of the quality housing in the central
area is already owned by the colleges of Cambridge University - constantly
in the market for more housing to accommodate their students and staff.
Anything of the right quality in the right place with the right planning
profile (the city council is not always willing to see large houses divided
into small units) is usually snapped up. Most vendors are aware of this
specific demand, and properties often sell without reaching the open market.
But supply is limited. For the fact is that beyond the Backs along the river
Cam, the colleges, and the ancient streets of the centre, Cambridge is a
surprisingly bland city, with rows of Victorian, Edwardian and inter-war
property, and a very limited supply of distinctive housing. As Jock
Lloyd-Jones of Bidwells puts it: 'Cambridge is not blessed with its fair
share of prime residential roads. One could perhaps name half a dozen good
roads, and after that one is struggling. What has been proved time and time
again throughout this last year in Cambridge is that location counts more
than anything when it comes to a difficult market.'
No one presumes to know where the market will go from here. Economic
uncertainty and election prospects are invoked as reasons for not giving a
view. What is clear is that the new industrial base which the cerebral power
resources have attracted and nurtured is a resilient creature in the face of
the present economic malaise.
Despite its share of casualties, it seems to be self-regenerating; it looks
set to grow as much as economic conditions and planning considerations will
allow. Its demand for housing for its highly paid employees tends not to be
directed at the city so much as at Cambridgeshire's outlying villages -
hence the commuting problem. Most local feeling is that the further out
housing is pushed without curbs on employment, the worse will the traffic
problem become.

ARE YOU looking for an old rectory? And hoping to buy it immediately the
parson moves out? You will find unexpected snags and attractions, and a
delightful bonus under a law passed 216 years ago.
The usual rectory is a solid 18th or 19th century house, reflecting how the
vicar stood in society. Some fine specimens are even Edwardian. It will
probably be in the heart of the village, which is a boon for getting help
and for deliveries, because everybody will know where you live. There will
be plenty of bedrooms, larders and outbuildings, and you can be sure of at
least three decent reception rooms. (The parson needed a study to write his
sermons.)
It is not surprising that rectories have been so popular. The Church has
been selling them hard since the 1960s, but by now it has very few such
properties left. If one does come up, give it special attention, even if it
looks a mess and the garden is a jungle. It is bound to need painting, but
the fabric should be sound - thanks to the Church's system of five-year
inspections. And, as the first private buyer, you have a rare chance to
re-do it and put in bathrooms the way you want, rather than suffer some
intervening owner's 'improvements.' Do not get upset if negotiations take
time. The church is an institution for eternity, which is how it sees its
investments and its property. Furthermore, the house could be sold with more
restrictions than you expected, although these are hardly likely to impede
you. You will almost certainly be forbidden to turn it into a pub, or to
make noise during services in the church next door. And you probably will
not be allowed to call it the Old Rectory. The usual reason given is that
people seeking counsel may come to the wrong house (although only three lots
of giggling couples came in the early years to our former rectory - they
wanted me to marry them).
In pre-poll tax days, parsonages were re-rated when they went private.
Something similar will happen with the council tax. Our rateable value went
up eight times, which affected the water bill. If there is a meter, it could
pay to negotiate to keep it and be ahead of the crowd when meters become
mandatory in a few years.
If you buy glebe land for a pony paddock, beware of a hazard called chancel
repair liability. Glebe is land used by the parson to supplement his income,
either by letting it or working it himself. Since before the Reformation,
the owner of the glebe has had a duty to pay for repairs to the church's
chancel. In effect, the parson paid to maintain his holy bit of the church
at the east end with the altar.
This arcane liability can pass to any succeeding owner, although it is most
unlikely that any parochial church council will invoke it. But because it is
a charge on the owner, and not on the land, it will not show up in normal
searches.
The Law Commission recommended that the liability be repealed but the lord
chancellor's department has still to decide if it will introduce
legislation. In the meantime, it might be wise not to raise the matter, as
the parson and church council may be unaware of the liability.
If you are worried, though, go to church and see what you might be letting
yourself in for.
If the chancel looks in bad shape, suggest your solicitor seeks an indemnity
against liability from the diocesan board that will be handling the Church's
negotiations.
The good news is the Ecclesiastical Residences Act 1776. It says says that
when a rectory moves from Church to private domain, you do not have to pay
stamp duty.
Finally, when you complete the sale, the parson will sign as the vendor  -
because what you have just bought is, by long custom of the church, the
parson's freehold.

FT  09 MAY 92 / Travel: Toasting the dead at the end of the earth - Nicholas
Woodsworth finds a warm welcome among the fearsome Svans of Georgia
</HEADLINE>

WHEN NINO Ivanishvili was 18 and studying English at the University of
Tiblisi, she spent her summer vacation in an isolated village high in the
Caucasus mountains. It was here, one sunny afternoon, that she was kidnapped
by a young man driven half-mad by the sight of her bathing in a nearby
mountain stream. Without knowing it, throughout the summer Nino had been
under the constant observation of the son of one of the peasant families in
the village, a young man of few words and strong passions. Normally she
would have been safe from such attentions, for the code of social conduct in
these mountains is strong. But this is also an area of fierce and enduring
blood feuds. The fact that Nino was the guest of a family engaged in a
vendetta with the young man's family made her fair game and an object worthy
of theft. Had it not been that Nino's screams were heard by her hosts as the
young man threw her on to a horse and galloped into the hills, Nino today
might be a mountain man's unwilling wife rather than a professional
translator. A mounted chase ensued, rifle fire was exchanged, and the young
man eventually relinquished his prize and retreated. Nino subsequently made
a rapid return to the city. 'What is the name of the place where this
happened?', I asked Nino when she had finished telling me this story one
afternoon not long ago. We were sitting in a gloomy restaurant off an
exhaust-choked street in Tiblisi. For months the Georgian capital had been
an unhappy place, beset by political violence, shortages and insecurity. But
up above the level of the street, over the smog and strained faces, I could
see a serene blue sky, and imagined it set against snow and high mountain
passes.
'It is called Svaneti', she replied. 'It is far into the Caucasus, and very
difficult to get to. There probably isn't even enough petrol available these
days to get there.'
Immediately I wanted to go to Svaneti, and persuaded Nino to take me there,
petrol or no petrol. Anywhere where such reckless, medieval robbery could
still take place must, I reasoned, be well worth a visit.
Svaneti, in the high Caucasus of north-western Georgia, is indeed a remote
and inaccessible area, and it took us 14 spine-jarring hours in a
Russian-built jeep to get there. We were not the first to go by motorised
vehicle - rough, unpaved roads first began replacing mountain trails there
in the late 1930s - but Svaneti continues to be four-wheel-drive country,
the wildest and least developed region in the trans-Caucasus.
In fact, what little I had been able to pick up about the Svans, a proud and
fiercely independent people with a reputation for violence, left me hoping
that 50 years of socialism had at least had some calming effect on their
character.
Certainly pre-communist Svans had little liking for outsiders. In the late
19th century, I learned, Puta Dadeshkeliani, a feudal lord from the Georgian
lowlands, foolishly tried to extend his influence into Svaneti. The Svans
invited him to a meeting in front of one of their churches, whereupon the
entire congregation helped pull a string attached to the trigger of a rifle,
thus giving each present the pleasure of killing the intruder.
Perhaps the Svans had been right to resist foreign intrusion; Soviet
socialism has left ugly traces on the face of Georgia. Heading westward over
the plains towards the Black Sea, we drove past factories where chimneys
belched toxic green smoke on to adjacent vineyards, past concrete housing
developments hunkering in the middle of vegetable plots, past state
co-operatives where cannibalised tractors and farm machinery littered the
fields.
But communism has had a tougher time making marks on one of the world's
great mountain ranges. From the sub-tropical plantation town of Zugdidi,
near the Black Sea coast, we saw the Caucasus rise with little warning, dark
and massive, above citrus groves and long alleys of tea bushes. Half-an-hour
later we were into the hills, and had left the world of socialist
reconstruction behind.
This is a wild, rough land. The higher we climbed, the more rugged and
unfinished-looking the mountains became. 15,000 ft summits left the road in
shadow. Boulders the size of houses were strewn through river valleys. Great
chunks of fallen mountainside sat battered and raw at the bottom of deep
canyons. Wherever wide swathes of pine forest had been knocked down by
avalanches, bare rock and torn soil lay exposed. In the Caucasus, it seems
as if the work of creation is still in process.
Even the people we passed had a rough, primitive air. Riding stocky
Caucasian ponies, their bristly, unshaven faces surmounted by caps of brown
felt, the men looked like brigands. Their women, dressed in black woollen
skirts, trudged along the roadside bent double under the weight of heavy
backpacks. Some of the locals, apparently, had not even discovered the
wheel, or at least disdained its use - they were dragging tons of firewood
along the muddy road on sleds of heavy wooden runners.
'What are those shrines?', I shouted to Nino as the jeep bucketed round
hairpin bends under the direction of Otar, our maniacal Georgian driver. I
pointed to a curious roadside construction, something like a telephone box,
where inside, on a little shelf, I could see a framed photo, flowers, a
bottle and two glasses.
'They mark places where people have been killed in road accidents', Nino
shouted back. 'When friends or family pass by, they stop and toast the dead
with a drink.' Judging by the number of shrines and empty bottles piled
beside them, crashing cars and toasting the dead are equally popular
activities in these mountains.
Upwards through the Svan homeland we drove, until we could drive no further,
and stopped at Ushguli. At 7,200 ft it is the highest permanently inhabited
village in Europe, and feels like the end of the earth.
The 19th century English traveller Douglas Freshfield described the Svans as
'the most savage and dangerous-looking set of people I have ever come
across.' Entering Svan villages, he encountered inhabitants who, 'yelling
and jabbering, barred the way, while others brandished swords, daggers and
pistols.'
But unlike Puta Dadeshkeliani or Douglas Freshfield, we skidded up through
the manure-sodden lanes of Ushguli unarmed and without hostile intent. In
return, the villagers brandished nothing at us but smiles. In no time at all
we were comfortably installed in a kitchen full of the odours of good things
cooking, and warming ourselves with the help of a cast-iron stove and
glasses of mead made from alpine honey. Our host, Kolia Nijaradze, may have
looked like a wild-eyed bandit, but a rough demeanour hid only a gentle
cattle farmer.
Perhaps it is their demanding environment that makes the Svans look so
tough. Winters in Svaneti last eight months, with temperatures often dipping
below -30`C. Snowfalls are extremely heavy. When a Svanetian tells you he is
frequently cut off from the outside world, he does not merely mean that the
roads are blocked, but that he cannot get out of his front door. Snow is
sometimes so deep that the houses of Ushguli disappear entirely.
In times like these, and when avalanches roar down the slopes of the
surrounding mountains, Svanetians retreat to their 100-ft watchtowers. Built
in the middle ages of granite and slate, the strength of the watchtowers
remains something of a mystery. Russian chemical engineers analysing the
composition of Svaneti mortar claim egg yolk was an essential ingredient.
But Soviet science was never able to explain how the Svans managed to amass
enough eggs to build over 60 of these tall towers. Now it never will.
But if the Svans lead a rigorous life in their mountain fastness, their
isolation has given them a special attitude to the rare visitors who do
happen by. Caucasian medieval tradition has it that guests come from God,
and should be treated accordingly. If family feuding ranks high in the
Caucasian code of honour, generosity, friendship and hospitality towards
strangers ranks even higher. The only real danger a visitor to Svaneti runs
is cholesterol over-dose from the food and drink with which he is plied from
morning to night.
The sun shone, the birds sang, the snow above us glittered in the thin
mountain air. Nino, Otar and I wandered among the cows and goats scattered
on the alpine pastures surrounding the village. We climbed watchtowers and
visited the church where Puta Dadeshkeliani came to a sticky end. We gorged
ourselves on a suckling pig killed in our honour. We listened to stories
about bear hunting, mountain trout fishing and killer avalanches. We were
toasted in vodka that ran like water. We sang Georgian counterpoint in
three-part harmony.
We did, in fact, just about everything that pleased us, with one exception.
When Otar and I suggested a swim in the clear mountain stream that ran
through the hills not far from the village, Nino, for reasons of her own,
declined to join us.

FT  09 MAY 92 / Food: The Rhone stars shine - Nicholas Lander visits some of
France's most serious restaurants
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS LANDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
I HAVE never forgotten my mother's account of a trip she made down the Rhone
in the late 1940s.
On the way to the south of France the gastronomic highlight was to be dinner
chez Pointe, at Le Pyramide in Vienne, then the Rhone's finest restaurant.
The diners failed to allow for the heat, the dust, or the stray animals on
poor French roads, and they finally arrived at 11.30pm  - too exhausted even
for an omelette, which was the only item on the menu at that hour.
Today's travellers along the Rhone face no such problems. The region is
served by the TGV and autoroutes. German and Swiss diners are almost as
prevalent as locals, and any Parisian could easily be chez Pic or Troisgros
in time for lunch after a none-too-early start. There is no shortage of good
places to visit, and a wide variety of prices.
Les Cedres in Granges-les-Beaumont (75.71.50.67) boasts Jacques Bertrand -
at 24 years old the youngest Michelin-starred chef in France. Set price
menus here run from FFr140-FFr300. Mondragon has La Beaugraviere
(90.40.82.54), a restaurant with a superlative wine list. Guy Jullien, its
chef, makes a speciality of truffles at relatively reasonable prices.
Even the FFr125 menu at the Chalet de la Boule d'Or (77.26.20.68), in the
small town of Feurs (population 8,000), turned into a five-course affair,
with a well-prepared main course of roast fillet of salmon and a wonderful
cheeseboard.
There is a plethora of good restaurants in the Rhone valley and its environs
 -there have been been for years - with many at the top of the culinary
tree. Le Pyramide, after a lengthy decline, is enjoying a renaissance under
Patrick Henriroux. Pic and Troisgros have held three Michelin stars for
almost 30 years.
Neither restaurant is what it was. I do not mean that they are no longer
serving the same food - Troisgros, in particular, has been a standard bearer
for a modern, lighter style of cooking - it is rather that their physical
aspects have changed markedly.
When Pic moved from the countryside to its present location, just before the
Second World War, it was to the outskirts of a small town, Valence, which
has grown significantly. The restaurant now stands in the suburbs, no more
than a mile from the Valence Sud motorway exit.
We ate very well at Pic. As at almost all today's top restaurants, the best
value lies in one of the fixed-price menus rather than a la carte. One
particular dish - points of very fresh asparagus topped with beurre blanc
and caviar - was simple but stunning.
My most lasting memory of this meal will be of Jacques Pic himself. An
extremely sprightly 60-year-old, with a mischievous twinkle in his eye, he
was in his chef's whites greeting all his guests at 7.30pm as I walked
around the small garden - the pristine kitchen has a large plate glass
window overlooking it. He was there, still in his whites, at 11.30pm to say
goodnight. When we checked out at 10.15 the following morning he was back in
the kitchen.
Jacques now cooks alongside his son, Alain. This is similar to the
arrangement at Troisgros, where Pierre presides and his sons, Michel and
Claude, dispense. But the transformation over the past 50 years of the
simple Troisgros restaurant - opposite Roanne railway station - into today's
culinary colossus is even more marked.
Although its population is only 40,000, Roanne is a wealthy city. An
armaments factory and a booming textile industry add up to two good incomes
for most families; a joint income quickly spent on eating and drinking well.
Until recently Roanne boasted five Meilleurs Oeuvriers de France, the
highest qualification a French chef can achieve: two at the Troisgros
restaurant, two with their own patisserie shops, and one charcutier.
The textile business brought a weekly influx of commercial travellers who
walked out of the station and into the nearest restaurant. Jean-Baptiste
Troisgros fed them well, and made them feel at ease by providing a large
communal table at which to enjoy the restaurant's food, wine and gossip.
Roanne has repaid the debt it owes the family by painting the railway
station salmon-pink and green in honour of the Troisgros signature dish,
escalope of salmon with sorrel.
The family, by dint of talent and hard work, now sits atop a culinary
empire. Like any empire, it emits good and bad influences. The ultra-modern
design of the restaurant is highly controversial; for me, it demonstrated
none of the taste which made my meal enjoyable. Neither did the enormous
glass showcase - with everything from jams to whiskies for sale - which
confronts you as you enter.
But once seated, I found the service and the food exceptional; in
particular, two fish dishes. Half a lobster perfectly grilled with a chive
butter was preceded by a mousse of scallops which contained the last of this
season's sea-urchins. It arrived at the table in a small blue and white soup
dish, glistening white like a snow ball.
After dinner, Michel Troisgros told me that my appreciation of this dish had
been surpassed by diners at another table that evening. They had enjoyed
this dish so much that they had ordered an extra two servings before the
rest of their meal.

of the pleasurable kind. The myth that Spanish food and drink begins and
ends with tourist-trap gazpacho, paella and sangria is about to be exploded
once and for all. Maria Jose Sevilla is poised deliciously and passionately
to dispel the crude caricature and to open our eyes to the true and
infinitely more subtle character of culinary Spain.
In the course of five television programmes and in an accompanying book she
takes us on a tour of Galicia, the Basque country and Navarra, Catalonia,
Madrid and the Mesetas, and Andalusia.
We cannot talk about la cocina, she insists. There is a plurality of cooking
styles. Each region has its own local traditions, born of the terrain and
the seas that bound it, shaped by Greek, Roman, Moorish and other influences
mingling with the indigenous culture - and the evolution goes on today. I
have travelled with Maria Jose Sevilla in Spain and witnessed first hand her
passion for the cooking of her country. She has an inquiring mind and
extensive knowledge of wines as well as of local ingredients and cooking.
She lights up when talk turns to pork and beans or Basque fishermen's stews,
and she welcomes the chance to roll up her sleeves and start mixing garlic
and spices into freshly minced pork to make chorizo.
If her television programmes are as inspiring, they will introduce the
viewer to the producers of a lovely array of hams, cheeses, olive oils and
wines, many of which are almost unknown in the UK. They will follow Sevilla
into markets bustling with spice stalls, tripe stalls, dazzling displays of
fresh fish, and a great deal more. And they will feature this ambassadress
for the good food and drink of regional Spain, aproned and wooden- spooned,
aiding and abetting her compatriot chefs and home cooks as they prepare
dishes for our delectation. Here, as an appetiser, are three recipes from
the book.
CHICKEN LIVER PROFITEROLES (serves 6)
Maria Jose Sevilla makes these unusual profiteroles to float in a rich meaty
caldo made with chicken, a Serrano ham bone and oxtail. They would also be
good to garnish the highly flavoured pure chicken broth I wrote about
recently.
2 tablespoons olive oil; 4 oz plain flour; 2 eggs, beaten plus 1 egg yolk; 9
oz chicken livers; 4 oz pine kernels.
Put the oil in a pan with 8 fl oz water, some salt and pepper. Bring to the
boil. Away from the heat tip in the flour. Beat well until the mixture forms
a ball which comes away cleanly from the sides of the pan.
Put the dough into a bowl and work in the two eggs. Spoon or pipe the
mixture into walnut size balls, and space them out on a greased baking
sheet. Bake at 350`F (180`C) gas mark 4 for 15 minutes until puffed up and
golden brown.
Cut a slit in the base of each profiterole and set them aside to cool
slightly while you blend the chicken livers, egg yolk and pine kernels in a
food processor until creamy.
Pipe or spoon the filling into the profiteroles and drop them into a pan of
piping-hot soup. Simmer for 2 minutes. The filling will cook in the hot
soup. Serve immediately.
ESCALIVADA (serves 4)
This is a very traditional dish from Catalonia. The instructions given here
are for baking it in the oven, but Sevilla says if you can make escalivada
griddled over charcoal, so much the better.
1 lb small aubergines; 2 red peppers; 2 Spanish onions; 2 potatoes; 3
tomatoes; 4 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil; 2 tablespoons chopped
parsley.
Rub all the vegetables with some olive oil. Place the first four sorts on a
baking tray and bake for 45 minutes at 350`F (180`C) gas mark 4. Add the
tomatoes and bake for a further 15 minutes or so until all the vegetables
are cooked. You may need to vary the cooking times depending on the size of
the vegetables.
Peel the cooked vegetables with your fingers. De-seed the peppers and
tomatoes. Tear the aubergines and peppers into thin strips, the tomatoes
into pieces, and slice the potatoes and onions.
Arrange the vegetables on a serving dish and season with salt and pepper.
Pour the remaining oil over the vegetables, sprinkle with parsley and serve
warm or cold.
MERLUZA EN SALSA VERDE (serves 4)
Sevilla describes this as one of the pillars of Basque gastronomy. She
advises sprinkling the fish with a little sea salt and resting it in the
fridge for a couple of hours before cooking, and warns against allowing the
oil to get too hot - the garlic should stew, not fry. She tells me that the
recipe is demonstrated on television. Don't miss it: the way the gelatin
seeps from the fish as it cooks and mingles with the oil to make the sauce
is intriguing.
4 x 5 oz hake steaks; 3 1/2 fl oz olive oil; 3 garlic cloves, peeled and
sliced; 2 fl oz dry white wine;  3/4 fl oz fish stock or water; 4 parsley
sprigs, finely chopped; 6-8 clams, scrubbed (optional); a few green
asparagus stalks, blanched (optional).
Put a flameproof earthenware cazuela over an indirect heat. Pour in the oil.
When it is warm add the garlic. Cook until light golden, then strain the oil
into a container and reserve the garlic separately.
When the oil has cooled slightly return half of it to the cazuela and set
over low heat. Add the fish, then take the cazuela off the heat.
Hold the pot with both hands and shake constantly in a circular movement.
Add the rest of the oil little by little and shake until a thick creamy
white sauce is achieved. Add the garlic and carry on shaking the pot.
Return the pan to the heat, add the wine, stock or water and parsley and
cook for a couple of minutes. Then add the clams and asparagus and cook for
a further minute. Discard any clams that remain closed, and serve.
Spain On A Plate by Maria Jose Sevilla, is published by BBC Books at Pounds
14.95. The five-part television series of the same name begins on BBC 2 on
Friday May 15.

FT  09 MAY 92 / Wine: Montrachet's cosmic dust - Jancis Robinson meets a new
female force in the world of wine
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANCIS ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR THE organic wine movement Anne-Claude Leflaive must be the best thing to
have happened so far. Or perhaps the second best thing after this year's
saga of illegal chemical traces in various Italian wines.
Organic, ecologically-conscious vine cultivation has been increasing in
recent years, but mainly on the fringes of the wine world. Anne-Claude
Leflaive, new co-manager of the world-famous Domaine Leflaive in
Puligny-Montrachet, is so far the only world-famous wine producer in
Bordeaux or Burgundy publicly to embrace what to many seem self-evident
principles of planet protection.
Her new system for Leflaive's enviable spread of top quality vineyards is
not just any old organic one, but the Steiner-inspired biodynamie, which
integrates wholly natural treatments with the movements of the cosmos.
A warm, frank woman of 36, she is the eldest child of the courtly Vincent
who ran the Domaine Leflaive until serious illness in 1989 took him away
from the day-to-day decisions he shared with his nephew Olivier (who also
runs the separate wine merchant business Olivier Leflaive Freres).
Burgundian inheritance laws are famously complicated; Anne-Claude gives the
impression that the US presidential race is relatively clean-cut compared to
the question of Vincent's succession. But in June 1990 she finally managed
to convince her family, as well as herself, that this was the job she had
been seeking all her life.
Now she has managed to solve one of the potential problems (by living near
Nuits-St-Georges rather than Dijon where her engineer-husband works) even if
she has substituted another (her third child is expected in August).
She had for years 'done the vintage' at the Domaine, and even spent the
freezing winter of 1989 in the vineyards there immersing herself in the
all-important soil, as well as forging links with the vineyard staff that
were to stand her in good stead when she came to apply her new methods. 'I
think I am very tied to this village,' she admits with proud resignation.
Even when she took a sabbatical sailing trip round the Caribbean with her
husband and children, she claims, 'all the time I was thinking of the
vines'.
Her rapport with the Domaine's dedicated and reserved winemaker Pierre
Morey, and with Olivier, mean that she can spend a high proportion of her
four days a week in those vineyards - to which has just been added the final
piece in Leflaive's jigsaw puzzle of grands crus, an extremely expensive
pocket handkerchief of the most famous white burgundy vineyard of all, about
a fifth of an acre, or Pounds 600,000 worth, of fully mature vines in Le
Montrachet itself.
'If only Leflaive had some Montrachet,' has long been a refrain of the
world's wine enthusiasts, eager to see the Domaine's incomparably elegant
style of winemaking applied to the greatest vineyard of all. There will not
be much to show - hardly 30 cases of 1991, picked by Anne-Claude and Pierre
Morey themselves last October - but even in a recession they can presumably
expect some help with the interest payments when the wine is finally offered
for sale or, more likely, allocated, at around Pounds 200 a bottle.
I asked how Vincent, who still occupies his vast desk in the Domaine's
handsome first floor office, had reacted to his daughter's conversion to cow
dung, camomile, nettles and the lunar cycle and was surprised to hear 'He is
a hundred times more convinced than I am. I always have a image of my father
sitting outside after dinner looking up at the stars. I think he understands
their language.'
For Anne-Claude the revelation came at a lecture given by the appropriately
named Claude Bourguignon, warning that the soil of Burgundy had become so
worn out by over-application of fertilisers, pesticides and fungicides that
it was effectively nearly dead. Since then she has organised a conference
for fellow Burgundian producers, as well as a pilgrimage to see organic
vineyards such as Huet's in Vouvray.
She is convinced it was the rugged rationality of former maths teacher Noel
Pinguet of Huet that convinced so many of her neighbours that the principles
were sound. They are yet to put them into practice but some, such as
Christophe Roumier of Domaine Georges Roumier and Pascal Marchand at Clos
des Epeneaux are moving in that direction.
Certainly, there is many a Burgundian peasant who still bottles his wine
according the moon and the wind, so the region should be more biodynamically
receptive than, say, Bordeaux where fewer decision-makers actually get their
hands dirty.
It is far too early to be sure of the results of the Leflaive experiment on
a selected two and a half acres, although Anne-Claude notes that the
all-important yield is reduced, the vine leaves and soil already look quite
different and she thinks she can detect more direct flavours in the fruit.
Some Leflaive fans may worry that the famous elegance could be compromised
by this new regime. But, as Simon Loftus points out in his fascinating new
book Puligny-Montrachet (Pounds 19.99 Ebury Press) evolution is inevitable
and we should rejoice in the 'one essential continuum in the history of
Domaine Leflaive, the passion for quality.'
Anne-Claude's medium-term ambition is certainly appropriate to a continuum -
to establish what is literally a co-operative compost heap in Puligny - and
she describes it with real animation: 'Like in the Middle Ages when they
recycled everything. It was fantastic in the Middle Ages, you know, even for
women. I think I should have lived in the Middle Ages.'
Leflaive's white burgundies can be bought, at Pounds 20 (and up) a bottle,
from merchants such as Adnams of Southwold, John Armit of London W11, Corney
&amp; Barrow of EC1 and Lay &amp; Wheeler of Colchester.

FT  09 MAY 92 / Mothers who mourn their lost innocents: Argentina's
'disappeared' children
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BARHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PROMPTLY AT 3.30 every Thursday afternoon in Buenos Aires, a group of ageing
women don white headscarves and begin walking, as they have every week since
1977, anti-clockwise around the monument to Argentina's independence in the
Plaza in front of the Casa Rosada presidential palace.
The military regime responsible for the 'disappearance' of up to 30,000
people may have fallen a decade ago, but the women - known around the world
as the Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo - still gather every week to demand the
truth about their sons, daughters or husbands.
Thursday April 30 was the 15th anniversary of the foundation of the Mothers
of the Plaza de Mayo. Although the Mothers' courage and determination has
made them internationally famous, they still have little to celebrate.
They have only been able to account for 9,000 out of 30,000 believed to have
been 'disappeared' - that chilling euphemism for execution - under the
1976-83 military regime. The guilty remain unpunished: three army mutinies
forced the government to halt prosecutions, so only 39 senior officers were
ever brought to justice. Carlos Menem pardoned them all after becoming
president in 1989.
And perhaps worst of all, the Mothers are becoming irrelevant.
They came together by chance in 1977 after a few women had tried to petition
the junta for information about the missing. They agreed to meet every week
until the disappeared reappeared alive - an act of outstanding courage that
cost three Mothers their lives. To circumvent bans on demonstrations, they
strolled around the Plaza wearing headscarves embroidered with the names of
their missing relatives and the motto 'Truth and Justice'.
Even today they have not given up. Hebe de Bonafini, the group's stout and
energetic founder who lost two sons and a daughter-in-law, says: 'I do not
look for them any more. We are reminding everyone every day of things they
want to forget. We are doing this for the young generation, so that these
events are never repeated.'
But at the Thursday gatherings, most of the people who stop to watch are
passers-by or tourists. Only a few are dedicated supporters who walk with
them around the independence monument. Fewer still are under 40. The Mothers
have blurred into the political landscape. They are usually ignored, except
on special occasions - such as last month - or when one of them gets into
trouble with the authorities.
They hate Menem for freeing the guilty soldiers in the name of national
reconciliation. He loathes the Mothers in equal measure, never losing an
opportunity to attack them: the government is prosecuting de Bonafini for
insulting the presidency by calling Menem 'trash'. The prosecution demands a
five month jail sentence.
The Mothers are still closely watched by the security services and claim,
probably correctly, that their phones are tapped. Their office was burgled
four times last year - unusual for a relatively crime-free city like Buenos
Aires.
Many Argentines agree with Menem, and want to put memories of the 'years of
lead' of the 1970s behind them and look instead to the future: the economy
is booming, and the government promises that sooner or later Argentina will
become a respected member of the first world of rich countries.
However, as the Mothers' literature points out, their 15-year battle has
conclusively proved the 'hypocrisy of the institutions, the perversion of
the system, the prostitution of officials.' Argentina still owes them truth
and justice.
They will only agree to memorials or reparations when all the 30,000 have
been identified or accounted for. That will probably never happen. Yet the
Mothers can draw grim satisfaction from the public's reaction to rare
appearances by stalwarts of the military regime. de Bonafini says that when
Ramon Camps, once the dreaded Buenos Aires police chief, entered a cafe
recently, he was refused service and clients began leaving.
The Mothers' marginalisation is partly their own fault. They are riven by
internal bickering and have split in two factions. One is a moderate,
broad-based group. The other is stridently left wing, attacking Menem as
much for his conservative economic policies as for having pardoned convicted
torturers and murderers.
They still remain active in human rights work. Although democracy was
restored ten years ago, Argentina's police retain a fearsome reputation.
Beatings and torture are common, and summary execution of suspected
criminals is on the rise. Now, as in the 1970s, the courts rarely give
redress.
Perhaps the most remarkable part of their work has been the effort to track
down and recover children born in captivity and given to foster parents
after their mothers were executed. In a few cases, babies were stolen and
their mothers released. Seven infants are known to have been murdered.
A sister organisation, the Grandmothers of the Plaza de Mayo, is dedicated
to finding the grandchildren they have never seen. They have located 50
children, half of whom now live with grandparents or relatives. A further 13
remain with their adoptive families after it was established that the foster
parents had acted in good faith and were not involved in the death of the
child's parents. Five cases remain in the courts.
The Grandmothers have proof that 213 children were kidnapped, which leaves
163 still missing. However, they suspect that far more, probably over 300,
were taken. Miraculously, many of those recovered have grown into
well-balanced teenagers who have come to terms with their traumatic past.
As the Grandmothers themselves say, they are literally working against the
clock. They are storing blood samples that can be used to establish the true
identities of their missing grandchildren through sophisticated biogenetic
testing long after they have died.

FT  09 MAY 92 / Motoring: The Metro's transplant
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STUART MARSHALL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TWO NEW versions of Rover Group's Metro
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
an automatic and a diesel - went on sale this week. They are so good that it
really is high time the car was given a name properly reflecting its status.
Eleven years ago the Austin Mini-Metro was launched as an intended successor
to the already 21-year-old Mini. It was quite successful, not least because
it was the obvious car for Mini owners to trade-up to.
But there were quality and reliability problems. The power train - the
Mini's growly pushrod engine with a 4-speed gearbox buried in its sump - was
past pensionable age. Gradually, people who might otherwise have bought
Metros went in for more up-to-date Ford Fiestas and Nissan Micras, Vauxhall
Novas and VW Polos instead.
Two years ago everything changed. The Metro had a heart and lung transplant.
Out went the geriatric engine and four-speed box. In came Rover Group's
outstandingly efficient K-Series overhead camshaft engine; a new
Peugeot-designed but Rover-made four or five-speed gearbox; and a new
Hydragas suspension.  It was virtually a new car, even though it still
looked much the same as the old one. And build quality had improved beyond
recognition.
From trailing the supermini field, Metro had found its second wind and was
up near the front. Two years on, it is still there, which brings me to its
name. Why not recognise its role as starter model for the Rover marque and
badge it as a Rover 100?
It is already called that on mainland Europe, where they think of a Metro as
an underground train. Giving it the title of Rover 100 in Britain would lay
the Austin ghost and be an honour long overdue.
The five-door Metro 1.4S automatic with an exhaust catalyser which I tried
last month was the best small two-pedal car on the market. Its
Volvo-developed continuously variable transmission (CVT) is much simpler
than a conventional automatic.
I found it quick off the mark and very lively indeed when overtaking. It
romped up steep hills and restarted easily on a 1-in-4 gradient. Finish
inside and out was good, the whole car felt taut, the seats were soft yet
supportive and the ride by far the best in the Metro's size and price class.
It may not be important to those who will buy it as an easy-to-drive
runabout, but it handles beautifully on corners and has all the roadholding
one can safely use. The steering is very light on the move and not
objectionably heavy when parking. Even so, I have to admit there is nothing
quite like power assistance, which is not available on the Metro, for truly
effortless parking and low speed manoeuvring.
Early cars with CVT were odd to drive. When accelerating from a standstill,
their engines raced up to high revolutions and the car's speed rose slowly
in response. But the Metro behaves more like a car with a super-smooth
conventional automatic in which gear changes are undetectable. (The CVT has
no gears at all).
It is very quiet mechanically. At a motorway cruising rate the loudest noise
was the swish of tyres and a fair bit of wind roar from the sunroof.
The CVT is available in seven Metro models from the entry level 1.4L to the
sporty GTa at list prices ranging from Pounds 9,197 to Pounds 12,418. All
have the same performance - a 100 mph (161 kph) maximum and will reach 60
mph (96 kph) from a standstill in just over 11 seconds. Fuel consumption
should be around 38 mpg (7.43 l/100 km) provided you are not leaden-footed
or make only very short journeys.
The new Metro diesel is just as impressive. Its 1.4 litre engine, a PSA
Group product, is used in the Citroen AX and will soon appear in the Peugeot
106. Like the two-pedal version, the Metro diesel is also best in class.
Inevitably, it is throbby at start up and it chuckles loudly when idling.
But on a motorway the diesel Metro is quiet enough to be taken for a petrol
engined car.
Even when accelerating - and its pick up in third and fourth gears in the
important 30-60 mph (48-96 kmh) range is positively vigorous - it sounds
subdued.
The small amount of extra weight up front has no effect on the handling or
ride comfort. It steers easily, too, on the move though inching into a
parking slot is just that much more of an effort.
The Metro diesel comes as a three or five door in two trim levels with a
five-speed gearbox.
Prices start at Pounds 8,509. An economy-minded owner will have no
difficulty in averaging over 60 mpg (4.7 l/100 km).

FT  09 MAY 92 / As they say in Europe: Faraway troubles
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES MORGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'WE'RE not that worried by the war in Bosnia,' said a colleague from
Slovenia the other day, 'After all it's 400km away.' A paradoxical rule of
life, which journalists refuse to accept, is that the greater the distance,
the worse the trouble. There were no anti-Vietnam war demos in southeast
Asia in the 1970s because nobody there cared. In suburban Belfast they say
that strife-torn Shankill is a world away. On the other hand, anxious
parents in London fret for their daughter in Madras when an earthquake hits
the Himalayas.
Confirmation of this came when I tried to make sense of events in Bosnia by
looking at them from just up the road rather than through the British media.
Slovenia's leading daily, Delo, shows that familiarity breeds nonchalance:
it carries less news about the fighting than does the FT. But nonchalance
does not make anything easier to understand, witness the editorial, mainly
about Croatia, in Delo headed 'The forgotten war.'
The writer, Goran Moravcek, does not like Lord Carrington. He 'very often
equates the aggressor with the victim so it is no wonder that Lord
Carrington is still pursuing his catastrophic peace policy. The war in the
states of former Yugoslavia is very probably seen by major western countries
as a local struggle between frenzied tribes who do not know what they are
fighting for.'
Contradictions emerge, not just over poor Lord Carrington, who is expected
to find a peaceful solution when the writer evidently believes there is not
one. The south Slav story is hard enough to follow even without
well-informed observers like Moravcek. He approvingly quotes the statement
of the Croatian leader, Franjo Tudjman, that he is not supplying weapons to
Bosnia, while a paragraph later it is said that vast amounts of material are
flowing from Croatia to Bosnia. Moravcek also asserts that Croatia is in a
position to expel the invaders without outside help, and any external
intervention such as a UN peace force would be counter-productive. A central
figure is the Bosnian President, Alija Izetbegovic. Moravcek maintains he
owes his position to the local Croats - if they had not risen against the
Serbs, he would have been out.
If being more confused means one is better informed, then I had benefitedf
from reading this account. But the Germans would be more helpful, I thought.
After all, they know the Balkans better than the rest of us.
I relied on Die Welt's Vienna-based expert, Carl Gustaf Strohm. From him I
learned that the Bosnian leader has a local critic - 'the President of the
Moslem National Council of the Sandjak, Sulejman Ugljanin.'
This highlights the hitherto unreported row (yes, another one) between the
Moslem population of Bosnia and that of the Moslem enclave in Serbia, the
Sandjak. Ugljanin says he admires the will of Izetbegovic to settle things
peacefully, 'But it is madness to think that all this can resolved in a
peaceful manner.' Maybe the trouble is that 'all this' is a local struggle
between frenzied tribes who do not know what they are fighting for.
Which brings us naturally to the German strikes. The attitude of the press
seemed to harden last week. Writing of the piles of rubbish, Bernhard Blohm,
also in Die Welt, said: 'The strike stinks in the truest sense of the word,
and ever more those struck against, the citizens of this land, are in a
stinking rage over this half-witted strike for a few tenths of one per cent
. . .'
The Suddeutsche Zeitung compared this strike with that of 18 years ago, but
did not share the sense of public 'rage': 'The difference between now and
then is that today the public coffers are empty . . . That means that
citizens will be hit twice by the current strike . . . the one hand there is
the collapse of public services which, so far, has been taken lightly, in an
almost sporting manner. But also the citizens as taxpayers will have to pay
the costs.'
This statement of the obvious appears because it is not obvious in Germany.
So once again, those on the spot often find the affair less dramatic than
observers from afar who are thrilled to bits by the German strikes. As the
Suddeutsche unsportingly points out, there is as yet no chaos in Germany.
*****
Tuesday was an interesting day in the Moscow press. Pravda celebrated its
80th anniversary by making one of its occasional appearances in a special
four page birthday issue. It described the occasion as a 'joyous red letter
day.' And the paper of Moscow city council, Kuranty, wrote about the link
between the Los Angeles riots and Russia which lately, in the US, 'has
become a major source of irritation. This is probably linked with the recent
visit of the deputy prime minister Yegor Gaidar to the USA and the endless
debates on the Dollars 24bn aid to be offered to Moscow . . . The 'not
guilty' (Rodney King verdict) seemed to be the last straw for the American
underclass . . .'

FT  09 MAY 92 / Gardening: For the really serious - Arthur Hellyer reviews
two definitive books for gardeners
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ARTHUR HELLYER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE NEW Royal Horticultural Society Dictionary of Gardening, in four
volumes, has been published. For serious gardeners and students of gardening
this is the most important set of books to appear for a long time, probably
since WJ Bean's Trees and Shrubs Hardy in the British Isles appeared in its
eighth edition between 1970 and 1988.
But between these two great works there is a fundamental difference. Bean's
five volumes were a straightforward revision, updating and enlargement of
something that had been with us for a long time; a familiar friend with much
new material and a considerable alteration of names but nevertheless looking
much like previous editions.
This new RHS work, of which Anthony Huxley is editor-in-chief, Mark
Griffiths, editor, and Margot Levi, managing editor, and on which something
like 250 contributors have been employed, is an entirely new work, not an
update of the old RHS Dictionary of Gardening, which was itself based on
Nicholson's Illustrated Dictionary of Gardening, first published in parts
between 1884 and 1888.
The only things that are familiar are the arrangements in strictly
alphabetical order and similar-sized pages, although the columns of type are
wider.
The old line drawings in the text have disappeared, to be replaced by mainly
whole-page plates of line drawings which are too widely dispersed to do much
to alleviate the very solid appearance of the text.
There are obvious gains that have been obtained from all these points of
difference. First and foremost, there can have been no temptation, in a
drowsy moment, to let old copy slip through unchallenged. Where all is new,
everything must have been considered critically and I would expect this
important work to find a great deal of favour with botanists. It must not go
completely unchallenged for it is the job of taxonomists to examine their
material constantly and to come up with new suggestions for more revealing
or more accurate systems of classification.
Many of the names in the new dictionary are quite different from those in
the volumes they replace and, where they are the same, the descriptions,
although fully botanical like those of the old work, are quite new, which
can sometimes be a bit disconcerting.
But, now that we have "The Plant Finder", not only to tell us where to buy
plants but what names we should be using for them, a great many of these new
names have a degree of familiarity. I am interested to note that Chris
Phillip and Tony Lord, compiler and editor of The Plant Finder, are among
those acknowledged for their usefulness in the editorial forward to the new
RHS Dictionary of Gardening.
I have nothing but commendation for the pains which the editors have taken
to explain how to use the book and what various names mean. It is the
fullest and clearest such explanation I can recollect reading. There has
also been an effort, characteristic of some thinking in the higher ranks of
the RHS at the moment, to rate some plants for hardiness based on a fairly
simple system of zoning, such as that which has been in use in North America
for many years.
There are two hardiness maps, one for North America and the other for
Europe. For the time being, the rest of the world must exist without such
guidance and I do not know that there is very great loss in this, because
hardiness depends upon so many things other than minimum temperatures. The
editors are well aware of this, and the long entry on hardiness is full of
excellent advice.
One advantage of the closely packed pages is that it has been possible to
compress into four volumes what appears to be an even greater amount of
information than that contained in the former five.
There are 3,983 genera and about 50,000 plant entries. 20 pages are devoted
to the history of gardening in the UK - never attempted in the previous work
 -and a further 12 1/2 pages are given to US history. Nearly 150 pages at
the end of volume four are devoted to ancillary matters such as pests,
diseases and disorders; a long horticultural glossary and another on
botanical epithets; an index of all the authors cited in the text; an
extensive bibliography, and an index of popular names which I have already
found useful.
For the next 10 years or so, this is going to be the definitive work, to
which all of us who are not active botanists will turn for the 'correct'
names for each and every plant that we grow, write about or discuss. Not
that any dictionary of plants, however authoritative, can remain completely
unchallenged for long. The speed of increase of knowledge about plants and
the variety of opinions about their relationship to one another has never
been greater than it is today.
There is no doubt that Anthony Huxley and his assistants have done a
wonderful job - one that I would have called impossible if it had been
explained to me at the outset what was proposed. I thought they were
revising the work, not replacing it. The price of the new dictionary is
Pounds 495.
An encyclopaedia of very different character is Blooms of Bressingham Garden
Plants, sub-titled Choosing the Best Hardy Plants for your Garden. It is by
Alan and Adrian Bloom, a father-and-son team; between them they have as good
a knowledge of hardy plants, shrubs and heathers as anyone I know.
Alan, who has been growing and raising good plants all his life, is now 85,
and still tending his famous dell garden near Diss, in Norfolk, as
assiduously as ever.
Adrian has one of the most extensive heather and small conifer gardens in
the UK, only a few hundred yards away from his father's, and they are both
involved in Bressingham Gardens which supplies garden centres all over the
country. They also have a couple of very good centres of their own and do a
big retail trade.
Their encyclopedia is well written, informative, practical, and contains no
strange new botanical names to disturb its readers.
Beautifully produced, with excellent colour pictures, it is a book to
instruct as well as to delight readers and browsers. It costs a reasonable
Pounds 19.99, and is published by Harper Collins.

FT  09 MAY 92 / Gardening: How to beat the hosepipe ban - With the water
table in Britain at a record low and Kent's population already banned form
using hosepipes. Peter Knight looks at ways of keeping the roses blooming,
the lawns green and the vegetables growing
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
TO SAVE that camellia and beat the hosepipe ban, you splash down two flights
of stairs with last night's bath water in a leaking can. Now the bath tub is
scratched, the carpet is wet and your right shoulder hurts. Surely there
must be a better way for you and the garden to survive these greenhouse
summers?
There is. In fact, there are three:
Water less but better.
Catch and store rain water.
Recycle bath and sink water without using buckets.
All these solutions are simple. All could contribute to more beautiful
gardens and reduce water consumption. A garden sprinkler uses as much water
in 30 minutes as a family of four consumes in a day of eating, drinking,
bathing and flushing. This information comes from Thames Water, the company
supplying water to much of London and surrounding areas. Thames has joined
the Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew to produce a guide on how to quench a
garden's thirst without wasting water or damaging the plants.
Kew has cut back drastically on its watering over the past few dry years,
with no harmful effects to its collection. These are its basic tips:
Help the soil to retain moisture by digging-in bulky organic material such
as manure or compost.
Mulch exposed soil with compost, manure, gravel or bark.
Water new plants thoroughly when planting.
Remove weeds regularly; they take moisture and nutrients from the soil.
Water thoroughly but infrequently - this encourages stronger growth.
Ensure that plant species from dry climates are not over-watered.
Use rainwater to supplement the mains supply.
A modest house, or even a garden shed, can catch a surprising amount of
water from the roof - around 12,000 gallons a year from a small house. The
easiest and cheapest way to store it is in a simple plastic butt, available
from garden centres or by mail order for under Pounds 30. None of these
predominantly green tubs is pleasing aesthetically, but they can be hidden
behind a climber or painted to camouflage their presence.
Some garden centres also stock large oak barrels which have been converted
into butts. These cost around Pounds 80 and look a lot better than the
plastic versions. They must never be allowed to dry out and should also get
a yearly coat of oil or wood preservative.
Butts can be placed some distance away from the downpipe by using special
attachments that connect to it and a length of hose. Two of the most popular
are the Rainmate (Pounds 19.95 from Agriframes) and the Rainmiser (Pounds
15.95 from Blackwall). Both are installed as an integral part of the
downpipe, allowing water to flow to the tank but cutting it off when the
butt is full.
A drawback is that a typical butt stores about 45 gallons, which is only a
little more than a sprinkler could consume in about 30 minutes. A number can
be joined by connecting the overflows, although a row of butts can look very
unsightly.
If you have the space and the need, then it might be sensible to buy a big
tank and bury it, say, under the lawn. This might sound rather radical (and
impossible for many town gardens); but as Britain's climate, especially in
the southern part of England, becomes more Mediterranean, it might be
prudent to do what Mediterraneans have been doing for centuries - storing
water underground.
Once the hole has been covered and the lawn restored, the garden will
benefit from a few thousand gallons of rain water stored prudently over the
winter and extracted in the summer with a small electric pump. Tank
stockists are listed under horticultural and farmers' supplies in the Yellow
Pages.
Prices for a 1,000-gallon tank run from about Pounds 300 (second-hand tanks
are about a third of that) without installation. Expect to pay around Pounds
500 for the whole job.
Such tanks are especially useful if you want to store and recycle your bath
and sink water - called grey water - by using it on the garden. This water
might not be suitable for drinking, but it is only slightly murky, and many
plants appear to thrive on a little Fenjal or Fairy Liquid.
There are three main options for recycling grey water; all involve a
reasonably intelligent plumber. A simple solution is to instal a storage
tank in the loft. This is connected to a valve and pump which fills it
automatically when you pull the plug. The tank is connected to your hosepipe
with pressure supplied by gravity. Alternatively, an underground tank could
be filled directly from the bath and sink and the water pumped through the
hose when needed.
It is essential to separate grey and rain water, using different tanks, and
to use grey water quickly. This is because it contains organic matter that
will both spoil the fresh rain water (ideal for pot plants) and cause an
unpleasant smell as it rots. There is also a small risk of disease. .
A more complicated solution is to purify your grey water. While this is
realistic only for very big gardens or hotels, the idea is quite simple and
sensible.
Before being stored, grey water is filtered through sand or reed beds.
Bacteria living on the roots of the reeds eat the organic matter in the
water. Such a purification system can be made a feature of the garden,
disguised as a pond or fountain.
In the UK, there two bureaucratic problems may hinder potential water
recyclers. Water companies claim they 'own' the grey water and that it is
not necessarily ours to recycle. Their main concern is that devious
consumers will simply run the bath tap to fill their storage tanks during a
hosepipe ban.
Also, environmental health officers might be concerned about a DIY water
treatment works being set up in an urban area. It would be wise to check
with the authorities before spending.
Of course, there is a much simpler but more labour-intensive solution for
re-using grey water. Fit a hose connection to the bath drainage pipe before
it joins the sewer. Position your hose, or connect it to a seepage watering
system, and yell for someone to pull the plug.
Mail-order suppliers: Blackwall Products (tel: 081-305-1431) sells water
butts (made from recycled bulk fruit juice containers) and the Rainmiser.
Agriframes (0342-328-644) sells butts and the Rainmate.

FT  09 MAY 92 / Gardening: Westward hoe] In search of new plants and ideas -
Robin Lane Fox loses himself exploring the gardens of the Worcester triangle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBIN LANE FOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GARDENERS are enjoying their best spring for years; everything looks green
and happy; lilacs are already in flower and this years' edition of The Plant
Finder has just come out to join them. To celebrate it, I have taken a break
from preventive poisoning: heading west looking for ideas on what we could
all be growing. Westwards towards Worcestershire, there are ideas by the
dozen, some of which are easier to accommodate than others. Yellow Alyssum
is too harsh for my taste, but there might be possibilities in imitating red
Darwin tulips in grass, while the blossom on the apple trees should cause us
all to regret those which had to be grubbed out soon after we entered the
EC.
Near Malvern, there is the best selection of Michaelmas daisies in any
nursery in the country; at Kingswynford near Kidderminster, there are the
best Lewisias; near Tewkesbury (WHoo in The Plant Finder) there is a list of
admirably grown Alpines within vibration-range of the town's dual
carriageway; they are so fairly priced that most were bought months ago. All
in all, patient plant finders could be lost for days in the
Gloucester-Worcestershire triangle. My taste has learned most from one of my
favourite hunting-grounds, the walled garden and nursery at Stone House
Cottage, Stone, near Kidderminster.
This small nursery is no longer a stranger to connoisseurs. Its mastermind
is Louisa Arbuthnot, and when I wrote about her enterprise six years ago,
the article managed to sing her praises as the skilled keeper of several
thousand pets. The 'pets' should have been 'pots,' but this unsolicited
credit has not stopped the nursery from widening its clientele or the
proprietors from adding a fifth baby to their family. They continue to
propagate, criticise and supply a huge range of plants with a highly
personal labelling system.
The enterprise depends on an exceptionally sharp-eyed wife, a reassuringly
informed husband and no more than one willing assistant. This time I have
returned with young plants of a rare Oriental buddleia, collected by a keen
woman amateur gardener from the Great Wall of China when tourism was still
politically defensible.
A grey-leaved and pink-flowered variety, it has proved quite hardy and ought
to be an apt choice for my own local wall against barbarism: the ancient
city wall of Oxford, which stands in my college gardens.
The nursery supplies visitors only, but I am not trying to tantalise you by
writing merely about a source off the beaten track. Stone House Cottage has
a second string to its bow. The owners planted many of their nursery's plant
in their adjacent walled garden and, as they have lived there for some 20
years, the garden has become a living lesson.
It alerts you to the potential of plants which are otherwise names in a
list, by showing them off at maturity. The setting is not so grand that it
is inimitable.
This weekend, beds at the foot of the walls have white-flowered Bleeding
Heart, the last of the tulips and a rare Blue Eyed Mary which has little
blue flowers starred with white. Pink and yellow Epimediums keep company
with some exceptional rarities, none finer than a plant of Corydalis
Flexuosa. This lovely variety was introduced after an Oriental field-trip
and was already the talks of experts in the lunch-tent at last year's
Chelsea flower show. I now see why. This one plant was smothered in a flock
of crested flowers in an electric shade of blue which outclasses anything
except spring gentians.
Such rarities are beyond most of us, but the shrubs and wall-plants are
another matter. Many of you know or grow the pale yellow flowers of Rose
Canary Bird which is so good in a pot or tub. On Stone House Cottage's wall,
I was attracted once by a deeper and richer variety. It turned out to be
Rose Helen Knight which was bred in the late 1960s and is not related to
Canary Bird at all.
Its parents are a wild yellow rose from Afghanistan, and a plain Scots
Burnet variety. Its breeder, Frank Knight, thought highly of it, but
gardeners have been slower to follow his judgment. If you see a mature
plant, you realise at once that it is a winner. It is located against the
clashing red leaves of a young Pieris in its Worcestershire setting.
Starting from scratch, it would be good in a pot or against a wallat a
height of 5 ft, even in semi-shaded conditions.
Like Rose Canary Bird, the usual forms of Flowering Currant or Ribes are
very well known. One form, however, is more like a flowering gooseberry, the
prickly ribes speciosum. Its crimson-red flowers hang downwards from the
branches and are hardier when trained against a sunny wall. At a flower
show, young plants look ever so slightly boring. At maturity, it is quite
different: after eight years or so, it is looking its best in its
Worcestershire setting.
So has a white-flowered white lilac with a touch of ink-blue to its single
petals. In Oxford's Botanic Garden, Syringa persica alba is trained
vertically up a wall where it flowers very freely. In the walled nursery
garden, this lilac bulges forward at a lower height, not far from tall
pink-flowered Syringa microphylla, one of the great repeat-flowerers in the
family. Together they remind you that large-flowered hybrid lilacs do not
have things all their own way in May.
Established gardens also reassure those of us who are not so far down a new
garden's path. They show you small daphne retusa after 10 years or a
daphniphyllum looking its best; they prove to you that Sycopsis is not just
a suitable name for another dark green shrub with tediously small flowers.
They also show you that one day, too, your own choices will make the grade.
A mainstay of my own newish plantings is the scented white Viburnum
carlcephalum. Since planting it, I have read criticisms of it because it is
less refined than the less vigorous varieties such as Carlesii. Its choice
cost me hours of uncertainty, but I wanted a good grower which could be
pruned gradually into an upright bush like a small standard tree above low
carpets of small hardy plants.
Will the carlcephalum agree to be clipped and grow upwards not outwards?
Books never give the answer, and my young bushes are already bulging
sideways with huge crops of the big scented flowers.
At Stone House Cottage, a much older bush has reached just the height and
shape I have envisaged. Returning home, I have seen a dozen new names at
their mature best, but I have also seen evidence that a bet on the future is
really going to work.

This fine evergreen shrub is known as the Mexican Orange Blossom because its
white, sweetly-scented flowers are somewhat like those of the orange but the
plants are totally unrelated. The leaves are three-parted, very glossy and
aromatic when bruised. The flowers are produced most freely in May and early
June but a few more to appear later in the summer. It makes a
densely-branched bush, 5 ft or more high, but it can be kept smaller by
pruning after flowering. It likes sunny places sheltered from wind.

FT  09 MAY 92 / Sport: When father knows best - Tennis
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BARRETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AS A breed they are by turns villified, appreciated, despised, applauded,
pitied and cursed. Oh yes, and sometimes loved - but never understood and
seldom given the credit for an atom of intelligence. Those among you who are
fathers of teenage daughters will recognise themselves immediately.
It is not easy being a father - particularly when your daughter is just an
ordinary, fun loving multi-millionaire and the main source of family income.
In Rome this week Karoly Seles, whose daughter Monica collects stuffed
animals, and Stefano Capriati, whose daughter Jennifer collects records
(both the 'youngest-ever' and 'pop' variety) have been suffering in the
stands while their breadwinners have battled away on the slow red clay.
When I sat watching the two girls play one another on a cement court in the
quarter-finals of the Lipton event in Key Biscayne, Florida, seven weeks
ago, the two sets of parents - Karoly and Esther, Stefano and Denise - sat
at opposite ends of the court surrounded by the usual entourage of coaches,
trainers, genuine friends and hangers-on.
Before the match I was told by Pavel Slozil, the former Czech Davis Cup
player who used to coach Steffi Graf, that his new charge, Capriati, would
upset the favourite - in spite of the arguments he was having with Stefano
about Jennifer's preparation. How right he was. As the 16-year-old Florida
girl, raking the lines with relentless accuracy, inflicted the first defeat
of 1992 on Seles I exchanged a smile with Slozil. How lucky, I thought, that
Jennifer had the advantage of such sound advice and such an experienced
practice opponent. At the far end Karoly and Esther hid their disappointment
by sportingly applauding Capriati.
The next day Capriati lost decisively to Arantxa Sanchez, a not unexpected
result considering this was Jennifer's first tournament for two months. But
at least she had recovered her zest for the game after debating at the start
of the year (to the family's horror) whether to chuck it all up and resume
her interrupted life as a happy, smiling teenager.
Just two weeks after Key Biscayne, Jennifer lost unexpectedly in Hilton Head
to the Czech Veronika Martinek, ranked 83. That was a bad result. But I'm
sure Slozil did not guess what the result would be for him. Dismissal.
Stefano, who had ended Jennifer's successful association with last year's
coach Tom Gullikson to bring in Slozil four months ago, announced that from
now on he would be in charge of the coaching, and the Florida trainer Laurie
Schuett would be drafted in to work on Jennifer's puppy fat. Like any
corporate chief, Stefano had to slim down his workforce in the middle of a
recession.
Slozil must have been smiling quietly on Thursday when Jennifer suffered
another unexpected defeat in Rome, at the hands of the diminutive
20-year-old South African, Amanda Coetzer, ranked 31. As Stefano is
discovering, the pit of parental pain is bottomless.
Meanwhile, the irrepressible Seles had bounced back to break another record.
By winning the Spanish Open two weeks ago in Barcelona, to claim her 25th
career title at 18 years and four months, four months younger than Tracy
Austin had been in 1981 when the American reached her quarter century. This
was only Monica's 49th tournament whereas it took Austin 71. I hope Karoly
bought her another cuddly toy to add to the collection.
Chris Evert (another former child prodigy hand-reared by her father) had
played one more tournament than Seles when she won her 25th title, and was a
full nine months older, while Steffi Graf (also father figured) was eight
months older and playing her 78th tournament when she passed the same
milestone. Seles's 25 titles took only 217 matches, an average of 8.68
matches per title. Evert's 157 career wins averaged 9.26 matches,
Navratilova's average for her 159 successes is 9.54 and Graf's is 9.6 for 63
wins.
Whichever way you look at it, Seles is the best player to emerge in the era
of Open tennis. She was the youngest winner of a Grand Slam crown in modern
times when she beat Graf in Paris in 1990 at the age of 16 years six months
(true, Lottie Dod was 15 years 10 months when she won at Wimbledon in 1887
but there were only five challengers that year); she won four Grand Slams in
her first nine attempts (Evert's fourth came at her 13th attempt, Graf's at
her 17th); and last year, aged 17 years 11 months, Monica became the
youngest-ever World Champion.
Although Karoly is nominally Monica's coach, all the ground work was done by
Nick Bollettieri at his Academy in Bradenton, Florida. He helped the family
to emigrate from Yugoslavia after spotting Monica as a 10 year old at the
old Sport Goofy event in Orlando. After investing years of time, money and
effort in honing her talents and protecting her from too much competition
too soon, he was shocked and hurt to be cast aside without a word of thanks.
Perhaps Nick should engage Slozil as an extra father figure to hit with the
latest prodigy he is developing at Bradenton (yes there is one, but I have
promised him not to divulge her name). Then they could both suffer as all
fathers should.

FT  09 MAY 92 / Sport: Pakistan opens without the master of the late
entrance - Cricket
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERESA MCLEAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FORTUNE WAS against me when it sent Imran Khan to Oxford University in 1973,
the year after I had left. Although I enjoyed many a happy hour watching
cricket in the Parks, I only saw Imran later, when the county circuit
brought him nearby, playing sadly for Worcestershire, drinking milk and
hating the pub evenings that are the heart of most cricketers' social lives.
I did not see him play for Pakistan until 1982, when he brought them on a
short tour of England. Imran is an easy man to miss. So easy that one is
tempted to conclude that managing his absences ranks among his most astute
cricketing skills.
No-one knows better than Imran when to make people miss him, miss him so
much that he has no alternative but to return in a blaze of glory because
his country cannot go on without him. His captaincy is not especially
exciting or enterprising, but it is strong. When Imran made his debut as
captain of Pakistan 10 years ago, Pakistan lost the three-Test series 2-1,
but came away triumphantly because they had won Pakistan's first Test
victory at Lords. Imran followed that up with crushing defeats of Australia,
where his leg-spinning protege Abdul Qadir fatally mesmerised the batsmen,
and then of India. Only a stress fracture of the shin removed him from power
for the next couple of years.
I suppose it was only that.
First Zaheer Abbas, then Javed Miandad took over the leadership when Imran
had to drop out in late 1983, but in early 1984 the selectors were sacked
because they had preferred Javed to the unfit Imran as captain in Australia,
to nationwide dismay.
Imran was declared captain although he could not bowl at all and could only
play a bit, cautiously, in the fourth Test. The crack in his shin kept
opening and closing. He said it might well be the end of his Test career.
By late 1985 he was back, after Javed's aggressive captaincy had provoked
complaints, from Pakistan's players and opponents alike. Imran then led
Pakistan through a drawn series against the West Indies and a victorious one
against the old rivals, India, which saw the team welcomed home as national
heroes and Imran as a phoenix deserving of endless adulation.
Instances of Imran reluctantly returning to power are too numerous to list,
the latest and most spectacular being the World Cup. But they illustrate a
principle worth remembering, now that Pakistan are here for a gruelling 15
week tour, with 34 matches, including five Test and five Texaco one-day
internationals. This is ideal waiting ground for Imran. He is nursing his
sore shoulder, watching and waiting.
Anyone lucky enough to be at Worcester could testify to the glorious
ferocity of Pakistan's batting attack, as Ramiz Raja and Salim Malik tore
the bowling apart on Wednesday, and also to its volatile nature: on Friday
they were all out for 93 in the second innings. Aamir Sohail had a less than
memorable match, but he is a difficult character who makes his presence felt
in every game in which he plays. Wicket-keeper Moin Khan is another fiery,
disruptive element.
In a long tour, after a hard but victorious World Cup with a month's
unremitting celebrations afterwards, the problem is going to be keeping up
the team's momentum and keeping its players together as a team. A set of
meteoric personalities like these is liable to crack into factions under
pressure.
Javed, Pakistan's captain, is a great fighter and an insatiable competitor,
but he is not a man to ease pressure or, I think, to use it to best
advantage, which is one of Imran's strengths.
If they confront it right, the Pakistanis thrive on adversity. Sometimes it
is almost as if they get into trouble on purpose, so they can come out of it
all the more sensationally.
'Forget all these worries about no-balls and wides and just go and fight,'
Imran told his troops three games before the World Cup final, with three
wins needed to qualify. They qualified and won. If Javed can keep all the
fighting directed against the enemy, he has some players of fearsome talent
at his disposal.
England's best policy is probably to 'try and stay cool', as Gooch put it
when asked last summer how he helped his team face ferocious West Indian
bowling bombardments. You would not find either Imran or Javed telling the
Pakistani Tigers to try and stay cool, but they would find it frustrating if
the enemy stays cool.
In Karachi, where Javed comes from, cricket is battle, and if the game
itself fails to generate enough crackle, I would not be surprised to see him
get himself involved in some sort of trouble associated with the game. This
would be a sad second best.
Pakistan are disappointed that England are using English umpires for this
tour, though they have accepted the fact. This position, which has a certain
ironic tinge to it, is a possible source of trouble under pressure, as is
the over-crowded schedule crammed with one-day matches, England's desire for
revenge after the World Cup, Pakistan's desire to complete their humiliation
of colonial England and, of course, the ever-present tensions of Pakistani
cricket politics.
Whether or not Javed and Imran end up playing this tour as a double act, it
should be an exciting one to watch. Wasim Akram of Lancashire, Salim Malik
of Essex and the injured Waqar Younis of Surrey have enough experience of
English teams and conditions to give useful advice, though of course that
can become too much of a good thing.
Intikhab Alam, Pakistan's manager, with 12 popular years of leg-spin bowling
and muscular batting for Surrey behind him (1969-1981), will have to handle
that carefully. He should be a good man to help bring young Mushtaq Ahmed's
bowling of wrist spin, leg-spin, googlies and flippers to its best.
And of course there is always Imran. The man who first spotted and fostered
the talent of Wasim and Waqar; who picked Mushtaq as a worthy successor to
the magical Qadir, another of his discoveries, and has declared the dynamic
22 year-old batsman Inzamam-ul-Haq to be a genius. Who dare argue? Imran has
an expert knowledge of cricket. He loves being in command; indeed, some say
he was born to be in command. I wonder what odds are being offered on
whether Imran will emerge from retirement this summer, for the very last
time, to show his players how to play and win, even when it is impossible.

THE sounds of approval that greeted the victory by Sandy Lyle in the Italian
Open last Sunday could be heard from Land's End to John O'Groats. Lyle may
be the most popular professional golfer on the European tour, One who does
what he says he will do, never forgets a friend though a face might
sometimes escape him. He remains impressively consistent, whether in victory
or in defeat.
Lyle is more than just the most popular of men. He may be the most naturally
gifted player, more so than Nick Faldo, Bernhard Langer, even than Ian
Woosnam. He was an infant prodigy who was making sweet music with his golf
clubs at an extraordinarily early age. At three, when he could comfortably
pass underneath the handle of a trolley, he was able to hit a golf ball 100
yards or so with his teeny-weeny clubs.
Alexander Walter Barr Lyle is a Shropshire lad who was born in Shrewsbury
and grew up in the picture postcard village of Weston-under- Penyard. It is
a forgotten area, which time seems to have passed by, down just off the
Whitchurch-Shrewsbury road. There were trees to climb, caves to explore, a
church with a lych gate. Mostly, though, he played golf.
He was fat as a child and his nickname was Podge. Therein lies the root of
his erratic and ungainly backswing. It was the only way he could get the
club around his stomach. In his early teens he contracted German measles and
retired to bed for three weeks. While in bed he grew three inches and lost
two stone. Although he was no longer a fat boy, he retained his eccentric
backswing.
There are many stories about Lyle. My own favourite tells you something
about him. I am sure it is apocryphal but if you promise not to tell anyone,
then I will repeat it.
In 1988 on the night of the third round of the US Masters, a couple of
mischievous journalists came upon Sandy's enormous shoes in the clubhouse at
Augusta. One of the journalists scribbled a note on a piece of paper and
slipped in to Lyle's shoe. 'This is your left shoe, Sandy,' it said.
The next day Lyle marched to victory, a victory that was marked by his
fantastic bunker shot on the 18th. At the end of the round he removed his
left shoe, found the piece of paper inside it and said: 'I wondered what
that was.'
In 1985 Lyle became the first Briton since Tony Jacklin in 1969 to win the
Open. It is typical of him that the next day a marquee was erected in the
garden of his home at Wentworth and friends and journalists were invited
round. Sandy washed the dishes in the kitchen. That is Sandy Lyle for you:
Open champion one day, kitchen skivvy the next.
In 1987 I began to write a book with Dave Musgrove, Lyle's caddie. The idea
had been suggested several years earlier but Christine Lyle, who was Sandy's
wife, put her foot down.
By 1987, Lyle's marriage had ended and all barriers to our book had
therefore been withdrawn. I started work immediately. It was a memorable
experience for two reasons. The first was that it allowed me to get to know
Musgrove better. A man with a saying for every day of the month, he became a
friend, a guide through the sometimes superficial world of professional
golf.
While writing the book I gained an insight in to the core of the
professional tour. And I lost count of the number of flattering comments
Dave made about his boss, and the perks that came Musgrove's way, courtesy
of Lyle, from first-class air flights to five-star accommodation.
'Sandy is the best bloke in the world to caddie for' Musgrove said at the
time. 'My wages must be the best on tour and when I stay at his home at
Wentworth he brings me tea in the morning.'
In 1989 Lyle returned to Augusta to defend his US Masters title. With him
was his father Alex and his mother Agnes. Walking around watching an
obviously out-of-form Sandy was taxing for Lyle senior. He could not make
out what was wrong. One minute Lyle would whistle out an enormous drive and
fluff the second shot, the next he would three-putt.
'You know what pleases me most, more than seeing Sandy win championships?'
asked Alex.
'It is seeing the respect Sandy is held in by his fellow professionals.
Every one has a word for him. That makes me very proud.'
No more than the the rest of the golf world is of his son. Welcome back
Sandy.

FT  09 MAY 92 / Sport: High noon on the high seas - America's Cup
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEITH WHEATLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EVERY SPORT needs a baddie. Right now billionaire yachtsman Bill Koch is
fulfilling the role perfectly for the America's Cup. Koch used dollars
(around Dollars 75m of them) and science to eliminate veteran helmsman
Dennis Conner from the chance to once more defend the Cup for the US. Today
Koch races the Italian challenger Il Moro in the first of a best-of seven
series.
'The Kanza Indians have a saying that the greatness of your tribe is
determined by the greatness of your enemy,' says Koch, whose family hail
from Wichita, Kansas. 'We think Dennis Conner is probably the greatest
sailor that's ever been, so we're ecstatic to have beaten him to get to this
point.
'I would attribute all our success here to Dennis pushing the hell out of
us. We have made some technical innovations in the past month which we
wouldn't have made had there not been this level of competition.'
Nevertheless, a straw poll in the last few days by the Los Angeles Times
among knowledgeable Cup observers failed to find a single one who thought
that Koch would triumph and sailing's oldest trophy would stay in America.
Their confidence in Il Moro's chances stems largely from the Italian yacht's
breathtaking feat in coming from 1-4 down against the Kiwi favourites to win
the challenger series 5-4. Skipper Paul Cayard was almost alone in still
believing he could best the New Zealand sailing machine. Back at the Il Moro
base his shore crew were already breaking camp for the trip back to Venice.
By using the pressure from the bowsprit controversy Cayard was able to break
the Kiwis, particularly skipper Rod Davis, pyschologically. Everyone
involved with Cayard refers to the 32-year-old's enormous mental strength -
combined with an intuitive sailing flair which makes him Conner's natural
heir.
It is a potent combination to pit against a cumbersome America3 brains'
trust which Koch is skipper and steers once the boat is ahead, Olympic gold
medallist Buddy Melges, 62, steers the tricky legs, and starting helmsman
Dave Dellenbaugh looks after the aggressive pre-gun manoeuvres.
Do they have trouble making decisions? 'Sometimes yes, sometimes no,' laughs
the delightful Melges. Like Conner he grew up near the water, talking his
way aboard the boat of anybody who would give him a crew job. His father was
a boat-builder and Melges sailed solo at the age of six on Lake Geneva,
Wisconsin.
'We weren't well-to-do,' recalled Melges. 'I couldn't afford a bike until I
was in high school. Sailing to me was a form of transportation. I'd sail
over to a friend's house and then we'd race back to mine for supper.'
He has moved into a different world now. Il Moro has a counterpart to Koch
in financier Raul Gardini. The two men have a great deal in common. Both
syndicate leaders have inherited sums in the region of Dollars 500m from
family businesses and both have used lawyers to secure the money from their
nearest and dearest.
They have lavished similar amounts on their Cup campaigns and both are
former maxi-yacht world champions. Where they differ is in their attitude to
sailing. Koch has a hands-on approach, asking why he should pay for another
helmsman's ego trip; whereas Gardini prefers to be the paying passenger.
He often occupies the spot aboard the IACC yachts reserved for the 17th  -
non-participatory - man. Cayard refers to Gardini as 'the man who looks as
if he is on fire', a reference to the boss's two-packs-per-race cigarette
habit. There is no love lost between the two owners.
'Raul spent five to 10 times what I did on his maxi-yacht and I still beat
him,' said Koch. 'And I look forward to beating him again.' Koch's maxi
Matador2, world champion in 1990 and '91, was the product of five year's
research and a testament to her owner's faith in science, rather than art,
making boats go fast.
To become defender of international sport's oldest trophy Koch has formed a
huge team, dominated by technology rather than sailors. More than half the
175 people on the America3 payroll are scientists.
'We are based on two principles,' says Koch. 'Science prevails over art in
terms of achieving boatspeed and teamwork prevails over egotism.'
Predictions about who will win the America's Cup are thicker in the air than
LA smog. Rod Davis, skipper of New Zealand's beaten challenger, is adamant
that the Cup is bound for Italy. 'I haven't decided whether it's going to be
4-1 or 4-0 yet,' he said.
'But I think Il Moro is going to give America3 a pretty good thrashing.'
Dennis Conner, beaten by more than five minutes by America3 in the last race
of the defender trials, tends to the opposite view. 'Koch's yacht is a heck
of a good boat,' says the helmsman who hasn't been dumped from an America's
Cup since 1974. 'If they can sail it, we'll win.'
Since the two boats have yet to meet head-to-head the form book is
non-existent. Yet computer analyses from the dozens of races in the two sets
of elimination trials suggest that America3 is marginally faster - about 1m
32s around the 20-mile course.
However, if it were settled on the quality of invective one might feel that
Gardini is already 3-0 up and ahead in the fourth race.
'I see Koch has suggested a new regulation where the owner has to steer
sometimes,' says Gardini. 'It would be a silly rule if we all steered like
he does. The only time we raced together directly, he lost.'
Whether the Cup comes to Europe or is successfully defended in California,
one name is already on the board for 1995. Dennis 'don't look back' Conner
is even now stalking America's boardrooms, and has sponsors in place.
'I'll be back, stronger than I was this year,' predicts the maestro. 'I've
had worse defeats. Heck, I lost the thing in 1983 and it turned out to be
the best thing that ever happened to the event. It put the cup and Dennis
Conner on the map.'

FT  09 MAY 92 / Minding Your Own Business: Old craft in a modern setting -
Nick Garnett visits Brian Stack, who combines his culture with his business
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICK GARNETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DINGLE Peninsula is the western terminus of Europe, the final outpost
before you fall into the Gulf Stream. On a sunny day in April, the water is
pastel blue and the Brandon mountains are capped in snow. An ordnance survey
map reveals the strata of primitive cultures that once took root here: the
weird beehive huts of early Christian hermits; the monastic life exposed by
the lonely Gallarus oratory shaped like an upturned boat; the crooked Ogham
stones of the late Iron Age on which the Celts chiselled a simple structure
of angled lines as a written script.
The area around the coastal town of Dingle is also a gaeltacht. It is one of
10 or so parcels of land in Ireland where the populations encapsulate a
significant proportion of fluent Gaelic speakers. Special attention is cast
on them, with the help of a Udaras (Gaelic for 'authority'), whose task
includes funnelling cash to businesses.
The regional manager for the Udaras in Dingle, Steve O Culain, says it is
illegal to discriminate against businesses run by non-Gaelic speakers, but
the Udaras clearly prefers using money in a way that bolsters Ireland's
ancient language.
One tiny company benefiting from operating in a gaeltacht is that of Brian
Stack, jewellery-maker and jewellery-seller. But he benefits more from
operating in a beautiful area popular with tourists. Visitors account for 65
per cent of Stack's total yearly sales of Pounds 180,000, largely because
the 40-year-old has piggy-backed his business on two local attractions.
One is the artefacts left by the Celts, such as the Ogham stones, high
crosses and metalware.
'A lot of the interlace work in the seventh and eighth centuries was
incredible,' says Stack. 'There is a theory that these workmen had proper
workshops and a type of college system to learn crafts in gold, silver and
stone.'
Stack and his workshop reproduce miniature examples of Celtic art in gold
and silver.
The other attraction is Fungie, a dolphin which popped up in the sea off
Dingle five years ago and has stayed ever since. Fungie has become an
attraction for tourists, who also like Stack's gold and silver facsimiles of
the cute cetacean.
Stack did a seven-year jeweller's apprenticeship in Cork before working in
Canada and building his own house in Dingle. He rented his first shop in
Dingle in 1981, opened another outside the peninsula in the tourist haunt of
Killarney, and then a workshop in Dingle. He has just moved the workshop to
a new, larger building, with a shop attached, provided by the Udaras.
About half the jewellery Stack sells is bought from other jewellery-makers,
though he expects this proportion to drop. 'The margin on made-up jewellery
we buy is about 100 per cent and a little more on the things we make, say,
130 per cent,' he says.
The workshop and three retail outlets generated a profit last year of
between Pounds 20,000 and Pounds 30,000. Stack employs three in the shops
(and gets occasional help from his wife, Mairead, a teacher) and four
apprentices. Training grants from the Udaras cover 60 per cent of
apprentices' wages for the first year, and after that on a declining scale.
The Udaras also forks out for 60 per cent of capital equipment. This
includes Pounds 20,000 of casting machinery, bought because the economics of
jewellery-making work against handcrafting.
Much of Stack's own jewellery is handmade: gold and silver bent, soldered,
cut and punched into shape. To lower the costs, more jewellery will now be
made by casting. The rubber cast is taken by a handmade design, and wax
injected into it. The wax pieces are fixed to a common stem and plaster is
poured around that. The wax is removed by steam, and silver or gold poured
into the mould - aA vacuum system sucks the metal into the mould's furthest
corners.
There is plenty of space for all this in the 155 sq metre premises, whose
subsidised rent is about Pounds 1,200 a year, rising eventually to an
unsubsidised rent of about Pounds 3,000. The casting equipment comes from
the Isle of Wight, precious metal from Johnson Matthey in Dublin, and
gemstones from London and Switzerland.
Some of Stack's headaches are familiar to most owners of small businesses.
'We have built up gradually over ten years, which is a good thing, but my
biggest problem is I never got management training of any description. That
would have helped with things like controlling stock, forward planning, and
understanding how to foresee demand.'
Seasonal demand and the need to build up stocks every year for the summer
tourist sales hurts cash flow.
'By the beginning of the next season, you are in a tight squeeze on that.
We'll be producing more with the casting machines, so to counteract these
new cash flow pressures we intend to take on work for other jewellers.'
He intends reducing the number of different items the company makes. Stack
uses a Pounds 20,000 overdraft from Allied Irish Bank.
The troubles in the North still have a debilitating effect on tourism, and
remain, for businessmen like Stack, a source of annoyance and bewilderment.
'It's the great tragedy of Ireland. It hampers everything, shifting all
development right down the line. It's such a mess.'
Like most of his fellow countrymen, Stack harbours a relatively genial
disposition on life. 'I've been very lucky, thanks be to God.'

Green St, Dingle, Co Kerry) Republic of Ireland. 010-353-66-51298.

FT  09 MAY 92 / Minding Your Own Business: A cheap, cheerful integrated
package - Computing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID CARTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MANY PC users find that the best software to run on their computer is an
'integrated' package. This combines into one the three most common
applications - word processing, spreadsheet and database - and is invariably
a much cheaper solution than buying the three of them separately. There is a
further advantage in that all the applications are designed to operate in
the same way: once you have mastered one you are half way to mastering the
other two. Office Manager is perhaps the cheapest integrated package on the
market. It was released in 1989 and combines a word processor, spreadsheet
and simple database and will run on floppy or hard disk machines. It is
available from Software Toolworks (0444-246333) at Pounds 51.08 including
VAT, and by a special mail order offer from PC Answers magazine at only
Pounds 19.97.
Under the influence of the marketing department most packages these days
come overloaded and complicated with masses of irrelevant features: working
your way through them is a struggle. Office Manager, by contrast, shows the
influence of the engineer who tries to come up with a simple design that
contains the essentials and nothing else. At the beginning you have a quick
look through the menu options and think: 'Is that all? Surely there's got to
be more to it than this.' But then you put the package through its paces and
all the really important things you need are there sure enough. Office
Manager may be cheap, but in design terms it is bang up-to-date. It adopts
IBM's CUA (Common User Access) style that is becoming industry standard. Hit
the Alt key and you activate drop-down menus from a menu bar at the top of
the screen. It supports a mouse and the HP laserjet printer.
Initial impressions are good. The opening screen presents a neat list of the
files available in each application.
I chose the word processor. Up came an attractive white screen with red
margins. For the typical business user who needs to write letters and memos
this word processor is excellent - clear menus, easy editing, and adequate
layout facilities. For anyone who writes in foreign languages it offers a
simple way of including non-standard characters such as umlauts and
circumflexes. It can also link to the database module for 'mailmerge', the
facility to print personalised standard letters.
The 'Calc' spreadsheet module is again simple and clean, but the lack of a
tutorial created a few difficulties. It took me some while to work out the
exact sequence for copying one cell to a group of other cells. The Help key
(F1) in the spreadsheet was corrupted in my copy and locked up the keyboard,
so I had to switch off and restart. Formatting options are limited; you
cannot display a figure as a percentage and I could not find a way of
centring the contents of one cell.
Another weakness is that Office Manager is only set to print 10 characters
per inch on to the paper. This is unlikely to be a problem with the word
processor but in a spreadsheet you really need condensed print at 17 cpi to
squeeze a year's figures onto one page. For Office Manager to print in other
sizes - such as 12 cpi or 17 cpi - you have to enter printer escape codes.
The database module ('Filer') is the least successful. With most packages
designing a database is usually easy, because you simply 'paint' the data
entry form on the screen. I tried to set up a mailing list database but
found it a struggle.
Office Manager's manual is clear and well written, but is no substitute for
a brief tutorial taking you through worked examples and illustrating how
everything hangs together.
Another problem is that 'date ' and 'telephone' fields only accept US
formats (eg April 17 1992 appears as 4/17/92). Once you have got over all
these hurdles, data entry is easy, and I found the report writer clear and
easy to use, but at the beginning users will have to struggle unnecessarily.
None of the above defects is insuperable. On the credit side, Office
Manager's word processor is excellent, its spreadsheet perfectly adequate.
Overall design is admirably clear and logical, and for the beginner or
occasional user this package is is a top recommendation irrespective of
price. At less than Pounds 20, what have you got to lose?
Office Manager is available at the special price of Pounds 19.97 including
VAT, from PC Answers magazine, Future Publishing Ltd, order ref. PCA913,

FT  09 MAY 92 / Briefcase, Q &amp; A: Woodland in trust
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MY WIFE and I plan to make a deed of gift so that on our deaths about 20
acres of natural woodland passes to a local wildlife trust. We would like
the woodland to be maintained by the trust in its natural state and would
like to include a clause in the deed of gift to the effect that, if the
trust should sell the land, then the proceeds would go to three or four
charities equally, but none of the proceeds of the sale would go to the
wildlife trust.
Our solicitor tells us (but we do not believe him) that we cannot include
such a clause when we make a gift of this nature.
You could achieve your objective by a more elaborate provision, namely
setting up a trust for the use of the wildlife trust so long as the land is
retained in its natural state, with a gift over to the other charities if
the land ceases to be so maintained.

FT  09 MAY 92 / Briefcase, Q &amp; A: When can I gross up?
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
SINCE 1981-82 I have included income from Guaranteed Income Bonds in my tax
return, and they have always been dealt with as 'Chargeable Events': ie they
have not been 'grossed up' for purposes of calculating higher rate tax. I
have before me a cutting from Weekend FT of June 23 1990 in which John
Edwards wrote that, unlike building society interest, guaranteed income
bonds were not grossed up for calculating the higher rate.
In my assessment from the Norwich Tax Office for 1989-90, they grossed up
this income, but on appeal they amended it without question. For 1990-91
however, they grossed this income up again and on appeal they are refusing
to amend it, saying it must be grossed up.
What is the true position?
Your appeal may be being dealt with by a junior inspector who has not been
adequately trained. Point out to him (or her) that there are no grossing-up
provisions in sections 541(1) and 547(1)(a) &amp; (5) of the Income and
Corporation Taxes Act 1988.
If by chance you have any more trouble on this point, write to the District
Inspector (whose name will be at the top of the letter from the junior
inspector), asking him or her to transfer your file to one of his or her
assistants who is more familiar with the relevant sections of the Taxes Act.

FT  09 MAY 92 / Briefcase, Q &amp; A: A loan to daughter but not her boyfriend
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
YOU recently mentioned the advisability of some form of agreement where one
member of a family makes a loan to another. I am faced with a similar
problem, but with a variation.
My daughter has asked for assistance in finding a substantial deposit to buy
a house. The mortgage will be in her name as the owner, and she will be
responsible for repayments. She intends to take in her current boyfriend as
a paying guest. I have read that if the relationship splits up, her friend
could make a claim for a share of the property. Under these circumstances,
would it be better for me to take part ownership in the property in order to
protect my investment?
She is of the opinion that in order to protect her ownership of the property
all she has to do is to get her boyfriend to sign a document to the effect
that he is only a tenant and has no claim on the property. To this end,
would it be adviseable for her to issue the boyfriend with a rent book?
What your daughter proposes will not be effective unless she enters into a
proper lease, eg a shorthold tenancy, with her boyfriend. It is important to
ensure that the lease is in a form which will not give the tenant security
of tenure.

FT  09 MAY 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: A helping hand with charges
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HOW MUCH do you pay when you take out a personal pension? Up to a third of
your final fund could be eaten up in charges, according to Pensionline, an
independent financial adviser.
Most of those who sell personal pensions receive a commission for doing so.
This reduces the benefits provided by the policy and can influence the
salesman's judgment.
Pensionline is offering a new service which, in return for a fee of Pounds
245, will reinvest all commission income in the policy.
The table shows the difference reinvesting commission can make. It covers
regular premium unit-linked policies with a 25 year term. Companies covered
are those which have five years experience of unit-linked managed funds and
which will allow Pensionline to reinvest the commission.
To take Scottish Life as an example, its standard charges would reduce the
pension fund on retirement by 18.38 per cent. But if commission were
reinvested, the reduction would be only 11.18 per cent. That would make
Scottish Life the cheapest provider of those surveyed.
Some companies have substantially higher charges than those shown. The
charges of Liberty Life, NEL Britannia and Confederation Life would eat up
30 per cent of your pension fund, and at Gresham Life the charge is 35 per
cent.
But charges are not the only thing that matters; performance is important.
There are 57 companies with unit-linked performance records lasting five
years, and Scottish Life ranks 40th among them.
Pensionline has accordingly sought out those companies which have relatively
low charges and a good performance. These are highlighted in bold. Sun Life,
for example, is seventh in performance terms and third on charges.
Different companies come out best, depending on the type of policy surveyed.
In the field of five year unit-linked single premiums (where charges are
generally lower), Pensionline highlights Eagle Star, Scottish Widows and
National Mutual.
This combination of charges and performance can make an enormous difference.
If Sun Life were to maintain a 13 per cent growth rate and 12 per cent
charges for 25 years, then the fund value of a Pounds 100 per month policy
would be Pounds 197,744. If Save &amp; Prosper were to maintain a 10 per cent
growth rate and 17 per cent charges (after reinvestment), the same fund
would be worth only Pounds 110,127.
The commission reinvestment option is very likely to save you money, even
allowing for Pensionline's fee, unless you are investing under Pounds 100 a
month for a short period.
This combination of intelligent analysis of charges and rebating commission
would seem to meet the demand for 'best advice' imposed by the Financial
Services Act. The Pensionline service is thus a very encouraging
development.

FT  09 MAY 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Flexible friends face hard times in
recession - How to ..choose a credit card
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
THE HEYDAY of the credit card may have passed. The recession and a rise in
personal debts have made many people turn their backs on these plastic
pieces of temptation. The recession has also hit the card issuers. It now
appears that bankers priced their credit card services too low in the fight
to enter the market, and the credit card income of the banks has dropped.
So, interest charges have risen and annual fees have been introduced. These
measures have led to fewer customers: Lloyds, the first bank to introduce
credit card charges, is believed to have only 1.6m Access cardholders
compared with about 2.8m two years ago. Further changes are likely. At the
beginning of 1992, Barclaycard predicted that smaller credit card issuers
would be squeezed out of the market, with some cards being sold to larger
issuers and others disappearing. If you do not have a credit card, you may
find it harder to get one now than a few years ago. 'There was a time when
we would not think twice about issuing a credit card to someone who worked
in the City,' said a spokesperson for one UK bank. 'But we know that these
jobs are no longer secure and our preferred customers today are more likely
to be doctors than bankers.'
The type of card you choose is likely to fall into two broad areas - a
straightforward credit card, or a 'gold' or 'charge' card.
'ORDINARY' CREDIT CARDS
Prompt payers
These are the cards that people are likely to obtain from their bank or
building society.
Two dominate the market. There were 17.6m Visa cards and 12.3m
Mastercard/Access in issue in 1990, according to Mintel, which expects
figures for 1991 to show a fall because of the introduction of fees.
Barclays and TSB were the original issuers of the Visa card in the 1960s.
For this reason these banks have been able to market their Visa cards under
brand names - Barclaycard and TSB Trustcard.
Access is a UK MasterCard subsidiary brand name jointly owned by National
Westminster, Midland, Lloyds and Royal Bank of Scotland.
The cheapest and best way to use a credit card was revealed by Nigel Lawson,
former Chancellor of the Exchequer, who advised people to pay off their
monthly bill in full. This is a convenient form of payment and gives the
user a period of interest-free credit, in addition to some perks.
However, for many card holders the credit is no longer free because of the
annual fees. The Big Four banks now all charge an annual fee of up to Pounds
12, although free cards are still available from some issuers, such as the
Co-operative bank, Girobank, National &amp; Provincial and TSB.
Late payers
Many people begin with good intentions but, when faced with the choice of
paying only Pounds 5 rather than, say, Pounds 500 for the month, opt for the
former and soon slide into debt. If this is you, one of the most important
criteria will be the rate of interest being levied.
This is usually measured by the APR, or annual percentage rate.
Unfortunately this is becoming unreliable as a basis of strict comparison
because of the different assumptions made by card issuers in their
calculations (the date at which they begin to charge interest and the amount
of credit they assume is outstanding) and because of the fees.
If a card issuer chooses a large sum as a typical credit limit over which to
spread the fee, its APR will look smaller than another issuer spreading the
same amount over a smaller sum. For example, the Bank of Scotland and
Clydesdale bank both have a Pounds 10 annual fee and a 1.9 per cent monthly
interest charge, yet Bank of Scotland gives its APR as 26 per cent while
Clydesdale quotes 26.6 per cent.
However, the difference is not likely to be much more than a percentage
point and according to Paul Hersey, senior finance analyst at Mintel, 'the
APR is still the best figure because it shows you the overall cost of credit
for the year.' Alternatively, you can look at the monthly figure and the
size of the fee as a basis for comparison.
In its last survey of credit cards, Which?, the Consumer Association's
monthly magazine, found that the Bank of Cyprus Visa card, with 19.6 per
cent APR, and National and Provincial's Visa (24 per cent APR) and no annual
fee offered the cheapest credit.
Apart from the APR, your credit limit and perks are other considerations.
Perks
One of the more irritating aspects of opening the monthly bill is the
paraphernalia that drops out of the envelope advertising credit card perks.
Which? points out that many of these are little more than a way of marketing
associated products, such as discounts on holidays offered by the issuer.
Some perks are inbuilt no matter what sort of ordinary credit card you hold.
Under the Consumer Credit Act, all card issuers have to give you protection
against faulty goods if the supplier does not compensate you. If your card
is stolen and you have notified the issuer, you will not be liable for goods
purchased subsequently with the card. Credit cards also give some degree of
travel insurance, although this is not a substitute for full travel cover.
Barclaycard offers more perks than most, including free purchase protection,
which insures many items bought with the card against theft or accidental
damage for 100 days after the purchase; free emergency assistance for
travellers, such as an emergency cash service; free travel accident
insurance (covering accidents which happen when you are in transit and not
mishaps at other times during the holiday); and a points system which can be
cashed in for gifts.
Affinity cards
These operate as credit cards but a small proportion of the money spent by
the holder is donated to charity. The card provider gives about Pounds 5 or
Pounds 10 to the charity the first time the card is used. Thereafter, a
fixed fraction of cash spent is donated - usually only about 20p or 30p per
Pounds 100.
You can be governed in choosing a card either by the charity or the
existence of a fee. For example, National Westminster has a World Wildlife
Fund for Nature affinity card but charges an annual fee of Pounds 12.
Alternatively, you can give free to Oxfam through Girobank, or to the Arts,
through Midland.
Charge, or Gold cards
Designed to appeal to high-earning big spenders. Charge cards such as
American Express and Diners Club give unlimited credit but have to be paid
off in full every month. Most Gold cards also operate as charge cards but
some, such as Lloyds Gold Mastercard, operate as a regular credit card. Such
cards have substantially higher annual fees - the Bank of Scotland announced
this week that it will raise its annual fee for its Premier Visa charge card
from Pounds 50 to Pounds 70 on June 1.
Those who benefit most from Gold and charge cards are travellers who need
hefty credit to cover expenses. However, be wary of using credit cards too
liberally abroad - most use an exchange rate more favourable to the issuer
than the customer. Similarly, check the exchange rate on some 'no
commission' promises, which are sometimes compensated by giving a worse
exchange rate than at other bureaux.
People who occasionally need a high overdraft will also find Gold and charge
cards attractive as they offer preferential rates on overdrafts, usually up
to Pounds 10,000. Barclaycard Gold charges 14.7 per cent EAR (equivalent
annual rate) on overdrafts of between Pounds 2,500 and Pounds 50,000,
compared with its 24.1 per cent EAR authorised overdraft rate. However, the
annual fee is Pounds 70.
Many Gold card holders might be better off switching to an ordinary card and
paying a smaller annual fee. It is easy to be seduced by the perks offered
by Gold and charge cards but customers should ask whether they really need
unlimited cover for emergency evacuation when travelling abroad - one of the
perks being added by Bank of Scotland as a sweetener for the rise in its
fee.
The Co-Op's Gold Visa card is one of the few no-fee cards but you must hurry
to get one - its promise never to impose a fee runs out on June 30.
Gold and charge cards are only available to those earning a minimum of
Pounds 20,000 a year - but you would have to earn much more in order to
settle bills of Pounds 1,000 a month regularly.
Another disadvantage is that Gold and charge cards are not covered
automatically by the Consumer Credit Act. However, Coutts, Co-Op, Girobank,
Lloyds (Mastercard) and NatWest (Visa) have all secured full CCA protection
on their Gold cards.

DIRECTORS' dealing activity has now calmed down to a more reasoned level
where the overall picture is no longer distorted by one-off influences.
Clinton Cards retails greeting cards and gifts throughout England. Directors
have been buying shares during April. Most recently Clinton Lewin, the
managing director, and Don Lewin, the chairman, both bought 25,000 shares at
76p. That is 16p higher than the price at which three directors bought two
weeks earlier.
Selling at Renishaw, the metrology and inspection equipment company, has
been a feature since the end of last year. Most recently Allan Roberts, the
finance director, sold 24,000 shares at 272p.
John Hall, the deputy chairman of Hall Engineering, and Robert McAlpine, a
non-executive director, both purchased shares in this steel processing
group.
Hall bought 14,000 shares at 152p in an off-market deal on April 29, while
McAlpine paid 148.5p for 15,000 shares from the market on April 23.
Results were announced at the beginning of April and the chairman said that
the board was confident about future prospects.

FT  09 MAY 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: A painful pension split
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NOW YOU see it, now you don't. That might be one way to describe the state
of many a wife's pension after her marriage has broken down.
The most valuable assets in many cases of divorce are the family home and
the husband's pension, but all too often the pension is forgotten, leading
to distress for many ex-wives in later years.
Pension rights are now recognised by the law as part of matrimonial property
but there are no detailed guidelines on the way in which they should be
allocated. 'In many cases (of divorce), the wife receives the greater share
in the residence, as a trade-off against the value of the husband's pension
rights,' comments the Working Group on Pensions and Divorce, in a
consultative document released this week.
With one in three marriages ending in divorce in the UK, there have been
calls for a change to the law, specifically for the splitting of pension
rights on divorce.
The Working Group was formed earlier this year by the Pensions Management
Institute and is receiving funding from the Joseph Rowntree Foundation. Its
consultative document has been issued so that responses from organisations
and people involved in the pensions field can be incorporated in a final
report, when the Group will recommend changes to the present system.
The courts do sometimes take a pension into account in a divorce settlement,
but this is usually when a couple is nearing retirement age. Younger women
are expected to have enough time to build up their own pension rights.
However, those with small children often take time off work or resort to
part-time work, so they cannot build up an adequate pension. Even married
women in full time work are likely to earn a smaller pension than their
husband.
The law on pensions and divorce is different in Scotland, where 'matrimonial
property' includes 'rights or interests of either party under a life policy
or occupational pension scheme.' It requires this to be shared fairly on
divorce; fair sharing means equal sharing unless there are special
circumstances which dictate otherwise. The Working Group asks whether the
rest of the UK should adopt a similar legal position.
One big problem with allocating a pension after a divorce is assessing its
value. There are two main methods. The first is to look at the 'cash
equivalent', which involves valuing the husband's pension as if he had left
the scheme at the time of the divorce.
The other way is to base the value of the pension on his pensionable service
to date and to allow for the possibility of future benefit payments and
increases in pensionable pay. This is sometimes known as the 'past service
reserve' and is likely to be larger than the cash equivalent because it
projects pay in the future.
However, determining which should be used as a basis for valuing the pension
if it is to be divided will not solve a further problem, which is that a
man's second wife will collect his pension benefits. Basing the value of the
pension on the whole of the husband's past pensionable service risks
reducing the benefits to the second wife and giving too much to an
oft-divorced wife.
The alternative to calculating the value of the pension at the date of
divorce (or separation) would be to follow Scottish law, where pension
rights that can be shared are limited to those arising during the length of
the marriage.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
NEXT week should provide some much-needed first-hand evidence about whether
the UK is finally pulling out of recession as some of the most influential
retailers report.
On Tuesday, Marks and Spencer, which has been riding the rough trading
better than most, is likely to edge profits 2 per cent higher to Pounds
635m. The company is expected to make an announcement about the future of
its loss-making Canadian operations. M and S's solid cost base and proven
management skills should have enabled it to combat a loss of market share.
But clothing margins will have been hit by widespread discounting elsewhere
and the food business will have felt the force of furious expansion
programmes of the big supermarket chains.
One of these, J. Sainsbury, is likely to boast of a more buoyant trading
picture the following day as annual profits are likely to surge by more than
20 per cent to the Pounds 610m mark.
However, Burton Group, the ill-starred fashion retailer which has seen two
chief executives depart in as many years, is only likely to confirm the
pattern of its recent grim trading fortunes when it reports on Wednesday.
Morgan Stanley suggests interim profits will be near Pounds 20m - with only
a token dividend.
Grand Metropolitan, the food, drinks and retailing group, is expected on
Thursday to lay the foundations for the further 'year of progress' promised
by Sir Allen Sheppard, the chairman. A 3 per cent rise in interim pre-tax
profits to about Pounds 390m is forecast with IDV, the drinks division,
leading the way.
British Gas is expected to report a drop in its first quarter net income on
Thursday to Pounds 630m from Pounds 729m in the same period last year. The
company saw profits eroded by warmer winter weather and lower gas production
at its Morecambe Bay field.
Royal Dutch-Shell, the Anglo-Dutch oil company, is estimated to have made a
profit of Pounds 685m in the first quarter on a replacement cost basis which
strips out stock losses and gains - half the level made in the same period
in 1991. The company is expected to be hit by a weakening in refining
margins, particularly in the Far East.
Two UK composite insurers report their first-quarter results next week, with
both are expected to show some improvement. Analysts expect Royal Insurance
to lose between Pounds 35m and Pounds 60m compared with a Pounds 63m deficit
in 1991. General Accident's losses are expected to be between Pounds 35m and
Pounds 50m (compared with a Pounds 75m loss).

FT  09 MAY 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: How to shoulder debt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
FOR MANY high-flyers the 1990s have recalled the tale of Icarus, who flew
too close to the sun and fell into the sea after the heat melted the wax on
his wings.
Rather than the sun's rays it is overborrowing and redundancy that is
bringing so many down with a bump today. Unable to pay their debts, they
receive some of the 208,000 county court judgments which are issued each
month.
Plunging high-flyers often make matters worse for themselves by desperately
flailing about. A private debt counselling firm I visited had just spoken to
a man who had rung up an extra Pounds 50,000 in unsecured debts in a
desperate attempt to find cash to pay his mortgage. Like many professionals
he had been ill-prepared for the trauma of being in debt.
The welfare state provides a safety net just above ground level - paying
mortgage interest and pocket money of around Pounds 40 a week. But this net
can quickly prove to be a trap. For every Pounds 1 a recipient earns, the
DSS removes Pounds 1 of support.
A person with a Pounds 100,000 mortgage therefore needs to earn Pounds
19,020 before his net income starts to increase. With a Pounds 200,000
mortgage the break-through earnings are Pounds 36,440. No-one who has paid
this 100 per cent tax rate at the DSS should ever complain about the Inland
Revenue's 40 per cent version.
Last month the DSS torpedoed hopes that the Department of Employment may
have of reducing the nation's dole queues. From April 6, anyone working over
16 hours a week is disqualified from receiving any income support. Such
part-time work is precisely the route that many redundant executives are
likely to take in re-entering the labour market.
This poverty trap makes it nearly impossible for the former high earner to
pay off his or her debts as extra earnings do not increase disposable
income. That leaves the unaccustomed debtor with the unedifying pauper's
progress of summonses, county court judgments and visits from bailiffs.
The depression that debt induces often delays consideration of the ways out
of this conundrum. One option is personal bankruptcy. Its stigma is rapidly
fading and more and more people have been unloading themselves of their
debts through this mechanism.
In the first two months of the year the number of people making themselves
bankrupt went up by 49 per cent to 1,500 a month. In two years time, if
their debts are under Pounds 20,000, (three years if their debts are larger)
these individuals will enjoy a completely fresh start with nearly all debts
written off. Exceptions include fines and debts arising from fraud.
Meanwhile, they can earn a basic income of perhaps Pounds 15,000 to Pounds
25,000 before the official receiver will want the top slice for creditors.
The official receiver (or insolvency practitioner operating in his stead) is
also considered to be far more generous than the average bailiff in terms of
the possessions a debtor may keep.
The pecuniary advantages of bankruptcy to the debtor are clear - a modest
lifestyle is possible for the two years with no fear of the bailiff calling.
But there is also a price to be paid in terms of dignity. After filling
forms in triplicate and shelling out Pounds 150 in court fees to petition
for bankruptcy, debtors have to go before a district judge and then an
official receiver to explain their finances. Remaining assets are not theirs
to dispose of during bankruptcy.
Fortunately for debtors, the surge in applications for bankruptcy means that
an individual is unlikely to be savagely interrogated by an official
receiver's staff. Cases are dealt with perfunctorily.
Other pitfalls of bankruptcy include the utility companies insisting that
the debtor pays for their supply by token meters installed in their home. An
official receiver will also tell neighbours of the debtor's
uncreditworthiness through an advertisement placed in the local paper.
Bankrupts are barred from being company directors without special
dispensation. They are also unable to practice as solicitors or accountants.
For people in these professions the advantage of renouncing debts as allowed
by bankruptcy is outweighed by the need to stay in work. For them a
'voluntary arrangement' is needed through which an insolvency practitioner
arranges a deal with creditors. Enough assets must be available to satisfy
not only creditors but also to pay the fee of the insolvency practitioner -
typically at least Pounds 1,000.
So long as three-quarters (by value) of creditors agree to the arrangement,
it is binding on all creditors. In the case of bankruptcy, creditors
typically might receive 20 per cent of assets. With voluntary arrangements
they tend to get around 40 per cent.
The payment terms are also important. A woman in Northumberland wrote to me
concerning a voluntary arrangement set up seven years ago by which she pays
off Pounds 25 a month. At that rate she still has 35 years of payments to go
and the stress is affecting her health. She now believes that she may have
made a mistake in not going bankrupt in the first place.
For those lacking the assets to pay for a voluntary arrangement, but who
cannot stomach bankruptcy, the alternative to the bailiffs is to negotiate
with creditors themselves. This can be done by letter, through a Citizens
Advice Bureau or by attending court to defend summonses when they arrive.
Unless particular creditors believe the debtor is stashing away a pot of
gold, they should be prepared to settle for less than the sum involved. The
prevalence of middle class debt means that the embarrassment attached to it
has eased. However, those who have suffered its indignities are likely to be
credit shy and avoid taking so many risks again.

FT  09 MAY 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Investor hits at bonus cut - Casebook
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT MAY just be good timing. But the announcement by Friends Provident on May
1 that it is cutting terminal bonus rates on its with profits policies might
provoke cynical comment.
The announcement was made just after comprehensive surveys were carried out
by Money Marketing and Money Management, authoritative industry sources
which financial advisers use to recommend the best policies for their
clients. Friends Provident came fourth in Money Marketing's table of top ten
endowment performers over ten years. If the cuts had been announced before
the survey, Friends Provident would have dropped down the tables, and
possibly out of the top ten.
Friends Provident had already cut its bonuses at the beginning of the year
and Benjamin Lemer, whose family owns several Friends Provident policies, is
angry about these new cuts. 'Companies take a view once a year. If they
change their mind every other week, how can you make rational investment
decisions?'
In April, Lemer received a letter from Friends Provident informing him of
the pay-out rate on one of his policies which is about to mature. But a few
days later he received another letter informing him that he would be getting
less.
'To cancel letters that have already gone out is really to shoot yourself in
the foot,' says Lemer, who has decided not to invest in the company's
products in future.
Assuming a 29-year-old non-smoking male paid monthly premiums of Pounds 35,
the pay-out from a ten-year endowment would have been Pounds 9,260 at
January 1 1992. But after the cut in the terminal bonus rate, the comparable
figure for maturity at May 1 was Pounds 8,701 - a difference of Pounds 559,
a 6 per cent drop.
Using the same assumptions Money Marketing, with figures for maturity values
at February 1, before the terminal bonus was cut, put Friends Provident's
figure at Pounds 9,176. The value for the last member of its top ten,
Commercial Union, was Pounds 8,746.
The effect of the cut on 25-year maturity values would also have pushed
Friends Provident down the table. If our investor had paid Pounds 20 a month
for a 25-year endowment, his pay-out at January 1 would have been Pounds
42,266, but after the cut a policy maturing on May 1 would be worth Pounds
41,623.
Graham Aslet, general manager at Friends Provident, who acknowledges that
announcements on rates are usually made at the beginning of the year, said
that the decision was taken after a valuation report prepared for the Board
in April. 'We said in December 1991 that we were entering a period of lower
returns and low inflation. This year saw the return of the Conservative
government and therefore a commitment to the Exchange Rate Mechanism.'
Lemer is unimpressed, particularly since the stock market reached an
all-time high last week. 'You could argue that when inflation and interest
rates are low, then the stock market might take off as people look for
investment alternatives. We were in the ERM in January, Labour was committed
to keeping us in it and Friends Provident made its cuts in January. What has
changed between January and now to justify further cuts?'

FT  09 MAY 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: National Savings cuts its rates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NATIONAL Savings overhauled its products this week in the wake of the base
rate cut and building society complaints that its products were luring their
depositors away.
Rates were cut by between 0.5 and 1 percentage point across the range. There
were also changes in the maximum holdings on certain products. The changes
were:
Certificates. The 36th issue (which paid 8.5 per cent) has been withdrawn;
the new 37th issue, on sale from May 13, will offer 8 per cent tax-free if
held for five years.
This is the equivalent, for a top rate taxpayer, to a gross rate of 13.33
per cent and still looks pretty attractive. Returns, of course, will be
lower if you cash in early. However, the maximum holding will be only Pounds
7,500, compared with Pounds 10,000 for the 36th issue.
The rate on the Yearly Plan has also been reduced from 8.5 per cent to 8 per
cent, but the maximum monthly contribution has been increased from Pounds
200 to Pounds 400.
Capital bonds. The Series C bonds, which paid a taxable 11.5 per cent, have
been withdrawn. The Series D certificates, on sale from May 13, will pay
10.75 per cent per annum if held for five years.
Taxpayers should be aware that, although interest is only paid on maturity,
they will be taxed each year as if they were receiving the interest in cash
terms.
The requirement to give three months notice before cashing in the bonds has
been abolished.
Children's bonus bonds. Issue A, which paid a healthy 11.84 per cent
tax-free, has been withdrawn. Issue B will go on sale from May 23 and will
pay 10.9 per cent per annum if held for five years. Returns on all these
certificates are fixed, and biased towards those who hold the bonds or
certificates for the full five years.
Income bonds. The return on these variable rate bonds will be cut from a
taxable 10.25 per cent to 9.25 per cent from June 18. The maximum holding
has been increased from Pounds 25,000 to Pounds 50,000. Joint holders may
now hold up to Pounds 100,000 between them.
Investment account. The variable return on this account will be cut from a
taxable 9.5 per cent to 8.5 per cent on May 19.
Deposit bonds. The variable return on these bonds, which are no longer on
sale, will be cut from a taxable 10.25 per cent to 9.25 per cent on June 18.
The building societies will make their own rate revisions, in the light of
the Chancellor's announcement, and investors may well find that these
National Savings returns are still highly competitive.

FT  09 MAY 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Taxing times at home . . . -
Expatriates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DONALD ELKIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DOES YOUR overseas home qualify as job-related accommodation? If so, and you
maintain a residence in the UK - particularly one on which there is a
mortgage - you could be in line for special treatment for capital gains and
income tax.
While you are neither resident nor ordinarily resident in the UK, you are
not subject to British tax on any capital gains you may realise - apart from
gains arising from assets used in a UK business. But a tax liability remains
for resources which you intend to retain beyond the date on which you resume
UK residence. This is particularly true for property.
Your principal residence will be exempt from CGT and, while the basic
requirement for full relief is continuous residence, there are special rules
for expatriates.
These provide that, if a property was your residence both before and after
an absence overseas, and in the intervening period you had no (other)
residence 'eligible for relief', your CGT exemption will be preserved even
though you let the house in your absence.
So, if you own a single property in the UK which satisfies the 'before and
after' test, and while you are abroad you live in rented accommodation, you
will face no problems.
But the situation is very different if you do not actually purchase the
property until you have been abroad for a while. Then you can satisfy the
'before' test only with difficulty, for although no period of residence is
specified in the legislation, you or your spouse would need to take up
residence for around three months to be sure of doing so. Even then, it is
doubtful whether you can nominate that property as your principal residence
instead of the one you rent overseas. A nomination can only be made in order
to choose between properties occupied contemporaneously.
But all of these problems dissolve if you live in job-related accommodation
overseas. You are then deemed to be living in the UK home as your residence.
While this treatment can be of considerable value, many expatriates may view
the question of whether or not they are entitled to MIRAS (mortgage interest
relief at source) for up to Pounds 30,000 of any loan used to acquire the
property, as one of more immediate concern.
You are not disbarred from MIRAS relief merely because you are non-resident
although it does then become difficult to fit yourself within the rules.
Nevertheless, you will obtain relief if the property is used wholly or to a
substantial extent as your principal residence - which means that you or
your spouse and family must live there for six months a year or more.
If, as in most cases, that is not feasible, you might nevertheless benefit
from the provisions of extra statutory concession A27. This extends the
relief to properties used as residences before departure overseas and which
are expected to be so used on return.
However, for all except Crown Servants, the absence overseas must not be
expected to exceed, and must not in fact exceed, four years.
The fact of living in job related accommodation overseas, plus the intention
to take up residence in the UK property can come to your aid. In these
circumstances, MIRAS relief will be permitted to continue without time
limit.
So what then is job related accommodation? For employees, it is
accommodation provided by reason of your employment: where it is necessary
for the proper performance of your duties; or where it is provided for the
better performance of your duties, and it is customary for employers to
provide accommodation for your job; or where there is a special threat to
your security.
But it would be a mistake to think that merely living in company property or
having accommodation provided as part of your salary package, means it will
be job related. The rules are strictly applied by the Revenue which will
look in detail at each case.
It is clear that if you pay rent for your accommodation, any claim that you
might have had will be destroyed because the property cannot be said to be
'provided' for you.
In practice, members of the armed forces, for example, should encounter no
problems if they live in the accommodation assigned to them. Civilian
workers who are accommodated in a company 'compound' should also succeed in
showing that they live in job-related accommodation. But if you do not fit
into these categories, be ready to prove your case.

FT  09 MAY 92 / Finance: More bait for home buyers - First-time home buyers
are getting better deals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BARCHARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE was good news for would-be home buyers this week as Halifax, Abbey
National, and Nationwide, the three largest UK mortgage lenders, trimmed
their rates in the wake of Monday's cut in bank interest rates.
Halifax cut its standard mortgage rate 0.3 percentage points to 10.65 per
cent. Most other building societies will probably move rates down in line
with Halifax to around 10.65 per cent or 10.7 per cent.
The good news was mainly for new customers. Existing customers of most
lenders will have to wait for another month or two for the new rates to
apply to them.
The banks and centralised lenders also face strong pressure to bring their
rates down in line with the societies. With interest rates low on the
commercial money markets, the centralised lenders ought to find it easier to
compete with the building societies, which fund their loans mainly out of
savings placed with them by their customers.
UCB Home Loans, for example, cut its variable interest rate for new
customers by 0.51 percentage points to 10.99 per cent. Existing customers
are promised a cut before too long. But this 'new rate', it is worth noting,
is only what most lenders were offering as long ago as January. Most other
centralised lenders are also still lagging the societies on their variable
lending rates and are trying to conceal this gap by filling their
shop-window with tempting fixed rate offers.
When the cuts feed through to existing borrowers, they are unlikely to make
a huge difference to their personal finances. The Halifax cuts are worth,
for example, between Pounds 8 and Pounds 10.50 a month on a Pounds 50,000
mortgage.
The cuts should encourage the market and help housing sales revive. If house
prices start to strengthen, existing mortgage customers will benefit,
especially those who have postponed a move until the housing market
recovers.
So the lenders are trying to find ways of tempting new borrowers into the
market. If you are about to take out a mortgage, you can look forward to a
discount which might take your mortgage interest rate, for the first year at
least, below 9 per cent.
Abbey National offers a discount of up to 1.75 per cent to first-time
buyers. It also charges less as the size of loans increase. Under its new
rates, mortgages of up to Pounds 60,000 will be cut from 10.9 per cent to
10.7 cent; Pounds 60,000 to Pounds 100,000 loans from 10.55 per cent to 10.2
per cent; and mortgages above that from 10.4 per cent to 9.99 cent.
However, many new borrowers will be more attracted by the thought of a fixed
rate mortgage. There are a number of these around offering rates of less
than 9 per cent.
A lot of these fixed rates are only for a year. Northern Rock has a fixed
rate of 8.95 per cent until August 1993. But to take advantage of it,
borrowers must have a loan to value ratio of less than 70 per cent and must
take out buildings and contents insurance from the society.
If you want a longer term arrangement, you will have to go above 9 per cent.
Chase de Vere, the mortgage brokers, is offering a mortgage fixed for one
year at 9.5 then capped at 10 per cent for the following two years. This is
available for repayment, endowment, pensions, and Pep mortgages. There is an
arrangement fee of Pounds 150 and three months additional interest payments
for early redemption of the loan.
First time buyers should bear in mind that the latest generation of fixed
rate mortgages was designed in the wake of the election and since then the
market has become more optimistic. The trickle of lenders offering rates
under 9 per cent to new buyers could become a torrent soon.

FT  09 MAY 92 / Finance: El Dorado: the search goes on - The risks and
rewards of emerging markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR HUNDREDS of years, explorers and investors have dreamed of faraway
cities, with streets paved of gold. And in the 1990s, there is a school of
thought which argues that real riches can be found, not in the stock markets
of developed countries such as the UK and the US, but in the shares of
emerging markets further afield. Profits have been discovered already. In
1991, Latin American Investment Trust was the best performing of all
investment trusts, and the list of top ten unit trusts over the five years
to end April includes both Abtrust's Far East Emerging Economies and the
Prosperity Emerging Markets funds.
The arguments for investing in emerging markets are simply put. These
countries have higher economic growth rates than the developed world, and
this should continue, thanks to rising life expectancy and improving
education.
The developing countries produced a 5.9 per cent GDP growth rate from
1965-80 and 4.3 per cent during 1980-89, according to the World Bank; the
equivalent figures for the industrial countries in those periods were 3.7
and 3 per cent respectively. The stock markets of emerging countries
represent a much smaller proportion of their gross domestic product than
their equivalents in the industrialised world. Many emerging countries are
introducing 'free market' reforms to encourage the growth of the private
sector, and are opening their stock markets to foreign investment. In short,
these economies are dynamic and should provide more opportunity for profit
than countries in the staid West. After all, Japan was an 'emerging market'
in the 1960s.
But there are dangers. The under-developed state of these stock markets
means that trading is illiquid, which may mean sharp swings in prices.
Shares can easily fall or rise by 10 per cent in a week.
There is no universally agreed definition of an emerging market. In recent
listing particulars from Templeton Emerging Markets Investment Trust, an
emerging market was defined as a nation with a low or middle income, or one
where stock market capitalisation is less than 2 per cent of the world
index. Over 75 per cent of the world's population live in such countries,
according to Templeton.
The vast majority of these emerging markets are found in three areas; Latin
America, south east Asia and the Mediterranean. African and eastern European
countries are seen as prospects for the future, but investment is still
limited.
The areas
In the minds of many investors, Latin America is probably still associated
with hyperinflation and military coups. But, according to William Calvert
who runs the Prosperity Emerging Markets trust, 'the whole financial
structure of Latin America has been redesigned.'
Market reforms have been introduced and democratic regimes are in place in
many nations. 'South America has been reverting to the promise of the 1950s
and 1960s,' says James Fairweather, who manages Martin Currie's emerging
markets fund. 'The region lost its way in the 1970s, and the economy went
nowhere in 1980s,' he adds.
The huge rises in Latin American share prices last year - the Argentinian
market was up 400 per cent in 1991 - might seem to suggest that private
investors have missed the boat. But Audley Twiston Davies, of Latin American
Securities, says the amount of foreign money which has moved into Latin
America has been relatively small. While many institutions will have a stake
in one Latin American company, very few will own shares in ten.
Davies says that some Latin American markets still look good on fundamental
grounds, citing Mexico where earnings growth is expected to be 25 per cent
and the prospective price-earnings ratio is only 12.
The dynamism of the South East Asian economies has been appreciated by
outside investors for some time. Many of the so-called 'tiger economies' are
candidates to repeat the Japanese performance. And recently, investors have
become excited by prospects for China, which seems to be opening up to
economic, if not democratic, reform.
Although there are a few quoted Chinese companies, the common route for
those wishing to invest in China has been via Hong Kong companies with
operations on the mainland. That has helped push Hong Kong shares to
all-time highs.
Scott McGlashan, who runs Perpetual's Asian smaller markets fund, has been
taking some profits from Hong Kong but is still optimistic about the
prospects for south east Asia, since he believes the region should benefit
from a US economic recovery.
How to invest
Investing directly in stocks in this area is out of reach of all but the
wealthiest. For most investors, a collective fund (unit or investment trust)
is the obvious route.
There are three sorts of fund, in roughly descending order of risk. The
first is an individual country fund; the second is regional; and the third
is an emerging markets trust, which invests across the world.
But just because an emerging market fund invests in a wide range of areas,
that does not mean it is immune from decline. The stock market crash of 1987
showed that markets round the world could be affected by the same event. A
breakdown in the Gatt talks on world trade might affect sentiment badly,
suggests Angus Tulloch, who manages the Stewart Ivory new Pacific trust
(although he is very positive for Asian shares on a five to ten year view).
However, a broad fund seems the logical first step in this field. Brian
O'Neill, who runs Gartmore Frontier Markets fund says: 'Areas which are
flavours of the month can come and go. Latin America is currently in fashion
but in 1989 it was Turkey and Greece. We think the retail client wants a
broad interest in emerging markets.'
Having chosen the geographical scale of the fund, the investor also has to
choose between a unit and investment trust; each has different attractions.
A unit trust offers the retail investor the ability to sell at net asset
value at any time. But that very liquidity can cause a problem for the fund
manager, who may be forced to sell stocks at rock bottom prices in declining
markets in order to meet redemptions. Thus unit trust performance can be hit
hard in declining markets.
The investment trust manager does not face that risk - he can afford to
leave his portfolio untouched through a bear market. But the risk is passed
on to the investor. If the county or region falls out of favour because of a
declining stock market, the investor may find that not only does the asset
value of the trust decline, but his shares fall to a discount. So the
investor suffers a 'double whammy'.
There are six emerging market investment trusts, although only two have
records lasting three years - and both have shown declines over that period.
However, Templeton Emerging Markets has a very good two-year record, with 76
per cent growth (mid-market to mid-market with income reinvested) and Latin
American Investment Trust was up 64 per cent over the last year.
Among the unit trusts, bid-offer spreads tend to be slightly higher in this
market (the average for the ex-Japan Far East funds is 6.3 per cent) so
investors' money will have to work harder to make a profit.

FT  09 MAY 92 / Markets: After the storms, the calm . . . - Wall Street
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIGHS OF relief rumbled round Wall Street all week.
First, there were no more riots, only the sad repairwork which followed one
of America's most uneasy weekends. Second, there were no surprises on the
economic front, just further confirmation that the nation is inching its way
out of recession.
The one disappointment was the absence of any additional reduction in
interest rates. By mid-week, hopes that the authorities would insure against
any slackening in the recovery by easing credit further had become
widespread. This could have had the effect of pushing down competing yields,
giving the stock market a compensating fillip.
But it was not to be - and on the economic evidence unveiled last week, such
action would barely have been justified, weakness in US money supply figures
notwithstanding. On Thursday, for example, the nation's retailers, reporting
April sales figures, showed fairly heartening advances. A day later, the
April jobs data also demonstrated a more healthy trend.
On the retail front, comparisons are muddied by the shift in Easter spending
from March in 1991 to April this year; to the lousy spring weather so far in
1992; and to the impact of the Gulf War on consumer confidence last year.
But those caveats aside, most of the big retail chains saw same-store sales
rise by anything from 5 to 13 per cent.
Only Sears, Roebuck, the troubled Chicago-based group whose management has
been the target of shareholder dissatisfaction, moved in the wrong
direction, posting a 2.1 per cent drop. It was scarcely the best augury
ahead of Sears' annual meeting next Thursday, and the group's shares eased
to Dollars 42 3/8 on Friday morning, down Dollars 1 on the week.
Friday's unemployment figures were equally upbeat. Non-farm payrolls grew by
126,000 last month, while most pundits had pitched their forecasts at about
half this number. March non-farm payrolls were revised upwards. And the
overall unemployment rate fell to 7.2 per cent in April, compared with 7.3
per cent in the previous month. Some analysts had suggested that it would
remain static.
Not surprisingly, the bond market weakened initially - although, by
lunchtime, the long bond yield was still shy of the 8 per cent mark. Most
pundits believe that the relatively strong employment report will stay the
Federal Reserve's hand in the immediate future, although views differ on
whether another easing is now ruled out in the future.
If interest rate reductions are postponed (or omitted), it seems unlikely
that Wall Street will show much progress.
The Dow Jones Industrial Index moved to a new high of 3,378.13 by Monday's
close - in part, a reaction to Friday's sell-off and relief that rioting in
Los Angeles had stopped. But, despite the subsequent interest rate
speculation, the stock market failed to follow through in any of the
following sessions. Instead, the Dow yo-yoed its way to the 3,365 mark by
Friday lunchtime. 'Even the rampant bulls have to be concerned about the
lack of follow-through,' commented one trader.
Signs that a plateau has been reached may be most apparent in the new issue
market. In the first few months of the year, this became a hubbub of
activity as companies rushed new equity to the market, tapping eager
investors for much-needed capital.
This week, however, Payless Cashways, a well-known building materials
retailer which was taken private via a management buyout in 1988, joined a
lengthening list of companies which have recently cancelled stock market
flotations. The company, which had planned to raise over Dollars 400m, cited
market conditions.
The Payless action follows that of GPM Gas, a unit of Phillips Petroleum,
and seems to confirm fears that the new issue market is turning sticky.
There is, moreover, the huge Dollars 2bn-plus General Motors issue to get
away later this month, while recent estimates have suggested that the total
backlog of shares still up for sale tops Dollars 13bn.
Somehow, supply and demand do not seem to be in the same happy proportions
which drove the market upwards earlier this year.

FT  09 MAY 92 / Markets (At a glance): Smaller companies rally
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Small company shares continued their recent rally this week. The Hoare
Govett Smaller Companies Index (capital gains version) rose by 2.2 per cent
to 1276.32 over the seven days to May 7, while the County Small Companies
Index also rose 2.2 per cent to 1006.1 over the same period. This week,
Perpetual is launching a smaller companies unit trust which has an initial
charge of 5.25 per cent and an annual fee of 1.25 per cent. Minimum initial
investment is Pounds 1,000 and there is also a savings scheme option of
Pounds 100 a month.

<TEXT>
Britannia Building Society is stopping its share dealing service with effect
from May 31. The society says it has seen a significant drop in turnover and
feels that there is a lack of consumer demand for the service, which was
introduced at the time of the privatisations. No new transactions will be
accepted from May 18 and the society is rebating customers the initial
administration fee they paid to open a sharedeal account.

The minimum limit for donations to charity which receive tax relief under
the government's gift aid scheme is to be reduced from Pounds 600 to Pounds
400, as planned in the Budget. In answer to a parliamentary question, Sir
John Cope, Paymaster General, said the forthcoming finance bill would change
the limit with effect from May 7. The rules governing tax relief on some
charitable covenants will also be relaxed - to allow charities to continue
receiving relief after the four year renewal date - from the same time.

FT  09 MAY 92 / Markets (At a glance): Yield curve flattens
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The cut in base rates this week further narrowed the gap between short and
long term interest rates (the yield on long-dated gilts). For a long time,
it was standard for short term rates to be below long term - in the jargon,
a positive yield curve - but in recent times a negative yield curve has been
the norm. Forcing short term rates any lower will probably require a similar
move in Germany.

FT  09 MAY 92 / Markets (At a glance): Housing market still gloomy
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Hopes for a quick recovery to the housing market still look far off as
lending for house purchases continues to reveal a steady decline. Quarterly
figures released this week were described by the Council of Mortgage Lenders
as 'very subdued.' They show that net new lending by banks, building
societies and other financial institutions for house purchases dropped in
the last quarter to Pounds 4.6bn compared with Pounds 5.4bn in the last
quarter of 1991. The Halifax house price index, also released this week,
fell by 0.4 per cent last month. The building society said that, 'even
adjusting for seasonality, the trend in house prices also remained weak.' UK
house prices are now 5.5 per cent below this time last year.

FT  09 MAY 92 / Markets: BAT runs smoke rings round history - The Bottom
Line
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN BAT Industries reported a 14 per cent rise in first-quarter pre-tax
profit on Wednesday, you had to pinch yourself to remember that it was only
two years since Sir James Goldsmith abandoned his attack on the
conglomerate.
The 'unbundling' of retailing and paper now seems like ancient history and
no one any longer raises an eyebrow at the incongruity of BAT's remaining
twin pillars of tobacco and financial services. The share price performance
 -beating the FT-A All-Share Index by 20 per cent since the beginning of
March and hitting a high of 807p last night - is evidence that the strategy
has paid off.
But with Eagle Star, the insurance subsidiary, making terrible losses in the
mortgage business, the improved perception of the group owes more to the
relentless rise in tobacco profits (see chart) than to the newer, fancier
financial services wing - which cigarette cash has helped to feather.
An interesting statistic that did not make it into this week's presentation
was that in the past five years, the world market for cigarettes open to
international producers has increased from 1.7 trillion (thousand billion)
to theoretically encompass the whole market of 5.4 trillion - including
China, which remains difficult to penetrate.
The growth has come from the ending of state monopolies in various EC
countries, the opening up of the Far East under US trade pressure and the
lifting of the curtain on eastern Europe.
Fuelled by such US and UK brands as Kent, Lucky Strike and State Express
555, export volumes rose by 18 per cent in the first quarter.
The potential for increasing penetration of new markets is illustrated by
Japan, where the proportion of imported cigarettes smoked has risen from 3
per cent to 17 per cent.
A few years ago, it would have been regarded as both tasteless and
financially unsound to talk in a bullish fashion about the prospects for
tobacco. The spreading of concern about the health risks was deemed to have
turned the market 'ex-growth'. Now, however, financial sentiment has
changed. The very bottom line is that BAT has been able to continue
increasing dividends in spite of the problems at Eagle Star, enabling it to
be compared favourably with the composite insurers.
Nevertheless, the fall in the trading profit of continuing businesses, from
Pounds 1.76bn in 1989 to Pounds 1.27bn last year, suggests that the
diversification into financial services has been far from smooth. When the
division's performance is broken down between the three main subsidiaries it
is easy to spot the culprit: Eagle Star made a trading profit of Pounds 294m
in 1989, but lost Pounds 392m last year. Meanwhile, Farmers Group, the US
insurer bought for Dollars 5.2bn (Pounds 2.93bn) in 1988, increased profit
from Pounds 327m to Pounds 359m and Allied Dunbar, the life business,
chugged ahead to Pounds 121m from Pounds 107m.
As Farmers was bought for cash, the financing cost has been substantial. In
the first quarter it knocked about 40 per cent off a record trading figure
of more than Pounds 100m.
Even the debacle at Eagle Star is now seen in a relatively sympathetic
light. Although it paid partly for its aggressiveness in the mortgage
indemnity market, the whole industry was caught out by repossessions and
falling house prices.
Eagle Star is now credited with moving towards lower-risk personal lines,
with making the necessary premium increases to start rebuilding margins and
with tackling the issue of distribution, which in the UK is typically done
indirectly, through brokers.
Recovery potential in financial services gives BAT two strong cards in the
market rating game: steady growth from tobacco and bounce-back in the
recession-hit part. Hence the high share price.
Has it gone far enough? At last night's close of 807p, the prospective
price-earnings ratio was 15 to 16 on a pre-tax profit forecast of about
Pounds 1.5bn.
The premium of roughly 10 per cent to the market looks deserved, bearing in
mind the above-average yield and prospective dividend growth ahead of
inflation. While scope for progress from a high point is limited, smokers
would have done well to put their money where their mouth is.

FT  09 MAY 92 / Markets: Doublespeak in the finance game - Serious Money
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Personal Finance Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MY OLD friend Professor Walt Anschaung was very excited when I saw him this
week, as he prepared for his annual lecture on doublespeak to the Winston
Smith society.
'Zere are some very innovative uses of language at the moment,' he
exclaimed. 'I think I may have a chance of the Nobel prize in surreal
semantics. Take ze reduction in UK base rates this week by chancellor Norman
Lamont. I saw one tabloid paper announce that millions of homeowners were
given a welcome cut in mortgage rates as a consequence.'
'What was wrong about that?' I asked, innocently.
'It was a bit premature. Most lenders that announced a cut made one for new
borrowers only. And in the current state of the housing market, there are
hardly any new borrowers. All that good publicity will cost the societies,
as you say in England, only tiny spuds.'
'So what will happen to existing borrowers?'
'They will have to wait. A change will be announced in due course, as they
say, which probably means a month or two before their bills fall. Meanwhile,
savers are going to see their rates reduced almost immediately. Although, of
course, it will not be described as a cut.'
'Take two advertisements from the Halifax this week,' said the Professor,
pulling some clippings from his white coat. 'How low can you get, asks the
first, following it up with the words (in bold type and capitals) 'new
reduced mortgage rates.' But the second says merely Notice to Halifax
customers, with underneath the words (in restrained type) 'Halifax Building
Society announces the following changes to interest rates.' No mention of a
cut, or a reduction at all.'
'At least the Halifax is advertising its changes,' I pointed out. 'Remember
all those societies which replaced their old accounts without letting their
customers know? That's another good piece of doublespeak - societies are run
for the benefit of their members.'
'Indeed,' the Professor pointed a finger at me accusingly. 'You never told
me what an exciting field you worked in. The financial services industry
could hold a gargantuan gala of gobbledegook every year. Take bonus rates on
endowment policies, for example. There has been a round of bonus cuts on
those policies. But do the companies call them cuts? No. They are described
as adjustments.
'Even National Savings is not immune,' he continued. 'The recent ads for its
capital bonds had the rate - then 11.5 per cent - in big letters. Investors
were told that they had to pay tax on the interest every year, but what was
not clear was the fact that no income is paid out. You only receive the
return when you cash in the bonds. So an elderly investor who wanted income
every year might have been disappointed.
'And then there was an advertisement from the Homeowners Friendly Society.
It offered a bond where you could take up to 15 per cent income a year.
Sounded a great deal. But, of course, unless the bond performs extremely
well, then taking as high an income as that would cause a decline in your
capital.'
'Didn't the ad refer to that risk?' I asked.
'Well, it did say that taking an income which is greater than the growth
rate would reduce your capital over time. In fact, it would reduce your
capital straight away. The unsuspecting investor might get a very nasty
shock.'
'So what can the poor consumer do, Professor?' I asked.
'My new book, 1984 ways to confuse the financial services consumer
(available from room 101 of all good bookshops) will, as zey say, suck the
lid off the whole caboodle. It will cost Pounds 5.01, of course. I hate
things that are priced at Pounds 4.99.'
'Enough of the plug' I said. 'Give me three points for the consumer to
remember.'
'OK. First, remember that you have to look after number one. Do not assume
that a financial institution is as protective as your big brother. You have
to monitor your savings and your products to make sure you are being fairly
treated. Ignorance isn't strength.
'Second, read the small print. The financial services regulatory structure
is far from perfect but it normally does ensure that the vital information
appears somewhere in the documentation. And if you don't understand the
jargon, ask. Don't buy the product until you are sure. There is rarely any
need to rush.
'Third, use a good financial adviser, preferably one who charges a fee. They
can be great at sorting out the pros and cons of an investment, like the
Pensionsline service you have written about this week on page V'
'More specifically, Professor,' I said, 'what can savers do in the future?
Interest rates are falling and some expect base rates to reach 8 per cent by
the end of next year.'
'Well, if you don't need income, then the National Savings fixed rate
products, even at reduced levels, still look attractive. If you do need
income, then gilts currently yield over 9 per cent to redemption, although
you need to realise if you buy one above par value that, in return for a
higher running income, you face a capital loss.'
'One last question, Professor,' I asked. 'How do I finish this article?'
'Easy,' said the sage. 'Orwell's that ends well.'

FT  09 MAY 92 / Markets: The only way is up - or maybe down - London Markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GLOOM abounded this week. The largest all-British oil company announced its
first loss. A huge property group teetered on the brink of collapse.
Retailers warned that there were few signs of life in the high street.
Dividends were cut or paid uncovered. And the stock market . . . umm . . .
start again.
Glorious sunshine on the May Day bank holiday set the tone for the week in
the stock market. New records were set as the FT-SE 100 index steamed
through 2700 and closed yesterday at 2725.7, up 65.9 on the week.
Base rates were cut on Tuesday morning, as were mortgage rates. Sterling
blazed against the German mark. Reviving consumer confidence lifted new car
sales in April for the first time in 30 months. Local government election
results confirmed the Tory victory in the general election.
Listen to a few stockbrokers and it is soon clear that the next significant
move in the market will be up - or, possibly, down. That's what makes a
market, they say. The bulls are still charging towards 3000; the bears are
selling at best.
A record high provides a good moment to look at the two sides of the
argument. As the chart shows, the last cut in base rates, in September,
coincided with the market reaching an all-time high. It then retreated for
the rest of the year. Will share prices follow the same pattern this time?
The bull case is that the British economy is starting to pick up, and this
time that is definite. Although the revival will be slow, the UK stock
market should do what Wall Street has done - anticipate the recovery.
At the same time, foreign investors are now persuaded that Britain is a
politically stable place to put their money with the added prospect of a
rising stock market. Cuts in interest rates attract, rather than deter,
funds. Sterling rises as cash flows in; that allows further rate cuts,
stimulating the economy, and so on round the virtuous circle.
Britain has looked more attractive to international investors as the
situation in Germany has worsened. As the former model of financial
rectitude was yielding to union demands, the large international securities
firms advised clients to shift their European portfolios to the UK.
Now for the other side. The bears agree that there are some signs of
economic recovery. But, they say, the stock market has more than discounted
this already, and the same event cannot be discounted twice.
At the all-time high last September the market was on an historic p/e of 14
1/2 . Now it is on a multiple of 16 1/2 times, the difference caused by the
sharp drop in earnings reported between the two dates. The market is already
at a high valuation, and it will take concrete earnings growth before the
p/e falls enough to make it worth buying again.
The bears explain this week's rise by summoning up the twin spirits of
foreign buyers and squeezed market makers. As far as the bears are
concerned, foreign buyers rate just above taxi drivers in their
understanding of the stock market, and a squeeze on the market makers is
dismissed as 'technical factors'.
The phlegmatic bears just see the week's rise as an even better selling
opportunity. They were feeling rather exposed for most of the week, but
yesterday afternoon's sale by Hanson of its 2.8 per cent stake in ICI gave a
boost to the bear case.
On Tuesday the base rate cut brought an early jump in the market, but the
high for the day was at 8.38am. By the close the FT-SE 100 was only 2.4
points higher. That suggests that UK investors were unexcited about the rate
cut once it had happened - or possibly that they had taken Tuesday off work
as well as Monday.
The buying started in earnest on Wednesday as the foreign investors - the
theory goes - read about the interest rate cut in their newspapers. They
found the market makers short of stock and pushed the index up 36.5 points
to a close just short of 2700. Thursday was another dull day, with a 3.2
point gain just tipping the index over the 2700 level, and then yesterday
saw another surge after the local election results.
Certainly there has been little to inspire confidence in the week's company
news. On the positive side, the prospect of a real bid from Lloyds Bank for
its rival Midland is still being dangled tantalisingly. That is even after
the apparent setback to Lloyds of the probable different treatment by
competition authorities of its bid, and that from Hongkong and Shanghai
Bank.
But elsewhere there are further reports from the recession front line.
British Petroleum made a first quarter loss but maintained its dividend.
Trafalgar House, the property, construction and engineering group - which
owns the Ritz Hotel and the QE2 as well - halved its interim dividend in
spite of an 18 per cent rise in pre-tax profits to Pounds 54m. The new
dividend rate is more likely to be sustainable.
Tate &amp; Lyle, the sweetener group, suffered a dip in interim profits, from
Pounds 94.7m to Pounds 92m, after some years of strong earnings growth.
Retailing is still not a happy industry with Sears, the shoe shops to
Selfridges group, reporting a 45 per cent fall in annual pre-tax profits to
Pounds 81.2m - and that is before the housebuilding business was pushed
below-the-line. British Gas discovered what it is like to operate in the new
low-inflation environment, when it was told by its regulator to cut prices.
Analysts estimated a 2p a therm cut would knock Pounds 250m from annual
profits of over Pounds 1bn.
Meanwhile, in the casualty ward, Olympia &amp; York, with property assets which
could be called liabilities, and WPP, whose assets go home every night, both
think their banks would like to swap some of their loans into shares. Is
that top of the market talk?

FT  09 MAY 92 / Long View: Update on the bull market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARRY RILEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UP GO those share prices. London has been following Wall Street into new
high ground this week, with the Footsie Index breaking through 2700, and
even poor old Tokyo has been staging something of a rally.
There is nothing like a fall in interest rates to stimulate the stock
market. Mathematically, it is worth paying more for a stream of future
dividends if the alternative rewards for investment are coming down. Of
course, you can argue that short-term interest rates, which fell in the UK
this week, are less relevant than long-term bond yields, or perhaps the real
return on index-linked gilts. However, it is spring, and there is economic
recovery in the air, if not yet in the statistics.
The stock market is the most sensitive indicator we have. Other asset
markets are not yet giving the same signals: the dreary old residential
housing market, for instance, was still heading downwards in April according
to the Halifax Building Society. The average house last month was worth 5.5
per cent less than a year earlier.
You would not expect the house market and the stock market to move precisely
in line. The market in homes is very inefficient because people tend to hold
their property off the market rather than accept what they consider to be
unrealistic prices.
There are no market makers to cut prices to whatever level will stimulate
demand. Funnily enough, though, share prices at the beginning of April,
ahead of the election, were running 5 or 6 per cent below their year-earlier
level, extraordinarily similar to the pattern in house prices.
It was the election result that transformed the stock market, leading to a
jump of 12 1/2 per cent since two days before the poll. Estate agents will
no doubt be anticipating a similar effect in the property market, but there
is a big overhang of unsold homes to be cleared.
However, just as Wall Street is supposed to have signalled five of the last
three recessions, for the London equity market this is the second
celebration of the coming recovery. Share prices were buoyant late last
summer as interest rates fell and the politicians tried to talk the economy
up.
As base rates dipped to 10 1/2 per cent at the beginning of September the
FT-SE 100 Index hit an all-time high of 2679.6 which has not been exceeded
until this week, as the next half-point has finally come off short-term
interest rates after eight months. In the meantime the economic upturn
scheduled for the third quarter of 1991 has been postponed: it may be
happening in the second quarter of 1992.
And although the overhang of supply is not so immediate as it is in housing,
where estate agents' windows are full of highly desirable but highly
unshiftable properties, or even in the gilt-edged market, where the Bank of
England has eagerly sold at least Pounds 4bn of new bonds into the
post-election upsurge, the flow of share issues will soon begin.
It takes a few weeks and months before the merchant bankers can groom their
corporate clients to exploit better market conditions, but we know that
several big flotations and secondary offerings are in the pipeline: they
include GPA, 3i and the Daily Telegraph, while another Pounds 4bn worth of
Wellcome is in the offing. Rights issues are rather more problematical to
predict: after last year's huge flow of more than Pounds 10bn the pace has
slackened. But it might accelerate again if the economy improves and
companies become confident they will not risk debacles such as the British
Aerospace issue last year.
I would be surprised if the UK stock market were to advance very much
further from here, but it cannot be ruled out: markets often overshoot. And
I see from a circular by Kleinwort Benson's chartist Nick Glydon that the
seasonal pattern in equities appears to have changed in the past five years
so that July or August rather than May are the best months to take profits.
We need a new rhyming wisdom: sell in Jul or look a fool, perhaps?
With the dividend yield now down to little more than 4 1/2 per cent the
market can no longer be said to look superficially cheap, given that the
prospects for dividend growth over the next year or two are dreary. The
yield gap over index-linked gilts has shrunk to about 0.1 per cent, compared
with a typical 0.5 per cent or so over the past few years; this gap has
never gone negative except in the few months before the 1987 crash, and if
this reversal happens again we should take it as a warning.
The longer-term perspective is that the London stock market is now 19 months
into a bull market that began in the autumn of 1990 (the precise timing
being related to the Gulf crisis, however, rather than domestic factors).
Since the turn, share prices have climbed by 35 per cent, the bulk of which
was achieved within the first year. We are only just emerging into new
all-time high ground, and in fact the advance by the broadly-based All-Share
Index is no more than 5 per cent since the old July 1987 peak. Admittedly
there has actually been a fall in real terms of a substantial 23 per cent
since then, but at that stage the market was seriously overvalued (a few
weeks after a Tory election victory, incidentally, albeit a confidently
expected one).
Another significant upward leg of the bull market will need to be supported
by company profits. Earnings per share have fallen by about 8 per cent on
industrials over the past year and the historic price-earnings ratio is a
demanding 16.5. It would be reasonable to expect earnings per share to rise
by 15 per cent this year if the economic recovery comes through on any
scale, but even so the p/e would remain quite demanding. Later on the
recovery seems bound to bring problems with the balance of payments and the
financing of the government's deficit so 1993 could prove hard going for
equities.
But I don't want to spoil a good story by adding an unhappy ending.

FT  09 MAY 92 / Keep out, this is western Europe: As refugees flock to
richer countries from more troubled areas, David Marsh observes the backlash
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ALONG THE Austrian-Hungarian border, winding through the fertile Burgenland
region south of Vienna, the gaunt steel watchtowers on the eastern side are
deserted, relics of the Cold War. On Austrian soil, new look-out platforms
have sprung up, manned by army conscripts in sheepskin coats. They are
watching not for the march of communism, but for travellers from Turkey,
Romania, Sri Lanka or Bangladesh seeking illegal entry. The Iron Curtain has
been dismantled. But as the west attracts a growing stream of fugitives from
troubled parts of the world, immigration has become the focus of Europe's
fears.
In the gentle hills of the Burgenland, an immigrant's first encounter is
often with a man in uniform. 'They can cause disquiet among the population,'
says Gerhard Wild, a burly official at police headquarters in Eisenstadt,
the main town in the region. Some steal local bicycles, he says. 'Most are
economic refugees,' adds Karl Barilich, a young Austrian gendarme on patrol
in his van. Captured border-crossers are taken to an impromptu reception
centre in bleak rooms at a disused sugar refinery. They are questioned,
photographed and given medical checks. After a few hours, those without a
prima facie case for political asylum are sent back to Hungary. 'Normally,
they are exhausted - they just want to sleep,' says Barilich. Before going,
they can take their pick from second-hand clothes donated by local
residents.
The fugitives are disaffected survivors of the revolutions and disruption
which have swept through eastern Europe and the Third World. Instead of
succour, they meet bile. Immigrants put pressure on jobs, housing and social
security. The prosperous half of the continent is experiencing economic
slowdown and a sharp swing to xenophobic far right-wing parties - seen in
elections in France, Germany and Italy during the past few weeks. In the
ugliest of ironies, the newcomers find themselves blamed for political
turmoil in places they regarded as the promised land.
From all sides they come; and, on all sides, they are unwanted. Spain's
Guardia Civil stands ready to repel immigrants from north Africa. The French
gendarmerie are on patrol in Marseilles, while German border guards scan the
wetlands of the River Oder for illicit arrivals from Poland. Most fugitives
seek political asylum - even though their chances of acceptance are small.
In western Europe 540,000 asylum-seekers were registered in 1991 - nearly
twice the 1989 figure and more than three times 1987's. Germany alone
attracted a record 256,000 asylum-seekers last year. Total immigration into
western Europe topped 1m (including 220,000 ethnic Germans from eastern
Europe and the former Soviet Union who went to Germany and get automatic
citizenship rights there). The flows have crossed to Britain too. The Home
Office recorded 44,000 asylum applications in 1991. A lorryload of illegal
Indian immigrants hit the headlines in March after being apprehended by
police on a motorway.
Austria is the traditional gateway between east and west. But on the border,
hopes of a new life can turn sour quickly. Last year, the Austrian police
and army caught 12,000 illegal immigrants from Asia, Africa and eastern
Europe. Many are taken to Hungary by unscrupulous international couriers and
unloaded from buses and vans within walking distance of Austrian territory.
Then, they are on their own.
In Austria, as across the whole of Europe, the strains are coming to the
surface. Last year, 27,000 people applied for asylum - more per capita than
in Germany, An additional 13,000 fugitives from the civil war in Yugoslavia
 -most from Croatia - were given temporary refuge in Austrian homes, hostels
and church buildings. Anti-foreigner sentiment helped Austria's
nationalistic Freedom Party to a sharp surge in council elections last
November. Jorg Haider, the party's demagogic leader, used the slogan 'Vienna
for the Viennese,' in his November campaign.
General elections in Switzerland and Belgium last year produced a marked
far-right shift. Jean-Marie Le Pen's Front National (FN) in France attained
13.9 per cent of the vote in regional elections in France in March. And in
Germany on April 5, the ultra-right German People's Union and Republicans
parties swept into state parliaments in Schleswig-Holstein in the north and
Baden-Wurttemberg in the south. Christian Kas, the Republicans' leader in
Baden-Wurttemberg, accuses the country's established politicians of
showering largesse on asylum-seekers while plunging east Germans into
poverty.
Ballot-box support for such parties parallels an increase in
racially-motivated violence. Even peaceful Sweden has seen an increase in
apparently motiveless attacks on foreigners.
In Germany, where racial attacks have become almost routine since the
autumn, the number of immigrants camping out in Munich has prompted fears
that the city's traditional autumn beer festival could be cancelled. An
Interior Ministry official in Bonn says: 'The asylum problem, linked to
worries about law and order, is the number one question. It's only a matter
of time before this blows up.'
Tension is certainly in the air at a sprawling camp for displaced foreigners
in the town of Traiskirchen, near Vienna. Since 1956, the former Austrian
military academy has been a transit centre. Around 300 asylum-seekers live
there. They stay for a few days to complete formalities before being
allotted more permanent quarters in guesthouses and hostels around the
country.
Under recently-toughened laws, asylum-seekers who arrive in Austria from
'safe' countries can be expelled summarily. Some immigrants throw away their
identification papers to hinder the authorities. Faced with such awkward
charges, the camp staff are not overly sympathetic. 'The niggers are this
way,' said a young administrator, bustling through the building towards a
group of Sudanese men cutting each other's hair in the corridor. In an
attempt at heavy irony, directed at the administrator, one man grins: 'The
Austrians are not racists. Oh no, they are not Nazis.'
The atmosphere 600 miles away, in the south of France, is only a little less
chilly. Frejus, an undistinguished, sun-specked town of 40,000 between Nice
and Toulon on the Riviera, is home to 4,000 foreigners, most from North
Africa. Some are new arrivals but most have lived there for years, normally
in relative harmony with the locals.
In January, however, police swooped on a shanty town near the railway
station housing immigrant workers. They arrested 12 people on arms or drugs
charges and 18 for holding invalid identity documents. Municipal employees
then pulled down some of the shacks. The Front National claimed the
ramshackle village was not only a centre for drugs dealing but also an
illegal source of cheap labour for construction companies, undercutting
normal pay rates.
On the outskirts of the town is the Agachon housing estate which the local
FN labels a 'ghetto.' It is, a fairly basic, low-rise housing complex,
renovated and whitewashed in the best Mediterranean style. Many
second-generation immigrants living here have parents who came to France
from the Magreb during the 1960s' boom. Marcel, a young mixed-race resident,
tells me that one of his parents came from Africa but he has French
nationality. He praises behaviour on the housing estate compared with others
in the town.
Fifty miles westwards, in the port of Toulon, Jean-Marie Le Chevallier, a
bespectacled European parliament deputy for the FN, who propelled the party
to 29 per cent of the vote in the town in the March elections, tells a
different story. Over lunch in his dusty house, he holds forth on the
Front's repatriation policies. What, I inquire, would he do with Marcel?
'Ask him: 'Does he love France?'' replies Le Chevallier, between mouthfuls
of lamb and red wine. The implication is that, if Marcel does not, he would
be deported. Le Chevallier adds: 'It is less costly to spend billions to
return them to Algeria and Tunisia than to have a civil war.'
He claims that immigrants in France were, simultaneously, taking jobs away
from the French and sponging on social security. 'You earn more for doing
nothing here than by working in a developing country.'
As the chief destination of European immigration, Germany is at the eye of
the storm. The town of Unna-Massen, an hour's drive from Dusseldorf in the
prosperous state of North Rhine-Westphalia, is host to one of the country's
best known refugee transit centres. Opened in 1951 for German refugees
expelled from Poland, last year it was temporary home to 60,000 ethnic
Germans from the former Soviet Union and eastern Europe.
Jurgen Kraska, the camp's deputy head, thinks numbers will increase this
year because of 'uncertainties' in the Soviet republics. He said that more
Soviet Jews - given special status in Germany - are turning up at the camp,
reporting anti-Semitic attacks around Moscow and St Petersburg.
Among the roughly 2,500 inmates is Erika Ems, a wizened lady from
Kazakhstan. She is glad to be here. 'It is like the difference between day
and night,' she croaks. Peter Potempa, an engineer who says he left Poland
because 'nothing has changed' after the end of communism, is looking forward
to getting a job in Germany. Potempa, however, speaks only Polish - and, in
western Germany, jobs are growing scarcer.
To cope with growing public irritation about unkempt refugees clogging
Dusseldorf, the North Rhine-Westphalian government is trying revolutionary
methods to try to stem the exodus from south-east Europe. It has allocated
around DM20m (Pounds 6.80m) for a programme of house-building and job
creation in the Macedonian town of Skopje, and repatriated itinerant
Macedonians who were camped in tents on Dusseldorf's Rhine banks. Albert
Harms, the enterprising government official who negotiated the arrangement,
says the deal could save money by pruning state government spending on
social security for asylum-seekers.
Schemes like this offer a constructive way of easing migration pressures. In
general, however, governments throughout Europe are tired of putting up
funds, and are talking of putting up barriers instead. As the havens grow
less secure and more unwelcoming, the tide of those seeking to come ashore
shows no sign of ebbing.

FT  09 MAY 92 / The Lex Column: Midland
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
However it dresses it up, the Hongkong Bank has difficulty making its bid
for Midland look as attractive as the putative offer from Lloyds. An HSBC
victory would produce a better capitalised bank than Lloyds combined with
Midland. Restructuring costs would also be less than half. But the change of
tax residence would require a special Pounds 200m tax provision and the
eventual profits benefit would be only Pounds 300m a year compared with
Pounds 700m in cost savings alone under the Lloyds plan.
HSBC is at pains to argue that these figures are not necessarily comparable.
Its assumptions on cost savings, in areas like information technology, do
not include any benefit from Midland's continuing restructuring. That
suggests several hundred branch closures and heavy job losses in the UK even
if HSBC wins. The combined banks would generate about Pounds 150m in extra
revenues. But however conservative, such forecasts cannot carry any absolute
guarantee. Though Lloyds may lose some revenues from branch rationalisation,
it stands to make a lot more by selling insurance through the Midland
network.
It would be extraordinary if HSBC made as much commercial sense as Lloyds as
a partner for Midland. But since the competition authorities may render the
comparison theoretical, the real question is whether HSBC makes a sensible
case on its own. Its shareholders seem sceptical. HSBC fell over 3 per cent
in an otherwise little changed Hong Kong market yesterday. The risks
inherent in such a widely-spread conglomerate are high, while the forecast
benefits from 1996 amount to only 14 per cent of last year's combined
profits before provisions.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
For the UK market, Hanson's sale of its ICI stake is open to two opposite
interpretations. The bulls will assume the Hanson mega-bid is finally
arriving on Monday morning. The bears will infer that Lord Hanson, having
made a 17 per cent capital gain in a year when the FT-SE rose 11 per cent,
is now calling the turn in the market.
The bull case owes more to the market's fevered state of mind than to logic.
In the context of the imagined mega-bid, the Pounds 280m proceeds from the
ICI stake are loose change. More to the point, the whole ICI episode has
proved, if not a fiasco, then at least an embarrassment for which Pounds 40m
gross capital gain is meagre compensation. It would be an odd time, surely,
for Hanson to plunge into another venture on such a scale.
As for calling the turn on equities, the truth could be less dramatic. In
selling Ever Ready and the ICI stake and issuing a Pounds 500m Eurobond,
Hanson may simply have calculated that with the world's bankers staring at
black holes like Olympia &amp; York, this is a good time to reduce bank debt.

<TEXT>
Germany's public sector pay round has been such a humiliation for the
government that it is easy to overdo its implications for the markets. The
actual settlement will prove more expensive for the employers than the
arbitration deal they originally rejected, so they could have saved
themselves the trouble of a strike. Yet the final percentage is still within
the range of expectations pencilled in by most economists. It should not of
itself upset the Bundesbank.
A more pressing problem remains the explosion in German money supply. If
April's figure, due in a couple of weeks, does show an annual growth of over
10 per cent, as many economists fear, the central bank may come under strong
pressure to raise rates again. Though interest rates are a blunt weapon,
there are not many alternatives: rationing Lombard facility advances to the
banking system would raise money market rates anyway.
The bond market looks likely to suffer whatever happens. Premature easing by
the Bundesbank would add to market worries about a government which, in the
aftermath of the strike, appears to have lost its grip. If interest rates
are maintained or increased, the steep inversion of the yield curve will
continue to push investor funds towards short-term deposits. The fact that
this is not the case in the UK and France is one more reason to expect
spreads between government bonds in these countries and Germany to narrow
further. But despite sterling's astonishing performance against the D-Mark
since Tuesday's UK rate cut, it would not do to anticipate gilt yields
actually falling below those on German bunds.

<TEXT>
The UK equity market has reached the point where any remaining bears must
find their nerve severely tested. The case for a further rise is still
debatable, but looks increasingly plausible. The argument is that the market
is going through one of its periodic large-scale adjustments. Having swept
through its previous record, it could now establish 2700 on the FT-SE as a
floor rather than a ceiling.
This would not be without precedent. In the last big adjustment, at the
start of the Gulf war, a new floor was established at the previous ceiling
of 2400. Again, the FT-SE has risen 14 per cent in the past month. In the
first month of the Gulf rally it rose by 12 per cent. In the following month
it rose another 9 per cent, before levelling out briefly at 2500. As luck
would have it, a further 9 per cent would bring the FT-SE within 30 points
of the similarly tempting target of 3000.
The parallels should not be pushed. In particular, the approach of the Gulf
war knocked the market much harder than the approach of the election, so the
bounce was correspondingly dramatic. But again, the defeat of Saddam Hussein
left the market in many ways back where it started. This time it has the
certainty of five more years of right-of-centre government, new-found
popularity with the international investing community and the final evidence
of an economic upturn.
The scale of the upturn may still be doubtful. But judging by yesterday's
crop of annual meetings, UK company chairmen are coming round. The start to
1992, Burmah Castrol said, had been 'very solid'. IMI saw increasing signs
of the recession ending. Rugby reported profits ahead of budget. Around 20
FT-SE companies are due to produce results within the next stock exchange
account. If they keep that up, the bears will have more to worry about
again.

FT  09 MAY 92 / World Stock Markets: When small can be not quite so
beautiful - Patrick Harverson charts current disillusion in the US with
hard-hit biotech and healthcare stocks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHAT IS wrong with small stocks? While the Dow Jones industrials and the
broad market S&amp;P indices have hovered around record highs, indicators of
smaller stocks have displayed a marked under-performance in recent months.
Since posting a record high of 644.92 on February 12, the Nasdaq composite
index of over-the-counter stocks, which includes a lot of small-sized
companies, has fallen just over 9 per cent, closing at 587.16 on Thursday.
Over the same period the even broader Russell 2000 index of
small-capitalised stocks has dropped about 7 per cent from the mid-February
high of 212, while the Value Line Index of small caps has given up almost as
much of its gains.
Analysts have been saying the same thing in recent weeks: small stocks are
taking a beating because they were driven too high last year by speculative
buying that lost touch with their underlying earnings potential.
The damage inflicted on some of the high-flyers of six months to a year ago
has been remarkable. Biotechnology and healthcare stocks have been hit the
hardest, primarily because they enjoyed so much of the attention in the
record-breaking rally of 1991.
Immunex is a typical example. In January the maker of immunological
biological products was trading around Dollars 60; by the end of April it
had fallen to Dollars 26.
Over the same period Cytogen, which produces biochemical systems for
treating cancer, dropped from Dollars 34 to Dollars 17, while the value of
shares in another anti-cancer drug maker, Immunogen, was more than halved to
Dollars 12.
Probably the biggest blow to the biotech sector was administered last month
when the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) declined to grant approval for
Centoxin, a drug for treating septic shock produced by Centocor, whose stock
plunged from its high this year of Dollars 60 to Dollars 12 on news of the
decision.
Analysts had talked of potential sales of about Dollars 1bn for Centoxin,
and the FDA's refusal to approve it was a big blow not just to Centocor, but
to the entire sector, as expectations that other drugs would be approved
were dashed by talk that the FDA was taking a tougher line.
Centocor's problems highlight the risks investors face when buying stock in
biotech companies whose future may rest on one product, or an awaited
scientific breakthrough.
The fast-growth biotech stocks were particular favourites of new investors,
who read of the extraordinary gains to be earned in the sector and jumped on
the bandwagon with little thought or research. As a result, many bought
stocks in companies they knew little about. As soon as the sector's
speculative bubble burst in mid-February, many of the unsophisticated
investors panicked and sold hurriedly.
At the same time the more experienced investors were getting out because
price/earnings ratios and technical charts were telling them that the sector
had peaked and was heading for a substantial correction.
Healthcare stocks also ran into heavy selling during the latter part of the
first quarter, with analysts blaming the losses on the uncertainty
surrounding healthcare legislation in this election year.
Health has been one of the biggest topics in the presidential debate so far,
and there is concern in the market that after the election the victorious
candidate might push sweeping health reforms through Congress.
The problems of the biotech and healthcare sectors has inevitably impacted
on the market for initial public offerings (IPOs). Between January 1991 and
the end of the first quarter this year an estimated Dollars 1.75bn was
raised through over 50 biotech IPOs as new and emerging companies rushed to
take advantage of the heavy demand from investors for biotech stocks. But in
recent weeks several planned IPOs have been shelved because of the sudden
absence of buyers.
The under-performance of small stock indices has also been caused by a
switch of funds into low-priced cyclical stocks. The high p/e ratios on many
growth stocks in the Nasdaq composite and the Russell 2000 at the start of
the year had set off alarm bells for some investors, who began selling out
of small growth stocks and into cyclical broader market stocks.
To investors, the recovering economy made cyclicals, whose earnings tend to
move in line with the economic cycle, look more attractive than emerging
growth stocks, whose earnings are more unreliable.
As for small value stocks, which can look slow and unexciting but which
usually produce a steady return over the long term, they offer a safe haven
with strong defensive qualities for investors tired of the roller-coaster
ride of biotechs.

FT  09 MAY 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei rises 6.2 per
cent on the week

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
WHILE the Nikkei average failed to continue its winning streak after rising
more than 1,000 points in two consecutive days, traders were heartened by an
increase in volume, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The 225-issue average closed down 34.93 at 18,375.95, up 6.2 per cent on the
week, after a high of 18,500.00 and a low of 18,172.42. Arbitrage-related
selling and profit-taking weighed down the index in early trading, but
buying by foreigners and investment trusts helped cut most of the losses.
Volume rose to 450m shares from 400m. Despite the fall in the Nikkei,
advances led declines by 623 to 378, with 137 issues remaining unchanged.
The Topix index of all first section stocks lost 0.32 to 1,374.38 and in
London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index up 0.56 at 1,106.89.
Traders said that sentiment was improving. Mr Takatoshi Okuyama at Daiwa
Securities said: 'We've probably confirmed the bottom, and more investors
are coming back in.' He added that the recent rise in share prices has
prompted investors to cover short positions.
Speculative issues were traded actively by dealers. Biotechnology issues
advanced, with Morinaga Milk, the most active issue of the day, up Y41 to
Y840 and Okamoto advancing Y100 to Y1,380. Shimadzu, a medical equipment
maker, rose Y25 to Y705 on the Aids theme.
Foreign investors sought high technology blue chips. Sony added Y80 to
Y4,480 while TDK rose Y40 to Y4,450. However, NEC fell Y30 to Y1,010 and
Matsushita retreated Y10 to Y1,430 on profit-taking.
Bank stocks lost ground on reports that four commercial banks, including
Sakura Bank, will bail out Taiheiyo Bank, a regional bank in financial
trouble due to an increase in bad loans. Sakura lost Y30 to Y1,040 and Fuji
Bank lost Y50 to Y1,440.
Kanebo, the cosmetics maker, fell Y14 to Y445. Investors were discouraged by
an announcement that the company will make a consolidated after-tax loss of
Y6.6bn compared to an earlier forecast of a profit of Y1bn.
In Osaka, the OSE average rose 138.88 to 20,893.70 in volume of 32m shares.
Dealers sought speculative issues while foreigners and investment trust were
seen bargain-hunting. Short-term trading lifted Ono Pharmaceutical by Y330
to this year's high of Y6,380.
Roundup
PACIFIC Rim markets were mixed while Bangkok regained some ground after
large falls this week.
HONG KONG declined after recent gains. The Hang Seng Index lost 21.39 to
5,608.19, but was 2.2 per cent higher on the week. Turnover was HKDollars
3.68bn.
HSBC Holdings fell HKDollars 1.50 to HKDollars 43.50 on news that it was
posting a formal offer document to Midland Bank shareholders valuing the UK
bank at some Pounds 3.4bn.
BANGKOK improved as investors anticipated an early resolution to the
political crisis. The SET index rose 22.17 to 732.89, but was down 3.7 per
cent on the week. Turnover was Bt4.37bn.
Bangkok Bank gained Bt20 to Bt680 and Siam Cement rose Bt10 to Bt518.
KUALA LUMPUR saw some interest in blue chip stocks. The composite index
closed up 2.15 to 605.71, a 2.3 per cent rise over the week. Turnover fell
to MDollars 107m from MDollars 112m.
Telecom advanced 30 cents to MDollars 12.90 while Genting lost 30 cents to
MDollars 12.60.
SEOUL fell on profit-taking. The composite index finished 4.09 lower at
599.25, for a 3.4 per cent decline on the week. Turnover was Won356bn.
AUSTRALIA drifted lower. The All Ordinaries index shed 2.3 to 1,663.6,
barely changed on the week. Turnover was ADollars 286m.
John Fairfax Holdings, making its market debut, closed up 18 cents at
ADollars 1.38. News Corp advanced 40 cents to ADollars 20.90 while Foster's
Brewing was 3 cents firmer at ADollars 1.80.

FT  09 MAY 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Milan weighed down by further
cash calls
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FURTHER cash calls depressed Milan yesterday while the end of the public
sector strike failed to lift Frankfurt. Paris was closed for a holiday,
writes Our Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT reacted with uncertainty to the settlement in the public sector
pay dispute. Some analysts noted that the agreement was a rebuff to the
government's efforts to keep wage rises below 5 per cent and that it would
give private sector workers the incentive to seek similar rises. The metal
unions are due to ballot members on strike action next week.
The DAX index closed down 2.63 at 1,748.18, but was 0.8 per cent higher on
the week. The FAZ index was 0.18 lower at 706.62, a gain of 0.8 per cent on
the week. Turnover fell to DM5.8bn from DM6.5bn.
Volkswagen advanced DM4.80 or 1.2 per cent to DM393.60, following positive
results earlier this week which prompted analysts to increase their 1992
profit forecasts.
BMW was also firmer, up DM8.50 to DM586 ahead of next Tuesday's annual
meeting, while Mercedes rose DM8 to DM605 after forecasting good 1992
prospects at its commercial vehicle division.
However, MAN, which expects sales at its truck arm for the year ending June
1992 to be up 14 per cent, lost DM6 to DM375.50. Some analysts said that the
prospect of strike action by metal workers hung over the stock. Mannesmann
shed DM4.30 to DM280.20 following the release of disappointing 1991 results
after Thursday's close.
Schering continued to weaken following poor first quarter figures earlier in
the week, closing down DM15 or 1.9 per cent at DM786. Hoechst lost 80 pfg to
DM254 on news that Petrofina was negotiating to buy its US polyethylene
plant.
MILAN staggered under the increasing weight of rights issues, following
Thursday's late announcement from the insurer Ras and fellow insurer
Assitalia's similar news yesterday morning. However, the market got some
support from Fiat and Montedison. Dealers were perplexed by the bad timing
of the rights issues, given the poor sentiment in the market, as well as the
lack of explanation as to why the funds were needed. The Comit index fell
4.08 to 493.33, down 1.9 per cent on the week, in turnover estimated at
L115bn after L113.6bn.
Ras, which resumed trading after Thursday's suspension dropped L2,030 or 9.7
per cent to L17,910 in heavy volume of 876,300 shares. Dealers said the
price was hit by one large seller from London, and that there was no sign
that Ras had stepped in to defend its share price. Its savings shares were
suspended twice because of the excessive weakness and failed to be
officially closed in spite of three attempts. It was quoted as low as
L10,750, compared with L13,260 before the announcement.
Fiat fell L15 to L5,135 but rebounded to L5,160, supported by Thursday's
good industry data. Montedison eased L4 to L1,485 but firmed to L1,490 later
in the session. Dealers said there was interest in the shares following some
buy notes from brokers and on talk that Montedison might sell all or part of
its US operations.
ZURICH rose on foreign buying of blue chips. The SMI Index rose 12.3 to
1,949.1, a 3.6 per cent gain on the week. Among banks, UBS registered shares
gained SFr15 to SFr805 while its bearers were SFr60 firmer at SFr3,900.
Takeover rumours sent Baloise Insurance registered shares up SFr90 to
SFr2,350.
STOCKHOLM recovered most of its losses caused by news that the government
had been forced to bail out Nordbanken. The Affarsvarlden general index rose
1.8 to 1,009.7, up 2.9 per cent on the week, as turnover reached SKr853m
from SKr787m.
The banking sector dropped 3.4 per cent on the news. SE Banken C shares were
down SKr4 or 7.8 per cent to SKr47.50. Nordbanken, which is already 77.3 per
cent owned by the government, rose 50 ore to SKr19.50.
Ericsson B ended SKr2 higher at SKr134 despite worse-than-expected first
quarter results. Volvo B jumped SKr9 to SKr445 on hopes of an early merger
with Renault.
BRUSSELS ended off the day's highs after hectic trading led by Petrofina,
which rose 1.5 per cent. Petrofina ended up BFr175 at BFr11,550, accounting
for half the day's volume of BFr1.6bn. The Bel-20 index added 13.09 to
1,211.36, up 1.6 per cent on the week.
AMSTERDAM closed slightly firmer. The CBS Tendency index advanced 0.1 to
130.1, for a 1 per cent gain on the week. Turnover was Fl 617m.
The publishing sector was strong on a positive report by ABN Amro Bank. VNU
put on 70 cents to Fl 90.50, but off an intraday year's high of Fl 91.50,
Elsevier advanced 50 cents to Fl 116.90 and Wolters Kluwer closed a net 30
cents higher at Fl 76.60 after going ex-dividend.
MADRID's general index rose 3.45 to 254.91 for a 2.48 per cent rise on the
week.

FT  09 MAY 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
STOCK INDEX futures powered ahead to reach record levels in busy trading
which saw the June contract on the FT-SE trade at a premium through out the
session, writes Joel Kibazo.
Having opened at 2,733, a squeeze in June developed within the first hour as
dealers rushed to cover short positions. The squeeze sent June soaring and
at the day's best a premium of 47 points to the underlying cash market was
recorded. The day's high of 2,672 was reached at around 1.30pm.
The market witnessed some large trades particularly from the big investment
houses such as James Capel in the dying minutes of the session.
June eventually closed at 2,766, a record high and up 25 on the previous
session, and around 23 points above its estimated premium to cash of about
18.
The LTOM also put in a strong performance with turnover reaching 40,896
contracts, with the FT-SE option recording a day's total of 11,372 lots.
Hanson, a strong feature in the equity market, was the day's top traded
stock option. It traded 2,898 lots with the August 240 calls the most
active. It was followed by British Gas, at 2,528. BP, Asda and Midland Bank
were also busy.

FT  09 MAY 92 / London Stock Exchange: Another closing record for the
Footsie
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JUST AS the equity market was closing at a new all-time high, dealers were
astonished to find that Goldman Sachs, one of the leading US investment
banks, had swooped to execute one of the most sought-after bought deals in
the market. It placed Hanson's 2.82 per cent stake in ICI, the chemicals
giant. One of Goldman's fiercest rivals in the London market said the deal
was; 'a beautifully timed and beautifully executed piece of stockbroking.'
'I'm sure we'll see a burst of takeover speculation in the so-called bid
favourites when the market opens on Monday,' was the reaction of a leading
marketmaker to the news.
Details of Goldmans' move were not known during market trading and therefore
had no impact on the share prices of either company although traders said
both stocks were being marked higher in unofficial trading. Hanson shares,
basking in the afterglow of a Pounds 28m profit on the purchase and sale of
the ICI shares, were being chased after-hours, dealers said.
The deal was seen as the icing on the cake for London's market operators
after a another scintillating performance by the equity market. This week's
half-point cut in domestic interest rates, a similar move by the French
authorities to cut their own rates and evidence that the UK economy may be
emerging from recession were the reasons behind some exceptionally heavy
domestic and overseas buying of the London market.
The FT-SE 100 share index settled at a record high of 2,725.7, up 23.8 on
the session, having earlier raced up to an peak of 2,734.8. Over the week,
the index has risen 65.9 points, extending its gain since news of the
Conservatives' general election victory to 289.3 points.
Dealers were surprised by the speed and substance of yesterday's gains. The
Footsie opened more than 6 points down but the weakness lasted less than an
hour. A surge in the Footsie future and heavy overseas buying followed the
latest burst of strength in sterling. The buying drove the Footsie up to an
intraday high of 2,734.8, up 32.9, before late profit-taking. The market's
latest surge confounded many observers who had expected the last session of
the account to trigger a burst of heavy profit-taking. Dealers were wary of
selling the market short.
Yesterday's turnover, just short of 900m, backed up the argument that there
has been a substantial inflow of foreign money into the UK market.
Retail, or customer business, in London remained at an exceptionally high
level, boosted by a series of big placings and big overseas buying.

FT  09 MAY 92 / Commodities and Agriculture (Week in the markets): Coffee
and cocoa at fresh lows
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD MOONEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SEEMINGLY inexorable slide in coffee prices remained the outstanding
feature of the commodities market this week. With technical chart signals
still pointing downwards, fundamentals bearish and further heavy producer
sales expected it was no surprise to see London Futures and Options Exchange
coffee values fall to fresh 22-year lows.
In New York, where the arabica variety grown chiefly in Latin America is
traded, the market steadied towards the end of the week on news that
Brazilian exporters will seek emergency measures to boost prices at a
meeting with their government next Monday; there was also talk of Colombia
taking a hand in action to stabilise prices. But that factor had little
impact on the contract in, mainly African, robusta coffee that is traded in
London.
A Dollars 17 fall yesterday left the July robusta futures price at Dollars
676 a tonne, down Dollars 52 on the week and Dollars 320 since the begining
of this year.
Stocks of coffee held in importing countries have reached 19m bags (60 kg
each), about twice the required level, according to Mr Peter Kettle, analyst
with ED &amp; F. Man, the London trade house. Against this background,
'producers have to sell for what they can get,' commented Mr Lawrence
Eagles, analysts with London futures broker GNI.
The same situation applies at present in the cocoa market. Consumers,
already well covered and aware that a rally of any size would be likely to
prompt heavy producer selling, are in no rush to buy. So modest producer
selling this week from the Ivory Coast, the biggest producer, and Ghana was
enough to send prices to fresh 16 1/2 -year lows. The London market's July
futures position touched Pounds 557 a tonne yesterday, before closing at
Pounds 565 a tonne, down Pounds 24 on the week.
At the London Metal Exchange the technical tightness that has been
distorting the price structure of the zinc market for some time at last
showed signs of easing, but not before it had driven the backwardation (cash
premium) against three months metal to Dollars 106 a tonne. In normal
circumstances forward metal would be at a premium to cash, reflecting the
cost of holding physical metal - principally warehousing charges, insurance
and lost interest on capital employed. The reversal of that price
relationship is associated with inadequate availability of metal for
immediate delivery, but with LME warehouse stocks of zinc standing at a
record level - they rose this week by 1,000 tonnes to 245,775 tonnes - the
apparent shortage has inevitably aroused suspicions of market manipulation.
As nervousness about the threatened supply squeeze faded the cash price
became vulnerable to the bearish fundamental and technical considerations
that had begun to depress the three months price last week. Falls over the
past three days cut the price by Dollars 38 a tonne and narrowed its premium
over three months metal to Dollars 82 a tonne. Cash zinc closed yesterday at
Dollars 1,349.50 a tonne, down Dollars 22 on the week, while the three
months price was at Dollars 1,267.50 a tonne, down Dollars 25.
The LME's strongest market was tin, where prices reached the highest levels
for 13 months. Yesterday's announcement of a 105-tonne fall in exchange
warehouse stocks to 11,955 tonnes and news of Brazilian plans to cut output
helped to push the cash price to Dollars 5,977.50 a tonne, up Dollars 107.50
on the week. And the three months price got tantalisingly close to the
Dollars 6,000 a tonne that traders have identified as the 'near-term
target', before ending Dollars 95 up at Dollars 5,982.50 a tonne.
Copper prices reversed early falls to end higher on the week. The cash price
rose Pounds 8.25 to Pounds 1,240.25 a tonne yesterday, encouraged by news of
a 4,300-tonne LME stocks fall to 275,350 tonnes.
In contrast aluminium stocks showed a rise of 15,250 tonnes to a new record
of 1,231,750 tonnes. But that appeared to be shrugged off and the cash price
ended the week Dollars 7.50 up at Dollars 1,297 a tonne.
Silver was the strongest of the precious metals markets, putting on 6 cents
yesterday to end 10 cents up on the week at Dollars 4.12 a troy ounce.
Traders said the rise was influenced by positive technical factors and a
renewal of optimism about prospects for an economic recovery in the US,
which was given further encouragement yesterday by the announcement of a
bigger-than-expected rise in US non-farm employment in April. US traders
pointed out, however, that there was stiff resistance around Dollars 4.15 an
ounce.

FT  09 MAY 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar stages good recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DOLLAR strengthened against the D-Mark yesterday after better than
forecast US employment figures indicated an upturn in the US economy in
April, writes James Blitz.
The market reacted optimistically to the non-farm payroll figures for April,
which showed a rise in employment of 126,000. As a result the dollar ended
up over a pfennig against the D-Mark, closing at DM1.6475 after a previous
close of DM1.6360.
However, analysts thought the jobs figures were not good enough to alter the
market belief that the US recovery is still rather dormant. Fears that the
US Federal Reserve might cut the Fed funds rate again are certain to
resurface next week. 'We can't rule out a further reduction in interest
rates, especially if next week's US retail sales figures come in on the weak
side,' said Mr Neil MacKinnon, chief economist of Yamaichi International in
London. That indicator, which the markets will watch out for closely on
Wednesday, showed only a 0.1 per cent monthly rise in March.
Sterling was, once again, among the most actively traded currencies of the
day, ending up half a pfennig against the D-Mark at DM2.9450. It is now
fifth from bottom of the EMS grid, having overtaken the Italian, French and
Danish currencies this week.
There were no new factors boosting the British currency yesterday, beyond
investor confidence in the one European country certain to have stable
government for the next five years. According to Mr Jim O'Neill, head of
research at Swiss Banking Corporation in London, the outlook for sterling
remains strong, with every possibility that it could soon test DM2.97.
'Sterling has been one of the most volatile currencies this year,' he said,
'with plenty of potential for profit and loss there.'
The D-Mark, by contrast, failed to gain from news that the damaging public
sector strike in Germany had finally ended, and lost out to most currencies
yesterday. The market seemed more concerned that the government had caved in
to the trade unions' demands, raising fears of inflation.
Like sterling, the French franc continued its week-long assault on the
German currency, with the D-mark ending at around FFr3.3630, compared to a
previous close of FFr3.3669.
Yen trading was, once again, very subdued yesterday. But the currency gave
up some of its recent gains after the Japanese Ministry of Finance said it
had no plans for injecting a new fiscal stimulus. This has raised fears that
the Japanese economy is being subjected to policy overkill, and the yen
closed down against the dollar at Y133.35 compared to Y132.70.

FT  09 MAY 92 / Money Markets: Rates unchanged
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
RATES in the sterling money market were mostly unchanged yesterday, despite
the pound's strong performance on the foreign exchange markets.
On Thursday, both sterling futures and interbank rates had reflected the
strong performance by the pound on the foreign exchange markets. But
yesterday, the market reverted to the view that 10 per cent base rate will
stay throughout the summer, following the Bank of England's 1/2 point cut
earlier this week.
Trade in sterling futures was extremely quiet with volume for the September
short sterling contract at around 8000 lots. The September contract ended at
90.27, implying that base rates five months from now will be 9.73 per cent.
Period rates in the interbank market were also mostly unchanged. The 3-month
rate again ended at 10 1/8 - 1/16 per cent, while the one-year rate was only
marginally lower at 10 1/16 -10 per cent. 'That bare difference between the
period rates reflects the market view that there is little chance of a base
rate change soon,' said a market analyst.
In the discount market, traders found it difficult to remove a shortage of
Pounds 2.35bn, the largest ever forecast by the Bank of England.
In early operations, the Bank purchased Pounds 2m of Band-1 Bank bills at 9
7/8 per cent, Pounds 50m of Band-3 Bank bills at 9 21/32 per cent, Pounds
44m of Band-4 Bank bills at 9 19/32 per cent and Pounds 600m of bills for
resale to the market in equal amounts on 28 and 29 May at an interest rate
of 9 15/16 per cent.
Later the Bank bought Pounds 33m of Band-3 Bank bills at 9 21/32 per cent,
Pounds 3m of Band-4 Bank bills at 9 19/32 per cent, and Pounds 800m for
resale to the market in equal amounts on 28 and 29 May at an interest rate
of 9 15/16 per cent.
In the afternoon, the Bank bought Pounds 650m of Band-1 bills at 9 7/8 per
cent, Pounds 34m of Band-2 and Pounds 2m of Treasury bills at 9 7/8 per
cent, Pounds 134m of Band-3 Treasury bills and Pounds 5m of Bank bills at 9
21/32 per cent, and Pounds 68m of Band-4 Bank bills at 9 19/32 per cent. The
overnight rate ended at around 9 3/4 per cent.
Ireland became the third EMS-member country this week to cut interest rates
after the Central Bank of Ireland cut both its overnight and short term
facility lending rates.
The overnight rate was cut to 7 1/4 per cent from 7 1/2 per cent, and the
short-term facility rate was reduced to 10 1/2 per cent.

   BONN, BERLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FRIED. KRUPP, the German steel, engineering and trading group shortly to be
merged with Hoesch, its former rival, is expecting a drop in both sales and
profits this year despite a 4 per cent increase in orders in the first
quarter, Mr Gerhard Cromme, chairman, said yesterday.
An expected strike among members of the IG Metall metal-working union will
also take its toll, mainly in the machinery divisions, he added.
Confirming a 2 per cent increase in sales last year to DM15bn (Dollars 9bn)
and a 2 per cent drop in orders, he said pre-tax profits for last year
totalled DM417m. Net earnings rose DM88m to DM305m.
Mr Cromme, who claimed that 'restructuring and rehabilitation' of the group,
started in 1988, was virtually completed last year, also warned of
unspecified 'pruning' in addition to the 1,800 job losses directly related
to the Hoesch merger.
Early orders, totalling DM3.6bn in the first quarter, could not be read as a
reliable indicator of overall prospects.
'The steel sector is confronted with a difficult situation with prices for
some products at 1980 levels,' he said. 'This price slump cannot be offset
even by the extensive rationalisation of recent years and the ongoing
structural measures.'
ADN, the financially stretched former state press agency of communist East
Germany, has been taken over by the west German domestic news service DDP,
Reuters reports from Berlin.

FT  09 MAY 92 / International Company News: Foster's faces asset write-down
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SYDNEY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FOSTER'S Brewing Group, Australia's biggest brewer, yesterday warned that
difficult economic conditions may force it to write down the value of its
remaining non-core assets.
Foster's foreshadowed the move in response to a query from the Australian
Stock Exchange about fluctuations in the group's share price, which fell
from ADollars 1.92 on Monday to a low of ADollars 1.77 on Thursday.
The group said it could not explain the fall, and assured the exchange that
no important announcements were about to be made which might have leaked
out.
However, Foster's said 'adjustments' to the carrying value of its assets
might have to be made 'in view of the uncertain and difficult economic
conditions prevailing, particularly in the Australian property market'.
The group wrote off ADollars 1.58bn (USDollars 1.19bn) in abnormal and
extraordinary losses in 1989/90, leading to a loss of ADollars 1.26bn. It
wrote off ADollars 277m in the following year, when the loss contracted to
ADollars 43m, and a further ADollars 120m in the first half of the current
year.
Foster's has been disposing of non-brewing assets since 1990, under a
recovery programme intended to re-establish the group as a pure brewing
business.
However, it has been unable to dispose of non-core assets with a book value
of ADollars 2.8bn, including finance assets valued at ADollars 1.6bn and
agribusiness and pastoral assets valued at more than ADollars 600m.
Analysts said much of the uncertainty in the group's shares was caused by
the financial instability of International Brewing Holdings (IBH), a private
company controlled by Mr John Elliott, which owns 38 per cent of Foster's.
IBH is due to submit a refinancing plan to its bankers later this month, and
could be placed in liquidation later this year if no agreement is reached.

HOARE Govett Japan, the Japanese arm of the London-based broker, will close
its Tokyo branch, becoming the seventh foreign-affiliated brokerage to
withdraw from Tokyo.
The sluggish Tokyo stock market forced Hoare Govett to close down its
Japanese equities operation last March.
Hoare Govett started its Tokyo securities operations in 1986. However, the
prolonged slump in the Tokyo stock market has forced smaller foreign houses
to close or scale down their operations, and Hoare Govett's closure of its
Japanese equities operations follows houses such as Chase Manhattan
Securities and BHF Securities.
Hoare Govett is currently partly owned by BankAmerica, the US bank which
merged with Security Pacific in April. ABN Amro Bank, based in Amsterdam,
signed a letter of intent this year to buy Hoare Govett from BankAmerica.

qualified
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
INDEPENDENT auditors have qualified the 1991 accounts of Corporacion Banesto
for failing to provision correctly for a stock acquisition that led to
losses and because it has five years of tax inspections pending, Reuter
reports from Madrid.
Banco Espanol de Credito SA-Banesto, the Spanish banking group which owns 72
per cent of Corporacion, confirmed the auditors' findings but had no other
comment.
Corporacion Banesto is a holding company for the industrial group of the
same name. It was created in 1990 after a restructuring of the bank's
industrial subsidiaries previously held through trust companies.
The auditors' report states that in September 1990 Corporacion guaranteed
Banesto loans to another subsidiary, Banesto Industrial Investments BII,
which Corporacion then acquired in June 1991 together with the loan
liability.
In December 1991, BII was wound up and its liabilities taken over by the
Corporacion, producing a loss of Pta9.73bn (Dollars 95m), part of which
corresponds to the 1990 fiscal year.
The auditors' report says that 'given the financial situation of BII at
December 1990 the consolidated accounts of (the Corporacion) to that date
should have included a provision for the potential losses that existed'.
It said the relevant provision in 1991 should have been presented as
'results from previous years' in the profit and loss account for that year.
BII's assets consisted of 972,108 Carburos Metalicos shares and an option on
841,656 additional shares in the same company.
It added that with tax inspections pending for the past five years, it was
impossible to quantify the company's tax liability.
Corporacion made a 1991 pre-tax profit of Pta3.79bn after provisions of
Pta28.4bn.

Warner division
</HEADLINE>

   SAN FRANCISCO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
IBM may make a substantial investment in Time Warner Entertainment, the
film, television and cable division of the entertainment empire, in
connection with plans the companies are believed to be discussing to create
a large-scale joint venture.
IBM says it is seeking partners in the entertainment, consumer electronics
and telecommunications fields to create an independent venture that would
offer 'interactive multimedia services' to homes and businesses throughout
the US.
'Movies on demand' will be one of the first applications of the planned
service. Subscribers will be able to watch a film of their choice at any
time. Other potential uses include 'interactive television', in which
viewers could, for example, answer questions on a quiz show. IBM also
envisages educational and information service applications.
Time Warner is believed to have become the primary focus of IBM's
discussions. An alliance between the two would combine IBM's information
processing expertise with Time Warner's entertainment, media and
distribution capabilities.
Other partners, including an electronics manufacturer, would be needed to
provide equipment such as the 'decoder' boxes for use with television sets.
A likely choice is Toshiba, which with C. Itoh, the Japanese trading
company, has agreed to take a 12.5 per cent equity stake in Time Warner
Entertainment for Dollars 500m each.
An investment of similar proportions by IBM would provide Time Warner with
much needed cash.
The entertainment company has been seeking investments to reduce the
enormous debt it incurred in its creation by the merger of the former Time
and Warner Communications groups in early 1990.
IBM's primary goal is, however, to find a partner that would enable it to
capitalise on its investments in 'multi-media' technology, which apply
computer technology to providing a rich mix of video, graphics and text
information.

The Tokyo-based company, with outstanding borrowings estimated at Y25bn
(Dollars 188m), was apparently a victim of stock market speculation since
its core business was profitable. But the stock market collapse had created
huge appraisal losses.
Meanwhile, the Tokyo Stock Exchange, which suspended trading in the stock on
Thursday, is investigating unusually large turnover of Lec shares earlier
this week and is also seeking information from the company on why it was not
informed earlier about the filing.
Lec, listed on Tokyo's second section, is the first listed company to fail
since Kokko Steel Works collapsed in August 1986, and its court application
yesterday was seen as a symbol of the still serious financial problems
facing some manufacturers who diversified into stock speculation.
The Lec failure also raises questions about the willingness of Japanese
banks to prop up all of their troubled clients. Bank officials have
indicated that they are willing to back traditional customers, unless those
companies' problems stem from stock trading.
Founded in 1957 and listed in 1985, Lec is one of Japan's largest makers of
plastic kitchenware, bronze sculptures, candle stands and bathroom goods.
Sales for the fiscal year just ended were forecast to rise about 35 per cent
to Y30bn, but revenue was not enough to cover the appraisal losses and
depreciation charges.
The company had forecast a pre-tax loss of Y640m, but, until yesterday, was
confident that an upturn in the Japanese economy in coming months would
enable it to avoid a court filing.
About 2 per cent of the company's production was exported, and foreign
investors hold about 0.6 per cent of its stocks.
Nippon Housing Loan, Japan's top-ranked home loan institution, revised its
current profit estimate downwards by 87.5 per cent to Y770m from Y6.01bn for
the year ended March 1992. The company now estimates that it made a net
after-tax loss of Y6.49bn for the year, from a previously-estimated Y3.04bn
profit.

FT  09 MAY 92 / International Company News: Petrofina sees 'marked drop'

<TEXT>
PETROFINA, the Belgian oil, gas and petrochemicals group, is likely to
suffer a 'marked drop' in profits in the first half of 1992, its chief
executive warned yesterday.
Mr Francois Cornelis told shareholders that although medium-term forecasts
on the company's different activities were good, short-term improvements
would depend on an increase in the price of gas in the US, improved refining
margins and the absorption of excess capacity in the petrochemicals sector.
Speaking before the shareholders' meeting, Mr Cornelis also confirmed that
Petrofina, Belgium's largest industrial group, was in talks with Hoechst,
the US chemicals company, about buying its high-density polyethylene
activities in the US. Hoechst has a capacity of 150,000 tonnes a year in
polyethylene. Mr Cornelis refused to expand on the progress of the talks.
Petrofina suffered a 25 per cent decline in net consolidated profits last
year - to BFr16.3bn (Dollars 478m) from BFr21.7bn. In the first half of 1991
it made BFr10.26bn, marginally up on 1990.
Mr Cornelis said the group was well-positioned for the future, and he placed
particular emphasis on the likely impact of the BFr29bn investment to
improve the efficiency of Petrofina's Antwerp refinery.
'From the middle of 1994, (the investment) ought to put our refinery at the
leading edge of our business in terms of added value (oil products) and the
environment,' he told shareholders.

FT  09 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Brussels consultants wait in the wings for
EC inquiry decision - The Battle For Midland
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL

<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TRADITIONAL Westminster-style lobbying of the European Commission is not
much use to the Midland bidders and counter-bidders.
Until the later stages of EC investigations, the procedure is governed by
strict rules laying out the timetable and conditions of such inquiries and
the main decisions are taken by Sir Leon Brittan, the competition
commissioner, and Mr Jacques Delors, commission president.
MEPs - heavily lobbied when it comes to votes on EC legislation - have no
direct influence over the merger control procedure.
As a result, the banks have not yet used Brussels' myriad public affairs
consultancies and lobbyists. Instead, all three have deployed their lawyers
to extract information from the commission, and present their case in the
dry legal and economic terms which the EC's competition officials
understand.
The Hongkong Bank's bid is still in the opening four-week stage of the
Brussels inquiry. Sir Leon clarified the situation on Thursday when he said
he believed the Hongkong Bank's bid fell under Brussels' jurisdiction, while
Lloyds' counter-bid would not.
It is Sir Leon and Mr Delors who will decide after four weeks whether a
four-month inquiry should be launched, and only in the latter stages of that
process will the potential votes of the 15 other commissioners begin to
count.
Last year's investigation into a Franco-Italian bid for de Havilland, the
Canadian aircraft maker, was eventually blocked by the commission - its most
controversial merger decision to date.
In the final stages of the inquiry, commissioners and their officials were
dogged by lobbyists representing all the parties, proving that in a tight
corner Brussels consultants can be just as aggressive as their Westminster
and Washington counterparts.

FT  09 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Lobbying for positions as MPs begin to take
an interest - The likely moves at Westminster / The Battle For Midland
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WITH Parliament stumbling back into life and the future of Midland Bank,
once the world's largest, lodged firmly in the hands of regulators, the
political lobbying process at Westminster is swinging into action.
All three of the main protagonists - Lloyds Bank, Hongkong and Shanghai
Banking Corporation and their target Midland - have retained political
consultants in addition to a clutch of financial and public relations
advisers. The consultants will play a key role in ensuring their clients'
messages get through to members of parliament.
But the process cuts both ways, providing parliamentarians with a channel
through which to broadcast their concerns to the leading companies.
The direct influence of the average backbencher on government
decision-makers might be slight or non-existent. But the recent problems of
the Lloyd's insurance market are a good illustration of the impact that a
relatively small number of aggrieved MPs can have if they feel they are not
getting a fair hearing.
Such is the geographic spread of the businesses involved in the battle for
Midland that a large number of MPs are likely to take a serious interest.
There can be few in England and Wales who do not have some Midland or Lloyds
employees among their constituents. Some are already receiving letters about
the possible consequences of any deal.
Early comments suggest that one of Lloyds Bank's toughest tasks will be to
set MPs' minds at rest as to the likely effect of its proposals on
employment levels and competition.
There is a quite widely held view at Westminster that the degree of
competition is already inadequate, especially in corporate banking. A
reduction from four to three in the number of clearers is hardly calculated
to improve matters.
Hongkong may have to counter claims that the current regulatory procedures
give foreign bidders an effective advantage at the expense of British
companies. The point was raised yesterday by Mr Keith Hampson, the
Conservative MP for Leeds North West and a member of the Commons select
committee on trade and industry, in a letter to the Financial Times.
In lobbying terms, it was Lloyds which set the ball rolling some 10 days
ago, sending a letter signed by Sir Jeremy Morse, its chairman, to all MPs.
He argued that its proposed offer was in the public interest and that the
Hongkong Bank proposals did not address 'any of the fundamental problems in
the UK banking sector'. The bank has hired GJW Government Relations as its
political lobbyist.
Hongkong, which has retained Lowe Bell Communications as its political
adviser, and Midland, which is using Ian Greer Associates, are both expected
to write to MPs. Bifu, the banking union, has already done so, sending a
dossier to MPs and British Euro MPs arguing that a Lloyds takeover would be
harmful to the UK economy.
Next week, the process will take a fresh turn when Conservative backbenchers
are expected to have an opportunity to meet senior executives from both
Hongkong Bank and Lloyds.
The usual format for such gatherings, which generally last about an hour, is
for a brief presentation followed by a question and answer session. Mr Tim
Smith, the Conservative MP for Beaconsfield, who served as vice-chairman of
the Tory backbench finance committee in the last parliament, played a
leading role in arranging the meetings.
If lobbying efforts then proceed according to type, selected MPs can expect
to be invited to lunch or dinner to discuss the situation further.
Typically, one representative from the client organisation would be present
for each MP who attended.
Subsequently, guests displaying a particular interest will often be
consulted further by an MP or another individual with close ties to the
client. MPs who perform such tasks on behalf of companies or other
interested parties are known colloquially as 'gophers'.
Several MPs have links of one kind or another with the main protagonists and
their advisers. But few expect to play a significant role as the contest
develops.
Mr Hugh Dykes, the Conservative MP for Harrow East, said he would not get
involved unless asked, and that would be unusual. Mr Dykes is a shareholder
in Dewe Rogerson, Lloyds' public relations adviser.
Mr Jeremy Bray, the Labour MP for Motherwell South and Bifu consultant, said
that anything he wrote or said on the subject would be in the public domain.
Mr Hampson, who was retained by GJW until last summer and has close
political links with Mr Heseltine, has emphasised that he has had no
discussions with Lloyds about its proposed offer and has no financial
interest in the outcome.
Other MPs with current or former ties include Mr Quentin Davies, the Tory MP
for Stamford and Spalding, a director of Dewe Rogerson Consultants and Sir
Peter Tapsell (C Lindsey East), who played a significant part in negotiating
the purchase of James Capel by Hongkong Bank but no longer has any
connection with the stockbroker.
One ex-MP who will be closely involved is Mr Francis Maude, the former
Treasury minister who has become an adviser to Mr William Purves, the
Hongkong Bank chairman. Mr Maude's appointment was partly at the behest of
Mr Alastair Ross Goobey, a former Treasury adviser who recently returned to
James Capel.
Mr Stephen Sherbourne, whose career includes spells as both political
secretary to Mrs Margaret Thatcher and head of office to Mr Edward Heath, is
in charge of the Hongkong account at Lowe Bell.

Mr Brian Pearse, Midland Bank's chief executive, is likely to enjoy a
windfall of more than Pounds 600,000 if either Hongkong Bank's or Lloyds'
bid for his bank succeeds, it emerged yesterday. Details of Midland
directors' share options published by Hongkong as part of its formal offer
show that when he joined Midland a year ago, Mr Pearse was given an option
to buy 300,000 Midland shares at Pounds 2 each any time in the next 10
years. Both bids value Midland's shares at more than Pounds 4.

Sir, Your leader, 'The challenge for the Labour party' (April 30), was most
perceptive.
Labour said that it no longer worshipped the Clause Four commitment to
public ownership, Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament and the unions. It lost
because it did not get rid of the men who all their lives had worshipped at
those shrines. Those have now become, and are seen to be, yesterday's men.
You suggest that if Mr John Smith be elected, his first job will be to
deunionise the party. Can he? He is not only a union sponsored MP, but has
made it clear, by letting it be known almost before the leadership campaign
began, that he had strong union support - and so was a yesterday's man.
I am a Conservative worker. I hope Mr Brian Gould will win, for every
government needs an effective opposition. Mr Gould might produce that. Mr
Smith cannot.

FT  09 MAY 92 / Letter: Rent review structure 'nonsense' economically
harmful
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr KEITH HATTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, David Simpson's letter, 'Value of a tenant in US' (April 28), overlooks
an essential point.
Upon assignment, the new tenant must satisfy the landlord that its financial
strength is adequate to meet the obligations under the lease. Why not then
release the original tenant from further obligation relating to premises in
which he no longer has any commercial interest?
The refusal to do so is only one of many ways in which the UK property
industry, by seeking to please investing institutions, harms the prospects
of its wealth-generating customers and thus of the economy as a whole.
Why are tenants asked to take on leases of up to 25 years when most cannot
realistically plan more than five years ahead? How many businesses would
have survived the recession had they been able to downsize their property
requirements in a much shorter time scale?
The rent review structure is a nonsense. In boom times, rents rocket as new
tenants speculate on future properity and agree record rental levels. These
are then imposed on other nearby tenants as evidence of the current market.
Yet when market rents fall, those of existing leases cannot because of the
upward-only structure of the review. The theoretical basis of review -
willing landlord, willing tenant and vacant building - is exactly that.
And when market rents fall, why can a tenant not chose to sub-let his
building at the new rent if he is willing to fund the difference? Because
the structure of his lease will prevent it in order that the value of the
investment is not damaged. It is time for tenants to wield the power they
hold and for major occupiers to make a stand.
It is also time for a service which seeks only to represent the interests of
wealth-generating tenants. For it is not only landlords who will resist the
changes needed. The larger commercial property agents will not risk
upsetting their land-owning clients while tenants meekly accept commercial
absurdities.

</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Cato the Elder ended every speech with the demand that Carthage must be
destroyed. Vanessa Houlder is becoming almost as repetitive in her gloomy
prognostications about Docklands (The property market, May 8). The
difference is that, unlike Ms Houlder, Cato did not use selective
quotations.
She correctly quotes the ADT architectural guide as saying that 'London's
Docklands contains one of the worst collections of late 20th century
buildings to be seen anywhere in the world'. But she omits the
counter-balance - the guide also states: 'And yet it is to Docklands that
you must go to find some of the best British architecture of the 1980s. The
gems are few, but, compared with anywhere else in the UK today, the
concentration is high and the quality rare.'
One would expect Financial Times writers to be aware of Docklands
architectural successes. After all, your own print works in East India Dock
Road has won eight architectural awards and commendations, and is described
in the ADT guide as 'beyond doubt, the finest building in Docklands to
date'.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, With reference to the Mayor of Cologne's article, 'Bomber Harris: 'a
tactless choice'' (May 2), I have already stated, and repeat, that the
statue of Sir Arthur Harris is a memorial to 55,000 of our dead comrades and
their commander, erected in our own Royal Air Force church precincts, in our
own country, alongside a memorial to the achievements of colleagues in
Fighter Command.
It is a belated tribute to the dead of a prolonged and bitter battle,
immensely important to the ground forces which finally defeated the Germany
of Hitler and is intended in part to redress the official neglect of their
achievement.
The publicity has all come from German sources and the effort to portray Sir
Arthur Harris as a war criminal is deeply resented. Churchill, Roosevelt and
other allied leaders ordered the strike at the heart of the Third Reich and
knew its value to the ultimate defeat of that monstrous regime.
The surviving members of Bomber Command deeply regret the loss of civilian
life, unfortunately unavoidable in a desperate combat, but simply assert our
right to mourn and commemorate our dead comrades.

FT  09 MAY 92 / Tough choices now kitty is bare: The German people are
resisting the costs of reunification
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By QUENTIN PEEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The sight of rotting garbage piling up in normally immaculate marketplaces,
of empty trams, cancelled trains and silent airports, has done more to worry
the world about the state of Germany than a barrage of budget deficit
statistics.
Throw in the rise of right-wing parties in the polls, the palpable confusion
in the heart of the ruling coalition, left-wing riots on the streets of
Berlin, and the apparent collapse of government resistance to trade union
pressure in the latest public sector strike, and it all adds up to an image
of a Germany in serious crisis.
From the inside, it does not look so catastrophic.
To be sure, there is a malaise in the land. In a country which has become
used to steadily rising material well-being, there is a gloomy conviction
that it cannot go on for ever. There is also a dawning awareness of the
challenge ahead of uniting a country divided not just ideologically but
psychologically for 40 years. But it is not yet a crisis.
Take the public sector strike, 11 days of severe disruption to the life of
ordinary citizens, the first such stoppage in 18 years, and the worst in the
public sector since the war. It may have caused consternation to the outside
world, but ordinary Germans took it in their stride. It was a thorough
inconvenience to be without trams and buses, without garbage collection and
with erratic mail services. The overwhelming response was to get on with the
job as best one could. There were very few incidents of picket-line
violence. There was a surprising degree of public sympathy for the strikers.
Bicycle shops and car hire companies did a roaring trade.
'In such a situation, the Germans have proved far more relaxed than in the
old days,' says Mr Jochen Thies, editor of Europa Archiv, a foreign policy
magazine. 'In the 1950s and 1960s it would have been much more traumatic.
The fact that we were able to handle a strike of almost two weeks is a sign
of being very normal. We were not crying for the state to intervene, as we
would have in the past.'
As for the 5.4 per cent strike settlement, which comes against a background
of doom-laden warnings of rising inflation, bankrupt budgets, and which
stands as a red rag to the Bundesbank to hike its interest rates once more,
it is all being taken with remarkable equanimity in the finance houses of
Frankfurt.
'Naturally the deal is too high in terms of what we can afford overall, in
the economy and for the public purse,' says Mr Jurgen Pfister, head of
economic research at Commerzbank. 'But look at last year, when it was 7 per
cent. It would have been naive to expect that after that we could get it
down to 4. Even if 5.4 is too high, it is not so bad in those terms.'
He adds: 'The stock market is not bothered. Investors discounted the strike.
People are still looking a bit anxiously at the Bundesbank. The commercial
banks have put their own rates up and put a squeeze on credit. If it were
just a question of prices, wages and the exchange rate, it would be five to
one against any interest rate increase. The only negative sign is the money
supply.'
Last week, Mr Helmut Schlesinger, president of the Bundesbank, sought to
discourage the 'almost daily debate and discussion of the last and next
decision of the central bank; monetary policy is in our view fundamentally a
medium and long-term business'. He gave no hint of any intention to increase
rates but he did warn that, with money supply growth running at an annual
rate of 8 per cent in the first quarter, it was 'too early for any monetary
all-clear signal'.
This gives little encouragement to other European governments which are
seeking to cut their own interest rates to stimulate growth. The unruffled
response in Frankfurt was expressed by Mr Hans-Helmut Kotz at the Deutsche
Girozentrale. 'The strike was obviously unnecessary,' he says. 'The end
result could have been agreed with less damage. But there is no serious
economic damage, and the figure is exactly what we have already written into
our spreadsheets: around 5.5 to 6 per cent. It is still a significant
slowdown on last year.'
And yet there is a mood of growing unease in the country, a fear of economic
recession, a disaffection with the political establishment, and a rising
protest vote in the polls for the fringe groups like the radical right and
the Greens.
Yesterday's poll by the Allensbach opinion research institute revealed that
the numbers showing 'anxiety' about the state of affairs in the country have
risen sharply in the past two months - to 74 per cent in the west, and 80
per cent in in October 1990, the comparable figures were below 40 per cent
in the west, and below 50 in the east.
As for the main political parties, they are also almost uniformly on the
slide: Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian Democrats (CDU) and the Bavarian
Christian Social Union (CSU) are down from 36.6 to 32.2 per cent. The
opposition Social Democrats (SPD) are scarcely better on 33.9 per cent, and
the Free Democrats (FDP), junior partner in the coalition, have slipped from
12 to 11.6 per cent.
In contrast, the right-wing Republicans are up from 4.6 to 8.5 per cent, and
the Greens from 10.1 to 10.6 per cent. Both would easily win seats in a
future parliament.
So what is up? It all comes back to the traumatic process of unification.
The euphoria of those days when the Berlin Wall came down has worn off, and
only the hangover remains. The trouble was that the German people were
persuaded - at least in the west - that they would not have a hangover. They
were told by Mr Kohl that it could be done for free. And now they are bitter
that they are beginning to pay a real price in the form of higher taxes,
higher prices and lower pay rises.
Reunification requires such financial sacrifice, but also change in
ingrained thinking. Old assumptions die hard.
Last week a middle-ranking civil servant gazed morosely at his lunchtime
asparagus, and complained about his pay. 'If the government is only prepared
to pay 4.8 per cent to higher officials, that means I am going to get
practically nothing above the rate of inflation,' he declared. His unstated
assumption was that, whatever the state of the budget or the national
economy, he deserved a real pay rise above inflation every year.
The strike tells the same story. The conviction of the trade unions is that
only their members - the little people - are paying the cost of unification.
They point to the string of record profits recorded last year by almost all
the big banks and manufacturers, as they reaped the windfall of new
(subsidy-financed) spending in the east.
Chancellor Kohl has simply failed to get it across to the great mass of the
population that the kitty is bare. It is partly his fault, because he
promised unification could be accomplished without tax increases. It is
partly because nobody seems to want to hear.
Mr Theo Waigel, the finance minister, insists that the central government
deficit can be brought down from DM45bn (Pounds 15.3bn) this year to DM25bn
in 1995.
His colleague Mr Jurgen Mollemann, the economics minister, has suggested the
deficit could equally rise to DM55bn over the same period.
The public sector strike settlement in itself may not be too disastrous. It
will add DM16bn to total public sector spending, including the postal system
and railways. The cost to the central government alone will be DM2.3bn. That
is close enough to what was allowed for.
What is more serious is what comes next. Industry is next in line for a
bruising battle, with IG Metall, the mighty engineering trade union, IG Bau,
the construction workers, and IG Druck, the printers, all calling warning
strikes or working to rule in support of their pay claims. The government's
5.4 per cent (or 5.1 per cent if it is averaged over the full 12 months)
will almost inevitably become the floor below which no new deal can be done.
The public sector pay deal 'ignores the economic realities and the financial
constraints on the public purse', the German industry federation (BDI) said
yesterday. 'It is damaging to the whole economy, and can in no way be a
yardstick for the coming wage agreements in the industrial sector.' That
would appear a forlorn hope.
The other concern lies at the heart of government - central government, the
states, even the communes. There is a doubt that they have the political
will to bring their combined deficits under control.
The truth is that for years Germany has succeeded in buying itself the
consensus on which its coalition governments, and its social and industrial
harmony, depends.
'We have thrown a lot of money at problems in the last two years alone,'
says Mr Thomas Kielinger, editor of the Rheinische Merkur, a weekly
newspaper. 'There was the Gulf war, unification, eastern Europe. We now have
to choose options and set priorities. That will require a new awakening and
this society will have to review its agenda.
'That is a tall order to ask of people used to having money left over to
throw at problems. They feel threatened by the advent of the need to make
choices.'
Given that challenge, clear leadership is required. That is where Chancellor
Kohl, with his instinctive commitment to the consensual school of coalition
government, is under fire. The Allensbach poll shows a leap from 14 per cent
to 22 per cent in the last month of those saying government is too weak.
Yet Germans are torn on the issue. Would they have preferred a government
which stood up to the unions, and smashed them, like Mrs Margaret Thatcher
did in Britain? 'No, we had enough of that sort of leadership with Hitler,'
one senior diplomat said on Thursday after the settlement. 'Chancellor Kohl
hasn't come out of this too badly.'
That view is common enough in Germany, which means the country has probably
got the government it deserves and wants: a muddled coalition which does not
threaten anyone. It is the mentality revealed by a government negotiator as
he emerged from Thursday's pay talks: 'We are damned to agreement.'

FT  09 MAY 92 / Comrades in the classroom struggle: The two Tories behind
Wandsworth's schools revolution
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The backstreets of Wandsworth in south-west London are the last place to
seek revolutionaries. But in Mr Edward Lister and Mr Donald Naismith, the
Tory borough's chairman of education and his chief officer, it has the
archetypal subversive duo: passionate in their cause, determined to confound
received wisdom, with a blueprint - in both senses - for every ill. Their
joint cause is selective education; the cursed creed, comprehensivisation.
And the blueprint? Smaller, specialised, state schools selecting their
pupils and competing for custom.
The plan is raising a storm in the part-deprived, part-gentrified borough,
an ill-fitting amalgam of Battersea, Tooting and Putney. Last week came the
latest instalment. Mr Naismith presented a paper to Mr Lister's education
committee, acknowledging the opposition of head teachers to the interviewing
of prospective pupils and the adoption of criteria (besides where they live)
for selection, only to conclude: 'The heavy reliance on the concept of
equality of opportunity in educational policy should not, perhaps, go
unchallenged. It may be argued that too limited an interpretation has
traditionally been placed on 'equality' and too narrow a view taken of
'opportunity', and that the reality facing parents and pupils has fallen
well short of the ideal the phrase represents.'
A page on, in Mr Lister's recommendation, comes the sting. A plan is to be
put out to consultation for the introduction of formal selection into the
admissions procedure of the three remaining comprehensives under
Wandsworth's control. (The borough's eight other state-funded schools - city
technology colleges, church and grant-maintained schools - already select or
are beyond the council's reach). 'Matching', not 'selection', is the
catchword: 'to provide schools which offer different value-oriented
education and training to suit the varied needs of pupils . . . schools must
be better matched to pupils.'
How they are to be so 'matched' is unclear. By ability, parental commitment,
or vocation - and if by the first two, what about the failures? 'Choice
centres' for parents of such children is Mr Lister's response. The extent of
the 'choice' open to their customers is left to the imagination.
Whatever you think of the ideas, though, you have to admire the duo's gusto.
Rough attacks on community comprehensives, the social democratic vision for
achieving true equality of opportunity, may still lack respectability. Yet
Mr Lister and Mr Naismith have the courage to preach and proselytise what
most of the chattering classes just whisper  - before, more often than not,
packing their offspring off to private schools, a world apart from most
pupils and parents at the typical inner-city comp.
Mr Naismith, 54, a career south London education officer with the prime
ministerial ear, is quite open about the end product he envisages. 'We want
a mixed economy in education,' he says. 'We have never argued that all
schools should be selective, but if the only choice in an area is six
neighbourhood comprehensives, the local authority is failing in its duty.'
The product of a 'no-nonsense' grammar school in Bradford, Mr Naismith was a
1960s fan of Lord Boyle, the Tory more responsible than any other for the
comprehensive experiment: 'Nowadays I am sure he would have seen the
national curriculum as the best road to opportunity for all.'
Standards are Mr Naismith's refrain, and he has the facts at his fingertips.
In 1990, when Wandsworth took over its schools from the Inner London
Education Authority, four in 10 of the borough's school-age population were
educated outside its education system - half of them in the independent
sector, half migrating west, many to leafy Richmond. Now it is below three
in 10. Of those 16-year-olds attending the borough's schools, the proportion
leaving without any - any - GCSE passes was 19.3 per cent in 1989; now it is
12.6 per cent, against an inner-London average of 17.9 per cent and a
national average of 7.8 per cent. Comparisons with neighbouring Lambeth are
stark. 'We have a lot of catching up to do,' he adds, 'but on such figures
we should be judged - and rightly so.'
Mr Lister, 42, is tipped to win today's contest for the leadership of
Wandsworth council. Like his predecessor, Sir Paul Beresford, he has an eye
on higher things - but compromise is not a word wont to fall from his lips,
and his prospects may depend on the selective creed finding a place in
Majorism.
Mr Lister's political past extends far beyond education. Over the past
decade he has chaired most of Wandsworth's leading service committees, and
shares Mr Naismith's grasp of figures to justify the borough's 'flagship'
status. Contracting out - 'saved us Pounds 26m over five years'. Libraries -
'two libraries out of nine have closed but the book stock and average issues
per head are far higher than Lambeth's'. Housing - '17,000 of our 40,000
units sold in the last decade, paying for a capital programme without rival
in London'.
Underlying it is a firm commitment to local government. Tendering and
opting-out will not, pace Nicholas Ridley, result in Wandsworth council
meeting just once a year to hand out contracts. 'It will give us time for
our real job: monitoring standards, encouraging diversity and, yes, picking
up the pieces when things go wrong.'
'The brighter borough' is Wandsworth's slogan. 'Things are brighter,' says
Mr Lister in earnest. Should he become captain of the flagship today, he
will doubtless place a spotlight on a larger agenda for reform.

FT  09 MAY 92 / Japan fears trend to protectionism
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Japanese government warned yesterday that the collapse of the communist
bloc could lead to increased protectionism, as a sense of common purpose
among western countries which encouraged the trend toward freer trade had
now eroded.
In an annual white paper on international trade, the government said the
disappearance of this shared political purpose could encourage countries to
'pursue their own short-term domestic interests at the expense of the
world's general benefit'.
The paper also called for continuing trade reforms within Japan, which has
just reported a record surplus of Dollars 113bn on its trade account for
fiscal 1991, and is facing increasing pressure from Washington to open
markets and make business practices more transparent.
In language similar to that used by US trade negotiators, the report said
that increased opportunities for foreign suppliers in the Japanese market
'will benefit not only foreign corporations, but Japanese consumers as
well'.
The report noted that in 1991, when Japanese economic growth slowed, the
value of imports rose by only 0.8 per cent, the smallest increase since
1986. It said the causes were the collapse of the financial 'bubble',
leading to a fall in luxury imports and slower capital spending by Japanese
companies.
However, Japan's exports rose by 9.6 per cent, and the paper said that about
half the increase was due to expanded trade with south-east Asian countries
and the other newly-industrialised economies of Asia. As for trade with the
European Community, Japan recommended that EC companies should 'boost
competitive power' in manufacturing industry.
'EC corporations have to make the most of their sales and
product-development strength, and construct close co-operative ties with
non-EC corporations possessing high technology - his can be done by
providing intermediate goods and taking part in product development,' it
said.
The paper, prepared by the Ministry of International Trade and Industry
(Miti) and approved yesterday by the cabinet, conceded that the 'enhancement
of industrial efficiency has not proportionally enhanced the Japanese
standard of living' and that infrastructure must be improved.
'We should utilise the surplus supply capacity and savings to build a social
infrastructure instead of exporting our products and financing other
countries' investments,' it recommended.
'These efforts to emphasise Japanese demand rather than supply will help to
reduce the Japanese macro-economic imbalance, to mitigate trade friction,
and to encourage the world economy to grow.'

<DATELINE>
   KUALA LUMPUR
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
DAIHATSU is to help launch Malaysia's second national car project, Reuter
reports from Kuala Lumpur.
Daihatsu, which is partly owned by Toyota, was asked by Malaysian prime
minister, Dr Mahathir Mohamad, last year to help build a car of below
1,000cc and costing not more than 20,000 ringgit (Pounds 4,400).
Malaysia's first national car, the Proton Saga with engine capacity of 1,300
and 1,500 cc, was launched in 1985 in a joint-venture between the government
and Mitsubishi. Its cost has shot up from around 18,000 ringgit to between
35,000 and 40,000 ringgit.
Proton produces about 100,000 vehicles a year, with 15,000 exported.
Dr Mahathir said the second car project will be a venture between Daihatsu
and the private sector but the government would offer the same incentives it
gave to Proton.
These would include exemption from import duty of components from Japan.
Daihatsu's local partners are to be UMW Holdings, which assembles Toyota
cars in Malaysia, state-owned investment agency Permodalan Nasional which
has a controlling stake in UMW, and the local Daihatsu distributor.
The car will be based on Daihatsu's K-car (mini-car).

FT  09 MAY 92 / Fall in jobless shows sluggish US recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FIGURES showing the first fall in US unemployment for nine months were
yesterday seen as further evidence that a sluggish recovery is underway.
The Labour Department said the unemployment rate fell to 7.2 per cent last
month compared with 7.3 per cent in March. Non-agricultural employment rose
126,000 to just over 109m, about twice the increase expected in financial
markets. This was the third consecutive monthly increase in non-farm
employment after a setback during the winter.
'It's a crawl, but a crawl up', said Mr Allen Sinai, chief economist at the
Boston Group, an economic consultancy. He said employment was rising at
about half the rate normal at the start of an economic recovery.
Mr William Brown, chief economist at J P Morgan, said the figures indicated
positive economic growth but 'not a fully-fledged recovery'. Many analysts
expect the economy to continue expanding at about the 2 per cent annual rate
registered in the first quarter.
Few economists rule out the possibility of another small cut in interest
rates if the economy fails to gather momentum. The Federal Reserve, the
central bank, has failed to prevent the money supply once again falling
below its 2.5 to 6.5 per cent growth target band.
The composition of last month's employment increase did little to generate
confidence. Job creation was centred in business services, health care and
the retail trade. Payrolls were flat in manufacturing and construction - the
sectors which usually lead the economy out of recession. The jobs report
follows a Fed survey this week indicating a slight improvement in retail
sales and manufacturing production. However, the pace of recovery of both
consumer demand and residential housing appears to have tailed off recently.

FT  09 MAY 92 / Chevron wins deal in Kazakhstan oilfields
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CHEVRON Corporation, the fourth largest US oil company, has signed a
long-awaited agreement with the republic of Kazakhstan that could lead to
the multi-billion dollar development of one of the world's largest new
oilfields.
The deal is the most significant venture agreed between a western oil
company and the authorities in the former Soviet Union and offers
encouragement to many other companies currently embroiled in negotiations.
The company said that after four years of negotiations it had signed a
protocol for the creation of a joint venture in the Tengiz area. The Tengiz
oilfield near the Caspian Sea is estimated to contain as much as 25bn
barrels of oil - equal to the size of Saudi Arabia's entire oil reserves.
Chevron said that when work began on the project, it would involve an
initial investment of Dollars 1.5bn by the venture partners over the first
three years. The company gave no timetable for the project.
Reports of the deal in the Russian press say that 80 per cent of the profits
from the venture would be allocated to Kazakhstan.
A previous deal over Tengiz which Chevron had tentatively agreed two years
ago came in for fierce criticism from the Russian press for selling natural
resources too cheaply. That deal was believed to involve a 28 per cent
profit margin for the US company.
Mr Kenneth Derr, Chevron's chairman, said: 'We are pleased that after long
discussion we've reached this breakthrough.' The company returned to the
negotiating table late last year once the break-up of the former USSR was
underway, transferring power over resource deals to the governments of the
republics.
Mr Derr said the agreement covers the Tengiz field, the Korolev field and an
exploration area extending over 4,000 square kilometres. The Tengiz field
contains oil at very high pressure with a high sulphur content. For this
reason, it will be expensive to exploit and demands sophisticated technology
not available in the former USSR.
Estimates for the amount of oil that can be recovered from the 25bn barrels
of reserves run at 3-4bn barrels. The deal is also believed to include the
construction of an oil pipeline to one of the Black Sea ports.
Mr Derr said in a recent interview: 'From our standpoint, it's a very high
risk deal, but the size of it is unique and it could have a meaningful
impact on a company of our size for a long time.'
The joint venture is expected to be in place for 40 years and is widely
regarded as a showcase deal. Mr Eduard Shevardnadze, former Soviet foreign
minister, said last year: 'It is no secret that the US will judge our
readiness to co-operate by the success or failure of this project.'
Wall Street took a positive view of the venture: 'It will have no major
impact on earnings for three to four years,' said Mr Paul Mlotok at Morgan
Stanley, 'but getting access to 25bn barrels of oil has got to be a big
plus.'
However, other industry observers sounded a note of caution, pointing out
that Chevron has only signed an initial protocol and the project could still
be subjected to long delays or even cancellation. The award of a feasibility
study for Russia's giant Sakhalin oil project is currently being reviewed.
Kazakhstan president, Mr Nursultan Nazarbayev, publicly welcomed Chevron's
involvement.

FT  09 MAY 92 / Deal on gas emission curbs imminent
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL LITTLEJOHNS and GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK, WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NEGOTIATORS from 143 countries appeared on the verge of agreement late last
night on an historic treaty to limit emissions of carbon dioxide and other
gases blamed for an alarming rise in the earth's temperature.
Mr Jean Ripert of France, chairman of the United Nations-sponsored
negotiating committee, hailed what he termed a 'decisive step', though the
document fell far short of the strict controls that negotiators originally
sought. Environmentalist groups complained that the treaty had been stripped
of any measures to make reductions in greenhouse gases binding on the
developed countries.
Mr Ripert was instrumental in narrowing differences between the US and EC
members, which, he acknowledged, were serious enough to have raised
questions over Washington even joining the treaty.
The convention will be a key document for adoption at the Earth Summit to be
held in Rio de Janeiro next month. Agreement on how to deal with global
warming would remove political obstacles to President George Bush's presence
at the 175-nation conference, which until now has been in doubt.
The draft convention would commit industrialised countries to aim to limit
emissions of greenhouse gases to 1990 levels. But, in deference to US
reservations, no deadline for this would be set.
US officials said the text represented 'a delicate balance of views'.
While the US has opposed the inclusion of binding targets or timetables for
reducing greenhouse gas emissions, its delegates see the current text as
committing it only to a frame of reference, rather than to implementing
specific targets or timetables.
The US is also pleased that the agreement now refers to reductions in all
greenhouse gases, rather than just carbon dioxide, the principal such gas.

<TEXT>
IT has taken him 202 years, but James Madison has at last put his final mark
on the US Constitution.
Michigan this week became the 38th state to ratify a constitutional
amendment to limit Congress's right to raise its own pay, first proposed by
Madison in 1789 - when Michigan was under British rule. This gives the
proposal the endorsement of three quarters of the states, enough to allow it
to take its place as the 27th amendment.
In spite of its advanced age, the amendment matches remarkably the mood of
US voters today, when Congress is under sustained attack for voting itself
perks and pay rises. The amendment provides that 'No law varying the
compensation for the services of senators and representatives shall take
effect, until an election of representatives shall have intervened.'
Madison, the principal author of the Bill of Rights, argued that allowing
members to vote themselves an immediate pay rise would show 'indecorum.'

FT  09 MAY 92 / Maverick champion of old-style Gaullist values: Seguin is
battling to prevent ratification of the Maastricht treaty
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN DAVIDSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN the votes were counted in the French National Assembly on Wednesday, Mr
Philippe Seguin, the maverick champion of old-style Gaullist values, was
jubilant. In the quixotic hope of throwing out the Maastricht Treaty of
European Union lock, stock and barrel, he had just delivered a mammoth
diatribe, lasting nearly 2  1/2 hours, designed to prove the whole exercise
was incompatible with the constitution and the soul of France.
He failed by a wide margin but chalked up a bigger score than anyone
expected. Of the 569 members voting, 101 cast their ballot against the
Maastricht Treaty, including nearly half the 126 members of his own Gaullist
Party.
The government was disturbed at such a large anti-Treaty vote but the
Gaullist party leadership, which had tried to tread an ambivalent line of
half-hearted scepticism, was appalled at the scale of the split in the
party.
Nobody seriously expects Mr Seguin can prevent ratification of the
Maastricht Treaty. With the Socialists, the Centrists, and the centre-right
UDF umbrella grouping, the government can still probably count on a solid
majority, even without the Gaullists.
Yet Mr Seguin's oratorical tour de force, set off powerful patriotic
vibrations with a large minority of his fellow parliamentarians, which may
yet create uncertainty in the ratification process.
He rallied support from nationalists across the political spectrum,
including 4 votes from the centre and centre-right, and all 26 Communists;
Mr Jean-Pierre Chevenement, the maverick Socialist and leader of a small
clan of 5 left-wing Gaullists in the Socialist Party, warmly congratulated
Mr Seguin for his very 'Republican' speech.
Philippe Seguin has long been a disturber of the peace in the Gaullist
Party. He served as social affairs minister in the government of Mr Jacques
Chirac in 1986-88; but after Mr Chirac's defeat in the 1988 presidential
elections, Mr Seguin challenged Mr Chirac's status as party leader.
A year later he joined a short-lived rebellion of young Gaullists in a
protest against the stranglehold of Chirac; but after it was put down
promptly recanted.
In relation to President Mitterrand's ambitions for a more integrated EC
however, Seguin's attitude has been one of consistent hostility.
Mr Seguin was born and brought up in Tunisia before its independence, and
some people link his passionate French patriotism to his pied-noir origins.
Whatever the psychological springs, Mr Seguin remains an unreconstructed
Gaullist, in an era when it is less fashionable and less feasible.
His European convictions derive in every detail from General de Gaulle's
passionate faith in France's future as an independent and sovereign country,
and his hostility to the supranational undertones of the European Community.
'Without a currency tomorrow, without a defence', said Mr Seguin on
Wednesday, 'without a diplomacy the day after, France would at best have as
little freedom of manoeuvre as Ukraine or Azerbaijan. Some people can accept
that; but it is not the future that I want for my country'.
'The logic of the economic and political process put together at Maastricht,
is that of a cut-price federalism, fundamentally anti-democratic, falsely
liberal, deliberately technocratic. The Europe they are offering us ..
buries the concept of national sovereignty and the great principles born of
the Revolution.
Like de Gaulle, Seguin's vision of Europe is of a loose congeries of freely
cooperating sovereign states, in what used to be summed up as 'L'Europe des
Patries'.
As a corollary, he believes in a wide extension of this Europe to include
all the countries of the continent.
De Gaulle remains a hero for many Frenchmen because he restored their
self-respect after the shame of Vichy, and appeared to promise France a
great future as a great power.
In 1958 many thought De Gaulle might reject the fledgeling EC. Instead he
announced: 'We shall enter the Common Market as agreed. We shall enter, but
upright'.
These were the words Philippe Seguin chose for his peroration. 'Yes, we want
Europe, but upright'. A romantic cry of protest for what he must have known
was likely to be a lost cause.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US Export-Import Bank said yesterday it would guarantee loans for two
Russian companies to import Dollars 90m of US oil production equipment and
planned to make total credits of up to Dollars 1bn available to Russia's oil
sector, Reuter reports from Moscow.
Mr Eugene Lawson, the US agency's vice-chairman, said Eximbank had agreed
with Russia's foreign trade bank to provide Dollars 90m for Texas-based
Lufkin Industries to supply two Russian enterprises.
'We can put serious money into this crucial area ..Anywhere from Dollars
500m to Dollars 1bn for starters,' he said.
The agency's board decided last month that Russia was worthy of short and
medium term credits and began doing business with it for the first time
since breaking ties with Moscow in 1974.
Mr Lawson said it had pinpointed the oil sector as an area where relatively
low investment could make a huge difference in boosting foreign currency
earnings.
'I'll be coming back in a month to see if we can sign an agreement that will
allow us to put immediate credit into Russia,' Mr Lawson said.
He said Russian oil output was crippled by lack of spare parts. The oil
industry had the potential to boost Russian export earnings.
In the longer term the agency, which provides guarantees for banks which
finance US export deals, aims to help upgrade Russia's neglected oil
pipelines, increase refining capacity and boost exploration.

FT  08 MAY 92 / ICI to close ephedrine plant in Australia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ICI AUSTRALIA, the subsidiary of Imperial Chemical Industries of the UK, is
closing a ADollars 38m (Pounds 16m) plant at Newcastle in New South Wales
only five months after it was fully commissioned.
The plant which produces ephedrine, an ingredient for cough and cold
remedies, made a pre-tax loss of ADollars 7m in the first half to 31 March,
according to the subsidiary. The factory, the only of its kind in Australia,
was built in the late 1980s to export to the Far East. However, competition
from Japan and China has led to persistent losses.
Mr Philip Weickhardt, general manager of the subsidiary's speciality
chemicals operations, said the plant would be mothballed.
'It is unlikely we will be re-opening it for ephedrine production, as we do
not see it as commercially viable,' he said. He added the company had a
number of options for the fine chemicals plant including selling it. About
50 employees will be affected by the factory's closure.
Restructuring of the European fibres industry continued as Akzo, Dutch
chemicals group, announced reorganisation of its carpet fibres operations.
The company is meeting unions with the intent to cut as many as 250 jobs
beyond the 60 already agreed. The company said its carpet fibres business
had been troubled for some time because falling demand had led to excess
capacity and falling prices. Akzo said it is looking for a long-term partner
to secure the future of the business.

TWENTY-THREE Tamil guerrillas and 11 soldiers were killed in fierce fighting
in eastern Sri Lanka yesterday, police said, Reuter reports from Colombo.
They said 16 rebels and eight soldiers were killed when troops stormed a
coastal base of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam in Batticaloa district.
Nine soldiers were wounded and four rebels were captured, police said.
Three soldiers and seven rebels died earlier yesterday when guerrillas
ambushed a government patrol on a road in neighbouring Polonnaruwa district.
Police said there were two other battles in the jungles of Polonnaruwa
between troops and rebels, but no details were available. Polonnaruwa was
the scene last week of a series of massacres in which 130 people died.
Tamil rebels attacked a Moslem village, killing 56 people. Moslem villagers
in retaliation killed 74 Tamils in two neighbouring villages. A government
spokesman said yesterday that a committee comprising a retired judge, a
senior army officer and a senior policeman was investigating the killings.

FT  08 MAY 92 / UN envoy takes message to Col Gadaffi
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK NICHOLSON, Middle East Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SENIOR United Nations envoy yesterday left for Libya bearing a letter for
Colonel Muammer Gadaffi, the Libyan leader, in what appeared a further
mission to emphasise that Tripoli must comply with UN resolutions demanding
the extradition of two suspects in the Lockerbie bombing.
No details on the purpose of the visit were made available yesterday. But
diplomats in New York stressed that the trip was not prompted by any
movement in the deadlock between Libya and the UN. The visit appears
designed rather to keep channels of communication open between the UN and
Tripoli.
Mr Vladimir Petrovsky, UN undersecretary-general, is expected to arrive in
Tripoli at the weekend. He visited Tripoli earlier this year to call on Col
Gadaffi to hand over the suspects and is expected to repeat the demand in a
meeting with the Libyan leader.
As the secretary-general's representative, Mr Petrovsky has no brief to
negotiate with Col Gadaffi, but rather will reiterate the terms of UN
resolution 731, which calls on Libya to hand over the Lockerbie suspects and
four men accused by France of being behind the bombing of a UTA airliner and
for Tripoli concretely to dissociate itself from acts of terrorism. 'This is
not mediation, just communication,' said a western diplomat at the UN.
Mr Petrovsky will tell the Libyan government that air, arms and diplomatic
sanctions placed on April 15 will remain in force until Libya complies with
resolution 731. Countries applying the sanctions, under UN resolution 748,
are expected to give a progress report on their compliance to the UN
Security Council on May 15.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US has uncovered 'strong indications' that Iranian diplomats helped to
plan the March 17 bombing of the Israeli embassy in Buenos Aires in which 29
people died and 225 were wounded, a senior state department official said
yesterday, Reuter reports from Washington.
The official, who spoke to Reuters on condition of anonymity, said Iranian
embassies all over Latin America and elsewhere were collecting information
on other possible targets for attack.
They were concentrating on Israeli, Jewish and American targets.
But he said the US did not have conclusive proof of Iranian culpability.
The US official said: 'There are some indications that Iranian embassies in
Latin America have been collecting information which might be important
substantive background to planning such an attack.'
The Buenos Aires bombing was widely seen as revenge for Israel's killing in
February of Sheikh Abbas Musawi, a prominent Hizbollah leader in Lebanon.

<TEXT>
FINLAND'S economy has begun to pull out of its worst slump since the early
1920s, but full recovery is still some way off, according to an economic
analysis released yesterday by the country's ministry of finance.
The latest signs of optimism are a substantial improvement in Finland's
exports which rose by 13 per cent in value and 11 per cent in volume during
the first quarter.
The trade balance for the January-March period reached FM2bn(Pounds 251m),
helped by last November's 12.3 per cent devaluation of the Markka.
Finland's industrial production has also begun to rise after a 6 per cent
drop last year.
A 7 per cent growth rate is expected in the forestry sector in 1992 and
around 2 per cent in engineering with an improvement in profitability due to
better price competitiveness.
However, other economic indicators are less optimistic. This year's overall
growth rate is set to fall by a further 1 per cent after a 6.0 per cent drop
in 1991.
The government's own deficit this year is predicted to rise to FIM54bn and
registered unemployment looks set to average 11 per cent, while household
consumption has fallen by an annual rate of 4 per cent over the early months
of the year.
Earnings rises will be only from 2 to 2.5 per cent in 1992 with an annual
inflation rate of only 3 per cent.

FT  08 MAY 92 / Kmart buys Czech department store
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
KMART, one of the largest and best-known US retailers, yesterday announced
that it was acquiring a majority interest in MAJ, one of the biggest
department stores in the centre of Prague.
It also said that it was negotiating with government authorities for the
purchase of a further 11 stores in both the Czech and Slovak republics.
These deals have been agreed in principle, but are subject to final review
and approval.
This is first time a foreign company has acquired retail outlets in
Czechoslovakia, and the deal takes Kmart into Europe for the first time. In
the US, its operations range from speciality chains, like the Waldenbooks
bookstores, to more than 2,300 discount stores selling general merchandise.
The US retailer - which was built up by a notoriously stingy businessman,
Sebastian Kresge, in the early 1900s - said that its total outlay could
amount to Dollars 100m if all 12 stores are acquired.
This sum would be spread over three years and would include some expenditure
on improving the stores. Kmart has paid Dollars 11.8m for the MAJ interest,
and will invest another Dollars 3.5m in this store alone over the next three
years.
Kmart has been negotiating with the Czech State Asset Fund for at least a
year, and is belived to have been interested initially in the rival Kotva
store in Prague. This is the country's largest department store, and has
been introducing West European goods and displays.
The MAJ store, although ideally located, has a more downmarket image, and
sells a very wide variety of goods - from clothing to housewares. Kmart said
that MAJ's space totalled about 200,000 square feet, significantly more than
any of its Kmart stores in the US.
The company says it plans to introduce US retail expertise to Czecoslovakia,
and will send some of its personnel to Europe.

FT  08 MAY 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TRADERS IN stock index futures spoke of a lacklustre session with dealers
undecided about the direction of the market, although the general mood
remained positive, writes Joel Kibazo.
The June contract experienced a squeeze early in the session which sent it
up 8 to 2,750 by 10am. This proved to be the day's high. Caution set in and
June retreated as independent traders went 'long', and it reached 2,730 by
early afternoon.
Reports from Paris of an indirect cut in French interest rates were taken as
positive in London, and not only halted the downward trend of June but led
to renewed buying interest.
June closed at 2,739, a premium of 37 to cash and around 19 points above its
estimated fair value premium of about 18. Turnover was 7,270 lots.
The traded options market was particularly busy, and the day's turnover rose
to 52,978 contracts. The volume in the FT-SE option was also high, at 17,042
lots.
Also active were the individual stock options. Amstrad led the way,
recording a total of 3,773 trades, with the June 90 puts the busiest series.
This was followed by BP, which released disappointing figures and saw 3,014
lots traded.

FT  08 MAY 92 / London Stock Exchange: Market dips after hitting new record
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LONDON'S equity market extended its record-breaking run, punching its way
through the 2,700 barrier and reaching another all-time high, before turning
back sharply amid hints that the first of an expected rash of big rights
issues is imminent.
After a volatile session, the FT-SE 100-share Index settled 3.2 higher at
2,701.9. There was further encouragement with yesterday's turnover figures:
swollen by yet another big share placing, the number of shares traded
reached 784.3m, way above the depressed levels of last year and continuing
the run of heavy post-general election activity.
Since the election there have been only two trading sessions where the value
of customer business transacted in the marketplace has fallen below the
Pounds 1bn mark. One of those was just after the Easter bank holiday.
There was further stimulation for the market from the latest economic data,
which showed domestic car sales during April 9.1 per cent up on last year  -
the first increase since October 1989  - while a number of UK building
societies reduced their mortgage rates. Another boost to the market's
confidence came from sterling's latest good showing. The UK currency, helped
by a reduction in French interest rates and no shift in German interest
rates, extended its recent strong performance, closing sharply higher
against the dollar and D-Mark.
The wave of overseas buying that drove the Footsie to the brink of 2,700 on
Wednesday was evident again first thing yesterday, with the big US
investment banks said to have been particularly aggressive.
With the Footsie future continuing to hold up well, the cash market built
confidently on a firm opening and gradually worked up from an opening gain
of 4.6 to reach another all-time high of 2,714.1 ahead of Wall Street's
opening. A slightly disappointing performance by the US market, which
initially edged higher but quickly ran into a flurry of profit-taking,
triggered similar selling in London.
The selling, although never heavy, was sufficient to push the Footsie into
negative territory, albeit briefly. It was around this time that the rights
issue stories began to circulate. British Airways was one big name mentioned
as a potential fund-raiser.
First-quarter figures from BP, the oil giant, were also said to have been
partly responsible for denting the market's confidence. Enthusiasm for BP
shares, after the maintained dividend, was quickly eroded.
Sears, the retailer, was another poor performer, with a veiled warning about
the dividend upsetting the market and prompting a sharp decline in the
shares. On the upside, BET climbed after a broker buy recommendation. The
Scottish power generators, which have badly underperformed the utilities
sectors and the market since their flotation last year, raced higher as
marketmakers were caught short of stock.
The current fashion for big share placings continued yesterday, with agency
broker James Capel said to have placed 41m shares in Queens Moat Houses, the
hotels group. Prudential Group was said to have been the seller.

FT  08 MAY 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow declines ahead of
employment data
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
A LETHARGIC day on Wall Street saw US equities edge lower in quiet trading
ahead of today's release of employment figures for April, writes Karen Zagor
in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 6.04 to 3,363.37 amid slim New
York SE volume of 169m shares. Losing issues narrowly led those advancing by
822 to 812. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 eased 0.93 to 415.86 and the Nasdaq
composite of over-the-counter stocks slipped 2.20 to 587.16.
The market shrugged off the release of jobless claims for the week ended
April 25, which rose 11,000 to 415,000, and turned its attention to today's
unveiling of employment data for April. The Federal Reserve's monetary
policy decisions are often based partly on the employment numbers, and there
has been widespread speculation that the Fed may ease if the numbers are
weaker than expected.
After two days of solid advances, the transportation sector lost ground,
with the Dow Jones Transportation Average finishing off 12.71 at 1,394.99.
AMR, parent of American Airlines, dipped Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 68 5/8 ,
UAL, parent of United Airlines, relinquished Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 125
and USAir edged down Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 14 5/8 .
The release of same-store sales for April by a number of big US retailers
spurred active trading in the sector. Sears was one of the most heavily
traded board issues, falling Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 42 on the back of a
2.1 per cent dip in comparable domestic store sales for the four weeks to
May 2.
Trading was also heavy in Gap Inc, which climbed Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 42
1/4 after reporting a 13 per cent improvement in comparable store sales for
April.
Federal Express dropped Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 40 3/4 . The company is
cutting prices for large-volume customers in a move aimed at improving its
competitiveness.
In over-the-counter trading, FHP International added Dollars  7/8 at Dollars
15 1/4 after the health maintenance organisation services company posted
third-quarter earnings of 45 cents a share, against 36 cents a year ago.
Ben &amp; Jerry 'A' shares jumped Dollars 3 1/4 to Dollars 41 1/4 after the ice
cream maker announced first-quarter net earnings of 40 cents a share,
compared with 19 cents a year earlier.
Canada
GAINS IN oil and gas shares countered losses in communication issues,
keeping the broad market in Toronto looking unchanged on the day.
The composite index was up just 1.6 at the finish at 3,362.9, while falls
exceeded rises by 273 to 249. Light trading volume of 21.7m shares was well
below Wednesday's 30.5m.
GW Utilities and Gulf Canada Resources said they will jointly try to sell
their controlling interest in Home Oil. The two had been attempting to sell
their interests in Home separately. GW held at CDollars 7 1/4 , Gulf Canada
lost CDollars  1/4 to CDollars 8 1/8 and Home Oil was CDollars  1/4 firmer
at CDollars 16 3/8 .
Magna International 'A' climbed CDollars 2 1/4 to CDollars 32 7/8 , after
gaining CDollars  3/4 the previous day. Market sources said the rise is due
to a recommendation by a Wertheim Schroder analyst.

FT  08 MAY 92 / Money Markets: Interest rates softer
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
INTEREST rates in the sterling money markets softened yesterday as the
pound's performance improved on the foreign exchanges.
Sterling's rise to DM2.9400 in the same week that the Bank of England had
signalled a base rate cut of  1/2 percentage point renewed traders'
confidence in the possibility that rates may be shaved again in the
not-too-distant future.
At the same time, the German Bundesbank's decision not to raise its Lombard
rate for emergency funding at its central council meeting yesterday removed
lingering fears that Tuesday's cut in sterling base rate would be
short-lived.
The trade in sterling futures registered greater confidence over the outlook
for rates. The June short sterling contract ended at 89.96, just below its
high for the day, after a previous close of 89.93. That new level implies
that the market believes interest rates in June will be around 10.04 per
cent.
In the interbank market, interest rates edged slightly lower. The rate for
3-month money, seen as an important indicator of future movements, was at 10
1/8 - 1/16 per cent, down from Wednesday's 10 3/16 .
In the discount market, trading was, in the words of one analyst, 'typically
Thursdayish', as traders held back paper in the hope of getting better rates
on Friday, before the weekend. Discount bankers refrained from selling bills
in the morning, even though the Bank of England forecast a large shortage of
around Pounds 1.4bn.
The Bank purchased Pounds 12m of Band-1 bank bills at 9 7/8 per cent, Pounds
8m of Band-3 bills at 9- 21/32 per cent, and Pounds 13m of Band-4 bills at 9
5/8 - 19/32 per cent. Later, it purchased bills totalling Pounds 1.8bn, made
up of Pounds 3m of Band-3 treasury bills at 9 21/32 per cent, Pounds 136m of
Band-3 bank bills at 9 21/32 per cent, Pounds 3m of Band-4 Treasury bills at
9 19/32 per cent, and Pounds 38m of Band-4 bank bills at 9 19/32 per cent.
In the afternoon, the Bank purchased Pounds 119m of Band-1 Treasury bills at
9 7/8 per cent, Pounds 434m of Band-1 bank bills at 9 7/8 per cent, Pounds
337m of Band-2 bank bills at 9 7/8 per cent, Pounds 37m of Band-3 bank bills
at 9 21/32 per cent, and Pounds 25m of Band-4 bank bills at 9 19/32 per
cent. The Bank provided late assistance of around Pounds 285m.
As a result of slack trading in the morning, the overnight rate touched 10
3/4 - 1/2 per cent at one stage, and ended at 9 3/4 - 5/8 per cent.

FT  08 MAY 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Pound and franc perform well
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A GOOD performance by both sterling and the French franc on foreign
exchanges yesterday tested the received wisdom that EMS-member countries
need to keep their interest rates significantly above Germany's, writes
James Blitz.
Only two days after the Bank of England engineered a  1/2 percentage point
cut in UK base rates, the pound continued to perform well against both the
D-Mark and the dollar, with several analysts suggesting that it has not yet
fully tested its upside. Sterling ended in London at DM2.9400, up 1 1/2
pfennigs. Against the dollar, it crossed the Dollars 1.80 point in the early
afternoon for the first time since February, before receding to Dollars
1.7965, after a previous close of Dollars 1.7945. In New York it ended
easier at Dollars 1.7945.
At the same time, the French franc suffered only a slight loss in the
markets, in spite of a decision by the Banque de France to signal a
half-point reduction in base rates. The central bank had lowered the reserve
requirement on banks' sight deposits to 1 per cent from 4.1 per cent with
effect from May 16. The D-Mark was finally around FFr3.3669 in London, after
ending on Wednesday at FFr3.3662.
Both currencies will have immediately gained from the German Bundesbank's
decision not to raise its emergency Lombard rate yesterday, as some traders
had feared. But analysts also feel that the market is being increasingly
guided by factors other than the level of interest rates.
Mr Mark Austin, chief economist at Hongkong and Shanghai Banking in London,
said yesterday: 'There has been a lot of discussion in Eur-ope about the
need for EMS-member countries to keep interest rates above Germany's. That
wisdom is now taking a blow after the per-formance of sterling and the
French franc.'
The Bundesbank's rate decision also gave the US currency its first positive
day of the week, with the dollar finishing better at DM1.6360, compared with
a previous close of DM1.6305. It ended higher in New York at DM1.6373.
According to some traders, the market had been short of dollars before the
Bundesbank council meeting, and had to cover itself afterwards. The
nervousness about the D-Mark was also compounded by news that German public
sector employers had increased their pay offer to striking workers in a bid
to end the 11-day-old strike, potentially raising new difficulties over
fiscal policy.
However, disappointment remained that the dollar had not staged a more
impressive rally. It firmed only slightly to Y132.70 from a previous close
of Y132.40, and finished in New York at Y132.75.
The market's eyes will be fixed on today's US monthly employment report,
which analysts see as the first indicator for a week to give signs of the
long-awaited US recovery.

FT  08 MAY 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Saving energy with born-again
beverage cans - Geoffrey Dyer reports on the growth of the aluminium
recycling sector in the US
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEOFFREY DYER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SOPHISTICATED collection system has allowed aluminium beverage can
recycling in the US to set a new record of nearly 57bn cans in 1991, up 3
per cent from the 1990 record of 55bn.
The can recycling figures contribute to the growth of the American aluminium
secondary industry, which over the past decade has accounted for about 30
per cent of total US aluminium supply.
'Of all the metals that are recycled today aluminium continues to be the
model,' according to Mr Richard Holder, chairman of the Washington based
Aluminium Association.
The recycling rate for aluminium cans in 1991 was 62.4 per cent and reflects
the increasing efficiency of the system through which producers pay
customers for returning cans.
Because of the relatively high scrap value of aluminium smelters have a
strong incentive to recycle and to pay for the recovery, transportation and
processing of the cans. A system has been set up with 10,000 collection
points and including everyone from private businesses to boy scouts.
The Aluminium Association claims the system to be so efficient that a can
may be purchased, used, recycled and returned to the shelf in as little as
six weeks.
Technological developments have allowed for more efficient production and
the weight of an aluminium beverage can is 30 per cent less than it was 20
years ago.
Last year's recycling rate did fall from the 1990 rate of 63.6 per cent, but
Mr Holder believes that some recyclers may have held over cans in the hope
that the recession would end this year and that the aluminium prices would
rise. He believes that in the long-term a recycling rate of close to 100 per
cent is still a 'reasonable target'.
Aluminium is an ideal metal for recycling, not just because of its high
scrap value, but because it is relatively easy to recycle and can be used
again and again.
The benefits from recycling are both economic and environmental. Aluminium
is one of the most energy-intensive materials in common use, the main
requirement being the electricity needed to smelt aluminium from alumina
(the intermediate material produced from bauxite ore). Recycling requires
only 5 per cent of the energy that is needed to produce aluminium from
bauxite.
One study has estimated that doubling worldwide aluminium recovery rates
would eliminate over 1m tonnes of air pollutants, including toxic fluoride.
The savings on raw materials are considerable. For every tonne of resmelted
aluminium, four tonnes of bauxite and 700 kg of petroleum coke and pitch are
saved. Recycling also reduces the requirements of landfill space.
Recyclers have gone to considerable lengths to make themselves more
efficient in recent years. The scrap collection networks have been expanded,
although they do not rival the schemes for beverage cans.
Improvements in processing and engineering techniques, making the plants
less labour-intensive, a reduction in fuel consumption and more
sophisticated methods of avoiding impurities have all helped to reduce
costs.
Ironically, the producers of such environmentally-sound materials have found
it difficult to cut costs because of the burden of environmental legislation
upon them. Regulation in the 1990s has become 'much more cumbersome and
burdensome", according to Mr Howard Sinclair, Vice President of Wabash
Alloys in Wabash, Indiana.
The 1990 Clean Air Act has created the most impact and producers have had to
concentrate their minds on ways to reduce waste and pollution at every stage
of the process.
The enforcement, as much as the nature of the regulations, has become
stricter. 'While our customers want us to lower costs and increase
efficiency, the government seems to want us to increase costs,' laments Mr
Sinclair.
Aluminium recovered from scrap is an increasingly important part of the US
aluminium supply and the 1990 figure for secondary recovery of 2.4m tonnes
was an increase of 16.5 per cent from 1989.
As well as cans the American aluminium industry recycles many consumer
products including used motor parts, garden chairs and pots and pans.
Scrap that is produced by manufacturers during processing, like clippings,
cuttings and turnings, is immediately diverted to the aluminium recycling
stream and 'in-house' scrap which is generated by foundries is remelted and
recycled on the premises.
The scrap is crushed and melted ina furnace, where other metals are added to
the aluminium to alloy it. The melted aluminium is usually solidified as an
ingot and sold as a number of products such as foil, wire or sheet.
Some secondary producers recycle aluminium scrap into forms which are used
as deoxidisers by the steel industry and into other products which are used
by the chemical, coating, powder and paste industries.

FT  08 MAY 92 / Government Bonds: Strike settlement hopes underpin German
rally
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON and KAREN ZAGOR
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GERMAN government bonds moved higher yesterday, encouraged for the second
successive day by hopes of a settlement in the dispute between employers and
striking public sector workers.
The bund futures contract on Liffe, the London exchange, closed at 87.39, up
from an opening level of 87.14, and only just below the high point of the
day of 87.44. Volume was heavy at 95,000 contracts.
Talks between public sector workers and employers broke up with the unions
considering an improved pay offer, believed to be worth around 5.6 per cent.
The government had offered 4.8 per cent, against the union's claim of 9.5
per cent.
However, even if the public sector pay dispute is settled, industrial action
in other areas of the economy looks likely. IG Metall, the powerful
industrial union, said 65,000 of its members joined a three-hour stoppage
yesterday in pursuit of higher pay.
FRENCH government bonds pushed strongly higher, as the government moved to
ease credit conditions by cutting bank reserve requirements.
In the morning session, prices were weaker as investors took profits
following a strong  1/2 -point rally on Wednesday. The Bank of France
disappointed some dealers by keeping intervention rates unchanged at 9.6 per
cent in regular money market operations. The authorities also drained
FFr4.5bn from the money market.
However, the announcement that bank reserve deposits with the central bank
had been cut allowed commercial banks to reduce base lending rates by around
a  1/2 point, to 9.85 per cent.
The benchmark 8 1/2 per cent OAT maturing 2002 rose strongly on the news,
closing on a yield of 8.62 per cent, from 8.68 per cent at the opening. The
yield spread between the French and German markets at the 10-year maturity
closed from 70 basis points to 68 basis points.
THE UK government bond market traded within a narrow range, following trends
in continental European markets in the absence of new domestic factors.
The 9 per cent gilt maturing 2011 closed up just  1/32 of a point on the day
at 99 23/32 , for a yield of 9.02 per cent.
On Liffe, trading volume in the June gilt futures contract was extremely
light at 5,000 contracts. The June future opened at 98.20 and traded down to
98.11 during the morning, before recovering in the afternoon to close at
98.22.
One factor helping to support prices was the strength of sterling on the
foreign exchange markets. The UK currency rose from DM2.925 at the close on
Wednesday to around DM2.94 by late afternoon yesterday.
However, analysts said there was uncertainty over the future direction of UK
interest rates. The outcome of the current round of German pay negotiations
and the monetary policy set by the Bundesbank would determine whether UK
rates can come down again.
The Bank of England said it sold all of the Pounds 800m tap issue of 8 3/4
per cent gilts maturing 1997 announced on Friday.
US TREASURY prices drifted lower in a second consecutive session dominated
by afternoon Treasury auctions.
In late trading, the Treasury's bellwether 30-year bond was  3/8 lower at 99
31/32 , yielding 7.997 per cent.
There was some profit-taking after the afternoon sale of Dollars 10bn of
30-year bonds in the last leg of the Treasury's Dollars 36bn refunding
auction. There was strong bidding for the long bonds, which had an average
yield of 8 per cent and a bid-to-cover ratio of 2.48 to 1. On Wednesday,
bond prices moved higher after a successful auction of Dollars 11bn of
10-year notes.
The Federal Reserve did not intervene in the open market. Fed Funds were
quoted at 3 per cent during the Fed's usual intervention period.
As well as this week's refunding auctions, the market is concerned with
today's release of employment data for April. There was little reaction to
the release of jobless claims for the week ended April 30.
JAPANESE government bond prices rose, encouraged by a 532-point rise in the
Nikkei index and favourable terms on the latest auction of 10-year
government paper.
The benchmark 10-year government bond issue No 129 closed the Tokyo day on a
yield of 5.6 per cent, from 5.635 per cent on Wednesday.
Traders were relieved that the latest Y800bn issue of government paper
carries a 5.7 per cent coupon, in line with current market yields. Last week

FT  08 MAY 92 / International Company News: RAS rises sharply after special
item

<TEXT>
RIUNIONE Adriatica di Sicurta (RAS), the Italian insurance company
controlled by Germany's Allianz, raised net 1991 profits by almost a half to
L201.5bn (Dollars 163m) from L137.9bn in 1990.
Much of the gain was fuelled by extraordinary items linked to the sale of
equity stakes in Austria and Germany and property transactions in Italy. As
a result, the dividend will remain unchanged at L300 for ordinary shares and
L360 for savings stock.
The company announced a complex rights issue to raise more than L800bn for
future investment. RAS will increase its nominal capital by L54bn to L271bn
via a one-for-four issue of new ordinary and savings shares, priced at
L11,000 and L7,300 respectively.
Shareholders will be offered one warrant, convertible exclusively into
savings shares, for every four shares of either category held.
The warrants will be exercisable into new savings shares, priced at L11,000,
on the basis of one new share for every two warrants. The warrants will be
valid from the beginning of next year until the end of 1995.
The issue was initially poorly received on the Milan stock market, where RAS
shares were suspended yesterday. The bourse has been hit by a string of cash
calls at a time of particularly poor sentiment towards Italian equities.
Reactions improved after Allianz confirmed that it would take up its full
quota, which would effectively halve the size of the call on the market.
Premium income at RAS went up by 14.2 per cent to L3,247bn for the parent
company and by 10 per cent to L6,439bn at group level.
The company said non-life business continued to suffer in Italy, with an
underwriting loss of L101bn on motor insurance last year.
Domestically, RAS registered strong gains in premiums, with non-life income
rising by 13 per cent to L2,045bn while life insurance rose by 20 per cent
to L715bn.

FT  08 MAY 92 / International Company News: Saga Petroleum setback blamed on
marked fall in crude oil price
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
SAGA Petroleum, the independent oil company, yesterday disclosed a fall in
first-quarter pre-tax profits to NKr187m (Dollars 29m) from NKr339m last
year due to a marked fall in crude oil prices.
However, group operating revenue rose to NKr1.26bn from NKr1.09bn, helped by
higher petroleum production which rose to the equivalent of about 1m tonnes
of oil.
Operating profit fell to NKr280m from NKr393m. The reduction in operating
profit was due largely to lower oil prices compared with the first quarter
of 1991, which was affected by the Gulf war.
There were increased costs relating to expansion in exploration activities
and higher field depreciation. A royalty in the Oseberg (oil field) was also
reflected in increased costs, the company said.
Saga did not detail exploration costs but said that depreciation had risen
by NKr81m to NKr279m. Group operating expenses rose to NKr977m from NKr694m.
First-quarter crude oil sales were lifted to 6.4m barrels from 5.1m barrels
in the same period last year.
Saga said that it obtained an average sale price of NKr114 per barrel of oil
in the first three months compared with NKr136 last year.
To improve the company's financial structure, Saga said it issued a NKr1bn
bond with a 10-year maturity in Norway in January.
Exportfinans, the export credit guarantee bank owned by the commercial
banks, reported a 19 per cent improvement in first-quarter operating profit
to NKr87m from NKr73m last year.
Exportfinans explained the increase was due to improvements in asset
management and non-recurring income from certain financial transactions. The
company said that as a result of balance sheet growth, its capital adequacy
ratio declined from 21 per cent at year end to 16.7 per cent at end-March.
Loans disbursed in the first quarter were 15 per cent up on last year and
totalled NKr598m. Of that, about 65 per cent was extended on market terms
while 35 per cent was government-supported credits.
The grant element of mixed credits in 1992 was increased by NKr250m to
NKr340m. This, and the adjustment of regulations governing maturities and
the proportions that could be financed, provided the industry with a greater
opportunity for contracts, the company said.
It said there was increasing interest in export credits on market terms for
exports to industrialised countries.

<TEXT>
MATUSCHKA, the Munich-based financial services outfit run by Count
Matuschka, continued its slimming-down exercise yesterday with the sale of
its Frankfurt-based currency managing unit.
The sale, to the business's managers and to Oechsle International Advisers,
a Boston-based international fund management group, follows a series of
disposals during the course of the past year.
In June last year, Mr Manfred Meier-Preschany, a Frankfurt-based corporate
doctor, was brought in to deal with the after-effects of over-expansion in
the late-1980s.
He recommended that the group pull out of currency trading, venture capital,
property consultancy and other peripheral activities.
Mr Meier-Preschany left at the beginning of the year and Count Matuschka
re-assumed the job of chief executive. He has continued the rationalisation
process. In recent months he has sold Matuschka-Capital, Matuschka &amp; Co,
Zurich, and its stake in Techno Venture Management  - all venture capital
operations.
The Count bought out his partners, took his personal stake in the group up
to 66 per cent and restructured the core businesses in a complex transaction
involving EffectInvest, an Austrian private bank.
Matuschka was once spoken of as one of Germany's leading independent
financial services businesses and at its high-point employed more than 468
people. This is down to less than 100 people, although the irrepressible
Count boasts of the group's strong balance sheet and has plans to expand the
core businesses.

JAPANESE manufacturers such as Nissan, the automotive maker, Kobe Steel and
Kawasaki Steel, are increasing fund procurement through US securitisation
agencies.
With the current stock market slump preventing fund-raising through equity,
companies are keen to pursue alternative measures. They are also under
increasing pressure to collect receivable credits, as the slowing economy is
affecting cash flow.
Securitisation of sales credits is restrained in the domestic financial
markets, as securitisation agencies are not permitted. The Securities and
Exchange Act, the Japanese version of the US Glass Steagall Act, also
defines repackaged assets as certificates, preventing the instruments from
being traded as securities.

FT  08 MAY 92 / International Company News: American HDTV rivals agree to
share royalties
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
AMERICAN groups offering competing technologies to establish a US standard
for high definition television (HDTV) have agreed in principal to share
royalties from the licensing of their technologies if one of them wins
approval from the Federal Communications Commission.
The FCC is currently testing four all-digital HDTV systems. Two are offered
by General Instruments, in collaboration with the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology. A third has been proposed by AT&amp;T working with Zenith
Electronics.
In a move to 'share risks and rewards,' the American joint ventures have
agreed that if one of their three systems is adopted they will share
royalties. In addition, the two groups have agreed to work together to
enhance the system selected as a standard by the FCC if necessary. This
might be appropriate, for example, if the FCC testers find a combination of
some aspects of two different systems preferable.
For the time being, however, the two groups will continue to seek adoption
of their respective HDTV systems. The FCC testing is expected to be
completed later this year, with an FCC advisory committee scheduled to make
its recommendation early in 1993 and its final selection in mid-1993.
Mr Richard Wiley, chairman of the FCC advisory committee on advanced
television responsible for conducting the HDTV tests, said that the
agreement is a 'positive development that will help us to achieve our
ultimate goal of the best possible standard'. However, he said that the
agreement will not affect the committee's decision or disadvantage other
entrants.
Also competing in the standard setting tests is an international consortium
led by Philips of the Netherlands and Thomson of France, together with NBC,
a unit of General Electric and the David Sarnoff Research Center in the US.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
DIFFICULT trading conditions contributed to a sharp fall in earnings at OK
Bazaars and Afcol, two retail-based subsidiaries of the South African
Breweries group, in the year to end-March.
Attributable earnings dropped 37 per cent at OK Bazaars, the mass
merchandising supermarket chain, and by 35 per cent at Afcol, the furniture
group. OK Bazaars decided to pass its final dividend, while the overall
dividend at Afcol dropped to 53 cents per share from 81.5 cents.
OK Bazaars said the group had been particularly hard hit by escalating
unemployment and the introduction of VAT.
Turnover was only 5 per cent up at R5.04bn (Dollars 1.8bn). Operating income
was down 27 per cent to R43.3m. High interest rates and higher borrowings
saw the interest bill of R46.8m exceed operating profit. However, a R13.5m
tax credit allowed the group to make a R9.3m attributable profit, down 37
per cent on 1991.
The higher borrowings meant gearing ratio jumped to 111 per cent from 71 per
cent. Management said 'strenuous action' had been taken to restore this to
more appropriate levels. The group closed 23 stores during the year.
Afcol's profits were hurt by a severely depressed furniture market. Output
in the furniture manufacturing industry fell 17.4 per cent in real terms
during 1991  - the worst decline in a decade. The group managed, however, to
increase market share.

TEXAS Instruments announced a fast new microprocessor to be used in a new

later this month.
The Supersparc chip will give Sun workstations a much needed performance
boost. The workstation market leader has been facing increased competition
from Hewlett-Packard and International Business Machines workstations that
outpace Sun's current products.
The Texas Instruments chip, the first of a series of microprocessors that
are being jointly developed with Sun Microsystems, will also be used in new
mid-range computers planned by ICL of the UK. Texas Instruments will also
offer the chip to other computer manufacturers.
With its announcement yesterday, Texas Instruments has beaten rival Cypress
Semiconductor to the punch. Next week Cypress and Sun Microsystems are
expected to announce an even faster version of the Sparc microprocessor,
although volume manufacturing of the Cypress chip is believed to be several
months away.

</HEADLINE>

   HANOVER
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
IVECO, Fiat of Italy's commercial vehicles arm and Europe's second largest
truck maker, expects another loss this year, for the second year in
succession.
This follows a so-far undisclosed loss for 1991 which 'will be a lot smaller
than many expect,' according to Dr Giancarlo Boschetti, chief executive.
Dr Boschetti declined to elaborate on the potential size of the losses. The
net profit of Dutch-headquartered Iveco had already slumped to Fl 23m
(Dollars 12.7m) in 1990 from Fl 590.9m a year earlier.
However, Dr Boschetti said Iveco, which built 124,000 vehicles last year and
claims just over one fifth of Europe's total truck market, could have made
an operating profit in 1991 but for continuing losses at its Spanish
acquisition, Enasa.
Iveco acquired a majority stake in Enasa, which also includes UK-based heavy
truck maker Seddon Atkinson, early last year and has committed nearly Pounds
250m (Dollars 425m) to its restructuring.
Speaking before Iveco's new heavy truck range, the Eurotech, makes its debut
at the Hanover commercial vehicle exhibition today, Dr Boschetti said Iveco
had fully expected it would take three years 'to turn Enasa round'.
As part of the recovery programme for Enasa, its Valladolid plant near
Madrid is being used as one of two production bases for the Eurotech range,
the other being Ulm in Germany.
However, Iveco has also suffered financially from adverse conditions in
several markets, notably the UK.
Iveco Ford Truck, which Iveco owns jointly with Ford of the US, and over
which Iveco has management control, itself made a net loss of Pounds 38.6m
last year, as a result of the UK truck market falling into its steepest
decline since the Second World War, with sales last year falling to their
lowest level since 1954.
Iveco has lost 7,000 jobs in pursuit of higher productivity over the past
several years, and plans no let-up in seeking further productivity gains.
However, Dr Boschetti said that Iveco expected to achieve this without
resorting to significant redundancies.
Dr Boschetti said that it was highly unlikely that Iveco would seek further
acquisitions after Enasa, had been fully absorbed.
The Eurotech trucks range marks one of the final stages of a L5,000bn
(Dollars 4bn) investment by Iveco over the past five years, effectively to
renew its product range and update manufacturing facilities.

closer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Equitable Life Assurance Society, the fourth largest insurance company
in the US, moved a step closer to successful demutualisation yesterday when
policyholders approved the transaction.
Demutualisation is the process whereby a mutual insurer, essentially
controlled by policyholders, turns itself into a 'conventional'
shareholder-owned company. Equitable is the largest US insurer to have taken
this route, but  - given that the need to raise new capital is fairly
widespread in the insurance sector  - others may follow suit.
Equitable's policyholders were asked to vote on the matter on Wednesday.
Some 888,338 policyholders returned ballot cards  - out of a maximum of 2.2m
 - of which 819,964 were in favour. This 92.3 per cent vote in favour easily
surpasses the minimum two-thirds majority needed.
Equitable now needs the go-ahead from the New York State Insurance
Department, which is overseeing the process, and a sale of shares to
investors should proceed this summer. The demutualisation process is of
intense interest to Axa, the large French insurer; it stands to receive up
to 49 per cent of Equitable's equity in return for a Dollars 1bn capital
infusion last year, assuming all goes smoothly.

Ultimate control will rest with the directors and management of the RMB

The deal brings together a relatively young life office  - Momentum is 25

MANY of the largest US retail groups reported fairly strong sales increases

out of recession.
Kmart posted a 5.5 per cent improvement in same-store sales, with its
general merchandise outlets registering a 4.9 per cent gain, and the
specialty chains returning a 7.3 per cent advance.
The one large retailer to show falling sales last month was Sears, Roebuck.
The Chicago-based company said total sales from its domestic stores were 3.9
per cent lower, with same-store sales down by 2.1 per cent.
Sears is showing a modest 2.8 per cent increase in same-store sales for the
first 13 weeks of its financial year.
Other mainstream department store groups all posted increases last month.
Dayton Hudson saw same-store sales rise by 3 per cent, while May Department
Stores managed a 5.9 per cent rise. JC Penney, boosted by strong clothing
sales, saw a 14.5 per cent rise, while Woolworth reported a 14.8 per cent
increase from comparable domestic stores.
The Gap, the specialty clothing chain which seemed to stumble slightly in
March, also posted a double-digit sales increase  - up 30 per cent overall
and 13 per cent on a same-store basis.
Meanwhile, Wal-Mart, the aggressive discount chain which is now the nation's
largest retailer in sales terms, reported a 13 per cent advance in
same-store sales.

UNIVERSAL Matchbox Group, the Hong Kong-based maker of Matchbox die-cast
miniature cars and trucks, is to be acquired by US toy maker Tyco Toys in a
deal valued at about Dollars 135m.
Tyco has offered Matchbox common shareholders Dollars 10.75 a share,
including Dollars 8 in cash and Tyco common stock. Matchbox, which last year
had earnings of Dollars 1.62m on sales of Dollars 167.5m, is controlled by
the company's chairman, Mr David Yeh, who holds more than 60 per cent of the
company's shares. Mr Yeh, who has agreed in principle to the acquisition, is
expected to join the Tyco board after the deal is completed.
If the deal goes ahead, it will make Tyco the third biggest US toy company
and will give the Mount Laurel, New Jersey-based company access to
Matchbox's distribution chain in overseas markets such as the UK and
Germany.
Tyco had its eye on the international market in recent years. Only last
week, it announced plans to establish a German subsidiary to handle the sale
and marketing of Tyco products in Germany. Similar subsidiaries have been
set up in the UK, Benelux, Luxembourg and France.
Only about 13 per cent of the company's Dollars 548.7m annual sales come
from overseas, against about 50 per cent of sales for Hasbro and Mattel, the
two biggest US toy companies.

<TEXT>
REPUBLIC Pictures, a small independent film producer and distributor that
also owns a large home video distribution business, has become the latest
company to offer itself as the saviour of Orion Pictures, the independent
Hollywood studio that filed under US bankruptcy law last year.
The bid from Republic  - which would offer Orion creditors a complex package
of cash and equity measures  - comes just two weeks after New Line Cinema
ended it efforts to rescue and acquire the troubled Orion.
New Line, another independent, said the kinds of demands made were too
difficult.
Orion, the studio that became famous for its nurturing of Woody Allen, filed
last December for protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of US
bankruptcy law.
At the time of its filing Orion  - 68 per cent owned by Mr John Kluge's
Metromedia group  - had been troubled by nearly Dollars 700m of debts and a
severe cash crunch.
Republic Pictures would take over Dollars 400m of commitments to creditors
by Orion and would offer creditors a secured interest-bearing note of
Dollars 150m to be issued by the merged company. Republic would also offer
creditors 10 per cent of the common stock of the merged company.
Mr Paul Wagner, an Orion executive, said the Republic offer 'looks good on
the surface' and would be reviewed by the company. Any such deal would
require the approval of Orion, its creditors and the New York bankruptcy
court.
In its 1991 fiscal year Orion lost Dollars 102.1m. In its last quarterly
results Orion lost Dollars 29.2m on revenues of Dollars 94.8m. Republic
Pictures made a net profit of less than Dollars 1m in fiscal 1991 on
revenues of Dollars 81.6m.

SIEMENS, the German electronics company, has agreed to acquire International
Business Machines' 50 per cent interest in Rolm Company, the marketing and
services arm of Rolm Systems, a California telecommunications equipment
manufacturer.
In 1989, IBM sold Rolm's manufacturing operations to Siemens but retained 50
per cent ownership of the marketing and service operation, which became a
separate company. With IBM's exit, the two Rolm companies will now be
consolidated, Siemens said.
The sale reflects IBM's recent determination to focus its efforts on its own
areas of expertise, while forming strategic partnerships with outside
companies to gain access to related technologies.
This is in sharp contrast to the expansionary mood in 1984, when IBM
acquired Rolm, a pioneer in the market for private branch exchange
equipment.
At the time, the acquisition was hailed as the beginning of a broad merger
of the telecommunications and computer markets that could result in IBM
competing head to head with telecommunications giants such as AT&amp;T.
In the event, Rolm failed to live up to IBM's expectations and slumped into
losses. IBM, which paid Dollars 1.5bn to acquire the company and spent an
estimated Dollars 1bn to support its losses and development costs, sold most
of its interest in Rolm to Siemens for Dollars 1.15bn, three years ago.
Yesterday, terms of the sale of IBM's remaining interest in Rolm Company
were not disclosed. IBM and Siemens said the two companies would continue to
maintain 'close, co-operative development and marketing efforts'.
'While this announcement represents a change in ownership, it does not
affect the excellent relationship we have with IBM,' said Mr Peter Pribilla,
president and chief executive officer of Rolm. 'Co-operative development
efforts through the IBM/Siemens technical operating committee will continue
to play an important role in our relationship.'
In France, IBM and Siemens are co-operating in the manufacture and
development of semiconductor memory chips.
Siemens said Rolm will in future operate under a single-management structure
and join Tel Plus Communications as part of Siemens' Private Communication
Systems division.

FT  08 MAY 92 / O&amp;Y in default on CDollars 17m payment

HOLDERS of a series of Olympia &amp; York bonds have declared the cash-strapped
property developer in default, and are threatening legal action if overdue
interest payments are not made next week.
O&amp;Y failed to make interest payments of CDollars 17m (Pounds 8m) last Monday
on CDollars 325m worth of bonds secured by First Canadian Place, a 72-storey
building in Toronto.
Under the bonds' trust indenture, O&amp;Y is barred from taking rent from the
property for itself before debt-service payments have been met.
Following a meeting on Tuesday, representatives of about three-quarters of
the bondholders have delivered a formal notice of default. O&amp;Y has until May
14 to make the payments.
The bondholders, which include several US and European institutions, are due
to meet their trustee, Royal Trust, in Toronto today. They are expected to
demand that Royal Trust assigns rents or seizes the building if O&amp;Y fails to
meet the payments by next Thursday. Royal Trust will put forward a
compromise proposed by O&amp;Y.
Alternatively, the bondholders are asking a group of Canadian banks, which
hold a third mortgage on the property, to meet the interest payments. They
contend that the banks have more to lose if the bondholders sell the
building in the current depressed market.
One investment adviser who represents several pension funds, said yesterday
he had 'a fiduciary duty to go after this vigorously'. He said the
bondholders were angry O&amp;Y had not consulted them in advance.
O&amp;Y faces the dilemma, however, that if these creditors are paid, others are
likely to demand equal treatment. For instance, a group of Japanese
institutions agreed last month to defer USDollars 62m (Pounds 34.4m) in
interest due on a Eurobond secured by part of Manhattan's World Financial
Centre.
Meanwhile, GW Utilities and Gulf Canada Resources, both controlled by O&amp;Y,
said they were jointly seeking a buyer for their combined 63.5 per cent
stake in Home Oil, a Calgary-based energy producer. The two companies have
appointed First Boston to arrange a sale.
At current market prices, GW and Gulf's stake in Home would fetch about
CDollars 600m.

FT  08 MAY 92 / Russia assures survival of Moscow Narodny Bank
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RUSSIA has guaranteed the survival and long-term prospects of Moscow Narodny
Bank by injecting more than Pounds 300m of new capital into the London-based
trade and project finance bank.
Although Russia is suffering from a shortage of hard currency, it has used
almost Pounds 310m of sterling and dollars to buy new preference shares in
Moscow Narodny, which was the main overseas commercial banking arm of the
former Soviet Union.
As a result, Moscow Narodny's issued share capital is now more than Pounds
500m, compared with its loans and other assets totalling Pounds 1.1bn at the
end of 1991.
It made a pre-tax loss last year of Pounds 121m, compared with a Pounds 5.8m
profit the previous year, mainly because it was forced to make a provision
of Pounds 131m to cover possible losses on loans. Most of these provisions
related to Pounds 500m of Russian loans. The bank said profit before
provisions was almost unchanged at Pounds 10.7m.
Last summer, Moscow Narodny's depositors began rapidly withdrawing funds as
they were losing confidence in the bank because of its exposure to the
disintegrating Soviet Union. Since then, Moscow Narodny has been trying to
reassure the financial community it has a long-term future, said Mr Andrei
Rozhdov, an assistant director. The bank, supported by the Bank of Eng-land,
persuaded Russia to convert much of its deposits with the London bank into
new capital.
With the break-up of the Soviet Union into the Commonwealth of Independent
States, ownership of Moscow Narodny changed. The Central Bank of the Russian
Federation is now controlling shareholder, replacing the Bank for Foreign
Economic Affairs.
Mr Bill Newman, assistant general manager, said profits in the current year
were likely to be hit again by big provisions against Russian loans. But he
was cautiously optimistic about the long term, saying deposits were
returning to the bank.
In future, Moscow Narodny will concentrate on five main areas: trading in
debt of the former Eastern bloc countries;
bullion trading;
counter trade, or the process of receiving payment for exports to Russia in
the form of commodities and goods;
trade finance;
arranging finance for construction projects.
