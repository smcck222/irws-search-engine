FT  30 APR 92 / Letter: When aid acts as a deterrent to foreign investment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Ms LUCY MARTINEZ-MONT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I read with great interest your survey 'Latin American Finance and
Investment' (April 6). I would like to see a similar survey on how foreign
aid interacts with financial change in Latin America.
In small countries like Guatemala, the amount of hard currency dumped on the
economy, through an array of foreign-aid programmes, sometimes exceeds 10
per cent of public spending. Many authors have denounced the high levels of
waste and corruption associated with foreign-aid grants. However, little has
been said on how foreign aid distorts the exchange rate in the recipient
countries.
I contend that foreign aid creates an exchange rate equilibrium through
which the value of the local currency increases vis-a-vis the US dollar (one
dollar buys less local currency units). This reduces the incentive for
private capital inflow and therefore the greater the amounts of foreign aid
as a percentage of GDP, the smaller the amounts of private foreign capital
that flow into the country.
It is interesting to note that the countries in Latin America which are
attracting greater amounts of private capital are the ones that have
received relatively small amounts of foreign-aid dollars as a percentage of
their GDP. Perhaps Guatemala, El Salvador, Paraguay, the Dominican Republic
and other small Latin American countries would do better in the 21st century
if Africa became the sole target for the charitable sentiments of rich
foreign governments.

FT  30 APR 92 / Letter: Political dimension of drug prices in EC
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr ANTHONY H WILD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your article, 'Car prices vary by 40 per cent in parts of EC' (April
27), very succinctly points out a major pricing problem in the EC. This
example pales into relative insignificance, however, if one looks at the 200
per cent-plus discrepancy between prices of pharmaceuticals in different EC
countries.
Also, unlike the case of retail car prices, the cause of the drug price
problem is a relatively simple one: artificial price fixing and squeezing by
some governments.
Politicians and bureaucrats find drugs to be the only sector of healthcare
where they feel it is politically possible to cut costs to balance their
books, without considering whether pharmaceuticals can save costs in the
long run by cutting down on hospitalisation and other costs.

FT  30 APR 92 / Leading Article: Kohl's moment of truth
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
WISE IMPERTURBABILITY or dangerous insouciance? Mr Helmut Kohl gained a
well-deserved reputation for the former quality as he presided over the
triumphant unification of Germany's two pieces two years ago. But in the
last few days, with his governmental coalition facing a rash of internal
squabbles and a spreading wave of labour unrest, the German chancellor's
unruffled posture has begun to look more like the latter. Either his nerve
is stronger than his current trade union opponents imagine, or he is riding
for a fall that will have worrying consequences throughout Europe.
The challenges are certainly daunting. The last time there were
public-sector strikes on this scale was in 1974, and on that occasion -
combined with a deep malaise in the centre-left coalition - they spelled the
downfall of Chancellor Willy Brandt. In the past few weeks, Mr Kohl has lost
three valued ministers; support for his CDU party is slipping in the polls;
and his government is having increasing difficulty containing spending in
the face of public sector pay demands and the rising costs of unification.
It no longer seems fanciful to ask whether the strains will prove too great
for the traditional, consensual ways of doing business in west Germany to
bear.
Unseemly jockeying
It would be wrong to overdo the parallels with past crises. Undeniably, Mr
Kohl's position has been weakened by the events of this week - especially
the announcement by Mr Hans-Dietrich Genscher, the veteran foreign minister,
that he intends to step down next month and the unseemly jockeying between
and within the coalition parties over the succession. Certainly this is
unfortunate at a time when the government's top priority should be - through
responsible fiscal behaviour and the Bundesbank's tight monetary policy - to
tame inflation without plunging Germany into recession.
But there should be no reason for the government to be brought down. Mr
Kohl's smaller coalition partners, the FDP and the CSU, may chafe at the
allocation of ministerial portfolios, but neither of them could seriously
contemplate jumping ship to join forces with the opposition social
democrats. The SPD is, if anything, in deeper disarray than the government
parties. Moreover, the CDU may be unpopular in the polls just now, but it
does not face any elections - at national or regional level - until 1994. As
Mr Kohl is well aware, he has a breathing space of about 18 months in which
to sort out his government's political and economic problems.
Excessive burdens
The important question is how he uses it. For if the chancellor is to
complete the task he began with unification, and engineer the transition to
a market economy in eastern Germany, without imposing excessive burdens on
the west, he will need to break with the style in which he has governed up
to now.
The immediate imperative is to hold the line on public sector pay. No matter
what pressure the unions apply, it would be immensely damaging if the
government were to climb down now from its determination to keep wage rises
below 5 per cent - in terms not just of public spending but also of the
signal such a move would send to private sector negotiators, and to the
Bundesbank.
Beyond that, the government needs to develop a clear and decisive strategy
for controlling its own finances in the face of the spiralling transfers to,
and debts being amassed in, the east. Such a plan is more easily called for
than elaborated, not least because the way revenues and expenditure are
apportioned at present between the federal government and the Lander (many
of them SPD-controlled) provides little incentive for spending reductions.
But Mr Kohl has done it before, in happier times - it was he, after all, who
presided over the marked reduction in Germany's budget deficit during the
1980s.
Running as a common strand through these issues is the need for candour
about the difficulties Germany now faces. The days are long gone when the
chancellor could claim that unification would be complete in a matter of
three to four years; everybody now knows it is a much deeper, costlier and
more enduring challenge. Mr Kohl will not be able to meet that challenge on
his own, but neither can it be overcome without him.

<TEXT>
MAYNARD KEYNES, AN ECONOMIST'S BIOGRAPHY
By D E Moggridge
Routledge. Pounds 35. 941 pages
John Maynard Keynes was one of the decisive thinkers and shapers of the
century. He pointed out that, in a market system, economies can stumble
along indefinitely in deep depression without any certainty that they will
necessarily correct themselves. A company can improve its position by
sacking workers and cutting investment, but not a whole economy.
Keynes had nothing but contempt for those who could not, or would not, see
beyond the operations of finance to the realities of jobs, incomes and human
needs. The idea that Britain could have plentiful unemployed labour and
materials and machinery lying idle, and yet could not 'afford' to build new
houses or roads or other public works was a 'delirium of mental confusion'.
Economics was, for Keynes, not a search for timeless truths, let alone a set
of inexorable laws by which we are obliged to live, providing wealth for
some and misery for others. Economics was a method of analysis, essentially
historical and empirical, a modest and hesitant attempt to apply reason to
current problems in order to alleviate them.
Because of his unique personal access to the centres of British life, Keynes
was able to mount persistent and ultimately successful campaigns to persuade
governments to adopt new approaches. From his experience as a Treasury
official during the First World War, when he was given huge responsibilities
for the overseas financing of the allied war effort, he understood the minds
and aspirations of politicians, civil servants, bankers and businessmen. He
mastered the complex processes of inquiry, debate, pressures and bargains by
which policy is actually made. Since he was clever, rich, self-assured,
well-connected, witty, arty, homosexual and usually right, he made many
enemies. But his life is a wonderful example of how ideas can make their way
into political action.
If, in the west, the second half of the century has largely escaped the
prolonged mass unemployment, damaging trade wars, and associated political
extremism which marked the inter-war years, much of the credit belongs to
Keynes.
In his large new book, D E Moggridge attempts a comprehensive account. As
Keynes himself noted in his vivid biographical sketches of economists, men
and ideas cannot be separated. Even the most innovative thinkers share the
spirit of their age.
Professor Moggridge was one of the editors of the excellent 30-volume
edition of Keynes's economic writings published between 1971 and 1989 by the
Royal Economic Society and Macmillan. He has also explored the huge archive
of personal papers (equivalent to another 100 volumes, he estimates) and
other public and private records.
He sticks closely to the documents and is more an editor than a biographer.
In a misjudged attempt to be comprehensive, he includes a great deal that
obscures and slows his narrative. When Keynes joins a committee we are given
the names and dates of the other members, and sometimes their subsequent
careers even if they never cross his path again. During the years when
Keynes was associated with the Bloomsbury group, he can scarcely have tea
without our having to be told whether Ottoline or Vanessa or Duncan or
Bunnie was there too. Although a Canadian, Moggridge easily slips into the
English reverential style, to which books on Bloomsbury seem especially
liable, whereby everybody who goes to this or that school or college, or who
becomes a member of this or that undergraduate club, remains for ever
beautiful and brilliant.
The chapters on the economic controversies include slabs of summaries from
Keynes's writings. However, Moggridge offers little explanation of the
issues and the choices to which they relate or of the comparative
magnitudes. Figures in, say, 1925 pounds are meaningless without some
indication of whether they were big or small or catastrophic in the
circumstances of the day. The book tells us what happened but seldom helps
us to understand why.
Did Keynes ever admit to himself that the book on which his reputation was
built, The Economic Consequences of the Peace, was seriously deficient? Why
is his most famous work, the General Theory, so tortuously obscure? When
Keynes wrote to persuade, his style was bold and colourful, full of vivid
and amusing metaphors, memorable images and striking phrases. Did Keynes
make this book inaccessible to keep out policymakers? Did Keynes's intense
feelings for Karl Melchior, whom he met at the post-Armistice negotiations,
influence his subsequent attitude to Germany, which was sometimes too
sympathetic? Many such questions remain largely unaddressed.
The best part of the book is the account of Keynes's successful efforts,
along with the American, Harry Dexter White, to devise and establish a new
postwar regime for international trade and payments. The International
Monetary Fund and the Gatt, which even former communist countries are now
eager to join, are among the most visible reminders of the scale of his
achievement.

Given television's supposed power, it is astonishing how little it is used
to publicise wrongs and, with luck, help to right them. Some series do have
a tradition of investigation ('World In Action', for instance) but that is
most unusual. All the more reason, then, to celebrate the role of Taking
Liberties which highlights miscarriages of social justice. Today's programme
(8.00 BBC2) takes up the case of the Moroccans who were persuaded to work in
Gibraltar when Spain closed the border in 1969 but, now that the political
situation has changed, are facing deportation. Equally rare are programmes
in which a single powerful opinion can be expressed without an opposing view
being used for 'balance'. Opinions on C4 (8.00) provides half an hour for
the expression of a single belief. Today Bob Tyrell, managing director of
the Henley Centre, predicts the weakening of group attitudes as the 'me
generation' of the Sixties ages. This Week investigates terrorist killing in
Northern Ireland but, for once, looks not at the IRA but at the Protestant
UDA which, since vowing a year ago to avenge every killing by the IRA, has
done just that (8.30 ITV).

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
No doubt like many readers, I had seen the reviews but not the play - not
until Thursday, by which time two new principals were safely ensconced in
Ariel Dorfman's tight, even-handed melodrama. Reading just two or three
reviews was enough, one discovered, to have learned almost everything about
the action, swift and spare as it is. All that is left is to watch it being
played out.
'Melodrama' is not meant insultingly, but it is the right word; the basis of
the piece is a volatile, violent confrontation which may or may not end in
murder. Several comparable plays have cropped up in recent years, often with
a feminist slant: a woman turns the tables savagely on a male oppressor,
generally after an attempted rape. Dorfman's version, however, enlists
broader resonances in its background - from the black years in Chile (or any
such place) when arbitrary arrests, torture and rape were commonplace, and
the problem now of how to live with that unredeemed past when the quondam
oppressors have slipped into respectable mufti.
The tension is well sustained, with the extra tease that Paulina's cornered
'oppressor' may be a case of mistaken identity - but not electrifying. One's
withers weren't wrung. Though the new heroine, the excellent Geraldine
James, captures her sympathetically overwrought character with precision,
she is not a creature with a really dangerous edge. We are quite sure that
if that gun ever goes off, it will be just an accident, or a result of
momentary panic. Perhaps her predecessor Juliet Stevenson suggested more
unpredictable depths; in any case, for Anglo-Saxon prejudices a passionate,
pistol-waving Latin American lady would present a naturally wilder threat.
Michael Byrne continues as her benign, ambiguous victim. Her temperate
husband is now Paul Freeman, whose part in the implicit moral debate, as
written, leaves him under-explored (why has he shied off discussing what
happened to Paulina, all these years?) and slightly weak-kneed: we have to
take his honourable gravitas on trust. At the end, it is doubly frustrating
that the crucial facts are never established - since we know perfectly well
that there could never have been a truth-of-the-matter, but at most only the
playwright's whim.

HOWARDS END (PG) Curzon Mayfair
GRAND CANYON (15) Odeon West End
MOBSTERS: THE EVIL EMPIRE (18) Plaza
RICOCHET (18) Cannons West End
JACQUOT DE NANTES (PG) Barbican MGM Tottenham Ct Rd
Are you sitting comfortably? Then off we go. The rattle of horses and traps;
the swish of Edwardian dresses; the tinkle of tea cups; the sight of great
British actors rolling up their sleeves to tackle Great English Literature.
It must be - it is - another Merchant-Ivory adaptation of EM Forster. With
Howards End the producer-director team continue their tradition of treading
angelically where other fools might rush in. Their new film, like A Room
With A View and Maurice, is a triumph of wit and delicacy, of non-obsequious
faithfulness to Forster and of mind over narrative maze.
Howards End, Forster's last major work to be filmed, is a novel with Laocoon
plot coils: the tale of two German-born sisters boldly bearing the banners
of art and moral idealism into the philistine Wilcox family. Margaret
Schlegel (Emma Thompson) befriends the dying Mrs Wilcox (Vanessa Redgrave)
and later marries wealthy widower Henry (Anthony Hopkins). Helen Schlegel
(Helena Bonham Carter), after a brief coup de foudre with young Paul,
declares war on the whole clan when her bank-clerk friend Leonard is ruined
by some casual bad advice from Henry.
But let us not strangle ourselves with plot. For Forster, these events were
narrative tracery hung on a vast arboreal structure of themes concerning art
and humanity. The novel begins with an exposition of Beethoven's 5th
symphony; goes on to baptise that mantric phrase for our time, 'Only
connect'; and sees in its tale of two families a fable about prose versus
passion.
Director James Ivory and screenwriter Ruth Prawer Jhabvala skip the mantric
phrase and turn the Beethoven passage into a few seconds of knockabout
lecturing by a mad musicologist (Simon Callow). Probably wise. A film is not
a novel, and abstractions like Prose and Passion must be incarnated in real
People.
Here Ivory's cast excels. Vanessa Redgrave, possessed of a seraphic
intensity not seen since the Delphic Sybil, spreads a glow over the early
scenes. She persuades you of her passion for Howards End - the house
talismanically tussled over throughout the book - and her staring-eyed
legato manner is a counterpoint to Hopkins's brusque, emotionally evasive
staccato. Misses Thompson and Bonham Carter make a matching counterpoint:
the first all grace, vivacity and anxious compromise, the second a Dresden
shepherdess turned disappointed romantic who hurls emotional darts from her
black-browed eyes.
The film sometimes slides towards cliche. Every Edwardian Summer gets its
rowing scene, but an idyllic river is the last place to stage Helen and
Leonard's doom-laden mutual seduction. And the music is somewhat
wall-to-wall, as if composer Richard Robbins had been bitten by Philip
Glass. But minor pains like this set off the major pleasure of the whole.
Merchant-Ivory again confound critics ready to deal out the 'lace-hankie'
insults. Their best films, far from being cinema's answer to Emily Post, are
prismatic visions of past times coloured, ironised and toughened by a modern
sensibility.
Lawrence Kasdan's Grand Canyon is about the urban crises that happen around
us daily. You know the kind of thing. You set out to see, say, a new James
Ivory film at your local Odeon and on the way are attacked by muggers,
accosted by Jehovah's Witnesses and shot in the leg by a runaway bank
robber.
These and similar things happen to LA business executive Kevin Kline; and/or
to wife Mary McDonnell, film producer pal Steve Martin and black tow-truck
driver Danny Glover, whom Kline befriends in scene one after being rescued
by him from a band of inner-city thugs.
Kasdan's film is so all-inclusive that it resembles a Which? report on urban
survival. It also has a sickly, messagey ending when the cast gaze out over
the real Grand Canyon and wonder at the beauty of Nature's great divide as
opposed to the great divides that humans place between themselves and -
blah, blah, blah, we get the point.
No need of this to crown a film that displays at best a lithe and likable
wit and a fresco-like breadth. Kasdan, wearing his social anatomist's hat
(The Big Chill) rather than his genre practitioner's (Body Heat, Silverado),
gives us characters pierced through with quiet desperation. Kline's
middle-aged yuppie, guiltily flirting with his nervous-eyed secretary (Mary
Louise Parker), is as much overdue for spiritual counselling as his wife,
who wants to keep the abandoned baby she has found in a park while jogging
there.
Even more of a stretcher-case - literally - is film-maker Steve Martin. He
is shot in the leg by a mugger. Contrite, thoughtful, his limb in plaster,
Martin renounces all idea of returning to the blood-and-gore movies he once
lived off. Then, recovering, he changes his mind.
This too short cameo is the satirical jewel of the film. Kasdan should have
tipped the balance towards him and away from the racial harmony subplot
between Kline and trucker Glover. This is scored for maudlin,
make-the-world-better dialogue worthy of The Cosby Show. But the film, 2 1/2
hours long, pounds persuasively on even over its own potholes and presents
an LA far more convincing than the brainless Lotusland usually immortalised
for us by its denizens.
Mobsters: The Evil Empire tries to do for the truth-based gangster film what
Young Guns did for the Western. For young Billy the Kid read young Lucky
Luciano (Christian Roberts), Meyer Lansky (Patrick Dempsey) and Bugsy Siegel
(Richard Grieco). Growing up from delinquent childhood into arrested
adolescence, these glamorised psychotics carve up New York's organised crime
industry even as they carve up, more literally, their enemies.
In this sepia-hued would-be epic directed by ex-commercials whiz kid Michael
Karbelnikoff, cheeks are slashed, noses bitten off and craniums pierced by
ice picks. A thousand bullets puncture twitching bodies in saunas or
restaurants. A man is dangled from a penthouse before plunging to his death.
(We hear the final crunch, splat).
As if this were not enough for impressionable filmgoers, we have Michael
Gambon sauntering onto screen with an Italian accent: 'When ah keem frahm
Seecily . . .' But Gambon is the most magnetic thing around as a pouchy-eyed
crime kingpin, closely followed by rival capo Anthony Quinn, roaring like a
wounded bull over every tableful of pasta he consumes or destroys. The
younger actors never match the older and there lies the rub. The film is
like watching 'Bugsy Malone: The Next Generation' as, amid the
Godfather-surplus sets, Hollywood's newest brat pack demonstrates it is
marginally duller than the old one and infinitely duller than the veterans
showing off around them.
Ricochet, a crime thriller from director Russell Mulcahy (Highlander), is
never dull even while it is silly. We do not believe one moment of this tale
about a cop (Denzel Washington) being pursued Cape Fear-style by a psycho
(John Lithgow) he once put behind bars. But we have a great deal of fun not
believing it. Especially when the finale defies both gravity and
plausibility atop LA's picturesque Watts Towers.
Or you may prefer Agnes Varda's Jacquot De Nantes. The French film-maker
assembles memories of her late husband, director Jacques Demy, and sticks
them into a moving photo album. Disporting on a beach in Super-8 is the
ageing Demy, grizzled veteran of Lola and Les Parapluies De Cherbourg.
Working behind the scenes to turn him into a fictionalised little boy,
playing in flashback with his first movie camera, is Mlle Varda. Deft,
delicate, touching.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAX LOPPERT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Vespers of 1610 remain one of the most elating experiences music can
offer. In Westminster Abbey on Tuesday I spent 100 minutes of rapturous
absorption sucked into their unfolding as though I had never heard them
before. Scholars advise that they are not to be thought of as a 'whole
work', that the order of their component sequences is by no means fixed, and
that the exact combination of performing forces must remain a matter of
dispute and debate. Yet when one encounters a performance so filled with
animation, exaltation and bounding vitality as that by the Collegium Musicum
90 and Westminster Singers under Richard Hickox, it becomes impossible not
to succumb to the succession of movements as a totality.
For the occasion Hickox had mapped out a path of wise moderation between the
executive extremes that have marked recent fashions in putting on the
Vespers - the sumptuous large-choral, large-instrumental feast on the one
hand and the ascetic, single-instrument and choir-of-soloists meditation on
the other. By employing a chamber choir, a band of period instruments and a
team of eight soloists, the conductor ensured that both the private and
public faces of Monteverdi's invention - the devotional pleadings and the
splendid celebrations through corporate virtuosity - received their due.
He took many of the movements at a speed which taxed the choir's agility
while building up an exhilarating sense of forward movement. The Abbey is,
of course, a wonderful place for the Vespers. When solo singers are planted
at far ends of the building, or in the pulpit, or high above the choir
stalls, a balance of space, intimacy and reverberance is achieved that
allows the music to be at once awesome and intimate - 'personal' in the way
that stamps, say, the 'Duo Seraphim' as one of the key expressions of
Italian humanism in music.
Among his group of soloists Hickox had found himself two tenors - Mark
Tucker and Lynton Atkinson, young Englishmen both - whose vocal attack,
colouring of tone and response to words proved blessedly free of the dreaded
Anglo-Saxon good manners that in some circles pass for 'authenticity', and
that continue to dog British revivals of Monteverdi. In the 'Duo Seraphim'
the two duetted in a spirit of athletic competitiveness as well as of
artistic comradeship. Mr Atkinson's outstandingly eloquent contribution to
'Audi coelum' was in the best way worthy of an Italian tenor's: openly
engaged with the rhetoric of the musical expression, alive to emotional
nuances. If only more modern Monteverdi singing showed a similar engagement
with the italianita of the vocal writing]
The Vespers, given under the auspices of Opera London Concerts in aid of
Save the Children and other charities, will be repeated at Salisbury
Cathedral on Saturday.

This orchestra is substantially that which plays for operatic productions at
the Milan theatre of the same name. A decade ago, when Claudio Abbado was La
Scala's music director, he determined to give the band the chance to broaden
its scope with purely symphonic concerts, and now under Carlo Maria
Giulini's guidance the orchestra, taking its mission very seriously, has a
Beethoven symphony cycle underway, being recorded by Sony. At its London
debut in Barbican Hall on Monday night, the orchestra under Giulini showed
us what it can do with the eighth and third symphonies.
Alas, it was not much at all. Good symphony orchestras are ever in short
supply in Italy and La Scala Philharmonic sets a high enough technical
standard to give its compatriot ensembles pause; but on Monday's evidence
one is bound to say that this orchestra cannot begin to compare with those
which routinely occupy London's halls. That the concert should have been
promoted as part of a 'Great Orchestras of the World' series was entirely
preposterous.
The violins were sprightly (the leader impressive); there were odd moments
of individual flair (first bassoon in the eighth symphony's third movement);
the overall sound was solid, on occasion vigorous, and steadfastly unlovely.
That in itself is not a decisive objection in the performance of these
works: Beethoven's orchestration is hardly a sensuous treat. But it mattered
greatly that ensemble was so consistently loose and intonation so
unreliable. The woodwind were the sourest offenders in the latter regard: I
have seldom heard such crashingly indifferent woodwind playing.
Most perturbing of all, though, was Giulini's indifference. The vibrant
spirituality for which his interpretations are famed had given place here to
dull, dutiful, Kapellmeister-ish time-beating. Tempi were plodding,
attention to dynamic shading was minimal, and hardly any desire to secure
refinement of phrasing was evinced. The performances were not without
sonorous energy but it was of a crude, over-driven sort such as threatened
to overwhelm and crush the first movement of the light-boned eighth
symphony. The Eroica was sluggish and untidy and remarkably uninspired.

FT  30 APR 92 / People: New lives for Chalmers, Shaw and Thoresen
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Two big life assurance companies have appointed new chairmen.
National Mutual Life, based in Hitchin, Herts, has appointed Norman Chalmers
(left) to succeed Sandy Pease, who is retiring after 17 years as chairman
and 29 years as a director.
National Mutual is a small life office, and very much a 'niche' player - it
produces only pensions, rather than general life insurance products, and it
markets them exclusively through independent brokers and advisers.
It has a reputation as one of the more traditional offices and with
Chalmers' background this seems unlikely to change much; he is a freeman of
the City of London and is on the Court of the Worshipful Company of
Gardeners. He trained at the Royal Military Academy at Sandhurst, and went
on to serve as an officer in the Black Watch, before qualifying as an
accountant.
Britannia Life, which also has a new chairman, is a very different animal.
The change in personnel reflects a move to integrate Britannia Life more
fully into Britannia Building Society, of which it is a wholly owned
subsidiary.
Calum MacLeod, the out-going chairman, steps down on the completion of his
five-year term. When he started, the company was a mutual society, called FS
Assurance. However, he will continue as deputy chairman of Britannia Life,
which is building a new headquarters in Glasgow.
Meanwhile, the new chairman will be Michael Shaw (centre), managing director
of the main building society. The aim is to establish 'a more direct
reporting line to the society's management and board'.
And at Royal Life International a replacement has been found for Richard
Gough, the previous managing director lured away to set up Sun Life's new
offshore life company.
Otto Thoresen (right), 36, will be RLI's new chief executive. Of Norwegian
extraction, but with a Scottish accent, he is currently managing director of
Royal Life on the mainland, and has previously worked in marketing for Abbey
Life and Scottish Equitable.
Thoresen will be based in RLI's impressive, if slightly incongruous, new
head office just outside Castletown at the southern tip of the Isle of Man.
It is the largest life company on the island, with 170 employees, and the
appointment of a man with a marketing background may signal further
determination to find new outlets for its products. At present it has many
customers in the Middle and Far East, but it is keen to move further away
from the company's traditional exatriate market, and also reduce its
dependence on one-off single premium products.

The media planning and buying group Aegis has announced the death on Tuesday
evening of Francis Gross, co-chairman and one of the two founders of Carat,
the main Aegis operating subsidiary. He would have been 57 yesterday.
One of the international giants of the media buying business, Gross joined
his brother Gilbert, who first set up Carat in 1969. Peter Scott, chairman
of Aegis, said: 'Francis was one of the innovators and founders not just of
Carat but of the European industry of media planning and buying. He was a
man of immense inspiration and will be greatly missed.'
Awarded the Legion d'Honneur in January 1989, Francis Gross took a leading
role in Carat until some six months ago, when cancer was diagnosed. His
major achievement in Carat was not simply to have built a successful company
but to have extended that success internationally.
*****
Gisela Gledhill is leaving Bass, the brewing, hotels and leisure group,
where she has been company secretary since 1989, to take up a similar
appointment at Wellcome, the pharmaceuticals group. Bass has appointed
Philip Bowman, finance director, as company secretary pending the
announcement of a successor.

FT  30 APR 92 / Business Law: Long arm of US antitrust law
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CELIA HAMPTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
On April 3, the US Justice Department issued the following policy statement
on the extension of US antitrust enforcement policy to non-US markets:
"The Department of Justice will, in appropriate cases, take antitrust
enforcement action against conduct occurring overseas that restrains US
exports, whether or not there is direct harm to US consumers, where it is
clear that:
1) the conduct has a direct, substantial and reasonably foreseeable effect
on exports of goods or services from the US; (2) the conduct involves
anti-competitive activities which violate the US antitrust laws - in most
cases, group boycotts, collusive pricing and other exclusionary activities;
and
(3) US courts have jurisdiction over foreign persons or corporations engaged
in such conduct.
This policy statement in no way affects existing laws or established
principles of personal jurisdiction.'
This statement was not innovative. It merely revoked a decision, expressed
in a footnote to a 1988 policy statement, to reserve such action for cases
where US consumers were harmed.
The decision is nevertheless disheartening. World trade is in a delicate
state, poised between free trade and managed trade between blocs: it is not
a good time to make assertive noises.
Nor is the move likely to be to the taste of other governments which take a
more modest view of their right to interfere in business conduct beyond
national frontiers.
On the positive side, the US policy signalled that it will be confined to
cases of deliberate and obvious anti-competitive conduct: the examples given
are among those which US law treats as anti-competitive as such ('per se'),
and it is made clear that the words 'other exclusionary activities' will be
taken to mean only those of a similar type (for example, market-sharing and
bid-rigging).
The enigmatic statement about 'personal jurisdiction' also provides some
comfort to foreign companies. It dispels an early anxiety that companies
with a US subsidiary would be subject to US jurisdiction for that reason
alone, or that the US subsidiary would be answerable for its foreign
parent's conduct abroad. The Justice Department will stick to the normal
rules, though these are not altogether comforting.
The responsibility of a US subsidiary for its parent's behaviour will depend
on how independent the subsidiary is. Foreign parent companies would be wise
to secure as much autonomy for their subsidiaries as is commercially
feasible.
The courts' treatment of a foreign subsidiary virtually as an arm of the US
parent, for example, in obeying a US political boycott, is not promising.
For the purposes of US domestic liability, the mere import of a foreign
company's products into the US is not regarded as enough to establish
jurisdiction over the foreign producer. But the level of contact with the US
market needed to bring a foreign company within the US courts' jurisdiction
can seem minimal, according to Mr Mark Cymrot of Baker &amp; Hostetler in
Washington DC. Owning property, providing an after-sales service or
negotiating with a customer in the US may be sufficient.
It might be argued that the US courts would be less willing to try foreign
subjects' liability where the issue arose abroad.
The Justice Department says that it 'will continue its longstanding policy
of considering principles of international comity' (comity means respect for
the other country's way of doing things). It will also notify and consult
with foreign governments before taking action (for example, under the 1991
EC-US antitrust co-operation agreement). But the US courts are the final
arbiter of this question.
Enforcing antitrust law is not the sole prerogative of the Department: about
90 per cent of all antitrust lawsuits are brought by private parties, who
can claim treble damages.
The new policy makes no change to this situation, but the Department's
renewed determination to act may encourage private lawsuits.
Problems also arise out of the differences between US and other competition
laws. US law may be good, but it is not universal. Other societies endorse
the rules which they find most effective and best suited to their needs.
Some rules may be looser, others tighter. Few other countries endorse
enforcement through US treble-damages private lawsuits.
The Justice Department dilutes its reassurance about 'comity' when it goes
on to say: 'If the conduct is also unlawful under the importing country's
antitrust laws, the Department of Justice is prepared to work with that
country if that country is better situated to remedy the conduct and is
prepared to take action against such conduct pursuant to its antitrust
laws.'
This sounds rather decent - letting another country enforce its own
competition policy on its own market - but it also warns that the Department
may not be 'prepared' to leave it to that country if local action fails to
protect US interests as well as US law would.
Most countries would draw a line between protecting the domestic market from
foreign-source abuse and enforcing the domestic rights of citizens abroad
from abuse on the foreign market. The US does not.
An explanation may lie in the legal differences. US law treats as one what
many laws treat as two distinct issues: competition law and unfair
competition. Unfair competition is largely unknown to the English common
law, which was the grandfather of US law.
When the US Congress passed the Sherman Act in 1890, it created a single
protection of 'trade and commerce' which combined both the protection of
competition on the market and the private protection of competitors. It
gives rise to public and private rights of action, both on behalf of the
market and of competing suppliers. This was not entirely followed by
competition laws elsewhere.
Competition law aims to secure free competition between suppliers on a given
market; where the product or service comes from is largely irrelevant. It
may give rise to private rights, but incidentally rather than as its
purpose. Unfair competition law gives a supplier a private right of action
for compensation against someone who damages his capacity to compete.
As far as competition law jurisdiction is concerned, there is an analogy
with the traditional criminal jurisdiction over conspiracy, which is to be
tried where it takes effect on the victims: the illegality of the conspiracy
should be judged by the standards of the place where the harm is suffered.
Injury to competition would normally be tried in the market where it
occurred. But, if treated as conspiracy, it can logically be extended to
cartels agreed abroad but taking effect on the domestic market - a principle
accepted in the European Community as well as in the US.
The situation covered by the US policy is not the same.
If US companies are excluded from a foreign market by a conspiracy, the
competition loss is on that market. It would also be normal to sue for
unfair competition in the place where the harm was done or where the
defendants (parties to the cartel) were resident, that is, the foreign
market.
However, if the cartel were treated as a conspiracy to cause harm to US
exporters, it could be said that the effect on the victims - the US
companies' lost export profits - took place in the US.
In that event, the narrower rules of criminal jurisdiction over foreigners
should apply.
Many US lawyers are dismayed by the reinstatement of the Justice
Department's policy. Not everyone shares Assistant Attorney General James F
Rill's faith in US antitrust law: 'Some observers have gone as far as
describing the American belief in competition principles, embodied in our
antitrust laws, as having almost a religious aspect. I readily admit to
being a disciple of the faith in competition' (Paris, 1989).
Few would disavow competition as a worthy object of devotion, but a great
many do not believe that it is exclusively embodied in US antitrust law -
and certainly not in US enforcement of it.

FT  30 APR 92 / Management: Banking on an ethical approach
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ethics are hardly a normal theme of corporate advertising, but they form the
centrepiece of an ambitious campaign to be launched by the Co-operative Bank
tomorrow which stresses businesses with which it refuses to be associated.
Few attempts to restructure a company can have been so fundamentally linked
to marketing objectives or as widely tested among existing customers.
Terry Thomas, managing director and the bank's first marketing director when
he joined in the early 1970s, makes no secret that the ethical stance is
designed to win new business.
The issues highlighted were approved by 30,000 of the bank's 1.5m customers
canvassed in a questionnaire late last year.
Those most widely supported - arms exports, environmental damage,
cosmetics-testing on animals and human rights - are the ones to be used.
The first two television advertisements - which will appear in three
northern TV regions, reflecting the bank's heartland - focus on
environmental damage and arms exports.
They are striking for their simplicity, mostly filmed in black-and-white,
with a series of sketched stills accompanied by a voice-over.
There is a long silence before the final message: that some banks will use
depositors' money for unethical purposes, while the Co-op will not.
'They stand in contrast to typical financial services ads which are glossy,
colourful and often criticised for not living up to expectations,' says
Simon Williams, head of marketing. 'Ours are stark, straight-talking and
come as quite a shock.'
Press advertising will include the broadsheet newspapers and specialist
magazines catering to some of the interest groups likely to respond to the
issues the bank is raising.
The bank is coy about the costs of the campaign, although the bill is
believed to be more than Pounds 1m.

FT  30 APR 92 / Accountancy Column: Six ways to improve the profession's
image
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEOFFREY HOLMES and ALAN SUGDEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT HAS become fashionable for shareholders to blame the auditors when a
company suddenly collapses into the arms of a receiver. 'Why didn't the
auditors give us any warning?' cry shareholders who have just seen their
investment disappear down the tubes.
In a research paper on 'company pathology' last year, County NatWest found
that only two of the 45 listed, USM and third market companies that called
in the receivers in 1989 and 1990 had received any qualification from the
auditors in their last published report and accounts. In these two cases,
one was trivial because it merely referred to an oversight by the previous
auditors, and the other obvious, because the company was clearly already in
deep trouble.
We suggest there are six issues which deserve attention. First, the present
accounting rules give companies too much scope for subjective judgment. For
example, why should companies be given the choice between merger accounting
and acquisition accounting, which usually produce totally different
outcomes? And why should UK companies, unlike those in most of the rest of
the western world, be allowed almost complete flexibility in deciding how
much to provide for deferred tax?
As a result of this 'provide as you please' policy and other laxities in our
accounting rules, a Touche Ross survey in 1989 found the UK has the most
over-stated profits in Europe: a factor of 1.28 compared with an average of
1.00, and only 0.88 in Germany.
The second problem is that, despite the ritual of their annual
re-appointment at the AGM, the auditor is the hired servant of the
directors. If you don't agree, name one listed company where the auditors
have been appointed, re-appointed or dismissed other than on the
recommendation of the board.
The truth is that the external auditor often helps the financial director
show his results in the best possible light, taking advantage of all the
loopholes.
One important reason why the auditor is keen not to offend the finance
director and the chief executive, apart from wanting to retain the audit, is
the opportunity it gives for providing the client with management
consultancy and other lucrative services. Two or three years ago some firms
were boasting that only 40 per cent of their income came from auditing.
A requirement to disclose any non-audit remuneration paid by audit clients
will enable shareholders to see by just how much the auditor is in the
directors' pocket. But the question is: should he be in their pocket at all?
We believe the second way to improve the profession's image would be to
preclude firms and their associates from providing any other services to
their audit clients.
The third problem is that the auditor only reports once a year, and an awful
lot can go wrong in 12 months. A classic case was the manufacturing and
entertainments group Parkfield. In January 1990 Parkfield announced interim
profits of almost Pounds 10m with earnings per share of 17.7p, almost double
those in the corresponding period a year earlier. Mr Roger Felber, the
chairman, stated that the company was 'in a strong position to maintain over
the coming years our exceptional record of growth in earnings per share'.
Six months later the group collapsed with debts of more than Pounds 300m
after the auditor had declined to sign his report. Had the interim results
been vetted by the auditor, the situation might have been recognised early
enough to stave off disaster.
Another example of differences between interim and audited final results
emerged in the recent Petrocon bid for Wilkes.
In 1989 Wilkes reported a pre-tax profit of Pounds 2m for the six months to
30th June, and the chairman proudly drew attention to the rise in earnings
per share of some 85 per cent.
A different story emerged from a circular to shareholders distributed less
than three months later, which gave a profit forecast for the full year of
not less than Pounds 2.3m. It showed that the Pounds 2m figure had included
a profit of about Pounds 1.1m on the sale of a property (a fact not
mentioned in the interim statement), for which completion was not due to
take place until June the following year.
Without that property profit, earnings per share would not have risen by an
impressive 85 per cent; they would have fallen by about 10 per cent. To add
to the problem, the property deal fell through, so the shareholders never
got the benefit even in the following year.
So our third point for giving shareholders more confidence in the auditors
would be for interim reports to be audited, notwithstanding the extra cost,
and for auditors to have a monitoring role throughout the year.
But returning to Parkfield, at the meeting of shareholders to receive the
report of the joint administrators and to hear a statement by the
ex-directors, two matters were clear. One was that Mr Felber, the former
chairman by then residing in South America, had wielded too much executive
authority. The other was the open admission by the directors that the
collapse had taken them by surprise.
So this leads us to our fourth point, that the auditor should be required to
comment on the adequacy or otherwise of the financial information provided
to the board.
A different example of the board being caught unawares was the currency
trading disaster at Allied Lyons last spring, which cost the group Pounds
147m. As Sir Derrick Holden-Brown, the chairman, reported: 'The group's
auditors have now completed a full investigation into the circumstances and
will be making recommendations on controls and reporting procedures within
the Allied Lyons treasury.' A pity it hadn't been part of the auditor's
normal duties to do so.
Our fifth point is that auditors should not be the only ones to get the
stick when problems are covered up by 'smart' accounting. Isn't the finance
director just as much to blame? After all, he is responsible for the
preparation of the accounts. And what about other qualified accountants on
the board? Should they not ensure that the figures give as accurate a
picture as possible? Ought they not to have the professional integrity to
speak up against financial jiggery-pokery?
Our sixth measure would be for any accountants who are shown to have
connived in deceiving shareholders and the market to be publicly rebuked. A
start has been made by the Financial Reporting Review Panel in admonishing
companies which have been caught enhancing their results unduly.
We would like to see the executive and non-executive accountants on the
boards of those companies being named and, in flagrant cases, being reported
to the disciplinary committees of their professional bodies.
Finally, coming back to where we began: the lack of warning that auditors'
reports give of impending disaster. Our sixth way to improve the
accountant's image would be to require the auditor to draw attention in his
report to items of significance buried in the notes. This could include
changes to accounting policies, the capitalisation of interest and other
costs, contingent liabilities of significant size (excluding those within
the group), and profits taken on sales to joint ventures.

FT  30 APR 92 / Number of fires at 14 year high
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE number of fires in 1990 was the highest for 14 years and deliberate
arson attacks on cars have almost doubled, according to figures released
yesterday.
Fire brigades attended 467,000 fires in 1990, up 11,000 on the previous year
and the largest number since 1976, the Home Office said.
Numerous grassland fires in the summer are believed to have increased the
figure.
Fires started deliberately in cars went up by 45 per cent in a year,
amounting to almost half of all fires in cars.
Overall, the number of people dying in fires remained steady at about 900.
Smoke alarms detected more fires than ever, but that still amounted to fewer
than 5 per cent of house fires. They seem to have cut deaths in household
blazes, although those still account for 70 per cent of fire fatalities.
Deaths in homes fell to 627, the lowest since 1971.

FT  30 APR 92 / Estate agents' image improved, Borrie says
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE RECESSION and tighter regulations governing estate agents are combining
to improve the image of the profession, Sir Gordon Borrie, director-general
of fair trading, said yesterday.
Complaints were still being made, he said, but the image of estate agents
had improved, he told the annual conference of the National Association of
Estate Agents in London.
'A short time ago, the image of estate agents could hardly have been worse,'
Sir Gordon said.
'Any stand-up comedian searching for an easy laugh could . . . (conjure) up
a picture of a wide boy with a cellular phone making a fortune out of other
peoples' homes with very little effort.'
But the recession meant 'a number of people' had left the estate agency
business.
'When you add to that the greater requirements of the new regulations, the
image of the estate agent has improved. I see no reason why it should not
improve.'
The Office of Fair Trading had banned about 155 estate agents from the
property business in the past 10 years, and recently the rate of expulsions
had increased.
There was also a rise in complaints about estate agents.
'There is a greater awareness among the public that there are complaints
procedures and things can be done,' Sir Gordon said.
Mr David Ware, association chairman, said there should be a compulsory
registration scheme for estate agents to stop people with no qualifications
opening property offices.
It would be impractical to require every agent to have a licence but at
least one person should hold such a qualification in every estate agency
office, he said, adding that an upturn in the market was likely to mean
'cowboy' agents making a comeback.
Against that, Sir Gordon said a licensing system might lead to less choice
for consumers and increase the cost of selling a home.

FT  30 APR 92 / Jobs cut in TUC survival scheme
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A 20 per cent cut in the number of staff employed by the Trades Union
Congress was confirmed yesterday by the TUC's ruling general council as part
of a survival plan to deal with falling membership.
About 40 jobs will go across the organisation through early retirement and
voluntary severance - no compulsory redundancies are likely. The equal
rights department will amalgamate with the social and environmental
department, although jobs related to race and sex equality are likely to be
protected. Offices in the south-east and East Anglia will be amalgamated, as
will those in the east and west Midlands.
The general council also agreed in principle to link rises in affiliation
fees more closely to rises in unions' own charges to their members. The move
is designed to stabilise income and enable a greater degree of forward
planning.
Deficits of Pounds 250,000 during this calendar year, Pounds 1m in 1993 and
Pounds 1.5m in 1994 were projected if the job cuts had not gone ahead.
Overall union membership has dropped from a peak in 1979 of 12m to a current
figure of 8m, the lowest since the early 1950s.
The move has caused internal dissent and staff have passed a motion of no
confidence in Mr Norman Willis, the TUC's general secretary, over the
handling of the cash crisis.
There has also been strong criticism from equal opportunity lobby groups and
internal regional interests.
At the same time, the role of the TUC is increasingly being called into
question, particularly by some of the larger unions, which are calling for
greater value for money from their substantial affiliation fees. The
formation of 'super unions' through amalgamations is also diminishing the
TUC's central role.

FT  30 APR 92 / Nurses concerned at role of pay body
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DIFFERENCES emerged yesterday between the Royal College of Nursing and the
government over how National Health Service trusts should interpret
recommendations from the independent nurses' pay review body.
Mr Phil Gray, RCN director of labour relations, told reporters at the annual
congress in Blackpool trusts should use nationally recommended pay levels as
a baseline on which they could improve if they wished.
The Department of Health believes trusts should use national rates as a
'benchmark', or rough guide.
Trusts in theory are able to offer lower rates at the local level.
Earlier this week, Mrs Virginia Bottomley, the Health Secretary, addressing
the congress, refused to bind NHS trusts to observe pay levels set by the
pay review body.
It would be kept as a benchmark but trusts 'must be free to fix their own
rates,' she said.
No trust has yet offered rates of pay lower than those set by the review
body. The vast majority have this year stayed with nationally recommended
rates, although some have varied national terms and conditions of
employment.
Some 90 per cent of nurses are still covered by the terms of the pay review
body, because staff who have transferred from local health authority control
to trusts can retain their terms and conditions of employment.
Mr Gray warned of chaos if there were wide variations of pay in a locality.

THE CREDENTIALS of Mr John Smith as the leadership candidate of Labour's

All but three of his shadow cabinet colleagues were among the 162 MPs who
nominated him. He also captured most of the new MPs and almost the entire
Scottish party, including its hard left.
His rival Mr Bryan Gould counted only two shadow cabinet leftwingers - Mr
Michael Meacher and Ms Jo Richardson - among his 63 supporters, as well as
his shadow environment colleagues and campaign managers, Mr David Blunkett
and Mr Clive Soley.
His other prominent supporters included the prominent Euro-sceptic and
former senior Cabinet minister, Mr Peter Shore, and Ms Clare Short from the
national executive committee.
Mr Robin Cook, shadow health secretary and Mr Smith's campaign manager, said
some 15 other MPs had indicated that they would support Mr Smith after
consulting their constituency parties.
Mr Ken Livingstone, the candidate of the left-wing Campaign group, captured
only half the faction's membership.
In the deputy leadership race, the bulk of the front bench formed the core
of Mrs Margaret Beckett's 89-strong support. Mr John Prescott, the third
challenger for deputy, won many of his 64 nominations from leftwing northern
and Scottish MPs.
The annual conference of the AEU engineering union, the third-largest union
affiliated to Labour, yesterday backed Mr John Smith and Mrs Margaret
Beckett as leader and deputy leader of the party. The AEU decided not to
ballot its members.

FT  30 APR 92 / Increase in Channel 4 advertising share seen
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CHANNEL 4 is likely to increase its share of advertising considerably when
it starts selling its own air time next year, according to James Capel, the
stockbrokers.
The ITV companies presently sell Channel 4's advertising air time and pay a
subscription of 17 per cent of advertising rev-enue to fund both Channel 4
and the Welsh fourth channel, S4C, which costs Pounds 55m a year.
From next year the government will fund S4C, which has had advertising
revenues of about Pounds 4m a year.
Mr Neil Blackley, media analyst as James Capel, believes that next year
Channel 4 will be able to earn 17.6 per cent of terrestrial advertising
revenue in its own right, with the possibility of winning a greater share if
it retains its audience.
At the same time, James Capel is downgrading its growth estimates for UK
commercial television this year from 8 per cent to 6 per cent without
including inflation.
As a result, James Capel is reducing its profit forecasts for most of the
ITV companies and argues that most ITV share prices should now 'at least
pause for breath'.

INDUSTRIAL action by 16,000 Royal Bank of Scotland staff is likely to

said yesterday.
The union launched an overtime ban and work-to-contract action before the
Easter weekend as part of its campaign of industrial action over pay. The
union will discuss new measures early next week.
It has rejected an offer of between 2.5 per cent and 3.5 per cent for

FT  30 APR 92 / Sharp rise in building orders
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CONSTRUCTION orders rose sharply during the three months to the end of
February, according to figures published yesterday by the Environment
Department, Andrew Taylor writes. But construction industry leaders were
swift to deny that this indicated that a recovery might have begun.
The department said public and private orders placed with contractors rose
by 2 per cent compared with the previous quarter and by 12 per cent compared
with the corresponding period 12 months earlier.
The Building Employers' Confederation, representing 7,000 companies with a
combined annual turnover of more than Pounds 30bn, said: 'The increase in
new orders is due almost entirely to an exceptional rise in public
non-residential orders in February - which could be due to just one very
large contract.
'We see no sign of recovery at this stage and are forecasting a further
sharp fall in construction output this year.'

FT  30 APR 92 / Congress asked to extend federal regulation of insurance
industry: A bill seeking SEC-type regulation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT and GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE US Congress, undaunted by its failure last year to pass coherent
legislation on the banking industry, is turning its attention to insurance.
Mr John Dingell, chairman of the House of Representatives energy and
commerce committee, has put forward a draft bill which would set up a
federal regulatory agency for the insurance industry, modelled along the
same lines as the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) which oversees
the capital markets.
Mr Dingell's bill would set up a federal certificate of solvency which would
authorise an insurer to write policies anywhere in the US without any other
regulation of its financial condition.
Foreign insurers applying for this federal certificate would have to set up
a trust fund in the US to satisfy the commission of their ability to meet
their policy holders' claims.
Companies engaged in reinsurance would, under Mr Dingell's proposal, have to
meet tougher capital standards.
The Dingell bill matches in many respects a proposal made last year by
Senator Howard Metzenbaum, although Mr Dingell does not go as far as Senator
Metzenbaum in transferring insurance regulation from the states to the
federal government. He would leave the regulation of insurance premiums to
each state.
Pressure for some measure of federal regulation in the US insurance industry
arises for two basic reasons.
The first is that the existing system of state regulation, dating from the
mid-19th century, is widely seen to have flaws. Each state enacts its own
laws, runs its own insurance department, operates its own guarantee funds
and has its own insurance commissioner.
The commissioner may be either elected or appointed by other state
officials. Where he is elected, insurance matters tend to develop an even
thicker political coating. For example, John Garamendi, the first elected
commissioner in California, is an ambitious Democrat, thought to have his
eyes on the governor's job. Many observers believe that his high-profile
actions - which have ranged from the seizure of First Executive, the large
life company, to an ongoing court battle to get car insurance rollbacks paid
out - are part of a larger political agenda.
It is true that, as insurance companies have become bigger and more complex,
the states have developed a fair degree of consistency. There is, for
instance, a standard format for financial reports. The National Association
of Insurance Commissioners, moreover, regularly formulates 'model' laws,
which often form the basis for state legislation.
Nevertheless, most industry practitioners acknowledge that regulatory
standards vary substantially from state to state.
Differences in state guarantee fund arrangements, which underpin
policyholders' contracts, have also been highlighted recently - during, for
example, the First Executive debacle. A small minority of states still lack
guarantee arrangements for certain types of contract: even California, a big
insurance market, only recently enacted a life/health guarantee fund.
Anxious to deflect federal oversight, the NAIC responsed with a new approval
system in June 1990. By formally 'accrediting' those states whose financial
standards conform to (or better) its model rulebook and whose supervisory
resources are deemed adequate, the NAIC hopes to presslaggard states into
improvements. So far, nine states have met the NAIC's standards, and more
accreditations may come in June.
But however intelligent and well-intentioned this response, critics of state
regulation still see a fundamental flaw: the NAIC has no legal powers to
compel the sloppier states to do anything.
The second reason for disquiet with the state-based regulatory system is
simpler still. Like other financial services businesses, insurers are
counting the cost of over-ambitious expansion in the heady Eighties.
Attention has centred primarily on the investment side of the business. Some
of the largest composite insurers - such as Aetna or Travelers - are busily
buttressing revenues to cover souring real estate-related holdings. Heavy
junk bond holdings, meanwhile, prompted policyholder runs, and subsequent
seizures, at First Executive, First Capital and others.
But the writing of some policies has been injudicious, too: witness
Equitable Life's problem with its 'guaranteed investment contracts'
(essentially savings contracts which promised an ambitious rate of return).
Meanwhile, on the property-casualty (non-life, non-health) side, few think
that the underwriting cycle has really begun to turn, and the move towards
'self-insurance' - as customers seek to defray the cost of mounting premiums
 -leads some pundits to believe that the cycle is undergoing a fundamental
structural change. In short, the health of the industry is not good.
The problem is summed up by figures of insurance company failures. According
to A. M. Best, the specialist rating agency, 271 property-casualty companies
have either been 'involuntarily dissolved' or placed under state supervision
over the past eight years, compared with 62 in the previous eight years.
Forty-six property-casualty companies had to shut their doors involuntarily
last year, the second-highest figure for more than a decade and a 44 per
cent increase on the 32 in 1990. Another 28 life/health companies were also
declared impaired or insolvent last year.
The Dingell bill seems to have generated a good deal of reading - 'It's the
size of the telephone book,' complained one New York-based insurance
executive - and relatively little public comment. The NAIC has set up a
working group to review the bill and expects to put out a detailed response
in the summer.
Many of the largest insurers are publicly supportive of the NAIC's stance.
'The NAIC has been working very hard to improve solvency regulation,'
commented Met Life, 'and the federal government has a pretty poor record
when it comes to financial institutions - especially the thrifts.'
Insurers also point out that they have a vested interest in good solvency
regulation at present - since, when a call is made on a state guarantee
fund, it is other insurers functioning in the same state who retroactively
supply funds. Perhaps one of the fiercest criticisms of the Dingell
proposals is that it would make solvency oversight a federal matter, yet
leave pricing and product supervision with the states.
That said, executives at some large, multistate companies concede privately
that a federal oversight agency might make life simpler. And, like the NAIC,
they generally accept that the federal government could usefully play a role
in matters of fraud and the regulation of non-US insurance companies
operating in the US.
Perhaps the final disincentive for congressmen is Mr Dingell's plan to
establish a National Insurance Protection Corporation to cover the claims of
policyholders whose insurers become insolvent.
Mr Dingell argues that this corporation would be pre-funded by a risk-based
levy on insurance companies.
But most congressmen have been so badly burnt by the experience of paying
for insolvent savings and loans and banks that they are unlikely to show
much enthusiasm for extending the federal umbrella over insurance
policyholders.

FT  30 APR 92 / Australian rate cut likely as quarterly inflation falls to
zero
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN DAWKINS, the Australian federal treasurer, yesterday forecast a cut
in official interest rates in the wake of zero inflation in the three months
to March.
Government figures showed that the consumer price index (CPI) was unchanged
over the quarter.
The annual rate rose, however, from 1.5 per cent to 1.7 per cent, the second
lowest figure recorded since March 1964.
The CPI figures also showed that the underlying rate of inflation fell to
0.4 per cent from 3 per cent a year ago. This is the lowest rate of increase
since publication of figures for underlying inflation began in 1971.
The unexpectedly low figures prompted the government to revise its inflation
forecast for the year to the end of June from 2.25 per cent to 2 per cent.
The 1992-93 forecast was also revised downwards by one percentage point to
2.5 per cent.
Mr Dawkins said the figures removed any doubts about the possibility of cuts
in official interest rates. However, he said the size of the forthcoming
reduction would not be determined until the next meeting of the Reserve Bank
of Australia board due on May 5.
'This figure certainly means that there is now room to have some relaxation
of monetary policy, which will return a dividend to the community as a
result of this substantial improvement on the inflation front,' Mr Dawkins
said.
Economists said the March quarter CPI outcome indicated that interest rates
were likely to fall by one percentage point, rather than the 0.5 percentage
point reduction the financial markets had been expecting.
The official cash rate was last cut by one point to 7.5 per cent in January.
Official rates peaked at 18 per cent in January 1990 as the government tried
to cool the overheated economy.
Mr Dawkins said there were 'convincing signs' that Australia was recovering
from a recession which led to six consecutive quarters of flat or negative
growth in GDP.

THE TAMIL Tiger separatist group in Sri Lanka has killed more than 55 Moslem
and Sinhalese in a pre-dawn attack on an agricultural settlement in the
country's eastern province which it claims as part of its traditional
homeland.
In retaliation, armed Moslems have killed 50 Tamils in a nearby vilage. The
Moslems speak Tamil but support the majority Sinhalese.
The Tigers accuse the Sinhalese-dominated government of trying to convert
the demographic character of the province through irrigation projects which
provide water for new settlements. Sinhalese and Moslem families are given
land while Tamils are not, the Tigers claim.
Tamil assaults have targeted isolated Sinhalese and Moslem settler farms.
Police said the Tigers used knives and axes in the latest attack.
A non-governmental commission in Nepal will investigate a series of police
shootings that left at least eight people dead in Kathmandu recently,
Agencies add.
Official reports say eight people died in the April 6 shootings, while an
unofficial count put the death toll at 17. Witnesses say police opened fire
after violence broke out during a one-day strike.
Burma's army fired mortar barrages at Karen guerrilla bases on the Thai
frontier on Tuesday after Rangoon announced it was suspending its offensive,
a Karen spokesman said yesterday.
The Karens have fought for several decades for greater autonomy from central
government.
The Burmese military junta meanwhile released 11 more political prisoners
yesterday, bringing the total of detainees freed to 38 since General Than
Shwe became prime minister last week, state radio said.

FT  30 APR 92 / South prepares common stance for Rio summit: Developing
country talks on the environment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   KUALA LUMPUR
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MALAYSIA had some success this week in portraying the negotiations over the
forthcoming Earth Summit in Brazil as part of a century-old fight between
the rich, polluting, industrialised countries of the north and the poor,
developing nations of the south.
Dr Mahathir Mohamad, the outspoken Malaysian prime minister who opened a
pre-summit meeting of 55 developing countries in Kuala Lumpur, declared that
the north's fears of global environmental degradation had given the south
new leverage in its quest for development aid.
The north, he said, was responsible for 80 per cent of pollution and had
destroyed its own environmental heritage; it should clean up its own
backyard instead of laying claim to the environmental resources of the
south.
'It is wrong that we should be made scapegoats for the past sins of the
north,' he said. 'The north is still subjecting us to imperial pressures.'
His audience applauded because they agreed with much of what he said, but
delegates (from the south) and observers (from the north) said privately
that there was no point antagonising potential donors or turning the Earth
Summit in June into just another political battle between north and south.
Despite the profound differences within both the developing and the
developed worlds, it is now possible to discern a common set of opinions
which the poorer countries will present in Rio de Janeiro and a common set
of responses from most industrialised countries.
Broadly, the governments of developing nations believe that some
environmental assets must be sacrificed for the cause of development, and
that they have the right to a fair proportion of 'environmental space' - or
the earth's ability to absorb environmental damage; they have the right to
exploit their sovereign natural resources as they see fit.
Because the industrialised countries have grown rich on over-exploiting the
world's environmental space, the south says, they must release some space
(by reducing their pollution), create some more space (by reafforestation on
their own territory) and compensate the south by paying for more
environmental and development aid.
'The average North American consumes more than 36 times as much energy as
the average South Asian,' Mr Kamal Nath, India's minister for the
environment and forests, told the conference this week. 'The prudent route
to adopt is not limits on economic betterment in the already deprived
countries but rather a fundamental change in wasteful patterns of
consumption in rich countries.'
Developing nations insist that the north should transfer technology, in
particular environmentally-friendly technology, at concessional rates and
should not allow the issue of intellectual property rights to hinder the
process.
Furthermore, they want a new fund to finance programmes associated with the
Earth Summit.
The existing Global Environment Facility (GEF) managed by the World Bank
(and therefore by the north) is regarded as unacceptable for a number of
reasons; governments say they cannot undertake legally-binding commitments
if they have no control over the disposal of funds for those commitments,
while environmental pressure groups in the south complain that the World
Bank is notorious for the environmental damage caused by its programmes.
Ms Vandana Shiva of the Third World Network said this week that it was
absurd to say that 'the world's finance ministry and industry ministry can
also be the world's environment ministry'.
In most cases the industrialised countries admit that they have damaged
their own national environments in the past and that they need to curb their
output of pollutants, although they hesitate to lay themselves open to
demands for compensation by taking responsibility for global damage. They
are prepared to reform the GEF, but not to hand over billions of dollars in
cash and technology with no strings attached.
'The best way to manage technology transfer is through normal aid and
commercial channels,' said Ms Ros Kelly, the Australian minister responsible
for the environment.
She was, she said, 'surprised' by the tone of Dr Mahathir's speech, which
she thought was aimed at a Malaysian and southern hemisphere audience.
Privately, Dr Mahathir was more optimistic than he had been in the past that
the Earth Summit would be constructive, she said.
North and south may indeed still be at loggerheads, but some
environmentalists attending the conference said they were more concerned by
the fact that the developing south is imitating the north - in all its
wasteful and environmentally destructive ways - than by the fight between
the two.
That, at least, was something on which everyone could agree. 'Our policy
must be towards not following the path that many developed countries have
taken,' said Mr Delfin Ganapin, undersecretary for the environment of the
Philippines. 'That's why we don't want to accept old technology.'
Mr Nath said: 'We are not talking of how to get there. We are talking of how
not to get there. We are talking of a different path, an ecologically
sustainable path.'
Dr Mahathir Mohamad, the Malaysian prime minister, who earlier threatened to
boycott the June Earth Summit, will attend the Rio de Janeiro conference,
Kyodo reports from Kuala Lumpur.
Angered by western-led anti-tropical timber campaigns against Malaysia, Dr
Mahathir had vowed to boycott the summit if it turned out to be a forum to
'bash' tropical logging. Timber is the second biggest commodity export
earner for Malaysia.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR NAWAZ SHARIF, the Pakistani prime minister, yesterday became the first
head of a foreign government to fly into Kabul after the assumption of power
in Afghanistan by the two-day-old Islamic mujahideen government.
Shells were fired at the aircraft carrying Mr Sharif. Mr Gulbuddin
Hekmatyar, leader of the fundamentalist Hezb-i-Islam guerrilla faction, had
threatened to shoot down any aircraft from Pakistan attempting to land at
the airport.
The capture of the interior ministry removed the last Hezb stronghold in the
capital. Hezb fighters remained entrenched in three suburbs.
In full view of foreign correspondents, Uzbek militiamen allied to the new
defence minister, guerrilla leader Mr Ahmad Shah Masood, executed a
suspected Hezb fighter. The militiamen battered the man before shooting him
dead at the interior ministry.
Relative calm returned to Kabul and the battered streets filled with Afghan
shoppers who had not ventured outside during three days of fighting between
followers of the rival Islamic leaders.
Analysts still saw Hezb as a potent destabilising force. 'Most of the
population want peace but this is difficult for the fighters who can do
nothing else (but fight),' said a European diplomat. 'They are in the
capital and the smallest spark can set them off.'
Mujahideen and diplomatic officials said a Hezb leader was to be appointed
prime minister of the new government under President Sibghatullah Mojaddedi.
There was an apparent attempt to restrain the ethnic rift that Mr Hekmatyar
attempted to exploit as a Pushtoun leader, as the prime minister-designate,
Mr Ustad Fareed is - like Mr Masood - an ethnic Tajik. Mr Fareed, however,
is in Mr Hekmatyar's camp.
One diplomat said Mr Sharif's visit to Kabul - which coincided with
Islamabad's formal recognition of the new government - had kicked off a
scramble for influence in Afghanistan among its neighbours and other Islamic
nations.
Iran also recognised the interim council and said it hoped the ruling
mujahideen would respect the rights of Shias excluded from power. Turkey
pledged to 'continue to support the horourable struggle of the brotherly
Afghan people and its efforts to rebuild their country'.
Britain welcomed the transfer of power although diplomatic representation
remained to be resolved. British staff were withdrawn in February 1989
because of security fears. There is a caretaker staff in the embassy
building.
France hoped the 'very wide concensus' already enjoyed by Mr Mojaddedi 'can
extend even further'.

   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FOR ALL the chaos and confusion surrounding the choice of a successor to Mr
Hans-Dietrich Genscher as German foreign minister, there was an air of
relief yesterday at the Foreign Office in Bonn.
Senior members of the foreign service feel that the candidate they would
have most liked may well have emerged. 'Of course we were stunned like
everybody else by the minister's resignation,' said one official
diplomatically. 'That does not mean everyone admired him all the time. But
the vast majority had a lot of respect for him, not simply as the boss, but
because of his achievements.
'He was part of the system in which we worked, and it will take a while to
adapt to a machinery in which he no longer plays a part.'
When Mrs Irmgard Schwaetzer was instantly nominated for the succession by Mr
Genscher's Free Democratic Party (FDP), some doubts were expressed. She had
been a competent and hard-working deputy minister responsible for Europe.
The feeling both among politicians and diplomats was that she did not really
have the stature for the top job.
The fact that the FDP parliamentarians rebelled against their leadership,
and replaced her with Mr Klaus Kinkel, the justice minister, brings to the
job a man who understands the service from the inside, knows all the top
diplomats, and was as close as anybody to the ubiquitous Mr Genscher.
He ran Mr Genscher's private office when he was interior minister; then he
ran his private office in the Foreign Ministry; and then he became head of
the ministry's vital planning staff, before moving in 1979 to run Germany's
ailing intelligence service, the BND. 'He had the opportunity to look into
everything. He was the alter ego of Genscher at the time. And he got to know
all the people who now form the senior staff in the service, both at home
and abroad,' says a diplomat.
To that extent, they have no doubt that he will maintain his former master's
priorities: commitment to the European Community and the Atlantic alliance,
together with an energetic Ostpolitik to keep the doors open to eastern
Europe.
What he will lack is perhaps the very personal, almost physical commitment
to Ostpolitik which Mr Genscher had, thanks to his hometown of Halle in what
used to be East Germany. Mr Kinkel comes from wealthy Swabia, in the
south-west, and his instincts are inevitably more westward-looking.
He has an extremely high reputation from his career as a very political
civil servant in Bonn: for competence, coolness, and the ability to master
the most complicated brief. But he is not seen as simply a technocrat, ready
to perform the role of glorified ambassador.
Even in the Foreign Office, and then at the Justice Ministry as state
secretary, he was a very political animal, although he only joined the FDP
as a signed up member in January 1991, to become Justice Minister. He is not
even a member of parliament, but he is 'a man with a strong personality',
according to a deputy from the rival Christian Democrats.

FT  30 APR 92 / Neat deal could be an own goal for Bonn: Kohl may appear
calm in the Genscher aftermath, but has little reason to be so
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
SOME would say it was a triumph of German democracy.
A neat deal worked out in smoke-filled rooms, to ensure a smooth transition
after the sudden resignation of Mr Hans-Dietrich Genscher, the grand old man
of German foreign policy, was dramatically unpicked in five hours of stormy
debate by a group of elected parliamentarians. They ensured a popular choice
to be the new Foreign Minister, not a political one.
Others see it as an extraordinary, if all too familiar, demonstration of the
incoherence of Bonn's coalition politics, where all dirty linen is washed in
public, and Chancellor Helmut Kohl fails to provide firm leadership to keep
his partners in line.
Inevitably, there is an element of truth in both views. The departure of Mr
Genscher from his job, not only as foreign minister but as deputy
chancellor, the departure indeed of the most popular single politician in
the government, could not happen without an upheaval.
It has disturbed the fine balance of the Bonn coalition; indeed, it
threatens to shake it to its foundations. It has exposed the weakness and
lack of leadership within his own Free Democratic Party (FDP), where a new
generation is squabbling over the succession of a party which has always
enjoyed an influence far beyond its 10 per cent-odd popularity in the polls.
It has exposed the divisions, both political and personal, within the ruling
coalition, in which the FDP on one side, and the Bavarian Christian Social
Union (CSU), very Catholic and conservative, on the other, have always been
close to open warfare. It has exposed Mr Kohl's natural inclination to solve
any problems he faces through inaction, or tinkering, not through decisive
action.
Criticism of the coalition and Mr Kohl came yesterday from unlikely
quarters. Mr Martin Schell, editor-in-chief of Die Welt, the conservative
newspaper which is normally a staunch supporter of the government, wrote a
thundering piece under the headline: 'The Coalition Totters'.
He attacked the FDP and Mr Genscher for the timing of his departure. He
attacked Mr Kohl for allowing himself to be pushed around over such a key
post. He expressed sympathy for the plight of Mr Theo Waigel, finance
minister and leader of the CSU, who was so obviously side-lined from the
whole debate.
He accused Mr Genscher, the arch-manipulator of German domestic politics, of
possibly seeking to undermine the entire coalition with his resignation,
force Mr Kohl into an unwieldy 'grand coalition' with the Social Democrats,
and thus regenerate the forces of his FDP in a brief period of opposition.
The FDP certainly needs that regeneration. Mr Otto Lambsdorff, the former
economics minister, is leader only until 1994, his popularity even within
the party on the slide. He refused to quit yesterday after his own
parliamentary group rejected his nomination of Mrs Irmgard Schwaetzer as
foreign minister, in favour of Mr Klaus Kinkel, but his authority has been
terminally weakened.
Mrs Schwaetzer, Mr Kinkel, and Mr Jurgen Mollemann, the current economics
minister, have long been jostling for the succession. The FDP party leader
is the king-maker in all Bonn coalitions.
With his nomination by the party on Tuesday night to become deputy
chancellor, Mr Mollemann must be well-placed to achieve the party
leadership. Yet the jockeying continues, and the FDP leadership is committed
to continual point-scoring off its partners in the coalition.
The coalition has been undermined for months by a series of key issues on
which Mr Kohl has simply failed to negotiate a consensus. The most important
is the question of asylum-seekers.
The Christian Democrats (CDU) and the CSU want to change the constitution,
which at present allows the automatic right to demand political asylum to
anyone who asks for it. They want it limited to countries with known
political persecution.
The liberal instincts of the FDP are enraged, and the party refuses to
comply: no change in the constitution.
The second issue is how to finance the care of old people in homes: the CDU
wants to introduce a new element in social security payments to finance a
public scheme, guaranteeing places in homes where they are needed. The FDP
will not step further than a voluntary scheme that does not hit the private
sector.
On neither of those issues has any progress been made in the year or more
since the last election. There is simply a sense of drift.
Mr Kohl knows now that he still has 18 months breathing space before an
absolute spate of elections, national, regional and European, in 1994. That
is why he seems so doggedly, bloody-mindedly relaxed.
Yet hanging over his creaking coalition is the greatest challenge faced by
any country in western Europe: the challenge of unification, of somehow
bringing the collapsed society and economy of east Germany up to the level
of the west.
He may appear calm, but he has very little reason to be so. And 18 months is
a short time in politics.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BERLINERS were yesterday divided about the public sector dispute as post and
telephone services became the latest target of the strikers in Germany's
largest city.
Mr Peter Heyer said business in the furnishings shop where he worked could
be seriously affected if mail deliveries were halted for long. But, 'as an
ordinary citizen I agree with the strikers. We in the west are not being
told the truth by our politicians about the costs we still face in financing
unification'. Greengrocer Horst Nordmann said the strikes were 'perfectly
legitimate' as the government had rejected the pay claim.
Mr Werner Ascher, a lecturer at Berlin's Technical University, disagreed.
'Public service employees could have set an example for others by dispensing
with wage rises this time in order to help east Germany recover.'
Mr Jan Trautmann, a student at the university, was highly critical of the
strikers. Their actions were 'very irresponsible' as the wage claims were
far beyond what the economy could absorb.
Most west Berliners said they were only marginally affected by the selective
strike by Bundespost and Telekom workers. Civil servants took over the work
at the main postal distribution centre and three Telekom repair units.
A one-day strike which halted all public transport in west Berlin earlier in
the week was overcome by commuters switching to cars and cycles.
The strikes thus far failed to impress the Italian waiters at the Amico
restaurant in Charlottenburg district. They commented that, like almost
everything else in Germany, the strikes, planned long in advance and carried
out to the letter, were predictably dull.

FT  30 APR 92 / Markets resist the confusion

   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
IF there is any sense of crisis about this week's events in Bonn and
elsewhere, it has not communicated itself to the country's financial
markets, at least not so far.
The confusion surrounding the choice of the new foreign minister has left
markets fairly cold. Dealers said the stock market regarded it as just an
'interesting and embarrassing aside', since it did not call the stability or
durability of the coalition government into question.
The gathering strike threat is a different matter. So far, the public sector
workers' action has not really bitten hard, though the union looks as if it
is prepared for a long strike. In the engineering sector, warning strikes
have begun but industry has not really been hit. Thus the DAX index on the
Frankfurt stock exchange closed a mere 0.03 points lower at 1,734 yesterday
in moderate trading and the D-Mark closed little changed in quiet dealings
at around DM1.66 to the dollar.
But while markets have discounted the present industrial action, things
could be different if it lasts for some time. 'The stock market has been
prepared to accept these strikes, but much will depend on what happens in
the next week or so in the engineering industry,' says Mr Nigel Longley, a
Commerzbank broker. Companies, especially in the car sector, could be shut
down quickly if the big IG Metall union hits key suppliers.
So while foreign and domestic investors have reacted with sang-froid to the
first wave of strikes, their attitude could be very different if German
unions confirm the impression of fast-rising labour costs by a determination
to press for wage rises much higher than inflation. That could then give
share prices a nasty shock.

FT  30 APR 92 / French industrialists feel more confident
</HEADLINE>

   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CONFIDENCE among French industrialists is increasing, according to the
latest official figures, fuelling hopes that the economy may recover
momentum later this year.
While France's economy has not suffered to the same extent as that of other
countries, its growth rate has slowed over the past year, reflecting the
impact of high interest rates on domestic demand and the effect on exports
of recession in other countries.
Insee, the state statistics institute, yesterday confirmed that the economy
had grown by just 1.2 per cent in 1991, compared with 2.2 per cent in 1990
and 4.1 per cent in 1989.
However, the institute's survey of industrial confidence suggests that there
are already signs of improvement, particularly in export markets.
Industrialists questioned expected the overall level of demand to stabilise
over the next few months after falling since October 1990.
Confidence was strongest on the export front, where growth of 3 per cent was
predicted. The car industry and other areas of the transport sector (apart
from airlines and aerospace) were also confident of recovery in the domestic
market.
However, respondents did not expect to see an alleviation of the financial
pressures on their companies. The cost of production rose by about 0.2 per
cent in the first quarter of this year and was expected to rise again, by
0.2 to 0.4 per cent, over the next few months.

ANY loosening of Polish monetary policy this year would dash hopes of
reversing a two-year recessionary trend, the government's Central Planning
Office (CUP) warned yesterday as the government prepared for a new round of
talks with the International Monetary Fund on a suspended a Dollars 1.6bn
extended facility.
Mr Jerzy Eysymontt, responsible with Mr Andrzej Olechowski, finance
minister, for economic policy, said yesterday that positive first quarter
trends suggested the economy could bottom out to produce zero growth this
year after an 8 per cent fall in gross domestic product last year, and a 15
per cent fall in 1990.
If budgetary and other monetary targets were adhered to exports should grow
by 6 per cent and imports fall by 3 per cent to give a trade surplus of
around Dollars 500m, he added.
However, the CUP warned that if the budget deficit were allowed to exceed
the 5 per cent of GDP limit or the government bowed to union pressure for
higher wages, GDP could fall a further 5 per cent.

<TEXT>
THE French government yesterday committed itself to bring down long-term
unemployment, which now accounts for some 920,000 out of the jobless total
of 2.8m.
Meanwhile, the budget ministry indicated partial privatisations of
state-owned companies should bring in an extra FFr10bn (Pounds 1bn) which
could be channelled into the attack on unemployment. But the ministry did
not specify which companies might be earmarked.
The unemployment plan, described in yesterday's cabinet meeting by Prime
Minister Pierre Beregovoy as 'unprecedented', will ensure every long-term
unemployed person will be interviewed between now and October, and offered a
job, a training or some form of community service. The government believes
about a quarter of those unemployed for over a year have some qualification
which should help find them a job fairly quickly, while another 20-25 per
cent need extra training. Some of the least qualified could be offered
part-time community service work at a minimum wage.
Mr Georges Pebereau, president of Marceau, the French property company, has
been charged with failure to disclose adequate information to the French
stock market authorities on share dealings during his company's raid on
Societe Generale, the French bank, in 1988. Six other people have been
charged with insider dealing during the raid, including Mr Jean-Charles
Naouri, a former senior aide to Mr Pierre Beregovoy.

FT  30 APR 92 / Shake-up urged in EC car and aircraft sectors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE EUROPEAN Commission yesterday proposed improvements in research and
training programmes for the EC aircraft and motor industries as the
centrepiece of a series of suggestions for making both sectors more
competitive internationally.
The long-awaited Commission documents - launched simultaneously by Mr Martin
Bangemann, the industry commissioner - follow an examination of the state of
the two industries. The Commission has concluded that neither industry is in
crisis, but that both face big challenges over the next decade.
Companies hoping for more concrete financial support from Brussels are
likely to be disappointed with the documents, however. In line with the
broad industrial policy paper produced in December 1990, the Commission
steers clear of specific funding commitments in both sectors, and aims
instead to encourage the companies themselves to take action.
'The European automobile industry is certainly competitive, although it has
some weak points,' said Mr Bangemann yesterday. 'These can take care of
themselves if we provide the necessary accompanying measures.'
In the automotive sector, the Commission believes that EC production will
rise to 16m vehicles in the year 2000, compared with 13.7m in 1991. But at
the same time, EC manufacfrom their Japanese counterparts. The latter
achieve double the EC's productivity rates with a younger workforce,
according to the Commission, and will have full access to the European
market from the end of the century under the terms of last July's EC-Japan
agreement on imports. Aircraft manufacturers face a more varied series of
challenges, according to the Commission, including a drop in military
orders, dollar exchange rate fluctuation and fragmentation of Community
research funding.
In the motor industry, the Commission's principal suggestions include:
Improved co-operation on R&amp;D between manufacturers, including greater
emphasis, as in Japan, on exploiting the results of so-called
'pre-competitive' research.
A new emphasis on prevention rather than cure of unemployment, including
improved on-the-job and general training schemes and greater collaboration
between car-makers and training colleges to anticipate redundancies.
Encouragement for the EC's 3,200 equipment manufacturers to collaborate in
competing with Japan's more streamlined equipment sector.
In the aircraft sector, the main points include:
A suggestion that there should be 'substantial' Community support for
research and technology in the EC's 1994-98 research programme, although no
specific figure is mentioned.
Establishment of a working group to examine ways of coping with exchange
rate fluctuation, which could include a self-financed exchange rate
guarantee scheme.
Improved training, and greater co-operation with east European aircraft
manufacturers.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE CZECHOSLOVAK federal parliament has adopted a series of new tax laws
modelled on European Community practice which will broaden the tax base and
put state finances on a sounder footing.
A whole raft of new taxes - including value added tax, personal and company
income taxes, real estate taxes, inheritance and gift taxes, and environment
taxes - come into effect from January 1, 1993. They will replace the former
communist system which relied heavily on 'profits taxes' levied on
state-owned industry and turnover taxes which have proved increasingly
difficult to collect.
The tax bills presented by Mr Vaclav Klaus, federal finance minister, set
the corporate income tax rate at 45 per cent and maximum personal income tax
rate at 47 per cent.
The federal parliament also recently approved a value-added tax of 23 per
cent and a reduced, 5 per cent rate, on essential goods. The finance
minister estimated the introduction of VAT would lead to a 7 per cent rise
in prices next year while the general shift of the tax burden onto
individuals and consumers will raise living costs substantially.
Joint ventures involving foreign partners will fall under the new tax
structure from January 1, 1993, unless they have negotiated the
currently-available two-year tax holiday. Joint ventures without this tax
holiday now pay 40 per cent corporate tax instead of the 55 per cent rate
paid by local enterprises.
The parliament also adopted a law regulating the private investment funds
recently created to benefit from the country's privatisation programme. The
law aims to protect citizens who have given their vouchers entitling them to
shares of newly-privatised enterprises to such funds for management. It
stipulates that funds must diversify their assets and cannot hold more than
20 per cent of any one company.

FT  30 APR 92 / Russia and Ukraine slip toward Slav 'cold war': Tensions
over nuclear arms, the Black Sea Fleet and the Crimea
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD, JUDY DEMPSEY and CHRYSTIA FREELAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR LEONID Kravchuk, the Ukrainian President, will not be a wholly welcome
guest when he arrives in the US next week for meetings with President George
Bush. He is seen as indulging in too much brinkmanship of the most dangerous
kind in his relations with neighbouring Russia.
There is a knot of issues between the two Slav states. One part of that is
now being discussed between representatives from both in the Ukrainian port
city of Odessa - control of the Black Sea Fleet. Both states are vying for
control over this 380-ship, 70,000-man navy, now largely militarily
obsolete.
Marshal Yevgeny Shaposhnikov, the head of the Commonwealth of Independent
States armed forces, said in Odessa yesterday that the talks would be 'very
difficult' and that Ukraine should have 'at the maximum' 25 per cent of it.
Nevertheless, that was a shift in the Russian position from one of claiming
total control, and one which may make a compromise possible.
Beyond the fleet dispute, however, are larger issues, all of which have
their roots in the dissolution of the Soviet Union in which the two states
were the largest and most influential members, and in the subsequent
explosion of nationalist sentiment on both sides of their borders. That
sentiment puts such pressures on both President Kravchuk and President Boris
Yeltsin of Russia that a broader compromise is increasingly difficult.
More important than the Black Sea fleet to both states is the Crimea, where
the fleet is based. Until 1954, it was Russian territory: since then it has
been Ukrainian, but the population is mainly Russian and in two months' time
it is to vote in a referendum on the question of independence and of
subsequent association with 'another state' - presumably Russia.
Yesterday, Ukraine's parliament, in a move supported by a majority of
deputies who it seems hope to avoid a referendum, proclaimed the Crimea as
an 'autonomous part of the Ukraine'. However, almost half the 22 deputies
walked out in protest, still demanding full independence.
Most important to the international community is control of the nuclear
arsenal, both strategic and tactical.
No defence expert in Moscow or Kiev can give a precise figure of the
tactical weapons in Ukraine - but a general estimate is of at least a
thousand. Under an agreement with the CIS earlier this year, Ukraine said
that these weapons would be moved to, and dismantled in, Russia by June
1992. The reductions form part of the Intermediate Nuclear Forces Treaty
signed between Moscow and Washington in 1987.
At the beginning of March, the Kiev government stopped transferring the
weapons after about half had been moved - on the grounds that it did not
believe that Russia was dismantling them, and that Russia would use them to
increase its own arsenal.
After many bilateral meetings between Ukrainian and Russian officials, both
sides confirmed that the tactical weapons would start moving again  - though
on the Russian side, the foreign ministry has said it has 'yet to see
evidence of movement'.
Moving the 176 strategic Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles (ICBMs) is
proving still more difficult. Under the Start (Strategic Arms Reduction
Treaty) agreement signed between the US and the former Soviet Union in
Moscow in July 1991, the missile forces in the CIS must be cut from 9,700 to
4,900 by 1994. This includes 130 of the ICBMs stationed in Ukraine.
Ukraine has agreed to give up this number - but the status of the remaining
46 SS-24 ICBMs, with 10 warheads each, remains contentious.
Mr Kravchuk, in advance of his US visit, now insists on security guarantees
from the West in return for their dismantling - citing 'territorial claims'
on Ukraine from Russia as the reason for his caution.
On the Russian side, Mr Andrei Kozyrev, the foreign minister, has doubts
about Ukraine's commitment to a nuclear-free status. He and other Russian
officials argue that Ukraine wants to retain the 46 ICBMs as a means of
protecting its independence, and of securing a seat at the table where Start
II will be negotiated.
'It is clear that the (first) Start treaty was a bilateral treaty between
the US and the former USSR. Whether you like it or not, Russia . . . should
be the one which will ratify that treaty. The question for us is how many
nuclear states will emerge in the former USSR,' said Mr Kozyrev.
'At the same time, Ukraine is demanding a status as a party to (ratifying)
the Start treaty, (yet) it speaks of signing the Non-Proliferation Treaty as
a non-nuclear state. This is a contradiction in terms,' he added.
Mr Alexander Savelev, head of the independent Institute for National
Security and Strategic Studies in Moscow, said: 'The question of who should
control the nuclear arsenal is seen by the Ukraine as a matter of prestige,
compounded by a feeling that it still sees Russia as a threat to its
independence. In this sense, these 46 ICBMs could be used as a bargaining
chip.'
Meanwhile, in Moscow, conservative deputies at the recent Russian congress
tabled a motion questioning the legality of the decision by Mr Nikita
Khrushchev, a former Soviet leader (and a Ukrainian), to transfer the Crimea
from Russia to the Ukraine in 1954.
But the last thing Russian government officials and defence experts in
Moscow want is any re-drawing of the internal borders of the former Soviet
Union.
'Borders should not be changed in this period of transition. It is too
dangerous. Where would it stop? The problem is the influence of nationalist
forces in Russia who could push for these territorial changes,' said Mr
Alexei Pankin, deputy editor of International Affairs, the Moscow-based
foreign policy journal.
The next few weeks should tell if compromises on the fleet, on Crimea and on
possession of the weapons are possible: realistically, that is all the time
both states have to broker a deal.
Beyond that, the pressures from nationalist forces, rising faster the more
pronounced their economic crises become, will drown out moderate voices and
force a retreat into armed camps to a position now becoming all too
thinkable: a 'cold war' between the Slav neighbours.

WESTERN Germany's public service unions yesterday stepped up their pressure

the public.
As about 130,000 private sector engineering workers began token protest
stoppages in the south, rubbish collectors struck for the first time and
local transport strikes spread to Hesse, home to Frankfurt, the national
financial centre.
There were no signs of a break in the deadlock, blamed on the employers'
refusal to increase their 4.8 per cent pay offer, although some easing of
the disruption is likely today as the country winds down for the long May
Day weekend.
During a cursory cabinet discussion yesterday, Chancellor Helmut Kohl
reminded colleagues of the importance of sending the correct signals to the
private sector by keeping public service pay under control, and won
agreement for a two-year freeze on ministerial pay.
According to the oTV union, main orchestrator of the public sector strike,
215,000 people took part in stoppages yesterday, up from 75,000 on Monday
and 175,000 on Tuesday.
However, according to Mr Willi Muck, oTV deputy president, action would be
reduced today 'from Wednesday's peak'. Disruption of local transport would
be limited to specific areas, including the industrial and financial centres
of North-Rhine Westphalia and Hesse.
So far, the strike, largely limited to local transport and postal services,
has failed to generate the widely forecast chaos.
Unions have been meticulous in avoiding sensitive areas. 'Striking' hospital
doctors have merely refused to do official form-filling. The oTV stressed
that payment of state pensions would not be hampered.
However, with local transport stoppages expected to well up again next week,
the impact on business could increase. City centre retail sales have already
fallen by up to 20 per cent a day.

INTERNATIONAL mail services to and from Ireland face prolonged disruption
because of a dispute over casual labour at An Post, Ireland's postal
services company.
The state-run company yesterday suspended more than 300 staff after they
refused to work with 180 part-time and casual employees brought into
Dublin's central sorting office.
An Post yesterday warned the public not to post letters in Dublin until
further notice.
The dispute began over the implementation of measures designed to reduce An
Post's projected IPounds 3.6m (Pounds 3.27m) loss this year.
These include employing casual labour to reduce overtime bills, the ending
of a 1987 productivity agreement and the transfer of staff to new offices.
The measures have been recommended by an independent tribunal.
Mr David Begg, the general secretary of the Communications Workers Union,
said: 'We are very worried about An Post's intentions.
'We would be very happy to have full-time permanent staff recruited but
since we cannot get the facts about the proposed casual and part-time
recruits we have to be concerned that the intention is to casualise the Post
Office as an employment,' he said.
The union is ballotting its members on the tribunal's recommendations.

FT  29 APR 92 / Arts: The audience bites back - Television
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Serving regularly as the guest on Pete Murray's phone-in programme on
London's LBC Talkback Radio to discuss the week's television is both an
informative and sobering experience. As the voices of the public come and go
in your headphones you realise what an extraordinary role television plays
as companion and comforter in the lives of so many people today, and how
strongly attached people become to their favourite programmes, especially
soap operas such as Coronation Street and Neighbours. The fabled types who
really believe in the characters, to the extent of sending flowers for
fictional weddings, never seem to phone, yet passions are certainly aroused.
Last week a whole succession of callers protested bitterly about a scene in
EastEnders where a character made sandwiches for Passover out of white
sliced bread, butter and cold lamb. Clearly the anger was caused not by
damage to the credibility of the character, but by what was seen as the
ignorance of the producers.
For a professional critic perhaps the most interesting revelation is the way
in which so many viewers seem to combine a dedication to the programmes with
a deep contempt for the programme makers. This applies not only to soap
operas or game shows, but all the way up and down the scale of subject
matter and seriousness. So called 'ordinary members of the public' are
willing  - indeed keen  - to be far more scathing than any paid critic would
normally expect to be. Last week I expressed reservations about three new
programmes, all from the BBC as it happens, all involving mystery or
detection: Resnick, Thacker and Mr Wakefield's Crusade. Among the words I
used were 'mannered' and 'contrived'. The next caller was almost speechless
with scorn. 'Mannered?' he screeched, 'Contrived? All those programmes were
absolute crap]'
On such occasions the professional critic may find himself defending that
which he previously attacked. Were there no saving graces? In Resnick,
leaving aside script and acting for a moment, didn't the perpetual rain, the
brownish light, and the deliberately odd camera angles at least add up to a
recognisably different visual style? And at a time when the sheer quantity
of television was making it difficult for any individual programme to remain
memorable, wasn't that an achievement of sorts? No. It was all pretentious
claptrap. What was more the caller was fed to the back teeth with dramas in
which key passages of dialogue were rendered inaudible by other noises. On
this point we all (Pete Murray, guest, and caller) agreed: none of us was
hard of hearing, yet all spent our time in front of the set these days
asking companions 'What did he say?' and getting the response 'Don't know.
Couldn't hear'. The culprits are directors and producers who, knowing the
script by heart, allow actors to mumble and, during the dubbing of sound
effects and music, don't even notice that the crunching gravel or the
quivering violins are obliterating the line which was meant to reveal the
identity of the murderer or the motive.
But absolute crap? Certainly the incidence of studied idiosyncracy in
television mysteries has become tiresome. In Thacker everyone in sight was
slightly barmy, from Graham Crowden's character who collected giant insects,
to the yokels who were hunting for an ancient afterbirth. (Incidentally the
theme of rustic malevolence and the intruding stranger has frequently been
done better, most memorably in John Bowen's 1970 BBC drama Robin Redbreast).
If possible Mr Wakefield's Crusade seems even more determinedly dotty. Here
we have a millionaire whose only pastime is buying stamps at the Post
Office, where a fellow customer dies at his feet. Wakefield steals a letter
from the corpse and begins a murder hunt . . . maybe. Certainly there is
much in these productions to irritate.
Yet it is surely a little ungrateful to condemn everything which happens to
be somewhat out of the ordinary. In Thacker, which looked like a pilot for a
series, it was good to find Leslie Phillips continuing his late career
break, away from silly-ass clubmen and satisfying, too, to find that his
character  - the Humber driving ex-colonial  - was, unpredictably, the one
dishing out the violence when necessary. In my book Mr Wakefield's Crusade
wins points for the presence of Richard Griffiths as an interfering porter
in a block of mansion flats, for the absence of steam trains and Fair Isle
pullovers, and for the BBC's usual high production values. Television
viewing would surely be far worse if, as the expansion of the medium
continued, the programme makers simply produced more and more of the same
tried and tested stuff  - and we would have far more reason to complain.
That said, it is worth pondering why there seems to be more experimentation,
and consequently more contempt from the phone-in callers, in drama than
elsewhere. Newish ideas are sometimes tried in comedy: in the last few years
there has been a trend towards simple studio shows which need neither
costumes nor sets, series such as Whose Line Is It Anyway? and Have I Got
News For You. These appear to be the equivalent, for the younger generation,
of the series previously done by stand-up comedians. Yet the old conventions
carry on: Harry Enfield's Television Programme is similar to the shows once
done by Harry Worth and Dick Emery, though Enfield may yet prove superior to
both. And of course the half hour sitcom, God save the mark, continues to
come at us. BBC1's Don't Tell Father which started on Sunday evening is
another series about snobbery and English class consciousness which could
have been made any year since about 1962. Or 1862. Side By Side which began
on BBC1 on Monday is yet another.
It is hard to avoid the conclusion that the essential difference is between
fiction and non-fiction, and that there is much less need felt among
programme makers to strain for novelty in current affairs or documentary
programmes than in drama or comedy. Even here, of course, fashion does play
a part and sometimes a powerful and annoying one. For instance the trend is
once again swinging in favour of 'verite' documentaries. Producers seem to
think that in abandoning reporter, voice-over, graphics and so on they are
being non-manipulative, but viewers tend to feel that they have been left in
the dark to work things out for themselves. Last week's True Stories on
Channel 4 about a small psychiatric hospital called The Cassel, though good
in some ways, occasionally left you wondering whether the person speaking
was a doctor, a nurse or a patient.
However, with most factual programmes the producers know that if the story
they have to tell is powerful enough, few of us will even notice the style
being used. Jonathan Lewis's Assignment about the atrocities committed by
the Japanese during the Second World War, for example, was stylistically
unremarkable but quite impossible to forget.
What it comes down to in the end is the difference between a piece of work
which is entirely the invention of the programme makers and one which is
not. Judging from the people who phone Pete Murray's show, most viewers are
keenly aware of this difference, sub-consciously at least, which is
presumably why they are so ready to dismiss television drama but rarely
television journalism as absolute crap.

The younger comedians in the wake of the generation which seems to be
rapidly passing away (Eric Morecambe, Tommy Cooper, Frankie Howerd, Benny
Hill) appear to be obsessed by boredom. Paul Morley begins a new run of his
half-hour series The Thing Is .. with 'Boredom' (8.30 C4). He talks about
boredom to Claire Rayner (there is a programme somewhere this week without
Claire Rayner in it), Peter Cook, and Thora Hird. Then we are told that in
Sean's Show Sean Hughes' best friend writes a book 'exposing Sean's
incredibly boring life' (10.30 C4). Could it be that these young men suspect
that, compared to their predecessors, they really are boring? Could they be
right? BBC2's series The Buried Mirror about 'Spain and the new world',
written and presented by Carlos Fuentes, began with a competent, uninspiring
history of Spain. Today's episode compares Aztec customs and religion with
the Christian variety of the Conquistadores. The BBC describes Mr
Wakefield's Crusade as 'darkly comic'. Others might call it obscurely weird.
Peter Capaldi plays the rich amateur sleuth (9.40 BBC2).

FT  29 APR 92 / DPP chief suggests safeguards for companies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD EVANS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COMPANIES should separate the functions of chairman and chief executive as a
safeguard against malpractice, Mrs Barbara Mills, the new director of public
prosecutions, said yesterday.
She suggested that companies appoint audit, remuneration and nomination
committees, ensure no individual is sole signatory to a company bank
account, and introduce effective non-executive directors.
Mrs Mills said: 'All of these measures are safeguards which can protect an
organisation against the over-powerful individual who may ruin a company,
but they will not inhibit the talents, drive and energy of successful
directors.'
Mrs Mills, until recently director of the Serious Fraud Office, said that in
common with best practice in the private sector, the public sector needed a
clear corporate philosophy to improve its performance.
Low ethical standards would bring individuals, organisations and entire
markets into disrepute. Those who used undesirable business practices might
believe they were gaining an advantage over more honest competitors, but
this was bound to be short-term.
'There is no better a recommendation than a reputation for honesty and
integrity,' she said. 'Low ethics will infect an entire market or
profession, and it is just a short step from that to committing criminal
offences.'

FT  29 APR 92 / London Stock Exchange: Market falters after sell programme
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE much-heralded Lloyds Bank move against Midland Bank duly appeared first
thing yesterday, but had only a marginal effect on an equity market showing
signs of running out of steam after its recent strong performance.
The FT-SE 100-share Index, although closing well above the day's lowest
level, was 7.2 down at 2,651.
Lloyds' statement that it intended to launch a hostile bid for Midland - at
a price considerably above that offered three weeks ago by Hongkong and
Shanghai Banking  - triggered a burst of excitement that drove Midland, as
well as the market, up at the outset.
The market, however, pounced on a number of pre-conditions in the Lloyds
statement of intent and shares quickly moved into reverse. Midland, marked
up to 396p after the bid news was made public, closed below that level.
Early optimism that the Midland news could launch the Footsie towards a
record high was dashed, partly by second thoughts on the latest developments
in the takeover saga. Dealers also mentioned general profit-taking, the near
20-point overnight decline on Wall Street, and a rapid slide in the Footsie
future shortly after trading commenced.
From an opening level of 2,659.5, up 1.3, the Footsie quickly retreated to
what proved to be the day's low of 2,635.6, down 22.6, at mid-morning,
additionally weakened by a medium-sized sell programme, said to have been
executed by one of the US broking houses as part of a Europe-wide selling
operation. The programme was thought to have comprised a large number of
second-line stocks, which can often prove difficult to place.
Thereafter, the market stabilised and began to claw its way back, with
buyers gradually moving in as the session drew to a close, prompted by a
moderately encouraging CBI survey of business confidence. Wall Street failed
to provide any real support for London, opening lower, staging a modest
recovery and then moving down again.
Dealers said there had been an element of nervousness ahead of today's
biggest-ever gilts auction of Pounds 2.5bn worth of stock. Sterling turned
off late in the session, closing easier against the dollar and unchanged
against the D-Mark.
Recent strong takeover speculation in other areas, notably in Tarmac and
Pilkington, tended to die down, while there were again hints of heavy
fund-raising via rights issues.
Oil shares were very much in the limelight, with US buyers still chasing BP
higher and vague takeover stories and hints of imminent asset sales boosting
Lasmo, one of the market's best performers in recent days. Profit downgrades
took their toll on British Gas, however. Old hands in the oil sector also
recalled a failed market raid by Gas on Lasmo in the late 1980s. Property
shares tumbled in the early part of the day but staged a late recovery.
Turnover in equities rose to 604.7m shares from Monday's 518.4m, but there
was disappointment with news that the value of business on Monday dipped
below the Pounds 1bn level for only the second time since the general
election.

FT  29 APR 92 / London Stock Exchange: Property revival quashed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO, PETER JOHN, COLIN MILLHAM and CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FRAGILE recovery in the property sector was brought to an abrupt halt
yesterday as investors rushed to sell stock following a pessimistic
breakfast meeting hosted by Savills, a leading property consultancy.
The meeting, attended by fund managers, analysts, receivers and bankers,
heard Savills quash any talk of a short-term property revival and forecast
continued weakness in the rental sector until the end of 1994. The meeting
coincided with equally bearish analysis by the Investment Property Databank
and a gloomy report from County NatWest, the latter suggesting that a
secondary market and debt securitisation may be needed to inject liquidity
to lift the sector from its malaise.
A late rally limited most damage to those stocks with a large exposure to
the central London office market. Great Portland Estates lost 5 to 154p,
while Land Securities, off 12 at one stage, rallied to end 3 down at 428p.
MEPC also found late support to finish 4 off at 339p after good volume of
2.3m.
Midland climbs
The well flagged counter-bid interest in Midland Bank came through yesterday
and the shares responded accordingly. They were marked up 15p at the start
of trading and were then bought up to 400p, a five-year high.
Later, Midland shares drifted as speculators who had bought stock when it
was sold as part of the Kuwait Investment Office's recent 60m-share placing
decided to take profits. Midland closed 13 ahead at 394p with more than 27m
shares traded.
Lloyds Bank, which announced it was interested in bidding at 457p a share,
was marked down 14p at the outset. Now that Lloyds has declared itself, the
potential uncertainty of a Monopolies and Mergers Commission inquiry hangs
over the bank. The shares ended a net 10 off at 417p.
Gas downgrade
Concern that the mild winter would impact on forthcoming first-quarter
results from British Gas lay behind a sharp fall in the share price. Gas,
which is a highly liquid stock and rarely moves by more than a few pence in
any one day, closed 7 1/2 down at 262p with 11m shares traded.
Analysts were said to be cutting their forecasts for the figures, due on May
14, by Pounds 50m to around Pounds 650m. Mr Keith Morris of Carr Kitcat &amp;
Aitken said: 'Gas makes about 50 per cent of its money in the first quarter
and this is likely to impact on full-year figures.' Mr Morris reduced his
own full-year forecast by Pounds 75m to Pounds 1.225bn and his dividend
estimate to 14.25p from 15p.
The revived interest in oil shares continued. Some traders attributed it
purely to US investors but others said that even UK customers were beginning
to feel that the selling might have been too savage. BP, which has been the
hardest hit, rose 7 1/2 to 263 1/2 p on heavy turnover of 23m shares,
building on Monday's gain. Shell picked up 3 to 474p.
Outside the majors, Lasmo, believed to be about to announce the prospective
bidders for its Wilmington refinery, rose 11 to 239p. Enterprise improved 7
to 420p.
FKI moved ahead 4 to 78p on high turnover of 12m after SG Warburg reiterated
a buy recommendation on the stock and following a favourable presentation to
City analysts by managing director Mr Bob Beeston, who joined the company in
January.
Yesterday it was the turn of investors to be addressed by the new man at
FKI, at the company's broker Panmure Gordon. Warburg said: 'Mr Bob Beeston
is a professional operator with the right credentials to improve FKI's
profitability.'
French cement maker Cement Francais became the latest rumoured target for
Hanson, with talk that the conglomerate was interested in agreeing to take a
controlling stake in the company. However, institutional buyers reported
that Paribas, Cement Francais' owner, was offering stock to institutions,
making an agreed bid seem unlikely. Hanson finished a penny off at 234 1/2
p.
Wellcome, buoyed by a press report that it could be seeking a US listing for
its shares, recovered 14 to 1029p.
British Aerospace lost 6 to 349p after Henderson Crosthwaite cut its current
year profits forecast by Pounds 40m to Pounds 160m. Rolls-Royce put on 3 to
172p on turnover of 3.7m ahead of an analysts' visit to the NEI plant which
begins tomorrow.
After Monday's hectic activity, hotel issues were largely friendless. Forte
tumbled 7 to 255p in spite of a large institutional presentation at Paribas
and a consequent buy note from the French-owned broking house.
Rank Organisation, which rose on Monday after announcing the disposal of its
main UK hotels, receded 12 to 727p as investors reflected on less than
enthusiastic press and broker comment. A 1.3m line of shares in holiday
group Owners Abroad was placed at 103p. The stock lost  1/2 to 104 1/2 p.
Food group Dalgety advanced 12 to 418p, although market observers tended to
play down suggestions of a possible takeover offer.
Turnover in Asda remained very high, totalling 20m shares after 17m on
Monday and similar volumes on Thursday and Friday of last week. Profits
downgrades continued to burden the shares, which dipped a penny to 26 1/2 p.
Questioning of supermarket chains' property valuation and accounting
policies by Mr Tony Shiret, analyst at Credit Lyonnais Laing, tended to
depress the sector.

FT  29 APR 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Economic data leave Dow
little changed

Wall Street
A VARIETY of economic reports had little effect on US stock markets
yesterday as investors concentrated on equity valuations and quarterly
results, writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average was finally just 3.36 up at 3,307.92,
although after showing a midsession decline of 10 points. The Standard &amp;
Poor's 500 finished 0.66 ahead at 409.11, but the Nasdaq composite index
continued its slide, losing 6.61 at 560.33. Turnover on the New York SE came
to 189m shares, while falls led rises by 959 to 715.
Two sets of data provided fresh evidence of economic recovery. Gross
domestic product in the first quarter rose 2 per cent, in line with
expectations, although the details on personal consumption within the GDP
numbers showed spending had risen much further than analysts had forecast
during the first three months of the year.
The Conference Board's consumer confidence index showed a big rise to 64.8
per cent in April, but providing negative news was a larger than expected
14.8 per cent drop in March new home sales, undermining hopes of a housing
market rebound.
In spite of the weight of positive economic data, some analysts were
concerned that the stock market had risen too high during the recent rally.
First-quarter corporate earnings continued to come in. General Motors put on
Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 40 1/4 after reporting quarterly net income of
Dollars 179m, against a loss of Dollars 144m at the same stage a year ago.
The car maker's revenues in the quarter were up slightly to Dollars 32bn.
GM's figures helped the other car stocks, Chrysler adding Dollars  3/8 at
Dollars 19 and Ford Dollars  3/8 at Dollars 43 3/4 .
RJR Nabisco firmed Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 9 7/8 in active trading after the
tobacco and foods group announced a first-quarter loss of Dollars 15m, after
a charge for the early repayment of debt. Without the charge, RJR's
operating profit was Dollars 144m.
Pepsico rose Dollars 1 to Dollars 34 3/4 on news of first-quarter profits of
30 cents a share, up from 26 cents a year ago. Whirlpool fell Dollars 2 5/8
to Dollars 42 7/8 in spite of reporting first-quarter profits of 50 cents a
share, up from 35 cents in the first quarter of 1991.
Coleman advanced Dollars 1 7/8 to Dollars 26 1/2 in the wake of a big
improvement in first-quarter earnings, and a forecast from the company that
second-quarter profits should come in substantially higher than at the same
stage a year ago.
On the Nasdaq market, Microsoft fell Dollars 4 1/4 to Dollars 109 after the
company said it was 'comfortable' with analysts' estimates that it would
make between Dollars 1 and Dollars 1.05 a share in the fiscal fourth
quarter.
Borland International bounced back from Monday's selling that was spurred by
news of a quarterly loss. It recovered Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 46.
Canada
BANK SHARES led a late rally in Toronto blue chips, leaving the TSE
composite index at the session's high. The broad market closed on a softer
note, with merchandising, gold and consumer products issues slightly lower.
Trade was slow due to investor caution ahead of the Ontario provincial
Budget, due out late tomorrow.
The composite index closed 11.5 ahead at 3,337.9. Declines outnumbered
advances by 297 to 253 after volume of 24.6m shares valued at CDollars 253m.
Nova shares began flooding the secondary market after the company closed its
public offering yesterday of 42m shares to raise CDollars 302m. The stock
rose CDollars  1/4 to CDollars 8 1/8 on volume of 2.8m shares.

FT  29 APR 92 / Money Markets: Rate cut ruled out
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
IN SPITE of sterling's strong position against the D-Mark, the domestic
money markets continued to ignore all suggestions of a reduction in British
interest rates.
Instead, dealers kept Germany's political and economic difficulties at the
forefront of their minds, believing that a lowering of rates there is a
far-off prospect. A confident prediction by Mr John Major, the prime
minister, that the British economy was on the road to recovery also dampened
speculation of a rate cut. One analyst suggested yesterday that the comments
implied that the government saw no need to stimulate a recovery at the
moment.
As a result, rates in the interbank market ended mostly unchanged. The
3-month interbank rate, an important indicator of future base rate, ended at
around 10 17/32 - 1/2 per cent, roughly the same as Monday's close of 10 1/2
 -3/8. One-year money ended the day slightly cheaper at 10 5/16 - 3/16 per
cent, after a Monday close of 10 3/8 - 1/4 per cent.
Short sterling futures finished the day at figures mostly consistent with 10
1/2 per cent base rates. After a day of trading in an 11-tick range, the
June short sterling contract closed at around 89.74, having finished on
Monday at 89.79. This suggests that the market believes that base rates
three months from now will be at 10.26 per cent.
There was no hint in the discount market that rates were about to fall.
Again, the Bank of England forecast a large shortage of around Pounds 950m.
It later purchased Pounds 566m of bills, of which Pounds 10m were of Band-1
bank bills at 10 3/8 per cent, and Pounds 6m were at the same rates in
Band-2. In addition, Pounds 550m went into repurchase agreements to mature
in equal amounts on May 11 and 12 at an interest rate of 10 7/16 per cent.
The forecast was revised to a shortage of around Pounds 1bn before taking
account of the early operations. The Bank purchased bills worth Pounds 77m,
of which Pounds 27m were Band-2 bank bills at 10 3/8 per cent and Pounds 50m
were for resale to the market in equal amounts on May 11 and 12 at an
interest rate of 10 7/16 per cent. In the afternoon, the Bank purchased
Pounds 24m of Band-2 bank bills at 10 3/8 per cent. It provided late
assistance of Pounds 305m.
German call money was quoted at 9.655 per cent after the Bundesbank injected
emergency short-term funds into the market.

FT  29 APR 92 / Foreign Exchanges: US indicators weaken dollar
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DOLLAR had a day of mixed fortunes on foreign exchange markets yesterday
after an uncertain set of indicators checked an initial surge of popularity
in the US currency, writes James Blitz.
Traders had been hoping that the figures would fuel renewed confidence in
the dollar after several days of uncertain trading. In the end, the broad
range of indicators proved so wildly contradictory that the market was left
in an aimless mood over how to respond to them.
Two of them were clearly positive. The important April consumer confidence
measure, issued by the Conference Board, a US business group, leapt to 64.8
against forecasts of 55.1. The figure for first-quarter GDP matched market
predictions, rising a solid 2 per cent after a modest 0.4 per cent increase
in the fourth quarter of last year.
Analysts, however, said these results had already been factored into dollar
trading. And figures for March new home sales, which plunged 14.8 per cent,
had a depressing effect on the market. As a result, early interest in the US
currency, which at midsession in London was trading at DM1.6600, was checked
in the afternoon. It ended at DM1.6555. In London trading the dollar managed
to reverse a slight slide against the yen, finishing at Y133.25 after a
previous close of Y133.10.
In New York trading, the uncertain economic indicators were also a dampening
influence on the dollar. After opening more firmly against both the D-Mark
and yen, the US currency later slipped to close at DM1.6536 and Y133.15.
The D-Mark had a mostly uneventful day after the punishment it took in
trading on Monday. The German currency is suffering in the wake of Germany's
worst industrial unrest for 18 years, and two surprising resignations from
the Bonn cabinet at the start of the week. Dealers said it had recovered
some of its poise by the end of trading in Europe yesterday. In London, it
resisted a renewed attack from sterling to end at DM2.9375, the same as its
previous close.
The other important action of the day in European markets centred on the
Swiss franc, which extended yesterday's late rally on newspaper reports that
it might bid for European Community membership.
'The world, its wife, their children and the dog were short of Swiss
francs,' said one US bank trader cynically, 'and they used the rehashed EC
story as a good excuse to take profits.' The Swiss franc ended the day 1.32
centimes stronger against the dollar at SFr1.5158, from SFr1.5290. It closed
in New York at SFr1.5160.
Although it remained strong, sterling failed to fully break through the
DM2.94 barrier in London trading, as profit-takers took their gains after
the pound's successes on Monday.

FT  29 APR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Zimbabwe counts cost of drought
 -Farm output is set to slump to a 30-year low
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY HAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As the summer draws to its close, Zimbabwe's farmers are counting the cost
of what for most of them is the worst drought they have ever experienced.
Over the country as a whole, rainfall has been less than half the seasonal
average; in many southern and eastern areas, it has been between a tenth and
a third of normal levels.
Crop production has been devastated, with the exception of drought-resistant
tobacco, where output has risen 6 per cent to 180m kg. Maize deliveries to
the state-owned grain marketing board will fall by 90 per cent this year to
60,000 tonnes, from more than 600,000 tonnes last year and an annual average
of more than 1m tonnes in the late 1980s.
Cotton deliveries are forecast at less than 90,000 tonnes, down from 205,000
tonnes in 1991, soyabeans at 30,000 tonnes (133,000 tonnes last year), while
winter wheat production is expected to fall to less than a third of normal
levels. In the low veld, where rains have been below normal since 1989,
sugar production has come to a halt, turning Zimbabwe from a substantial
exporter into a net importer.
At ZDollars 3.7bn (Pounds 410m) last year, agriculture accounted for almost
20 per cent of gross domestic product, though in real terms, it was 8 per
cent below the mid-1980s peak. Flue-cured tobacco accounts for just over
half of this, and while there is likely to be some modest growth in the
value of its output this year, the rest, with the exceptions of beef and
horticulture will fall catastrophically; so much so that, in real terms,
farm output in 1992 is projected to slump to its lowest levels for 30 years.
The impact on the economy will be devastating. Growth is forecast to decline
from 3.6 per cent last year to between minus 4 and minus 5 per cent in 1992.
Following last year's 45 per cent devaluation of the Zimbabwean dollar,
exports of farm produce in US dollar terms will be sharply lower, with
tobacco earnings of less than USDollars 500m, compared with Dollars 520m in
1991 (28 per cent of total exports). The collapse of sugar, cotton, and
maize exports and reduced foreign earnings from coffee and tea will cost the
country at least Dollars 150m (10 per cent of exports) over the next 12
months.
At the same time, the country will need to import at least Dollars 350m
worth of maize, wheat, sugar and possibly, later in the year, dairy
products.
After allowing for some reduction in other imports and higher exports of
manufactures and some minerals, the balance of payments impact will exceed
Dollars 300m  - at the very least  - pushing the current account deficit
above Dollars 1bn, or 20 per cent of GDP.
Financing this will be difficult given similar emergency food aid demands in
the region from Angola, Malawi, Mozambique and Zambia. The traditional
suppliers of maize to these countries  - South Africa and Zimbabwe  - will
be importing up to 7m tonnes themselves this year (5m tonnes for South
Africa and 2m tonnes for Zimbabwe).
Compensatory funding will be available from the International Monetary Fund,
but when this and other aid commitments are taken into account there is
certain to be an unfilled gap in the region, which for Zimbabwe will mean
diverting other aid funds and export earnings to pay for food.
Transport poses an even more formidable challenge than financing. The entire
southern African region will need an estimated 10m tonnes of food imports
this year. Zimbabwe's needs are put at about 2m tonnes of maize and 500,000
tonnes of wheat, sugar and other products, while Malawi will need at least
1m tonnes and Zambia more than 800,000 tonnes. The port of Beira in
Mozambique is expected to handle a minimum of 600,000 tonnes of this
traffic, while the Zambians expect to bring in some of their requirements
from the Tanzanian port of Dar es Salaam.
But the main burden will fall on South Africa, which has dedicated the ports
of Cape Town, Port Elizabeth and East London to regional food imports.
Initially, Spoornet, the South African railways, will run two liner trains
daily, each carrying 700 tonnes of food, though the frequency will increase
later. Zimbabwe's authorities will have to grapple with the problems either
of running the trains through to the main distribution centres, such as
Harare and Bulawayo, or transferring the maize to the Zimbabwe rail and road
systems at the Beit Bridge border.
While transport industry officials expect Spoornet to cope, there are doubts
as to the capacity of the regional systems in Malawi, Mozambique, Zambia
and, to a lesser degree, Zimbabwe.
In addition to its direct impact on agriculture, the drought will have
far-reaching consequences for the Zimbabwean economy. The reduced water flow
through the Kafue Gorge in neighbouring Zambia has forced Lusaka to suspend
electricity exports to Zimbabwe, which next month will impose a 20 per cent
electric power cut. This will have serious repercussions on mining and
manufacturing, with mining sources warning that output and exports could
fall by as a much as a fifth.
Some mines are also in difficulty because of the water situation, while
mineral exports could be jeopardised by transport congestion.
The country's textile and clothing industry  - the main exporter of
manufactured goods  - has warned of production cutbacks and lay-offs unless
it is allowed to import cotton this year. The banks, already under pressure
to contain lending as part of the government's on-off credit squeeze, will
be forced to carry farmers' overdrafts through until the 1993 harvest. Next
year's crop and livestock production will remain below average  - even if
good rains fall  - as early plantings will be reduced because of a lack of
irrigation. After a drought-induced surge this year caused by destocking,
beef production will fall sharply as cattlemen rebuild their herds. The
dairy sector, like maize, was in crisis before the drought, because of the
government's producer price policy, which has pushed farmers into export
crops (such as tobacco), horticulture and even game farming.
At best, it will take the industry until 1994-95 to regain average
production levels of the late 1980s, while the economy as a whole is
unlikely to recover fully from the drought of 1992 for at least two years.

<TEXT>
COFFEE and COCOA prices fell to the lowest levels since the early 1970s at
the London Futures and Options Exchange in early trading, but both rallied
towards the close to end with relatively moderate losses on the day. The
July position on the cocoa market slipped to a fresh 16 1/2 -year low of
Pounds 587 a tonne as selling by the Ivory Coast, the biggest producer,
found buying interest extremely thin. But buyers emerged eventually,
although one trader described this as 'just a bit of bargain-hunting', and
the July price recovered to Pounds 598 a tonne, down Pounds 5 on the day.
The coffee market fared even worse early on, the July contract dipping to a
20-year low of Dollars 760 a tonne. Dealers suggested that extra pressure
was being put on coffee prices by producers being forced to sell quickly to
pay off debts: 'No one can afford to hold coffee at origin so everything is
coming straight out,' analyst Mr Peter Kettle of ED and F. Man (Coffee)
explained. The late rally started after the New York market opened firmer
than expected and by the close the July price had moved up to Dollars 765 a
tonne, down Dollars 4 on the day.

FT  29 APR 92 / Government Bonds: Gilts slip as investors take positions for
auction
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
UK government bond prices moved slightly lower yesterday as investors took
positions ahead of today's Pounds 2.5bn gilts auction, the first test of
demand for government paper since the Conservative election victory.
Yesterday, the 9 per cent gilt maturing 2011 closed at 99 25/32 , down 1/16
of a point on the day, for a yield of 9.02 per cent. The June gilt futures
contract on Liffe closed at 98.22, from an opening level of 98.26 and 98.28
on Monday. Volume was 34,000 contracts.
Today's auction of 8 3/4 per cent bonds maturing 2017 is expected to attract
demand primarily from UK institutional investors. However, the bonds are tax
exempt for overseas residents, a feature designed to attract overseas
investment institutions which normally shun long-dated issues.
Analysts said yesterday that total bids for stock would have to cover bonds
available y at least twice for the auction to be judged a success.
GERMAN government bond prices were weaker yesterday following Monday's
strong technical rally, with no new factors to push the market forward.
The benchmark 8 per cent Unity bond maturing 2002 closed at 100.08, little
changed from 100.12 at the opening, for a yield of 7.98 per cent.
The June bund futures contract on Liffe, the London exchange, closed at
87.35 from an opening level of 87.39 and 87.44 on Monday. During the morning
session, the contract hit a low of 87.16 before recovering ground through
the afternoon.
With no new regional inflation data released yesterday, the market focused
on the second day of industrial action.
US Treasury prices rose at the long end of the maturity range yesterday
morning after traders and investors took heart from an unexpectedly sharp
fall in March new home sales.
In late trading the benchmark 30-year government issue was up  19/32 at 99
5/16 , yielding 8.052 per cent. The two-year note was up  3/32 at 99 31/32 ,
yielding 5.375 per cent.
Prices fell in early trading, a knee-jerk reaction to news of a 2 per cent
increase in first-quarter gross domestic product. The improvement in GDP was
in line with market forecasts, and confirmed that the US economy had pulled
out of recession. The GDP data also showed that personal consumption rose
5.3 per cent in the first three months of the year, a bigger-than-expected
rise and the main reason for the early fall in Treasury prices.
The market recovered at the long end, however, when the Commerce Department
reported that new home sales fell by 14.8 per cent in March, a fall that was
much bigger than analysts had expected. The news buoyed investors, because
it suggested that the recovery in the housing market may have stalled last
month, and overshadowed the Conference Board's announcement of a rise in its
consumer confidence index from 56.5 per cent last month to 64.8 per cent in
April.
JAPANESE government bond prices slipped overnight in Tokyo in thin trading,
ahead of a public holiday today.
The benchmark 10-year government bond issue No 129 closed the Tokyo day on a
yield of 5.685 per cent, from 5.665 on Monday and 5.5.625 per cent on
Friday.

63m for quarter

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
USAir Group, the parent company of America's sixth-largest carrier, remained
firmly in the red during the first three months of 1992. Its losses,
however, were significantly reduced from the same period a year ago.
The after-tax deficit amounted to Dollars 63m. This contrasted with the
large Dollars 168.7m loss in the first three months of 1991, when the Gulf
war sent traffic levels tumbling.
Among the other US carriers, American has made a small profit and Delta -
still coping with the aftermath of the acquisition of former Pan Am assets
 -a significant loss.
USAir continues to suffer from a large interest burden; net interest charges
totalled Dollars 59m, against Dollars 60.5m a year ago. At the operating
level it continued to make losses, scoring a Dollars 24.3m deficit, down
from Dollars 161.4m in the first quarter of 1991. Total operating revenues
were Dollars 1.65bn, against Dollars 1.58bn. On the cost side, USAir was
helped by a fall in fuel expenses, from Dollars 233.6m to Dollars 173.5m. Mr
Seth Schofield, chief executive, said 1992 would probably be 'another very
difficult year for the airline industry'.
He said the industry still had substantial overcapacity, and that 'recent
industry-wide fare reductions will have an adverse impact on revenue, the
extent and duration of which are not known at this time'.
USAir, which recently took over operating the Trump Shuttle service between
Washington, New York and Boston, is seen as one of the most financially
fragile US carriers.
It has made after-tax losses of Dollars 305.3m and Dollars 454.4m in 1990
and 1991 respectively. Yesterday, its shares rose Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 13
3/8 at close of trade, but they have been as high as Dollars 19 5/8 and as
low as Dollars 7 1/8 over the past year.

FT  29 APR 92 / International Company News: Offshore futures fund open to UK
retail investors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JOHNSON Fry, the UK financial services group, is marketing a guaranteed
offshore futures fund, called the US Masters Guaranteed Futures Fund, to UK
retail investors.
Most offshore futures funds sold in the UK are aimed at high net-worth
individuals. The US Masters Fund, however, requires an unusually small
minimum investment of Pounds 2,000. The initial investment is fully
guaranteed by Barclays Bank.
The fund is structured as a closed-end investment company, incorporated in
the Isle of Man, which runs for a set period of seven years.
Profits are rolled up and paid out only at the end of that period, so that
capital gains tax, rather than income tax, is paid.
The US Masters Fund will use three US trading advisers, each of which has at
least Dollars 50m of clients funds under management. They all have a track
record of at least seven years, with an annual average rate return of at
least 20 per cent.
The Securities and Futures Authority is examining an advertisement for the
Johnson Fry fund, which appeared in this week's Economist magazine, to
decide whether it follows SFA rules.
Under legislation passed last year, unit trusts using futures can now be
sold to UK retail investors. The two structures permitted  - futures and
options funds and geared futures and options funds  - are restricted in
their use of futures and cannot be guaranteed.
So far, only two companies have launched unit trusts using futures and
options. Legal and General, which targetted at retail investors, has so far
raised Pounds 10m (Dollars 17m).
In the US, the managed futures business has expanded swiftly since the early
1980s. It currently has more than Dollars 20bn under management.
Typically, futures funds are externally managed on a discretionary basis by
specialist trading advisers.
An offshore market for futures funds targetted at European and Japanese
investors has also grown up in recent years. Most of the funds under
management are run by US-based trading advisers.

FT  29 APR 92 / International Company News: Yanase set to unveil Opel
distribution deal - The Japanese importer's switch from VW has wider
implications
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Yanase, the dominant foreign car importer and distributor in Japan, is
expected to announce an agreement with Opel, the main European subsidiary of
General Motors of the US, to become the exclusive importer and distributor
of Opel products in Japan.
The deal follows Yanase's disclosure last week that it was abandoning its
long-standing relationship with Volkswagen, the German carmaker, which it
has built into the leading foreign car importer in Japan.
Yanase's change of allegiance to Opel heralds a significant shake-up in the
hard-fought imported car market in Japan, which is dominated by the German
makes of VW/Audi, Mercedes-Benz and BMW. It offers GM the chance to make an
important breakthrough for its European-built cars.
Volkswagen, the leading western car exporter to Japan with its VW and Audi
makes, expects a substantial setback to its Japanese sales in the short
term, following Yanase's move to give up the VW/Audi franchise with effect
from the end of 1992.
Yanase's switch to sell Opel through its extensive Japanese dealer network
has been prompted by an increasingly bitter conflict with the VW group,
which it has represented in Japan for 38 years.
It has been dismayed by VW's decision to replace it as the general
importer/distributor, with the creation of its own wholly owned
importer-distributor subsidiary, Volkswagen Audi Nippon (VAN).
It is also upset at VW's decision to develop an additional sales channel
through a co-operation deal with Toyota, the leading Japanese carmaker.
In a attack on VW's sales and marketing plans, Yanase claimed the German
carmaker had fixed a sales target of 100,000 cars a year in Japan
'regardless of the actual size of the imported car market'.
It said that by making investments based on a target of 100,000 units, and
by appointing too many dealers, VW may 'unnecessarily deprive dealers of
both channels of their profitability due to disorderly marketing and
excessive competition'.
It claimed that under the VW strategy, the market would become 'chaotic';
VW/Audi owners would be 'inconvenienced'; and the operation of the Yanase
network would become 'unviable'.
Yanase has agreed to provide after-sales service for existing VW/Audi
customers during the two years  - 1993 and 1994  - after it terminates its
sales contract.
Volkswagen must now accelerate its plans to develop its two other sales
channels. One, called Fahren, will be developed under the direction of
Volkswagen Audi Nippon (VAN). The second Duo, is being developed by Toyota.
VW will become much more dependent on it.
It will have to scale back the ambitious target announced last autumn by Mr
Carl Hahn, VW management board chairman, to double its sales of VW and Audi
cars in Japan to around 100,000 by 1995.
Mr Hahn said last year the group would have a network of nearly 300 sales
outlets operating in Japan by 1992, with a 45-strong Volkswagen Audi Nippon
network and 50 sales outlets to be set up by Toyota as well as around 180
Yanase dealers.
Under the co-operation deal with Toyota  - the first time Toyota dealers
will handle imported cars  - the aim has been to sell 7,000 cars this year,
with an increase to 30,000 a year through 100 sales outlets by 1996.
In the wake of Yanase's withdrawal, Volkswagen said in Tokyo it expected its
sales in Japan to fall to around 32,000 in 1993 from a planned level of
48,000 in 1992. This year's figure still includes 39,000 cars to be sold
through Yanase's 178-strong dealer network. This could prove
over-optimistic, however, and VW's leading position in Japan will be under
threat, at least in the short term.
VW said it planned to increase its Fahren sales channel from 25 dealers to
42 by end of the year, with a further 40 outlets being added in 1993. Its
Toyota-controlled Duo sales channel will be increased from 5 outlets to 36
by the end of the year, with the addition of 15 more dealerships next year.
VW/Audi sales in Japan last year totalled 44,562, with around 95 per cent of
the volume sold through the Yanase dealer network.
The VW/Audi makes accounted for 22.6 per cent of imported car sales in
Japan, making it the leading foreign car group in Japan ahead of
Mercedes-Benz, the automotive subsidiary of Daimler-Benz, with sales of
34,187 and an import share of 17.3 per cent, and BMW with sales of 33,798
and an import share of 17.1 per cent.
Total car imports to Japan declined by 11.1 per cent last year to 197,184  -
compared with a fall in the overall market of 4.6 per cent to 4.87m  - and
accounted for only 4.1 per cent of the Japanese new car market. The decline
was a significant setback to importers' long-term goal of gaining 10 per
cent of Japanese new car sales during the 1990s.
The main beneficiary of the Yanase/Volkswagen conflict will be Opel,
ironically the number two make in VW's domestic German market, where it is
also challenging.
Opel cars have, in the past, been distributed in Japan by Isuzu, GM's
Japanese affiliate, and the Toho Motors dealer group. Opel's performance has
been disappointing, however, with sales of only 2,725 cars last year
compared with a target of 10,000 a year set in the late 1980s.
Under the terms of the deal to be announced shortly, Yanase is expected to
become Opel's sole importer and distributor in Japan, although there may
still be a small residual role for some selected Isuzu dealers.
Although the immediate aim for Opel will be to reach the 10,000 cars a year
target, its ambitions are higher, given the capacity of the Yanase network,
which was capable of selling 53,461 VW/Audi cars in 1990.

WHIRLPOOL, the world's biggest maker of large domestic appliances and now
the full owner of the former Philips' businesses in Europe, saw earnings
increase to Dollars 35m in the first quarter of 1992, compared with Dollars
24m in the same period a year earlier.
Sales rose by about 6.5 per cent, to Dollars 1.72bn. The results were only
slightly below most analysts' forecasts, but the shares still greeted the
news with a Dollars 2 5/8 fall to Dollars 42 7/8 .
There was some speculation that the worse-than-expected results from the
Brazilian affiliates  - where Whirlpool's share of losses was Dollars 10m
compared with Dollars 17m a year ago  - lay behind the reaction. With the
reduction in Brazilian losses stripped, moreover, the earnings improvement
looked less impressive.
However, Mr David Whit-wam, chairman, said the Whirlpool, Kenmore and
KitchenAid appliance groups in the US had shown 'notable' revenue gains,
with shipment increases in the quarter topping the industry's average of 2
per cent. The result, he said, was a 'dramatic' improvement in operating
results.
He predicted that, for 1992 overall, shipments in the North American
industry could rise by about 6 per cent as the economy recovered.
In Europe, by contrast, industry shipments for the quarter were down
slightly, although Whirlpool Interna-tional managed an increase.
For the year overall, the company is predicting a 1 per cent increase in
home appliance shipments for the European industry generally.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NOBEL Industries, the Swed-ish chemicals group, yesterday concluded
financial settlements with its banks and its former finance company
subsidiary after months of acrimonious wrangling.
Nobel said its shareholders' capital would be increased by SKr800m (Dollars
134.2m) after the agreement, the terms of which were welcomed by all of the
parties concerned.
The settlement freed Nobel and Nordbanken, the main bank involved, to draw a
clean slate and concentrate on their normal operations in future,
participants said.
Under the terms of the agreement, Nordbanken, the state-controlled bank
which owns 70 per cent of the shares in Nobel, will pay SKr560m to the
chemicals group. The payment would then allow Nobel to settle its
obligations towards Gamlestaden, the loss-laden finance company in which the
chemicals group had a 48 per cent stake.
Nobel has already paid SKr1.9bn to Gamlestaden and had received demands for
a further SKr723m in payments to the finance company. However, according to
yesterday's agreement, Nobel only has to pay a further SKr520m.
Furthermore, the deal relieves Nobel of any further financial responsibility
towards Gamlestaden.
When Gamlestaden collapsed last summer because of heavy losses in the real
estate sector, the financial troubles spread to Nobel, its main shareholder.
Nobel had made a loan guarantee to secure bank lending to Gamlestaden, and
was threatened with bankruptcy as Gamlestaden's credit losses mounted.
Gamlestaden has accumulated credit losses of SKr8bn and is now owned by a
consortium of banks.
Nobel, which was controlled by Mr Erik Penser, the Swedish financier, had to
be rescued last August by Nordbanken. The bank in turn took over Mr Penser's
70 per cent stake in Nobel, saying that he had failed to fulfil his loan
agreements.
The banks' conduct in the Nobel affair was subsequently criticised by an
independent report.
Although the banks refused to admit that they had behaved incorrectly, legal
advisers suggested the independent report had played a vital role in
encouraging yesterday's financial settlement between the banks and Nobel.
Nordbanken said that the banks had 'decided it would take too much time,
effort and money to carry on with this legal dispute.'
Last Friday, Mr Erik Penser agreed to withdraw his SKr3.8bn legal suit
against Nordbanken after the bank agreed to return Yggdrasil, his former
holding company, to him.

THE continuing recession slowed growth in BCE's telecommunications business
in the first quarter this year, but tight expense control, especially in
long distance service, helped to cushion the impact.
Overall BCE reported net profit of CDollars 273m (USDollars 231.3m), or 88
cents a share, after preferred dividends, up from CDollars 269m, or 88
cents, in the first quarter of 1991.
Total operating revenue was CDollars 4.86bn against CDollars 4.72bn.
Bell Canada, the telecommunications subsidiary, earned CDollars 241m against
CDollars 243m on operating revenues of CDollars 1.95bn, against CDollars
1.89bn. It contributed CDollars 222m, or 71 cents a share, to BCE's profit
against CDollars 227m, or 74 cents.
BCE Mobile Communications, the cellular telephone subsidiary, had a
first-quarter loss of Dollars 5.6m, or 8 cents a share, against a loss of
Dollars 6.4m, or 10 cents, a year earlier.

<TEXT>
A STRONG improvement in PepsiCo's snack food division in the first three
months of 1992 offset weaker soft drinks earnings and allowed the company to
report an 18 per cent increase in after-tax profits at Dollars 241.5m.
Sales increased by 11 per cent to Dollars 4.58bn, and earnings per share
were up by 15 per cent to 30 cents.
PepsiCo saw a 10 per cent increase in soft drink sales, but operating
profits in the division fell 3 per cent to Dollars 156.9m.
The company said there had been a sharp fall in international profits,
mainly because of a decline in bottling results. In the US, profits grew by
1 per cent, with the weaker growth rate explained by increased operating
expenses and a 'difficult' comparison with 1991 because of a previous asset
sale.
Operating profits in the snack foods were 17 per cent higher at Dollars
205.1m, on a 6 per cent sales increase to Dollars 1.3bn.

Neither company disclosed the terms of the sale of the US assets of Maxwell

The business is believed to have less than Dollars 2m of annual revenues and

MCC filed last year for protection from creditors under US bankruptcy law.
Macmillan, its New York subsidiary, continues to operate while co-ordinating

The sale of the US arm of Maxwell Business Communications is part of a

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
RJR Nabisco, the US food and tobacco group which was subject to a Dollars
25bn buy-out in 1989, slipped back into the red during the first quarter of
1992, due to a Dollars 159m extraordinary charge related to the repurchase
of debt securities.
The after-tax deficit amounted to Dollars 15m, compared with a small Dollars
5m profit in the first quarter of 1991. For 1991 overall, RJR made a net
profit of Dollars 368m.
The company's operating income, struck after amortisation charges of Dollars
152m (Dollars 153m) but before interest costs, totalled Dollars 664m,
against Dollars 647m a year earlier. Net sales overall were 5 per cent
higher at Dollars 3.64bn.
Tobacco sales rose by 7 per cent to Dollars 2.1bn, driven by the
international business. Excluding the effects of a significant Russian order
in 1991, overseas sales would have been up by 10 per cent, with volumes
increasing by 8 per cent  - principally in the Middle East and Asia.
In the domestic market, there was 'a slight volume increase'. The results
benefited from price increases but this was more than offset by higher
marketing expenditures. The total 'business unit contribution' - before
amortisation  - was Dollars 651m, against Dollars 648m.
Net sales of food products were just 2 per cent higher at Dollars 1.54bn,
and the business unit contribution increased from Dollars 171m to Dollars
189m.
In contrast to the flat operating performance, RJR Nabisco's interest costs
fell sharply because of relentless financial restructuring. Cash interest
payments fell from Dollars 307m to Dollars 250m, while non-cash interest
charges were Dollars 126m, compared with Dollars 294m.

<TEXT>
EASTMAN Kodak, the world's biggest maker of photographic equipment,
yesterday reported a 19 per cent decline in first-quarter net earnings on
sales that were essentially flat.
The company, in the midst of its fifth restructuring since 1983, had warned
in March it would have a 'difficult' first quarter and its recovery would be
only gradual.
Kodak had net income of Dollars 145m, or 45 cents a share, on sales of
Dollars 4.41bn in the first three months of 1992, compared with earnings of
Dollars 178m or 55 cents on sales of Dollars 4.42bn a year earlier.
Mr Kay Whitmore, chairman and chief executive, said the results were hardly
satisfying. 'Respectable margins in health and chemicals were accompanied by
poor rates of return in imaging and information, where problem areas are
being vigorously addressed.'
Mr Whitmore said earnings were hurt by higher costs, unfavourable currency
translations, lower selling prices and higher spending on research and
development.
The results were released after the close of trade yesterday. Kodak's shares
closed at Dollars 38 1/2 , down Dollars  1/8 . The issue fell Dollars 1 7/8
to Dollars 40 3/4 in March after Kodak suggested its 1992 earnings would be
about Dollars 3.50 a share, below the Dollars 4-range most analysts had
expected.
Mr Whitmore said: 'We look forward to better results with the expectation
that sales will continue to recover, particularly in the second half, and
that earnings will benefit from actions to restore operating margins to more
satisfactory levels.'

SILICON Graphics, the US computer workstation maker which last month agreed
to acquire Mips Computer Systems, said yesterday that the two companies had
renegotiated the terms of the deal.
The deal was originally valued at about Dollars 400m, based on a stock-swap
formula in which each share of Mips would be exchanged for 0.61 shares of
Silicon Graphics.
Since then, Mips, a leading developer of Risc (reduced instruction set
computing) microprocessors, has reported disappointing first-quarter
earnings and its stock price has fallen sharply. Silicon Graphics' share
price has also declined by almost 40 per cent since the announcement.
On Monday, the companies said that Silicon Graphics would exchange 0.52
shares for each share of Mips, a 15 per cent reduction. This would reduce
the value of the deal to about Dollars 200m at current share prices.

concern

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
OLYMPIA &amp; York has called a special meeting next month at which holders of
bonds secured by a Manhattan office building expect they will be asked for
concessions to help conserve the property developer's cash flow.
Such a request would be a departure from the debt-restructuring plan
outlined by O&amp;Y three weeks ago. The plan envisages segregating O&amp;Y's
relatively healthy North American property portfolio from the rest of its
Dollars 12bn debt.
O&amp;Y said yesterday the purpose of the meeting was solely to bring holders of
Dollars 548m of bonds secured by the building at 55 Water Street up to date
on recent developments.
However, bondholders are expecting that they will be asked to defer Dollars
35m in annual interest payments due on June 30. Although collateral on the
53-storey building appears sufficient to meet the June interest obligation,
longer-term cash flows are threatened by the expiry of a sizeable portion of
leases this year and in 1993.
Mr Michael Barr, an analyst at H Rivkin &amp; Co, a New York bond trading house
which represents some holders of Water Street paper, said any move by O&amp;Y to
defer interest was likely to be resisted by the bondholders.
The Water Street financing, arranged through a single-purpose company, was
designed to protect investors from any financial problems of O&amp;Y itself.
Cash flow from the property must be used for running expenses and bond
payments before it can be channelled to O&amp;Y.
In another sign of the growing number of brushfires threatening O&amp;Y, the
trustee of an overdue Canadian commercial paper programme has called a
meeting on May 20 which is likely to consider a resolution declaring the
company in default.
The commercial paper is secured by the 36-storey Exchange Tower in Toronto,
which O&amp;Y has been trying to sell and lease back with the help of a Canadian
government loan guarantee. But a tentative deal has come unstuck following
the government's reluctance to be involved.
Under the Exchange Tower trust indenture, the trustee is obliged to put O&amp;Y
in default if 25 per cent of paper holders ask it to do so.
O&amp;Y is expected to tell the meeting that the investors may have more to lose
by putting the company into default than by waiting for a sale of the
building or a wider debt-restructuring agreement.
The company has failed to make several debt payments since its liquidity
crisis surfaced last month. But it did pay about Dollars 6m in monthly
interest two weeks ago to holders of floating-rate notes secured by three
New York buildings.
O&amp;Y has not indicated whether it plans to pay CDollars 25.4m (USDollars
21.5m) in semi-annual interest due by May 14 on bonds secured by the
72-storey First Canadian Place in Toronto.

steel operations

<TEXT>
THE two largest steel makers in the US  - USX and Bethlehem Steel  -
underlined the weakness of the market yesterday when they reported
first-quarter losses from their steel-making operations, albeit lower than
their losses in the same period of last year.
USX said its steel group, which has a separate stock market quotation from
its Marathon energy business, lost Dollars 13m, or 27 cents a share, on
sales of Dollars 1.2bn, compared with a net loss of Dollars 308m, or Dollars
6.06, on Dollars 1.1bn of sales a year earlier.
As a group, USX reported net income of Dollars 22m, compared with a loss of
Dollars 237m a year ago, on sales of Dollars 4.1bn, down from Dollars 4.5bn.
Bethlehem reported a net loss of Dollars 45m, or 66 cents a share, up from
Dollars 39m, or 60 cents, in the same period of last year. Sales totalled
Dollars 995.4m, down from Dollars 1.05bn a year earlier.
Mr Charles Corry, USX chairman, said that while the company's results were
much improved, 'recessionary demand levels and excess world steel capacity
continued to push steel prices down in the first quarter'.
Results had also been hit by a plant fire.
Marathon reported net income of Dollars 35m, or 12 cents a share, compared
with Dollars 71m, or 27 cents, down from Dollars 3.4bn to Dollars 2.9bn. The
main cause of the decline was lower crude prices and refined product
margins.
Bethlehem, which forecast continuing losses in the second quarter, said that
while its steel shipments had been significantly higher in the first
quarter, realised prices were lower, offsetting the benefits of higher
volume. The results were also affected by higher labour and interest costs.
Its basic steel operations lost Dollars 22m, an improvement on the Dollars
26m reported a year ago. Average realised prices remained at the extremely
low levels of 1991's fourth quarter, although shipments increased following
completion of a blast furnace reline at its large Burns Harbor plant.
Bethlehem said it planned to generate Dollars 200m from asset sales during
the year, mainly from the previously heralded sale of its coal operations.
It was too early to judge the potential proceeds from the disposal of its
bar and rod operations, which Bethlehem put up for sale at the start of the
year and which were excluded from its reported results.
It added that, while there were some encouraging signs of recovery in the US
economy, it expected to report a second-quarter net loss and anticipated
only moderate improvement in steel demand for the rest of the year.
Nucor, the largest of the US mini-mills, which have been taking market share
from integrated steel makers, yesterday reported first-quarter net income of
Dollars 16.2m, up from Dollars 13.99m in the same period of last year, on
sales which rose from Dollars 351m to Dollars 388m.

<TEXT>
PILKINGTON, the glass group, is appointing Mr Roger Leverton as group chief
executive. He is replacing Mr Derek Cook, group managing director and deputy
chairman, who will retire in June having reached the normal retirement age
of 60 last December.
Mr Leverton is currently president and chief executive of Indal, a Canadian
subsidiary of RTZ, the mining and industrial group. He is 53, and will join
Pilkington in July.
Sir Antony Pilkington, chairman, said that Mr Leverton had 'an excellent
track record as an international manager'.
His appointment would help with the strategy of 'increasing the group's
focus in our key business territories around the world,' Sir Antony added.
Mr Leverton was chief executive of MK Electric, the electrical products
maker, which RTZ took over in 1988 through a hostile bid.
Previously he had been with Black &amp; Decker, the electrical goods group. Sir
Antony said the appointment was the result of a search, aided by
headhunters, for a new chief executive and Mr Cook had stayed on past
retirement age until the place was filled.
Lord Croham, an independent director, is to retire in December and Sir
Michael Quinlan, a former permanent under-secretary at the Ministry of
Defence, will join the board as a non-executive in October.
Pilkington, which makes glass for both the construction and automotive
industries, has suffered badly in the recession in the UK and North America
with profits down from Pounds 314.3m to Pounds 151.6m in the 1990-91 year.
Its shares have been under a cloud since it fought off a hostile takeover
bid from BTR, the conglomerate, in January 1987.
In the past two years Pilkington has been reviewing all its operations and
has sold a number of peripheral activities which were not performing.
Bid speculation flared again when BTR increased its stake in December 1990
but has since subsided once more.

chairman forced to go early says non-executive director
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIR JOHN Quinton, chairman of Barclays, yesterday said the decision to
appoint his successor from within the bank was evidence that his departure
was not forced by anyone disappointed with the bank's performance.
However, his remarks were made as a senior non-executive director said the
chairman had been pushed to go 'a bit earlier' than planned because there
was a need to tackle Barclay's problems with a fresh team as soon as
possible.
Mr Andrew Buxton, deputy chairman, is to replace Sir John as chief executive
from the beginning of next month and as chairman from the end of the year.
Talk of a boardroom coup within the last few weeks was strongly denied by
Sir John, who said that he had always planned to give up the chairmanship at
the end of the year.
Asked whether he had hoped to hang on to his executive duties for a little
longer he replied: 'No, not really. There will not be a great deal of
difference since I will still be working five days a week for Barclays.'
However, a non-executive director said the board had felt that changes had
to be put in place sooner than envisaged by Sir John in order to address the
problems facing Barclays, including escalating costs. The non-executive
added: 'It is not as easy to look forward when you are approaching 63'.
The bank's non-executive directors include Sir Martin Jacomb, the bank's
deputy chairman and a Bank of England director, Sir Nigel Mobbs, chairman of
the property company Slough Estates, Sir Denys Henderson, chairman of
Imperial Chemical Industries, and Sir James Spooner, chairman of the Morgan
Crucible conglomerate.
It also emerged yesterday that the non-executive directors had forced the
pace of management change in Barclays in order to ensure Mr Buxton's
succession.
Some non-executives felt that Mr Buxton may have left the group if his
position had not been clarified this month.
Sir Peter Middleton, deputy chairman, said: 'It was absolutely key that
Andrew (Buxton) stayed on since we needed someone who understood the
business. Although I never heard Andrew suggesting that he might go.'
Mr Buxton said he was keen to develop Barclay's international role which he
compared favourably with what he called Lloyds' 'retrenchment in the UK'. He
added: 'I want us to become a major European bank with interests across the
world.'
Sir John said he doubted whether Mr Buxton would change the bank's strategy.
'I have been developing my strategy with my colleagues.
'It would be somewhat strange if we then set off on an immediate different
strategy.'
In order to rebuff criticism that one man should not be both chief executive
and chairman Mr Buxton said that he planned to dilute the two senior jobs by
sharing many of his duties with Sir Peter, who is to become responsible for
the service business division as well as Barclays de Zoete Wedd.
Mr Alastair Robinson, who will continue to head the banking division, will
also become a vice chairman of the group.

FT  29 APR 92 / UK Company News: Acquisitive Waterford Foods shows 40%
advance to IPounds 15.9m

WATERFORD FOODS, now Ireland's largest dairy group following the completion
of its acquisition yesterday of three Grand Metropolitan subsidiaries in
Ireland, reported a 40 per cent jump in pre-tax profits, from IPounds 11.3m
to IPounds 15.86m (Pounds 14.4m), for the year to December 31.
Turnover was 3.5 per cent down, from IPounds 439m to IPounds 424m, but
operating cash flow increased by IPounds 4.2m to IPounds 24.9m.
Mr Stephen O'Connor, managing director, said that all segments of the
business had performed well during the year and there had been a
sig-nificant reduction in interest costs by IPounds 3.1m to IPounds 6.8m,
improving interest cover to 3.3 times.
He said that IPounds 58m in goodwill relating to the acquisition in 1989 of
Healds Dairies in northern England and Galloway West in the US has now been
written off.
Analysts in Dublin were encouraged by the results and are anticipating
strong earnings growth in the coming year, as Waterford's latest
acquisitions are consolidated into the group.
These are United Co-operative Dairies (UCD) in northern England which was
acquired in November last year, and which is being integrated into the
Healds operations, and the three Grand Metropolitan subsidiaries in Ireland
which have just been purchased for a consideration of IPounds 63.2m.
Mr O'Connor also announced Waterford's intention to buy the remaining 50 per
cent stake in WED, one of the three Grand Met subsidiaries, held by
Waterford Co-op and which is the principal shareholder in the Waterford
Group.
This will involve a further consideration of IPounds 26.4m. The acquisitions
are being financed from the recent IPounds 24.3m rights issue and new
borrowings.
Mr Michael Dempsey, assistant chief executive for finance, said that the
goodwill involved in the UCD and Grand Met acquisitions, amounting to
IPounds 66m, will be written off over 20 years.
Mr O'Connor anticipates that the group's annual turnover will now increase
to more than IPounds 700m, and will generate operating profits in the region
of IPounds 40m.
Some words of warning have been issued by brokers over the group's
borrowings to finance its acquisitions, estimated at IPounds 130m, although
the company believes this will be paid off 'in two to three years' out of
the increased cash flow.
Mr O'Connor said that interest cover is expected to remain above 3, despite
the new borrowings.
Earnings per share rose to 9.27p (6.26p) and a final dividend of 1.525p per
A share is recommended, giving a total for the year of 2.625p (2.5p).

FT  29 APR 92 / UK Company News: Regulatory hurdles may prove a stumbling
block for Lloyds' bid - The Battle for Midland
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES, ANDREW HILL and ROBERT RICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PRIME condition attached to Lloyds' bid is that it should have to run
through no more regulatory hoops than its rival, the Hongkong and Shanghai
Bank. Yet it was far from clear yesterday that this would be possible
because of the complexities of the two-tier UK and EC regulatory structure.
Lloyds' fear is that, without this condition, its bid could run foul of the
UK Monopolies and Mergers Commission because of the large share of the UK
market which Lloyds/Midland bank would enjoy. On the other hand, the
competing bid could sail through because of Hongkong Bank's relatively small
share of the European banking market.
'This area is quite untested,' said Sir Jeremy Morse, Lloyds chairman,
yesterday. 'This will be an early, big case.'
Under EC rules dating from September 1990, a bid must be scrutinised by
Brussels if the proposed merger exceeds a certain size, and a given
proportion of its business is located within the EC. The Hongkong bid is
already the subject of a four-week inquiry by Brussels to see whether it is
'compatible with the common market'.
It is unclear whether a Lloyds/Midland bid would also fall within Brussels'
ambit. Competition lawyers say the decisive factor will be whether the banks
have more than two-thirds of their business in the UK. In that case, the
deal would automatically fall under British jurisdiction. Commission
officials refused to be drawn on their calculations about the Lloyds/Midland
case.
The crucial questions, though, concern what happens at the UK end. These
are:
 -Will the UK authorities investigate the bid? This will depend on the
Office of Fair Trading, but the chances look high because of the two banks'
large combined UK business. Together, they would have about 30 per cent of
the market on many measures, compared with about 25 per cent each for
NatWest and Barclays.
 -If the OFT does recommend a referral to the MMC, would the UK also
investigate the Hongkong bid, as Lloyds is demanding it should? For this to
happen, Brussels would either have to decide that the case fell outside its
authority and hand it back to the UK, or the UK could ask for it back on
national interest grounds.
 -If there was a UK monopolies inquiry, would the MMC judge the proposed
mergers purely on the narrow grounds of competition? Or would it take into
account the wider national interest, given the huge size of the banks
involved, their key role in the economy, and the thousands of jobs at stake?
During the 1980s, Mr Norman Tebbit, when trade secretary, sought to confine
inquiries to competition issues. But the new trade secretary, Mr Michael
Heseltine, may have different ideas.
Mr Heseltine is thought to be more interventionist and may prefer to return
to a more widely based test of the public interest set out in the 1973 Fair
Trading Act. This might include having regard to 'the desirability of
maintaining and promoting the balanced distribution of industry and
employment in the UK'. Lloyds' plans to shed up to 20,000 jobs from the
merged bank might well fall foul of this test.
There are no useful precedents to make the picture clearer. The last big
wave of bank mergers took place more than 20 years ago, since when monopoly
policies have changed radically, not least with the arrival of Brussels on
the scene.
The Bank of England takes a studiously neutral view of bank mergers  - at
least in public. But regulators are generally thought to favour them because
they soften competition and should result in more strongly capitalised
banks.
There are many possibilities as to what could happen next. If the Commission
decides it has serious doubts about the effect on competition it can open a
four-month in-depth investigation. If those doubts are confirmed, Sir Leon
Brittan, the competition commissioner, can recommend that the deal should be
blocked, or amended. It could be another five to six months before Hongkong
Bank knows whether it can proceed with the deal.
The Lloyds bid will face an investigation by the OFT (which could take
anything up to a month) before the director general of fair trading can
decide whether to recommend to the trade secretary that it should be
referred to the MMC. An MMC investigation could take about three months,
after which its recommendations would go to Mr Heseltine for his final
decision. All in all the process could take six months.
Because of the pre-conditions Lloyds has attached to its bid, the Takeover
Code clock, which gives a bidder 28 days to post an offer document, will not
start running. But Lloyds will still be subject to rules on acquiring and
disclosing shares in Midland Bank. The bid would automatically lapse if it
was investigated either by Brussels or the UK. But it could be many months
before either bidder faces a clear road.
Lloyds' advisers said they would be seeking confirmation from the Takeover
Panel that in the event of a successful takeover for Midland it would not
have to make a bid for 3i, the venture capital group, or a number of trade
investments where its combined shareholding would be above the critical 30
per cent level.

FT  29 APR 92 / UK Company News: Bifu pledges to fight as job fears are
confirmed - The Battle for Midland
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE MAIN banking union, the Banking, Insurance and Finance Union, yesterday
pledged to fight a Lloyds takeover of Midland at the Mergers and Monopolies
Commission, in parliament and, if necessary, in Europe.
Bifu is hoping to scupper any bid by intensive lobbying  - there had been no
discussion at this stage of industrial action, it said.
Union fears that more than 20,000 jobs out of a total of 110,000 could be
lost through a merged Lloyds-Midland operation were later confirmed by
Lloyds. However, the bank stressed its intention to minimise compulsory
redundancies. The union was yesterday in talks with Lloyds personnel chiefs
in an attempt to strengthen existing agreements on job security.
Bifu, which represents nearly three quarters of Midland's staff at all
levels, has already expressed its preference for a bid by the Hongkong and
Shanghai Bank, from which it has had assurances on jobs.
The union said its argument to the MMC would be that Lloyds 'would be
eliminating one of its competitors with one hit and gaining an unfair
advantage by taking over Midland customers.' In contrast, a merger with
Hongkong Bank would 'bring new money into the country and increase
competition.'
Mr Ed Sweeney, Bifu deputy general secretary, said: 'No job at either bank
would be safe. We are totally opposed to a Lloyds bid which would be bad for
jobs and bad for customers. The disappearance of a familiar face from the
high street will not help competition one bit.'
More than 10,000 jobs have already gone in Lloyds over the past three years,
said Bifu. Overall, the union calculates that at least 27,000 jobs were lost
from financial services companies last year. Even before yesterday's
announcements, Bifu was predicting that at least 30,000 further jobs in the
sector would disappear this year out of a total of about 500,000.
It was too early to say which group of staff would come off worst, said the
union. Closures would depend on individual geographical considerations and
which bank had the best facilities in any particular area. Job casualties
would be among support functions, such as information technology centres, as
well as in high street branches, said Bifu.

FT  29 APR 92 / UK Company News: Takeover reactions vary - The Battle for
Midland
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
LARGE companies mostly welcomed the prospect of a leaner fitter banking
sector following a takeover of Midland bank.
Small and medium companies were more concerned about the possible reduction
of competition.
Mr Gerald Corbett, finance director of Redland, the large building materials
group said: 'In terms of clearing bank services, there is little between the
major banks. I cannot see that it would make any difference to us.'
Mr David Chater, finance director of Radyot, a maker of components for
commercial vehicles based in Cradley Heath, east Midlands, said: 'I believe
in free competition and survival of the fittest. The engineering industry
has seen a vast amount of rationalisation during the past ten years and this
sort of move is long overdue in the banking sector. It's a good thing if it
makes banks leaner and fitter.'
The chief executive of a large textile company said: 'This should have
happened years ago. Damage has been done to the banking industry by the Bank
of England's reluctance to allow this kind of thing.
'Any reduction in competition will not be damaging. If there are any signs
of a cartel forming, then continental banks will start to play the UK
business sector. Large companies do not rely on clearing banks anyway. Small
business is a different matter, but Royal Bank of Scotland and other
Scottish banks provide a serious alternative.'
Most large industrial companies said that they used a range of domestic and
international banks to raise finance and for corporate advice and would not
be inconvenienced by a takeover of Midland.
Most companies welcomed the possibility of lower charges as a result of the
closure of redundant branches and duplicated services.
Other companies were concerned about the loss of competition. T Cowie, the
Sunderland-based motor finance and retail group, said it had banked with
Midland for many years, borrowing money to finance its 60,000 vehicle
company car fleet.
Mr Gordon Hodgson, chief executive, said: 'We believe a successful bid from
Lloyds would mean less competition in the supply of money, not more.
'From our point of view, a successful bid by Lloyds would be extremely
disappointing. We have enjoyed a very positive business relationship with
Midland going back several decades. We have always found them to be very
good at servicing our business, so we would be very concerned about the
level of service from Lloyds.'
Mr Frank Nicholson, managing director of Vaux Breweries, part of the Vaux
Group, warned: 'Big in banking is not always beautiful.' Vaux, founded 170
years ago, has banked for a century or more with Lloyds.

FT  29 APR 92 / UK Company News: Dismay marks small businesses' response -
The Battle for Midland
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR and CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DISMAY WAS the overriding response of Britain's small businesses to
yesterday's announcement of Lloyds Bank's plan to bid for Midland Bank.
Reducing the number of large high street banking groups from four to three
would restrict competition and further tilt the balance of power towards the
large banking groups, according to small business owners and small business
organisations.
The proposal comes at a time when small businesses are already disillusioned
with the quality of service provided by the banks, particularly in the wake
of last year's government investigation of allegations that bankers were not
passing on lower interest charges to their customers.
The Forum of Private Business, with 19,000 members, calculated a merger
would create a bank with 32 per cent of the small firms market (20 per cent
from Lloyds and 12 per cent from Midland) compared with the 25 per cent
market shares held by National Westminster Bank and Barclays Bank.
Mr Jonathan Fowler, chairman of Chinecrest Archives, a Pounds 1m turnover
company which stores documents for the banks and for insurance companies,
pointed out: 'The larger companies have the bargaining power to stand up to
the banks, but we have to go along with what they say'.
A merger of the two banks would concentrate power in the banking field and
in secondary areas of financing such as leasing and factoring, where both
banks already have sizeable operations.
Mr John Cartwright, joint founder of Excalibur CBK, a Stoke-on-Trent-based
manufacturer of fire fighting vehicles with sales of Pounds 2m and 25
employees, said: 'I see this as the thin end of the wedge'.
Mr Cartwright, who has banked with Barclays since setting up Excalibur eight
years ago, said he feared that small businesses would have very limited
choice if they wanted to change banks in future.
Apart from a lack of choice he considered that a merger would also create
banking organisations even more remote from the concerns of small
businesses.
Ms Jane Lyon, managing director of Clam-Brummer, an east London manufacturer
of industrial adhesives, said: 'A merged Lloyds/Midland would be even more
out of touch with its small business accounts'.
The Federation of Small Businesses, which has 50,000 members, described the
timing of the proposed merger as particularly unfortunate.
Mr Stephen Alambritis, for the FSB, said: 'This is a backward step during a
recession. The banks already have a bad name for trying to recoup their
losses from small businesses.'

   MR MICHAEL Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, faces strong

<TEXT>
perhaps unstoppable  - political pressure to refer a Lloyds' bid for Midland
to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission.
Most Conservative MPs believe he should take a tough stance against Lloyds,
in what would be one of his first decisions in his new job.
'If it were to be waved through without a referral there would be great
disquiet,' said Sir Michael Grylls, who was chairman of the Tory backbench
trade and industry committee in the last Parliament. Labour was also swift
to call for an MMC investigation.
One MP with experience at the Department of Trade and Industry said the
director general of fair trading was almost certain to recommend referral
and Mr Heseltine could not refuse  - particularly given the anxiety of
Tories about the banks' role during the recession, especially towards small
businesses.
Hostility towards a Hongkong Bank bid for Midland was less marked because it
was seen as less of a threat to competition.

Battle for Midland
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
MICHAEL thought he had a job for life until he heard the news. A counter
clerk at a London branch of Midland, he said: 'It's shattering news. We have
always sacrificed salaries for security and perks like low mortgages. If I
lose my job I will lose my house. I have no chance of getting another job in
banking. The uncertainty is really stressful.'
Most staff were unwilling to talk yesterday. Resistance was not given a
thought as staff tried to keep a low profile and their jobs. Lloyds staff
are in breach of their contracts if they make public statements.
Jane is a cashier in a Midland branch in the north-east. She said: 'There
isn't a branch of Lloyds nearby, so my immediate reaction was that I'd be
OK. Locally, Barclays and NatWest are our competitors and we keep an eye on
what they're doing.'.
Jane comes from an area which has seen a sharp decline in traditional
industries and manufacturing jobs. This has had an impact on male
employment, in particular, and many households rely heavily on women's
earnings.
Midland will not say how many of their staff have subsidised mortgages, but
Bifu, the banking union, believes about a third benefit from the scheme.
Like Michael, Jane fears for her home.
'A lot of our lives are bound up with the bank: we get a 5 per cent mortgage
and I'm in a share option scheme. A lot of bank employees live in better
houses than they would do otherwise because of the home loan. I don't know
what would happen to that if you were made redundant'.
Ms Fiona Phillips, a national executive member of Bifu who works as a
lending officer in Midland's Macclesfield branch, said: 'It is very
demoralising. This year the bank made a profit and we were all optimistic
and looking forward to a decent pay settlement. Now suddenly the black
clouds of uncertainty are back again.'
Jenny, a cashier in Bath, said: 'I have not been able to concentrate all
day. I don't suppose there is anything we can do to stop it. Everyone who
wanted to take early retirement or redundancy has done so. Anyone still here
really wants to be.'

GENERAL MOTORS, the US carmaker in the throes of a sweeping restructuring,
yesterday announced a return to modest profit after six quarters of red ink,
thanks to lower losses in its core North American vehicle operations.
The company reported first-quarter net income of Dollars 179m (Pounds 101m)
and a sharp improvement on the Dollars 1.1bn loss in the same period last
year before Dollars 942m of non-recurring gains. Sales and revenues rose
from Dollars 29.19bn to Dollars 32.04bn.
Wall Street had forecast a modest loss, although recently the company
appeared to hint at a profit. GM's shares rose Dollars  1/2 to close at
Dollars 40 1/4 .
The figures should help GM over the next few months as it tries to sell
about Dollars 2.3bn of common stock in the largest-ever international share
offering, apart from privatisations.
Mr Robert Stempel, GM chairman, said the Dollars 1.3bn profit turnaround, in
spite of 'a very slow economic recovery in the US', was due mainly to an
improved performance by its North American operations.
GM, and other vehicle manufacturers, has been hit by the US recession and
over-capacity. However, its capacity and productivity problems are more
serious than its rivals and last December Mr Stempel announced restructuring
for North America, involving 70,000 job losses. Earlier this month, GM's
non-executive directors, dissatisfied with the speed of reform, staged a
boardroom coup which clipped Mr Stempel's wings.
The company said North American operations benefited from increased factory
sales, manufacturing cost efficiencies, lower per-unit selling expenses,
material cost reductions and a more profitable product mix.
The company's US dealers sold 1.03m cars and trucks in the first quarter, up
3.6 per cent on 1991.
GM's international vehicle operations had 'continued at strong profit
levels'.
The company's return to profits was helped by improved performances from its
non-vehicle operations, with GH Hughes Electronics earning Dollars 181m (up
from Dollars 97m), Electronic Data Systems making Dollars 133m (Dollars
122m) and General Motors Acceptance Credit, its finance arm, Dollars 354m
(Dollars 306m). Earnings per share on common stock were 2 cents against a
loss of 40 cents.

GRAND Metropolitan, the UK food and drinks group, yesterday took a further
step in the disposal of its Express dairy and foods business with an
agreement to sell Express Foods' Irish dairy interests in a series of deals
worth IPounds 99m (Pounds 90m).
The Express operations in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland,
except for an 80 per cent interest in Carbery Milk Products, are to be sold
to Waterford Foods for IPounds 63m.
In addition, GrandMet will retain ownership of Express Foods Group
(Ireland).
The assets of Express Foods Group (Ireland) will consist of IPounds 15m in
cash and receivables after the deal is completed.
The Express stake in Carbery Milk Products, a Cork-based cheesemaker, is to
be sold for IPounds 21m to Carbery Creameries, a co-operative of dairy
farmers which supply the business with liquid milk.
The businesses being acquired from GrandMet by Waterford are Virginia Milk
Products, Express Northern Foods and WED, an Express Dairies joint venture
with Waterford Co-op.
The deal will make Waterford the leading dairy group in Ireland, with
projected annual sales of IPounds 700m and control over about a fifth of
Ireland's liquid milk output. At present, Waterford has 29 per cent of the
liquid milk market nationally and 72 per cent in Dublin.
Waterford has spent IPounds 215m on acquisitions in the UK, the US and
Ireland since it was floated on the stock market in 1988. It has 25 per cent
of the liquid milk market in the north-west of Britain, 15 per cent of the
UK fruit juice market and 45 per cent of the US condensed milk market.
Yesterday's deals, which are subject to Irish regulatory approval, provide
for Waterford to continue supplying GrandMet with cream for its Bailey's
Original Irish Cream liqueur.
In November, GrandMet sold its Express Dairy and Eden Vale businesses to
Northern Foods for Pounds 359m. The only Express businesses remaining with
GrandMet are the UK cheese and food service operations.
GrandMet decided to sell the Express operations because they do not fit with
its current strategy of focusing on international branded businesses.

FT  29 APR 92 / US economy shows 2% growth in first quarter: Rise in
consumer confidence boosts recovery hopes

REPORTS THAT the US economy grew at an annual rate of 2 per cent in the
first quarter of this year, the fastest pace since the election of President
George Bush early in 1989, boosted hopes yesterday that the country was
firmly on a path to recovery.
Spirits were also lifted by a sharp 8 point rise to 64.8 in a closely
followed index of consumer confidence. Optimism, however, was tempered by
news of a 15 per cent drop in new home sales last month, the sharpest
monthly fall for a decade.
Economists also cautioned that the sectors leading recovery  - personal
consumption and residential investment  - were likely to lose momentum.
Mr Bush, speaking before his convincing victory in yesterday's Pennsylvania
Republican primary, hailed the figures as evidence of recovery. He
acknowledged that some sectors were still hurting but added: 'I think most
people would say 2 per cent growth is not recessionary.'
Mr David Mullins, the Federal Reserve vice-chairman, said the economy was on
course for growth of 3 per cent later this year. This compares with annual
rates of growth of 5-6 per cent in the early stages of most previous US
recoveries.
Mr Michael Boskin, chief White House economist, welcomed the news but said:
'We won't be satisfied with growth rates until the economy achieves the
momentum required to create a steady decline in unemployment.'
Unemployment is 7.3 per cent, the highest level for six years.
The figures for gross domestic product represented a rebound from last
year's fourth quarter, when annual growth dropped to 0.4 per cent, prompting
fears of a 'double dip' recession. The economy has now grown slowly for the
last four successive quarters.
Growth was fuelled mainly by sharp increases in personal consumption and
residential investment, both of which showed signs of flagging towards the
end of the first quarter. The main offsetting factor was a sharp fall in
business inventories.
Most analysts expect growth of 2-3 per cent at an annual rate in the present
quarter, led by a rebound in production as inventories are rebuilt.
Analysts noted, however, that the consumer confidence index would be
expected to rise well above 100 in a healthy recovery.
Sales of new single-family homes fell 14.8 per cent in March to a seasonally
adjusted annual rate of 513,000. Figures for February were also revised
down. The falls wiped out earlier gains, leaving sales only 3 per cent
higher than in last March.
Economists were surprised by the plunge in home sales but said it probably
exaggerated the underlying deterioration in the housing market. Figures for
housing starts and buyer interest were relatively encouraging.

FT  29 APR 92 / Brittan postpones EC car price study
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL

<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SIR LEON BRITTAN, the European Community's competition commissioner,
yesterday postponed publication of his controversial and long-awaited study
of EC car prices for at least a week under pressure from his fellow
commissioners, including Mr Jacques Delors, the Commission president.
Publication of a parallel study of the EC motor industry will almost
certainly go ahead after Mr Martin Bangemann, the industry commissioner,
agreed to make changes to his text.
The wrangling over the two documents is the latest episode in the dispute
between Sir Leon and Mr Bangemann over why car prices differ substantially
across the EC, and how they can be brought into line.
The internal debate in Brussels reflects a fierce Community-wide battle
between manufacturers and consumer groups over the best way of reconciling
an open market in cars and high standards of safety and service.
The study prepared for Sir Leon, the method of which is likely to be
challenged by EC car manufacturers when it appears, indicates that car
prices differ by as much as 40 per cent between some EC countries.
Germany and Spain had the greatest number of high price models in 1988,
while in January 1989 the highest price models were concentrated in the UK.
Spain had by far the greatest number of high price models in the three study
periods in 1990 and 1991.
Sir Leon and Commission competition officials lay most of the blame for the
discrepancies on the 'selective distribution' system of exclusive car
dealerships, which restricts the sales of new cars in the Community to
dealers chosen by the manufacturers. The system, which has also been
attacked by consumer groups, is sheltered from EC competition rules until
1995.
Mr Bangemann and his advisers agree that specific abuses of the system
should be punished, but say there are other reasons for the differences in
prices.
They argue that the exclusive dealership system could be maintained in some
form for a further four years after 1995. This would be partly to protect EC
manufacturers from indirect imports of Japanese cars, which will be allowed
full access to the European market from the end of 1999. It is these
passages which have caused friction with Sir Leon.
'We have offered to take the car price paper a bit later, on the basis that
selective distribution is left neutral in the Bangemann text, so that it
doesn't close any options,' one of Sir Leon's advisers said yesterday.

FT  29 APR 92 / Smith takes strong lead in contest for Labour leadership
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN SMITH, the shadow chancellor, yesterday confirmed his strong head
start in the Labour leadership contest by winning nominations from 162 MPs,
about 60 per cent of the parliamentary party.
His lone rival, Mr Bryan Gould, shadow environment secretary, received 63
votes, narrowly passing the 55 needed to qualify, leaving him a mountain to
climb before the July 18 run-off at a conference of Labour's electoral
college.
The contest for the deputy leadership delivered a surprise when Mrs Margaret
Beckett, widely seen as Mr Smith's 'dream ticket' partner, polled 89 votes
 -markedly lower than expected in what is now a fierce three-way battle.
Mr Gould, who is running for both offices, recorded 69 votes for deputy,
while Mr John Prescott, candidate of the traditional Labour left, was five
votes behind him on 64.
The party's hard-left candidates were trounced, Mr Ken Livingstone's
leadership challenge winning just 13 votes and Mr Bernie Grant, a candidate
for deputy, scoring 15.
Both claimed a ruling that MPs could switch their votes up to yesterday's
5.15pm voting deadline had made them sacrificial victims of what had become
a cynical and stage-managed affair.
The highly controversial preliminary phase of the leadership contest was
also undoubtedly influenced by the last-minute withdrawal of Ms Ann Clwyd,
the party's development spokesman.
She backed out of the contest, amid fresh confusion yesterday morning on
hearing that Members of the European Parliament had not been permitted to
make nominations.
If her claims that she was close to the crucial 55 nominations are even half
correct, the transfer of her votes may have made the difference between
success and failure for Mr Prescott and Mr Gould.
The focus in the election now shifts to the unions, commanding 40 per cent
of the electoral college, and the constituency parties, which, like MPs,
control 30 per cent.
The Nupe public service union yesterday became the first big union to agree
to ballot members on the election.
The EETPU electricians' union decided to seek the opinions of a random
sample of 10,000 members who pay the political levy, and of its delegates to
local Labour parties.
The refusal of several big unions  - particularly the TGWU general union and
the AEU engineering union  - to ballot their members reflects growing
friction between Labour and the unions.

is being a bit overdone? Take yesterday. As Betty Boothroyd, the new

Who is going to be South Africa's next finance minister? More important,
does it matter in the short-term?
The task of piloting the economy of the old South Africa broke Barend du
Plessis  - whose resignation came amid rumours of a nervous breakdown. Over
the past eight years he did a creditable job running an economy under siege
while also presiding over a gradual liberalisation of the country's economic
policies.
His fall from grace over the last couple of years has been dramatic,
however, and his resignation was a recognition of the fact that there was no
place for him in the new South Africa. His relations with the ANC and its
trade union ally Cosatu were far too acrimonious for there to have been any
chance of his being part of a consensus-based government.
Dawie de Villiers, the ex-springbok scrum-half, is probably the only
politician up to the job. But big business would much prefer an apolitical
figure like Derek Keys, the ex-Gencor boss recently appointed Minister of
Trade and Industry and Economic Co-ordination. He also has the big advantage
of being an English speaker.
But combining finance with his current portfolio would probably be too big a
strain even for someone of Key's calibre. If he stays put, Standard Bank
chairman Conrad Strauss, and Harry Schwartz, the ambassador to Washington,
are possibilities.
Given the desperate state of the South African economy, President de Klerk
needs to find a new finance minister who will survive the arrival of an
interim government. Schwartz would fit the bill, although at 68, he is not
young. The cerebral Strauss is highly regarded in banking circles, but
whether the ANC would tolerate for long two unelected businessmen holding
the main economic levers is moot.

Paul Keating, Australia's acid-tongued prime minister, was in fine fettle
yesterday as he took parliamentary questions on his plans to remove the
Union Jack from the Australian flag. Facing a sea of Australian flags
patriotically planted on opposition MPs' desks, Keating labelled his critics
'lickspittlers, crawlers, and snivellers to forces abroad'  - an
uncharacteristically elliptical reference to Britain.
The exchanges marked a new phase in Keating's nationalist campaign, which is
intended to present the opposition conservatives as latter-day colonials.
For the first time, Keating promised to produce detailed proposals for a
replacement flag, although there is no agreement, even within the governing
Labor Party, on what it should look like.
Strangely, there seems to be little support for the most obvious choice  -
replacing the Union Jack with the red, black and yellow Aboriginal flag.
That would imply recognition of 50,000 years of Aborigine history, and might
help Labor in its stated aim of reaching an accord with the descendants of
the continent's original inhabitants.
But perhaps Keating thinks it might not win many votes.

By happy coincidence a speech from the Governor of the Bank of England
criticising companies that combine the jobs of chairman and chief executive
was delivered on the very day that Barclays formally announced it will
continue to do just that.
Andrew Buxton, who takes over as Barclays' chief executive on Friday, will
also become chairman at the end of the year.
Robin Leigh-Pemberton told the IoD that companies should prevent the
concentration and abuse of power, for example by separating 'as a general
rule' the role of chief executive and chairman. 'No-one could seriously
suggest that the current frameworks and arrangements are ideally suited to
the complexities of our current corporate life,' said he.
No-one, that is, except a bank where blood is not considered a disadvantage
to management preferment.

FT  29 APR 92 / Observer: Pitman's finest hour
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It is a very long time since a London clearing bank had an effective chief
executive, rather than an old-style general manager. But Brian Pitman of
Lloyds Bank fits the bill. No other bank chief executive would have had the
guts to challenge the establishment thinking in the way that he has done.
True, Howard Lloyd and Midland's Edward Holden were giant figures a century
ago. But after them it is hard to remember a manager who has had as big an
impact as Pitman. Indeed, what is odd is that he has been permitted to make
such a mark on Lloyds which in the past was more like Barclays with managers
obeying orders and leaving the chairmen to have bright ideas. Ironically, it
was only banks like Midland where managers who had worked their way up from
the bottom were allowed to run the show.
Pitman is unusual amongst his kind in having not only the vision of where he
wanted to take his bank but the ability to persuade both his staff and his
board to follow. Whereas most bankers pride themselves on their lending
skills, Pitman's great strength is his strategic antennae. He also had the
benefit of Sir Jeremy Morse as chairman.
When the chairmanship changes next year, it will be interesting to see how
Pitman's reputation fares in the absence of Morse's restraining hand.

FT  29 APR 92 / Dark horse joins the race: The shape of Lloyds Bank if it
succeeds in taking over Midland
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When Mr Brian Pitman became chief executive of Lloyds Bank in 1983, he asked
his senior colleagues whether the bank was successful. Without exception
they said that it was.
'Research showed we had happy staff and happy customers,' he says. But Mr
Pitman was not satisfied: 'The stock market was saying something completely
different. Lloyds' shares were priced at only 50 per cent of the value of
assets.'
In other words, investors were saying that Lloyds  - like all other banks at
the time  - was relatively inept at managing its assets.
Thereafter, Lloyds became the first big UK bank to be managed primarily for
the benefit of its shareholders  - which Mr Pitman believes is in the
interest of employees and customers as well.
Unlike its rivals, Lloyds became ruthless at pulling out of businesses
making a low return, and began to cut costs. In 1991 alone, Lloyds cut
Pounds 150m from its staff costs by reducing its headcount by 8,500.
Thus Lloyds' attempt to take over Midland is aimed at pushing up profits by
cutting costs. 'By integrating the two businesses, Lloyds Bank envisages it
could reduce the enlarged group's operating costs by over Pounds 700m within
four years of the merger,' it said yesterday.
This focus on productivity is in stark contrast to the pronouncements of
most other banks when making takeover bids. Banks traditionally believe that
big is beautiful and promote their takeover attempts by pointing to the
benefits of expanding the network of offices. Never before has a UK clearing
bank attempted to acquire a UK rival against the rival's will.
This has been the message of Hongkong &amp; Shanghai Banking Corporation, which
made a formal takeover offer for Midland a fortnight ago. The logic of its
offer is that it creates 'a strong international banking group with a
worldwide network . . . operating in the world's three major economic
regions'.
Because Hongkong Bank has a relatively modest presence in the UK, it has
little scope to improve profits by cutting operations which overlap with
those of Midland.
Lloyds has much more scope for such gains. Mr Pitman says the Pounds 700m
savings arising from the planned takeover of Midland should be achieved
relatively easily  - and may be exceeded.
He also talks confidently of increasing Midland's income. The most obvious
way of pushing up profits at Midland would be for Lloyds' life insurance
subsidiary, Abbey Life, to sell its products to Midland's customers. Mr
Pitman says that last year 14 per cent of all Lloyds customers who bought
any life insurance at all bought their policies from Lloyds Abbey Life  -
far higher than the percentage of Midland customers buying their insurance
from Midland.
Persuading Midland customers to buy Lloyds Abbey Life products could bring
in many tens of million pounds of extra profit over the next few years.
But in the short term Lloyds' emphasis would be on cost savings, which would
be made by reorganising three different parts of the combined banks'
activities:
Overlapping elements of head office functions and centralised services -
such as foreign exchange and money market dealing  - would be eliminated.
A single computer network would be operated for the enlarged operation.
Where Lloyds and Midland have adjacent branches, one of the branches would
be closed.
Over four years Lloyds would expect to shed 20,000 employees from the
combined banks' worldwide staff of 125,500, with the bulk of the job losses
occurring in the UK. The banking union, Bifu, is concerned this would
involve huge numbers of forced redundancies.
But Mr Pitman says 'forced redundancies are very unlikely . . . Many of
those jobs will go through natural wastage. The rest are likely to accept
voluntary severance.'
To cover these severance costs, Lloyds would make a provision of Pounds 300m
before tax out of reorganisation costs totalling Pounds 550m.
The greatest source of long-term cost savings, about half of the Pounds
700m, should come from reorganising the branch network. Mr Pitman says some
1,000 branches would close over four years.
'Where there are overlapping branches, we will close the weaker branch,' he
says. 'That may mean closing a Lloyds branch rather than a Midland one.' Sir
Jeremy Morse, Lloyds chairman, says this equity of treatment between the two
banks' branches has been spelled out clearly to Lloyds employees.
Mr Pitman insists customers will benefit from an orderly re-organisation of
this sort rather than the more haphazard restructuring of the industry which
is currently taking place: 'I believe that over the next decade around
10,000 bank and building society branches in the UK, out of the total number
of 20,000, will close. That will involve the loss of 50,000 jobs.'
Sir Jeremy argues that the way the cuts fall can hurt customers. There are
some villages and towns which now have no bank branches at all, he says,
where until recently each clearing bank had a branch. 'Everyone pulled out
at the same time, where in fact it would have been better for customers if
one of us had stayed behind,' he says.
His argument is that Lloyds and Midland as independent banks would close
down just as many branches over the next few years as the 1,000 planned by
Lloyds if it buys Midland. The difference is that if Lloyds succeeds with
its bid, it would continue to be represented in all areas where the two
banks are represented. Only overlapping branches would be closed.
Nonetheless, Lloyds and Midland customers in some parts of the country would
experience disruption to service. Each bank has large numbers of banks in
the Midlands  - both Lloyds and Midland were founded in Birmingham  - and in
South Wales, so closures will be greatest in these regions.
The two banks are a good match in terms of the regional distribution of
branches, with Lloyds stronger in the south and Midland in the north.
Earlier in the 20th century, Lloyds concentrated its expansion on the south
and south west, by buying the Wilts and Dorset Bank in 1914 and Capital and
Counties Bank in 1918. Midland by contrast grew in Britain's industrial
heartland.
But branch closure is not the only inconvenience to be faced by Midland's
3.6m current account holders. They would be asked to give up their Midland
cheque books and plastic cards for Lloyds ones.
However, Lloyds would abandon only the 'Midland' brand name. Other marques
 -such as the First Direct brand used by Midland's branchless banking
subsidiary and Samuel Montagu, the name of its merchant bank  - would be
kept.
Both banks' big corporate customers are indifferent to the prospect of
Midland being bought by Lloyds. Big companies' closest relationships tend to
be with National Westminster and Barclays, rather than with Midland and
Lloyds. For services or loans, big groups shop around at the big
international banks too.
However, there is one group of the banks' customers, small and medium size
businesses, which is more concerned about the implications of such a deal.
Though there are a dozen financial institutions providing loans to such
businesses, this market is dominated by the four English clearing banks.
According to industry sources, NatWest has about 28 per cent of this market,
Barclays 27 per cent, Lloyds 15 per cent and Midland 14 per cent. Small
businesses fear that the combination of Lloyds and Midland would be bad for
competition.
Mr Pitman claims the opposite is true. 'We would for the first time be on an
equal footing with NatWest and Barclays,' he says. 'We would compete more
effectively.' He also points out that in most European countries, banking
markets are dominated by just two or perhaps three banks, rather than four
as in the UK.
LLoyds may be able to go some way to reassuring small business customers and
personal clients that they will enjoy benefits from a Midland takeover. Mr
Pitman says in the coming weeks Lloyds will offer new products and services
unavailable elsewhere, to its and Midland's customers, conditional on the
deal going through.
The aim would be to prove that some of the extra profits generated from
buying Midland would be recycled into improving services to customers. In
this way, Lloyds also hopes to persuade the UK and Brussels competition
authorities that a Midland takeover is in the public interest.
Lloyds has made it explicit that it regards the competition authorities as
the main obstacle to such a takeover. Though it has said how much it would
offer for each Midland share  - one of its own shares plus 30p  - it also
said it would not offer this formally until one of two preconditions has
been met:
Either it must be satisfied that its bid will not be referred for
investigation by the UK competition authority, the Monopolies and Mergers
Commission;
Or if its bid is referred to the monopolies commission, then the rival offer
from Hongkong Bank should also be referred.
What it wants, in Sir Jeremy's words, is 'a level playing field' in its
fight against Hongkong Bank. If its bid went to the monopolies commission
but Hongkong Bank's did not, Midland's shareholders would have to choose
between accepting an immediate offer from Hongkong Bank or waiting between
three and six months for the outcome of the commission's investigation.
Lloyds fears that under such circumstances, shareholders would take the
immediately available offer.
Staff of the Office of Fair Trading, which would advise the Department of
Trade and Industry (DTI) on whether to refer a bid to the monopolies
commission, say the Lloyds' bid will almost certainly be referred. This
means, they say, that Lloyds' only hope is that the Hongkong Bank bid is
referred to the commission as well.
The likelihood of such a reference is difficult to assess. First, the
Brussels competition authorities need to be persuaded that the Hongkong bid
falls outside their jurisdiction. Then, Lloyds needs to persuade the OFT and
the DTI that there are grounds for a reference of the Hongkong bid to the
commission. Lloyds privately admits that this will be a challenge.
Still, the potential gains from a successful bid for Midland justify the
efforts involved. Mr Pitman's strategy of building Lloyds' profits by
shrinking the bank has worked very successfully; but it cannot continue
indefinitely. To keep its profits growing, Lloyds needs fresh costs to cut.
Midland offers the best place to find them  - and therefore the best
opportunity of keeping Lloyds' shareholders happy.

By January 1993 European air transport will be largely liberalised if not
deregulated. Airlines will be free to fly anywhere within the Community at
whatever fares they wish to charge.
The protagonists of liberalisation argued that a more competitive
environment would push down fares, in turn forcing airlines to reduce costs
and improve efficiency. Without state aid, banned under the Community's
rules, only the efficient would survive. New airlines would come in to
challenge those established national carriers operating cosy duopolies on
the main routes. Consumers would benefit from a wide choice of products and
from lower fares. That is the expectation. What is the reality?
Experience of deregulation in the US showed that airlines had to be big to
survive in a more competitive marketplace. Size does not generate cost
economies but does offer powerful marketing advantages. Some European
airlines were quick to grasp this. They set out to enlarge their scale of
operations by buying domestic competitors or by purchasing shares in foreign
airlines to gain greater marketing spread. Examples include Air France,
which in 1990 took a majority holding in UTA, France's large independent
carrier, which also gave it control of the leading domestic operator, Air
Inter. At the same time several airlines established strong marketing
alliances: Air France with Lufthansa, and Iberia with Alitalia.
During this first stage of airline concentration most of the independent
scheduled carriers in Europe have been swallowed up or have lost their
independence. With the exception of Virgin, no independent airlines of any
importance survive. The next stage will see a number of the smaller national
carriers disappear or become subsidiaries. Sabena was the first in April,
when it signed a partnership agreement allowing Air France to acquire 37.5
per cent of its shares.
In time some of the larger European airlines will begin to merge, as KLM and
British Airways almost did earlier this year. By 1995 the four or five
largest airlines will control 75-80 per cent of the Community's scheduled
air traffic. Air France, British Airways and Lufthansa will be among them.
As had been expected, liberalisation encouraged Europe's charter airlines to
launch competitive scheduled services. But by 1990 most of them began to
realise that the costs of mounting scheduled services were higher than
anticipated. They rapidly reduced their scheduled operations. Air Europe,
which by 1990 was operating 15 scheduled routes, collapsed in February 1991.
The impact of liberalisation on fares has been mixed. On most intra-European
routes little has changed. They are operated in most cases by two airlines,
one from each end of the route, charging similar fares. Only on a few routes
have fares gone down appreciably, usually when smaller independent airlines
have entered previously controlled markets. Between London and Dublin the
entry of Ryanair in 1985 pushed average fares down by about a third. In
fact, yields have been so low that British Airways pulled out of this route
early in 1991. But such markets have been the exception: too frequently new
entrants charge fares similar to the established carriers. Dan Air, which
launched a London-Athens service this year, is doing just that.
In a deregulated market, downward pressure on fares is more likely to come
from new entrants. But it will not be easy for new airlines to enter the
busiest markets.
A growing number of European airports are desperately short of runway
capacity, especially at peak periods. To launch its Heathrow-Brussels
services this year British Midland had to abandon its flights to Liverpool
in order to free convenient slots.
Within the single European market, competition should take place on a level
playing field. This means no direct or indirect state subsidies to airlines.
But recent decisions by the Commission in approving government aid to Sabena
and Air France has made the playing field very bumpy. A large capital
injection of FFr2bn (Pounds 203m) by the French government in Air France was
approved by the Commission on the grounds that it was a commercially
justifiable decision which would equally have been made by a private
investor. A huge cash injection in Iberia by the state-owned holding
company, INI, is likely to be condoned on the same grounds.
The aim of liberalisation has been to increase competition in order to
produce lower fares and greater choice for passengers. But the European
Commission seems powerless to prevent the emergence of a small number of
European mega-carriers, which will dominate European markets. They are
likely to ensure, through tacit collusion on fares and control of runway
slots, that consumers do not enjoy the full benefits of competition.

FT  29 APR 92 / Jobs: The main reasons why so many want out - Study of
workers intending to move reveals disheartening view of employers' concern
for people
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL DIXON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHAT makes people decide to go to a new employer? The question is prompted
by something the Jobs column first reported three weeks ago while discussing
the recession's effect on British workers' attitudes as shown by two surveys
made by the Wyatt consultancy, the original in 1988 and a follow-up late
last year.
One of the most striking changes since the good times of 1988 - and the one
I'm particularly concerned with - is a sharp rise in the proportion of
people intending to find a new job as soon as the employment market allows.
But as not everyone reading today will have been in the congregation three
weeks back, I had better recall the context in which the said rise occurred.
The main surprise of the findings was of the cheery sort. Admittedly, the
out-of-work were excluded, both studies being confined to people with
full-time jobs, over 3,000 the first time and 800-plus in the follow-up.
Among those who had survived the recession employed, however, morale had
improved between the two surveys.
There were several signs of a general feeling that cut-backs had left
organisations fitter to profit from economic revival. Almost four fifths,
compared with three in five before, felt that the quality of their employing
concern's products was good, and 57 per cent compared with 45 said that they
would re-commend it to other people as a place to work. Personal
satisfaction with the job was reported by two thirds, as against 59 per
cent.
What bugged me, however, was that at the same time the share intent on
changing employers had leapt from 13 per cent to 23. So borrowing Wyatt's
breakdowns of the responses to the 99 survey questions, I began examining
why so many recession-pounded people should itch to be up and away.
The first thing they called to mind was that maxim of the 1914-18 trenches:
'If you knows of a better 'ole, go to it.' Clearly, while folk wanting out
in such circumstances must be dissatisfied where they are, their urge can be
either positively or negatively motivated.
In the positive case, the new hole is sought because it is en-visaged as
better in being not just more congenial, but favourably sited for personal
advance. In the negative case, the sole reason for seeking the new hole is
the belief that a blockbuster is going to land on the present one any
minute.
Accordingly, I picked out of the consultancy's data three topics on which
dissatisfaction would seem apt to give people the positive idea that they'd
do better elsewhere. The trio are the opportunities for promotion in the
present outfit, its record in selecting the right people to promote, and the
pay it provides by comparison with the rates for similar work in other
outfits. I also chose one negative spur: anxiety about the longer-term
security of the existing job.
The result is the table alongside which, for each of the four topics,
compares the percentages declaring themselves unhappy most recently with
those who did likewise in 1988, together with the shares intending to move.
After giving the overall figures at the top, the table breaks them down by
sex, age, length of time with the current organisation, and its sector of
activity.
As may be seen, on the first positive prompter - opportunities for promotion
 -dissatisfaction largely worsened between the two dates. Only in three
cases was there an opposite swing: people with three to five years' service,
and in central government and state-owned operations such as British Rail
and public education.
Even so, opinions on employers' propensity to promote the right people
shifted the other way. An improvement was registered in all groups except
manufacturing and 'other service' employees showing no change, and 16- to
24-year-olds and those with five to 10 years service who saw things as
worse.
Much the same applied also to views on pay-levels as compared with rates
elsewhere. All showed at least some improvement apart from manufacturing
folk, again with no change, and four opposite movers: the 45-54 age group,
those with 10-20 years service, and local government and other service
staff.
Hence it appears that, on the whole, my three positive pointers contributed
at best very little to the increase in intentions to be up and off. But
there's no ambivalence whatever on the negative pointer. Anxiety about
current job security has risen all round  - suggesting that the main appeal
of a new hole nowadays is less the expectation of its being better than the
belief that it could hardly be worse.
Moreover, that interpretation is confirmed by a special study kindly made by
Wyatt of all the ways in which the people intent on moving differed from
those who were not. Besides feeling less secure in their present post,
markedly more of the would-be leavers viewed their workplace's procedures as
not making sense, let alone allowing them to do their job well. They also
saw their organisation as quite the reverse of interested in its employees'
well being, or in treating them with respect and dignity, or in giving them
chances to use their particular skills.
In short, the main factors linked with the wanderlust are thoroughly
negative. So the fact that the latest survey showed nearly a quarter of
workers wanting out, is something of which Britain's employers surely ought
to be ashamed.

FT  29 APR 92 / Lib Dems aiming for council gains
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Liberal Democrat party yesterday launched its campaign for the local
council elections, hoping to capitalise on its success at Bath in the
general election, where Mr Chris Patten, the Tory party chairman, was
unseated.
Senior party officials predicted significant gains in next Thursday's
contest, particularly among what they perceived as hesitant Tory voters in
the general election who were likely to switch sides.
Mr Paddy Ashdown, party leader, said the government had benefited from
'people with their coat collars turned up furtively voting Conservative' in
the general election. The Liberal Democrats would build on their successes
in last year's local elections, he said.
Mr Simon Hughes, environment spokesman, said: 'Some people who possibly feel
a bit guilty about voting Conservative at the general election will try to
reverse that at the local elections.'
The Liberal Democrats are defending several council seats it won in 1988  -
a bad year for the party which was suffering from the disruption caused by
the merger of the former Alliance parties.
Although the number of council seats up for election is relatively small,
party strategists are looking to increase the number of Liberal Democrat
councillors from 3,750 to more than 3,800.
Other target areas for the party include Colchester, Harrogate, and
Winchester.
Mr Ashdown said the general election had shown that 'Liberal Democrats are
on a rising curve, Labour are on a falling curve.'
The party's local-election manifesto stresses the Liberal Democrats'
commitment to providing efficient local services and improving local
democracy and accounta-bility.
It pledges that Liberal Democrat councils would listen to the views of local
people through surveys and public question times.
The manifesto also pledges that proportional representation would be
introduced for elections in the control of local authorities.
Council nominations to outside bodies would be in pro-portion to local
political strength.

FT  29 APR 92 / Bank Governor urges check on corporate abuses: Institute of
Directors Convention
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD EVANS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Robin Leigh-Pemberton, governor of the Bank of England, yesterday
advocated a cautious, 'plural' approach by the City to ensure that there was
no repetition of the recent spate of corporate abuses and failures.
He told the Institute of Directors annual convention at the Royal Albert
Hall in London: 'You will not find me a supporter of a blockbusting or
portmanteau solution to the Maxwell kind of problem, but you will find me
encouraging and promoting the plural approach to try to get the right
balance between sensible safeguards and freedom to take legitimate risks.'
Proper corporate accountability required mechanisms for checks and balances
to prevent a concentration and abuse of power, 'for example, separation as a
general rule of the role of chief executive and chairman, the appointment of
independent directors, the setting up of audit committees'.
Although he recognised that not all industrialists agreed with these
prescriptions, he said: 'No one could seriously suggest that the current
framework and arrangements are ideally suited to the complexities of our
current corporate life.'
He added: 'In my view, the onus is on the opponents of the tide for change
to say what they would do about the abuses and failures.'
Mr Leigh-Pemberton said he did not accept the view that the Maxwell case was
a failure of self-regulation, and by inference that this should be replaced
by a new official bureaucracy.
The chain of laws and agencies which dealt with aspects of the Maxwell
affair combined a mixture of criminal and civil law, official regulation and
self-regulation, and the case did not make a good object lesson one way or
another.
He said the authorities could create various safeguards, but they would
never be able to construct a fail-safe system to prevent fraud.
The price of freedom for individuals and for enterprises seeking to be
successful was eternal vigilance, not eternal reporting. 'To stifle economic
enterprise by too much control would be a disastrous over-reaction,' Mr
Leigh-Pemberton said.
What had to be done was to make roles clearer. He added: 'We also need to
become clearer about precisely what can be expected of regulators and what
can be done to safeguard the independence of non-executive directors,
accountants and other guardians of proper behaviour, so very powerful
individuals face similarly powerful obstacles to attempts to abuse their
position.'

FT  29 APR 92 / Volkswagen chief seeks change in employer attitudes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DRASTIC CHANGES will be required in long-standing attitudes governing
industrial relations if European economies are to prosper, Dr Carl Hahn,
chairman of Volkswagen, told the conference.
Dr Hahn, whose company this week faces the prospect of strikes, said the
Marxist concept of a fundamental gulf between labour and capital had been
consigned to 'the dustbin of history'. But employers had yet to dismantle
the old demarcations and divisions which still characterised the workforce.
He said the internal world of the company could no longer be one of
'upstairs and downstairs'. In all divisions and at all levels of corporate
life, entirely new attitudes and qualifications were needed if businesses
were to meet successfully the increasingly complex challenges confronting
them.
Employers, Dr Hahn stressed, had to create a climate in their companies
which permitted all staff to contribute to the success of the business.
The best solution to harmonious progress was to bring all workers closer to
the creation and management of resources and to imbue them with a sense of
ownership through increased participation and responsibility.
Dr Hahn said the biggest challenge facing Europe was to spread capitalist
principles across the continent.
The liberated peoples of central and eastern Europe had to be given hope and
must not be allowed to begin to yearn for a return to the old days of
communism.
It was politically essential that examples demonstrating the benefits of the
western system were established in formerly communist central Europe without
delay.
It was 'the perfect place to build bridges, across which knowhow and capital
can flow still further eastwards'.

FT  29 APR 92 / Tide of relief greets Major
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT HAD been a very close-run thing, Mr Peter Morgan, director-general of the
IoD, told the 2,500 people attending the institute's 43rd annual convention,
Michael Cassell writes.
They hardly needed reminding that their victory rally, following the Tories'
fourth consecutive election victory, could just as easily have been a wake.
The prospect of Mr John Smith with his hands deep in the pockets of the
well-paid and of his sidekick Mr Gordon Brown barging into boardrooms all
over the country had been very real when delegates were booking their Pounds
120-a-head places.
The IoD was well-prepared for the worst. If Labour had won, the smoked
salmon timbale in the famous luncheon hampers was unlikely to have been
replaced with a prawn cocktail. But Mr Neil Kinnock would certainly have
been asked to make yesterday's keynote speech.
His performance would have been unlikely to provoke the enraptured response
he won at his triumphalist Sheffield gathering a month ago.
'He would have been lucky to get back to his seat before the applause
stopped,' said Mr Jerry Hughes, a Black Country finance director.
In the event, Mr John Major emerged, almost sheepishly, from behind a black
curtain to reassure his audience that everything was really going to be all
right.
Mr Major, it seems, was invited to speak to the IoD when he became foreign
secretary but was moved on before he could keep the date. He was invited
again as chancellor but was once more moved. This time, he was still in the
job as prime minister and seemed to find the situation quite satisfactory.
So did his audience. Behind evident surprise and relief there was a warm
welcome for Mr Major's pledge to complete Mrs Thatcher's trade union reforms
and to keep a wary eye on Brussels.
There was, above all, widespread enthusiasm for the prospect of a period of
political stability and of an end to the recession. Recovery, the prime
minister said, had been waiting in the wings and a return of confidence
would now speed up the revival.
Few in the audience, however, were yet prepared to say the recession was
over. Sir Nigel Mobbs, chairman of Slough Estates, said most businessmen
would be encouraged by Mr Major's bullish appraisal of prospects for
economic recovery. 'We cannot expect it all to happen within weeks of an
election victory,' he said. 'But we have averted a national disaster.'
Few of the captains of industry would have disagreed.

FT  29 APR 92 / Rolls decline at independent schools
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PUPIL NUMBERS at independent schools have fallen for the first time in nine
years, with boarding schools bearing the brunt of the decline, according to
figures released yesterday by the Independent Schools Information Service.
The survey shows that fees have risen an average 12 per cent from last year
 - nearly three times the rate of inflation  - taking average boarding fees
to Pounds 8,625 a year and day fees to Pounds 3,774. Fees at Headmasters'
Conference schools, the independent sector's elite, average Pounds 9,522 a
year for boarders and Pounds 4,014 for day pupils.
The number of private-school pupils fell only 0.2 per cent. In January
475,288 pupils were attending 1,364 schools affiliated to the information
service. The number of boarding pupils is sharply down  - by 4 per cent on
the year, making a total fall of nearly 11 per cent in three years.
Girls' schools and prep schools are hardest hit. The number of boarders at
the 243 schools affiliated to the Girls' Schools Association fell 4.9 per
cent, and there was a 6.4 per cent fall at the 523 members of the
Association of Preparatory Schools.
Mr David Woodhead, director of the information service, said the survey
showed the resilience of independent schools in the trough of recession.
According to the survey almost a quarter of pupils receive help with fees  -
a 6.4 per cent rise on last year  - with most of the help coming from
schools themselves.
Mr John Patten, education secretary, yesterday launched a drive to recruit
75,000 school governors amid concern about the unwillingness of professional
people to take on the increasingly onerous duty of overseeing and managing
schools.
The current demand for governors is caused by the ending later this year of
the four-year terms of governors appointed after the 1988 Education Reform
Act.
Launching a nationwide 'Schools Need Governors' campaign in London, Mr
Patten urged the business and education communities to make common cause in
the running of schools.

FT  29 APR 92 / Plea to end cycle of 'boom and bust'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A PLEA to the government to avoid the 'roller-coaster of boom and bust' and
to provide the conditions for steady and sustained economic recovery was
made by Mr Peter Morgan, director-general of the IoD.
Mr Morgan told the conference the government had a role to play in securing
renewed economic growth over the next few years and in providing business
with a chance to respond to the 'critical chorus of closet collectivists'
who questioned the motives of the marketplace.
The general election had represented a 'day of reckoning', not only for the
politicians but also for capitalism.
The eventual outcome, he said, had been a 'near thing', with a real
possibility that the voters would elect a which was government committed to
transfer power away from the market and the consumer and back to government
and the unions.
Those who believed in capitalism and the markets, he added, would never be
able to relax in the fight to prove that they were worthy custodians of
economic power. If they did, they could lose next time.
Responding to the continuing criticism of big pay rises for executives, Mr
Morgan said the IoD had 'no reservations' about substantial earnings by top
performers at the peak of their profession. But it did not support the abuse
of executive power.
He added: 'Unless directors are scrupulous in this respect, capitalism
generally and directors in particular will always be vulnerable to
criticism.'
Mr Morgan said the IoD had consistently recommended that top executive
rewards and performance payments should be independently determined and
clearly reported.
Shareholders and the public needed to see and understand the connection
between directors' pay and directors' performance.

FT  29 APR 92 / Strength of recovery uncertain: CBI Industrial trends survey
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Confederation of British Industry yesterday gave an upbeat view of
prospects for manufacturers later this year, but warned that the timing and
strength of the expected recovery was uncertain.
The assessment came in the CBI's latest quarterly survey of industry trends,
conducted among 1,328 manufacturing companies in 50 sectors between March 27
and April 13. Of the total responses, 94 per cent were filed before the
general election result.
The survey said output and orders had continued to fall in the past four
months, but more slowly than last year. Business optimism had shown its
biggest jump for nearly four years, supporting indications of a hesitant
upturn.
Factors that could hold back the recovery included slow world growth, which
could dampen export demand, high company and consumer debts, and a
continuation of high interest rates caused by the UK's commitment to the
European exchange rate mechanism.
Another negative aspect was reduced spending on manufacturing investment.
The CBI believes this will fall by about a third by the end of this year
compared with late 1990  - before the onset of the UK recession.
This is not the first time the CBI's quarterly survey has pointed to
recovery. Last October it provided similar indications about an imminent
upturn, a message which turned out to be false.
Mr Andrew Sentance, the CBI's director of economics, said the latest survey
gave stronger reasons for believing a revival was on the way. 'It is giving
us the strongest indications for two years about the future levels of orders
and output,' he said.
A quarter of the companies in the survey said they were more optimistic
about the next four months, with 17 per cent more pessimistic. The balance
expressing optimism of 8 per cent compared with a negative balance of 24 per
cent in January, and a positive balance of 2 per cent in October last year.
A balance of 5 per cent of companies believe output will rise over the next
four months, compared with a negative balance of 4 per cent in January. In
the four months to April demand for new orders continued to fall, but at the
slowest rate since January 1990.
Increases in unit costs are running at their lowest rate since the survey
was launched in 1958, indicating that companies are benefiting from low
prices charged by suppliers and reduced wage claims.
Pressure to cut prices remains strong, though it is slightly weaker than in
the January survey. A balance of 5 per cent of companies is reducing prices
of goods for the UK market, compared with 19 per cent in January.
A balance of 8 per cent said export orders had declined in the past four
months, compared with 16 per cent in January and 20 per cent in October last
year.
The manufacturing workforce is expected to shrink by 44,000 in the second
quarter, compared with 62,000 in the first quarter.

FT  29 APR 92 / Fall expected in lending to property groups
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER, Property Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BANK LENDING to property companies, which stands at a record Pounds 39.2bn,
will decline at a rate of Pounds 2bn a year for the next four years,
according to research by Savills, the firm of chartered surveyors.
This heavy debt burden is one of the severest problems facing the property
industry, which is suffering its biggest decline for 50 years.
In spite of a marginal decline from a peak of Pounds 40.7bn last May to
Pounds 39.2bn, property debt is, in real terms, more than three times what
it was in 1974  - the year of the last property crash. If construction
companies are included in the figures, property lending totals Pounds 55bn.
The UK property sector raised Pounds 3.9bn in new funds last year, a 4 per
cent decline on 1990.
Nearly half the new funds came from a record number of rights issues by
property companies, which raised Pounds 2.03bn. The remainder of the new
funds came from Pounds 1.5bn of loans and Pounds 450m through bonds. Most of
the new funds were used to refinance existing debts.
Leaving aside a total of Pounds 250m that was raised by housing
associations, just Pounds 780m was left as 'new' money for the industry.
Net institutional investment increased from Pounds 1.3bn to Pounds 2.2bn
last year, according to government statistics.
However, figures from the Investment Property Databank, an independent
research group, indicate a fall in net investment to just under Pounds 1bn
last year.
In the first quarter of this year very little new money was raised by the
property industry as a result of a weak stock market and the uncertainty
surrounding the general election.
The UK clearing banks will need to make provisions of Pounds 3.5bn to Pounds
4bn against their property loans, according to County NatWest, the merchant
banking arm of National Westminster Bank.
The clearing banks have a property exposure of Pounds 17.2bn.
County NatWest expects the banks to recognise the losses over a number of
years, during which time they will tend to support distressed companies.
County's chief concern is directed at the attitude of overseas lenders,
particularly as a result of the decline in the Japanese property and equity
markets.

FT  29 APR 92 / The world begins to believe in sterling: Currency rises
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH and JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STERLING has proved one of the main beneficiaries of the Conservatives'
election victory.
Since early April the pound has gained more than 10 pfennigs against the
D-Mark. The rise is a result of the biggest sustained burst of international
support for sterling since Britain joined the European exchange rate
mechanism 19 months ago.
Yesterday sterling closed in London at DM2.9375, unchanged on the day, just
more than 1 pfennig below its central ERM rate of DM2.95.
Behind the rise  - which has lifted sterling from a low of DM2.835 on April
4  - are investors from Japan, Germany and the US who interpret the Tories'
election win as underlining Britain's commitment to the ERM.
The rise removed nagging doubts that a new government might devalue the
pound within the 10-currency grid as part of an attempt to engineer a
reduction in the high level of UK interest rates.
It caused international investors  - many of which had avoided sterling
purchases during pre-election uncertainty  - to move funds out of currencies
such as the D-Mark and the dollar and into sterling.
One side-effect of the stronger pound has been to help the government sell
about Pounds 4bn of gilt-edged securities in recent weeks  - up to about a
half are believed to have gone to overseas buyers.
A second factor helping sterling is that many in financial markets believe
that over the next few months Britain will move sterling from its broad 6
per cent band in the ERM to join the majority of nations in the system whose
currencies are held in narrow 2.25 per cent bands. This should reduce still
more the possibility of any sharp falls in sterling, and is seen as further
reason to buy.
Third, recent economic evidence pointing to a weak UK economic recovery
later this year is also helping to increase confidence in the pound.
Fourth, the government appears to be in no hurry to cut base rates, held at
10.5 per cent since September. That gives investors another reason to buy
sterling.
Finally, sterling has benefited from the negative view many investors have
taken about the economic and political prospects of other nations -
including Germany, France and Italy  - leading to a tendency to switch funds
out of the currencies of those countries and into the UK's.
But in some senses the pound's increase in value has simply corrected for
its fragility before the election, when it was the weakest member of the ERM
grid. It is now fourth from bottom, above the Danish krone, the French franc
and the Italian lire.
Also, investor sentiment could easily switch from sterling, in the event of
unsettling factors such as a burst of inflation.
A sudden rise in German borrowing rates, which set the climate for monetary
policy throughout Europe via the ERM link, could cause investors to sell
sterling. Another important factor could be any deterioration in the UK's
trade deficit over the coming months.
Perhaps the best way of looking at sterling is to consider the difference
between the yields on UK gilts and the equivalent government bonds issued by
Germany. That underlines the difference in sentiment towards the pound
compared with the D-Mark, which is the ERM anchor because of its record as
the system's most stable currency.
Before the election, 10-year gilts had yields a full 2 percentage points
higher than the corresponding German bonds  - indicating the extra payment
demanded by international investors for holding sterling assets as opposed
to those denominated in D-Marks.
After sterling's recent rise  - and a similar increase in gilt prices,
paralleled by a decline in yields  - the yield gap has been brought down,
but only to about 1.4 percentage points.
Some gilt specialists reckon this will decline further to about 1.2
percentage points by the end of 1992. The difference is still substantial  -
reinforcing the distance the pound has to travel before it is regarded on
financial markets as being anything like such a good bet as the German
currency.

FT  29 APR 92 / Seven are accused of stamps swindle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STAMP COLLECTORS were the victims of a swindle involving the manufacture of
stamps for colonial governments with deliberate printing imperfections,
Southwark Crown Court was told yesterday.
Commemorative stamps printed with errors such as wrong colouring, inverted
watermarks and faulty perforations, included some issued to mark the wedding
of the Duke and Duchess of York in 1986, the jury heard.
Some stamps produced to mark the Queen's 40th wedding anniversary were
printed with an inverted picture. A set to celebrate the wedding of the
Prince and Princess of Wales in 1981 rose in value from Pounds 7.50 to
Pounds 70 because it had been marked with the word 'specimen'.
Opening the prosecution against seven businessmen, Mr Michael Worsley QC
said collectors had been willing to pay for the rarity value of such stamps,
which they had been told had slipped through the normal checking procedures.
'They thought they were buying a genuine mistake by the printers and were
paying a price based on that. They were being deceived,' Mr Worsley said.
The defendants deny various charges including conspiracy to defraud and
fraudulent trading between October 1985 and July 1989.
The defendants are Mr Clive Harold Feigenbaum, a former chairman of Stanley
Gibbons, the stamp dealers; Mr Aart Johan Lagerwaard and Mr Ronald Wallen,
both stamp dealers from Southampton; Mr Frederick George Hughes of Thornton
Heath, south London; Mr Ronald Frederick Grover of Beaulieu, Hants; Mr Brian
Pillinger, managing director of Bristol stamp dealers Urch Harris and Mr
John Charles Smith, a director of the Crown Agents Stamp Company.
Mr Feigenbaum was the 'mastermind' behind the swindle, Mr Worsley suggested.
He owned Format International, the printing business which carried out the
work and which was at the centre of any fraud. He also owned two other stamp
dealing businesses involved in selling the bogus stamps to collectors.
When police searched various premises they found enormous quantities of the
bogus stamps along with bags full of instructions to the printers.
The fraud involved an enormous trade in the bogus collectors items, Mr
Worsley said. Had all the stamps to be produced in court been sold at
catalogue value, then philatelists would have been defrauded of tens of
millions of pounds.
The case continues today.

   WESTMINSTER gave birth to a new think tank last night
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
the first to link a pro-EC stance with the market-led economic philosophy of
Thatcherism.
President of the European Policy Forum is Mr Graham Mather, who recently
quit after five years as director-general of the right-wing Institute of
Economic Affairs over political differences with the IEA's Euro-sceptic
founders.
The forum, chaired by Lord Hunt of Tanworth, a cabinet secretary to four
prime ministers, is described as 'a non-partisan combination of discussion
forum, channel for international contacts and think tank'.
Membership of its governing council crosses a wide range of political
territory. It includes Lord Alexander, chairman of National Westminster
Bank, Sir Christopher Tugendhat, former Tory EC commissioner, Lord Holme,
leading Liberal Democrat policy adviser, Sir Roy Denman, former EC
ambassador to Washington, Mr Goron Tunhammar, president of the Swedish
employers' federation, Mr Samuel Brittan, an assistant editor of the
Financial Times, and Mr Martin Jacques, former editor of Marxism Today.
Launching the forum at its Queen Anne's Gate offices last night, Lord Hunt
told an audience which included Mr John Major, the prime minister, that the
Maastricht treaty  - while a great achievement  - had prompted concern about
an overly centralist Community that raised new challenges. 'This does not
mean a retreat into Euro-scepticism, but rather finding the right way
forward,' he said.
He added that the forum had received non-partisan support, including
finance, from across Europe.
The forum was also welcomed by Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary. 'I
look forward eagerly to pungent and stimulating contributions to debate from
the European Policy Forum,' he said.
While the forum stresses the catholic nature of its support, it will focus
on deregulation and the transformation of public services.
Mr Frank Vibert is also joining from the IEA as a director.

FT  29 APR 92 / Lloyd's council to discuss help for Names
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE COUNCIL of Lloyd's of London, the insurance market's ruling body, will
today discuss a plan to help Names worst affected by recent insurance
losses.
Several hundred Names  - whose assets provide the market's capital base  -
face bankruptcy as a result of losses in the 1989 underwriting year.
Mr David Coleridge, Lloyd's chairman, said yesterday that Lloyd's was
examining the possibility of providing retrospective help by means of a levy
on all Lloyd's Names. But he said today's discussions by the 28 members of
the council would be exploratory.
'I don't expect a ready-made decision,' he said. 'There is nothing cast in
concrete but I do hope to have a view as to whether anything should happen.'
This would be the first time the issue of whether members should help Names
'stranded along the way' has been discussed in the market. Mr Coleridge
stressed: 'You can't change the idea of how Lloyd's works in one meeting.'
It was likely that any proposal would be widely discussed among agencies,
brokers and underwriters on the market and would be submitted to a
referendum of Names.
A prime purpose of any plan would be the end of litigation affecting
Lloyd's. More than 2,000 Names are party to legal actions against their
agents or Lloyd's itself.
A group representing a number of Names associations  - the Lloyd's Names
Associations Working Party  - chaired by Mr Peter Nutting, a member of the
Lloyd's Council, says the insurance market must take action to avert 'a
major solvency and liquidity crisis'.
The group, set up earlier this month, suggests that Lloyd's should obtain
more information on the circumstances of those Names who have suffered most.
It is putting forward proposals to reduce litigation, rescue Names suffering
from catastrophe-reinsurance losses and enable as many Names as possible to
continue underwriting. It advocates:
A cap on losses retrospective to 1987 or 1988. The cap could be about 30 per
cent to 40 per cent of a Name's premium income limit (the amount of capital
Names deposit with Lloyd's), according to one leading member of the group.
The setting up of a fund to compensate and cap the losses of Names involved
in litigation. Payments from the fund would be allocated by mediation.
Errors-and-omissions insurers, which cover agencies against the cost of
legal awards for negligence, could be asked to contribute to this fund.
The creation of a central loan facility of at least Pounds 1bn, from which
Names would be allowed to borrow to fund losses. The loans would then be
repaid from future profits.
The council is also expected to approve regulatory changes needed to pave
the way for the introduction of reforms recommended by the Rowland task
force last January.
But implementation of the reforms, which are designed to improve the
efficiency of the market and strengthen the rights of Names, could take
longer than originally envisaged.
Mr Coleridge said Lloyd's would need to consult a number of regulatory
bodies to see how the changes would affect the market's trading position.
'We want to be certain that the whole thing is in order,' he explained. 'We
don't want to introduce the reforms and then find we've brought the whole
temple down.'
The council had been expected to approve a stop-loss scheme which would
introduce a market-wide levy to finance the excessive losses of individual
Names.
It is understood that changes needed for the setting up of members' agents
pooling arrangements  - unit-trust type devices allowing Names to spread
their trading activities more widely  - may not be in place to allow them to
operate next year.

<TEXT>
ONE of the finest fairy paintings by the Victorian artist Richard Dadd,
Contradiction: Oberon and Titania, could fetch Pounds 1.5m when it is sold
at Christie's in London on June 12.
It was painted at the Bethlem Hospital in Southwark, where Dadd was
committed in 1844 after murdering his father in a fit of madness.
The oval picture, based on a scene from A Midsummer Night's Dream, sold at
auction in 1964 for Pounds 7,000. By 1983, with Victorian art in great
demand, it sold to an American collector for Pounds 550,000, a world record
at the time for a Victorian picture.
London is host this week to a series of Islamic sales.
This has been a difficult market in recent years but Christie's was pleased
with its total of Pounds 699,000, with 87 per cent sold, from yesterday
morning's auction. The top price was Pounds 60,500 for sections of a 13th
century North African Qur'an.
A late 15th century manuscript of love lyrics composed by Shah Mohammed
Nishapuri doubled its original estimate at Pounds 55,000.
Christie's in New York at the weekend secured a world auction record for an
illustrated book when it sold a copy of Audubon's The Birds of America for
Dollars 4m (Pounds 2.3m).

FT  29 APR 92 / TGWU is seen as 'personnel-heavy'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The TGWU, Britain's biggest union, is too 'expensive, bureaucratic and
personnel-heavy,' according to a report from Klein &amp; Co, management
consultants. They criticised the the 11 TGWU regions for acting as
'mini-unions'.
Their report said the union should introduce proper budgeting and accounting
systems and use resources more efficiently.
Mr Bill Morris, TGWU general secretary, outlined the main findings of the
report but stressed that no decisions had been taken on it. He indicated
that the three smallest regions  - on the north coast, south coast and east
coast  - were likely to be merged.
He was unclear about how the political and financial autonomy of the
remaining regions would be reduced to create the 'one union' culture
recommended by Klein, but said there were no plans to centralise the
collection of union dues.
The report said the union should merge district offices, introduce proper
budgeting and accounting systems, provide more professional support for
officials and use its assets more efficiently. Its use of property,
including its headquarters in London, should be improved to reduce the
proportion  - 95 per cent  - of income the union derives from membership
subscriptions.
Mr Morris conceded that one reason the TGWU had missed out on mergers with
smaller unions was because it had been too 'fractured'.

FT  29 APR 92 / Judges consider abandoning their wigs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON and ROBERT RICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CEREMONIAL wigs may be going out of fashion after almost 300 years.
As commercial court judges yesterday debated a proposal from the Commercial
Bar Association that barristers and judges should no longer have to wear
wigs, the new speaker of the Commons, Miss Betty Boothroyd, took her seat
without wearing the traditional wig.
Barristers have complained that wigs are uncomfortable and old-fashioned,
and say they intimidate the public. The commercial judges reached no
conclusions yesterday, but recommended widening the debate to all judges of
the Queen's Bench Division.
Lord Taylor, the new lord chief justice, said yesterday the question of
abandoning wigs was a matter for the Judges' Council, and no decision could
be taken without extensive consultation. He has previously expressed the
opinion that wigs are unnecessary.
Wigs became fashionable in the 17th century under King Charles II and were
adopted by lawyers among others.
Wigs then were made of human hair  - the horsehair wig worn by most
barristers today was invented by Humphrey Ravenscroft in 1822. His company,
Ede and Ravenscroft, the ceremonial outfitters, is still the main supplier
of legal wigs in the UK, and exports to countries with British-inspired
legal systems.
Even if barristers do cast aside their wigs, Ede and Ravenscroft's main
business  - robes for academics, lawyers and the royal family  - shows no
signs of disappearing.
Abandonment of wigs has been proposed before without result, but this time a
relaxation of the rules in some courts seems likely.
LORD MACKAY, the lord chancellor, denied yesterday that he intends to step
down in the autumn after five years in the job, Robert Rice writes.
His department said Lord Mackay was disturbed by continuing press
speculation that he no longer wished to continue in office.
Rumours began circulating in Whitehall shortly before the election that the
lord chancellor would not continue in office for more than six months.
His department said he had been unable to deny the rumours at the time
because the election campaign was under way and parliamentary convention
prevented him from making any statement.
The lord chancellor recently proposed to reduce the normal retirement age
for judges from 75 to 70.  At 65, he could thus remain in office until 1997.
Lord Mackay succeeded the late Lord Havers as lord chancellor in 1987.

AN ATTEMPT to force the governing body of the Royal College of Nursing to
declare its support for the aims of the government's National Health Service
reforms was rejected yesterday by its annual congress, Lisa Wood writes.
The college has opposed the speed of reforms, although it has not spoken out
against the reforms themselves.
Several speakers voiced their concerns over the future of the NHS. Professor
June Clark, president of the council, said she was worried about the
government's hidden agenda.
Mr David Nunn said the written aims of the government's reforms were to
improve patient care, quality and choice. The unwritten aims were to
commercialise the NHS, dismantle it and divide the workforce.

FT  29 APR 92 / Mujahideen government takes power in Kabul
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   KABUL, PESHAWAR
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A NEW Afghan government drawn from the leading Islamic guerrilla groups
yesterday took power in Kabul as heavy fighting continued in parts of the
city.
Professor Sibghatullah Mojaddedi, president of the 51-man interim council
representing the main guerrilla groups, arrived in Kabul by road in the
morning after a 27-hour journey from Peshawar in Pakistan. Accompanying him
was a convoy of vehicles carrying heavily armed mujahideen.
One of his first acts was to declare a general amnesty and to call on
Gulbuddinn Hekmatyar, leader of the Hezb-i-Islam, and his followers to lay
down their arms. But Mr Mojaddedi, who had earlier condemned Mr Hekmatyar as
an 'aggressor,' also warned that they would be punished if they continue to
ferment war.
'If they continue with their activities then this government will punish
them according to the Sharia and Islamic law,' he said.
Excluded from the amnesty was former president Najibullah who is still in
the UN headquarters here. Mr Mojaddedi declined to be specific about his
future but said, 'It is up to the people to decide.'
Mr Mojaddedi formally took over power at a ceremony attended by what remains
of the diplomatic corps here in the Foreign Ministry. He was flanked or
faced by many senior members of the former regime including the prime
minister, the chief justice, and the speakers of the two legislative
assemblies who pledged him their co-operation and support. Mujahideen
guerrillas standing behind interrupted their speeches with cries of Allah-u
Akbar (God is Great).
Immediately after the ceremony intensive fighting broke out in the centre of
the city as Hezbe guerrillas demonstrated their opposition to a new
administration.
Mr Mojaddedi in a brief emotional speech appealed for national unity after
13 years of civil war. 'Now is the time to join hands and to work for the
reconstruction of the country.' In a reference to the fighting that has
accompanied the mujahideen victory he said that Afghans should not be
divided on ethnic lines.
Earlier, jubilant mujahideen fired automatic weapons into the air as the new
president and his convoy arrived in Kabul. But the Hezbe forces gave warning
that they would be resisted by firing 20 shells on to the airport.
Hezbe forces remained entrenched to the south of the city and still held
parts of the ridges overlooking Kabul.
Gen Nabi Azibi, the former head of the Kabul garrison, who greeted the new
president, admitted that there was 'still fighting in some parts of the
city'. But he claimed that forces loyal to Mr Ahmed Shah Masood, the new
minister of defence and head of the Jamiat-i-Islami, were now in control of
Kabul.
Farhan Bokhari adds from Peshawar: In Peshawar's Chowk Yadgar market,
foreign exchange trading undertaken by some 250 dealers is fast gaining
business from events in Afghanistan.
Local dealers say the afghani, the country's currency, has been trading at
around 7.25 Pakistani rupees for 100 afghanis, more than four times the rate
of PRs1.75 per 100 afghanis during the week before the fall of Mr
Najibullah. Intra-mujahideen fighting in Kabul had at one stage pulled it
down to PRs5.50 per 100, however. 'With peace in Afghanistan, we are getting
more customers,' says Mr Haji Sherzadeh Khan, one of the traders.

THE EC said yesterday it could not accept the legal reasoning behind the
condemnation by a Gatt disputes panel in January of exchange rate guarantees
to the German arm of Airbus Industrie.
However, EC officials told Gatt's subsidies committee, which was discussing
the panel's report for the first time yesterday, that the exchange rates
scheme was suspended at the beginning of this year.
The US brought a complaint to Gatt last year as part of its wrangle with the
EC over state support for the four-nation Airbus project. It claims the
German scheme led to Dollars 2.5m (Pounds 1.4m) export subsidy for each of
95 aircraft delivered in 1990.
Bonn suspended the scheme for claims after January 15 1992, but it will stay
in place until the contract with Deutsche Airbus, now owned by Daimler Benz,
is renegotiated.
The mechanism, designed to compensate losses incurred by Deutsche Airbus for
a drop in the dollar's value against the D-Mark, was introduced in 1989 to
sweeten the privatisation deal involving the merger of Daimler Benz with
Messerschmidt-Bolkau-Blohm (MBB).
The US, backed by Japan and Canada, called yesterday for immediate adoption
of the panel's report. However, the EC said the panel's argument was partial
because it ignored provisions governing support for the industry in Gatt's
civil aircraft code.
It denied the exchange rate scheme was an export subsidy, saying it affected
only Deutsche Airbus' financial position, not the competitive position of
Airbus aircraft in the world market.
The panel ruled the scheme constituted an export subsidy on deliveries of
fuselages from Germany to France, but the EC said trade between EC member
states did not constitute an export. The subsidies committee will consider
the panel report at its next meeting.

NEC, the Japanese electronics company and AT&amp;T Microelectronics, the
semiconductor subsidiary of the US telecommunications group, plan a joint
venture to sell AT&amp;T chip products in Japan.
NEC announced the venture in Tokyo yesterday and stressed its value in
reducing US-Japanese trade tensions. But in the US, AT&amp;T Microelectronics
said it had only 'initialled a memorandum of understanding' with NEC and 'a
lot of work remains to be done' on details.
AT&amp;T said the joint sales venture plan had arisen from talks aimed at
enhancing an established strategic partnership between the two companies,
begun two years ago with a technology exchange accord. AT&amp;T has annual sales
of about Dollars 200m (Pounds 112.9m) a year in Japan, but declined to say
how far the venture might lead to expanding its sales there.
NEC's announcement shows its determination to help resolve the chip trade
dispute by boosting US sales in Japan. Last year, the US and Japan agreed
the foreign share of the Japanese chip market should reach 20 per cent by
the end of this year.
But latest data shows the foreign share at only 14.4 per cent in the fourth
quarter of 1991 and flat for the past year. Mrs Carla Hills, US trade
representative, has expressed concern at the lack of progress, and US chip
makers may seek economic sanctions unless sales grow soon.

<TEXT>
STATE FARM, the largest car insurance company in the US, has agreed to pay
Dollars 157m (Pounds 88.7m) to settle sex discrimination charges.
The settlement relates to legal action brought against the Illinois-based
company's Californian operation, and centres on hiring policies for
independent sales agents which existed in the 1970s. The State Farm
settlement will be shared by 814 women.
There have been larger individual awards in sex discrimination cases  - a
Californian court awarded Dollars 20.7m in damages to a Texaco employee  -
but yesterday's agreement is thought to be one of the largest totals paid to
settle such charges.
The original lawsuit was brought against State Farm in 1979, alleging the
insurer had discriminated against women applicants seeking sales agent
positions in California. In 1985 a judge found the company liable, and the
question of damages was addressed.
At first an attempt was made to assess these on an individual basis, via a
trial process. However, according to State Farm, after two years only 150
cases had been considered, prompting a new effort to reach an overall
settlement. This resulted in the current agreement.

FT  29 APR 92 / Ministers call for swift deal on trade
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FINANCE ministers from industrial and developing countries yesterday issued
an urgent call for a swift agreement to liberalise world trade.
Meeting in the interim committee of the International Monetary Fund  - the
Washington-based organisation's principal policy-making body  - the finance
ministers said a rapid conclusion of the Uruguay Round of the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt) was essential to restore dynamism to
world trade and would contribute to economic recovery.
'All countries stand to benefit from the round, and would suffer from a
failure,' the committee said in a communique.
'The success of the negotiations is a must.'
Mr Carlos Solchaga, Spain's finance minister and the chairman of the
committee, said it was not easy to negotiate in an election year, but
expressed disappointment over the Gatt deadlock. 'It must be said that
responsibility is not shared equally among the different members of Gatt. It
lies mainly on the US and the European Community,' he said.
Mr Solchaga said the failure to reach a new agreement put the IMF in the
difficult position of asking developing countries to adopt 'perfectionist'
economic policies and open up their own markets, while the industrial
countries kept protectionist barriers.
In other comments the interim committee communique called for appropriate
monetary and fiscal policies to assure recovery and sustainable growth;
welcomed signs of a stronger economic performance by developing countries;
praised the efforts of the countries of eastern Europe and the former Soviet
Union to reform their economies; and expressed its concern that the IMF's
quota increase had not yet come into effect.

FT  29 APR 92 / Bush, Clinton score easy wins in Pennsylvania
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT George Bush and Governor Bill Clinton last night claimed easy
victories in the presidential primary election in Pennsylvania, the fifth
largest state in the union.
Early results had Mr Bush beating Mr Patrick Buchanan, who had not
campaigned in the state, by a three-to-one margin. No estimates of the size
of Mr Clinton's victory were immediately available.
In two Senate primaries, watched more closely than the presidential contest,
Ms Lynn Yeakel, in her first-ever political race, held an early lead on the
Democratic side. If she wins she will face the incumbent Republican, Mr
Arlen Specter, who comfortably beat an arch-conservative opponent.
Even before the polls had closed the White House was saying that the 91
Republican delegates won by Mr Bush yesterday gave him more than the 1,105
he needs to wrap up the nomination.
But a spokesman was later obliged to admit that a few assumptions had been
made in the calculation.
The president himself, in an appearance before campaign workers in
Washington, was conspicuously upbeat, saying that he was ready to rebut all
the outrageous accusations he claimed were being made against him by the
opposition. The Bush campaign's theme of this week, following last week's
concentration on international trade, has been to portray the president as a
sure winner on both the economic and political front.
Mr Clinton's victory probably mattered more, given the doubts raised about
his candidacy and the surge in support for Mr Ross Perot, the prospective
independent candidate. It was not immediately clear how many of the state's
169 delegates he would win. Before the primary he had about 1,350 of the
2,145 delegates needed for the nomination.
Of particular encouragement, according to the exit polls, was the fact that
Pennsylvanian Democrats, who tend towards the conservative, had fewer
reservations about his character and integrity than had been evident in
earlier primaries.
However, Pennsylvania was always likely to be more hospitable ground to the
governor of Arkansas than New York. His only active opponent, Mr Jerry
Brown, the former governor of California, had a lacklustre performance in
the state.
Last night Mr Bush was due to attend what was being described as the biggest
political fund-raising dinner in US political history, with contributors
paying Dollars 92,000 (Pounds 52,000) to enjoy the privilege of being
photographed with him and the vice-president.

BRITAIN proposed yesterday that the IMF and World Bank be prepared to
support South Africa once a planned interim government was in place.
Mr Norman Lamont, UK chancellor, told the development committee of the IMF
and World Bank that he hoped the groups would consider positively future
requests for help from South Africa in view of the pace of reform there.
South Africa will not need IMF assistance as it has a balance of payments
surplus. However, the UK wants the World Bank to react swiftly to any
request for loans.
Mr Lamont also made several proposals to help the poorest nations. He urged
the IMF to adopt a flexible approach when providing aid on concessional
terms to developing countries in southern Africa, which are suffering a
prolonged drought.

FT  29 APR 92 / Perot challenge focuses minds: Jurek Martin looks at the
electoral battles to come
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   THE latest popularity poll from the west
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
showing that Mr Ross Perot is virtually level with President George Bush in
California, with Mr Bill Clinton a close third  - is beginning to focus the
minds of Republican and Democratic strategists on the impact of a strong
independent candidacy in the presidential election.
Vice-President Dan Quayle, for example, noted with some glee this week that
it was quite possible Mr Perot would pass Mr Clinton in the national polls
in the weeks ahead and even emerge as Mr Bush's main challenger in November.
But his satisfaction at this prospect is tempered by growing evidence that
Mr Perot is most popular at this early stage in the south-west and west,
regions which have voted solidly Republican.
The Los Angeles Times survey of Californian voters gave Mr Bush 33 per cent,
Mr Perot 32 per cent and Mr Clinton 26 per cent. Other local polls have put
the Texas businessman ahead in his home state and in New Mexico and coming
on strongly in Arizona.
Even if Mr Perot's support fades as the electoral year progresses, as most
third-party candidacies have, the threat he poses to the two main party
candidates may yet determine the outcome in critical states.
The most immediate concern is for Mr Clinton, assuming he is the Democratic
nominee. To be relegated to third place would undermine his credibility
further, which explains why he has taken to attacking Mr Perot.
On the other hand, the historical record, demonstrated in 1892, 1912, 1968
and 1980, is that measurable independent candidacies tend to hurt the
incumbent president most. Exceptions to this, however, were registered in
1924 and 1948.
Much would depend on how Mr Perot's support holds up. Probably the best rule
of thumb is that the more votes he gets the more he hurts the Democratic
candidate, whereas if his support drops his natural market is more in the
Republican ranks, concentrated in regions where he appeals most.
Mr Perot encourages this prospect by attacking Mr Bush more consistently
than he does Mr Clinton. He said this week that if his friend, Senator Lloyd
Bentsen from Texas, were the Democratic candidate he would not be running.
A strong Perot performance in November also raises the prospect of no
candidate securing a majority in the electoral college, which in turn would
throw the choice of the next president into the new House of
Representatives.
But Mr Perot would have to do very well for this to happen. George Wallace
got 13 per cent of the national vote in 1968 and carried five southern
states, but this was not enough to deny Richard Nixon a comfortable victory
in the electoral college (though not in the national vote) over Hubert
Humphrey.
Conventional wisdom, supported by history, still has it that in the US, as
in Britain, independent, or third-party, candidacies get squeezed in the
autumn as the two main parties become energised. Certainly Mr Perot is now
the subject of the sort of media scrutiny, not all of it favourable, which
can take the bloom off his political rose.
Additionally, he has no formal political organisation in the country at
large, beyond the small army of volunteers now trying to get his name on the
ballot in every state.
Working for Mr Perot are his vast private financial resources, equivalent to
what the two main parties are likely to spend, and the pervasive sense of
dissatisfaction with politics-as-usual and the likely two major candidates.

FT  29 APR 92 / Mexico's current account deficit rises to dollars 13.3bn
</HEADLINE>

   MEXICO CITY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MEXICO'S current account deficit rose to Dollars 13.3bn (Pounds 7.5bn) last
year, Dollars 2.2bn more than the government's forecast last November and
almost double 1990's deficit of Dollars 7.1bn, writes Damian Fraser in
Mexico City.
However, in its annual report the Bank of Mexico claimed the deficit
attracted its own financing and, because public finances were healthy, was
of no cause for concern. Mexico ran a record surplus of Dollars 20.2bn in
the capital account last year, helping push up reserves to Dollars 17.55bn
at the end of 1991 which, in turn, was Dollars 7.39bn more than at the end
of 1990.
The deficit was fuelled by a rapid increase of imports to Dollars 38.2bn,
22.9 per cent more than in 1990, against stagnant exports. The bank drew
comfort from the performance of non-oil exports, up 15.9 per cent, and
slower growth of consumer imports.
Critics charge that the roughly 9 per cent real appreciation of the peso
against the dollar last year helped trigger the deterioration in the trade
position.
The bank said that foreign investment amounted to an impressive Dollars
12.3bn last year, of which Dollars 7.5bn was portfolio investment and
Dollars 4.8bn direct physical investment. The portfolio investment was
fuelled by successful share offerings in Telmex, the privatised telephone
company, and huge foreign appetite for other blue-chip Mexican equity and
peso denominated debt.

FT  29 APR 92 / Pemex shake-up may follow gas blast: A strengthened case for
restructuring at Mexico's state oil company
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAMIAN FRASER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE explosion that killed at least 191 people in Guadalajara, Mexico last
week may have strengthened the hand of those wishing to restructure
Petroleos Mexicanos (Pemex), the once-proud state oil concern.
On Monday, Mexico's attorney-general, Mr Ignacio Morales Lechuga, ordered
the jailing of seven government officials, including four from Pemex, for
charges including negligent homicide. The blast was caused, said the
attorney-general, by a leak of large quantities of petrol, combined with
other combustibles, into the city's sewer system, as a result of a corroded
water pipe. The Pemex officials had called off an emergency check of gas
leaks in the early morning of the explosion.
Pemex, along with local government officials who failed to evacuate the
endangered area after receiving complaints about gas leaks, has come under
fierce criticism. The outrage has been fuelled by Pemex's original denial of
all responsibility, coming just a couple of hours after the explosion, and
the public accusation it made against a small cooking-oil company (which is
still being investigated).
Rescue workers showed their disgust by interrupting a press conference given
by the governor responsible for Guadalajara, and demanding that Pemex be
held accountable for the deaths. Newspapers have run critical accounts of
Pemex's safety and environmental record, suggesting many more cities are at
risk from similar explosions. Proceso, Mexico's weekly news magazine, claims
the company had known about the gas leak for eight days without doing
anything about it.
The tarnishing of Pemex's image may, in the long run, make it easier for the
technocrats in charge of the government to push ahead with sweeping reforms
of the company, some of which are being demanded by the US in negotiations
over the North American free trade agreement.
Mr Rogelio Ramirez, an economic consultant, said: 'I would be very surprised
if the government did not take this opportunity to shake up Pemex.'
The government may for example loosen restrictions on allowing private
capital into energy, break Pemex up into holding companies, and force a much
more vigorous and public audit of its operations and finances.
Until now the president has shied away from a radical restructuring of
Pemex, probably for fear of creating a backlash in the company that would
damage productivity. Pemex's exports of Dollars 8.3bn a year account for
about 26 per cent of the country's total.
Pemex thus still remains a law unto itself, whose operations are a guarded
secret. The lack of accountability appears to have created a culture of
negligence, in which accidents are not uncommon. Last year a refinery blew
up killing at least six and injuring 329. In 1984 tanks of liquid gas
exploded killing 400.
Pemex shoulders the blame with local government officials, whose actions
before and after the explosion underline the huge gap between the apparently
articulate, clean-cut ministers in charge of Mexico's federal government,
and politics at a local level. It appears officials, apart from failing to
enforce environmental regulations, repeatedly ignored warnings that gas was
leaking from the sewerage, and failed to evacuate residents when there was
still time.
Despite the evidence, the governor, Mr Guillermo Cosio, who has long been
tainted by charges in the press over corruption and nepotism, said at first
that no government official was at fault. Then he claimed that residents had
been warned, but behaved like little children in doing exactly the opposite
to what they were told. Critics claim that, in ordering bulldozers to clear
up the rubble before all bodies were found, local authorities may have
caused more deaths.
Mexicans are concerned that similar accidents could occur elsewhere, and are
demanding even more forcefully that the government enforce and business obey
Mexico's environmental and safety laws.
An editorial in Epoca, a weekly magazine, captured some of the public mood
when it said: 'All of us in the cities live in constant risk. We live
without fire escapes; meeting halls do not have emergency exits, and when
there are, they are closed; gases, liquids, and other dangerous substances
are released as if they were nothing . . . It is not possible to manage the
lives of millions of Mexicans under a dictatorship of casualness. And that
is what we have been doing so disgracefully for a long time.'

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Boris Yeltsin said yesterday Russia did not share all the views of
the International Monetary Fund and would not allow it to dictate conditions
to Moscow, the Interfax news agency reported, Reuter reports from Moscow.
On Monday the IMF and World Bank approved membership for Russia and other
former Soviet republics, opening the way to a Dollars 24bn (Pounds 13.5bn)
western aid package.
'We do not intend to work to the direct dictation of the IMF,' Mr Yeltsin
said before leaving on a three-day tour of northern Russia and Siberia. 'We
do not share the views of this organisation on everything and we will stick
to our point of view.'
Mr Yeltsin's conservative critics say the aid package will tie the
government's hands and put the country under the west's effective control.
'We do not want to throw ourselves head first into the abyss and grab all
Dollars 24bn at once,' the president said.
Russia intended to work out carefully what to do with the money and in this
way should avoid the 'social cataclysm' which had enveloped some third world
countries after receiving IMF aid, he added.
Peter Norman adds from Washington: Mr Yeltsin's remarks caused no visible
concern at the IMF's Washington headquarters.
'It means that President Yeltsin has perfectly understood the methods of the
IMF,' said Mr Michel Camdessus, the organisation's managing director. That
is 'never to dictate but to agree with the country on a programme which is
basically the programme of that country'.
While some diplomats attending the spring meetings of the IMF and World Bank
dismissed Mr Yeltsin's remarks as political posturing, others looked ahead
to a difficult learning process after the initial euphoria associated with
IMF and World Bank membership for Russia and the other former Soviet
republics had died down.
The US Treasury has put forward a compromise proposal to permit Russia and
other former Soviet republics to join the International Finance Corporation,
the World Bank affiliate which promotes private-sector investment, as soon
as possible.
Membership has been snagged by an insufficient supply of IFC shares
available for Russia and the other republics to take up their full
entitlements in the corporation.
According to a senior US Treasury official, the US has proposed that the
states join the IFC by taking up shares available and be given access to the
IFC's resources. The shareholdings would then be topped up as and when new
shares became available.

A US judge has jailed Mr Christopher Drogoul, the man at the centre of the
scandal over more than Dollars 4bn (Pounds 2.2bn) of improper Iraqi loans
extended by the Atlanta, Georgia branch of Italy's Banca Nazionale del
Lavoro (BNL), writes Alan Friedman in New York.
Mr Drogoul, the former manager of the BNL Atlanta branch, is due to stand
trial on June 2 over the affair.
Documents obtained by the Financial Times show that more than half of the
BNL loans to Baghdad helped to finance Mr Saddam Hussein's development of
nuclear, chemical and ballistic missile projects.
According to Ms Gerrilyn Brill, the first assistant US attorney in Atlanta,
Mr Drogoul was jailed because of fears that he might flee the country. Ms
Brill could not, however, explain why such fears had arisen some 14 months
after Mr Drogoul was originally indicted; he has been at liberty ever since.
It is understood that US prosecutors were infuriated four weeks ago when Mr
Drogoul broke his long silence and told an Italian newspaper that US
government officials had secret knowledge of the BNL Atlanta loans to Iraq's
military procurement network.

FT  29 APR 92 / Walesa hankers after stronger role: Anthony Robinson asks
whether a powerful presidency would benefit Poland
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Lech Walesa, the Solidarity hero who led Poland from communism to
freedom, is engaged in a power struggle with the product of his efforts  -
the government of Mr Jan Olszewski.
The prime minister heads a coalition cobbled together from seven of 10
political parties which gained more than a dozen seats in inconclusive
elections last October.
The fact that no single party gained more than 12 per cent of the vote and
that 58 per cent of the electorate did not vote in the first free elections
since the Second World War has reinforced Mr Walesa's ability to claim that
he is more representative of Poles than the parliament and the government
sustained by it.
He after all was elected president with a 75 per cent majority in 1990,
although only after he failed to win an overall majority in the first round.
This failure and the indifference of the electorate in the October elections
indicate that few Poles believe either in charismatic leaders or mediocre
politicians.
But this is not the conclusion reached by Mr Walesa. With increasing
persistence he is insisting that Poland needs the dynamic leadership that
can only come from an executive-style president enjoying wide political
powers.
A man with acute political antennae and considerable political intuition, he
knows many Poles are frustrated and angry that democracy has not brought
greater prosperity. Speaking to thousands of Solidarity supporters from the
nearly bankrupt state enterprises outside the presidential palace last week,
Mr Walesa hinted that he might try to re-create a mass movement to give him
the support needed to push ahead faster with the reforms he knows Poland
needs.
But Mr Walesa has little understanding of economics and many question
whether he has the knowledge or the patience to be an effective executive
president. The message from a recent World Bank report is that for Poland,
as elsewhere in the region, there are no short cuts, just the need for years
of hard slogging to build up the institutions and skills of a market economy
and the self-confident middle class needed to sustain a democracy.
The irony is that Mr Walesa knows that Poland has no real alternative but to
swallow the IMF and World bank medicine. If he gained greater powers he
would have to use them to demand the sacrifices required. This is precisely
what happened to Mr Olszewski, who became prime minister by criticising the
economic policies of the first two post-communist governments but now runs a
government whose key member, Mr Andrjez Olechowski, is the finance minister
dedicated to keeping the budget deficit within IMF limits.
If Mr Walesa did succeed in bringing down the government the most that he
would probably achieve would be the promotion of Mr Olechowski from the
finance ministry to the premiership. But this would leave the constitutional
issue of the relationship between the president, the government and
parliament unresolved. The essential stand-off in Polish politics would
remain.

FT  29 APR 92 / Germans cools to Maastricht pact
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MARSH

<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GERMAN companies are the least enthusiastic in the larger European Community
countries about the Maastricht treaty for European union, according to an
international business opinion survey published yesterday.
The survey also indicates that a surprisingly large proportion  - 18 per
cent  - of German business leaders believe their country will fail to meet
the economic conditions for monetary union.
The report, based on 1,483 interviews with company directors in seven EC
countries, was carried out by Harris Research for the United Parcel Service
distribution company.
The findings back up the impression that German public opinion has cooled
markedly on the aim of European union as a result of the country's
post-unification difficulties.
Widespread support has also been revealed for setting up a European central
bank to run monetary union. More than half of respondents in Belgium, the
Netherlands, Italy, France, Britain and Spain said they supported this, but
only 35 per cent of German companies thought monetary union a good idea.
French, Italian and Belgian business leaders were the most enthusiastic
about the treaty. In Britain, 43 per cent were in favour. In Germany,
however, 19 per cent thought it 'poor' or 'very poor'.
The survey provides reassuring confirmation of widely perceived national
characteristics. The British and Germans are most in favour of free
competition, with the French the least supportive. German companies are most
pessimistic about future business prospects, with the French the most
optimistic.
The survey reveals widespread self-doubt in individual countries about their
chances of fulfilling the Maastricht criteria set for monetary union.
A total of 77 per cent of Italians think their country will not fulfil the
eligibility test, as do 56 per cent of Belgians and 29 per cent of British.
The most confident country appears to be France, where only 2 per cent think
their own nation will fail to mount the monetary union hurdle.
The Maastricht treaty sets conditions covering eligibility for monetary
union, laying down that countries have to keep their budget deficits to 3
per cent of gross domestic product, and restrain national debt to 60 per
cent of GDP.

THE GERMAN public sector strike spread yesterday, halting public transport
throughout the Ruhr industrial region and causing huge traffic jams on the
motorways, as both sides dug in for an extended battle.
The oTV public service union promised to call out refuse disposal workers
across the country today in a deliberate escalation of the wage conflict
with both central and local government employers. Up to 4m metal and
engineering workers have threatened large-scale warning stoppages, also
beginning today.
More rail and post workers came out, causing further train delays and a
mounting mail backlog. Most people got to work, however.
There was no sign of any softening in the employers' position, although all
three chief negotiators appealed for a return to the negotiating table.
The employers refuse to improve on the volume of their pay offer above 4.8
per cent, although they are talking of more money for the low paid, and
possible improvements in fringe benefits.
The worst chaos yesterday was around the city of Dusseldorf, the capital of
North Rhine-Westphalia, where traffic jams of up to 60km were reported from
the surrounding motorways. Commuters had to walk, cycle or drive to work in
private cars or taxis, causing a boom in both cycle-hire and taxi fares in
the Ruhr region.
The deliberate escalation of the conflict was announced in Stuttgart by Mr
Wolfgang Warburg, deputy leader of the oTV. Some 170,000 workers were
reported on strike yesterday, compared with 75,000 on Monday. He said that
refuse workers would come out across the country today, as well as hospital
administration workers in six cities  - Heidelberg, Ludwigsburg, Ulm,
Duisburg, Cologne and Munich.
'We must step up the pressure,' Mr Warburg told an open-air press conference
outside the union headquarters, after the building was evacuated for a bomb
threat.
Rubbish strikes began yesterday in three states, but the main focus was on
disruption of public transport. Mrs Monika Wulf-Mathies, the militant oTV
leader, told a Duisburg strike meeting: 'We will strike until the employers
make a new and better offer.'
Chancellor Helmut Kohl, although officially aloof from the conflict, is
insisting that the pay deal must remain below 5 per cent, against a union
pay claim of 9.5 per cent, and an arbitration tribunal award (rejected by
the employers) of 5.4 per cent.
Mrs Wulf-Mathies says the union would have accepted 5.4 per cent, but now
wants more. Mr Bjorn Engholm, leader of the opposition Social Democrats, is
urging the employers to pay the 5.4 per cent.
The strike takes place against a background of confused economic signals.
Latest figures for industrial production in eastern Germany  - where workers
are not on strike  - showed a new slump of 4.5 per cent in January, with a
fall of 8.5 per cent in manufacturing industry. On the other hand, the
engineering industry reported a real increase in orders of 7 per cent in
March.

FT  29 APR 92 / Kravchuk wants western surety on missiles disposal

UKRAINIAN President Leonid Kravchuk, facing what he sees as an increasingly
hostile Russia, said yesterday he was seeking security guarantees from the
west in exchange for dismantling Ukraine's strategic missiles. The
republican leader, who visits the US next week, said he would link
guarantees to 46 inter-continental ballistic missiles in Ukraine not covered
by last summer's Start treaty between the US and the former Soviet Union.
'This question has become particularly acute because some of our neighbours
are making territorial claims on us, especially our big neighbour, Russia,'
he said.
Meanwhile, Kazakhkstan's president, Mr Nursultan Nazarbayev, said his
country must be regarded as a nuclear state, if only 'temporarily.' His
statement advances the much-feared possibility that all four nuclear
republics  - Belarus, Russia, Ukraine and Kazakhstan  - would continue to
hold them indefinitely.
Mr Nazarbayev said he wanted a 'strategic alliance' with guarantees from the
US against nuclear attack from Russia, China or the US itself. In return,
Kazakhstan would show 'flexibility' on signing the non-proliferation treaty.
Both men's remarks drew a response last night from Mr James Baker, US
secretary of state, who said that the US had already offered a limited,
standard security guarantee.
Mr Kravchuk said Ukraine's pledge last autumn to become nuclear-free 'set a
good example for the world' but 'we are also weakening ourselves'.  Ukraine
would also require compensation to defray the cost of dismantling warheads.
Since Mr Kravchuk's announcement last month of a temporary freeze on the
shipment of Ukraine's 1,000 tactical weapons to Russia, their fate has been
clouded by contradictory statements.
Mr Kravchuk yesterday held out the hope that the troubled Start treaty,
which covers 130 intercontinental missiles in Ukraine, would soon be
ratified. He said the four nuclear republics would soon sign a protocol with
the US clearing the way for ratification by all four. Mr Nazarbayev said he
wanted his republic to sign the Start treaty as a separate state. Russia has
insisted that it alone should ratify it, as successor to the Soviet Union.
In a bitter comment on relations between the republics, Mr Kravchuk said the
US had adopted a more favourable attitude to Ukraine, and that it was easier
for him to reach an agreement with Mr Baker than with republican leaders.
The tension between Ukraine and the Commonwealth of Independent States
dominated by Russia, was emphasised yesterday when the CIS navy commander
dismissed officers who had sworn allegiance to Ukraine. His action followed
a telegram from Colonel General Konstantin Morozov, Ukrainian defence
minister, to Marshal Yevgeni Shaposhnikov, CIS commander in chief,
requesting that all CIS officers serving on Ukrainian territory who had not
taken an oath of allegiance to Ukraine be suspended and transferred. Gen
Morozov also asked that Ukrainian officers serving outside the republic be
sent home.

FT  29 APR 92 / Kinkel: tailor-made for foreign ministry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR KLAUS KINKEL, German Justice Minister and now nominated in a Bonn palace
coup as foreign minister, has had a technocratic career in government almost
tailor-made for the job. What he lacks is political experience.
If he orchestrated the coup last night against Mrs Irmgard Schwaetzer, the
first choice for foreign minister not only of their own Free Democratic
Party (FDP) leadership, but also of Chancellor Helmut Kohl and Mr
Hans-Dietrich Genscher, the present incumbent, then he is learning fast.
He was selected last night by the parliamentary group of the FDP by 63 votes
to 25, instead of Mrs Schwaetzer, thanks to a back-bench revolt against the
leadership.
The irony is that Mr Kinkel has been if anything more of a protege of Mr
Genscher for more than 20 years than Mrs Schwaetzer. A soft-spoken Swabian
from Metzingen in the south-west state of Baden-Wurttemberg, he was first
spotted by the former FDP leader as a young lawyer in the Interior Ministry
in 1970.
He was rapidly promoted by Mr Genscher, then interior minister, to be his
personal assistant, and then the head of his personal office. When Mr
Genscher transferred to the Foreign Office in 1974, he took Mr Kinkel with
him to continue running his office. Then he promoted him to run the
ministry's prestigious planning staff.
In 1979 he became head of the BND, the troubled German intelligence service,
again with the recommendation and blessing of Mr Genscher. There he is
credited with quietly and competently restoring the morale in a service
undermined by spy scandals.
In 1982 he came back into mainstream government as state secretary in the
Justice Ministry, and only became a fully-fledged politician after the last
election in 1990, when he was immediately promoted justice minister.
Yet he had already made his name not merely as a cool crisis manager in the
ministry. He also defused the hunger strike by Red Army Faction terrorists
in 1989, negotiating a deal with them in prison.
It is only in the past year that he has emerged as a potential leader in the
FDP, a party desperately casting round to find a successor to the old
generation of Mr Genscher and his long-time colleague, Mr Otto Lambsdorff.
In contrast to his colleague Mr Jurgen Mollemann, the outspoken and
publicity-conscious economics minister, Mr Kinkel is cool and pragmatic. It
could be just what the party, and the Foreign Office, needs.

THE United Nations yesterday cautiously agreed to extend its involvement in
the Balkans to Bosnia-Herzegovina, reflecting the growing threat to local
and European security posed by the former Yugoslav republic.
'The United Nations is ready to play a role in Bosnia on condition that it
has the resources,' said Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali after talks
in Paris with President Francois Mitterrand.
Bosnia's foreign minister yesterday strongly urged the despatch of
peacekeeping troops to Bosnia as fighting erupted in several towns.
Mr Haris Siladjzic, who is temporarily heading the Moslem delegation to the
EC-sponsored peace talks in Lisbon, said financial considerations should not
be allowed to delay the sending of UN troops.
Qualified support also came from Mr Radovan Karadzic, the leader of Bosnia's
Serb community, and from Mr Mate Boban, deputy leader of the Croat minority.
Bosnian peace talks scheduled to get under way in Lisbon yesterday were
delayed by the late arrival of the republic's president, Mr Alija
Izetbegovic.

FT  29 APR 92 / Lloyds sets out plan to bid Pounds 3.6bn for Midland:
Hongkong Bank says rival offer would reduce UK banking competition
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LLOYDS BANK yesterday said it was planning to make a Pounds 3.6bn offer to
acquire its rival Midland Bank and urged the government to carry out a
thorough review of competition in the UK banking industry.
It said that if it succeeded in buying Midland it would reduce staff numbers
at the combined banks by 20,000 over four years and close 1,000 branches.
Annual overheads of the joined operations would be cut by Pounds 700m.
However, Mr Brian Pitman, Lloyds' chief executive, insisted there would be
no compulsory redundancies and that the axe would fall on Lloyds' operations
as well as on Midland's. He said Lloyds would preserve 'the best of each
bank'.
Sir Jeremy Morse, Lloyds' chairman, insisted that his bank was 'not making a
hostile bid', but bankers said Sir Jeremy was 'playing with words'. They had
no doubt that Lloyds was in effect making the first ever hostile bid attempt
by a UK clearer for a domestic rival.
At 7.30 yesterday morning, after four months of secret preparations, Lloyds
said it would offer one new Lloyds share and 30p in cash to acquire each
Midland share. However, it set an unusual precondition on its bid.
The offer would not be put to Midland shareholders, Lloyds said, if the
takeover proposal was referred for investigation by the Monopolies and
Mergers Commission, the UK competition authority, unless the rival bid for
Midland by Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation was also investigated
by the MMC.
Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, met Department of
Trade and Industry officials immediately after Lloyds' announcement to
discuss the bank's bid plans. Officials at the Office of Fair Trading said
the OFT would probably advise Mr Heseltine to refer the Lloyds bid to the
MMC.
Before Lloyds' intervention, analysts believed he would not refer the
Hongkong Bank bid on the basis of the government's competition policy of the
past decade. However, Mr Pitman said that Midland's customers would benefit
more from a Lloyds takeover than from one by Hongkong Bank so it was in 'the
national interest' that both bids be referred to the MMC.
Mr Heseltine will also have to grapple with the issue of whether the
Hongkong bid falls properly into his jurisdiction or whether it should be
vetted exclusively by the European Community competition authority in
Brussels. DTI officials said they were still at the stage of accumulating
information on this question.
If Lloyds acquires Midland  - and it admitted that it faced a stiff
challenge  - its position as the UK's most profitable bank would be
reinforced. It would also become the UK's biggest bank in terms of branch
numbers, employing 125,500 people. Measured by gross assets it would be the
UK's third biggest and would rank 18th in the world.
Midland, whose directors met for an emergency board meeting between 5.30pm
and 8pm, made no formal response to Lloyds' proposal. However it is expected
to maintain its backing for Hongkong Bank's Pounds 3.3bn offer when it
issues a statement today.
Mr William Purves, chairman of Hongkong Bank, immediately went on to the
offensive, saying a Lloyds takeover would reduce competition in the UK
banking industry and would 'mean the destruction of Midland'.
Mr Pitman said Midland's customers would benefit more from Lloyds' plan than
from Hongkong's. He hopes to offer better products and services if the bid
is successful and will outline these in the next fortnight.
He added that a Lloyds takeover would not have the adverse effect on
competition in the UK banking industry that some analysts have been
predicting.
Small businesses have been particularly concerned that the combination of
Midland and Lloyds would in effect lead to the removal of a vital source of
loans.
However, Mr Pitman insisted that the combination of Lloyds and Midland would
offer a stiffer challenge in the small business market to the leaders,
Barclays and National Westminster, thereby forcing them to provide an
improved service, benefiting all small business customers.
Midland's share price rose from 381p to 394p, which compares with the
447p-a-share value of Lloyds' proposed terms. Lloyds fell from 427p to 417p.

MPs from all parties yesterday called for a Monopolies and Mergers
Commission investigation into the projected Lloyds Bank bid for Midland.
The Labour party urged the commission to consider both the Lloyds bid and
the agreed offer by Hongkong and Shanghai Bank with particular emphasis on
the future of the workforce. Most Tories believe a Lloyds bid should be
referred.
The main banking union, the Banking, Insurance and Finance Union, promised
to fight a Lloyds takeover.
Large companies, however, welcomed the latest planned bid. The chief
executive of a large textile company said: 'This should have happened years
ago. Any reduction in competition will not be damaging.'
Smaller companies were concerned about the reduction of choice if there were
only three big banks instead of four.
Mr Jonathan Fowler, chairman of Chinecrest Archives, a Pounds 1m-turnover
company which stores documents for banks and insurance companies, said: 'The
larger companies have the bargaining power to stand up to the banks but we
have to go along with what they say.'

GERMANY'S ruling coalition was thrown into disarray last night, when the
nomination of Mrs Irmgard Schwaetzer as foreign minister was rejected by her
own party, the minority Free Democrats (FDP).
In a shock vote last night in the party's parliamentary group, Mrs
Schwaetzer was defeated by Mr Klaus Kinkel, the 55-year-old justice
minister, who is now expected to succeed Mr Hans-Dietrich Genscher in the
key government post.
There was no reaction from Chancellor Helmut Kohl and other members of the
coalition, but the confusion seems sure to damage the government's
international standing.
The nomination of Mrs Schwaetzer, currently construction minister and
formerly a deputy foreign minister, was seen as favoured by Mr Kohl.
At the same time there was public disagreement between the chancellor's
Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and its Bavarian sister-party, the
Christian Social Union (CSU), over the appointment of a deputy chancellor to
replace Mr Genscher.
The CSU wants the post for its own leader, Mr Theo Waigel, the finance
minister, but Mr Kohl insists that it belongs to the minority FDP.
The turmoil in the corridors of the coalition coincides with an
intensification of the public- sector strike launched at the weekend in an
increasingly bitter campaign for higher wages. Public transport throughout
the industrial Ruhr region was brought to a standstill, causing motorway
jams, and refuse disposal workers throughout the country will be called out
today.
After a day of confusion in Bonn it seemed virtually certain that FDP
back-benchers would get their way and Mr Kinkel would become foreign
minister to succeed Mr Genscher, his long-time mentor.
An FDP meeting, which argued for five stormy hours before voting for Mr
Kinkel, also decided that Mr Jurgen Mollemann, economics minister, should be
its candidate for deputy chancellor.
The revolt in the FDP was led by parliamentary back-benchers, furious at
their party executive for nominating Mrs Schwaetzer without consultation.
They demanded a meeting with the executive yesterday afternoon, at which Mr
Kinkel said he was willing to serve as foreign minister. The group gave him
63 votes to only 25 for Mrs Schwaetzer.
Mr Kinkel, a lawyer, was head of West Germany's BND intelligence service
from January 1979 until October 1982 when he became a state secretary in the
Ministry of Justice. During his years at the BND, he worked hand-in-hand
with Mr Genscher at the Foreign Ministry.
Married and with three daughters and a son, he studied law at the
universities of Tubingen, Bonn and Cologne.
The political manoeuvring in Bonn last night overshadowed the growing chaos
caused by the strike. Central government and state employers urged the
unions to return to negotiations, but union leaders refused to do so without
an improved offer.
The oTV public sector union, with 900,000 members, is demanding a 9.5 per
cent pay rise. The government has offered 4.8 per cent and rejected an
arbitration award of 5.4 per cent.
The union promised yesterday that refuse disposal workers and hospital
administrators would join the strike today.

FT  29 APR 92 / PM says recovery under way
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL and PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STEADY and stable economic recovery is under way in Britain, which is poised
on the brink of a new era of prosperity, Mr John Major, the prime minister,
claimed yesterday.
In his first keynote speech since the general election, a confident and
optimistic Mr Major told the Institute of Directors that Britain was 'ready
to move forward, just when some of our main rivals are running into
difficulties'.
Speaking to 2,500 company executives at the Royal Albert Hall in London, Mr
Major claimed that Britain had decisively turned its back on high taxes,
high inflation, trade union power and interventionist policies.
People recognised that free enterprise  - not state intervention and
socialism  - was the route to national health and prosperity.
In a passage less strident than Mrs Margaret Thatcher's pledge to destroy
socialism, her successor nevertheless said that the government intended to
secure continuing prosperity by removing the 'pendulum of uncertainty' that
hit business prospects before elections.
The prime minister went out of his way to pay tribute to Mr Norman Lamont,
the chancellor, who he claimed had done 'an outstanding job for Britain'
during a difficult 18 months. The chancel-lor, he said, had never taken the
easy road 'but always the right one' and had rarely won credit for doing so.
Mr Major claimed that, in the light of the election result, he was more
confident than ever that economic recovery, aided by the imminent
introduction of tax cuts announced in the Budget, was under way.
He said the outlook for unemployment was beginning to look more hopeful and
the jobless figures could be expected to steady before falling back. 'As
spring advances, so will confidence,' he added.
Mr Major stressed that Britain needed a recovery that was sustainable, and
the government was determined to pursue policies which minimised the risk of
a recession occurring again. He added: 'As spring advances, so will
confidence.'
Mr Major identified his government's targets for the 1990s as 'stable
prices, sustained industrial peace, free enterprise given the chance to
compete and win, and lasting growth without the scourge of inflation'. The
prime minister was applauded when he pledged early legislation to complete
the government's reform of trade union laws and said he intended to 'hold at
bay' the provisions of the EC social chapter which would add Pounds 5bn to
the costs of British industry.

FT  29 APR 92 / Survey of The Isle of Man (7): A full life if you can adjust
 -Tax exiles must heed the three-year rule
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SUE STUART
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN THE 1960s and early 1970s, it was not unusual to see very elderly people
being wheeled in chairs or on stretchers down the Steam Packet gangway and
on to Manx soil. Their private rooms were already booked in the local
hospital, and they had come to the Isle of Man to die.
But they arrived with just enough breath in them to be rushed around by
teams of lawyers, accountants and undertakers, standing by to settle their
affairs the moment they got ashore.
These were the inheritance-tax exiles, who needed to prove that the Isle of
Man was their domicile of choice before they expired.
Prior to changes in the law in the mid-1970s, this could all be done at the
last moment. But the law changed, and now requires a minimum of three years'
residence prior to death for the revenue to allow a place to become a
person's domicile of choice. So moving to the Isle of Man to die has become
a far more civilised affair.
Since the Isle of Man has no capital gains tax or inheritance tax, people
move there to avoid these liabilities in the UK.
Mr Mark Solly, partner in the Manx office of accountancy firm Moore
Stephens, said people considering such a move should, 'get the best
available advice and not be afraid to pay for it. . . Having got that, they
must still be prepared to make their own decision - it is a very personal
decision.'
Such a move may mean giving up too much of their personal life, family,
friends, interests - or spending much of the tax they would save in
travelling to and from the island to continue pursuing these interests.
Mr Solly points out that those moving for capital gains tax reasons will
need to stay in the island for two to three years. The prime time to move is
just before April 5, to gain the whole of the following year as a non-UK
resident for tax purpose. This is likely to mean beginning house-hunting in
the island the previous autumn, and putting the UK home on the market. To
persuade the Inland Revenue that it is a genuine move, many doors must be
closed in the UK, such as resigning from clubs and trusteeships. The Revenue
must be satisfied that the centre of a person's life is in the Isle of Man.
For many men who make this move, island life can be quite full. 'These men
tend to be innovative, so they will get involved locally,' said Mr Solly.
But for some of their wives it is dismal. Though the island has a little of
everything, they miss the choice of good hotels, restaurants, shops, art and
concerts.
However, others get so involved in the life of the Isle of Man, with its
quiet, safety, beauty and temperate climate, that they stay on and make
permanent homes there.
Expansion of the business sector has led to an influx of executives who have
been transferred from another branch or changed companies to take up their
Manx-based position. Most find the island a delightful place to live, and
some refuse to be transferred back again at the end of theirs assigned term.
For those with children, the education system is good and the social
environment safe. A building boom over the past few years has produced a
good choice of houses, and many from the UK find property cheaper in the
island.
Such people are also free to travel to the UK as often as they wish, and so
do not suffer the feelings of deprivation experienced by some tax exiles.
With maximum income tax at 20 per cent, the island also attracts residents
who are high earners, such as racing driver Nigel ManseIl or
multi-millionaire Albert Gubay. A number of authors, particularly Mills and
Boon writers, choose the island for its low tax regime. But they live
quietly and shun publicity.
People in this category have chosen the Isle of Man from a range of low-tax
jurisdictions, so usually have few problems settling in. They also have
enough money to do the things they want, both in and out of the island.
The 1991 census showed a population increase of 5,000 over the previous 10
years, to 71,000, most of whom had come to work.
The island's new residents 'assist the economy in terms of their demand for
services,' said Mr John Cashin, the Manx treasurer. 'But this is not only
measured in cash terms. Were it not for this growth, the Manx population
would not enjoy the level of health and education services it currently
does.'
But capital expenditure has been needed by the Manx government, to enlarge
and update its infrastructure.
Mr Cashin explained that this include a large all-island sewage-disposal
system, extension to the hospital and health service properties, housing,
new schools, development at the harbour and airport, a new meat plant, and
the construction of a new electricity generating station.

FT  29 APR 92 / Survey of The Isle of Man (8): 'Cost effective with a sound
framework' - The island's status is not that of a flag of convenience. Its
ships fly the red ensign
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SUE STUART
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ISLE of Man's shipping register is more than 200 years old and is part
of the greater British register.
Until 1984, it was used for registering local vessels based in the island's
four harbours. Legislation enacted in 1984 saw the beginning of the
register's expansion to take on vessels from other areas.
The register has 130 ships, compared with 76 in 1986. Unlike Liberia or
Panama, which have 1,605 and 4,953 ships respectively, the Isle of Man's
status is not that of a flag of convenience. The ships fly the red ensign.
Mr David North, minister of the Manx department of highways, ports and
properties, said: 'The Isle of Man is recognised as being highly reputable
and totally acceptable to shipping companies that want to be offshore but
with the British flag. The island provides a cost-effective operation and
has a good legislative framework with its own merchant shipping acts.'
The legislation enacted in 1984 established the Manx Marine Administration,
with its own surveyors. This ensured that international conventions were
complied with by ships on the register. Ships qualifying as British must be
owned or managed by an Isle of Man-registered company that has its principal
place of business in the island.
The island also gained full Maritime Convention status, which means that
internationally recognised agreements for seafarers also apply to the Isle
of Man. Because of this, the Marine Administration can issue globally
acceptable international certificates.
Fees charged by the administration cover registration, survey and
certification of ships. The government has set the fees to cover only the
administrative costs involved. No additional registration tax or tonnage fee
is charged.
'The register does not make money for the island. But the Manx government is
looking to economic spin-offs, such as employment locally and the use of
financial services available in the island,' said Mr North. In the first 18
months after enactment of the legislation, about 100 British-registered
ships transferred to the Manx register. By 1988 there were 139, and since
then the register has remained at about 130, with some movements on and off.
Approximately 80 of the ships are ocean-going cargo vessels or tankers. The
balance are coastal ships, supply boats and tugs. The island also has a
growing yacht register, which currently holds around 300 vessels, ranging
from small yachts to large, luxury ocean-going vessels.
All ships are inspected by the administration surveyors when they first go
on the register, to ensure that they comply. Thereafter, inspection takes
place at least once every five years, though for some it is several times a
year.
Of 24 ship management companies based in the Isle of Man, eight are deemed
international.
'There are not the British companies left to transfer now,' said Capt David
Bruce, the Manx chief marine surveyor. 'We have begun looking beyond the UK
to expand the fleet base. The Manx register appeals to British operators,
because we follow British regulations and require British senior officers.
This may make expansion outside the UK slightly difficult.'
Capt Bruce initially targets Europe for further growth, and observes: 'Maybe
the requirement for British senior officers will be replaced by a
requirement for European officers.'
In December, the island introduced legislation permitting 'bareboat' charter
of vessels. This allows companies to split the jurisdictions for ownership
and operation of a vessel.
'This type of registration gives the ship-owner a flexible and attractive
package,' explained Capt Bruce.
Jurisdictions differ in their attractiveness, in considerations such as
mortgaging facilities or manning requirements. The vessels must comply with
all regulations for a Manx-registered vessel, except ownership requirements.
No ships have yet registered under this legislation, but Capt Bruce believes
this will change shortly. 'Once we have the first couple of vessels, then
the other companies will see that it works.'
Mr North sees the way forward as adoption of a package approach that will
appeal to shipping companies. He hopes to see them use the Isle of Man for
more of their activities, such as insurance, fund management and other
financial operations.
'This will provide the shipping community in the island with a broader base
and encourage expansion in the whole business community,' he said. 'We are
looking this year to joint marketing of the island as a centre for shipping
 -jointly with the Manx Treasury, insurance authority and Financial
Supervision Commission, as well as the island's private business sector.'
This package deal will be marketed not only to potential Isle of Man
clients, but also to companies with ships already on the Manx register that
currently obtain these additional services elsewhere.
Mr North sees shipping as a highly competitive market, but feels that the
island may be able to lure companies away from places such as Bermuda. 'The
Isle of Man has a lot to offer in terms of its regulatory authorities,' he
said.

FT  29 APR 92 / Survey of The Isle of Man (6): The big firms dig in - The
changing role of professionals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SUE STUART
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EXPANSION OF the island's financial services sector and its markets has
resulted in major changes in working practices for Manx-based professionals,
particularly accountants and lawyers.
In only a few years, the range of work has increased dramatically and now
includes a large proportion of international and complex matters.
For the island-based accountant or lawyer, this has meant choosing which
areas to cover and, in some cases, merging into larger practices that offer
various disciplines. It is no longer possible for a small practice to offer
all the services demanded by the island's increasingly international client
base.
One of the biggest changes for accountancy in the Isle of Man over the past
10 years has been the arrival and development of the practices of six major
international firms - KPMG Peat Marwick, Ernst a Young, Coopers &amp; Lybrand,
Pannell Kerr Forster, Price Waterhouse and Touche Ross. All now have a
substantial presence.
Mr Peter Vanderpump, partner in charge of the Manx office of Touche Ross,
said the move had been away from the core base of auditing accountancy. 'The
larger firms offer a much wider range of services, including consultancy,
offshore companies and trusts, and international tax planning for both
individuals and companies and liquidations,' he said.
The firm is liquidator for the Manx branch off BCCI, and Mr Vanderpump said
this involved a core team of three to four people full time. He feels the
island has become better known by people outside, and that the firm has
gained more recognition in the Isle of Man.
Touche Ross set up its Manx office in 1987 with 11 people. 'Initially,' said
Mr Vanderpump, 'everyone did some of everything. We are now 40 people in the
office and have become a much more structured organisation, with each
department having grown staggeringly.'
If the island continued to sell itself as a leading offshore centre, he
added, the next five years would see more growth.
However, Manx-based individuals and small businesses still need their
audits, and some practitioners have opted to stick with this client base.
One such accountant is Mr David Craine, a partner in the two-partner firm
Browne Craine.
Local audits make up 80 per cent of his firm's work is. 'We are a small
local practice and want to remain so,' he said.
But he has seen changes in his work over the years, and has found that there
is much more compliance work to be done for local clients than a few years
ago. 'Laws and regulations are changing all the time, and we have to keep up
to date.'
His clients have also had to change in attitude: 'Some of them we've had to
drag into the 20th century.'
Mr Craine's decision to service local auditing needs has not precluded the
firm's involvement in business outside the Isle of Man. It is a member of
Inpact, an association of small accountancy firms in 22 European countries.
Inpact members provide assistance and referrals to each other.
The island's five lawyers face the same change in demands, and many smaller
advocates' firms have merged. But Mr Alan Cough, of Cough &amp; Co, chose to
stay in sole practice and develop a specialisation in international
litigation.
He began sole practice in the island in 1976, when he dealt with everything,
from wills to boundary disputes. His first big international High Court
case, which lasted over two years, was in 1979.
From around 1986, island advocates have had a steady flow of international
work. 'Since then the size, number and complexity of cases has doubled every
year. I used to handle around 200 cases a year - now I personally deal with
five or six, which can take years to conclude,' he said. He has been
involved in internationally known cases such as Barlow Clowes, Polly Peck
and Rossminster. Mr Cough feels that his specialist approach has made his
practice one of the busiest in the island.
He has recently taken partners into the firm to assist with similar work,
trusts, receiverships and fund business. Future expansion may involve taking
on more advocates and solicitors.
Much of his firm's work is sorting out, through the courts, Manx trusts that
were badly formed some years ago, and encompasses a fully international
client base. He does not expect this work to decline for some years.
Mr John Crellin is senior partner in Cains, one of the island's largest and
oldest law firms. 'When I became senior partner 20 years ago, there were
four partners and 20 staff. Now we have eight partners, seven solicitors and
barristers and 70 staff,' he said.
The firm began finance sector business in the mid-1960s. 'Those were the
buccaneering days, when there was little regulation in the Isle of Man,' Mr
Crellin recalls. Now, demands are far more stringent and the firm has within
defined areas of specialisation within it. This includes three partners and
one advocate who practice law purely for the finance sector.
Mr Crellin feels that the proportion of local business has dropped, but by
specialisation Cains is able to serve both the finance sector and its
traditional clients.
He said the Manx bar was small in the 1950s, but its expansion had resulted
in a more credible bar which is more balanced in knowledge. Yet he believes
that all the island's lawyers are going to have to specialise and
individually to recognise their limitations in order to meet modern demands.

FT  29 APR 92 / Survey of The Isle of Man (2): More life companies enjoy tax
benefits - Investment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE MANX investment industry, once regarded as a disreputable dwelling for
dubious dealers, received the stamp of royal approval last week.
Clerical Medical International, one of the most successful life assurance
groups to have started on the island in the last decade, won a Queen's Award
for Export Achievement.
Mr Miles Walker, the chief minister, was delighted by the news, but added:
'It not only reflects their business acumen but also endorses the status
which the Isle of Man has earned and continues to earn as a growing
worldwide financial services centre.' This assessment is not over-stated.
Life assurance has been a particular success for the island, as life company
subsidiaries have taken advantage of tax privileges introduced to encourage
captive insurance companies. Insurers which do no business on the island are
exempt from tax.
Last year, Hafnia Prolific International, a subsidiary of the Danish life
group, became the latest to establish itself in Douglas.
By the end of its first year HPI had Pounds 50m in funds under management, a
figure which has since grown to around Pounds 80m. It now employs more than
20 people and is set to move to a new office, although the merger of Hafnia
with Skandia, whose subsidiary Royal Skandia is also based on the island,
may put a long-term question mark over its future.
The island's space for expansion has also helped. For example, Royal Life
International, the largest and longest established Manx life insurer, has
moved its 170 employees into a spacious new building on the southern tip of
the island - a marked improvement on the five offices the company used
touse. Royal Skandia's new office, in a renovated church which forms one of
Douglas' most distinctive landmarks, would also make most City-dwellers
green with envy.
Marketing has been the key to the expansion of CMI, and of Royal Life
International. They no longer concentrate on the UK expatriate market, but
instead look for 'international investors'. CMI now has more than 60 outlets
around the world. The tax position of the island allows high net worth
individuals, even if resident in their own country, to benefit, and
marketeers are finally learning to exploit this.
Hong Kong accounts for 25 per cent fo CMI's business and 35 per cent of
RLI's, and both are exploiting new markets in South America, the Gulf, and
Africa.
Allied Dunbar, which manages Dollars 177m on the island for 7,000 clients,
is also revamping its sales practices, with the creation of a new post in
charge of international marketing.
New concessions for non-life linked funds could be vital for the life
groups. The government wants fund management to provide an appropriate
'third leg' to their financial services industry, joining banking and
insurance.
The tax incentives introduced last year to bring in fund managers amount
almost to personal bribes. From April 6 this year, managers of Isle of Man
collective investment schemes have paid a concessionary 5 per cent rate of
income tax. This incentive will last at least until 2005.
Earlier this month Pierson Heldring &amp; Pierson, a subsidiary of ABN Amro
Bank, set up a fund administration subsidiary on the island, and cited tax
concessions as the main reason for its decision - music to the government's
ears.
The island also offers an attractive regulatory framework for managers
wanting to start innovative funds. The options are as follows:
Authorised schemes are designed to be directly comparable to UK authorised
unit trusts. This puts broad limits on the types of securities which can be
held, but allows Manx trusts, with their tax advantages, to be marketed on
the same basis as UK unit trusts.
In December last year, the Japan Securities Dealers Association in Tokyo
announced that these schemes were eligible for sale to Japanese investors.
Mr Donald Gelling, treasury minister, called this 'a further boost to our
efforts to develop the Island as the major 'Offshore Europe' funds location
of the 1990s'.
Restricted schemes are described by Mr Christopher Edmonds, collective
investments supervisor, as 'second tier' funds for offer to sophisticated
private investors. Examples would include managed futures and options funds,
or derivatives funds which offer a 'guarantee'.
These cannot be marketed with the same freedom as a unit trust, but they
could provide many firms with attractive options for their private clients.
There are now 68 such schemes, and regulators are hoping for a swift
expansion.
Exempted restricted schemes are essentially private, and of appeal only to
professional investors such as pension funds. The maximum number of
participants is 50, and these schemes may not be offered to the general
public.
But the Manx authorities hope they will help to funnel more funds in the
island's direction - for example, Mr Edmonds suggests that pension funds
could spread risk by collaborating on offshore derivatives funds using this
vehicle.
Closed-end schemes, similar to UK-based investment trusts, are also allowed,
as are limited partnerships. Since they are not regarded as collective
investment schemes, but as companies, they are not subject to strict
regulation.
Judging by progress so far, it seems that the Isle of Man's third financial
leg is alive and kicking.

FT  29 APR 92 / Survey of The Isle of Man (3): Depositors spot a snag -
Regulation: BCCI put the new scheme to an early test
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN THE centre of Douglas, a statue of Queen Victoria looks down
disapprovingly on the local branch of the Bank of Credit and Commerce
International.
The island's regulators know how she feels. BCCI cannot be said to reflect
too badly on the Isle of Man, given the number of jurisdictions which
allowed the bank's fraudsters free rein.
But BCCI did put the island's new deposit protection scheme to an unwelcome
early test.
The Manx scheme was started by the Financial Supervision Commission in
February last year. Deposits are protected up to 75 per cent of the first
Pounds 20,000 held, offering an effective maximum of Pounds 15,000, and this
also extends to the sterling equivalent in foreign currency deposits. The
island was justifiably proud that this offered exactly the same protection
as is offered under the UK's Banking Act.
Then came the BCCI shut-down. The Manx branch had approximately Pounds 90m
on deposit, and 5,000 depositors.
It at least gave the new consumer-protection regime an opportunity to show
itself in action. But this month, depositors spotted a problem and started
to complain.
Mr Jim Noakes, chief executive of the Financial Supervision Commission,
explains: 'There certainly has been unrest, but that's based on a
misconception. The regulations of the scheme require that, before the scheme
manager can pay compensation to anybody, that person must permit the scheme
manager to stand in his shoes, as far as his rights in the liquidation and
any other rights are concerned. The depositor is not forced to have
compensation if he doesn't want it.'
In the Isle of Man, the depositor's rights need to be assigned - in the UK,
according to Mr Noakes, there is no choice.
He adds that the FSC is only standing in depositors' shoes until it
retrieves as much money as it has already paid to depositors. If it manages
to retrieve any more, this will go in full to depositors.
The issue aroused depositors' ire, because a scheme proposed by the
government of Abu Dhabi would compensate depositors for 10 per cent of
amounts held on deposit. Those with Pounds 150,000 or more would therefore
do better under this than under the Manx scheme - hence their annoyance.
Mr Noakes has taken the dispute philosophically. The issue is still
relatively minor, when set against the advances the island's regulators have
continued to make in the last year. They are keen to stamp out any criminal
elements, but regulators are also at the forefront of the Isle of Man's
attempt to become a front-line financial centre.
The other big development of the last year has come through the Financial
Business Act, which aims, according to Mr Noakes, to broaden the scope of
regulation to affect the wider running of the system, rather than just
investor compensation. This includes investment professionals, such as
lawyers and accountants, and also intermediaries such as stockbrokers and
futures and options dealers.
The FSC recognised it had a problem of resources in finding the expertise to
regulate these specialist areas. Normally, this problem is overcome by
adopting strict licensing criteria before allowing companies to trade, and
therefore reducing the need for close supervision.
However, the FSC was determined not to stop specialist intermediaries and
professionals from coming to the island. Its solution could be very
attractive for overseas investors - negotiations are now in train with UK
self-regulatory organisations and representative professional bodies to set
up what Mr Noakes calls 'mutual assistance arrangements'.
This offers up the possibility of combining Manx taxes with protection from
such bodies as the English Law Society, the Securities and Futures Authority
and the Institute of Chartered Accountants.
He says: 'We are very hopeful, and we've had very positive responses from
all of them.'
Meanwhile, he says professional consultants on the island recognise that the
only other option - for the FSC to employ a specialist - would be much more
expensive.
This reveals an odd aspect of regulation on the Isle of Man. It is vital
that the regulators show their teeth, and use them to bite into any
wrongdoing. The island could not withstand another embarrassment on the
scale of the Savings and Investments Bank collapse.
But they are also working to expand the industry.
Mr Christopher Edmonds, supervisor of collective investment schemes for the
FSC, makes this explicit when talking about the island's innovative
'restrictive scheme' fund management regulations. 'I think we've got the
balance right between providing a measure of regulation whilst at the same
time providing the flexibility for the operators we've allowed into the
marketplace to develop and innovate the kind of products which their
customers are demanding.'
The current success of Manx financial services suggests Mr Edmonds is
correct - the regulators have found the right balance.

FT  29 APR 92 / Survey of The Isle of Man (4): 'Potential for expansion' -
Captive insurance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SUE STUART
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'The traditional marketplace for insurance is in turmoil. Lloyd's is under
severe pressure; some providers are withdrawing from the marketplace;
reinsurance capacity is under strain - if not withdrawn - and in some lines
of business prices are on an upward spiral. The rapidity of such
environmental change verges on the unprecedented, yet in its face the
marketplace for the captive, in satisfying a niche insurance need, has been
upwardly mobile.'
THIS ASSESSMENT comes from Dr Bill Hastings, the Isle of Man's insurance
supervisor.
Manx-based captive insurance companies continue to increase in numbers,
currently 117, and Dr Hastings and the industry feel there is much potential
for further expansion.
A captive is a wholly-owned subsidiary that ensures some or all of its
parent's risks. It may be administered by its own staff or by a captive
management company.
Captive insurance companies are recognised as being a more economically
efficient method of insuring corporate risks, and generally produce better
risk management within the parent. By placing them offshore, the company
also benefits from a low-tax regime.
The parent eliminates brokerage commission and can raise cover on some risks
that are difficult to place in the normal market.
'Management is increasingly aware of the economic benefits that such a
subsidiary brings to bear upon its organisation,' said Dr Hastings. 'Closer
lines of communication and a richer identification by management with what
is a rightful management tool can only enhance the control of risk and
thereby wealth.
'Beneficial awareness by management, the increasing pervasiveness of risk
and the failure of traditional market places to satisfy niche needs mean
that the demand by parents to form such insurers from traditional areas such
as the UK will continue - and worldwide.'
The island was particularly pleased last year to welcome the first captive
to come out of the former USSR. This was the Northern Shipping Insurance
Company. Its parent is the Northern Shipping Company of Archangel, which has
a fleet of about 130 ships.
This captive will provide hull and machinery insurance for Northern.
Previously, the Soviet mInistry of merchant marine met the cost of damage or
loss to the companies' ships. But the changes in that part of the world
meant that shipping companies had to look elsewhere for cover.
The captive is managed by Isle of Man Insurance Management; and Mr Peter
Vick, a director, regarded it as an exciting development which opened up
possibilities for further business from that part of the world.
Within a few months, a second captive from the former USSR, Baltic Shipping,
was formed under management by Isle of Man Insurance. A third, Azov, is
expected shortly.
There are 27 managers in the Isle of Man, including major companies, such as
Sedgwick, Willis Coroon, Alexander and Bowring. Managers feel there are
still many UK companies that could form captives, but also expect the
continental Europeans to begin to recognise the advantage of having their
own insurance company. The experience and expertise exists within the
island's financial services community to handle more captives than are
currently registered there.
The diversity of financial services available in the island add to its
attraction as a location for captives. All the ancillary needs of a company
can be met there.
'There can be no doubt, worldwide awareness is on an upward surge,' said Dr
Hastings. 'Significant maturing of attitude is to be found in many foreign
jurisdictions; demand is on the increase, and in response we find many more
potential offshore jurisdictions entering the arena.
'The danger in such growth, of course, is one of dilution, and it is for
this very reason that the Isle of Man will seek not only to retain its
forward position but also to set the trend.'

Agriculture

THE ISLAND's agricultural sector is being hit hard by the single European
market. Many technical changes are demanded of an industry which consists
largely of small farms run by some of the last bastions of Manx tradition.
The island is not part of the EC, but is linked to it through being a Crown
dependency of the UK. It makes no financial contribution to Europe and
receives no financial aid from it. But the special relationship allows the
island to market agricultural products in the EC.
At least half of the island's produce is exported to the UK; the rest
supplies the home market. In order to retain its ability to export, the
island must comply with EC regulations on production and processing of food.
There are 800 producers in the Isle of Man - 80 per cent with holdings of
less than 200 acres. Only 77 have more than 300 acres out of the total
117,000 acres farmed. Together with processing, the industry provides
employment for about 1,500 people.
Many farms are passed from father to son and have remained traditional mixed
farms - sheep, cattle, dairy cows, grain and roots for fodder, potatoes and
poultry. Fields are small, some only four acres, and bound by ancient dry
stone walls.
Farming methods on the smaller units are traditional. Crop rotation has
always been practised: dung from the cattle is spread on the land, and the
abundance of wildlife in the hedgerows reflects the minimal use of
chemicals.
In 1934, Manx farmers set up marketing associations. These consist of
representatives from the farming community and professional administrators.
There is only one slaughterhouse licenced. This is owned by the Manx
government and rented and operated by the Fatstock Marketing Association.
There is also a government-owned creamery, rented and operated by the Milk
Marketing Association.
Initially, farmers were pleased to get out of the open market in the island,
where prices were being depressed by rings of buyers. But with production
costs increasing - not least because of freight costs on all goods imported
that are needed in agriculture - they feel restricted by the limitations of
the marketing associations' abilities to market.
In the UK, producers can specialise and find a market for their products.
The strip of water between the Isle of Man and the UK makes it far more
difficult for a Manx producer to gain access to these markets at
economically viable prices.
The smaller farmer is locked into the system. Both his income and
expenditure are decreed by others. The downturn over the past 15 years has
not left him with the financial resources to institute any major changes in
his stock or methods. His best hope is to improve the quality of his produce
to gain the maximum return available in his limited market.
Those who have kept abreast of technical changes are not finding EC
compliance such a burden. By continually updating equipment and systems,
they have assured themselves a reasonable income and future.
But these farmers are in the minority, and most find compliance an
additional chore, on which they see no immediate return. Mr John Corrin, the
Manx agricultural minister, said: 'There has not been intensive farming in
the island, and stock levels have not increased much over the years. The
Manx farmer does not feel he has contributed to European overproduction, and
he feels he has a right to continue his traditional farming system.'
The Manx government resolved to support the island's farmers to a similar
level as their EC counterparts are supported. 'Though this does not
necessarily mean the same support schemes as in the EC, in totality the
result will be the same,' said Mr Corrin. 'However, we must be mindful not
to
give our farmers an advantage over those in the EC. 'Though we have
limitations in continuity of supply, because of small production levels, if
our produce is high quality in a limited range there is a market for it.'
The government is negotiating to assist the marketing associations, which
are criticised by the farmers for poor results. 'It is in government's
interests that the associations work effectively, so that farmers do not
look to government to make up their shortfall,' said Mr. Corrin.
Investment of Pounds 5m is also planned by the Manx government for a new
meat plant. The island's existing abattoir and processing plant cannot be
altered to comply permanently with EC requirements.
The proposed plant, which will be one of the smallest EC-complying plants in
Britain, will be operational by 1994. With abattoirs closing throughout
Britain, this is regarded as a vote of confidence by the Manx government in
its agricultural industry. But the government also knows that collapse of
the industry would create a large unemployment problem in the island. It
could also leave thousands of acres of untended land.

FT  29 APR 92 / Survey of The Isle of Man (1): A thriving outpost few want
to leave
</HEADLINE>

   By JOHN AUTHERS

<TEXT>
The island enjoys political stability; fund management is growing fast,
fuelled by generous tax breaks; banking and insurance already have a sure
hold.  Yet some people resent the growing power of the EC, while others fear
that a mainland government committed to cutting income tax may reduce the
island's attractiveness to UK citizens. Tourism is seen as a possible area
for expansion, though it might create only temporary jobs
TIMES MAY be hard in the rest of the British isles, but in the Isle of Man,
the Celtic outpost of the Irish Sea, business is booming.
One of the prime reasons will be familiar to anybody who watched the UK
election campaign - personal taxation.
Mr Donald Gelling, the Manx finance minister, presented his budget earlier
this month, and the tax rates he announced would certainly have been enough
to win the UK election.
The basic rate of income tax is 15 per cent, with a top rate of 20 per cent.
Tax relief at the top rate is available on all loans from Manx lenders -
that includes credit cards as well as mortgages - and personal allowances
before tax is payable stand at Pounds 6,000 for those who are single, and
Pounds 12,000 for married couples. A family unit can earn Pounds 28,000
before incurring tax at the top rate of 20 per cent.
No wonder so many businessmen who go to the island never want to leave.
The UK election may have removed the possibility of higher tax rates, which
would automatically have increased the attractions of investing offshore;
but Labour had been keen to attack the island's tax privileges, so the Manx
business community was not distraught.
Financial services continue to grow, and unemployment, while it has risen
slightly to around 1,200, is still at a level which any UK politician would
describe as 'full employment'.
Leaps forward in the regulation of the financial services sector, since the
establishment of the Financial Supervision Commission in 1983, have
triggered a fast expansion in the island's financial services industry. It
was the first offshore jurisdiction to win designated status under the UK's
Financial Services Act of 1988, which effectively recognised that the Manx
offered the same degree of investor protection as the British.
Fund management is growing fast on the island, fuelled by generous tax
breaks announced last year, and operative since the beginning of this month.
Banking and insurance already have a sure hold.
Political stability is profound, as the Tynwald, the Manx parliament, sails
serenely into its second millennium. It is the longest continuous parliament
in the world. Overcrowding is not a problem, and shows no signs of becoming
one - the island's 70,000 population is roughly equal to that of Jersey, but
spread over an area six times as large. It is also well educated, providing
a valuable pool of labour.
But not everything in the garden is lovely. The budget also announced a
slight deficit this year, and Mr Gelling provided a Pounds 4m 'kick start'
for the industrial sector. And there are broader causes for concern.
Ugly sentiments have been stirred up by a confrontation with the European
Community. The Tynwald has never got round to legalising homosexuality, to
which many of the islanders, who tend to have a very traditionalist moral
outlook, object strongly. But the island is a party to the convention of the
European Court of Human Rights, which upholds gay rights.
Many who had no quarrel with gay rights objected to new laws being forced on
the island by the European Court.
Attempts by the political leadership to pass legislation allowing
homosexuality between consenting adults therefore led to passionate rows in
the Tynwald, physical threats against those who led the drive for reform,
and some deeply reactionary letters to local newspapers.
Following a majority of two in the House of Keys, the Tynwald's equivalent
of the Commons, reform now seems certain to reach the statute book without a
constitutional showdown. But islanders have been greatly embarrassed by some
of the coverage of the incident which appeared in UK tabloids.
There is also cause for concern on the commercial front.
Mr Colin Coates, a partner with Touche Ross, made some heretical comments in
a presentation to the island's business community immediately after the
budget. The reaction to his arguments was divided, but he seemed to prove
that the island cannot yet afford to rest on its laurels. In particular, the
growing power of Europe could pose a threat.
This is what Mr Coates had to say: 'Close to home, we have a Tory Government
committed to reducing income tax, to limiting the impact of inheritance tax,
and to allow the creators of wealth to retain a greater portion of that
wealth. This must reduce the fiscal attractiveness of the island to UK-based
individuals.
'The extent to which the European Community is a market for our financial
and professional services is debatable. Offshore centres within the EC, and
more are entering the fray, have considerable marketing advantages, as
evidenced by UK groups establishing in Luxembourg rather than the Isle of
Man and Channel Islands. It does not appear that EC tax harmonisation is
going to affect these centres for the foreseeable future.'
Mr Michael Gates, corporate development officer for the island, rejects this
argument more or less in its entirety. He points out that the current
advantages flowing to Luxembourg and Dublin within the EC cannot last
forever, while Manx legislation has ensured that the island's funds need not
miss out on the opportunities for cross-border marketing of mutual funds.
Meanwhile, the UK's current massive borrowing requirement should be enough
to ensure that a hefty tax differential is maintained, according to Mr
Gates.
Should the UK opt to raise VAT, the differentials could be widened. The
island has to levy VAT at the same rate as the mainland, so this would
provide an increase in the government's income, allowing further cuts in
personal taxes.
So Mr Coates' final suggestion is for renewed investment in an unfashionable
area - tourism. He said: 'If Tory policy succeeds, a growing number of
people in the UK will enjoy higher levels of disposable income. The island
is on their doorstep. It is a beautiful island with incredible potential to
market its historical sites and its recreational facilities. Every weekend
the island should be crawling with tourists taking two- or three-day breaks.
When it gets to the point when we start to complain about the tourists, that
is when the industry will be a success.'
There is some force in this argument, and Mr Miles Walker, the chief
minister, is keen to expand the island's tourist industry. Take away the
financial services sector, and the island looks more like Cornwall than
Jersey or Guernsey.
Wild, starkly beautiful Celtic countryside leads to dramatic cliffs and long
beaches. The island's bizarre climate means that palm trees grow in relative
profusion.
The population has been deprived of its old mining industry - just like the
Cornish - while its fisheries and agriculture have contracted. Meanwhile, it
clings to a Celtic heritage, including the remnants of a native language.
Some businessmen enthused to Mr Coates' ideas, saying the Isle of Man should
be known as 'activity island'.
But the suspicion remains that jobs in tourism would be temporary. The
terrace of Edwardian guesthouses in Douglas, which currently services the
influx of visitors for the annual TT motor-cycle races, would have
difficulty accommodating a large tourist trade, and heavy investment in
infrastructure would be necessary first.
Mr Gates is keener to look for other areas of development. He points to the
'ball park' figures of the island's success - employment in the financial
sector has trebled in 10 years, despite computers, bank deposits on the
island total Pounds 9.5bn, and the number of captive insurers has increased
from three to 117 since 1981.
His interests now are to encourage more fund managers to come to the island,
and to persuade executives to use it as a base for international holding
companies. A review of company taxation was announced in the budget, while
the maximum registration fee for a company wishing to capitalise itself on
the island was slashed from Pounds 50,000 to Pounds 5,000.
The Manx are adamant that Europe is not a threat - indeed, they are hunting
new business in the Far East and in North America. Their role model now is
not Jersey, Guernsey, or even Luxembourg. It is Bermuda.
According to Mr Gelling, the Isle of Man could play the same role for Europe
which Bermuda does for the US: 'The island expects that it will become one
of the key 'gateways' for funds flowing into the EC's major financial
centres from the Far East, North America and elsewhere.'
The problems raised by Touche Ross remain to be confronted, but the island
cannot be faulted in the determination of its attempt to establish itself in
this key world role.

FT  29 APR 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures and Options Trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TURNOVER in stock index futures improved on the recent meagre levels,
although there was little in the way of strong features to help traders
deal, writes Joel Kibazo.
A quiet trading start in the June FT-SE contract soon gave way to large
selling, reported to have been led by BZW, which sent the contract falling
from its opening level of 2,682 to 2,666 by mid-morning.
A good bout of two-way business followed, until the opening of Wall Street,
when June followed the US market lower. However, it recovered shortly after,
with a small squeeze seen just before the market closed.
June ended at 2,680, down 10 on Monday's close and a point below its
estimated fair value premium to cash of about 18. Turnover was favourable at
7,276 lots.
On the London traded options market, the brisk trade in Midland Bank, which
may soon be the subject of a bid from Lloyds Bank, contributed substantially
to the day's total turnover of 35,961. The FT-SE 100 option had a total of
14,190 contracts transacted.
Among stock options, Midland recorded a day's total of 7,158 lots. This was
followed by Marks and Spencer at 1,748, and British Steel at 1,430.

FT  29 APR 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Paris CAC-40 index closes
above 2,000
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
PARIS bucked an easier continental trend as a series of suspensions
enlivened trading, writes Our Markets Staff.
PARIS broke above 2,000 on the CAC-40 index after numerous attempts in the
last week. Several stocks were suspended, pending announcements. The CAC-40
index ended up 10.90 at 2,006.62, its highest close since July 1990, in
turnover of FFr2.1bn.
Paribas shot up FFr19.90 or 4.9 per cent to FFr419 as the suspension of
Ciments Francais fanned speculation that it was about to sell all or part of
its stake in the cement company to Holderbank of Switzerland or Hanson of
the UK. Holderbank denied the story and there was no comment from the other
companies.
Analysts said that Paribas was likely to part with Ciments Francais, held
indirectly through Poliet, since it was under pressure to improve its
earnings in 1992 after its poor results last year.
Schneider, its parent Spep, and its subsidiary Merlin Gerin were all
suspended amid talk that the group's structure would be simplified through a
series of share swaps.
Total rose FFr11.30 or 4.6 per cent to FFr258.70 on renewed optimism about
its Colombian oil find while Elf added FFr6.90 to FFr384.
FRANKFURT weakened further as strike action widened. The DAX index shed 6.28
to 1,735.94 while the FAZ index, calculated at midsession, slipped 2.13 to
706.33. Turnover rose to DM5.4bn from DM4.4bn.
Hoechst, which reported a 26 per cent decline in first quarter group pre-tax
profit, fell DM5 to DM257.30. The figures were worse than expected but the
company expects a turnround in the next few months.
Other chemical stocks followed Hoechst lower with Basf shedding DM1.60 to
DM248.30 and Bayer down 70 pfg at DM288.30.
Linotype-Hell was one of the day's most impressive gainers, advancing
DM26.50 or 6.8 per cent to DM416, following a presentation on Monday at
which the company gave a positive forecast for 1992.
MILAN failed to hold on to early gains as a poor fixing in Generali, down
L110 to L30,000, prompted investors to take profits on industrial shares.
The Comit index fell 0.85 to 507.58 in turnover estimated at near Monday's
L88.8bn.
Pirelli officially closed L25 higher at 1,430 but dropped to L1,392 after
hours. Fiat fell to L5,020 in late trading after being fixed L124 higher at
L5,109. Benetton lost another L200 to L13,400.
Stet continued to drop on foreign selling, losing L45 or 2.1 per cent to
L2,055. The company has denied rumours of a capital increase.
ZURICH fell in light trading after Monday's public holiday. The SMI index
was 15.2 lower at 1,859.5.
Most of the decline was attributable to UBS and Alusuisse going ex-dividend.
UBS bearers closed down SFr150 at SFr3,760 and Alusuisse bearers fell SFr46
to SFr936.
Sandoz shed SFr20 to SFr2,600 after announcing a 17 per cent increase in
first quarter sales.
AMSTERDAM was little changed in lacklustre trading. The CBS Tendency index
advanced 0.2 to 128.1 in turnover of Fl 623.7m.
Akzo was up Fl 1.50 at Fl 156.10 ahead of today's first quarter sales
figures. Some analysts are forecasting positive 1992 earnings. DSM was Fl
1.50 stronger at Fl 112.70.
Elsevier gained Fl 1.80 to Fl 113.40 on foreign buying. KNP weakened Fl 1.50
or 3.1 per cent to Fl 46.70, although off the day's low of Fl 46, after the
paper manufacturer said that earnings for the first six months of 1992 will
be below the same period last year.
Amev was down 30 cents at Fl 53 after forecasting a difficult year ahead.
STOCKHOLM fell on profit-taking and interest rate worries. The Affarsvarlden
General index eased 7.5 to 979.6 in moderate turnover of SKr496m after
SKr784m.
The decline was led by Asea, with the B shares falling SKr5 to SKr364 and
the A shares down SKr6 to SKr364.
BRUSSELS saw Delhaize fall another BFr320 or 3.4 per cent at BFr9,040. The
Bel-20 index dropped 4.12 to 1,206.26.
MADRID's general index lost 0.76 to 249.17 in turnover of Pta11bn.
Telefonica rose Pta15 to Pta1,055 with 2m shares traded.
ISTANBUL fell for the fourth consecutive day. The 75-share index declined
37.93 or 1.02 per cent to 3,679.95.

FT  29 APR 92 / World Stock Markets: Tax changes raise Swedish hopes -
Government initiatives are likely to attract more foreign investment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Stockholm equity market is in an optimistic mood as the combination of
proposed tax changes, the lifting of restrictions on foreign ownership, and
an upturn in the US economy seem likely to attract further international
investment in Swedish shares.
Foreigners have been eager buyers of Swedish equities - they snapped up a
net SKr11.2bn (Dollars 1.9bn) last year - and the liberalisation of share
ownership in Swedish companies could well increase their appetite for this
corner of Europe. In the first quarter, foreigners have been net buyers of
the country's shares worth SKr3.2bn, compared with SKr1.1bn in the year-ago
period.
While the centre-right government's supplementary budget last Friday
contained some grim economic forecasts - including expectation of a widening
budget deficit in the 1992-93 tax year and a further 0.4 per cent fall in
GNP in 1992 - it promised some welcome tax cuts for Swedish industry.
The government's plans to abolish taxes on electricity and fuel for
industrial use is expected to benefit energy-intensive sectors such as
forestry, chemicals and mining.
The market had been expecting the removal of the energy taxes for the last
month, so the announcement did not have a noticeable effect on the stock
market on Friday. However, it is expected to have significant long-term
benefits.
One securities house estimates that the removal of the energy taxes could
add as much as SKr500m to the combined profits of Sweden's three main
forestry companies (Stora, SCA and MoDo), giving them a forecast combined
profit of SKr3.5bn in 1993.
Other analysts point out, however, that while the removal of the energy
taxes is good news for the forestry sector, it comes at a time when the
industry is still suffering from the effects of global overcapacity.
Only last month, Mr Bo Berggren, chief executive of Stora, Sweden's largest
forestry company, warned that 1992 would be another difficult year, crushing
hopes of a speedy recovery in the sector. 'Just removing the energy tax will
not solve the forestry sector's problems,' comments one broker.
Companies with mining interests are likely to enjoy a more obvious benefit
from the lower energy costs. One such example is Electrolux, one of the
world's leading white goods manufacturers which also owns Granges, an
aluminium producer.
Another company which will gain from the change is SSAB, the
state-controlled steel concern which is selling some of its shares to the
public this spring as part of the government's privatisation programme.
SSAB's shares are already listed in Stockholm, and have climbed 31 per cent
since the start of the year, against the market's overall gain of 8 per
cent. Brokers say SSAB's share price increased by 3 per cent last week,
helped by leaks that the government would abolish the energy tax.
The government's decision to scrap a real estate tax, also formally
announced in last Friday's supplementary budget but flagged well before, is
expected to help the property sector and, indirectly, the banks, which have
been burdened by heavy losses on loans to real estate companies.
Bank shares, which have dropped by 16 per cent since the start of 1992,
showed a slight recovery during April. 'With the removal of the real estate
tax, maybe the fall in property prices will stop,' says one analyst,
although he warns that any revival in the sector will probably take quite a
long time.
Apart from those companies likely to benefit from the lifting of the real
estate and energy taxes, buying interest has focused mainly on cyclical
stocks, following signs of a recovery in the US economy.
Brokers note gains of 37 per cent in Volvo's share price, 20 per cent in the
ball-bearing producer SKF, and 18 per cent in the specialty steel group
Sandvik, since the start of the year. All of these companies have a high
proportion of their sales outside Sweden, so the prospect of a recovery in
the US is welcome news.
During Sweden's recession, many of the large companies were forced to
drastically cut costs, leaving them leaner and more efficient - and more
likely to perform strongly once the Swedish economy recovers.

FT  29 APR 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Central bank support for
yen helps to lift Nikkei

INVESTMENT trust buying and Bank of Japan intervention to support the yen
lifted the Nikkei average in light pre-holiday trading yesterday, writes
Neil Weinberg in Tokyo.
The 225-issue index ended 76.88 up at 17,527.40 after a day's low of
17,379.16 and high of 17,606.78. The Topix index of all first section shares
rose 6.15 to 1,319.00 and advances outnumbered declines by 564 to 379, with
192 issues unchanged.
Volume picked up to 250m shares from Monday's meagre 200m. Tokyo is closed
today for a public holiday. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index firmed 1.56 to
1,075.59.
The market improved late in the session on the central bank's moves to
strengthen the yen after the weekend meeting of Group of Seven nations ended
with calls for a stronger Japanese currency.
Investment trusts set up this week to funnel corporate funds back into the
stock market also offered some support, although the amounts collected came
in well below target. The trusts are among Finance Ministry measures to
bolster the market and could lead to a lifting of the ban on corporate share
repurchases.
Mr Jason Fames of James Capel Pacific said there was talk of a two-tier
market emerging, in which leading electricals and other manufacturing issues
continued to do well while bank shares languished.
'The question is whether industrial stocks can go up faster than others
fall,' he added. 'Right now the market is at a balancing point, waiting for
the economy to recover or the Bank of Japan to ease interest rates, but I do
not think that is about to happen.'
Speculative and incentive-backed issues fared well, with Morinaga Milk, the
market volume leader, gaining Y20 to Y791 and Teac Y10 to Y1,030. NTT moved
up Y8,000 to Y636,000 amid local reports that the minimum trading unit of
Tokyo's most expensive issue might be reduced.
The yen's strength prompted investors to buy into blue chip issues, which
have fared well in recent sessions. Sony put on Y20 to Y4,330 and Toyota
Motor Y10 to Y1,460. The department stores sector continued to decline on
weak earnings and sales prospects. Mitsukoshi fell Y19 to register a year's
low of Y801.
Bank issues traded mixed amid further evidence that their recent rally had
ended. Dai-Ichi Kangyo rose Y60 to Y1,380 while Mitsubishi Bank was off Y30
to Y1,770. Most other financials were lower, with Nikko Securities down Y21
at Y623 and Tokio Fire and Marine off Y3 at Y995.
Signs of continued weakness in the Japanese economy appeared after the
market's close with the release of March industrial production figures. They
showed a 2.8 per cent fall from February, compared to a forecast of a 0.9
per cent decline.
Roundup
THE PACIFIC Rim was mixed yesterday, with the spotlight remaining on Hong
Kong. It has risen 11 per cent over the last eight sessions.
HONG KONG advanced strongly after news that Lloyds Bank, of the UK, was
considering a bid against HSBC's agreed takeover of Midland Bank. HSBC
climbed HKDollars 1.25 to HKDollars 42.75.
The Hang Seng index gained a net 51.62 at 5,423.39 after earlier attaining
an all-time high of 5,442.90. Turnover reached HKDollars 3.67bn, against
HKDollars 3.16bn.
SINGAPORE rose on bargain hunting. The Straits Times Industrial index
finished 13.53 ahead at 1,426.64 in turnover of SDollars 85.7m.
SEOUL retreated on profit-taking. The composite index closed 10.82 off at
597.24 in turnover of Won394.8bn. Manufacturing, securities, bank and
construction stocks posted the biggest losses.
AUSTRALIA closed slightly higher before today's CPI figures for March. The
All Ordinaries index rose 2.9 to 1,605.8 in turnover of ADollars 179.2m.
Forecasts for annual inflation range between 1.9 to 2.3 per cent and
analysts expect a cut in interest rates later this week.
NEW ZEALAND lost ground, the NZSE-40 index slipping 6.82 to 1,447.15.
BOMBAY plummeted on speculative selling as trading resumed after a week-long
boycott by traders. The BSE index lost 570.42, or 12.8 per cent, to
3,896.90.
TAIWAN advanced in active trade, the weighted index adding 37.50 at 4,523.95
in turnover of TDollars 24.3bn.
MANILA moved ahead, led by a strong performance by Philippine Long Distance
Telephone. The composite index rose 20.61 to 1,211.48 in combined turnover
of 190.29m pesos. PLDT climbed 25 pesos to 930 pesos.
KUALA LUMPUR was featureless. The composite index regained 2.60 to 583.62 in
turnover of MDollars 62.9m. BANGKOK's SET index fell 6.41 to 768.11.

FT  29 APR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Row over cereal prices
threatens CAP reforms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LUXEMBOURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SHARP differences between the European Commission and the current Portuguese
presidency of the European Community last night cast a new shadow over
Brussels' well-advanced plans to reform the Common Agricultural Policy.
The presidency, in its fourth attempt to to reach a compromise on the
reform, wants to limit the cut in subsidised cereals prices to 27 per cent
over three years.
This compares with the 35 per cent reduction called for in the original
proposals of Mr Ray MacSharry, the EC agriculture commissioner, and the 30
per cent compromise suggested by Portugal last month.
Further slippage in planned cuts on cereals subsidies increases the risks of
failure of the Uruguay Round of the negotiations on the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade. EC wheat exports are the main obstacle to a Gatt
agreement, which would liberalise large new sectors of world trade.
The US will not move from its demand that the EC not only cut farm subsidies
by 36 per cent over five years, but cut the volume of subsidised produce it
exports by 24 per cent.
The community is prepared to offer a 20 per cent cut in volume - a
difference of about 3m tonnes of wheat, the most politically volatile
commodity left to stabilise.
However, the cereals chapter is the centrepiece of the CAP reform, and
Brussels believes too much fiddling with it could unravel the package as a
whole, and nullify its effects in the arable sector, where high productivity
growth would create new EC budgetary problems and trade frictions.
'The reduction in the price of cereals (proposed by the EC presidency) is
not near what we regard as necessary,' a senior commission official said
yesterday.
'We have to distance ourselves from the commission's original proposals in
order to get a consensus among the member states,' a spokesman for the
presidency countered.
The failure of last week's EC-US summit to achieve a breakthrough on the
Uruguay Round also means that some EC member states will try to slow-pedal
on CAP reform, arguing that the commission's plans risk going beyond what
Gatt will require of the EC farm sector.
As a three-day farm council began in Brussels yesterday, these uncertainties
made it most unlikely that any agreement would be possible before June at
the earliest.

FT  29 APR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: USDA acts quickly to beat
African snail threat
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US Department of Agriculture (USDA) has set up a 'dragnet' to capture
giant African snails, which it believes may get free in the US, reproduce
swiftly and begin feeding voraciously on American vegetables and fruits.
In the week since it raised the alarm, the department has 'recovered' more
than 125 of the fist-sized snails, of the species Archacatina Marzinata,
mostly from the relative safety of pet shops. Only one suspect was sighted
in the fields - in Kansas - but it turned out to be an indigenous broccoli
snail.
Ms Roberta McCorkle, a USDA spokesperson, said the creatures looked like 'a
slime puddle' or 'melted chocolate' when they left their shells to feed.
They reproduced easily, she said, although they did need partners.
The snails were illegally imported from Lagos, the commercial capital of
Nigeria, from a broker through John F. Kennedy Airport in New York,
according to Mr Glen Lee, a department official. The shipments were listed
as reptiles and therefore not seen by USDA inspectors.
They are popular as terrarium pets, and department officials are worried
that they may be freed by their owners, intentionally or - as was the case
with the costly gypsy moth - by accident. In the 1970s it took the
agricultural authorities nearly six years to eradicate a similar giant
African snail, and the final bill was estimated at between Dollars 5m and
Dollars 7m.
Department officials are now ploughing through pet store records to
determine just how many of the threatening gastropods were imported and
distributed.
They are asking owners to turn in their snails for 'humane' disposal.

FT  29 APR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Minnova outlines its plans for
Izok Lake project
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MONTREAL
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CANADA'S Minnova mining company hopes to build up reserves at its Izok Lake
copper-zinc-lead project in northern Canada to justify a 1993 construction
go-ahead and a production start late in 1996, according to Mr David Watkins,
Minnova's president.
The company, controlled by Noranda, bought Izok Lake from Falconbridge last
year for CDollars 20m (Pounds 9.5m) and recently sold 40 per cent to the
German-controlled Metall Mining for CDollars 17m. Minnova is the operator
and puts development costs at CDollars 250m or more for the open pit mine
and port near Coppermine, Northwest Territories, 2,000 miles north of
Calgary.
The company has three drills working at Izok Lake. It will also add reserves
from two other properties it owns in the area.
Estimated reserves are 13.5m tonnes grading an average 3.2 per cent of
copper, 14.4 per cent of zinc, 1.3 per cent of lead and 74 grammes a tonne
of silver. 'We're thinking in terms of a mine life of 25-30 years,' said Mr
Watkins.
Speaking after Minnova's annual meeting, he called Izok lake 'one of the
world's major high-grade base metal properties'. Other companies with mines
or undeveloped properties nearby may want to invest in it, he added.
Minnova planned a mill at the mine site and would truck the concentrates 150
miles to port, Mr Watkins said. They would be stockpiled and pulled out
during an eight-month shipping season in a 50,000 tonnes Class IV
ice-breaking bulk carrier, via the Northwest Passage.
The Point Barrow route around the northern tip of Alaska would have a two
months season only, Mr Watkins said. The vessel would also pull nickel
concentrates from northern Quebec. The high-grade Raglan mines have been
awaiting development for 25 years.

FT  29 APR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: De Beers boosts gem marketing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FACED WITH a sharp fall in diamond sales, De Beers, the South African group
which controls more than 80 per cent of the rough (uncut) diamond market, is
lifting its promotional budget for the gems by 9 per cent this year to a
record Dollars 164m, the group's chairman, Mr Julian Ogilvie Thompson,
announced yesterday.
Mr Ogilvie Thompson also reported that De Beers' diamond sales were
improving, but he expected them to fall by 15 per cent in dollar terms
during the first half of 1992 compared with the same months last year.
This follows a 6 per cent fall last year, to Dollars 3.927bn.
Mr Jeremy Pudney, director of De Beers' Central Selling Organisation,
responsible for consumer promotion and advertising, said the increase in the
promotional budget - 5 per cent in real terms - would be aimed mainly at
Europe and south-east Asia.
The group will next month launch its biggest television advertising campaign
in Europe for diamonds. The number of people in Europe buying diamonds had
doubled in the past 10 years, but they were spending much less per head than
US buyers. 'We are trying to get a greater share of Europe's wealth,' Mr
Pudney said.
About Dollars 15m will be spent on the European television promotion, mainly
in the biggest markets: France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the UK.
A stroke of luck will enable the campaign to be launched in the UK on May 4
during a showing of the James Bond film, Diamonds Are Forever.
De Beers is also studying carefully the Chinese and Indian markets, where Mr
Pudney says there is a 'cultural affinity' for diamonds.
The group has been advertising in China for some years, and now believes
sales can be stimulated in the Guangdong region, close to Hong Kong.
One indication of the potential was that in the urban area, Guangzhon,
research showed that 98 per cent of households owned a television set.
At a briefing in London to coincide with the publication of De Beers' annual
report, Mr Ogilvie Thompson suggested that the diamond trade felt that the
present improvement in demand for polished stones would gather momentum.
'We expect sales for the second half of 1992 to be higher than the same
period last year. When the world economy resumes a reasonable rate of
growth, the diamond business can be confident of renewed prosperity,' Mr
Ogilvie Thompson said.

FT  29 APR 92 / International Capital Markets: Property bonds fail to share
election euphoria
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONE sector of the sterling bond market has not shared the positive mood
which has prevailed since the Conservative election victory: bonds issued by
property companies have slumped.
The problems facing high-profile companies such as Olympia &amp; York, Rosehaugh
and Speyhawk have cast a pall over a sector already embattled by the worst
property slump since the 1970s.
Even before the latest round of bad news, bonds issued by property companies
were already trading at wide yield spreads over government paper. This has
increased the cost of funds to property companies requiring funds.
For example, Land Securities paid a yield spread of 110 basis points over
gilts in September last year, having borrowed at a spread of just 40 basis
points in 1985.
The spate of bad news over the past two months has pushed yield spreads
wider still in many cases - although Land Securities bonds are an exception
to the rule.
Analysts point to two areas which are causing concern:
Bond market investors are concerned that property companies are being
pressured to issue long-dated bonds to replace short-term borrowings. Yet it
is not clear that institutional investors will be willing buyers of this new
supply of paper.
A recent analysis of the sector from Baring Securities said: 'All
property-related stocks have under-performed as the clearing banks have
stepped up pressure on these companies to replace their reliance on bank
debt with fixed longer term funding.'
Corporate financiers argue that the most likely issuers of sterling bonds
this year are medium-sized property companies keen to extend the maturity of
their debt, especially if gilt yields continue to fall. Many of the bigger
groups - such as Land Securities and MEPC - made substantial bond issues in
the second half of last year.
Property companies also face pressure from shareholders to maintain high
levels of dividend payouts, even where cash flow has been squeezed by the
slump.
For example, Hammerson recently held its dividend at 20.5p, despite a 23 per
cent fall in net asset values. Earlier this year, MEPC faced criticism for
increasing its full-year dividend from 19p to 20p despite a similar 23 per
cent fall in the value of its property portfolio.
Analysts are concerned that a decision to channel cash to equity holders may
not always be in the interest of bond holders. Hammerson this week had its
long-term credit rating cut from A2 to A3 by Moody's Investors Service, the
US credit rating agency.
Explaining the downgrading, the rating agency said that Hammerson's
'retained cash flow is severely curtailed due to a high dividend payout at a
time when earnings are decreasing'.
A number of other big property companies, such as British Land, Land
Securities and Great Portland Estates, are due to report full-year results
in May and June. It remains to be seen whether these companies will maintain
or increase dividend payments.
However, the combination of negative factors means that property companies
needing to borrow from the bond market will probably have to pay a premium
to get new issues away.
For example, Hammerson recently doubled the size of its outstanding Pounds
100m bond issue maturing 2013. The new bonds were offered to investors at a
20 basis point premium to the outstanding debt, but still received a
lukewarm reception. The bonds fell further yesterday following the
announcement of the downgrading.
Yet even smaller property companies have been able to borrow, by pricing in
line with market expectations and offering security. In the past month, Tops
Estates and A&amp;J Mucklow, both of which have a market capitalisation less
than Pounds 100m, have raised long-dated secured funding. Some investors
clearly believe that bonds issued by property companies represent good value
at current yield spreads.

FT  29 APR 92 / International Bonds: Sterling demand fuels interest in EIB
offering
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STRONG demand for sterling securities continued to feed through into the
Eurosterling bond market, fuelling interest in the European Investment
Bank's Pounds 200m 10-year offering, arranged by Salomon Brothers.
The 9 per cent bonds were considered aggressively priced to yield just 9
basis points above the 9 3/4 per cent gilt due 2002. With little 10-year
paper for sovereign or supranational borrowers outstanding in the 10-year
sector, the lead manager said the pricing was based on perceived demand
rather than secondary market levels.
The deal sold out swiftly, boosted by strong interest from German investors,
who are refocusing on the sterling market due to the uncertainty afflicting
their domestic market. Some German mutual funds prefer Eurobonds to gilts
for tax reasons. Italian investors, for whom the EIB is exempt from
withholding tax, were also active buyers.
Some international bond fund managers, however, found the 9 basis point
spread insufficient compensation for the loss of liquidity, compared with
the gilts market. When Eurobond yields are so close to gilts, spread players
are less likely to participate, since there is, at least in theory, less
scope for spreads to tighten. However, the EIB deal had tightened to six
basis points by yesterday's close, against a flat gilts market.
Also in the sterling market, the UK subsidiary of General Motors Acceptance
Corporation launched a Pounds 75m issue due December 1995, via Baring
Brothers.
Neither the GMAC nor the EIB deal (which used a deferred rate setting
structure) were swapped. Tight swap spreads in the sterling sector continue
to deter borrowers without a need for fixed-rate sterling.
'A lot of UK companies are looking at the market, but those who want
floating-rate funds are not meeting their targets, and those who are keen to
lock in fixed-rate funds are waiting for rates to fall further,' said one
banker.
However, there is also concern among some UK companies not to miss the wave
of demand which offers a welcome opportunity to diversify from bank funding.
In the dollar sector, Hydro-Quebec launched a Dollars 500m 10-year deal, via
Credit Suisse First Boston, priced to yield 85 basis points above the
10-year Treasury. Traders said the deal could have been brought at a tighter
spread in the US.

issues

<DATELINE>
   BERNE
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Swiss finance ministry said it would issue bonds on a regular monthly
basis, and publish a calendar, Reuter reports from Berne.
Mr Peter Thomann, Treasury chief, said the move was designed to ease the
absorption of federal bonds on to the market and avoid surprises.
The Treasury had until now had a calendar of new issues, but had not made it
public.
Mr Thomann said the Treasury planned to issue a further seven bonds this
year, totalling around SFr3bn, bringing the total for the year to a record
SFr5.6bn. Last year it issued SFr1.35bn, and the previous record was
SFr4.5bn in 1976.
Earlier it expected to double its issue of money-market certificates to
SFr4bn, but Mr Thomann said he was not sure this figure would be reached.
The certificates are one of the Treasury's chief short-term funding tools.
In a sign of the increasing importance of the bond market in federal
finances, the Treasury last year said it would issue fungible bonds to boost
market liquidity.

FT  29 APR 92 / International Company News: Hafnia wins support in Skandia
bid battle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   COPENHAGEN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
DANISH institutional investors are confident of winning enough support to
stop the takeover by Sweden's Skandia of Denmark's second-largest insurer,
Hafnia.
Two institutions, the LD Fund and Kommunernes Pensionsforsikring,
representing more than 10 per cent of Hafnia Holding's capital, have
submitted a request for an extraordinary meeting of shareholders to the
Hafnia board.
LD Fund says it has the support of 35 to 40 per cent of Hafnia's capital. It
said between 10 and 20 new shareholders were calling daily to promise
support.
However, a procedural battle, in which Hafnia's complex voting rules could
still prove an obstacle to the rebel shareholders, is expected.
The institutions are calling for a DKr1.5bn (Dollars 232.5m) increase in
Hafnia's capital through a rights issue. Promises to subscribe some DKr1bn
have already been received from local and foreign investors.
The equity injection would be designed to give Hafnia time to dispose of its
33.5 per cent shareholding in Baltica, a rival Danish insurer, and 14.8 per
cent of Skandia.
Among significant foreign shareholders to express dissatisfaction with
Skandia's bid are the French bank, Paribas, and UAP, the French insurance
group.
Mr Bjorn Wolrath, Skandia's chief executive, has condemned the move by
Paribas. He said Paribas had acted as consultant to Hafnia during alliance
negotiations between Skandia, Hafnia and the Norwegian insurer, Uni
Storebrand, in the months before the Skandia bid.
The Danish institutions say Skandia's DKr2.7bn bid is much too low, valuing
Hafnia's goodwill at about DKr600m. The bid is a swap of Hafnia shares for
Skandia shares carrying no voting influence.

NATIONAL Bank of Greece, the country's largest commercial bank, yesterday
reported record profits of Dr43.13bn (Dollars 224.5m) in 1991, after a
Dr12.27bn loss the previous year.
The state-owned bank's rapid improvement follows a gradual restructuring of
its loan portfolio as well as efforts to cut costs.
During 1991, the bank set up a new subsidiary, National Capital, to which it
is transferring non-performing loans, low-yielding shares and other non-core
assets.
Underlying growth in operating income rose by 65 per cent last year, while
costs grew by only 13.5 per cent, a gap which accounts for much of the
strong profit showing.
The bank, which accounts for almost 50 per cent of lending activity in
Greece, increased its provisions for doubtful debt last year to Dr45.92bn,
against only Dr7.02bn in 1990.
Provisions are equal to 8 per cent of loans, against 4.7 per cent in 1990.
The bank will transfer Dr17bn in profits to reserves. It will pay a Dr750
dividend per share, after passing for two successive years.

of coal and weaker rand
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   JOHANNESBURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
HIGHER local and export coal sales and a weaker rand boosted profits at
Randcoal, the coal arm of the Rand Mines group, in the six months to
end-March.
The higher volumes and weaker rand caused turnover to rise by 35 per cent to
R766.1m (Dollars 266.9m) while operating profit was 55 per cent higher at
R164.8m.
Net income more than doubled to R97.1m from R42.2m, but the increased number
of shares in issue limited earnings per share growth to 44 per cent, up to
95 cents from 66 cents a share.
Mr Allen Cook, chief executive of Randcoal - formerly Witbank Collieries -
said 6 cents per share of earnings was due to the first contributions to
Randcoal's earnings from Corgroup Investments and Manhattan Syndicate which
were acquired last year.
Export sales rose 21 per cent to 5.04m tonnes, inland sales were 20 per cent
up at 1.63m tonnes and sales to Escom 23 per cent higher at 7.4m tonnes.
The overall sales increase of 21.6 per cent mainly reflects the first-time
contributions of Corgroup and higher volumes from Douglas Colliery and
Welgedacht Exploration.
Mr Cook said that the inland market continued to weaken and that sales would
have fallen had the company not sold coal to a partner for export.
He added that there had been a substantial weakening in the spot price of
export steam coal since the beginning of the year.
The company's exposure to this was, however, limited as much of its
long-term business had already been concluded.
Earnings for the second half of the year are expected to be in line with
those for the first six months.

FT  29 APR 92 / International Company News: Toyo Shinkin Bank to be split up
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Toyo Shinkin Bank, the Osaka credit co-operative at the centre of a
multi-billion dollar loan fraud scheme last summer, is to be split up among
the Sanwa Bank and some 22 other credit co-operatives in the Osaka area.
Agreement to split the ailing bank came after the Sanwa Bank, which has
close links with Toyo, resisted government pressure to take over the entire
operation, which included some Y130bn (Dollars 976m) in losses stemming from
fraud.
The deal, arranged after mediation by the Bank of Japan and the Ministry of
Finance, will come as a relief to the Sanwa Bank, since the financial burden
arising from the scandal will be spread over a wide range of financial
institutions.
The loan fraud scandal, the biggest in Japanese banking history, arose when
Ms Nui Onoue, an Osaka restaurant owner, allegedly borrowed Y250bn from a
range of financial institutions using forged deposit certificates from the
Toyo Shinkin.
The Industrial Bank of Japan, one of Japan's most prestigious banks, was
also severely embarrassed by the affair, as its own loans to Ms Onoue had
helped increase her credibility in the eyes of the financial community. She
was also at one point the largest individual shareholder in the IBJ.
The borrowed money is believed to have been used to cover losses in the
stock market.
Under the scheme, details of which were still emerging last night, 25 of
Toyo Shinkin's 30 branches are to be sold to credit co-operatives in the
area, with the balance of the business to be taken over by the Sanwa Bank.
Both the IBJ and the Fuji Bank will write off 70 per cent of the billions of
yen of loans issued to the Toyo Shinkin, and the IBJ has agreed to extend
credit to the remainder of the business to help it get back on its feet
again.
Money from Japan's deposit insurance scheme is also being used to support
the deal.
A total of Y130bn in loans owed by the Toyo Shinkin are to be written off,
including money owed to non-bank institutions that accepted fraudulent Toyo
Shinkin paper.
The papers were allegedly signed by an officer of the bank without
authorisation, and the Toyo Shinkin has been held responsible for them.

FT  29 APR 92 / International Company News: Taiwan may invest in McDonnell
Douglas
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REUTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TAIWAN'S government is inclined to support a proposed deal for a Taiwanese
company to buy a stake in the commercial aircraft business of McDonnell
Douglas, according to a report by Economics Minister Mr Vincent Siew, Reuter
reports.
The government would be willing to consider providing low-interest loans and
tax breaks to the Dollars 2bn project if Taiwan Aerospace decides to go
ahead with the investment, the report says.
It stops short of explicitly recommending the company proceed with the deal
with the US group, but says the project provides great opportunities for
Taiwan.
'It is a high-risk venture but it will help upgrade our industrial level . .
. We need the full support of parliament, the government and the private
sector.'
The report is due to be delivered to parliament on Wednesday, but was leaked
to the local press.
Taiwan Aerospace, set up last year and 29 per cent owned by the government,
signed a memorandum of understanding with McDonnell Douglas last November to
buy up to 40 per cent of the US company's commercial aircraft operations for
Dollars 2bn.
Taiwan Aerospace has since indicated that the stake acquired could be as low
as 25 per cent.
McDonnell Douglas will retain a 51 per cent stake, but the US company is
already discussing, with other investors from south-east Asia or South
Korea, making up any shortfall in Taiwan's investment.
The deal, which needs approval by both governments, would boost Taiwan's
fledgling aerospace industry and give McDonnell Douglas the funds to develop
its next-generation MD-12 jetliner.
But the deal has run into opposition from some legislators in Taiwan, who
have criticised it as a bad investment and threatened to try to prevent the
government from using state funds to support the project.
Mr Siew's report to parliament says Taiwan's government and private
companies holding stakes in Taiwan Aerospace should reopen negotiations with
McDonnell Douglas to reach agreement on details and conditions of the
proposed investment.
The report, which quotes a three-month feasibility study into the project
completed recently by state-run China Steel Corp, says producing fuselages,
wings and other components for the MD-12 in Taiwan would create 90,000 jobs.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Cairo-based Arab International Bank, part-owned by Libya, has moved to
reassure clients their deposits are secure after Dollars 60m was withdrawn
since mid-April in a mini-run on the bank.
Dr Mustapha Khalil, chairman of AIB and a former prime minister of Egypt,
said yesterday a press campaign quoting assurances from the US government
that the bank was not on the list of banned Libyan institutions was one of
several steps taken to calm depositors' fears.
The assurance, issued by the US Cairo embassy, stated that AIB, whose
deposits amount to Dollars 2.5bn, was not 'considered to be a government of
Libya-controlled entity' and 'US persons are under no restrictions from
engaging in transactions with this bank'.
Dr Khalil described the withdrawal of deposits as 'not very acute,' but was
anxious to reassure the bank's clients their funds were 'in no danger
whatsoever. We are very liquid. We do not deposit money in Libya,' he
declared. Withdrawals accelerated after the UN imposed sanctions against
Libya on April 15, following Tripoli's refusal to yield nationals accused of
the 1988 and 1989 bombings of US and French aircraft.
Libya and Egypt each hold a 28.76 per cent share of the bank which was
established under a special law in 1974 as a banking 'shop window' after
late President Anwar Sadat instituted his new 'open door' policy to business
with the west.
Bankers say Egyptians have been made extremely nervous by the collapse in
recent years of Islamic investments houses which mushroomed in the 1980s.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CRA, the Australian resources group, said yesterday that better than
expected metal prices and favourable foreign exchange rates lifted net
profit above company forecasts to just under ADollars 100m (USDollars 76.9m)
in the first quarter to the end of March.
Mr John Uhrig, chairman, told the annual meeting CRA was forecasting
full-year profits at about the same level as last year, when the group made
a net profit of ADollars 350m, down 26 per cent on the previous year.
Mr Uhrig said the outlook for the year was uncertain. 'Nobody knows how long
increased metal supplies from Russia will continue to depress metal prices,'
he said.
He said it was also unclear what the implications of a forecast contraction
in Japanese economic growth would be for CRA's iron ore, coal and aluminium
businesses.
However, Mr John Ralph, chief executive, said profits were above forecasts
for the first four months and that the board might have have been 'a bit
conservative' in forecasting prices.
Mr Ralph said CRA had predicted an average Australian dollar value of 77 US
cents, compared with the current level of about 75.5 cents. He said the
lower rate would translate into an extra ADollars 25m in net profits if it
were maintained over the rest of the year.
Poseidon Gold (PosGold), part of Mr Robert Champion de Crespigny's Normandy
Poseidon group, reported a 13 per cent improvement in net profits to
ADollars 21.7m for the nine months to the end of March.
The improvement was achieved in spite of lower gold prices and a first-time
tax charge of Dollars 30m following the introduction of corporate taxation
on gold mining.
PosGold said the result did not include ACM Gold, which was acquired
following a joint takeover with Western Mining Corporation of Australian
Consolidated Minerals.

SHARPLY higher film and consumer products earnings helped boost
second-quarter net profits by 29 per cent to Dollars 164m at Walt Disney,
the movie and theme parks group.
The company's revenues in the fiscal quarter to end-March were 15 per cent
higher at Dollars 1.66bn, while earnings per share stood at 31 cents,
against 24 cents a year before.
Mr Michael Eisner, chairman, said earnings were helped by the strength of
animated film and television products and related character merchandise. The
record US box office proceeds of Beauty and the Beast, the animated feature,
were especially helpful in the three-month period.
Operating income for the film division jumped by 85 per cent to Dollars
85.4m in the quarter, on revenues up by 5 per cent to Dollars 641m. The
consumer products division achieved a 33 per cent rise in operating income,
to Dollars 73.1m. Revenues were 55 per cent higher at Dollars 240m.
The theme parks and resorts division improved from its depressed level of a
year ago, at the height of the Gulf war. Operating profits were Dollars
139.1m, up by 6 per cent. Revenues increased by 15 per cent to Dollars
774.1m.

FLETCHER Challenge Canada, which is 72 per cent owned by New Zealand's

(USDollars 210.1m) rights issue.
The Vancouver-based forestry group said it would issue 16.8m common shares

announcement. FCC expects the issue to be completed by May 21.
The New Zealand parent will buy sufficient shares to maintain the current
level of its shareholding in FCC, leaving 4.8m shares for the public.
FCC has a debt load of CDollars 626m, equal to about 40 per cent of total
capital. The company said it was keen to reduce its debt-equity ratio, but
had no expansion plans.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BOEING has posted a 43 per cent increase in first-quarter net earnings to
Dollars 441m from Dollars 309m in the same period last year.
Sales in the first quarter totalled Dollars 7.97bn, compared with Dollars
6.1bn in the first quarter of 1991. Earnings per share were Dollars 1.29,
against 90 cents. Return on sales was 5.5 per cent, slightly higher than
last year's 5.1 per cent.
The solid first-quarter performance reflected higher commercial aircraft
deliveries and a profit from company's defence and space business, which
lost money in the first quarter of last year.
Mr Frank Shrontz, chairman, said he expected sales and earnings in the
second half to be lower than the first half because of fewer deliveries of
747 jumbo aircraft and reduced production of 737 narrow-body aircraft from
21 to 14 a month in the second half.
He told the company's annual shareholders meeting that group sales this year
were expected to be slightly higher at Dollars 29.5bn compared with Dollars
29.3bn last year.
Although Boeing faces a difficult short-term industry environment as a
result of the financial problems of many airlines, it continues to have a
strong backlog of orders, totalling Dollars 95.8bn at the end of last month.
Orders in the first quarter totalled 124 aircraft compared with 91 last
year. Demand for narrow-body aircraft with less than 150 seats was sluggish
but demand for wide bodies remained buoyant.
The company expects to see a gradual recovey in civil aviation this year but
no significant recovery in new orders until later next year. To adapt to the
current weak market conditions, Boeing plans to reduce its 104,000-strong
workforce in the Seattle area this year by about 8,000.
The company is also facing heavy research and development expenditure
largely to finance the development of its new 777 wide-body aircraft and
other commercial aircraft projects. Spending was expected to peak this year
at about Dollars 1.8m and then continue in the Dollars 1.4bn to Dollars
1.6bn range for several more years.
The company is already studying the possible development of a very large
aircraft seating 600 to 800 passengers. This could involve a stretched
version of the 747 or a completely new aircraft.
McDonnell Douglas, Boeing's US competitor, is expected to unveil soon
details of its plan to develop a 400 to 600-seat, four-engined jumbo
aircraft to challenge Boeing's dominance in the very large airliner market.
The European Airbus consortium has similar plans.

FFr275m
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SCHNEIDER, the French electrical power and engineering group, yesterday
reported a collapse in annual profits and announced it would buy out the
minority shareholders in its Merlin Gerin subsidiary.
Net attributable profits plunged to FFr275m (Dollars 49.37m) last year, from
FFr923.9 in 1990, weighed down by losses at Spie Batignolles, its
construction subsidiary. A profits fall had been expected since Spie
Batignolles warned in February that 1991 losses may reach FFr950m. Following
that, Mr Georges de Buffevent, chairman, resigned.
However, Schneider's profits decline was slightly more than analysts had
forecast.
They include the first year's contribution from Square D, the US electrical
equipment group which Schneider bought in a rare hostile takeover last year.
Schneider, which owns 61.3 per cent of Merlin Gerin, a producer of
electrical distribution equipment, is offering its shareholders four
Schneider own shares for five Merlin Gerin shares.
The acquisition had long been expected and makes Schneider the latest of
several leading French companies to buy out minority stakes in subsidiaries,
to simplify their structures and fortify their capital bases.
Recent examples include Havas, the media, marketing and travel combine,
which early this month bought out the remaining shares in Comareg, a
publisher of free newspapers.
Last year, Alcatel Alsthom, the engineering and telecommunications group,
absorbed three subsidiaries.

RHONE-POULENC, the French chemicals producer, yesterday beat its US and
European competitors to win majority control of Chemlon, the Czechoslovakian
state-owned group which is central Europe's largest maker of artificial
fibres.
Mr Jean-Marc Bruel, Rhone-Poulenc's director general, signed a letter of
intent with Chemlon and Mr Jan Holcik, the Slovak industry minister, to form
a jont venture. It will be 52 per cent controlled by the French state-owned
company, rising rapidly to 63 per cent.
The deal followed a year's negotiations against many other leading western
producers, Rhone-Poulenc said.
No price has been given, but Rhone-Poulenc plans to invest FFr500m (Dollars
89.76m) over several years to improve the competitiveness of its FFr750m
turnover partner. Rhone-Poulenc's fibres and polymers division made sales of
FFr13.5bn last year.
This is Rhone-Poulenc's largest investment in central Europe and the largest
French investment in Czechoslovakia since BSN, the food and drinks group,
teamed up 12 months ago with Nestle, the Swiss multinational, to take
control of Cokoladovny, Czechoslovakia's largest food company.
The joint venture will own Chemlon's plant in Humenne, Slovakia, which makes
61,000 tonnes per year of polyamid yarn, used for textiles, carpets and
industrial fibres.
The deal will reinforce Rhone-Poulenc's position in polyamid yarns and give
it an industrial base to develop its business across central Europe, said
the group.
Its other investments in the region include a fibre transformation plant in
eastern Germany, two plants in Hungary and two in Poland, making animal
feeds, health products and agrochemicals.
The final accord for Chemlon should be signed in the next few weeks, said
Rhone-Poulenc.

ARBED, the Luxembourg -based steel group, yesterday announced a sharp drop
in net profits to LFr6bn (Dollars 175m) last year, the halving of its
dividend to LFr100, and the prospect of worse to come.
Confirming the cyclical nature of the steel business, Arbed said the drop in
its net profit, after three good years including a 1990 profit of LFr9.8bn,
was due to falling prices, under the pressure of imports, particularly from
eastern Europe. The group said that finished steel prices had fallen, even
in current francs, below the level of 1984.
At the turn of this year, the European Community removed its quotas on steel
imports, which under newly negotiated association agreements with central
Europe can enter freely from Poland, Czechoslovakia and Hungary. At the same
time, Gatt talks on a Multilateral Steel Agreement and a subsidies code were
stalled.
At current levels, prices were too low to make a profit on the majority of
its steel products, Arbed said. As a result, turnover fell 5 per cent to
LFr198bn. Its total steel production last year stayed steady, decreasing by
only 0.7 per cent from 1990 levels. With higher sales of wire products in
Brazil, Arbed was able to compensate slightly for static or falling output
in Europe.
The group invested a record LFr18.3bn, an increase of 67 per cent over 1990
levels.

<TEXT>
WAGONS-LITS, the Franco-Belgian travel group which last year became the butt
of a controversial bid by Accor of France, trebled its net profits to
BFr1.83bn in 1991,from BFr526m (Dollars 15.3m) in 1990.
Mr Jean-Marc Simon, chairman, said that the increase in profits was due to a
rise in extraordinary earnings. The group, which had an exceptional debit of
BFr493m in 1990, made an exceptional credit of BFr1.49bn last year mainly
from its French property interests.
Wagons-Lits was affected by the disruption caused by the Gulf war last year.
The economic slowdown in Europe and the impact of the US recession on
tourism also affected the result.
However, the group's operating profits rose by 23 per cent during the year,
according to Mr Simon, on turnover which increased by 8.8 per cent to
BFr91.03bn from BFr83.67bn. He said that the performance of the restaurant
and travel agency divisions had improved and the losses from Europcar had
been reduced.
Mr Simon forecast that Europcar would return to profit during the course of
1992. This forms part of Wagons-Lits' plan to double its profitability over
the next three years and to produce annual profits of BFr3bn.

FT  29 APR 92 / International Company News: Further talks over future of
Colonia

<TEXT>
UNION des Assurances de Paris (UAP), the leading player in the French
insurance industry, may be approaching the end of its protracted
negotiations over the future of Colonia, the German insurer controlled by
Victoire.
Mr Gerard Worms, president of Suez, the French financial and industrial
group which has a majority stake in Victoire, said yesterday that his group
was orchestrating discussions between UAP, Victoire and Colonia to 'find a
solution to this delicate problem'.
He suggested the likeliest outcome would be for Victoire, which owns 78 per
cent of Colonia, to cede half its shares in the German company to UAP so
that they both held 50 per cent of the business.

<TEXT>
ITALGAS, the fast-growing Italian gas and water distribution company, raised
net group profits by 16.7 per cent to L91bn (Dollars 73.6m) last year thanks
partly to a 25 per cent increase in sales to L3,353bn.
The improvement has prompted the group, which is controlled by the
state-owned ENI energy and chemicals concern, to raise the dividend by L10 a
share to L100.
Italgas attributed the rise in turnover to an increase in its number of
customers, higher average gas usage and the effect of a cold winter.
Net group interest charges fell by 24 per cent to L51bn from L67bn in 1990
thanks to improved liquidity management and lower-cost sources of finance.
Investment, largely financed by low-cost loans from the European Investment
Bank, rose by 8.2 per cent to L683bn.
Italgas affirmed its commitment to growth, notably outside Italy.
Nordica Sportsystem, the acquisitive sports equipment group controlled by
the Benetton family, raised consolidated sales by 67 per cent to L465bn last
year.

<TEXT>
ERIDANIA, the agro-industrial subsidiary of Italy's Ferruzzi group, raised
net group profits by 28.4 per cent to L172bn (Dollars 137.3m) last year,
while sales increased by 10.2 per cent to L10,096bn.
The improved earnings have spurred a L10 increase in the dividend to L250 a
share for ordinary shares and L280 for savings stock.
The company said its planned merger with Beghin-Say, the French sugar and
foods group that it controls, was advancing steadily. Approval is expected
at Beghin-Say's annual meeting on May 27 and the merger should go ahead at
the beginning of next year.
Eridania forecast that sales and earnings looked set to improve further this
year, partly on account of the planned merger and also due to recent
acquisitions. Moreover, the group's debt-equity ratio was set to fall, in
spite of the acquisitions.

FT  29 APR 92 / International Company News: Hoechst declines 26% to DM605m
in first quarter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
HOECHST yesterday continued the tale of woe from the German chemical
companies with the announcement of a 26 per cent decline in pre-tax profits
to DM605m (Dollars 367m) in the first quarter of 1992.
Nor did the company hold out much hope of an early improvement. Hoechst said
it hoped for a more favourable trend in operating profits in the course of
this year although no significant revival in business had been seen so far
in the second quarter.
The first-quarter profit represented a decreased yield on turnover of 5.3
per cent against 7.3 per cent in the same period of last year. In the whole
of 1991, pre-tax profits dropped by 20 per cent to DM2.6bn, with turnover 5
per cent higher at DM47bn. The company cut its dividend by DM1 to DM12.
Hoechst said that demand had picked up considerably in the first three
months compared with last year's fourth quarter, but was still weaker than
the normal seasonal level. There were few signs of any economic upturn
either in western Europe or the US, with growth slowing down in Germany and
Japan.
Group turnover in the quarter was 2 per cent higher at DM11.5bn. Volume
sales were 2 per cent higher, but prices fell at the same rate under the
weight of heavy competition. The higher value of the dollar and yen against
the D-Mark accounted for the slight turnover advance. In Germany, turnover
was up by 2 per cent; business in industrial chemicals was weak, with the
increase coming from higher sales of pharmaceutical products.
Hoechst's comments about the slackness of foreign markets were in line with
those of Siemens, the German electrical and electronics group, which this
week reported an 8 per cent rise in first-half net profits, mainly due to
domestic growth. Siemens reported flat foreign business and benefited from
orders linked to economic reconstruction in east Germany. Chemical companies
have little involvement with east Germany's infrastructural rebuilding.
Hoechst said that its exports were weaker, although sales of dyes to the US
and pharmaceuticals to Asia were higher. EC business was stagnant. The 12
per cent turnover rise in the US was due to the first-time inclusion of
Great Lakes Carbon, the US graphite subsidiary, and the firmer dollar.
Business in South America was favourable, except for Brazil.

FT  29 APR 92 / International Company News: Tenneco income advances to
Dollars 33m
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TENNECO, the US conglomerate in the throes of a restructuring, yesterday
reported a Dollars 32m improvement in first-quarter net income. It also
announced the loss of 2,250 jobs in Europe with the closure of three plants
run by its troubled Case equipment subsidiary.
The Houston-based company reported net income of Dollars 33m, or 20 cents a
share, compared with Dollars 1m or a loss of 3 cents per share last year on
revenues flat at Dollars 3.3bn. Operating income rose from Dollars 113m to
Dollars 215m. The figures were a little ahead of most analysts' forecasts,
but the shares dipped Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 43 1/2 .
Mr Michael Walsh, the new president and chief executive, is pushing through
a plan to restore the company to what he calls 'respectable levels of
profitability' and sharply cut the debt on its balance sheet.
The results included improved operating performances by all Tenneco's
divisions, although Case, which makes agricultural and construction
equipment, still lost Dollars 77m. That figure compares with a loss of
Dollars 147m a year ago, when the subsidiary took a Dollars 32m charge for
job cuts.
Case, which has been hit by a downturn in its markets and excessive
inventory levels, announced as part of its restructuring the closure of its
plants in Carvin, France and Zaragoza, Spain.
It would no longer manufacture high capacity excavators made at Carvin and
would source its wheel loaders and hydraulic cylinders made at Zaragoza.
It said it had also sold selected assets of its Vibromax compaction
equipment business and would close its plant in Dusseldorf, Germany, later
this year.
These actions, which will reduce its European plants from 12 to nine, form
part of a previously announced two-year plan to cut Case's employment from
30,000 people at the end of 1990 to about 20,000 at the end of this year.
Mr Walsh said Case had met its performance targets for the quarter but
refused to be drawn on when it might return to profit or whether he might
sell the business.
Operating expenses were significantly lower, while the subsidiary's
worldwide production dropped 25 per cent from a year ago and dealer
inventories fell Dollars 900m.

FT  29 APR 92 / UK Company News: Yule Catto rises to Pounds 21.8m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
YULE CATTO, the ind-ustrial chemicals and building products group, lifted
pre-tax profits from Pounds 20.5m to Pounds 21.8m in 1991 in spite of 'the
continuing recession which affected many of the markets served by group
companies'.
Turnover advanced to Pounds 265m (Pounds 254m).
Lord Catto, chairman, said the speciality chemicals division contributed
record profits through the realisation of marketing and organisational
strategies developed in earlier years.
Many of the building product companies 'fared surprisingly well' given the
present trading conditions.
The group was fortunate in having a wide spread of business within the
European Community, Lord Catto said, with a number of companies still
experiencing reasonable if slower growth in their domestic markets.
He was confident that the division had contained the deterioration in order
books and that current activity levels were satisfactory.
On current trading, operating results were ahead both of internal targets
and the corresponding period of 1991.
After tax of Pounds 6.55m (Pounds 6.71m) and minorities, earnings per share
amounted to 16.1p against 14.2p. The proposed final dividend is lifted to
3.1p for a total of 5.4p (4.7p).
There was an extraordinary credit of Pounds 4.25m (Pounds 938,000 debit)
resulting from the sale of the Malaysian plantations in January 1991.
Net borrowings at the year end were reduced to Pounds 11.5m compared with a
high of Pounds 35.2m at the end of 1990 because of the acquisitions made in
that year.
During 1991 the sale of the plantations realised Pounds 16.5m in total while
continuing operations contributed net cash of Pounds 7.2m.

Sennah Rubber, an investment company with holdings in tropical plantations
and financial services companies, reported profits of Pounds 824,879 pre-tax
for 1991.
The increase from the previous year's Pounds 767,352 came despite lower
gross income of Pounds 970,467 (Pounds 1.05m) and reflected a turnround to
profits on currency exchange.
Earnings per share worked through at 1.2p (1.09p) and the single
distribution for the year is held at 0.5p.

United Biscuits has established a presence in the Italian confectionery
business by acquiring 74 per cent of Aura, a privately-owned manufacturer of
chocolate and praline confectionery, for an undisclosed cash sum.
Aura, which will operate as part of Terry's, UB's confectionery subsidiary,

factory near Genoa with 150 employees.
UB plans to distribute some of its existing confectionery range through Aura

FT  29 APR 92 / UK Company News: Folkes shows sharp fall to Pounds 2.5m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
FOLKES GROUP, the West Midlands-based property, engineering and building
products concern, suffered a 38 per cent fall in 1991 pre-tax profits from
Pounds 4.03m to Pounds 2.5m.
Mr Constantine Folkes, chairman and chief executive, said that the company
had yet to see signs of recovery. With uncertainty and a lack of confidence
in industry, it was difficult to predict the outcome for the current year.
Operating profit fell to Pounds 2.54m (Pounds 3.07m) and there was a
turnround from interest received of Pounds 919,000 to payments of Pounds
60,000.
Mr Folkes said that the property division performed well, helped by develop-
ment projects coming on stream and enhanced rent revisions.
The engineering side was satisfactory but fortunes of the building products
businesses were dominated by the progress of the housing market.
Group turnover was Pounds 43.2m (Pounds 47.7m) and earnings per share came
out at 4.93p (7.49p). An increased final dividend of 1.8p is proposed for a
total of 2.375p (2.3p).

<TEXT>
EDINBURGH Investment Trust yesterday announced a 5.1 per cent increase in
its final dividend to 5.2p, despite a 3.8 per cent fall in net assets per
share over the year to March 31.
Mr Ian Massie, fund manager, said the trust's long term policy was to
increase dividends faster than inflation. He was confident about the outlook
for the economy. Portfolio performance lagged behind the FT-A All-Share
index, which fell 1.8 per cent during the year. Mr Massie said the cyclical
sectors in which the trust had invested had shown an improved performance
since the general election.
At the end of March, the geographical split of assets was as follows: UK
(61.2 per cent); North America (10.7 per cent); Europe (13.9 per cent);
Japan (9.4 per cent); other Far East (5.4 per cent).
Net assets per share at end-March were Pounds 745.8m, equivalent to 253.8p
per share, against an adjusted 263.8p at end-March 1991. The final dividend
increases the total to 8.05p (7.7p), payable from earnings of 8.19p (8.17p)
per share.

FT  29 APR 92 / UK Company News: SmithKline Beecham expands in Germany
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY ROBINSON, East Europe Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SMITHKLINE Beecham has bought a former East German vaccine company from
Treuhandanstalt, the German privatisation agency, in a move which takes the
UK-based pharmaceutical group into the manufacture of influenza vaccines for
the first time and strengthens its position in central Europe.
The purchase of Sachsisches Serumwerke (SSW) by SmithKline Beecham
Biologicals gives it control over the largest producer of influenza vaccines
in Germany with 1991 sales of about Dm30m (Pounds 10.2m).
It takes over a workforce of 200 at the company's Dresden factory and has
guaranteed to invest about Dm10m over the next five years to develop the
site into a manufacturing site with full European regulatory approvals.
Robert Fleming, the merchant bank which advised Treuhandanstalt on the sale,
said the acquisition marked the first foreign purchase of an East German
pharmaceutical company.
Only some 350 of the more than 5,000 former East German companies privatised
by Treuhand have been sold to foreign concerns.
In this case the UK-based company outbid Behring Werke, a subsidiary of
Hoechst of Germany, and Ivax, an associate of the North American Vaccine
Company.
Purchase of the German company offered SB both a new product line and
manufacturing and marketing access to the German and central European
markets.
Mr Jan Leschly, chairman of Worldwide Pharmaceuticals at SB said 'SmithKline
Beecham Biologicals is one of the few worldwide vaccine producers which has
no existing flu manufacturing facilities.
'This investment in SSW therefore represents excellent commercial logic and
an important addition to our portfolio of vaccine products in Europe.'

FT  29 APR 92 / UK Company News: Strathmore purchase ends search by Matthew
Clark
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP RAWSTORNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MATTHEW CLARK, maker of Stone's ginger wine and Old England British sherry,
is to buy Strathmore, Scotland's leading bottled water brand, for Pounds
11m.
The consideration will be paid in cash but, subject to shareholders'
consent, Joseph Dunn (Bottlers), Strathmore's parent company, will subscribe
for Pounds 3m of Matthew Clark ordinary shares, giving it a 7.4 per cent
stake.
The acquisition ends a two-year search by Matthew Clark for a bottled water
or cider brand to strengthen its drinks portfolio.
The group has focused its strategy on developing as a producer and
distributor of drinks in the UK market after a substantial restructuring.
Mr Peter Aikens, chief executive, said yesterday: 'Strathmore fits well into
our plans. It is a strong brand in a high growth sector; and its potential
for rapid growth will complement our existing mature and cash generative
brands.'
The bottled water market in Britain has been one of the fastest growing
drinks sectors. Between 1984 and 1990, sales volumes rose from 80m litres to
400m litres, and the value of retail sales increased from Pounds 52m to
Pounds 330m. Annual consumption per person in the UK is still far lower than
in continental Europe: 8 litres a year compared with 70 litres in France,
Germany and Italy.
Strathmore, based at Forfar, made pre-tax profits of Pounds 452,000 last
year on turnover of Pounds 4.3m.
The water, extracted from a natural spring, is sold in sparkling, still, and
citrus flavoured versions. It has gained a 25 per cent share of the bottled
water market in the Scottish grocery sector during the past six years, but
has only recently been listed by several multiple grocers south of the
border.
Joseph Dunn, one of Scotland's leading beer and soft drinks wholesalers,
will continue to distribute Strathmore in Scotland and has agreed reciprocal
distribution deals on other drinks brands with Matthew Clark.
The acquisition is expected to lead to a small dilution in Matthew Clark's
earnings per share this year, but to make a positive contribution in
1993-94.

FT  29 APR 92 / UK Company News: TSW declines to Pounds 1.95m after heavy
reorganisation costs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TSW-TELEVISION South West Holdings, the ITV company which has lost its
franchise, yesterday announced a sharp drop in pre-tax profits to Pounds
1.95m for the 17 months to December 31.
The figure compared with Pounds 4.7m profit in the 12 months to July 31
1990.
The outcome was struck after Exchequer levy of Pounds 2.55m and exceptional
items of Pounds 2.54m mainly resulting from a reorganisation of the company.
TSW also had an extraordinary charge of Pounds 4.15m - being the expense of
the original franchise bid, the cost of the judicial review of the
Independent Television Commission's decision not to give TSW a licence and
the associated closure costs.
As well as planning the phased reduction of staff TSW said yesterday it was
considering all the options open to it following the loss of its
broadcasting licence.
One option is to realise its assets and distribute the cash to shareholders.
'Others are being explored in considerable depth with the objective of
enhancing shareholder value,' TSW said.
Sir Brian Bailey, chairman, said he thought the results were 'very
creditable' against the background of economic recession and poor
advertising revenue.
The company would continue to provide viewers with the standard of service
to which they are entitled until the end of the franchise period at the end
of this year.
Turnover was Pounds 59.5m compared with Pounds 44m for the previous 12
months. Earnings per share were 5p (12.6p) and following the payment of two
interim dividends amounting to 4p a final dividend of 3p is recommended
making a total of 7p (5p).
TSW also said that it saw no need to make provision against the overall net
book value of the assets at the balance sheet date when the company had net
cash of Pounds 3.44m.
The shares closed unchanged at 52p.

LLOYDS Chemists, which recently took control of rival Macarthy via a Pounds
92.5m bid, has made a Pounds 6.2m share offer for Ayrshire Pharmaceuticals.
Ayrshire operates 14 chemist shops, two drugstores and a pharmaceutical
wholesaling business in Scotland.
The offer involves Lloyds issuing 1.72m new shares, 1.5 per cent of the
present total. Lloyds shares fell 5p to 360p.
Holders of 51.3 per cent of Ayrshire's ordinary shares have given
irrevocable undertakings to accept.
Lloyds said it planned to use Ayrshire's 28,000 sq ft warehouse and office
in Kilmarnock as the nucleus for its distribution and wholesaling activities
in Scotland. The acquisition of Macarthy brought Lloyds the Savory &amp; Moore
chain which has shops in Scotland.

   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PLASTISEAL, which manufactures windows and doors, mainly for the public
sector, dipped sharply into the red last year following poor sales in the
second half.
The USM-traded company incurred a pre-tax deficit of Pounds 780,000 for the
12 months to January 31, struck after exceptional charges of Pounds 269,000
(Pounds 520,000), as profits of Pounds 496,000 on property disposals were
offset by closure and re-organisation costs of Pounds 765,000.
Properties worth a further Pounds 700,000 are being held for resale.
The outcome compared with profits of Pounds 310,000 last time and Pounds
438,000 at the interim stage. Turnover fell to Pounds 13.7m (Pounds 18m).
There was an operating loss of Pounds 147,000 (Pounds 1.15m profit).
Mr Anthony Marson, who took over as chairman this month, said that the
company was affected by lower local authority and Property Services Agency
spending.
However, he said that there has been a slight improvement since the election
and that the company is expected to return to profit this year.
Interest charges increased to Pounds 364,000 (Pounds 320,000) on net
borrowings of about Pounds 3.5m.
Year-end gearing went above 100 per cent, due to seasonal factors, but it
has since been reduced.
Mr Michael Price, one of the two former joint chairmen, has resigned. The
other, Mr Howard Manttan, becomes managing director.
The Nuneaton head office is being closed down while uPVC window
manufacturing has been transferred from Bury to Coventry.
Losses per share emerged at 6.2p (earnings 2.4p) and the final dividend is
passed, leaving a total of 1.5p.

FT  29 APR 92 / UK Company News: Acquisition costs put Borland in loss
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   SAN FRANCISCO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BORLAND International, the California-based personal computer software
publisher, reported a loss for its fourth quarter following additional
charges in connection with its acquisition of Ashton-Tate, a database
management software company.
Revenues for the fourth quarter ending March 31 were 14 per cent down at
Dollars 117m (Pounds 66.1m) compared with Dollars 136m. The pre-tax and net
loss was Dollars 26.9m against a pre-tax income of Dollars 6.92m last time
and after-tax income of Dollars 2.77m. Losses per share were Dollars 1.05
(11 cents earnings).
Included in the results was a Dollars 30m charge to cover severance and
facilities costs arising from the consolidation of international operations
following the Ashton-Tate acquisition.
This latest restructuring charge brings the total of pre-tax transactions
and restructuring costs related to the acquisition to Dollars 146m. Borland
acquired Ashton-Tate last year, in a deal valued at Dollars 439m.
Borland's stock price closed down Dollars 2 at Dollars 46.75 in New York on
Monday amid concerns that its results would be below expectations. The
results were announced after the close.
Revenues for the year to March totalled Dollars 483m, (Dollars 457m). The
pre-tax loss was Dollars 125m (Dollars 17.9m profit) and net losses for the
year amounted to Dollars 110m, or Dollars 4.29 per share, compared with net
income of Dollars 4.8m, or 20 cents per share.
'Fiscal 1992 was a pivotal year in Borland's history,' said Mr Philippe
Kahn, chairman, president and chief executive. 'In addition to launching
significant new products, we laid the foundation for the future with the
acquisition of Ashton-Tate. Fiscal 1993 should see us continue our momentum
with the release of a new generation of graphical products for a variety of
operating systems.'
Borland's UK share price, currently languishing at Pounds 26.25, down 25p on
the day, has been one of the wonders of London's unlisted securities market.
It was the market's best performing stock in 1990, more than doubling over
the year to touch Pounds 15.10. It continued its spectacular rise last year
reaching a high of Pounds 45.75. For UK investors, however, the price is
largely academic because over 90 per cent of Borland's shares are now traded
on the over-the-counter market in the US.
Its London quote is an anomaly, the result of an early decision by Mr Kahn,
the company's French-born founder, to go public in Europe where he had
connections with investment bankers.
Borland was a pioneer of low-priced computer software sold by, at that time,
unconventional methods such as mail order. But despite the often meteoric
growth of the company's share price, it has an erratic business record and
is moving into an area where it will face direct competition from Microsoft,
a leading personal computer software company.

FT  29 APR 92 / UK Company News: Wenham to become LBC Radio chairman
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LBC RADIO, the London commercial station is to appoint Mr Brian Wenham,
former managing director of BBC Radio, as its chairman.
Mr Wenham will not only reconstruct the radio company's board but will also
lead its bid to retain its franchise, which will be advertised next March.
the decision follows the resignation of Mr Christopher Chataway as LBC
chairman. Mr Chataway remains chairman of Crown Communications, LBC's parent
group.
The speech-based service will face stiff competition for the renewal of its
licence.
Applicants will almost certainly include a consortium put together by Mr
Douglas Moffitt, LBC's financial editor for 17 years, who refused to sign a
new contract last year.
Mr Moffitt has been talking to Sir David Nicholas, former chairman of
Independent Television News, about the possibility of leading the franchise
application.
Mr Brian Hayes was another high profile departure from LBC. He resigned in
1990 after Mr Charlie Cox, the general manager, decided to reschedule for
later in the day the morning phone-in programme which Mr Hayes had run for
14 years.
LBC has been affected by redundancies, losses at Crown, and what has been
seen as the abrasive style of its Australian management.
In the year to September 1991, Crown's total deficit came to Pounds 6.79m
compared to pre-tax profits of Pounds 611,000 previously.
RFM, the company's French radio subsidiary incurred losses of nearly Pounds
3m.
The appointment of Mr Wenham, chairman of Crown's small television
subsidiary, represents an attempt to strengthen the board in what may be a
fight for survival.
LBC has already been increasing its audience share, according to industry
research.

FT  29 APR 92 / UK Company News: Teams on both sides line up - The Battle
for Midland
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON HOLBERTON and RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BATTLE LINES began to take shape yesterday as the phony war over Midland
Bank at last broke out into the open, with the two combatants each weighing
in with advisers who have not previously represented them on a substantial
acquisition.
Hongkong's attack is being led by Mr William ('Willie') Purves, the bank's
chairman since 1986. Mr Purves towers over the Hongkong Bank: nothing of
importance happens without his personal approval. He and Sir Kit McMahon,
former chairman of Midland, conceived the combination at an IMF meeting in
1987.
The Hongkong Bank team is split between London and Hong Kong, though much
more of the day-to-day running of the bid is expected to move to London
should Lloyd's offer clear the regulatory hurdles.
Around Mr Purves are gathered Mr John Grey, executive deputy chairman, and
Mr Chalmers Carr, the bank's legal counsel. In the team is also Mr Simon
Burrows, a financial planner who has been responsible for the bank's
detailed study of Midland.
An all-out battle for control of Midland is also expected to see Mr Bernard
Asher, the London-based Hongkong Bank director who chairs its investment
banking operations of Wardley and James Capel, pitched into the ring.
Hongkong Bank's need for a senior figure in the UK to fight the bid is all
the more pressing given its status as an outsider as far as the UK
establishment is concerned. Mr Purves himself has called on government
officials to make the bank's case, but on a trip to London last week did not
call on Mr Michael Hesseltine, whose decision could be crucial in deciding
whether the rival bids are to be referred.
Schroders, Hongkong's advisers, were called on board by Mr Purves, whose
personal contacts with Mr Win Bischoff, the merchant bank's chairman, date
back to the time when Mr Bischoff himself worked in Hong Kong.
Schroders' team running the bid, led by Mr Derek Netherton and Ms Alison
Carnwath, suffers the disadvantage of dealing with a client based on the
other side of the world - another factor which could see more control of the
bid passing to London if Lloyds proceeds.
Lloyds has also called in new advisers, Baring Brothers, to help with its
bid. It relied on its in-house advisers, Lloyds Merchant Bank, during its
failed bid for Standard Chartered in the mid-1980s and its successful bid
for Abbey Life, the insurance group. Mr David Horne, chairman of LMB, is now
working alongside Mr Andrew Tuckey, chairman of Baring Brothers, and Mr
Charles Irby, a Baring director, on the bid.
As with Hongkong Bank, Lloyds' bid is also directed very much from the
office of its chief executive, Mr Brian Pitman.
Neither side has set up formal war cabinets to fight their corners - though
should the battle escalate into all-out war such a move seems likely.

FT  29 APR 92 / UK Company News: Shareholders express preference - The
Battle for Midland
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS, NORMA COHEN and SIMON HOLBERTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A BIDDING war for Midland between Lloyds Bank and Hongkong Bank would almost
certainly be won by the UK clearer, according to shareholders of the banks
and analysts yesterday.
It also became clear that many Midland shareholders, most of whom are based
in the UK, would prefer a Lloyds offer than one from Hongkong Bank. 'If
there were two solid bids on the table, Lloyds would win hands down,' said
one Scottish fund manager, summing up the attitude of Midland shareholders
around the country.
Lloyds said its projected offer, worth 447p a share last night, could be
justified economically on projections of profits from Midlands' operations,
together with projected annual savings of Pounds 700m within four years from
combining the two businesses.
Its shareholders could expect further potential gains from any increase in
income following a takeover, for instance from selling insurance policies to
Midland customers. Further income could also come from the sale of some
branches, one of the plans to make the takeover more acceptable to the
competition authorities. Both leave more room for Lloyds to increase its
offer if need be.
'Midland is worth considerably more to Lloyds' shareholders than to Hongkong
Bank's,' one Lloyds adviser commented.
However, the extent to which the extra profits would find their way to
Lloyds' shareholders is unclear. 'Those benefits won't just flow to
shareholders,' said Mr Colin Wilks, Lloyds' chief finance officer. Customers
would also benefit from the savings, he added - an argument which is key to
Lloyds' ability to convince the competition authorities to accept its plans.
Yesterday, the bank would provide no further details of expected future
income the merged bank could create, or how much of that would be ploughed
back in investment.
Midland shareholders yesterday expressed a preference both for the price
which Lloyds plans to offer, and for Lloyds as an enlarged group. HKB, some
said, was seeking Midland precisely because it would like to reduce its own
exposure to Hong Kong and move into other markets.
Meanwhile, a higher offer from Hongkong Bank would initially please neither
Hong Kong's stock market nor the Chinese, both of which, for different
reasons, would regard it as a mistake.
China has had a largely positive reaction so far to Hongkong Bank's move on
Midland. But underlying its comments has been the view that the bank is
paying enough by offering 378p a share.
A higher offer from Hongkong Bank, which would almost certainly be in the
form of more equity and not cash, would probably be criticised by mainland
Chinese interest in the colony. It is unclear, however, if such criticism
would be turned into action which could prejudice the bank's operations in
Hong Kong.
The announcement of Lloyds bid had the immediate effect of adding around
HKDollars 2.50 to Hongkong Bank's share price. The strength of its share
price - which closed yesterday at Dollars HK42.75 - has added some Pounds
300m to the theoretical value of its bid. However, it remains Pounds 300m
less than the putative Lloyds offer.

FT  29 APR 92 / Bibby bids Pounds 75m for Caterpillar in Spain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
J BIBBY &amp; Sons, the industrial and agricultural conglomerate which is 79 per
cent owned by the South African Barlow Rand group, yesterday launched a
hostile Pounds 75m bid for Finanzauto, Spain's only authorised Caterpillar
dealer.
Mr Alan Gresty, Bibby's finance director, said the acquisition would
strengthen the UK group's presence in Spain and Portugal, the European
countries with the most growth potential.
Mr Gresty said he was confident the deal would be acceptable to Finanzauto's
shareholders: 'We are offering a very good price . . . and good multiple of
18.7 times 1991 earnings.'
The Finanzauto board on Monday night rejected the offer of Pta1,300 per
share, a premium of 20.9 per cent over the Spanish company's closing price
last Wednesday.
Trading in Finanzauto was suspended on the Spanish stock market at Pta1,075
a share on Thursday as rumours of a bid inflated the price.
The board says the offer does not conform to the conditions negotiated by
the board with Barlow Rand.
If the offer goes unconditional with more than 51 per cent of acceptances,
Bibby will also acquire Finanzauto's 59 per cent stake in Portugal's only
authorised Caterpillar dealer Stet.
The acquisition will be funded through bank borrowings which, in addition to
Finanzauto's Pounds 117m debt, would force gearing to more than 100 per
cent. Mr Gresty said Bibby aimed to have gearing back below 100 per cent by
the September year-end.
The group said it would reduce debt by selling Finanzauto's peripheral
businesses and perhaps a rights issue. Barlow Rand has indicated it would be
prepared to take up its rights.
Finanzauto reported profits before tax and minority interests of Pta1.4bn
(Pounds 7.6m) on sales of Pta53.2bn for the year to December 31.
Bibby announced the offer in conjunction with interim results which showed a
2 per cent rise in pre-tax profits to Pounds 17m for the 26 weeks to March
28. A reduction in interest charges from Pounds 4m to Pounds 2m, because of
the Pounds 14.6m rights issue last May, and lower base rates in the UK, was
the main reason for the profits rise.
Earnings per share fell from from 9.68p to 9.23p. The dividend was
maintained at 2.85p.

FT  29 APR 92 / Demergers replace the buy-outs: Nikki Tait analyses the rise
of the latest US boardroom favourite
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
No one could claim that merger and acquisition work is booming in the US.
Leveraged buy-outs have ground to a near-halt, and there has been only one
acquisition of more than Dollars 1bn this year. But what about 'demergers'?
Last week, Ralston Purina, the St Louis-based consumer products company with
interests ranging from dry-cell batteries to pet food, announced the
possible spin-off of its baking subsidiary, Continental Baking Company, to
existing shareholders. This is the nation's largest wholesale baker, and the
division's near-Dollars 2bn (Pounds 1.1bn) in annual sales derives from such
standard household fare as Wonder bread and Twinkies cupcakes.
The business was bought for Dollars 475m in 1984, and its likely divestiture
will probably involve a Dollars 600m dividend payment from Continental to
Ralston. That, in turn, has spurred thoughts that the consumer products
group - which has just bought Ever Ready in the UK from Hanson - may be
planning further acquisitions.
Even if the transaction is approved by Ralston's board this month, it will
take months to complete. Nevertheless, Ralston does not seem to be the only
company taking advantage of the demerger concept.
Only a few weeks ago, for example, Dial Corporation, another consumer
products conglomerate, spun off its sizeable financial services division as
an independently quoted company.
And a mere 24 hours before the Ralston news, Union Carbide, the chemicals
group, confirmed that a demerger of its industrial gases business should be
complete by the end of the second quarter.
A few swallows do not make a summer, but figures from Securities Data, which
tracks deal activity generally, confirm - at least, tentatively - that
'demerger' interest is on the rise. In the first quarter of 1992, the firm
calculates that 13 demerger deals were announced. This contrasts sharply
with the six or seven demerger proposals unveiled in each of the five
preceding quarters.
In fact, activity in the first quarter of 1992 represents a return to levels
last seen during the first nine months of 1990. Then, there were 17
demergers announced in the first quarter, 13 in the second and 19 in the
third.
In one sense, the timing of this rise in demerger activity is surprising.
Demergers have often been seen as a defensive reaction to hostile bid
activity or shareholder agitation.
Perhaps the best recent example would be USX, the large steel and energy
group which split these two activities into separately quoted companies - US
Steel and Marathon - under dogged pressure from Mr Carl Icahn, the corporate
raider.
Today, although shareholders' grievances are still being voiced, they are
more likely to come from institutional investors than from buccaneering
bidders with fistfuls of threatening cash. Hostile bids have largely
disappeared.
However, in other respects, the modest rebirth in demergers may be more
explicable. Usually, the aim of the demerger is to rid a diversified group
of a lowly rated subsidiary, and hence improve the stock-market image of the
remaining business. Companies contemplating such a move invariably talk of
'enhancing shareholder value'.
With Wall Street at record levels, and some trade buyers facing financing
problems, divestiture by means of a demerger may begin to look more
attractive than the conventional sale route. Certainly, it spares management
any criticism that a business - which itself may not be in the best of
health - has been undersold during a recessionary credit crunch.
Even so, choosing between a demerger and a trade sale is rarely easy. For
example, Mr John Teets, chairman of Dial, admits that the decision over how
to handle the group's transport manufacturing business - also up for
divestiture - is more finely balanced than the earlier election to demerge
the finance arm.
'A spin-off is much more complicated than a sale,' he notes. 'The business
has to stand alone, on a credit rating which is at least triple-B. It must
have the ability to offer performance bonds on contracts it bids for. And it
must have a cash-flow and earnings record that's going to be recognised on
Wall Street.'
The real test of any demerger, of course, is whether shareholder value is,
indeed, created - and, as no one can ever judge how shares in an
'undemerged' company would have fared, any judgment tends to be subjective.
But the process is certainly not a guaranteed winner.
Mr Icahn's punt on USX, for example, ended with the sale of his 13.3 per
cent stake only eight days after the stock spilt at the equivalent of
Dollars 30 per old USX share. The tycoon had bought the stake up to five
years earlier, at an average price of Dollars 24. His return significantly
underperformed that of the US stockmarket generally.
Still, Mr Icahn may have been wise to get out when he did. Since just before
the stake sale in May 1991, USX-US Steel shares have eased from Dollars 25
3/4 to Dollars 24 3/4 and USX-Marathon shares have fallen from Dollars 26
1/4 to Dollars 21 1/2 . So, in share price terms and even allowing for
recession, the demerger has scarcely been a startling success.
However, if the long-term impact is sometimes debatable, the immediate
reaction may be more positive. Ralston, whose bakery business operates in a
mature market and has suffered profit pressure recently, had the
satisfaction of seeing its shares gain Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 48 1/2 last
week, after the news was announced.

FT  29 APR 92 / TV-am joins bidding for Channel 5: Daily Telegraph group and
Time Warner in deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TV-am, the UK commercial breakfast broadcaster, has joined Time Warner and
Mr Conrad Black's Daily Telegraph group to create a consortium to bid for
Channel 5.
Mr Bruce Gyngell, chairman of TV-am, is to be the chairman of the new
consortium to be called The Entertainment Channel and based at TV-am's
London headquarters.
The new grouping could pose a serious threat to the other declared bidders
for Channel 5 including Mr Silvio Berlusconi's Fininvest and Five TV, the
company backed by Mr Moses Znaimer, founder of City TV in Toronto.
TV-am, which lost its franchise in last year's competitive tenders for new
broadcasting licences, took the decision to be involved in a Channel 5 bid
at a board meeting on Monday night.
Bids for Channel 5 have to be sent to the Independent Television Commission
by July and broadcasting has to begin by the beginning of 1995. The new
channel will be able to cover about three quarters of the UK population. The
ITC has warned it will not award the licence unless a satisfactory solution
is found to the problem of retuning.
The winner has to pay for the retuning of around 3m video recorders which
will suffer interference from the new channel.
'One of the significant things about our consortium is that we have British
Telecom to carry out the retuning,' Mr Gyngell said last night.
BT make 40,000 home visits a day and Mr Gyngell believes trusted,
experienced people will be needed to carry out the work.
Mr Jeremy Fox, an independent producer, is to be chief executive of the
venture and the franchise application will be written by Mr David Keithley,
head of public affairs at TV-am.
The Entertainment Channel would offer a national service but have some local
programming.
The presence of Time Warner, the world's largest media group, and Mr Black,
who has made it clear he wants to increase his interests in television, will
make The Entertainment Channel a very serious bidder.
Applicants must pass a quality threshold - which includes retuning - and in
most circumstances the licence will then go to the highest bidder. The
channel will be run as a publisher-broadcaster - most programmes will be
commissioned rather than made in-house.
Most estimates suggest at least Pounds 200m is needed to successfully launch
Channel 5 against competition from commercial and satellite television.

FT  29 APR 92 / The Lex Column: Borland
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Yesterday's full year results from Borland International, the US software
group, showed why its shares have nearly halved to Pounds 26 in the last
three months. The Dollars 146m cost of integrating the Ashton-Tate
acquisition resulted in a net loss of Dollars 110m for the year. On the face
of it, the Borland fairy tale has ended nastily.
It is thus worth recalling that even now the shares have outperformed the
market more than threefold since the start of 1990. Borland argues that
progress last year was hindered not just by Ashton-Tate but by preparing the
now imminent launch of a new generation of products. It professes confidence
that its bottom line will be restored to health this year. Given that rival
Microsoft recently announced its intention to enter Borland's market for
database software, the going may be tougher thereafter. Investors should
wait to see how the new products fare before taking a view.

FT  29 APR 92 / The Lex Column: US economy
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
While the 2 per cent rise in US output in the first quarter was the sharpest
in three years, it is also a warning against high expectations. Past US
recoveries have kicked off with growth of 6 per cent and more. But in past
recoveries, the US consumer enjoyed lower or even negative rates of real
interest, had higher savings and lower debt in relation to income and was
less worried about job security. US consumer confidence is higher now than
in previous months. But it is still lower than a year ago. The US economy
may not be burdened by Germany's explosion of public spending or Japan's
memory of frantic asset inflation. But until its legacy of debt is worked
off, growth at much more than 2 per cent may be slow in coming.
So why is Wall Street so obstinately cheerful? The optimist would reply that
the restructuring of US industry and the huge extraordinary write-offs of
last year leave room for a rebound in corporate earnings this year of maybe
40 per cent. But that is largely a matter of swings and roundabouts. On a
longer view, it is not quite clear why the Dow should be 10 per cent higher
than at its pre-recession peak in 1990. These earnings expectations had
better not be disappointed.

FT  29 APR 92 / The Lex Column: Merger issues
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The battle for Midland looks the biggest test yet for the EC's still
relatively untried merger rules. Lloyds' intervention, after all, raises the
possibility of two bids for the same target being scrutinised by different
regulators, with all the scope for unwitting prejudice which that might
involve.
When Sir Leon Brittan recently referred the Tarmac/Steetley joint venture
back to London - where it was considered alongside Redland's simultaneous
bid for Steetley - he emphasised that related cases ought to be dealt with
by a single authority. But though that principle may yet prove significant,
the issues this time are much more complicated, and the political and
financial stakes considerably higher. As of last night, the chances of the
Lloyds offer reaching first base appeared to hinge on its efforts, via the
UK government, to persuade Brussels that responsibility for investigating
the Hong Kong bid should also be returned to the UK. The widespread
assumption is that under the special criteria applied to banks, the EC
authorities are automatically excluded from Midland/Lloyds. Their right
under the same legislation to deal with the Hong Kong bid is far from clear
either, notwithstanding confirmation yesterday that a preliminary one month
investigation is to go ahead.
The investment community should therefore be prepared for a fierce battle
for turf in which politics may well play as big a part as strict
interpretation of the law. Brussels is every bit as jealous of its
sovereignty as the British government, and in any case the EC's merger team
has long been thirsting to get its hands on a juicy British bid. Sir Leon
will hardly want to end his term as Competition Commissioner with a whimper.
The reaction in London in any case might conceivably be to let him get on
with it. The UK would not be the first EC member state to allow Brussels to
handle the political hot potatoes.

FT  29 APR 92 / The Lex Column: Midland's dark horse
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
On the surface, Lloyds' proposed bid for Midland should have been a
knock-out. But although its initial value was just over the top market
estimates of Midland's worth, the target's price was remarkably slow to
respond. By yesterday's close it was still 12 per cent below the 447p level
where the Lloyds offer had settled. That hardly suggests investors believe
Lloyds will win its looming battle with the competition authorities.
Were it to succeed, the deal would look attractive even at this heady price.
HSBC cannot point to Pounds 700m in cost savings through rationalisation -
though it must be a source of shame to British clearing banks that their
industry is carrying so much fat. The deal would involve a hefty goodwill
write-off, and there would be a Pounds 550m restructuring charge. But the
merged entity would still have a tier 1 capital ratio of over 5 per cent
even before touching Lloyds' Pounds 900m of surplus provisions for Third
World debt.
But the competition policy issue is serious, even though the debate will be
highly political and the outcome can only be guessed at. Lloyds' argument
that consumers will benefit from orderly rationalisation in an over-supplied
market may be readily appreciated - though not automatically accepted - by
those familiar with the industry. It looks less convincing to a general
public worried about redundancies and small businesses.
But Lloyds has already succeeded in making its rival look even less generous
than before. Lloyds' offer may not represent a realistic valuation of
Midland, if it turns out to be based on an anti-competitive strategy. But
that will not necessarily stop Midland shareholders holding out for more
from HSBC, which is thus on the spot. Any increase would be significantly
dilutive even if it could be built into the existing structure. HSBC cannot
offer more equity without upsetting its share price. There are already
doubts about the market's ability to digest its loan stock. Straight cash
might upset China. Midland's closing price yesterday was also marginally
below the HSBC offer. There is still a chance it may remain independent
after all.

FT  29 APR 92 / Smith tops Labour leadership nominations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN SMITH, the shadow chancellor, yesterday confirmed his strong head
start in the Labour leadership contest by winning nominations from 162 MPs,
about 60 per cent of the parliamentary party.
His lone rival, Mr Bryan Gould, shadow environment secretary, received 63
votes, only narrowly passing the 55 needed to qualify, leaving him a
mountain to climb before the July 18 run-off at a conference of Labour's
electoral college.
The contest for the deputy leadership delivered a surprise when Mrs Margaret
Beckett, widely seen as Mr Smith's 'dream ticket' partner, polled 89 votes -
markedly lower than expected in what is now a fierce three-way battle.
Mr Gould, who is running for both offices, recorded 69 votes for deputy
while Mr John Prescott, candidate of the traditional Labour left, was just
five votes behind on 64.
The party's hard-left candidates were trounced, Mr Ken Livingstone's
leadership challenge winning just 13 votes and Mr Bernie Grant, a candidate
for deputy, scoring 15.
The highly controversial preliminary phase of the leadership contest was
also undoubtedly influenced by the last-minute withdrawal of Ms Ann Clwyd,
the party's development spokesman.
She backed out of the contest, amid fresh confusion yesterday morning on
hearing that, contrary to her original understanding, Members of the
European Parliament had not been permitted to make nominations.
If Ms Clwyd's claims that she was close to the crucial 55 nominations are
even half correct, the transfer of her votes may have made the difference
between success and failure for Mr Prescott and Mr Gould.
The focus in the election now shifts to the unions, commanding 40 per cent
of the electoral college, and the constituency parties, which like MPs
control 30 per cent.

FT  29 APR 92 / Letter: Important issues raised by lease assignment argument
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr MICHAEL PATTISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The letters from John Banham (April 10) and David Lewis (April 22)
raise important issues. The whole question of privity of contract has been
reviewed by the Law Commission and in carrying out that review it has
consulted interested parties. The government is due to consult further on
the commission's recommendations before publishing any proposals for change.
This is undoubtedly an issue which landlords and tenants will approach from
very different perspectives. The landlord, perhaps a pension fund looking to
meet long-term obligations, when agreeing the terms of the original
long-term contract will have taken account of the status of his tenant. The
terms agreed will need to satisfy his requirement for an income stream from
the investment throughout the term of the lease in order to meet those
pension obligations.
If the tenant seeks to assign the lease before it expires, the fund would
probably agree more readily because of the protection available to it by
current law on privity of contract.
On the other hand, changing economic circumstances can produce apparent
absurdities such as those highlighted by John Banham. These can fall in what
seems an unfair way on a business which has changed significantly since it
signed the original lease.
Two points stand out. First, David Lewis is right to oppose abolition of
privity for existing contracts. Such a move should not be contemplated
without permitting the investment funds also to reconsider retrospectively
their agreement to lease assignment. Contracts freely negotiated between
parties having equal bargaining power should not be interfered with at some
later date.
Second, there may be an argument for abolishing the privity principle for
new contracts for the reasons spelled out by John Banham, although this
would certainly change the structure of UK property investment.
Setting aside any contract inevitably results in unfairness to one of the
parties. If the government chooses this option, then it must, at the very
least, do all it can to minimise the degree of unfairness through, for
instance, a long transitional period.

FT  29 APR 92 / Letter: New ways to fund Tecs needed to achieve training
revolution
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr PETER ASHBY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The call by leaders of training and enterprise councils for the
government to fund 'Investors in People' (IiP), to boost the expansion of
in-work training, is most welcome ('Tecs pressure Shephard on training
policy', April 27).
However, the proposed Pounds 20m budget for IiP - around Pounds 250,000 per
Tec - is hardly going to create the training revolution to which government
and Tecs are committed.
There should now be a fresh look at how new funds can be generated for Tecs
from the employer community, as well as the exchequer. One option would be
for parliament to grant Tecs the public law status enjoyed by continental
chambers of commerce - and, at the same time, encourage them to join forces
with their local chamber, as a number are now planning to do.
The Dutch system, which involves businesses registering with their local
chamber, and paying a compulsory subscription, could readily be adapted to
the needs of Tecs.
Where Mrs Shephard could take an important new initiative is in launching a
public review of the different policy options for funding Tecs. This would
take the debate away from its narrow focus on Treasury funding for Tecs -
which, even if granted, can always be cut.
Of course, the government should continue to fund training for young people
and unemployed adults. But let Tec support for in-work training, and IiP, be
funded through new statutory arrangements for employer membership of Tecs.
The Pounds 20m grant from the exchequer for IiP could then become a one-off
'kick-start' to get the ball rolling.

FT  29 APR 92 / Foreign Affairs: The real face of Sudan - Hassan Turabi, the
Islamic leader, presents a picture of his country unfamiliar to the west
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD MORTIMER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'That one may smile and smile, and be a villain . . .'
The line from Hamlet came into my head on Monday after an hour and a half's
conversation with Mr Hassan Turabi, the Sudanese Islamic leader.
Mr Turabi certainly has a villainous reputation. He is generally seen as the
brains behind the military regime in Sudan, which gets about as bad a press
as any except that of President Saddam Hussein in Iraq. Since seizing power
in 1989, General Omar Hassan Bashir has vigorously pursued the civil war
against mainly Christian rebels in the south of the country. He has
quarrelled with the international aid agencies, both official and
unofficial, which are trying to bring relief to millions of starving
Sudanese. He has been accused by human rights organisations of
systematically detaining and torturing his opponents, and by the US and
Egyptian governments of harbouring international terrorists. And he has
cultivated close relations with Iran and Libya, allegedly accepting Iranian
military advisers, while backing Iraq in the Gulf war.
Mr Turabi's Islamic Front (NIF) has been named in the Egyptian press as
training and financing 'terrorist elements' which allegedly planned to
assassinate Egyptian officials. President Hosni Mubarak himself has publicly
blamed Mr Turabi for the problems in Egyptian-Sudanese relations, saying
that 'Turabi believes he can spread his destructive principles to every part
of the world'. Sudanese opposition parties blame 'the government of Bashir
and Turabi' for sabotaging efforts to end the civil war. It is, according to
the Sudan People's Liberation Movement - the political wing of the rebellion
in the south - 'well known in the Sudan and elsewhere that Dr Turabi is the
man behind the current problems of forceful Islamisation, amputation of
limbs for petty theft, flogging for drinks and decapitation for adultery'.
Western experts and diplomats agree that Mr Turabi is a significant power in
the country. 'The real power lies with the NIF,' wrote the magazine Africa
Confidential last year, describing Gen Bashir as only 'a convenient
figurehead with a nationalist image'.
It therefore comes as a slight surprise that Mr Turabi is spending a week in
London, where he lectured on Monday night at the Royal Society of Arts, and
yesterday at the Royal Institute of International Affairs. According to the
Democratic Unionist Party (the main left-wing opposition in northern Sudan),
Sudanese exiles 'are bewildered to note country where many of the victims of
Turabi's regime are seeking asylum'.
In fact the two institutions were doing their job in enabling Mr Turabi to
present his ideas, and the exiles to challenge him. The exiles were outside
the RSA on Monday with slogans such as 'stop the use of food as a weapon of
genocide', 'foreign troops out of Sudan' and 'Turabi, the butcher of
Khartoum'.
Mr Turabi took all this with remarkable equanimity. He presents himself as a
modern and enlightened Islamic 'scholar', with no official position -
although his programme in London was arranged by the information counsellor
of the Sudanese embassy, who sat in on our conversation. Mr Turabi, who
studied law in London and went on to obtain a doctorate at the Sorbonne,
speaks excellent English and gives no hint of feeling rattled by western
criticism - unless it be a tendency to interrupt his own discourse with a
nervous giggle.
He also resists any temptation to respond in kind by demonising the west.
Asked by an obviously friendly questioner at the RSA to comment on the
west's sincerity in urging democracy on the Third World, he said it was
'very difficult to lump the whole west together', and that there were many
people in the west who would be willing to see Islamic parties come to power
by democratic means. 'Anyway, the west will evolve.'
Mr Turabi points out that he himself was 'detained for a short while' at the
time of Gen Bashir's coup, along with other political leaders, and that the
NIF, like other political parties, remains officially banned. He admits,
though, that 'most party members supported the new regime', partly because
'we were the only party in opposition when it took over' but mainly because
it soon showed 'pro-Islamic tendencies'.
Certainly he is ready enough to defend the regime against its critics, going
so far as to assert that people in Sudan 'have never had it so good'. Prices
of agricultural products have quadrupled, he told me, and as a result 'a
farmer now earns more than a civil servant'. It was, he claimed, 'mainly the
elites' who were suffering because 'government service is not paying so
well', whereas 'farmers and herdsmen, who make up 80 per cent of the
population' were benefiting from the government's focus on agriculture.
The government, Mr Turabi explained, 'didn't so much interfere' with relief
work as seek to replace it with development aid, so as to make the people
more independent. Sudan, he added, was now an exporter of food. 'It is
absolutely not true that people are dying of hunger.'
There were, he admitted, problems of access and distribution in some parts
of the country, but reports of famine had been exaggerated by the aid
agencies to justify their own activities and help them raise more money.
Thus he brushed aside, for instance, a UN report according to which 7.6m
people in Sudan are victims of drought and war, and 7.2m will need emergency
food aid this year at a cost of Dollars 471m.
Mr Turabi was equally dismissive of criticism of the regime's human rights
record - 'most of it misinformation' - pointing out that other countries
such as Britain and the US had resorted to administrative detention in
wartime. Sudan's record compared favourably, he said, with that of
neighbouring pro-western countries such as Egypt. It might be true that the
police 'mishandle' people at the time of their arrest, but the conditions of
detention were exemplary, as he could testify from his own experience: 'we
had refrigerators, newspapers, visits'. He denied reports of 'ghost houses'
and claimed there was no evidence of torture. 'Did anyone come with a broken
limb?' he asked.
As it happened, a member of the audience at his RSA lecture removed his
artificial leg and brandished it, claiming that he had had to be amputated
as a result of torture. He asked whether this accorded with the teachings of
Islam. Two weeks ago Amnesty International reported that 'prisoners have
been shackled and suspended from their cell walls, sometimes upside down,
others have had their testicles crushed with pliers'. This week a new report
from Africa Watch included a long first-person account of various tortures
by a released victim, and concluded that 'torture by members of the Sudanese
security forces appears to be becoming more sophisticated'.
The country described in such reports hardly sounds like the one Mr Turabi
talks about - maligned, according to him, because of western prejudice
against Islam. One would like to go see for oneself which version is right.
But the last time an FT correspondent did so, in February 1990, his attempts
to investigate human rights violations led to his being detained for nine
days, and then released on condition he left the country within 24 hours.
It is not very encouraging.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr NIGEL WILKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Can it come as any surprise that such a large percentage of British
companies neglect to file their accounts within the time limits set by the
Companies Act if less than 1 per cent of company directors responsible for
such lateness are actually prosecuted? ('Late accounts levies expected to
hit 15 per cent of UK companies', April 22)
Although this particular failure to apply company law is at last being
rectified by the imposition of automatic levies on defaulters, the
reluctance of the Department of Trade and Industry to apply the law does not
stop there, since Companies House shows little vigilance in monitoring
whether the content of the accounts it receives comply with company law.
Companies House only acts after the horse has bolted, usually when a company
has actually failed and creditors face substantial losses. The amount of
money that innocent creditors could be saved by effective supervision of
company law is positively mind boggling.
The shortcomings of the DTI in overseeing company law have reached legendary
status. It is time that the job was handed over to the police.

FT  29 APR 92 / Letter: Engineering - when status is irrelevant
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From A V DREW
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Ron Kirby (Letters, April 24) rightly states that more young people are
going into engineering via higher education and that salaries are better.
But before we get carried away into this brave new world, my daughter's
experience is salutary.
She expects to graduate this summer. She has spent the last 16 years being
educated. Getting 10 O-levels, three A-levels, all at good grades, winning a
scholarship and going to university. She has been influenced by me and the
WISE campaign (Women in Science and Engineering) to become a civil engineer.
She hopes to become chartered and has a real interest in transportation. She
has experience in civil engineering through vacation jobs with county
councils, carrying out responsible projects such as road realignments.
Since the beginning of the year she has written more than 50 letters to
employers of civil engineers. Most say they are not recruiting graduates
this year because of the recession. When she has gone for interview (on four
occasions) she is competing with sometimes more than 400 other applicants.
In short, the recession is dreadful and is uniquely cruel to 1992 graduates.
This current situation surely makes this present correspondence concerning
status and salary of engineers irrelevant if you don't even have a job.

FT  29 APR 92 / Leading Article: Shock therapy for Italy
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
ACCUSTOMED AS it is to feeble and fractious political leadership, Italy is
this week trying to come to terms with a new phenomenon: that of having no
effective leadership at all. The resignation of President Francesco Cossiga
on Saturday, following the departure of Mr Giulio Andreotti, the prime
minister, earlier last week, leaves the country without a head of state or a
government at a time when it is more in need of leadership than ever. Just
possibly, the consequence may be to push Italy towards the sort of
fundamental political reform that it has long been advised to adopt.
Although he sought to present it as a principled protest against the
politicians' refusal to reform the political system, President Cossiga's
resignation was no high-minded act of state. He had only two months of his
term left to serve in any case, and his announcement seemed laced with
personal pique that will do little to create the climate necessary for
constructive reform.
Nevertheless, at least Mr Cossiga's action has the merit of providing shock
therapy. It has underlined the lesson of Italy's recent general election:
that its political system has reached the limits of viability. The April 5
election delivered a serious rebuff to the long-ruling Christian Democrats.
It also resulted in an unprecedented fragmentation of the political parties,
highlighting the excesses of Italy's system of proportional representation.
Additional support
A nationwide protest vote, inchoately expressing a desire for institutional
reform and better economic management, has led to no fewer than 16 parties
being represented in the new parliament. The outgoing four-party coalition
of Christian Democrats, Socialists, Liberals and Social Democrats, still
possesses a marginal parliamentary majority. Yet with these parties' overall
share of the vote below 50 per cent, they need additional support to retain
credibility.
Any new partner, whether it be the centre-left Republicans, the former
communists regrouped in the Democratic Party of the Left (PDS), or the newly
emerged populists of the Lombard League, would demand a high price: the
clean-up of government, electoral reform, a curb on the Christian Democrat
and Socialist grip on the levers of patronage, and, in the case of the
Republicans and Lombard League at least, concrete economic measures to
ensure Italy meets the minimum requirements for convergence with the EC laid
down at Maastricht.
Tough choices
It is that European challenge which points up the current paralysis. To make
the grade for economic and monetary union, Italy faces tough choices - on
public spending, on subsidies to state industry, on reforming the pensions
system - that can only be made by a strong and stable government. That is
precisely what the present parliament will not be able to produce. If the
country is not to be relegated, as many of its politicians and
industrialists now fear, to the slow lane of a two-speed Community, it will
have to change its political system.
The most logical solution, therefore, is for the political parties to agree
on an interim government with a clearly defined but limited role. Apart from
implementing emergency economic measures to deal with the budget deficit and
inflation, such a government should concentrate on constitutional reform.
Parliament, in these circumstances, would have to act as a sort of
constituent assembly preparing for fresh elections, say within 18 months.
There is no shortage of proposals as to how the electoral system might be
modified - for example, by introducing tighter controls on the admission to
parliament of minority parties. There is also pressure in some quarters, not
least from Mr Cossiga himself, for the presidency to be given greater
powers.
Such ideas deserve consideration. But suggesting ways of strengthening
government is not enough. The established parties themselves also need a
thorough overhaul, for it is they - and the Christian Democrats in
particular - that have created the system of patronage and corruption that
is at the root of the trouble.
That is the true meaning of the election. It is a warning that Italy's
politicians cannot afford to ignore.

FT  29 APR 92 / Leading Article: The battle for Midland
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
TWO fundamentally different offers have now been proposed for Midland Bank.
The deal unveiled yesterday by Lloyds Bank implies substantial and painful
rationalisation of a type that the UK financial services sector has never
experienced. Symbolically, the name of Midland, once Britain's biggest bank,
would go.
The offer contrasts with the bid from Hongkong and Shanghai Banking
Corporation which has already been on the table for more than a month. This
is a very different sort of exercise. It will introduce new capital to
Midland and possibly reinvigorate its management, but it will not address
the apparent problems of overcapacity and poor returns on capital in British
banking.
At one level it is up to shareholders to decide. Normally the more radical
solution would be likely to be more profitable for them, although the
benefits from bank mergers in the past have often proved to be
disappointing. Indeed, Lloyds is offering a price some 20 per cent higher
than the Hongkong Bank. But this raises public interest considerations,
because although it would be acceptable for Midland's value to be enhanced
through increases in efficiency, the same would not be true if the gains
were to be achieved through monopoly profits arising from the reduction of
the number of major clearing banks from four to three.
Special safeguards
Although it is right that banks should be exposed to market forces by way of
takeovers, there need to be special safeguards as well: banks are different.
The security of depositors' funds is paramount, and in the case of the
largest banks, at least, it is supported by an implicit state guarantee.
There are also broader questions about the stability of the financial
system. So to some degree, competition must be subordinated to prudence. The
regulators must maintain a balance between the encouragement of sensible
behaviour by the banks and the availability of economically priced and
progressive services to the public.
Then there is the position of the shareholders: by and large they have been
badly served by their directors in recent years (though Lloyds has been an
exception). Midland in particular has been allowed to stagger from one
crisis to another over nearly 20 years during which its share price has
hugely underperformed the stock market as a whole. The bid battle erupting
over Midland is a welcome sign that even bankers are not immune from the
consequences of their mistakes.
Avoid a squabble
The crucial decision that has to be made now concerns the nature of whatever
investigation needs to be made into the UK's biggest banking reorganisation
since the mergers of the late 1960s. Both the European Commission in
Brussels and the Monopolies Commission in London may have claims for
jurisdiction, and it will be important to avoid a squabble. There may well
be a real problem here of overlapping jurisdiction: the European authorities
will be keen to get their teeth into the Hongkong bid, which is one of the
most important mergers to take place since they acquired their powers. But
at the same time, a probe into the domestic UK implications of a
Lloyds-Midland merger seems desirable. Although there is plenty of
competition in personal banking and big corporate lending, the same is not
true of lending to the small business sector.
Whatever the legal niceties, the desirable outcome is that both bids should
be scrutinised by the same competition authority, and that oversight should
lie within the UK. This is not to deny the possibility that Brussels has a
legitimate interest in this affair. But the main public policy issues at
stake here are domestic in character. Only within the UK will there be major
shifts in market penetration as a result of either of these offers.
Midland is the weakest of the UK clearers, and its future as an independent
bank is uncertain. So the fact that it is now on the receiving end of two
very different bids from well capitalised banks is to be welcomed. It is
right that these should be officially scrutinised. But there is a strong
case for a shake-up in the UK banking sector. There would have to be very
powerful arguments to justify opposition to either of these bids on
competition or other public interest grounds.

FT  29 APR 92 / Arts: 'Martha' and 'Un ballo in maschera' - Opera in Dublin
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A year or two after Ireland's two main opera companies came under the same
artistic director the arrangement would seem to be working to everybody's
advantage. The Wexford Festival is left to investigate the rare operas it
has always favoured, while DGOS Opera Ireland tries to satisfy the capital's
hunger for the arts with opera of an international flavour.
This year's spring season in Dublin pairs two contrasting operas: Flotow's
Martha and Verdi's Un ballo in maschera. Given the limited rehearsal time
the productions are respectable enough, but it is the imaginative casting
policy that invariably makes a visit to Wexford or Dublin worthwhile. The
best young Irish singers are found alongside promising newcomers from abroad
and a sprinkling of established names.
This was especially the case in the Flotow, which had a cast with no weak
link. When Martha was given its first performance in Dublin in 1859 the
singers included Mario and Grisi in the two leading roles, with Pauline
Viardot-Garcia as support, a remarkable trio, for these were not just the
most famous singers of the day, they rank among the most celebrated operatic
stars of all time.
These days it is young faces and fresh voices at DGOS Opera Ireland, which
works just as well in this opera. Or possibly better. Martha is one of those
homespun mid 19th-century German pieces, all springtime love and naive
innocence, hummable tunes and comfortable harmonies, which could hardly fail
to warm the heart, if handled with sensitivity. This delightful performance
did not put a foot wrong.
In the best tradition of opera productions run on a tight budget the
producer Dieter Kaegi and his designer Bruno Schwengl had devised a setting
that was as simple as it was effective: no political point making, no heavy
handed comic tomfoolery. The opera famously features Flotow's version of
'The Last Rose of Summer', but this staging was at least half Germanic by
nature, with its beer swilling yokels and Middle European atmosphere.
The successors to those famed stars of old were the Irish soprano
Marie-Claire O'Reirdan and American tenor Kip Wilborn, both fine voices,
attractive personalities. As the secondary couple, Ulrika Precht and James
Wood caught nicely the more outgoing humour that comes their way, the
Swedish mezzo in particular giving notice of a voice to watch. James
Lockhart was the conductor, who obtained crisp playing from the National
Symphony Orchestra. The whole performance kept sticky sentiment at bay.
The company's Un ballo in maschera had more ambitious aims. As befits Verdi
in grand opera style, this had aspirations to be an evening of international
class, which always poses problems. The conductor, Guido Ajmone-Marsan,
brought a keen Italianate drive to the performance, while the producer, Ceri
Sherlock, clothed the opera unexpectedly in Italian garb, moving the setting
to the Italy of Verdi's own day.
Otherwise the visiting principals had been left to do their own thing.
Maurizio Saltarin was the rather tight-voiced Riccardo, with the right
Italianate style, although one imagines it would be beyond the wit of any
producer to get him to sing his love duet to anybody but the conductor.
Carol Neblett made an appearance as guest diva in the role of Amelia,
somewhat blowsy vocally these days, though she has plenty of voice left and
shirks nothing. Frances Lucey was the winning Oscar, Jacalyn Bower a
forthright Ulrica.
The evening, however, belonged to the remaining member of the cast. Vladimir
Redkin, Moscow-born, Bolshoy-trained, sang a Renato of an impressive breadth
and vocal security which mark him out as yet another Russian baritone headed
for the top of his profession. The casting genie of DGOS Opera Ireland has
done it again: he is a real find.
Gaiety Theatre, Dublin. Season lasts until May 3.

FT  29 APR 92 / Arts: L'elisir d'amore - Opera in London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAX LOPPERT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
We owe this latest Donizetti revival to Luciano Pavarotti. He was due to
return to Covent Garden in La Boheme, which opera he then exchanged for
L'elisir before withdrawing altogether, leaving the work scheduled and no
tenor to lead it. Then the house's luck began to improve. Alfredo Kraus was
persuaded to take Pavarotti's place as Nemorino, and Sumi Jo to join him as
Adina.
The pairing, as shown on Monday, works winningly. Indeed, the display of
finespun singing offered by both provides a delectable treat for lovers of
the genre. It is not exactly a warm-blooded performance. Mr Kraus, an
exceptionally well-preserved sexagenarian of elegant carriage and patrician
profile, is hard to accept as a lovelorn peasant youth, graciously though he
lends himself to the capers of the Covent Garden staging. Miss Jo, a Korean,
seems to have been schooled down to the last eyelash-quiver, skirt-flounce
and pout in the Italian tradition of Adina-as-saucy-baggage.
Given that this production is already an indigestible feast of multicolour
cuteness, the shortage of 'heart' limits the composer's tenderly
compassionate view of human affections. But the singing is very fine, and in
Donizetti that counts for a good deal.
Miss Jo's pearly soprano, not large but perfectly projected and meltingly
sweet at every point in its compass, seems made for the lighter and
semiseria roles in the 19th-century bel canto repertory. She knows how to
float delightful, colourful sounds, how to thread notes and words into
phrases, how to caress a whole sequence; she is not just unfailingly lovely
to listen to, but a performer of musicianly charm - the demeanour may be
pert but the voice constantly arrives at a more genuine strain of artistry.
Mr Kraus no longer commands ripely resonant tenor tones, but those he has
are deployed with miraculous ease. Apart from the occasional unwritten - and
rather fierce - high-note climax, his is an art of suggestive
understatement, which reaches its peak in a 'Furtiva lagrima' offered as a
reverie, not a crowd-pleaser. One devoutly hopes his Nemorino will be viewed
as a sort of masterclass vivant by the Belcore of the evening, Anthony
Michaels-Moore. The most promising and normally the most stylish of the
younger British baritones, he allows himself to ham up the comedy and blare
out the notes with worrying crudity.
Dulcamara, whose presentation as an oriental potentate is one of the show's
many dislikable features, is taken by another veteran, Paolo Montarsolo -
amusingly at moments but superficially, and with very little 'real' tone at
his disposal. Richard Buckley, an experienced American conductor making his
house debut, keeps the show moving with considerable skill. A handful of
expressive nudgings and underlinings are a small price to pay for the
general feeling of 'go' in the air.

FT  29 APR 92 / Francis Bacon: Obituary
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM PACKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FRANCIS BACON, who died yesterday at the age of 82, remained to the last
what he had been throughout his long and active career, never so much the
enfant as the vieux terrible of contemporary British art. As uncompromising
and unabashed in his private life as he was in his work - which to him was
ever a matter of the utmost seriousness - there was nothing of the Grand Old
Man about him.
Yet he was a towering figure in his creative reputation, which was matched
only by that of the somewhat older and oddly complementary figure of Henry
Moore: both profoundly humane in their preoccupations, but the one dark, the
other light; serene optimism against a bleaker pessimism.
The difference was that Bacon was to find himself almost alone - the only
British painter in his time to be accepted, at home and abroad, as standing
by right in the first rank with his contemporaries in the world at large. It
is a paradox that he should have achieved such standing with work which,
even as it was being produced, was seen to be at odds with the trend of the
contemporary avant-garde: surreal expressionism, darkly romantic, above all,
figurative, in the time of formalist abstraction.
He was accorded two full-scale retrospectives at the Tate. At the first, in
1962, he stood alone: sui generis. By the time of the second show, in 1985.
the world had come round to him again. If, by then, the critic might enter
certain reservations concerning his later work on its own terms, seen in the
context of figurative expressionism revived - Baselitz, Clemente, Schnabel -
clearly he remained a singular and towering figure.
But that first retrospective in 1962 was the more significant; it came after
a career of barely 18 years as a painter. From the distance of the second
show it could be seen to mark a watershed in that career, celebrating the
substantive and astonishing achievement which would be enough to sustain his
reputation undiminished.
Francis Bacon was born in Dublin in October 1909, of English parents. He
submitted himself to no formal training as an artist, and as a young man
practised for a time as an interior decorator and designer. He continued to
paint, even to exhibit, through the 1930s, but he destroyed most of this
early work; it was not until 1944 that he again began to paint in earnest.
The mature achievement was almost Byronic in its instantaneity. Two
magisterial works of this first period, a sinister lurking 'figure in a
landscape' (1945), and the triptych, 'three studies for figures at the base
of a crucifixion' (1944), have rightly been in the Tate these past 40 years.
The next dozen years or so saw the production of the screaming Popes, the
dogs, baboons and chimpanzees, the early portraits, the figures after
Muybridge and, at last, the extended sequence of portraits of Van Gogh on
the road to Tarascon. By 1962 the full range of his imagery was established
and thoroughly explored, in particular the compositional device of the
figure encapsulated by an open, unspecific structure.
In the years following, Bacon's interest settled principally on the figure.
The scale was amplified, the image subject to all manner of formal
variations, but in essence nothing further was introduced. And as the
imagery settled into a certain predictability, so the old shock and impact
lessened. Attention fell more readily on the surface, and on the speed and
subtle dexterity of Bacon's handling of his material. It was what he had
said all along: what interested him was not the image for itself, not the
message nor the content as such, but only the painting as painting - getting
it right, making it real.
The problem with Francis Bacon and his work was never of Bacon's making;
rather it was always the viewer's. Arrested by the image, viewers found it
hard to move beyond it into the work itself. Perhaps it still seems strange
to speak of the physical beauty of Bacon's work, but with time it becomes
easier.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Michael Walker has moved up as the new chief executive of Clive Discount
following the resignation of Nic Chamberlen, who becomes non-executive
chairman.
Clive, one of the UK discount houses, has been owned by the Prudential
Insurance Company of America (PIC) since 1986. Until recently it had
functioned as part of the UK arm of Pru-Bache, the securities house, but the
latter has severely cut back its London activities. Clive is now a
wholly-owned subsidiary of PIC Holdings and Walker consequently moves on to
the main board of the American company.
Chamberlen, 53, had been chairman of the European corporate finance section
of Pru-Bache Capital Funding, and had been less involved in Clive in the
past couple of years, leaving Walker, 43, largely running day-to-day
operations from his position as managing director. Hence, while Chamberlen's
other activities have been wound down, he has not returned to an executive
position at Clive.

London Clubs International, the casino operator, has restructured its board
as part of its attempt to retain its gaming licences. Sir Gordon Booth, a
former senior diplomat and ex-director of Hanson, joins the board as
chairman. The present chairman, Richard Hanson, remains a non-executive
director. Peter Byrne, currently managing director of the group's overseas
operations, becomes gaming director. Tom Hodgson is joining the company from
Grosvenor Clubs, a rival group, to fill the new post of compliance director.
The appointments follow the resignation last week of Max Kingsley, managing
director, and five of his senior colleagues. Their resignation was widely
seen as an attempt to secure the group's gaming licences after a raid on its
London casinos last June. London Clubs has denied any wrong-doing.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
ROYAL BANK of SCOTLAND has promoted three of its top executives to the board
as directors, bringing the total number to 25, the maximum allowed by the
Edinburgh-based institution's articles of association. This means it has a
bigger board than any of the big four clearing banks, which range from
NatWest with 23 directors to Midland with 16. Royal Bank points out that
unlike these institutions it has no regional boards with their own
directors.
One of the three new executive directors is Peter Wood (above), the
44-year-old managing director of Royal Bank's financial services division
who founded Direct Line, the bank's telephone-based insurance subsidiary. He
sold his 25 per cent stake in Direct Line to Royal Bank in 1988 and entered
a service agreement with the bank. In the year to September 30 1991 he
earned Pounds 1.84m, most of it in the form of a bonus on top of his Pounds
275,000 basic salary, helped by Direct Line's good performance last year. He
became head of financial services in late 1990 when the division was created
by merging the bank's insurance, life assurance, leasing and fund management
operations.
The other new executive directors are Norman McLuskie, managing director of
the operations division, and Tony Schofield, managing director of branch
banking.

FT  29 APR 92 / Olivier Messiaen: Obituary
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW CLEMENTS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MESSIAEN'S death yesterday at the age of 83 has robbed contemporary music of
one of its few universally acclaimed and respected elder statesmen.
In an age characterised by schools and circumscribed aesthetic movements,
his pre-eminence stemmed from his singular achievement in forging a musical
language with profound implications for succeeding generations of composers,
while remaining absolutely wedded to his highly personal vision of music's
function.
Olivier Messiaen was born in Avignon in 1908; his father was a literary
scholar, his mother a poet, and his development appears to have been
precocious: he taught himself the piano and wrote his first compositions at
the age of nine. A year later he began to study music formally, and
encountered Debussy's Pelleas for the first time. Throughout his years at
the Paris Conservatoire, 1919 to 1930, it was to be Debussy's example that
provided the essential antidote to the hidebound syllabus he was compelled
to follow.
In 1931 he was appointed organist at La Sainte Trinite in Paris, a position
he was to hold for the rest of his life, and from the outset of his career
celebrated his Roman Catholic faith not by providing music for the liturgy,
but in producing works whose impulse and function were essentially
meditative. The organ cycles La Nativite and L'Ascension (originally written
for orchestra) characterised his music in the 1930s and have become
established as perhaps the most widely admired of all 20th century works for
the instrument.
During the Second World War Messiaen was interned for two years at a prison
camp in Silesia. Out of that confinement he produced what has remained one
of the most widely played of all his works, the Quatuor pour la fin du temps
(1941), written expressly for the composer to perform with his fellow
inmates. On release he returned to the Paris Conservatoire as a professor
not of composition but of harmony, and later also of analysis. A meeting
with the pianist Yvonne Loriod (who became his second wife in 1962) led to
the start of a series of piano works with Visions de l'amen (1943) and
Vingts regards sur l'enfant Jesus (1944). The piano was to remain an
integral part of his scoring, finding its way as a soloist into almost all
his conceptions, parts conceived expressly for Loriod.
But it was the premiere of his Trois Petites Liturgies in the newly
liberated Paris in 1945 that established Messiaen as a radical and
controversial composer, even if his avant-garde affinities seemed at odds
with his unabashed Christianity. In the post-war years his growing
reputation as a teacher, his open-mindedness and interest in a host of
western and non-western musical models brought many young, highly gifted
composers to his analysis classes and to the private composition seminars he
held in Paris. His early pupils included Boulez, Stockhausen, Barraque and
Xenakis.
In the 1950s he began an intensive and systematic study of the songs of
birds, 'the greatest musicians to inhabit this planet', incorporating them
into works such as Oiseaux exotiques (1956) and the huge cycle of piano
pieces Catalogue d'oiseaux (1956-58). From the 1960s onwards his music
tended to become ever more monumental and meditative. The culmination of
this line of development and indeed of Messiaen's life work appeared to be
his 'scenes Franciscaines', St Francois d'Assise, staged at the Paris Opera
in 1983.
Messiaen's was a non-developing art, and in that sense strangely foreign to
the Western art-music tradition. He was one of this century's most singular
and distinctive creators.

FT  29 APR 92 / Appointments: Opportunity of 'secondary space'
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Skidmore, Owings &amp; Merrill, the Chicago-based architects which also sustains
a significant interior design business, has hired Sara Galbraith as its new
head of interior design in London.
Galbraith, an American who studied architecture at Berkeley, has spent the
past seven years in London with Pfister Chadwick. Charles Pfister, whose
design business was merged with an English firm on his death a few years
ago, had once been a partner at SOM, so Galbraith - who had earlier worked
for another ex-SOM partner - says the style at her new firm is familiar.
Being a trained architect, which many of her predecessors in design at SOM
were not, is a decided advantage, she claims. 'You have to know how
buildings work - interior design is not just about picking fabrics and
colours.'
She says London offers marvellous opportunities at the moment, partly
because of the upgrading of 'secondary space', in other words refurbishing
existing offices vacated for the plethora of recently completed buildings.
'Interior design has remained an important part of our business despite the
collapse of the property market,' adds SOM director Robert Turner. One of
SOM's main claims to fame in London is as architects of Canary Wharf; the
company says its involvement is 'now virtually complete', leaving it 'not
overly exposed' to Olympia &amp; York and its current troubles.
Galbraith's biggest current project is fitting out the new premises for the
merged Manufacturers Hanover/Chemical Bank in Canary Wharf.
At Pfister Chadwick she had been working for Arthur Andersen which moves
into the building in Kingsway being vacated by Chemical.

FT  29 APR 92 / Management: Lies, damn lies and directors' salaries
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER LORENZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British company directors are a greedy and selfish lot. In the depths of
recession they are just as thoughtless as when times are good: they increase
their own pay far faster than that of their managers and other employees,
writes Christopher Lorenz.
Such has been the impression created by this week's media coverage of the
British Institute of Management's 1992 salary survey. This showed that the
directors of large companies received average earnings rises of 9.3 per cent
in the year to January 1, with salary rises of only 6.4 per cent for
managers in all size of company, and 8 per cent for UK employees as a whole.
The BIM's bombastic new director general, Roger Young, added to the mood of
general outrage by warning directors of large companies that they should be
seen to be tightening their belts. He declared that 'if they continue to
reward themselves far more than their employees, they will have to answer
for it' in the form of higher taxes.
Young was quite right. He should have been even tougher, pointing out that
such directors are worsening the 'them and us' gulf in their companies.
They are also acting in flagrant contravention of the ambitious employee
motivation and 'empowerment' programmes which almost all have launched.
As so often with statistical surveys, things are not as simple as they seem.
Precisely the same data could have prompted the BIM to congratulate the vast
majority of UK directors on setting an ideal example: taking either outright
cuts in earnings, or much smaller rises than their managers and other
employees.
It's not quite a matter of lies, damn lies, and statistics. It's more a
question of which category of data you choose to focus upon.
For one thing, virtually no newspaper chose to report the BIM's findings
that directors of companies with sales of under Pounds 600m - who constitute
the vast majority of the UK director population - took rises of between 2.1
and 4.6 per cent. The overall rise for all directors, including the big
boys, was only 3.3 per cent.
For another, the Institute's regional analysis (of all company sizes) showed
that in only East Anglia and the north did directors take markedly higher
rises in earnings than their managers. In London, the south-west and Wales,
and even Scotland, directors took far less than their subordinates - ranging
from a fall of 3.2 per cent in the south west and Wales, through no increase
whatever in inner London, to only 5 per cent in Scotland. For managers, the
respective regional rises were 4.5 per cent, 3.8 per cent, and 9.7 per cent.
None of this lessens Young's point that the big boys are both grasping and
foolish. If they cannot take themselves in hand, others will have to do it
for them - shareholders, non-executive directors, and, in the last resort,
the government.

FT  29 APR 92 / Management: Power to the people - Andrew Adonis describes
how one council has broken itself into pieces
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Big ceased to be beautiful long ago in Britain's town halls. For more than a
decade, decentralisation has been the craze in local government. But no
authority has taken it so far - or so fast - as Tower Hamlets, the Liberal
Democrat-controlled borough in London's East End.
The Liberals have divided the borough, London's poorest, into seven
'neighbourhood councils'. Each has its own staff, budget, offices and
elected committee responsible for executing most of the borough's functions
in its territory.
'Tower Hamlets only exists in name,' says Eric Flounders, the Liberals'
former leader - now chairman of Bow neighbourhood - who carried out the
dissection after defeating Labour in the 1986 borough elections. 'But that
was true before we acted: the constituent neighbourhoods were always the
real local communities.'
Tower Hamlets is a 1960s amalgamation of Bethnal Green, Stepney and Poplar.
Those names adorn three of the new neighbourhoods, but all seven are carved
from their territory. With 34,000 residents, the largest - Poplar - covers a
population greater than that of 27 district councils across the UK and would
be on the large side as a first-tier authority in France or Germany. But
with the smallest a mere 15,000-strong, even sympathetic observers think
there are a few neighbourhoods too many.
How was it done? At a stroke - almost literally. Amid uproar, the first
council meeting after the 1986 elections saw Flounders move sheaves of
amendments to council standing orders - creating the neighbourhoods and
disbanding most of the council's central committees. The central
administration was stripped to the bone and chief officers were obliged to
become neighbourhood chief executives. Few stayed long.
Neighbourhood units are not unique to Tower Hamlets. The model for less
radical reformers is Islington, in north London. Under a progressive Labour
administration, it has set up 24 neighbourhood offices across the borough:
all residents are within quarter of a mile of an office; each has a staff to
deal with queries - mainly housing - along with a small budget, and a forum
of local residents which meets every six weeks to discuss issues in its
area.
Yet Islington's central committee and administrative structure are still
intact. Tower Hamlets has largely disbanded both. Education, overall
budget-making and social service strategy remain with the centre; standard
terms and conditions are observed for employment contracts; beyond that,
everything - planning, parks-recreation, housing, highways, environmental
health, libraries, even most lawyers and accountants - has been handed down.
Political and administrative control within those spheres lies with the
neighbourhood councils, two of which are controlled by the 'opposition'
Labour party. Each neighbourhood has autonomy within its devolved sphere
unless its chief executive believes it 'is not in a sufficient state of
readiness' to implement a decision.
Even the direct labour-force has been divided, with seven separate depots.
Each neighbourhood has control over its own contracts: most have stayed
in-house, but Bethnal Green has awarded some to the private sector.
'It's a sham, of course', says John Biggs, the borough's Labour leader. 'We
run two neighbourhoods, but they set the annual budget, and that's clearly
fixed against us.' He condemns the devolved structure as 'massively
bureaucratic', pointing to the Pounds 700,000 salary bill for the borough's
chief executives alone.
Flounders denies the first claim: funds are allocated by formula, and losers
include Liberal neighbourhoods. He concedes that devolution may have
increased the administrative staff, but claims that this is balanced by
savings elsewhere.
'The positive advantages are enormous', he claims, citing the borough's rent
arrears. In 1985/6 arrears stood at the London average of 13 per cent of the
rent collectable. Now they are down to 6 per cent.
'It comes down to an argument about the cost of democracy itself', says Paul
Hoggett of Bristol University, who has made a detailed study. 'Neighbourhood
councils have to be serviced and administrative costs have gone up. But
service-delivery costs appear to be lower and the evidence suggests the
experiment has improved the quality of local democracy.' That is undeniable,
if turnout in local elections is a reliable guide: it is up from 31 per cent
in 1982 to 47 per cent in 1990 - a shift from well below to well above the
London average.
Clive Jacotine, Bow neighbourhood's chief executive and former assistant
director of housing in Lewisham, believes the experiment makes sound
management sense.
'The ability to bring everyone together easily, without having to get
involved in inter-departmental processes, is a great advantage,' he says.
Politics has changed too: 'The major conflict is between the neighbourhoods
and the centre, not between the political parties'.
Bow's management team comprises Jacotine and six 'service heads' - for
planning, highways, environmental services, economic development, housing,
and general-support services, including libraries. They all operate from the
Bow neighbourhood centre - a purpose-built block off Roman Road, which also
houses the local library, and a GP's practice. A gym and sauna are coming
soon.
The relationship between each neighbourhood's chief executive and committee
chairman is necessarily close. Flounders and Jacotine meet at least once a
fortnight. 'We get on well', says Jacotine. 'But if we didn't, I'd soon be
out: personal rapport is much more important than between a committee
chairman and a chief officer in a traditional authority.' Chief executives
are on three-year rolling contracts, renewable annually.
Tower Hamlets took control of eduction in the borough on the abolition of
the Inner London Education Authority in 1990. Under local management of
schools, most funds go direct to schools with the centre responsible for
strategy, inspection, and ensuring adequate servicing. But neighbourhoods
are still in the picture: they control the borough's Pounds 6m community
education budget, subject to oversight and inspection. They also provide
personnel and payroll services through 'service level agreements' with the
education department. 'But the position is clear,' says Anne Sofer, chief
education officer: 'The buck stops with the centre.'
Six years on, other councils have yet to copy Tower Hamlets. Even Liberal
Richmond, at the other, affluent end of the District Line, refuses to follow
suit. 'It's snobbery as much as anything', says Flounders. 'But don't worry:
give it a decade, and they'll all be doing it.'

Companies striving to improve their performance and prosper in the recession
should pay attention to how their employees think.
Research in America reveals that companies which test employees' thinking
styles and preferences can put together teams of workers who complement each
other.
By finding out whether individuals think with the left side of the brain -
logically and rationally - or with their right side - laterally - companies
can build competition-beating 'whole brained' teams.
They can further identify 'cerebral' people - logicians or visionaries  -
and 'limbic' people - organisers or co-operators.
According to CSC Index*, a consultancy which advises companies on thinking
analysis, individuals' preferences are strikingly consistent. Information
technology professionals - 'cerebral left' thinkers - have a strong
preference for analysing issues but a distinct lack of co-operative traits.
So they will present a well-argued case for introducing a new system but
will lose interest when it comes to teaching anyone how to use it.
Entrepreneurs - 'cerebral right' people - are off the scale when it comes to
'seeing the big picture' and 'tolerating ambiguity' but are lamentably short
on maintaining standards and developing detailed plans.
Herein lies the problem. Achieving the ideal 'whole brained' state means
putting opposites together. As people generally prefer to work with those
who share their approach, it involves a great deal of adjustment on all
sides.
But results from America are encouraging: one company reported that after
carrying out a thinking analysis, it promoted three executives to senior
jobs, for which they would not previously have been considered.
Of course, it would be even better if individuals could adopt a
'whole-brained' approach themselves. But perfection brings its own problems
 -apparently the rare 2 or 3 per cent of those tested who achieve a 'whole
brained' state are crippled by indecision.

LEWIS v ROOK
(FT, March 3 1992)
In 1968, Lady Rook purchased a property, Newlands, in Kent. Included in the
purchase were two cottages known as Nos 1 and 2 Hop Cottages on the south
boundary of the property, the total acreage of which was 10.5 acres. The
distance between No 1 Hop Cottages and Newlands was 175 metres. In 1979,
Lady Rook sold No 1 for Pounds 33,000. Section 102(1) of the Capital Gains
Tax Act 1979 provided that a gain on disposal of a dwelling-house was not
chargeable to tax 'if the dwelling house or part of a dwelling-house has
been the individual's only or main residence throughout the period of
ownership . . . ' The General Commissioners' found that No 1 Hop Cottages
formed part of the entity which comprised the dwelling-house of Newlands and
Mr Justice Mervyn Davies upheld the Commissioners' findings. The distance of
the cottage from the house was not of paramount importance in the context of
the Newlands set-up and was a matter of degree, he held. Allowing the Inland
Revenue's appeal, the Court of Appeal stated that apart from the 175 metres
between the cottage and the main house, Newlands was on the northern
boundary and the cottage on the southern boundary of a 10.5 acre estate,
separated by a large garden with no intervening buildings other than the
greenhouses and tool shed. Those facts led to the inescapable conclusion
that the cottage was not within the curtilage of and appurtenant to
Newlands, and so was not part of the entity which constituted Lady Rook's
dwelling-house.
KLEINWORT BENSON LTD v
CITY OF GLASGOW DISTRICT COUNCIL
BARCLAYS BANK PLC v
CITY OF GLASGOW DISTRICT COUNCIL
(FT, March 4 1992)
Two banks, Barclays Bank and Kleinwort Benson sued the City of Glasgow
District Council in two separate actions, for Pounds 389,431 and Pounds
807,230 respectively, in relation to sums paid under interest rate swap
agreements. Following on the House of Lords' decision in Hazell v
Hammersmith and Fulham (1991) 2 WLR 372 that all such transactions were
outside the powers of the local authorities and void ab initio, the banks
claimed return of the sums on a restitutionary basis. On the present
summonses, Glasgow sought declarations that the court had no jurisdiction in
respect of the claims and asked that the actions be dismissed. The two
actions came within the Jurisdiction and Judgments Convention 1968 (the
Brussels Convention), which concerned 'civil and commercial matters'.
Article 5(1) provided that a person domiciled in part of the UK might be
sued in another part 'in matters relating to a contract, in the courts for
the place of performance of the obligation in question'. The House of Lords
having held that the swap transactions were void ab initio, the suggestion
that the restitutionary claims were matters relating to a contract placed a
severe strain on the language of Article 5(1). There was nothing in the
cases to support such a conclusion, Mr Justice Hirst stated, in giving
judgment for Glasgow and dismissing the actions for want of jurisdiction.
OFFICIAL RECEIVER v NIXON
(FT, March 6)
The Official Receiver had been given leave to apply out of time for a
disqualifying order against Mr Nixon from acting as a company director. Mr
Nixon had been appointed as consultant to two companies and he had resigned
shortly before the receivers were appointed. The companies had left
unsecured liabilities of Pounds 1.54m, and Mr Nixon was charged inter alia
with failing to keep proper accounts and of allowing the one company to
trade while insolvent. In considering an application for leave to commence
disqualification proceedings more than two years from when the company
became insolvent (see section 2), the court should take into account (1) the
length of delay; (2) the reasons for delay; (3) the strength of the case
against a director; and (4) the degree of prejudice caused to him by the
delay (secretary of state for trade and industry v Desai, CA, November 29
1991). In the instant case, the Court of Appeal stated, in dismissing Mr
Nixon's appeal against Mr Justice Vinelott's decision upholding leave
granted to the Official Receiver to apply out of time, the evidence had
disclosed a sufficiently arguable case that Mr Nixon was either a shadow or
de facto director in the context of the actions he had taken on the
companies' behalf.
POWDRILL AND ANOTHER v
HAMBROS BANK (JERSEY) LTD
(FT, March 10)
Paramount carried on business as a charter airline and, in August 1989, an
administration order was made in respect of the company. In the present
proceedings, the joint administrators were alleging that in July 1989, the
company had sums of Pounds 1.3m and Pounds 346,800 which were transferred
from England to an account held by a Jersey company with Hambros Bank
(Jersey). They asserted that the payments were transactions at an undervalue
made when the company was unable to pay its debts and sought an order under
section 238 of the Insolvency Act 1986 for the bank to restore the money to
the company. The administrators obtained leave to serve proceedings out of
the jurisdiction. At first instance, however, the judge acceded to the
bank's application that that leave should be set aside. Allowing the
administrators' appeal, the Court of Appeal stated that where a foreign
element was involved, the court would need to be satisfied that the
defendant was sufficiently connected with England for it to be just and
proper to make the order against him. And in considering whether there was
sufficient connection, the court had to look at all the circumstances of the
case. If, in the present instance, the proceedings were to go ahead in
England, the bank would not be precluded from raising the issue of whether
there was sufficient connection with England as a defence.
WEBB v WEBB
(FT, March 11)
Mr George Webb bought a flat in Antibes in France and transferred it into
the name of his son, Lawrence Webb. The purchase price of FFr600,000 was
provided by the father and was placed pending completion in an account in
the son's name at the Antibes branch of Barclays Bank. Both father and son
used the property as a holiday home but the father then sought to have the
use of the property to the exclusion of the son and to have his son transfer
it into his name. In the ensuing High Court action, the judge held that
Article 16(1)(c) in the 1968 Brussels Convention, which stipulated that only
courts of the contracting state have the jurisdiction to decide on property
(rights in rem) of the contracting state in which the property is situated,
was not applicable. Adjourning the son's appeal, the Court of Appeal stated
that the proper scope of article 16(1) might depend on identification of the
policy underlying the article. The European Court was the appropriate forum
to identify the correct purposive interpretation of article 16(1) in its
application to the facts of the case.
MCALPINE HUMBEROAK LTD v
MCDERMOTT INTERNATIONAL INC
(FT, March 13)
In a contract for construction of the deck structure of an off-shore
drilling rig, placed with the defendants, McDermott, four subcontracts were
awarded to the plaintiffs, McAlpine. Delays ensued and the costs actually
incurred by McAlpine came to Pounds 2.59m but it claimed Pounds 3.54m,
maintaining that that sum was due under the contract, or as damages for
breach of contract. The judge found that the contract had been frustrated
and awarded McAlpine a quantum meruit equal to its costs plus 10 per cent
profit, less Pounds 1m already paid by McDermott. He dismissed McDermott's
counterclaim. Allowing McDermott's appeal, the Court of Appeal stated that
the inherent probabilities, the contemporaneous documents, and the
overwhelming weight of the oral evidence, all pointed in one direction. The
cause of delay in starting fabrication was McAlpine's failure to qualify its
procedures. It had nothing to do with the causes found by the judge so that
the contract had not been frustrated and the lump sum price had not been
displaced.

FT  29 APR 92 / Business and the Environment: Noise goes out with a bang
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
On a trip to Hong Kong in the early 1980s, Ulrich Schoene recalls seeing an
old mattress wrapped around a hydraulic hammer to muffle the noise as it
toiled away on one of the colony's construction sites.
A rough and ready solution, perhaps, to the noise from large hammers - or
breakers - attached to the booms of heavy-duty excavators. Hydraulic
hammers, invented by Krupp Maschinentechnik in 1963, may be one of the most
economical tools available to the building trade and other industries, but
few would deny they are a noise nuisance, especially in residential areas.
Increasingly, says Schoene, head of Krupp Maschinentechnik's construction
division, noise is being seen as pollution. Companies such as Krupp, which
claims about 20 per cent of the world hydraulic hammer market, Sweden's
Atlas Copco, and Furukawa of Japan, are being forced to respond.
The pressure takes two forms: the first is a demand for quieter hammers,
which - along with many aspects of environmental legislation - originated in
Germany a decade ago and is rapidly spreading.
In the past year or so, the ripple-effects have crossed the Channel. David
Slack, UK marketing manager for Furukawa hydraulic breakers and rock drills,
says: 'Germany's always ahead, but noise is now very much a concern in the
UK.' The focus of attention, naturally, is demolition sites close to houses
rather than quarries in thinly-populated areas.
Krupp, perhaps because it is German, makes more noise about its efforts to
produce quieter hammers than some of its rivals. The product catalogue of
Montabert, the respected French producer, stresses factors such as optimal
production/weight ratios, output and reliability through design superiority
and quality, with optional sound-proofing thrown in as an afterthought.
While marketing may differ, though, all the suppliers are taking a similar
approach to noise reduction, and have come up with a solution that imitates
the mattress. While the working parts are more or less unchanged,
considerable improvements have been introduced recently in the housings that
encase them.
Atlas Copco's TEX-H breakers have a sound-deadening material integrated in
the housing, substantially reducing noise from the breaker itself, while in
Krupp's Compact System, introduced three years ago, the percussion mechanism
is suspended and damped by two special plastic elements.
The system is aimed partly at reducing the recoil on the excavator and
improving driver comfort, but also reduces noise by 5-8 dB. At 8 dB, this
means that to the human ear the noise appears to be only half as loud. Slack
notes that the approach taken by the industry has added about 12-15 per cent
to the cost of hydraulic hammers.
Krupp first began putting such boxes round hydraulic hammers about 10 years
ago, and offers a system which can be retrofitted to previously unprotected
hammers. But further reduction in noise levels is likely to be marginal, and
that still leaves a lot of noise from the sharp end of the hammer, for which
there is no effective solution.
The need to reduce noise, along with a second pressure on hammer users -
limits on hours of operation - has prompted the equipment industry to
introduce hydraulic concrete crushers as a substitute for hammers. The
massive, scissor-like crushers are fitted to excavators and rip into
concrete without the noise and vibration of hammering.
In environment terms, crushers have a further advantage over hammers. Their
ability to separate the reinforcing bar from the concrete as they tear a
building apart produces steel for recycling and pure concrete for fussy
landfill sites.

FT  29 APR 92 / Business and the Environment: Sweeping troubles under the
rug - Carpet manufacturers are facing mounting pressure to recycle their
products
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
About 5m tonnes of old carpets are thrown out every year in Britain, more
than 7 per cent of the country's industrial, commercial and construction
waste. Recycling them is one of the toughest problems facing
environmentally-minded companies.
The difficulty is that carpets are mixtures. They might include bitumen,
latex, nylon or polyester as well as natural fibres such as wool or jute.
Separating these components so they can be used again is expensive.
Yet a cheap solution will have to be found quickly. The supply of landfill
sites, where most carpets are dumped, is limited. Government departments
have a policy of encouraging recycling as an alternative. Already in
Germany, carpets cannot be disposed of in landfill sites at all. Other
countries and the European Commission are looking at the possibility of
strengthening their rules on the use of landfill sites.
The pace of change is worrying the UK carpet industry. Some European
countries may be asking for a recyclable carpet to be developed by the end
of the century, according to Hugh Wilson of the British Carpet Manufacturers
Association. 'This would mean huge changes for the industry,' he says. He
has asked the European Commission what environmental plans it has for the
carpet industry and is still waiting for a reply.
Some in the industry are not waiting. Companies in Germany are working hard
to find a way to recycle carpets. 'It's an emotive issue,' says an executive
at a German carpet manufacturer. 'If we say we are close to being able to
recycle carpets we will get lorry loads at our door tomorrow.'
He is cautious about the effects of possible legislation. 'The worst case is
that anyone who sells a carpet has to take an old one back. The best we can
hope for is that we will have to take only the carpets we knew would be
coming back.'
The German carpet industry is trying to pre-empt state controls and has set
up an environmental group, Gemeinschaft unweltfreundlicher Teppichboden
(GuT). GuT has instituted a voluntary seal of approval for carpets that are
tested to be free of certain toxic materials. Its members have also set up
programmes to investigate waste and recycling. Companies from Belgium, the
Netherlands and the UK have also joined GuT.
This embracing by manufacturers of the environmentalists' cause is not
universally welcomed. 'The Germans are making crosses for their own backs,'
says the British Carpet Manufacturers Association.
But ICI Fibres, an associate member of GuT, says that in Germany companies
must be seen to be taking a responsible attitude. The ideal technological
solution would be to have a carpet made entirely from polyester or nylon.
When it reached the end of its life it would simply be melted down and
re-used - either made into more carpets, or into low-performance plastics
such as for fencing posts.
But this is several years away because it is difficult to make a carpet that
uses the same material for both the pile and the backing.
The Manchester-based British Textile Technology Group has another solution
in mind. It wants to develop a hand-held fibre tester that will identify
automatically the materials used in a carpet. It has applied for Commission
funding to develop the device.
The British Carpet Manufacturers Association, on the other hand, favours a
return to the old days. Traditional carpets are made from wool with a jute
backing. When worn out, they could be burnt in power stations to generate
electricity, says the Association.
Ironically, carpets have been important in recycling for many years as an
end product. Parts of carpets can be made from old tyres, insulating panels
and flexible foam.
Now the industry is faced with the prospect of millions of tonnes of used
carpets, grit and all, being dumped on its doorstep. And users of carpets,
in offices, factories and homes, may have to pay more for new carpets to
help pay for the cost of getting rid of old ones.
In Germany, the industry is determined to take the initiative from the
legislators. Any carpet manufacturer hoping to sell into Europe's biggest
market will have to conform to the rules set there. Germany is setting the
standards. The rest of Europe may have to follow its lead.

FT  29 APR 92 / Business and the Environment: Boston buries its traffic jams
/ A report on a scheme to put the city's main highway underground
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTORIA GRIFFITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When George Bush signed a Dollars 151bn (Pounds 85bn) highways bill in
December last year, America's top road construction companies received the
news with champagne toasts. But they were unprepared for the backlash
against new highways by environmentalists in the US.
Despite America's love affair with the car, many states, including New
Jersey, Colorado, Maine and Florida, are rejecting highway expansion
programmes in favour of mass transportation and other
environmentally-friendly projects.
In Boston a Dollars 5.6bn highways investment, 90 per cent of which will be
funded by Washington, was nearly overturned by environmentalists convinced
that fewer traffic jams would encourage more car usage, and with it more
pollution.
The Conservation Law Foundation, a Boston ecological group, for months
fiercely opposed adding more highway space to the city. But the foundation
convinced city planners to modify the plan. 'I am very happy with this
project,' said Stephen Burrington, lawyer for the Conservation Law
Foundation. 'I hope it serves as a model to other cities facing similar
problems.'
The Boston project, awarded to construction giants Bechtel and Parsons
Brinckerhoff, will sink the city's central artery underground, widen it and
improve road access in other parts of the city.
For more than a generation, Bostonians have reluctantly tolerated the
highway, which cuts through the heart of the city. 'People here look at the
artery as a hulking green mass which carves their city to bits,' said Peter
Zuk, the project's head.
When the offending highway is buried beneath the ground, the city plans to
put parks, city avenues and a few high-priced real estate developments in
its place. Most important, as far as the Conservation Law Foundation is
concerned, is the city government's agreement to throw Dollars 4bn into
public transportation over the next few years and place strict limits on
parking in the downtown area. The foundation settled its lawsuit against the
project after the administration made those concessions last month.
Despite widespread support for the project, reaching a consensus has been
painstaking. Dozens of special interest groups approached the city with
legitimate concerns. Archeologists insisted on a project delay to give them
a chance to excavate the site.
Neighbourhood activists worried that the digging would send thousands of
rats scurrying around Boston. They forced the city government to allocate
Dollars 60m to a pest control scheme.
Fishermen have been latest to complain. The project includes an underwater
tunnel through Boston's harbour, and they were concerned that blasting would
disturb the fish population. As a result, the city declared a moratorium on
blasting during spawning season.
Delays caused by vying interests have caused city planners to move back the
estimated completion date from 1998 to 2000. And further complications would
make more delays likely.
The project, which represents the largest urban highway project ever
undertaken, is still far from problem-free. No one knows, for instance, what
the city will do if it comes across hazardous waste during digging. And
restaurant and shop owners in the city's Italian district, which borders the
artery, are nervous that customers will be put off by construction.
No one doubts the benefits to the city after the project is completed,
however. Studies point to the variously estimated fortunes Bostonians will
save by spending less time in traffic.
The new highway should improve truck shipments to and from the city. If
everything goes according to plan, Bostonians believe the scheme will be a
perfect marriage between economic and ecological development.

FT  29 APR 92 / PM rejects European super-state
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL, Business Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN MAJOR, the prime minister, yesterday pledged Britain to a central
role in a Europe of nation states but said he intended to 'hold at bay' the
EC social chapter, which would damage British industry and destroy jobs.
Mr Major, whose speech to the annual conference of the Institute of
Directors brought him a standing ovation, said he was not prepared to see 'a
centralised United States of Europe' which could never be in the interests
of the British people.
The prime minister emphasised that when Britain assumed the EC presidency in
July the completion of the single market would be its first priority. But he
made clear his determination to restrain the community from reaching
decisions which he believed would damage Britain or which could better be
taken at national or local level.
Referring specifically to the EC working time directive, which seeks to
change existing employment laws and to restrict working hours, Mr Major said
he was not prepared to wave through plans that would add Pounds 5bn to the
costs of British industry.
Attacking the proposals, he said he wanted it clearly understood throughout
the Community that unnecessary interference with working practices was bad
for business. He believed strongly in de-regulation and in getting
government off the back of business and was not prepared to let Brussels
intervene in areas which Westminster had decided to leave alone.
On the working time directive plans, he added: 'They are not for us. No one
should be in any doubt. A Conservative government will strongly oppose such
damaging regulation wherever it is found, and we will not readily acquiesce
in any attempts to impose these costs on our industry.'
Mr Major said the British people had recently voted against the restoration
of trade union power, and completion of the reform of employment laws was a
priority for his new government.
He said legislation would be introduced soon to make unlawful the automatic
deduction of union membership dues without written authorisation.
Individuals would be given greater freedom to choose a union and all
pre-strike ballots would be postal and subject to independent scrutiny.
Seven days' notice of strike action would have to be given after a ballot.
Mr Major said that in spite of the recession there remained a new spirit of
enterprise throughout Britain, with government policies making the country a
magnet for overseas investment. He added: 'It is high time people stopped
writing down our skills and damaging British manufacturing industry.'
Britain, he said, was set for a new era of prosperity, the foundations for
which had been laid by the recent election victory. The government intended
to 'root the values of enterprise, choice, ownership and opportunity even
deeper into the bedrock of Britain.'

FT  29 APR 92 / Engineering pay rises slow
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE RATE of increase in pay in the engineering sector continued to slow
slightly in the first quarter of this year and there has been an increase in
the number of freezes and deferred settlements, according to the latest

In the three months to the end of February the median pay rise was 4.5 per
cent, which fell to 4 per cent at the end of March due in part to an
increase in freezes.

FT  29 APR 92 / Nupe to ballot on Labour elections
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Nupe public service union yesterday became the first big union to agree
to ballot members in the election for leader and deputy leader of the Labour
party, David Goodhart writes.
The EETPU electricians' union decided to seek the opinions of a random
sample of 10,000 members who pay the political levy and of its delegates to
local Labour parties.
The refusal of several big unions - particularly the TGWU general union and
the AEU engineering union - to ballot their members reflects growing
friction between Labour and the unions.
Some officials believe the tension could help speed up a radical reform of
union-Labour links. Yesterday Mr Bill Morris, TGWU general secretary,
insisted that the union block vote at Labour conferences must be reformed,
but not abolished.
Mr Morris said yesterday he hoped many TGWU branches would ballot on the
Labour leadership. On Monday the union's executive rejected Mr Morris's
preferred option of a union-wide ballot.

FT  29 APR 92 / 'Perfect' deal sours for NSW premier
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT LOOKED like the perfect political deal. A troublesome Independent MP
resigns his seat to take a well-paid job in the public service, and the
government calls a by-election it is almost certain to win.
For Mr Nick Greiner, the conservative premier of New South Wales, it looked
too good to miss, especially since the extra seat would shore up his
minority government's crumbling majority. Nor was it a particularly unusual
deal. For the people of Australia's richest and most populous state, though,
it seems to have been the straw that broke the camel's back. And as
parliament debated a censure motion last night, it looked as though Mr
Greiner could pay a high price.
Mr Greiner's problem is that his Liberal/National party coalition government
controls only 47 seats in the 99-seat state parliament, the same number as
the opposition Labor party. The government is sustained in office by a deal
with five Independent MPs, who have promised to oppose opposition attempts
to win power in return for changes to parliamentary procedure and greater
freedom of information.
Two weeks ago, the government announced that Mr Terry Metherell, a former
Liberal minister who defected to the Independent benches last year, had been
appointed to a senior planning job in the state's environmental protection
agency. His five-year contract is worth ADollars 550,000 (Pounds 240,000).
No one suggests Mr Metherell is not qualified for the job. He has a
doctorate in planning law, and knowledge of government procedure and
practice which will be extremely useful to the agency. However, it emerged
that his appointment was actually to a special unit in the premier's
department, from which he was subsequently seconded to the agency without
its approval.
Furthermore, his application for the job was written after the publicly
announced deadline, and he was appointed without an interview, although
there are believed to have been 60 other applications. Mr Metherell denies
wrongdoing, but has refused further comment.
The government initially shrugged off opposition allegations of malpractice
and corruption, but was forced on to the defensive after Mr Greiner admitted
the appointment was a straightforward 'political deal.' Now the affair is to
be investigated by state's Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC),
and government officials may be called to give a first-hand account of
events to MPs.
There was uproar in parliament as a series of debates on the affair began
yesterday with a claim by Mr Bob Carr, state Labor leader, that Mr Greiner
was guilty of conspiracy to corrupt. Mr Metherell, he said, had 'swapped his
seat for a job.' Mr Greiner, clearly angered, branded Mr Carr 'a coward, a
liar and a hypocrite.'
The premier has his cabinet's backing, but is likely to be given a rough
ride by his own backbenchers when Liberal and National party MPs meet to
debate the issue today.  At least one Liberal MP is expected to call for Mr
Greiner to quit, and senior cabinet ministers have begun to prepare for a
leadership campaign if he is forced to go.
Independent MPs will demand his resignation if he is criticised by the ICAC
investigation. If the premier refused to go in such circumstances, the
Independents say they would put Labor into power.
All this is deeply galling to Mr Greiner, a Harvard graduate who swept to
power in 1988 after a campaign centred on the alleged corruption of the
former Labor government. As a student of political history, he will
appreciate the irony if he is forced out of office on the same issue,
especially if the death blow is struck by ICAC - the anti-corruption body he
set up after the 1988 campaign.

<TEXT>
THE New Zealand government yesterday announced a projected doubling in its
budget deficit for the year to June 30 to NZDollars 3.4bn (Pounds 1.02bn),
raising questions over its pledge to balance the books in the current
parliamentary term.
However, Ms Ruth Richardson, finance minister, expressed confidence that
increasing economic growth would deliver the revenue she needed. She said
the government remained committed to holding down spending.
The rise was primarily due to a fall in revenue due to the deep economic
recession, with business tax being much lower than expected.
The government also lost NZDollars 225m due to a technical change in
collecting the consumption tax, and had decided not to sell its recently
acquired shares in Fletcher Challenge, the leading local forest products and
industrial group, before June.
On budget night last July Ms Richardson forecast a deficit this financial
year of NZDollars 1.7bn.
This was increased in December to NZDollars 2.75bn. The latest forecast is
NZDollars 3.425bn.

FT  29 APR 92 / Japan's industrial production drops
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVEN BUTLER

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
INDUSTRIAL production in Japan fell by 5.3 per cent in March compared with a
year ago as the recession in Japan's manufacturing sector continued to
tighten its grip, the Ministry of International Trade and Industry said
yesterday.
On a seasonally adjusted basis, industrial output fell 2.8 per cent in March
compared with February. This was the fourth consecutive month of declining
output and sharpest decline since last June.
The size of the decline will make it extremely unlikely that the government
will have been able to reach its target for economic growth of 3.7 per cent
in the 1991 fiscal year, and increases the likelihood that the Japanese
economy is technically in recession.
Inventories fell by a seasonally-adjusted 1.1 per cent compared with
February in a further sign that companies are taking action to reduce a
large overhang of unsold goods. However, the process has some way to go as
inventory levels remained 7 per cent higher than a year ago.
Indeed, the decline in inventories appeared almost entirely attributable to
reduced production as industrial shipments fell by 2.7 per cent
month-on-month, while the ratio of inventories to sales rose by 1.2 per
cent.
Meanwhile, the Economic Planning Agency reported that the index of leading
indicators stood at 30 in February. This is the 18th consecutive month in
which the indicators fell below 50, which indicates a slowing economy. One
bright spot in the indicators was a revival of housing investment.

BRITAIN was yesterday criticised for failing to allow the people of Hong
Kong to exercise self-determination and was urged to introduce full
democracy into the colony before it reverts to Chinese sovereignty in 1997.
A report by the Geneva-based International Commission of Jurists (ICJ)
expresses serious doubts about protection offered to Hong Kong's judiciary,
its legislature and people by the Basic Law, the colony's post-1997
constitution, promulgated by the Chinese government in April 1990.
The report strongly criticises Britain for not offering Hong Kong's people
the right of self-determination in the form of a referendum over the terms
of the Joint Declaration. In the absence of this the report says Britain
should offer 3.2m holders of locally-issued British passports the right of
UK abode.
Robert Rice, Legal Correspondent, adds: Sir William Goodhart, the British
QC, who with jurists from Australia, Malaysia and Germany visited Hong
Kongfor the ICJ, said:  'The agreement was signed before the brutal
suppression of the pro-democracy movement in 1989. The big question is will
the Chinese government allow the people of Hong Kong to exercise the rights
and freedoms which it has denied so far to its own citizens?' Countdown to
1997. ICJ, PO Box 145, CH-1224 Chene-Bougeries, Geneva, Switzerland

FT  29 APR 92 / Earth summit to hear demand for environment fund: West urged
to be less secretive
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   KUALA LUMPUR
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
DEVELOPING countries preparing for the Earth Summit in June in Brazil
yesterday demanded the establishment of a special fund for the summit's
environmental programmes, and expressed 'serious concern' at a lack of
progress in negotiations with the west over financing.
The Kuala Lumpur Declaration on Environment and Development, approved by
ministers and officials from 55 governments meeting in the Malaysian
capital, conflicts with the western view that new money for the environment
should be channelled through the Global Environment Facility (GEF) managed
by the World Bank and the UN.
Yesterday's declaration called for 'a specific and separate fund' to be
established to implement Agenda 21, the 1,000-page series of tasks due to be
agreed in Brazil to clean up the world for the next century.
A predictable flow of money for the new fund should be ensured by assessed
(obligatory) contributions from developed countries, the statement said,
adding that the organisation should be transparent and democratic and should
provide financing 'without any conditionality'.
The developing nations have kept their negotiating options open by not
specifically ruling out the use of the GEF, although they regard it as
unacceptable in its present form.
Several western governments which sent observers to this week's meeting
accepted the need to reform the GEF by making it less secretive, extending
its mandate to include regional as well as global problems, and changing the
voting structure to give more weight to the Third World. Both sides agree on
the need for an unspecified amount of 'new and additional money' from the
industrialised countries.
Yesterday's declaration also called for a successful conclusion of the
Uruguay round of world trade talks and said developed countries should not
impose arbitrary trade restrictions on natural resources (such as timber) on
environmental grounds.
It said the issue of intellectual property rights should not be used to
hinder the transfer of environmentally sound technology on concessional
terms to developing countries.
The industrialised world should itself increase its forest cover and take
steps to change its patterns of production and consumption to help the
environment, the declaration said.
US officials have resisted the idea of radical changes to lifestyles in rich
countries, while Japan has recently sought to take the lead in addressing
environmental issues and and in promoting its own en-vironmentally friendly
technologies.
'Developed countries should fundamentally change their urban structure,
transportation system and lifestyle from the current industrialised culture
aiming only at economic growth for its own sake based on 'mass production,
mass consumption and mass disposal' to one more environmentally sound,' Mr
Shozaburo Nakamura, the Japanese minister responsible for global
environmental problems, told the Kuala Lumpur conference.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NEW CREDIT restrictions were imposed yesterday on 10 companies in South
Korea's Hyundai industrial group by their main bank, Korea Exchange Bank
(KEB).
KEB will not approve property purchases or industrial investments by the
companies until they recover money lent to Mr Chung Ju-yung, the Hyundai
founder, and his family in February.
The finance ministry last month warned that it would impose the financial
sanctions if the companies did not submit a timetable by mid-April for
recovering the Won248bn (Dollars 180m) borrowed by the Chung family.
No repayment schedules were filed, although the Chungs repaid Won51bn of the
amount in shares last month. The KEB said the loans should be repaid in cash
instead of shares.
The companies affected by the new credit restrictions include Hyundai
Engineering and Construction.
Although the decision is considered linked to the government's political
feud with Mr Chung, the finance ministry said it is also examining whether
the family owners of South Korea's 30 biggest conglomerates have also
borrowed funds from their companies for personal purposes, a practice that
was banned in February.
Mr Chung is believed to used the borrowed funds to help finance his new
anti-government political party, the Unification National Party.

FT  29 APR 92 / Peace offer to Burma's minorities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By OUR FOREIGN STAFF
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BURMA'S military junta yesterday pledged to end harassment of two main
minority groups, continuing a series of political initiatives launched in
the past week apparently aimed at improving its tattered international
image.
State radio said the ruling State Law and Order Restoration Council (Slorc),
which overrode the result of a 1990 general election to stay in power, was
suspending its campaign against Karen ethnic rebels 'in view of national
unity and goodwill.'
Since January its forces had been trying to capture the Karen headquarters
at Manerplaw on the Thai border.
In the Bangladeshi capital Dhaka, Mr Ohn Gyaw, Burmese foreign minister,
said the Slorc wanted the more than 200,000 Rohingya Moslem refugees who
have fled across that border 'to return to their homes as soon as possible,'
adding: 'There is no question of harsh treatment to our own people.'
The Slorc in mainly Buddhist Burma had previously insisted the refugees were
not its citizens. But refugee groups have said they will not return unless
human rights conditions improve in the western province of Arakan where most
of Burma's 3m Moslems live.
Since Gen Than Shwe took over last Thursday as head of the Slorc, replacing
the ailing hardliner, Saw Maung, 27 Burmese political detainees have been
released, with the Slorc saying it would release all such prisoners not
deemed a threat to national security.
Those released were said to include Mr U Nu, Burma's last democratically
elected prime minister, and four aides to Ms Aung San Suu Kyi, the
opposition leader put under house arrest in 1989 for alleged subversion and
who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize last year.

FT  29 APR 92 / Kurds prepare for election without a state / A report on a
process that some view as a luxury but which takes the 'safe haven' in
northern Iraq a step closer to a society
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MURRAY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT IS forbidden, according to a notice outside the village of Barzan, to
kill wild animals, cut down trees or use dynamite to go fishing. If this is
the evidence of how life for Iraq's Kurds is returning to normal, then the
6ft phosphor bomb casing close by is a reminder of just how fragile that
rehabilitation remains.
A year ago forces of the anti-Iraq coalition entered north Iraq to create a
'safe haven' for the Kurds. Now Massoud Barzani, aged 46, the shy rebel
leader, is taking the process one step further as the region under rebel
control since the allies withdrew in July prepares for elections for a local
assembly on May 17.
The Kurds, thanks in large part to the continued allied security umbrella,
control more territory than at any time since their struggle for political
autonomy began in the 1960s. For all that, they have still to resolve their
political future.
The poll may well prove a less than perfect exercise in democracy. Many
Kurds are still more influenced by the colour of a candidate's waist band
than anything said on the stump. None the less the process marks a symbolic
transition for Mr Barzani from guerrilla leader to modern-day politician and
provides a mandate to rebuild the society.
In Dohuk and other towns, the old Iraqi municipal rubbish trucks can be seen
sweeping the streets - with the hot summer months approaching this was seen
as a health priority rather than evidence of a new found civic pride.
A six-month Iraqi blockade has all but paralysed public services. Fuel is in
short supply. Aid workers believe the blockade was deliberately timed to
coincide with the planting season. As a result there could be a serious
grain shortfall.
On top of this the eight-party Kurdish Front is hamstrung by political
division. The Front has singly failed to stop some of its owns politicians
from stripping now disused government projects of hydraulic and other
equipment and trucking it to the Iranian border. Any new administration will
have to tackle these problems.
For three decades the Kurds have suffered unimaginable horrors - from the
gas attacks at Halabja, to the systematic destruction of up 4,000 villages
by Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's forces and the deaths of untold
thousands in the government's relocation scheme in 1988, the story of which
is only now being pieced together.
Turkey, or at least the Turkish military, also remains suspicious of Kurdish
intentions. Bombing raids over north Iraq, ostensibly aimed at Turkey's own
Kurdish rebels, have inflicted civilian casualties according to aid workers.
At Barzan the bomb casing was provided as the evidence.
Last Saturday, Barzani and the other Front party leaders each submitted 100
names to stand for a local administration of this disputed corner of Iraq.
The main election contest will be between Mr Barzani's Kurdish Democratic
Party and the Patriotic Union of Mam or Uncle Jalal Talabani. A third force
will be provided by the so-called Tribal society - former Kurdish militias
of Saddam Hussein - the jash or donkeys as they were known.
As son of Mustafa Barzani the revered tribal Kurdish nationalist who founded
the movement and whose image today adorns almost every street corner in
North Iraq, Mr Barzani commands huge support.
Mr Barzani is himself no less a proven guerrilla leader. Burnt-out tanks on
the Selahaddin road bear testimony to his bravery when last April he held
the Iraqi advance at bay with just 59 of his personal bodyguard. But his
style is quiet, his authority underpinned by a pragmatism which other
Kurdish politicians lack. Victory for him would represent a mandate to
return to Baghdad to revive the stalled negotiations on autonomy in a bid to
end the current stalemate.
The election may seem something of a luxury. The technology deployed also
seems somewhat misplaced, with guerrilla leaders already familiar with
satellite dishes and fax machines in their mountain hideouts, now smiling
from their own television channels, from transmitters seized during the
uprising.
Television is of course vital to the success of the campaign, not so much in
Kurdistan but in Europe and the US where policy towards the Kurds owes much
to western media coverage.
It is one of the striking features of north Iraq that so many of the
political posters are in English, in anticipation perhaps of the influx of
foreign journalists. Indeed many seem to echo the legal phrases of UN
resolution 688, which for the first time mentioned the Kurds by name and
which to many Kurds represents a moral commitment on the part of western
governments.
The United Nations has given its implicit backing to the elections as have
the Kurds' friends in the West - the main reason for Mr Barzani's swing
through European capitals last month. Recently, in the latest bizarre twist
of its year-long run-in with the regime in Baghdad, the UN sanctions
committee gave permission for the shipment of 2.5m voting slips, 10,000
stamp pads and 150 litres of indelible ink, describing it as 'an essential
civilian need'. It is a phrase with which few Kurds would argue.

<TEXT>
THE African National Congress yesterday released a draft economic policy
document marked by a moderate tone and a promise to eschew rigid ideologies
in favour of pragmatism.
The document, due to be debated at the organisation's first policy
conference on May 28-31, again raises the vexed issue of nationalisation,
but promises flexibility.
For the first time, the paper mentions the possibility of reducing the role
of the public sector through privatisation, previously a bogey of the left.
It promises that the post-apartheid tax structure will 'reflect the need to
create incentives for investment and expansion' though it supports a new
land tax and suggests expropriation of land, with compensation, to make
amends to blacks evicted under apartheid.
Meanwhile, South African political groups took a further step towards
setting up a multi-racial interim government when a sub-committee of the
constitutional negotiating forum, the Convention for a Democratic South
Africa (Codesa), agreed on a cabinet-level council to act as an interim
executive until a new constitution is agreed.

<TEXT>
EXCHANGE rate guarantees to the German arm of Airbus Industrie were
suspended at the beginning of this year, EC officials told Gatt's subsidies
committee yesterday. But the EC said it could not accept the legal reasoning
behind condemnation of the exchange rate scheme by a disputes panel in
January.
The call by the US for immediate adoption of the committee's report was
backed by Japan and Canada. The US brought a complaint to Gatt in early 1991
as part of its wrangle with EC over state support for the four-nation Airbus
project. It claims the German exchange-rate scheme led to Dollars 2.5m
(Pounds 1.4m) export subsidy for each of 95 aircraft delivered worldwide by
Airbus in 1990.
Bonn has suspended the scheme for claims after January 15 1992, but it will
remain in place until the contract with Deutsche Airbus, now owned by
Daimler Benz, is renegotiated. The guarantee mechanism, designed to
compensate losses incurred by Deutsche Airbus for a drop in the dollar's
value against the D-Mark, was introduced in 1989 to sweeten the
privatisation deal involving the merger of Daimler Benz with
Messerschmidt-Bolkau-Blohm (MBB).
The EC claims the panel's argument is partial as it ignores provisions
governing support for the industry in Gatt's civil aircraft code. It denies
the exchange rate scheme was an export subsidy, saying it affected only
Deutsche Airbus' financial position, not the competitive position of Airbus
aircraft in the market.
The panel ruled it constituted an export subsidy on deliveries of fuselages
from Germany to France, but the EC says trade between EC member states does
not constitute an export. The EC is sole signatory to the subsidies code and
speaks for all 12 member states in Gatt. The subsidies committee will
consider the panel report at its next meeting.

FT  29 APR 92 / World Trade News: Finns invest Pounds 24m in TV tubes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NOKIA Consumer Electronics, the third biggest maker of televisions in
Europe, is investing Pounds 24m in a television picture tube factory in
Germany.
The company is to adapt production lines at its Esslingen factory to make
picture tubes for wide screen TV, which European electronics manufacturers
hope will be the next mass-selling consumer product in the television
market.
Nokia, a Finnish group, will also build a 6,000 square metre extension to
the factory and install highly-automated Black Matrix tube machinery. The
Black Matrix technology produces improved screen resolution, colour and
contrast. Its introduction will make Esslingen one of the most advanced tube
plants in Europe.
Production of the picture tubes on the 16:9 screen format will start by the
end of 1993. The plant will also continue producing tubes for conventional
square-shaped 4:3 television sets.
Although Nokia, Philips, the Dutch electronics group, and Thomson, the
French group, have been selling 16:9 wide-screen TV sets since September,
Thomson is the only maker currently producing 16:9 picture tubes. Nokia's
investment comes when European electronics companies are suffering from
sluggish consumer demand which has led to makers holding unusually high
inventories of about two-months' worth of production.
But Nokia expects demand for its conventional picture tubes to increase,
partly because European manufacturers are able to meet only about 8 per cent
of indigenous demand. Far eastern manufacturers supply the rest of the
market. It also expects demand for 16:9 picture tubes to increase as the
wide screen TV market grows.

SOUTH Korea's trade deficit shrank by 23 per cent to Dollars 2.6bn (Pounds
1.46bn) during the first quarter of 1992, contributing to a 14 per cent
decline in its current account deficit of Dollars 3.2bn.
Exports grew by 11.6 per cent to Dollars 16.8bn, outpacing a 6.6 per cent
rise in imports to Dollars 19.5bn.
South-east Asia was the only region with which South Korea enjoyed a trade
surplus, amounting to Dollars 1.6bn during the first quarter against a
surplus of Dollars 795m a year ago. South-east Asia overtook the US in March
as the country's largest export market.
South Korea's trade deficit with the US increased by 27 per cent to Dollars
965m, while its trade deficit with Japan remained unchanged at Dollars 2bn.
The trade deficit narrowed in March to Dollars 550m from Dollars 897m a year
ago, while the current account deficit shrank to Dollars 877m from Dollars
1.2bn.
Exports in March increased by 12.4 per cent to Dollars 6.2bn, boosted by
shipments of ships, cars and petrochemical products. Imports grew by 5.4 per
cent to Dollars 7.2bn.

FT  29 APR 92 / World Trade News: Israel basks in warmth of post-war tourism
revival - Quick recovery illustrates its role in Israeli and occupied
territories' economies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
WITHIN the Ottoman walls of old Jerusalem, the market traders and souvenir
hawkers who crowd the narrow alleyways around the city's holy shrines are
smiling this month. For both Jews and Arabs in the tourist trade are
enjoying a bumper season after the disaster of 1991 when the Gulf war kept
away all but the hardiest pilgrims.
According to initial estimates by the Israeli ministry of tourism, the peak
period Jewish Passover and Christian Easter celebrations drew a record
70,000 visitors. This is slightly higher than the previous record set in
1990 before the Gulf crisis cast its shadow over the Middle East.
To the end of March - before the Passover/Easter rush began - the number of
tourist arrivals was only a few thousand short of the 348,000 for the same
period in 1990. The contrast with a year ago, when less than a third of that
number came and the Old City streets were eerily deserted, could hardly be
greater.
The quick recovery, which began in the second half of 1991, has engendered
more than just relief among Israeli and Palestinian businesses involved in
the trade. It has illustrated the importance of tourism to both the Israeli
economy and the economy of the occupied territories. And it raises the
question of how great the potential for both sides could be if the current
Middle East peace talks yield results.
Smoothing out the effect of conflicts such as the Gulf war and the
Palestinian intifada (or uprising against Israeli rule) which periodically
afflict the local tourism industry, a little less than 1.5m tourists visit
Israel and the occupied territories annually. They leave behind them around
Dollars 2bn.
The vast majority of this revenue goes to Israel and it is a vital
contributor to the current account. Mr Gidon Patt, the tourism minister,
says that if the number of visitors could be raised to 3m - not an
unrealistic target considering the potent draw of history and religion, sun
and sea - the earnings would substantially reduce the country's large trade
gap.
On the Palestinian side, the Arab Tourist Industry Co-ordinating Committee,
an umbrella group of operators in the occupied territories, estimates the
share Palestinian tour operators take of the Dollars 2bn tourism revenues to
be around Dollars 100m. This does not take into account the earnings of the
large Palestinian souvenir industry and related businesses.
'Tourism is and will be one of the main income generating industries for the
Palestinians and will be one of the main contributors to Palestinian gross
national product. It will also be one of the main foreign currency earners
and will help absorb a high number of employees,' says a study by the ATI
committee.
Both sides agree that to exploit the potential of tourism in the immediate
area - and the region as a whole - co-operation and political stability is
vital. Operators in Jerusalem say just the fact that peace talks have begun
has already had a positive effect.
Mr Patt's officials have produced a list of proposals for simple measures
such as free movement of tour buses, hire cars and private vehicles across
borders which at present remain closed. He is anxious to co-operate with
Palestinian operators in tackling the 'Holy Grail' of both sides -
attracting Moslem pilgrims who are currently almost non-existent despite the
Dome on the Rock's status as the third-holiest Moslem shine.
'You cannot distance yourselves from the Israelis because you have to market
the area as a whole,' says Mr Hani Abu Dayeh, owner with his brother Sami of
the Palestinian company NET, the biggest tour operator in Israel and the
occupied territories. 'The future of tourism is going to depend on strong
co-operation.'
There are, however, big obstacles in the way. Co-operation means different
things to the two sides.
The Israelis, financially and politically the senior partners, clearly
envisage remaining in overall control of the industry. The Palestinians,
meanwhile, looking forward to a day when they have some kind of
independence, see themselves taking control of the attractions in east
Jerusalem and the West Bank - which include many of the main draws such as
the Old City, Bethlehem and Jericho.
The Palestinians also want to redress what they see as a deliberate policy
by Israel since the occupation in 1967 to suppress their industry's
development.
There is a chronic imbalance in hotel space, with Palestinians having only
about one-tenth of the Israeli capacity. Lack of investment is partly to
blame, but the ATI committee say licences to build have been withheld by
Israel. There is bitter resentment also at the strict rules governing
licences for tour guides which have meant only a handful of Palestinians
have been licenced as guides against 3,000 for Israelis since 1967.
There are complaints of commercially motivated harassment. Hani and Sami Abu
Dayeh spent 17 days in solitary confinement in 1989 after an armed tax raid
on their offices by the Israeli authorities who said their long-standing tax
return arrangements were illegal. The case is still unresolved and they may
yet return to jail for some months
Still, says Hani Abu Dayeh, co-operation on an equal footing is the only way
forward. 'The potential is vast. With peace we could catch up to the natural
level of tourism here - and that is so big we would not know what to do with
ourselves.
'Israel's travel agents, fighting to preserve their monopoly over cut-price
ticket sales, yesterday accused Lufthansa, the German airline, of publishing
an anti-semitic newspaper advertisement, writes Hugh Carnegy.
Lufthansa has run into opposition from the Israeli Association of Travel and
Tour Agents to its proposal to sell budget tickets direct to Israel
tourists, by-passing the agents and offering a lower price.
The airline ran full-page newspaper adverts on Monday in cartoon form
showing an Israeli couple seeking to benefit from Lufthansa's offer getting
the brush-off from a smug travel agent.
The travel agents association replied with its own adverts yesterday saying
the Lufthansa portrayal of the Israeli couple was anti-semitic. Many
Israelis who saw the Lufthansa ads - drawn by an Israeli artist - were
puzzled by the accusation.

TWO INTERNATIONAL accountancy firms have formed unprecedented joint ventures
in China which give them the same powers to operate as local firms, Andrew
Jack writes.
Arthur Andersen has linked up with Hua Qiang certified public accountants in
Beijing, a branch of China's finance ministry. KPMG Peat Marwick has formed
a similar link with a second firm operated as a ministry subsidiary.
The agreements, ratified in the past few days, will give the joint ventures
the power to certify accounts filed to the Chinese tax authorities.

<TEXT>
MR John Compton is to be sworn in this week as prime minister of St Lucia
for a third consecutive term, following the victory of his United Workers
Party in a general election on Monday.
Preliminary results have given the UWP 11 of the 17 seats at stake, with the
others going to the St Lucia Labour party led by Mr Julian Hunte.
Mr Compton overcame damaging allegations during the campaign that he had
been having an affair with an 18-year-old schoolgirl for the past four
years.
While not denying the claims, the prime minister said they were part of a
'smear campaign' and that what he did in his private life was a matter only
for himself and his family.
Mr Compton has indicated that this would be his last term.
His victory has cleared the way for St Lucia and the other Windward Island
nations ' Grenada, St Vincent and the Grenadines and Dominica - to create a
political union.
He pledged to hold a referendum on a European Community-style political
union by the end of the year. Mr Compton argues such a union is needed to
help the islands compete economically.
Political unity is supported by Mr Compton, but not by Mr Hunte who had
threatened to withdraw St Lucia from moves towards a federation.

FT  29 APR 92 / Argentina introduces tough curbs on technology exports
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BARHAM

<DATELINE>
   BUENOS AIRES
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ARGENTINA has introduced strict new controls on exports of sensitive
technologies, in a further step towards complying with international
pressure to curb development of its nuclear and missile industries.
Mr Guido di Tella, foreign minister, said yesterday the controls would unify
Argentine policy and align it with existing international controls on
weapons of mass destruction, nuclear technology and technologies with dual
civilian and military applications.
He said the loss of existing sales to countries without safeguards would be
replaced by new markets in the US. He added negotiations between an
Argentine company whose nuclear exports to Iran were banned earlier this
year and US companies were 'well advanced'.
Mr di Tella said the new controls would mean that Argentina could be taken
off an international blacklist of 'unreliable' countries, allowing it to
import advanced technologies like supercomputers.
Over the past two years Argentina has responded to intense international
pressure, especially from the US, to halt development of nuclear and missile
technologies that were a centrepiece of the once-powerful
military-industrial complex.
It scrapped the controversial Condor II intermediate-range missile project
and opened its nuclear industry to international inspections.
It intends to sign the 1967 Tlatelolco treaty this year, which bans nuclear
weapons in South America.
Despite the government's evident intention to comply with safeguards, there
is concern over continuing leakage of sensitive technologies through
informal military channels and the emigration of highly trained scientists
to Middle East countries.

FT  29 APR 92 / New economic allies begin the long haul
</HEADLINE>

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THIS week's decisions in Washington to admit Russia and other former Soviet
republics to membership of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank
have provided an important, historic moment in the process of integrating
the former Soviet Union into the world economy.
But the really hard work is only just beginning.
Difficult negotiations are in prospect over conditions to be attached to IMF
financial support for its new members and on details of the proposed rouble
stabilisation fund.
Russia and the other entrants will soon find themselves on a difficult
learning curve as they discover that the IMF and World Bank are no 'soft
touch' for easily available finance.
Although the IMF has produced an impressive battery of documents over recent
weeks detailing economic developments in Russia and the republics, monetary
officials admit it is difficult to tell what relevance these have to
conditions 'on the ground' outside the main metropolitan centres such as
Moscow and Saint Petersburg.
President Boris Yeltsin's remarks yesterday that Russia 'would not work
under the direct orders' of the IMF were a pointer to future tussles over
economic policy between Moscow and the IMF.
The detailed difficulties which lie ahead are symbolised by discussions over
the proposed Dollars 6bn (Pounds 3.4bn) rouble stabilisation fund, which was
agreed in principle by the Group of 10 industrialised countries this week.
The idea is simple: that the fund should exist in reserve to support rouble
parity once Russia has agreed to an IMF economic reform programme. Ideally,
as Mr Yegor Gaidar, Russia's first deputy prime minister, said on Tuesday,
the best use of the fund would be not to use it at all because that would
show confidence had been established in the rouble.
But the questions are many.
Nobody knows what the rouble parity should be, although the Russian
government feels existing market-determined rates undervalue the currency.
The future regime for the rouble is open. Will it be fixed, put in a
crawling peg of adjustable rates or float? G10 senior officials have
suggested at least an initial period of floating, while Mr Gaidar favours
fluctuation margins of 7.5 per cent either side of an eventual parity.
What, if any, will be the anchor currency for the rouble? Will it be the
Ecu, as proposed by Mr Norman Lamont, the UK chancellor, or the dollar as
suggested by Mr Gaidar?
What will be the arrangements to ensure that monetary policy in the other
countries of the planned rouble zone does not undermine the currency?
It is also far from clear whether the industrialised countries agree on how
the fund should operate. Mr Helmut Schlesinger, Bundesbank president, has
suggested it should run for only one year and that extensions be agreed
among the G10. This would keep the Russians on a short leash.
The stabilisation fund itself will only come into effect when Russia and the
republics have satisfied the IMF and G10 that they have effective
macro-economic and structural reform programmes in place. It is therefore
far from certain that it can be established in time for Russia's planned
move to a unified exchange rate for the rouble on July 1.
It is little wonder that some senior western monetary officials privately
doubt whether the fund will come into being at all.
But the stabilisation fund is only a small part of a bigger and more
confusing mosaic.
'The big question is how much they - that is their government, the country
and the Russian political community - recognise the true magnitude of what
faces them,' one senior western official mused this week.
Mr Gaidar spoke of Russia having a stable and high rate of growth after five
years. Some western officials talk of a 25-year process of economic
rehabilitation for Russia and the republics.
Ominous parallels are drawn with the Latin American debt crisis of the
1980s. That is only now resolving itself after nearly 10 years. Yet the
Latin American countries had experience of the market economy and
market-orientated structures in place; Russia and its neighbours have none
of these.
But Russia clearly has one asset in the shape of Mr Gaidar. Mr Nicholas
Brady, US Treasury secretary, expressed a fairly general view of Russia's
deputy prime minister when he described him as 'an enormously convincing
person'.

FT  29 APR 92 / IMF gloomy on outlook for the Baltic republics
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE International Monetary Fund has delivered a grim prognosis for the
economies of the three Baltic republics.
In separate studies of the three newly independent countries, the IMF
describes the economic outlook for Latvia and Lithuania this year as
'bleak', while it calls Estonia's economic situation 'precarious'.
Latvia faces a drop in real gross domestic product of as much as 30 per cent
this year after an 8 per cent decline in 1991. Some enterprises are being
forced to halt activity because of shortages of energy and other raw
materials.
In Lithuania, many enterprises will face the same fuel shortages unless the
disruption to trade with other republics of the former Soviet Union is
overcome.
Even if it succeeds in this, the IMF expects Lithuania's output to decline
by at least 15 per cent and possibly by more than 30 per cent, on top of the
20 per cent decline recorded in 1990-91.
Estonia's 'already precarious economic situation' has been exacerbated, the
IMF says, by the dislocation of its trade with other former Soviet republics
and the shock caused by the higher cost of imports at world market prices.
'The prospect for 1992 is for a further fall in real GDP, perhaps of the
order of 20 per cent, even if trade relations with other republics can be
normalised,' the Fund's study warns. Inflation has raged in all three
republics, topping 200 per cent last year in Lithuania and Estonia and
exceeding 300 per cent in Latvia.
The republics plan to introduce their own currencies, but this may be
delayed until later this year. While they continue to use the rouble, their
inflation performance will be tied to Russia's.
For Estonia, inflation may exceed 400 per cent this year, the IMF says, but
in Lithuania the introduction of its new currency, the litas, 'will provide
an opportunity to achieve a sharp reduction in the wage-price spiral'.

FT  29 APR 92 / Finance ministers appeal for swift trade liberalisation deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FINANCE ministers from industrial and developing countries yesterday issued
an urgent call for a swift agreement to liberalise world trade.
Meeting in the interim committee of the International Monetary Fund - the
Washington-based organisation's principal policy-making body - the finance
ministers said a rapid conclusion of the Uruguay Round of the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt) was essential to restore dynamism to
world trade and would contribute to economic recovery.
'All countries stand to benefit from the round, and would suffer from a
failure,' the committee said in a communique.
'The success of the negotiations is a must.'
Mr Carlos Solchaga, Spain's finance minister and the chairman of the
committee, said it was not easy to negotiate in an election year, but
expressed disappointment over the Gatt deadlock. 'It must be said that
responsibility is not shared equally among the different members of Gatt. It
lies mainly on the US and the European Community,' he said.
Mr Solchaga said the failure to reach a new agreement put the IMF in the
difficult position of asking developing countries to adopt 'perfectionist'
economic policies and open up their own markets, while the industrial
countries kept protectionist barriers to their goods.
'I feel that this situation isn't a very comfortable one,' he declared.
In other comments the interim committee communique:
Called for appropriate monetary and fiscal policies to assure recovery and
sustainable growth, coupled with measures to eliminate unproductive spending
and reduce public sector deficits.
Welcomed signs of a stronger economic performance by developing countries
and urged continued financial support for low-income nations from the IMF's
enhanced structural adjustment facility.
Praised the efforts of the countries of eastern Europe and the former Soviet
Union to reform their economies.
Expressed its concern that the IMF's quota increase had not yet come into
effect, and asked all members which had not agreed to the increase to do so
'as a matter of urgency'.
This is not the first time the committee has issued a call for a successful
conclusion to the Uruguay Round.
But Mr Michel Camdessus, the IMF managing director, last week acknowledged
that such calls had little effect.
'One of the deficiencies, if there are any, of the interim committee is that
you have there assembled distinguished ministers of finance but their trade
colleagues are, well, out to lunch in their capitals.'

   PARIS, BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Kiichi Miyazawa, the Japanese prime minister, will propose the
establishment of formal relations between Japan and the 51-member Conference
on Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE), in his talks with head of
state in Paris and Bonn this week.
Mr Miyazawa yesterday began a two-day visit to Paris and Bonn. He is due to
meet French President Francois Mitterrand today and German Chancellor Helmut
Kohl tomorrow.
His trip is intended to raise the profile of Japan in the forging of a new
international order to replace the old Cold War relationships - in which
stronger bilateral ties with the European Community, and closer involvement
with other international organisations such as the CSCE, are seen as
crucial.
Japan has so far not spelt out precisely what it means by a formal
relationship with the CSCE, which officials describe as 'an institutional
framework for the reinforcement of its relationship' with the organisation.
Pointing out that the group now stretches from Vancouver to Vladivostok,
they say that inevitably its concerns on security, disarmament and human
rights all concern Japan closely.
Mr Miyazawa emphasised yesterday that closer relations with France and
Germany were 'essential for the establishment of a new international order.'
It is understood Japan and the EC will have a summit meeting just before the
Group of Seven (G7) world economic summit in Munich in July to co-ordinate
their positions more closely. The G7 meeting is seen in Tokyo as the most
important forum in which Japan is a full participant.
After the G7 talks in Washington, at which Japan, as well as Germany, were
pressed to boost economic growth, Mr Miyazawa is keen to persuade Mr
Mitterrand and Mr Kohl of the genuine efforts to do this.
Today in Paris he will also meet Mr Pierre Beregovoy, France's new prime
minister, which will provide an opportunity to improve relations with Tokyo,
damaged by fierce criticisms of Japanese trade practices by Mrs Edith
Cresson, former prime minister.

FT  29 APR 92 / Brussels split over car industry training plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER and ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A PROPOSAL that the European Community pay car companies to retrain workers
is causing ructions inside the Commission.
The proposal calls for a major effort in vocational training and retraining
in anticipation of industrial and technological change, to help the European
car industry develop 'lean production' methods. These efforts would embrace
staff in companies or sectors undergoing change who need new qualifications
in order to adapt to changes in the nature and content of jobs.
Commissioners running social and regional programmes are concerned that the
proposal could result in existing funds targeted on long-term unemployment
and vocational training for the young could be drained away to private
companies.
Ms Vasso Papandreou, the social affairs commissioner, was yesterday pressing
for changes to the Commission paper, which was prepared by Mr Martin
Bangemann, industry commissioner.
Mr Bangemann's suggestions on training policy in the car industry anticipate
the Maastricht treaty, which has yet to be ratified, and policies to improve
the competitiveness of European industry in the Commission's new five-year
financial programme, on which member states are sharply divided.
Furthermore, some Commission officials are concerned that whatever is
decided for the car industry will become a model for EC industrial policy as
a whole - and that French car companies such as Renault and Peugeot will be
the prime beneficiaries.
The proposal, to be discussed by the Commission today, anticipates taking
money from the Social Fund - the 'structural fund' targeted on unemployment
 -to upgrade skills of car workers who are not being made redundant. 'It's
like robbing the poor to pay the rich,' one official in the social policy
directorate said.
'It is an enormously big step to fund training within companies,' he added,
arguing that this would eat into the Community's social role, with little
practical guarantee that the measures would be effective, or that companies
could not use the funds for general training purposes.
The policy paper explicitly rules out the latter, but it is notoriously
difficult for an understaffed Commission to keep tabs on the use to which EC
money is put.
As well as trying to equip EC industry with the means to face growing
competitive challenges in front-line industries like cars, electronics and
defence, the incipient industrial policy is also trying to address a
training gap. The Commission, mainly through the Social Fund, funds training
for the unemployed at the 'bottom end' of the market, while the Council of
Ministers provides finance for mainly higher education programmes at the top
end. Until now there has been no strategy for the 'middle' of the training
spectrum.

THE MURDER yesterday of Mr Joao Champalimaud, son of one of Portugal's most
prominent entrepreneurs, is the latest act in a drama that goes back to the
seizure of the family's business assets in 1975 when Portugal's revolution
took a sharp turn to the left.
Mr Champalimaud, 41, was shot and stabbed in his Lisbon office just before
9am. The killing is thought to be the consequence of a private grievance.
Before the revolution, the group headed by Mr Antonio Champalimaud, Joao's
father, controlled a bank, two large insurance companies, and many other
industrial assets.
Since then the family, operating from exile in Brazil where it owns a large
cement factory, has fought successive Portuguese governments for the return
of its assets and compensation. Mr Joao Champalimaud played a leading role
in the negotiations.
Two weeks ago the group won back control of Mundial Confianca, one of
Portugal's top three insurance companies which it formerly owned,when it was
privatised. Mr Champalimaud's father celebrated the group's return to
Portugal after 16 years, by warning that he would clean the company of the
vestiges of socialism and of all personnel 'appointed by socialism'.

reporters investigate a disturbing story of arms and the Isle of Man

<TEXT>
A SMALL company registered in the Isle of Man is at the centre of attempts
by arms merchants to use the Baltic republics as conduits for illegal
shipments of weapons from the former Soviet Union.
Two consignments containing 40,000 Russian-made small arms with a potential
market value of Dollars 4m were stopped recently in Estonia and Finland.
Both of them, described by arms industry experts as 'large orders almost
certainly bound for re-export', were addressed to Kennford Enterprises, an
Isle of Man-registered non-resident company.
The seizures have fuelled concerns that the break-up of the Soviet Union,
with the lack of border controls being exploited both by hard-pressed arms
producers and by soldiers selling their weapons, could lead to a flood of
illegal arms finding their way to terrorist groups around the world,
including the IRA. Customs officials said the guns seized in the Estonian
capital, Tallinn, were 'probably not the first and not the last'.
Estonia appealed to a meeting of Nato defence ministers in Brussels last
month for equipment and assistance to control its borders.
Containers loaded with 14,982 Makarov automatic pistols were discovered on
February 11 by Estonian customs in the port area of Tallinn. Shipment papers
described the contents as 7,200 'sports and training pistols', bound for
Kennford Enterprises in Finland. Estonia's state prosecutor is investigating
the case.
The guns came from a factory at Izhevsk, about 500 miles east of Moscow,
which makes hunting guns and military pistols. The city is the centre of
Russia's small-arms industry and a separate factory there makes the renowned
Kalashnikov AK-47 rifle.
Within days a second shipment of 25,000 similar pistols were seized by
Finnish customs officers in Helsinki. The automatic pistols are standard
issue for the armies of the former Warsaw Pact.
Kennford Enterprises was incorporated in the Isle of Man in April, 1991. Its
two shareholders and directors are listed as Artur Pukhov, of Tallinn, and
his wife Lubov Pukhov, of Helsinki. The Financial Times has established,
however, that these are merely forwarding addresses - the inhabitant of the
Helsinki address expressed surprise that it was being used for this purpose
by Kennford. The Pukhovs, both Russians, operate from Yaroslavl, north-east
of Moscow.
The company was set up by International Company Services, a Manx company
formation business. Mr Philip Robinson of International Company Services
said the request to form Kennford had come from a third party and not from
the Pukhovs. He declined to identify the third party, but said his company
received a lot of business from this source.
Speaking from Yaroslavl, Mr Pukhov told the FT that the order he had handled
was for sports guns but that the identity of the buyer was a 'commercial
secret'. He said that the fact that the sports guns had been replaced by
Makarovs was 'not my responsibility.'
'I have never seen the merchandise and never checked it,' Mr Pukhov said
through an interpreter.
He said Kennford Enterprises mainly sold oil and rare metals, including
scandium which is bought by the pharmaceutical industry.
Draft proposals for regulating the large number of non-resident companies in
the Isle of Man are expected to go before the island's parliament next
month.
A separate seizure of arms and anti-tank weapons apparently destined for
Armenian troops in Nagorno-Karabakh, the disputed Armenian enclave in
Azerbaijan, highlighted the problem of Soviet troops based in the Baltic
republics selling their weapons.
Under UK law, British companies can obtain Department of Trade licences to
import and export small arms of the kind seized in Estonia and Finland. The
countries with which trade in these weapons is banned are South Africa,
Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Yugoslavia, and Argentina.
Britain's Department of Trade and Industry said that the exports of arms
from the former Soviet republics was a 'matter for those countries not us'.
The UK Defence Ministry confirmed that it had been approached by the
Estonians on the small arms issue and said that it was anxious to ensure
that future trade in them was properly controlled.

AMERICAN sumo star Konishiki, whose chances for promotion have been as
closely watched in Tokyo as Japan's trade balance, publicly denied yesterday
he told reporters racism had kept him from the Japanese sport's highest
rank, AP reports from Tokyo.
The comments attributed to Konishiki, who real name is Salevaa Atisanoe,
caused an uproar last week, prompting Japanese officials to stress no racism
was involved. Konishiki said he did not even know some Japanese words
attributed to him in one article and had not spoken to the reporter who
wrote another. 'I didn't say any such thing,' he said, referring to the term
'racial discrimination' attributed to him.
Japan's mass media weighed in after the New York Times ran a story
attributing similar remarks to the wrestler, based on a phone interview.
Konishiki denied he had spoken to the Times' reporter, saying another
wrestler had impersonated him on the phone. Nihon Keizai stands by its
story; the New York Times says it is unsure whom it interviewed.

A BAN of more than 40 years ended yesterday with China's first horse race
meeting since the communists came to power being held in the southern city
of Guangzhou.
Horse racing was banned after the communists had labelled gambling one of
the seven evils, along with prostitution, slavery, kidnapping, drugs,
pornography and feudal superstition.
The meeting yesterday left a young worker from a city tax office richer by
50,000 yuan (Dollars 12,500), but not from backing winners.
Guangzhou's officials have got round the problem of gambling by charging 50
yuan (Dollars 12.5) for entry tickets which carry chances to win cash prizes
based on the results of races. The number of this winning ticket
corresponded to the numbers of the fastest horses in the first four heats in
order.
'It is completely different from the gambling in Hong Kong races,' said Wei
Zhenlan, director of the Guangdong Province Sports Commission, quoted in a
front-page report in China Daily yesterday. 'Instead of gambling, the prizes
are the only way to attract people to the race,' he said.
A total of 5,000 tickets for the six-race meeting were sold, creating a
dividend pool of 250,000 yuan. About 60 per cent of the gate money was
distributed to the holders of winning tickets.
Guangzhou's Huangchun course is on a former airfield built by the Japanese
in the 1940s.
Forty-seven jockeys from Hong Kong, Guangdong, Mongolia and Xinjiang took
part. A six-year-old Mongolian pony took top honours, winning the Jimma
(Golden Horse) Racing Championship.
Major General Guy Watkins of the Royal Hong Kong Jockey Club declared the
event a great success. He told China Daily: 'I've been to many cities where
amateur races are held, but the people did not have as much fun as they are
having here.'
The booming city of Guangzhou has once again beaten the port city of
Shanghai to the post. Shanghai's Liberation Daily newspaper announced on
Friday that the city would allow horse-racing for the first time since 1949.
A Shanghai business group has agreed with a Japanese consortium to build a
Dollars 10m racecourse for the city. The track will accommodate 10,000
people and use electronic equipment from Japan. No date has been given for
racing to begin, but Shanghai was a centre for horse-racing between the
world wars.

</HEADLINE>

   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MERCEDES BENZ, one of Germany's leading car and lorry makers, is to cut its
workforce by 20,000 over the next two years, according to Mr Werner Niefer,
chairman. 'Introducing such a short-term programme is urgently necessary if
we are to remain competitive, most notably with the Japanese,' he added.
Job cuts were only part of a wide-ranging programme, he said. The model
range had to be extended and production methods adapted.
The aim was to cut costs by 10-12 per cent. Other objectives were to
increase research and development links with components suppliers, reduce
the range of parts used in Mercedes cars and lorries, and improve plant
working times.
Reductions in the payroll would come from redundancies, early retirement and
natural wastage, Mr Niefer said.
The announcement followed broad hints from Mr Edzard Reuter, chairman of
Mercedes' parent, Daimler-Benz. He told journalists in April that the
subsidiary had 20,000 excess workers and that it would have to 'cut the
fat'. He suggested then that the cuts would not involve redundancies.
Mr Niefer, who is also Mr Reuter's deputy, said negotiations with unions
were continuing, although broad agreement had been reached.

FT  28 APR 92 / Poverty brings Tajikistan's political tension to the fore
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   DUSHANBE
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BIBI PARVINA, a stout, middle-aged Tajik woman, tied her head-scarf, shook
her placard and shouted angrily: 'This is what we want: Islam, bread, and
democracy]'
Her words sum up a set of political demands that are pushing Tajikistan, one
of the poorest of the former Soviet republics, into a bitter political
confrontation between communists and Islamic political factions.
Tension is rising, with the doubling yesterday of the thousands of
demonstrators, both for and against the government, who have taken to the
streets of Dushanbe, the Tajik capital. With about 10,000 anti-government
protesters camped out in the newly named Martyrs Square, and another 10,000
pro-government demonstrators half a kilometre away in Freedom (formerly
Lenin) Square, a long struggle may be under way. Government-sponsored
negotiations, begun on Sunday, collapsed yesterday.
This latest round of political conflict in Tajikistan was prompted by the
arrest last month of Mr Mahsud Ikramov, Dushanbe's democratic-leaning mayor.
The opposition Islamic and Democratic Party demonstrated to demand the
release of Mr Ikramov, suspension of the communist-dominated parliament and
resignation of Mr Safarli Kendjayev, the key government figure. The
opposition then took hostage 20 parliamentary deputies, later released them,
and forced a compromise: Mr Kendjayev resigned and the government promised
multi-party parliamentary elections in December.
Mr Kendjayev was then appointed head of the republic's KGB and thousands of
his supporters thronged into the capital; this triggered renewed opposition
demonstrations.
However, the root cause of the confrontation lies not so much with Mr
Kendjayev himself, but in the republic's bitter religious and regional
conflicts. His well-organised supporters were brought by bus into the
capital. They are bitterly opposed to the republic's powerful religious
leader, Kazi Akbar Turanjonzoda, and support Mullah Haidaar Sharis, who is
sympathetic to the government. Moreover, they believe that the opposition
plans to create an Islamic government.
The opposition, which denies wanting to impose an Islamic government, is a
fragile alliance of the Democratic party, supported by many Tajik
intellectuals, and the larger, more-organised, rural-based Islamic party.
The latter is co-operating with Mr Turanjonzoda and so far has been
relatively moderate in its aims. Its leader, Mr Mohammed Sharif, says: 'We
do not want to create an Islamic state by force. We want an Islamic
democracy.'
Meanwhile the government's attitude is unclear. Mr Nasrullo Dustuv, the
vice-president, says the government wants a peaceful solution but is
prepared to use force if necessary. However, the government would have to
rely on its own forces, since even Mr Dustuv admits the former Soviet army,
now under the control of the new Commonwealth of Independence States, was
unlikely to get involved. Moreover, a power vacuum appears to be opening up
in the government.
Most government officials insist that the real problem is economic. Mr Latim
Kayumov, the foreign minister, believes that when the economic situation
improves, the threat of Islamic militancy will vanish.
At the moment, this seems unlikely. Mr Edmund McWilliams, the US charge
d'affaires, admits that the transition to a market economy is likely to be
painful in Tajikistan, with its impoverished population, lack of hard
currency and grinding budget deficit.
'They have a lot to do, and not very much time. The social and political
pressures are rising,' he said.

FT  28 APR 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TRADING in stock index futures was volatile, with volume in the June
contract meagre, writes Joel Kibazo.
June was soon squeezed forward, sending it to 2,697 by 9am when a 50-point
premium over the cash market was recorded.
However, profit-taking coupled with the early dullness in both short
sterling and the gilts market caused a retreat, with June falling to 2,676
by mid-morning. Sporadic buying and selling continued into the afternoon,
until a large buying order from BZW late in the session triggered a squeeze,
pushing June up to 2,699, the high of the day. Finally, a sell-off in the
dying minutes saw the contract relinquish some of the gain from the squeeze.
June closed at 2,690, just 2 ahead of Friday's close and 13 points above its
estimated fair value premium to cash of about 18. Turnover reached 5,700
contracts.
In traded options, volume returned to quieter levels, totalling 32,075 lots.
Turnover in the FT-SE 100 option reached 9,627 contracts, while the Euro
FT-SE option recorded a mere 1,223 lots.
British Steel was the top traded stock option with a total of 2,165 lots,
the July 90 calls being particularly busy.

FT  28 APR 92 / London Stock Exchange: US buyers return for BP
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO, PETER JOHN, COLIN MILLHAM and CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH Petroleum received a much needed fillip for its dwindling share
price as a number of stories circulated in the market. The stock bounced 9
to 256p on 7.6m traded, with much of the interest reported to be from the
US. The buying was said to be partly prompted by an optimistic report in a
leading trade magazine about the prospects for the Cusiana oilfield in
Columbia.
Another report, originating from an independent Russian news agency, said BP
was negotiating the rights to participate in development of a large oil and
gas field in Siberia.
There was also speculation that the US authorities might be about to
introduce a more attractive tax regime for oil and gas explorers. However,
most observers attributed the rise to a technical bounce, and one story,
that Hanson might be preparing a bid, prompted cynical comments that some
traders could be generating rumours in order to square their books.
A decision by Rank Organisation to put its hotel business up for sale lifted
the leisure group's shares 13 to 739p. Analysts said the five London and 17
provincial hotels could have a potential price tag in excess of Pounds 300m,
although in the current depressed market that figure is debatable. However,
Rank let it be known that it was willing to wait years if necessary to exact
the right price.
Bears of Rank questioned the logic of selling one of its best potential
recovery businesses and the possible length of negotiations. However, a more
positive view was that Rank would be able to obtain a good price as the
hotel market improves, particularly for its prestige London sites, thus
reducing its debt burden.
Union Discount, troubled member of London's most elite monetary sector and
once the largest discount house in the world's premier financial market,
rose 9 to 138p on the disposal of its 'big ticket' leasing business to
French-owned Humberclyde Investments.
The shares still have a long way to go, however, after falling from last
year's peak of 600p, with Union's 'small ticket' business Sabre Leasing
remaining the worst problem, contributing to last year's group loss of
Pounds 23.5m.
Analysts said big ticket leasing, involving large items such as aircraft, is
saleable because of its tax advantages, but it would be a different story if
the small ticket office equipment business were to be offered for sale.
British Aerospace advanced 10 to 355p in brisk turnover of 7m as investors
appreciated the arrival of Mr Richard Lapthorne as finance director and the
winning of a Pounds 40m contract to upgrade Oman's Rapier anti-aircraft
missile system.
Contributing to the increased turnover were underwriters of last year's
failed rights issue releasing stock into the market, and profit-takers that
had recently bought shares at lower levels.
Food retailer Asda lost 1 1/2 at 27 1/2 p, after 26 1/2 p, on turnover of
17m, continuing the heavy trading seen in the stock during recent sessions.
The company is holding a series of meetings with securities houses at
present, and yesterday's decline in the share price followed a downgrading
by SG Warburg Securities, one of its brokers.
Growing belief that Lloyds Bank will bid for Midland, and that both banks
will benefit, ensured that Lloyds firmed 3 to 427p and Midland closed 6
better at 381p.
The market became aware that first-quarter figures from Sun Alliance were
encouraging, particularly following disappointing new life figures last week
from Legal &amp; General, up 11 at 382p. Sun said its new single premium
business was up by 150 per cent and its new annual premium business had
improved by 20 per cent. The stock, which has been the best performer in the
FT-SE 100 Index since the general election, gained a further 12 to 294p,
still a long way below the 392p price the shares attracted in August last
year.
Bargain hunters for property issues turned away from last week's star stocks
and sought other perceived value shares. Brixton Estates rose 7 to 176p,
Frogmore 22 to 318p and Capital &amp; Counties 26 to 221p.
Hopes of an economic upturn boosted stores in heavy turnover - although
County NatWest said it felt the sector was becoming overvalued. Investors
looking for recovery stocks were encouraged into Burton, which improved 3 to
50 1/2 p on turnover of 10m.
Shares in TI Group, which last week bid for Dowty Group, were in demand
after Standard &amp; Poor's, the US credit rating agency, confirmed an A1 rating
on TI's debt. Dowty added 3 at 180p.
Among transport stocks, Eurotunnel remained in the doldrums as the company
announced it was to appeal against a dispute panel's ruling in March that it
makes a Pounds 50m payment to TML, the Channel tunnel constructor, as a
settlement of the dispute between the two parties.
Wellcome fell sharply in early trading in reaction to a Sunday newspaper
article which raised doubts about the pharmaceutical company's anti-Aids
drug Retrovir and the origins of Aids. The stock closed a net 17 off at
1015p after being down 48 at one stage.
Bid speculation once again surrounded Fisons, which jumped 17 1/2 , a big
move for the stock, to 368p xd.
Neither a surprise announcement that ICI's US patent on its Nolvadex breast
cancer drug had been invalidated, nor concern over first-quarter figures,
held back the chemicals giant. The shares appreciated 9 to 1373p.

FT  28 APR 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equities poised to test all-time peak
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SOLID and determined performance by London's equity market, prompted by a
renewed flurry of takeover speculation, took the FT-SE 100 Index to within
21 1/2 points of its all-time closing peak.
A highly encouraging first session of the new two-week trading account left
the Footsie 15.2 points stronger at 2,658.2, compared with its closing high
of 2,679.6, achieved on September 2 last year, and its intraday peak of
2,683.7, which it touched on September 3.
It was not all easy going, however. Early in the session the market
struggled to keep its head above water, with dealers concerned about the
effect on international markets of public sector strikes in Germany, plus
the resignation of its foreign minister.
Wall Street's weakness on Friday and yesterday, and renewed concern about
the impact on the Japanese banking system of the steep decline in Tokyo
share prices, were other factors causing unease in London.
Opening some two points easier, the Footsie embarked on a sustained advance.
Helped by another good showing from sterling, which continued to improve
against the dollar and more importantly in terms of the D-Mark, the market
moved into positive territory within minutes of the opening and gathered
strength as the session progressed.
A surge in the Footsie future was said to have been responsible for the
initial strong rise in the cash market, although a 50-point premium to the
cash index was soon partially whittled away - eventually leaving a 31-point
premium - while the future settled at a 13-point premium over fair value as
the market closed.
Dealers said trade responded to a growing belief that the next few weeks
could well see a flurry of takeover bids. They added that the market could
easily cope with the worries about Germany and the G7 meeting held over the
weekend. 'We never expected G7 to be positive, and the German story has been
in the market for some time,' said one. He added that the institutions were
happy with the feel of London's recent performance against a background of
bearishness on Wall Street.
Strategists pointed out that the UK is viewed by international fund managers
as probably the safest bet, politically, of all the industrialised
countries. 'I would not be surprised to see London shoot through its
all-time high and test Footsie 2,700,' said one.
Banking remained the focus of attention, with dealers bracing themselves for
a counter-bid for Midland Bank from fellow UK clearer Lloyds. Barclays
attracted plenty of interest after confirmation that Sir John Quinton is to
step down as chief executive of the UK's biggest bank. NatWest's annual
meeting is set for today and Bank of Scotland reports full-year figures
tomorrow.
Oil shares moved back into the limelight, with US institutions chasing BP
higher amid suggestions that the US authorities may adopt a tax regime more
encouraging to the oil and gas explorers.
Turnover was slightly disappointing at 518.4m shares. Stock Exchange figures
revealed that the value of business last Friday was Pounds 1.33bn.

FT  28 APR 92 / World Stock Markets (America): US equities depressed by
supply worries
</HEADLINE>

Wall Street
US SHARE prices lost ground in quiet trading yesterday as concern about
supply pressures, and also economic statistics expected later this week,
kept buying to a minimum, writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 19.90 at 3,304.56.
The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 lost 0.57 to 408.45, while the Nasdaq composite
index fell 5.95 to 566.94. New York SE turnover amounted to 173m shares, and
declines outpaced rises by 888 to 773.
Last week's news that General Motors plans a worldwide offering of common
stock that could raise as much as Dollars 2.3bn has prompted the question
whether there is sufficient demand from investors to soak up newly issued
stock without sending share prices lower.
The market was also wary of the approaching US economic data, which should
provide an indication of how fast the recovery is progressing. Today is the
busiest day for numbers, with first-quarter gross domestic product, March
new single-family home sales, and the Conference Board's April consumer
confidence index all due for release.
General Motors fell at first but recovered to end Dollars  1/8 up on balance
at Dollars 39 3/4 in turnover of 2.7m shares as investors continued to react
to last Friday's announcement of a planned offering of 50m shares.
Compaq dropped Dollars 3 1/4 to Dollars 23 5/8 on 2.7m shares traded after
the computer company reported first-quarter profits of only 53 cents a
share, well down from the Dollars 1.26 a share earned a year ago.
The weakness in Compaq spread through the sector, with Hewlett-Packard
falling Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 77 1/4 , Digital slipping Dollars 1 3/8 to
Dollars 44 1/2 and Unisys easing Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 10 1/4 . IBM,
however, posted a slight gain of Dollars  1/8 at Dollars 88 1/4 .
Nike retreated Dollars 2 3/4 to Dollars 61 1/2 on press reports that it
could be faced with serious logistical problems if the European Community
introduces quotas restricting imports of shoes made in China.
Although exact figures are not available, a significant proportion of Nike's
sports shoes are made in the Far East, including China, South Korea, Taiwan
and Thailand.
On the Nasdaq market, US Healthcare climbed Dollars 2 1/8 to Dollars 47 1/4
in heavy trading in response to first-quarter net income of 63 cents a
share, above both last year's figure and the range of analysts' estimates.
In the same sector, Basic American Medical jumped Dollars 2 3/8 to Dollars
18 1/2 on news that Columbia Hospital (down Dollars 1 3/8 at Dollars 18 1/4
) will take over the company in a Dollars 185m stock swap. Medical Care
International declined Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 57 3/4 after announcing
first-quarter profits below market expectations.
Canada
THE TORONTO market weakened throughout the session in thin trading as
nervousness over the extent of Olympia &amp; York's debt troubles continued to
depress the real estate and banking sectors.
The composite index ended 23.2 lower at 3,326.4 and falls outnumbered rises
by 357 to 172 after volume of 18.7m shares valued at CDollars 211m.
Market heavy-weight Northern Telecom dropped CDollars 2 to CDollars 48 7/8
following analysts' downgradings.

FT  28 APR 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Punishing day for D-Mark
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GERMANY'S political and economic problems turned yesterday's foreign
currency trading into a black day for the D-Mark, which lost out to nearly
all the other major currencies. Its most punishing blows came in trading
against sterling, the yen and the French franc as traders took a gloomy view
of a wave of news coming out of Bonn, writes James Blitz.
The widening strikes in the German public sector, two resignations from the
Bonn cabinet and remarks from Mr Theo Waigel, the German finance minister,
all undermined the D-Mark yesterday. But traders also noted that sterling is
continuing to make gains in its own right, propelled by confidence in
Britain's government rather than mere disillusionment with the news from
Bonn.
The pound ended in London at DM2.9375, up 1 1/4 pfennigs from its previous
close. In morning trading it narrowly failed to reach DM2.9400, peaking at
DM2.9398.
The D-Mark also suffered a sharp decline against the yen, finishing at
Y80.5255. The German currency's only comfort was in trading against the
dollar, where it ended at DM1.6510, only a touch weaker than its previous
close of DM1.6505. Dealers said this was partly because the US currency had
itself weakened so much against the yen yesterday. But big interest rate
differentials between Germany and the US would have made it difficult in any
case for the dollar to make much progress. The dollar finished in New York
at DM1.6546.
Sterling was the main winner in London trading, up on both the dollar and
French franc. It finished in London at Dollars 1.7792, having opened at
Dollars 1.7715, and ended at FFr9.9075, up from the previous close of
FFr9.8825. The pound moved up to fourth from bottom in the ERM grid,
overtaking the French franc once again. It ended in New York at Dollars
1.7765.
Traders now feel that the next big barrier for sterling to cross is Dollars
1.78, its high in the immediate aftermath of the Conservatives' general
election victory in April. If it reaches DM2.95 in the next few days, it
will also cross its current central rate in the ERM, increasing speculation
that Britain will put sterling in the narrow band of the ERM.
The other big action yesterday came in yen trading, as the Japanese currency
gained from comments made at the weekend's G7 meeting. The G7 communique
said foreign exchange markets had been generally stable in recent months,
but added that the decline of the yen was not contributing to the adjustment
process.
The yen rose against most currencies. It closed against the dollar at
Y133.10 (after starting at Y134.55) and in New York ended at Y133.01.
Against sterling, it finished in London at Y236.75, having closed previously
at Y238.50.

FT  28 APR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture (Farmer's Viewpoint):
Agriculture's shrinking wage-packet - UK farming incomes have been nearly
halved in the past ten years
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID RICHARDSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FARMERS' INCOMES in the UK fell by 6 per cent last year. But when the value
of their own and their families' labour are allowed for their businesses
earned 14 per cent less than in 1990. It was the continuation of a trend
that, indexing 1985 as 100, saw farming incomes slide in real terms from 170
in the early 1980s to 87 in 1991.
These stark facts were revealed in Farm Incomes in the UK; 1992, published
by the Ministry of Agriculture last week. The document also showed that
while agriculture accounted for 2.1 per cent of UK employment, as it had for
the previous three years (having employed 2.6 per cent of the country's
workforce in the early 1980s), the industry's share of the gross domestic
product had declined to 1.3 per cent from 2.1 ten years ago.
Behind those depressing averages, however, the report indicated that
although the incomes of dairy and intensive livestock farmers fell last year
those of cereal and cropping farms increased although not, it was conceded,
in real terms.
So it would be reasonable to suppose that farmers in the area with the
greatest concentration of cereals and other crops, East Anglia, would be
feeling relatively buoyant, given their 'rising' incomes. After all, as Farm
Incomes in the UK points out, agriculture contributes more to the local
economy (4.6 per cent of East Anglias's GDP) than it does in any other
region of the UK, including Northern Ireland.
Little sign of buoyancy was revealed, however, by survey of East Anglian
farmers conducted recently by land agents Bidwells and the co-operative
Eastern Counties Farmers. The purpose of the survey, say its organisers, was
to establish the level of confidence among farmers; to explore their
concerns about the future and the options they face. Encompassing 140,000
hectares (340,000 acres) and 738 farmers the survey is claimed to have been
the biggest of its kind ever conducted in East Anglia.
The fundamental question on farmers' hopes for the next few years resulted
in more than two-thirds of respondents saying that they saw no immediate
signs of improvement in their businesses. Asked to compare this opinion with
how they felt a year ago almost three-quarters said they were less
optimistic about 1992 than they had been about 1991.
Interestingly Bidwells conducted a similar survey at the same time among
commercial property occupiers. The response in that sector was that 60 per
cent were more optimistic than they had been a year previously.
Questioned on what they thought of profitability prospects for the next five
years more than two-thirds of the East Anglian farmers believed that 1993
would be worse than 1992. Some apparently thought that there might be some
improvement after that but most predicted 'a plateau of agony' for the
foreseeable future.
In response to such a prospect almost half of those questioned said they
planned significant changes in their businesses during the coming year.
Neary a quarter said they would reduce manpower; most said they had done so
already.
Nearly a third proposed some form of diversification away from straight
farming and food production and said that they hoped to generate additional
non-farming income. One in 20 planned to seek paid employment away from the
farm.
Only one in nine of the farmers surveyed said they planned to purchase any
machinery this year. Moreover some respondents expressed their concern for
machinery dealers and the agricultural supply trade in general which is, if
anything, suffering more than agriculture itself as farmers are forced to
cut back on much-needed purchases. One farmer is quoted as commenting:
'Things may be bad on the farming side but will there be any of the supply
industry left to support it in five years' time?'
In the face of such adverse trading conditions very large numbers of farmers
said they contemplated retirement within five years. No less than 56 per
cent of those over 65 said they meant to get out of the industry soon. That
may not seem too surprising to non-farmers but in an industry where people
have normally carried on until they dropped it represents a significant
change.
Even more significant was the fact that 33 per cent of the farmers between
the ages of 51 and 65 were also thinking of retiring within five years while
3 per cent between 35 and 50 and 3.4 per cent of those under 35 were
considering getting out of farming.
However, amid all the pessimism 18.5 per cent of the farmers surveyed said
they were more optimistic than they had been a year ago, and one in six said
that they hoped to increase the acreage they farmed during the coming year.
Clearly these are the people who regard other farmers' problems as their
opportunity to expand. They presumably mean to run any additional land they
can get with their existing manpower and machinery thereby reducing unit
costs. That way they believe they can improve efficiency and stay ahead of
the commodity price cuts forecast as part of CAP reform.
Furthermore nearly half of those wishing to acquire more land said they
would prefer to purchase it rather than take it on any form of partnership,
contract, or tenancy agreement.
Farmers sitting on land with no encumberances (such as a mortgage) which has
been in their family for a few generations can still consider such purchases
and the average cost of the land they farm can still look cheap - if they do
not compare the returns from recent purchases with those from other
investments.
But farmers have never been good at that and the sharp decline in the price
of land over the last few years gives them the chance to expand at prices
lower than they could have believed possible 10 years ago.
For there is one other highly significant set of statistics which beggar all
attempts to make accurate summaries of the overall state of British
agriculture. It too appears among the tables in Farm Incomes in the UK and
it is this: 1 per cent of all UK farmers have no external liabilities at all
and 32 per cent do not have an overdraft.
How the viability of such people can ever sensibly be compared with that of
many of the others whose borrowing and interest charges dominate their
accounts is beyond me. But at least it explains why some answer opinion
polls differently to others.

FT  28 APR 92 / Government Bonds: German rally leads European markets higher
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON and PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPEAN government bond markets overcame fresh political uncertainty to
closer higher yesterday, with a rally in German bonds leading other markets
higher.
German government bonds fell in the morning session following the surprise
resignation of Mr Hans-Dietrich Genscher, the foreign minister.
The June bund futures contract on Liffe, the London exchange, fell to 87.05
in early trading, having opened at 87.13. But the contract rose to 87.46 in
late afternoon trading. Volume was an active 65,000 contracts. Traders said
the price movement was exaggerated as investors moved to cover short
positions taken on last week when the market fell heavily.
Yesterday, the State of Baden Wuertemberg released preliminary cost of
living data for the month to mid-April which showed a 0.3 per cent rise in
prices on the month. At this level, inflation is running at a year-on-year
rate of 4.3 per cent, from 4.8 per cent in March.
Data from other states is expected this week, with preliminary data for the
whole of western Germany expected by the end of the week. Analysts are
anticipating an annual rate of 4.6 per cent.
Mr Otmar Issing, Bundesbank board member, said that inflation was likely to
decline sharply below 4 per cent by late summer. Lower inflation may allow
the monetary authorities to cut interest rates and Mr Issing's statement
improved sentiment.
THE ITALIAN government bond market followed a similar pattern, opening lower
following the resignation of Mr Francesco Cossiga, the president, on
Saturday, but closing higher on the day assisted by the strength of other
European markets.
The benchmark 10-year fixed rate government bond closed at 98.16 from 98.095
on Friday. The June 10-year bond futures contract on Liffe closed at 98.39,
up from an opening level of 98.13.
The market was weaker in the morning session as the market reacted to the
resignation of Mr Cossiga, which leaves Italy without a president or prime
minister following inconclusive parliamentary elections earlier this month.
However, traders said that the resignation could speed the process of
political reform in Italy, with positive implications for bond prices in the
longer term.
UK GOVERNMENT bonds rallied strongly yesterday, with the strength of the
pound on the foreign exchange markets and the buoyancy of German bond prices
leading gilts higher.
The benchmark 9 per cent gilt maturing 2011 was up  1/2 a point on the day,
closing at 99 27/32 for a yield of 9.01 per cent. The June gilt futures
contract on Liffe opened at 98.09 but climbed to 98.29 by late afternoon.
Volume was around the average, at 23,000 contracts.
Analysts said dealing in longer-dated gilts was dominated by investors and
market-makers adjusting positions before Wednesday's auction of Pounds 2.5bn
8 3/4 per cent gilts maturing 2017.
The very long-dated stock is likely to appeal primarily to domestic UK
investors, since overseas institutions are not active buyers of bonds of
more than 10-years' maturity. Hence the auction will be a crucial test of UK
institutions' appetite for gilts.
US government securities fell in quiet trading yesterday as the market
awaited the announcement of the Treasury's quarterly refunding programme and
a variety of economic data, all of which are due out later this week.
In late trading the benchmark 30-year bond was down  5/8 at 100 1/16 ,
yielding 8.112 per cent. The two-year note was also lower, down  3/16 at 99
29/32 , yielding 5.408 per cent.
Trading throughout the day was subdued, with dealers and investors reluctant
to get involved before they heard details of the refunding. Analysts expect
the Treasury to announce its intention to sell about Dollars 36bn of
three-year, 10-year and 30-year securities.
Just as important is the release of various economic figures scheduled for
later this week. The first data will be today's announcement of first
quarter gross domestic product and March new home sales.
JAPANESE government bonds traded lower overnight in Tokyo with the market
overshadowed by fears about oversupply of fixed-interest paper and concern
for the broader health of the financial system.
The benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond issue No 129 closed on a
yield of 5.665 per cent, from 5.625 per cent on Friday.
Traders said that dealing was dominated by professional intermediaries, with
few investors participating before public holidays which begin later this
week. Trading volume on the benchmark bond was a thin Y366bn, compared with
Y600-Y700bn on more active days.
Interest centred on the communique issued by ministers from the G7
countries. The statement said that this year's yen weakness had not helped
to right global trade imbalances. However, while international governments
may favour a stronger yen, there is no sign of central bank intervention to
support the currency.

FT  28 APR 92 / International Equity Issues: GM share issue to be made with
cut-price fees
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GENERAL Motors' proposed Dollars 2bn share sale, the largest
non-privatisation offering of shares launched internationally, will be
carried out for cut-price fees - although the company is still expected to
pay more than Dollars 50m to bankers around the world.
Although the fee arrangements have yet to be formally agreed, Morgan
Stanley, the US investment bank leading the transaction, is understood to
have indicated to other banks that they can expect to receive 2.5 per cent
of the proceeds for their involvement.
The indicated fee level falls below the 3 per cent level which banks
generally regard as rock-bottom for such deals. The extra discount reflects
the size of the transaction, and a belief that banks involved in
underwriting the sale around the world will be motivated more by the amount
of fees they will receive than the actual percentage.
Further details also emerged yesterday of the international portion of the
share sale, which is the first to be structured from the US as a series of
separate tranches tied to different regions around the world. Morgan Stanley
will co-ordinate the 50m-share sale, and will also take a leading role in
each separate tranche.
It will be joined in the US, where 35m shares have been earmarked for sale,
by First Boston, Lehman Brothers and Merrill Lynch.
Daiwa and Nomura will jointly lead the sale of 4.5m shares in the Far East,
with Cazenove and Warburg responsible for a similar tranche in the UK.
Co-leaders on the final instalment of 6m shares, to be sold in continental
Europe, Canada and elsewhere around the world, will be Deutsche Bank and UBS
Philips &amp; Drew.
The 30 per cent of shares earmarked for sale internationally exceeds the
typical 10-20 per cent international tranche on US share issues.
The larger international portion, and the decision to split it into separate
tranches, reflects GM's desire to focus more on non-US investors. An
international roadshow, beginning in the Far East late next week and moving
to Europe the week after, will take its senior management around the world
in the build-up to the sale, expected to be complet-ed around the middle of
May.
The size of international tranches seldom reflects the final outcome of
share issues, though. To generate a higher profile for their deals
internationally and to raise their profile in league tables, US investment
banks are known in the past to have announced large international tranches
to share offers which have subsequently been sold almost entirely in the US.
GM's share sale is far more internationally targeted than equity and
equity-linked issues recently from the two other large Detroit car makers,
Ford and Chrysler. Last autumn, Ford targeted 10 per cent of a Dollars 750m
convertible preference issue (later raised to Dollars 2bn) at international
investors, while Chrysler sold only 5m shares in its 35m-share, Dollars 350m
issue to foreign investors.
GM's shares lost ground yesterday, trading at Dollars 38 3/4 , down around
Dollars 1 from Friday and Dollars 3 3/4 below the price before the issue was
announced.
GM, which is expected to produce its first quarter earnings today, yesterday
released the results for its three non-automotive subsidiaries.
GM Hughes Electronics earned Dollars 181.4m in the quarter, up from Dollars
151.2m a year ago, but was helped by a Dollars 22m gain on the settlement of
a patent infringement lawsuit. Electronic Data Systems, the information
technology business, made Dollars 133.1m, up from a restated Dollars 106.3m
in 1991. General Motors Acceptance, the group's financing arm, reported net
income of Dollars 354m, up Dollars 48m, after excluding a non-recurring 1991
adjust-ment.
Wall Street is expecting the group as a whole to make a loss, although the
company has been signalling to analysts that the figures will be much better
than the Dollars 1.1bn of red ink recorded in the first quarter of last
year.

WHEN Mr Julian Ogilvie Thompson, chairman of De Beers, delivers his annual
statement today, he will be seeking to strike an optimistic note about the
diamond market, while not laying himself open to unsustainable predictions.
Last year Mr Ogilvie Thompson forecast that the Central Selling Organisation
(CSO) - the De Beers' organisation which markets about 80 per cent of the
world's uncut diamond production - was confident of sustaining sales. In the
event, CSO sales for 1991 were 6 per cent down on 1990 at Dollars 4.17bn.
Caution is thus likely to be the watchword in today's statement. Diamonds,
like few other businesses, thrive on euphoria and confidence. Fear and
pessimism are the enemies of the diamond trade, so Mr Ogilvie Thompson will
be doing his best to make an optimistic reading of the tea-leaves.
It will not be easy. The US which, like Japan, accounts for about a third of
sales, has been a weak market in recent years. Had it not been for
prosperity in Japan, CSO sales would have been much lower. However, analysts
report that the Japanese diamond sales have now slowed markedly in 1992,
partly as a result of the precarious state of the Japanese stock market.
News from the first three 1992 sights - the term for the rough diamond
auctions, which occur 10 times a year - is not good. Mr Richard Stuart,
analyst with Martin, believes sales are cumulatively about 30 per cent down
on the same period in 1991.
He predicts sales for the first half of the year will be 25-28 per cent down
on 1991 and expects CSO sales for the year to drop to about Dollars 3.65bn
from Dollars 3.93bn in 1991, this being predicated on an increase of about
25 per cent in second-half sales compared to 1991.
De Beers is playing its traditional role in a recessionary climate, acting
as a shock-absorber in the pipeline from producer to final buyer. The CSO
attempts to bring stability to the market by adjusting supplies to the
diamond cutters to meet demand, while maintaining purchases from producers
in terms of contractual commitments. The impact of this policy can be seen
in the level of diamond stocks held by the CSO, which have risen by nearly
50 per cent in the past three years.
The ratio of stocks to CSO sales reached a high of 136 per cent in 1982,
which was the worst period for De Beers since 1929. It then dropped to 48
per cent in 1988, only to climb again to 77 per cent at the end of 1991, or
97 per cent on some estimates if account is taken of Russian stocks held as
loan collateral.
Analysts point out that are few parallels between the current mild recession
in the market and the dark days of the early 1980s.
Then a deflationary period in the world economy caused vast stocks of
diamonds, which had been bought as an inflation hedge, to be deposited on
the market. De Beers, as a result, lost a degree of control over the supply
of diamonds into the pipeline below the CSO.
Today there are at least two important differences: there is no large
overhang of diamonds, held by non-CSO parties, and De Beers has improved its
control over the pipeline. It has, for example, detailed information about
the state of indebtedness of the cutters.
The 'delicious dilemma' for De Beers, as one analyst puts it, is that its
control of the market has never been better - it is when times are good that
producers get greedy and think of leaving the CSO - but the market is weak.
While De Beers' stabilising role is good for the market, it is not so good,
in the short term, for shareholders. The price of stability is higher stocks
and paying for this involves a drop in interest receipts. Thus De Beers'
interest income dropped from Dollars 378m in 1989 to Dollars 282m in 1990
and Dollars 209m in 1991.
De Beers is also the swing producer in the industry and thus more likely to
cut its own production in recessionary times than are, say, the Russians.
This will be the likely consequence of the coming on stream this year of De
Beers' new Venetia mine in the Northern Transvaal. Venetia's production will
probably displace that of other more marginal group producers.
The vulnerable state of the market at present makes a CSO rough diamond
price rise unlikely. The last was 5.5 per cent in March 1990. In 1981 a
small price increase caused a very sharp drop in sales - over 40 per cent by
value - and De Beers will not want to repeat that.
The longer-term picture must be giving Mr Ogilvie Thompson food for thought.
De Beers profited handsomely from the heady consumer days of the middle and
late 1980s. The question now is: how large is the sustainable market? Can
similar growth be expected again, or has the market matured?

<TEXT>
BERLINER Bank yesterday announced strong profits, a higher dividend and
plans for a capital increase.
Earnings rose sharply by 37.5 per cent last year to DM56.4m (Dollars 34.3m)
as the bank expanded strongly in east Berlin and eastern Germany.
The dividend is raised from 10 to 12 per cent. Mr Wolfgang Steinriede, board
spokesman, said the increase was a 'first step' towards attaining the level
of other leading German banks.
For the first three months of 1992 pre-tax profits rose 69 per cent to
DM90m. Mr Steinriede said the earnings outlook for the remainder of the year
was 'very promising'.
The bank plans shortly to raise fresh capital of at least DM500m in two
stages to cope with the expansion of business.
Berliner Bank was still interested in merging with Landesbank Berlin, the
former Sparkasse of Berlin, said Mr Steinriede. But the City of Berlin,
which controls 56 per cent of Berliner Bank, had yet to give its approval.
Some analysts feel that the increase in capital could be interpreted as
meaning the bank was now less eager to acquire Landesbank.
Berliner Bank benefited from the reduction in turnover tax and investment
benefits granted to Berlin companies by the German government.
In the past, export-oriented Berlin companies first delivered their goods to
an affiliate in west Germany in order to get VAT reductions for the company
and for the buyer. Only then were the products exported to third countries
with the financing usually arranged by west German banks. This business was
now being picked up directly in Berlin.
Berliner Bank, which merged last year with Berliner Stadtbank in east
Berlin, has 28 branches in east Berlin and eastern Germany where it has
gained 120,000 new customers.
It is looking further east and has established links with Wielkopolski Bank,
one of the largest private Polish banks located in Poznan, western Poland.

LEIF HOEGH, one of Norway's biggest shipowners, has improved 1992 first
quarter net profit by NKr40m to NKr135m and forecasts profits of NKr350m
(Dollars 20.9m) for the year as a whole.
The shipowner also announced that it is restructuring its tanker business by
establishing an independent tanker management company, Bona Shipping. Bona,
based in Oslo, is expected to be operational from the fourth quarter.
Leif Hoegh said that it is seeking partners and investors for tanker
activities. 'An independent international shipowning company, incorporating
Bona Shipping, will be established as these activities expand,' it said.
The company added it would eventually reduce its equity ownership stake in
such a company to less than 50 per cent.
Bona will take over the management of Leif Hoegh's existing fleet of 10
Panmax ships as well as two double-hulled Aframax tankers contracted for
delivery in 1993 and 1994.
The move would leave Leif Hoegh with a 25-strong fleet comprising liquefied
natural gas (LNG) ships, car carriers, container/bulk ships and liner
vessels.
In the 1992 first quarter operating profit dipped to NKr90m from NKr100m.
Freight income fell to NKr551m from NKr707m.

<TEXT>
BOEING yesterday reported a 43 per cent increase in first-quarter net
earnings to Dollars 441m from Dollars 309m in the same period last year.
Sales in the first quarter totalled Dollars 7.97bn, compared with Dollars
6.1bn in the first quarter of 1991. Earnings per share were Dollars 1.29,
against 90 cents. Return on sales was 5.5 per cent, slightly higher than
last year's 5.1 per cent.
The solid first-quarter performance reflected higher commercial aircraft
deliveries and a profit from company's defence and space business, which
lost money in the first quarter of last year.
Mr Frank Shrontz, chairman, said he expected sales and earnings in the
second half to be lower than in the first half because of fewer deliveries
of 747 jumbos and reduced production of 737 narrow-body aircraft from 21 to
14 a month in the second half.
He told the company's annual shareholders meeting that group sales this year
were expected to be slightly higher at Dollars 29.5bn compared with Dollars
29.3bn last year.
Although Boeing continued to face a difficult short-term industry
environment as a result of the financial problems of many airlines, it
continues to have a strong backlog of orders, totalling Dollars 95.8bn at
the end of last month.
Orders in the first quarter totalled 124 aircraft compared with 91 last
year. Demand for narrow-body aircraft with less than 150 seats was sluggish
but demand for wide bodies remained buoyant.
The company expects to see a gradual recovey in civil aviation this year but
no significant recovery in new orders until later next year. To adapt to the
current weak market conditions, Boeing plans to reduce its 104,000-strong
workforce in the Seattle area this year by about 8,000.
The company is also facing heavy research and development expenditure
largely to finance the development of its new 777 wide-body aircraft and
other commercial aircraft projects. Spending was expected to peak this year
at about Dollars 1.8m and then continue in the Dollars 1.4bn to Dollars
1.6bn range for several more years.
The company is studying the possible development of a very large aircraft
seating 600 to 800 passengers. This could involve a stretched version of the
747 or a completely new aircraft.
McDonnell Douglas, Boeing's US competitor, is expected to unveil soon
details of its plan to develop a 400 to 600-seat, four-engined jumbo
aircraft to challenge Boeing's dominance in the very large airliner market.
The European Airbus consortium also has similar plans.
Boeing took on about Dollars 1bn in new debts last year, but has retained a
debt-equity ratio of just 15 per cent.

QANTAS Airways, Australia's government-owned international carrier,
yesterday said it was considering bidding for a significant stake in
Australian Airlines, the domestic carrier which is to be privatised next
year.
Mr John Ward, chief executive, said Qantas would file an expression of
interest with the government's airline sales task force on Thursday, the
deadline for indicative offers.
However, Mr Ward said Qantas had not finally decided to bid for Australian,
and indicated the airline also planned to discuss a possible operating
agreement with Ansett Australia, the domestic carrier jointly owned by TNT
and News Corporation.
He said Qantas's preference was for a significant holding in Australian, but
it would be unable to judge whether to bid for a controlling stake until the
next stage of the sale, when the government would discuss detailed options
with bidders.
Qantas had been barred from discussions with Australian, Ansett and other
airlines since an information memorandum on Australian Airlines was
circulated by the government shortly before Christmas.
However, the government announced in February that a ban on
cross-shareholdings between Qantas and the domestic airlines would be lifted
as part of a proposed second stage of deregulation in the Australian
aviation market.

BANCO Popular, the Spanish retail bank, posted a 30 per cent rise in
first-quarter net profits at Pta14.1bn (Dollars 134.7m), largely because of
the partial sale of its subsidiary in France.
The disposal of 50 per cent of the Paris-based Banco Popular Comercial to
the Banco Comercial Portugues brought the Spanish institution Pta1.6bn in
extraordinary profits during the period.
Banco Popular's net profit for the first quarter from the day-to-day
financial business stood at Pta12.5bn, a 15.5 per cent increase on the first
quarter of 1991.

FT  28 APR 92 / International Company News: Rand Mines falls sharply
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE WEAK gold price and higher operating costs combined to cut net profits
by 71 per cent for the four gold mines in the Rand Mines group during the
March quarter.
After-tax profit dropped to R7.3m (Dollars 2.54m) from R25m the previous
quarter. The results testify to how vulnerable marginal gold producers are
to small variations in the cost of mining, or the price of gold.
Total ore milled, average yield and gold production, at 11.6 tonnes, was
virtually unchanged from the previous quarter.
However, total costs rose by nearly 5 per cent to R370m while revenues were
lower because the average gold price received dropped 2.3 per cent to
R32,817 per kg. Only the Blyvooruitzicht mine made a working profit from its
underground operations.
The other mines enjoyed relief from their surface operations, but Harmony is
near the end of its surface reserves and the reserves at ERPM and Durban
Deep are very low grade.
The main cause of the fall in group profits was the performance of Harmony,
by far the largest of the group's mines, and the largest marginal producer
in the industry.
Its net profit declined to R6m from R18.3m, in spite of increasing
underground gold production.

SHARPLY higher film and consumer products earnings helped boost
second-quarter net profits by 29 per cent to Dollars 164m at Walt Disney,
the movie-to-theme parks group.
The company's revenues in the fiscal quarter to end-March were 15 per cent
higher at Dollars 1.66bn, while earnings per share stood at 31 cents,
against 24 cents a year before.
Mr Michael Eisner, chairman, said earnings were helped by the strength of
animated film and television products and related character merchandise. The
record US box office proceeds of Beauty and the Beast, the animated feature,
were especially helpful in the three-month period.
Operating income for the film division jumped by 85 per cent to Dollars
85.4m in the quarter, on revenues up by 5 per cent to Dollars 641m. The
consumer products division achieved a 33 per cent rise in operating income,
to Dollars 73.1m. Revenues were 55 per cent higher at Dollars 240m.
The theme parks and resorts division improved from its depressed level of a
year ago, at the height of the Gulf war. Operating profits were Dollars
139.1m, up by 6 per cent. Revenues increased by 15 per cent to Dollars
774.1m.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR EDWARD Finkelstein, chairman and chief executive of RH Macy, yesterday
said he was stepping down from the helm of the company he had steered
through a Dollars 3.6bn buy-out in 1986 and more recently into the
bankruptcy courts.
Yesterday's announcement follows growing speculation that outside directors
of the New York-based department store chain are taking control of the
board.
Mr Finkelstein, 67, had been regarded as something of a retailing wizard
through most of his 43-year career with Macy, before the company's troubles
became apparent in late 1988. He masterminded the 1986 management-led
leveraged buy-out, which was extremely successful. But he ran into trouble
in 1988 after a bidding war for Federated Department Stores left Macy with
Federated's California divisions and an additional Dollars 1.4bn of debt.
Macy struggled for years under its heavy debt burden, estimated at around
Dollars 3.7bn, and cash-flow was further depleted by the impact of recession
in the US and weak sales during the important Christmas season.
The company filed for protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of the US
bankruptcy code in January.
'I believe it is best for the organisation to focus on the future, instead
of the past,' said Mr Finkelstein, 'and that this is an appropriate time to
turn over the reins to my able colleagues.'
Mr Myron Ullman, 45, and Mr Mark Handler, 59, have been named co-chairmen
and co-chief executives. Mr Handler has been with Macy since 1958; Mr Ullman
joined the company in 1988. Mr Finkelstein will remain as a consultant.

FT  28 APR 92 / International Company News: IBM holds talks with clone maker
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE and LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INTERNATIONAL Business Machines, the world's largest computer manufacturer,
is in talks with Northgate Computer Systems. The talks may lead to IBM
taking a stake in the small personal computer manufacturer and to IBM
offering Northgate's 'clone' computers as a lower price alternative to its
own PC products.
Although no firm agreement has yet been reached the talks appear to be the
latest move by IBM to bolster its shrinking share of the world PC market.
The move follows IBM's agreement to develop advanced PCs with Apple
Computers, its arch rival. IBM is seeking deals with 'clone' manufacturers,
whose low-priced copies of IBM's designs cost IBM much of its PC market
dominance.
Clones are functionally and sometimes physically almost indistinguishable
from IBM's own designs. But because clone makers have lower fixed costs and
are prepared to accept much slimmer profit margins, their products sell for
lower prices.
With PC prices declining precipitously, IBM is looking for ways to compete
directly with priced machines, while at the same time maintaining the
premium brand appeal of its own Personal Systems products. IBM sells a clone
in south-east Asia through a joint venture company formed last year with
Hong Leong Corporation of Singapore.
In Europe, IBM is expected to offer PC clones built by an Asian manufacturer
through a newly-formed subsidiary that will focus on the low end of the PC
market.
An investment by IBM in Northgate could represent an opportunity for IBM to
offer lower priced products in the US.
Northgate, based in Minnesota, manufactures a complete line of
high-performance, low-cost clones, including notebook computers, desktop
machines and tower configurations.
Northgate's sales grew from Dollars 32m in 1988 to Dollars 203m in 1990, but
its attempts to expand sales organisation led to losses of Dollars 6.9m in
1990.
Since then the company has retrenched, reporting sales of Dollars 167m and
profits of Dollars 2.7m in 1991.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
COMPAQ Computer's first-quarter earnings plunged as the personal computer
manufacturer struggled to respond to rapidly declining prices and fierce
competition.
In addition, the company said it expected second and third-quarter earnings
to be below those of the first quarter.
Separately, Compaq announced it was to withdraw from the Ace Initiative, an
industry group it co-founded with Digital Equipment and Microsoft a year ago
to establish a new hardware and software standard for advanced personal
computers.
Compaq's first-quarter net income was Dollars 45m, or 53 cents a share, a 60
per cent decline from Dollars 114m, or Dollars 1.26, in the same period last
year. Revenues were Dollars 783m, down 19 per cent from Dollars 971m in the
first quarter of 1991.
The stock closed down Dollars 3 1/4 at Dollars 23 5/8 .
Compaq blamed its earnings decline on the extraordinary drop in personal
computer prices recently.
'Our financial results for the remainder of the year will continue to be
influenced by aggressive pricing and increased expenses due to an ambitious
advertising schedule, the introduction of new products late in second and
third quarters, and expansion of our distribution,' said Mr Eckhard
Pfeiffer, president and chief executive.
Compaq will launch a new range of lower priced desktop and portable personal
computers in June.
The company was 'unlikely to see the positive impact of our plans on
earnings before fourth quarter', Mr Pfeiffer warned.
Compaq's withdrawal from Ace is widely seen as the final blow in a series
that has significantly weakened the group's ability to establish a new
standard for personal computers based upon Mips Computer's Risc
microprocessor.
Explaining Compaq's decision to withdraw, Mr Pfeiffer said the company had
put 'on hold' its plans to launch products based upon a 'reduced instruction
set computing' (Risc) architecture this year, and instead would continue to
focus on developing machines built on Intel microprocessors.
Earlier this month Digital Equipment and Microsoft, two other key members of
Ace, announced a new alliance focused upon Digital's new 'alpha'
microprocessor.
Mips Computer, which developed the Risc microprocessor, last month was
acquired by Silicon Graphics, a workstation manufacturer.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DOW Corning, the 50-50 joint venture between Dow Chemical and Corning that
is the world's biggest manufacturer of silicone breast implants, yesterday
reported a 15.6 per cent decline in first-quarter earnings, reflecting
charges related to the implants.
The Michigan-based company, which last month said it would withdraw from the
silicone implant business, had net income of Dollars 36.3m on sales of
Dollars 484m, against Dollars 43m on sales of Dollars 452m in the first
quarter of the previous year.
In the latest quarter, the company had Dollars 24m of expenses related to
breast implants, which Dow Corning said 'contributed largely to the
reduction in profits'.
A change in accounting standards contributed Dollars 16.4m towards Dow
Corning's earnings in the latest quarter.
Earlier this month the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) sharply
restricted the use of silicone gel breast implants after an advisory panel
concluded that the devices had not been proved to be safe.
Mr Edward Steinhoff, chief financial officer, said the company does not
expect the breast implant issue to continue to affect profits at the same
rate.
Mr Steinhoff said the company's first-quarter sales parallelled the gradual
economic upturn in the US.
'Other major economies are slowing, however, but our good geographic balance
is helping Dow Corning maintain steady revenue growth,' he said.
Mr Steinhoff said sales growth in the US had been led by general silicone
activities.
'While the economic picture in Europe is gloomy now, we are well-poised to
take advantage of that area's longer-term prospects for growth with a
Dollars 300m expansion to our facilities in Barry, Wales,' Mr Steinhoff
added.

THE Canadian government for the time being will not offer any financial
assistance to Olympia &amp; York, the debt-burdened property developer.
The political risk of bailing out the wealthy Reichmann family, which owns
O&amp;Y, and the success so far in containing the fall-out from O&amp;Y's troubles
have led the government to defer taking a decision on a loan guarantee
requested by O&amp;Y and its lenders.
The guarantee is required to facilitate the sale-and-leaseback of the
36-storey Exchange Tower building in Toronto. O&amp;Y needs funds from the deal
to retire a commercial paper programme secured by the building.
A senior government official said yesterday that Ottawa would 'hang back and
watch for a bit'. The cabinet has yet to consider any proposal to support
O&amp;Y.
The government's hesitancy reflects public resistance, including in many
business quarters, to the use of public funds to prop up O&amp;Y. The Globe &amp;
Mail newspaper said in a weekend editorial that there was 'no public policy
interest in shielding the Reichmanns, their banks or the banks' shareholders
from the consequences of their actions'.
An executive with one of the country's largest property brokers said many
agents would welcome any weakening of the grip that O&amp;Y and another large
developer, Cadillac Fairview, have on the downtown Toronto office market.
The government had considered helping O&amp;Y, which is world's biggest property
developer, when it appeared O&amp;Y's troubles might destabilise the banking
system and currency markets. However, the chief executives of O&amp;Y's two
biggest creditors, Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce and Royal Bank of
Canada, have said that write-offs of their portions of O&amp;Y's USDollars 12bn
debt would have only a limited impact on their earnings.
Disgruntled holders of unpaid commercial paper remain a potential threat to
O&amp;Y's stability. Under the trust indenture of the Exchange Tower commercial
paper programme, the trustee is obliged to declare O&amp;Y in default if more
than 25 per cent of holders ask it to do so.
Royal Trust, the trustee for the programme, said it would act 'in the best
interests of our note-holders'. The trust company is reported to have set up
a special committee to consider the delicate fiduciary issues raised by
O&amp;Y's delay in redeeming the paper.
Mr Donald Wright, president of Merrill Lynch Canada, one of seven securities
dealers that made the market in O&amp;Y commercial paper, said he still expected
'a happy outcome' on the commercial paper issue.
In keeping with their obligation to create a secondary market, several
securities firms, including Merrill Lynch, still hold inventories of
Exchange Tower paper.
Mr Wright noted that O&amp;Y had scrupulously repaid, with accrued interest,
another commercial paper programme on which redemptions were delayed by its
liquidity crisis last month.

FT  28 APR 92 / UK Company News: Food retailers' property 'overvalued'
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The big food retailers are overvaluing their property portfolios and should
adopt more prudent accounting policies by depreciating freehold and long
leasehold land and buildings acquired since 1987, a stockbroker's report
suggests.
Such a change would have a drastic impact on projected earnings per share
for the year to spring 1993, reducing Tesco's by 21 per cent, J Sainsbury's
by 15 per cent and Argyll Group's by 11 per cent, according to estimates by
Credit Lyonnais Laing.
CLL said it was previously acceptable for food retailers not to depreciate
because inflation offset decreases in their underlying value. But the
carrying value of their recently-acquired assets is now uncomfortably high
given the current low inflation.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
SERIF COWELLS, the USM-quoted printing, publishing and leisure group,
tumbled from profits of Pounds 1.34m to losses of Pounds 2.21m pre-tax in
1991, described by the company as 'a traumatic year of change'.
The final dividend is passed. Last time there was a final of 0.5p for a
total of 2p.
Sales declined sharply to Pounds 34.4m (Pounds 62m), mostly because of the
loss in 1990 of the licences to distribute Trivial Pursuit and Nintendo. On
top of that, 'the depressed economic conditions severely affected market
demand and significantly reduced margins in all group companies', according
to Mr John Pryke, chief executive.
Group operating losses emerged at Pounds 724,000 (profits Pounds 3.2m).
Other income rose to Pounds 307,000 (Pounds 222,000), interest charges were
sharply down at Pounds 748,000 (Pounds 2.08m) and there was a Pounds 1.04m
exceptional charge relating to the reorganisation of continuing operations.
To cut gearing, the company undertook a programme of disposals - an
extraordinary charge of Pounds 3.18m (Pounds 44,000) related to this, and in
the year borrowings were reduced by Pounds 1.7m. Gearing is currently about
30 per cent: at the year-end it was 65 per cent. Losses per share worked
through at 10.1p (earnings of 3.5p).

FT  28 APR 92 / The Lex Column: Blenheim Group
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
After yesterday's 7 per cent jump in Blenheim Group shares, the exhibition
group's market value has risen almost a hundred-fold since its Pounds 5.8m
flotation in late 1986. Over the same period, the shares have outperformed
the market by a rather less startling five times.
Given that Blenheim has been conspicuously successful during the recession -
interim pre-tax profits rose by more than half - it seems churlish to ask
whether it is in danger of running out of steam. But it is not obviously
geared to economic recovery, so the question is perhaps more relevant than
at past moments in its history.
The group has been strengthening management of what it rightly describes as
its brands - the big annual trade fairs, such as Batimat in France, which
have proved their reliability in a downturn. It claims there is demand for
extra space which should feed straight through to profits. In addition, its
strategy is to increase margins by cutting spending on promotions and to
export successful exhibitions to new markets. There looks to be plenty of
room for growth.
Thus, the answer is that although its momentum probably will slow, Blenheim
is unlikely to grind to a halt. Other media companies, particularly pure
publishers, stand to gain more immediately from recovery, so the comparison
may test the rating; Blenheim's shares are on a current year multiple of
more than 20, which looks fully valued for now.

FT  28 APR 92 / The Lex Column: AB Foods
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
AB Foods' interim results were very much in character. The dour struggle of
the milling and baking business contrasts with the vigorous energy of
British Sugar. The sharp decline in the return from the remnants of ABF's
cash mountain was a reminder that it correctly timed that acquisition. That
said, the chairman's downbeat description of the outlook left the market
rightly unimpressed and the shares languishing on a prospective multiple of
9.
Given that ABF stands somewhere between Ranks Hovis McDougall on the one
hand and Tate &amp; Lyle on the other, it is instructive to look at how the
three have performed relative to the market in recent years. The cyclical
downturn in milling and baking began in 1988-89, so one can legitimately go
back a little further than that. Over the last five years, whereas ABF has
almost exactly matched the market, RHM has fallen by 41 per cent in relative
terms, while Tate &amp; Lyle has outperformed by nearly 80 per cent.
The only ground for optimism is that ABF is becoming more like Tate. British
Sugar is on course to make about Pounds 140m out of a group pre-tax profit
of Pounds 325m this year. Perhaps more importantly, it is the focus of ABF's
strategic thinking; talk of an investment in C&amp;H Sugar in the US, if
realised, should mean another Pounds 100m or so of cash will be spent by the
end of the summer. The rest of ABF is correspondingly uninspiring, but at
least investors know what they are buying.

FT  28 APR 92 / The Lex Column: Rank
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It would be ungracious not to give Rank some credit for its decision to sell
its UK hotels. The company's leisure interests were never going to generate
enough cash to reduce gearing much below its present 64 per cent. The hotel
sales may allow it to lop as much as Pounds 300m off a net debt which now
exceeds Pounds 1bn, creating leeway to develop the mass market activities
that Rank understands best. That said, the market is probably right to be
suspicious about how soon the sales will be completed. Though Rank's price
rose by nearly 2 per cent yesterday, volume was a mere 708,000 shares.
The provincial hotel market, into which Rank is trying to sell 1,146 rooms,
is awash with unsold properties. Business in London, where it has put over
2,000 rooms on the market, has still not recovered to 1990 levels. Rank may
thus have to work hard to extract satisfactory prices. Given that the hotels
collectively made little more than Pounds 15m last year, each disposal
should enhance earnings. The mistake would be to expect much effect before
next year.
Arguably, too, Rank is selling at the wrong point in the cycle. Its hotels
offer recovery scope in a portfolio that has otherwise proved relatively
recession-proof. One cannot assume that any recovery in big-ticket consumer
spending prompted by the Tory election victory will do much for bingo or
Butlin's. Maybe growth will come from the US, where Universal Studios could
be contributing handsomely to earnings later in the decade. That, however,
remains a rather distant prospect.

FT  28 APR 92 / The Lex Column: Deflating German hopes
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It is tempting to conclude after yesterday that the German government's grip
on the economy is faltering. Two senior ministers resigned; the Kohl
administration came under heavy attack from other industrial countries for
its lax fiscal policy and excessive interest rates; the country was hit by a
wave of strikes from public sector workers. That would normally be enough to
inject a note of nervousness into financial markets, but - after an initial
wobble - the DAX finished only marginally lower and the 10-year government
bond future actually rose.
Granted, the resignation of Mr Hans-Dietrich Genscher after 18 years as
foreign minister has little relevance for the markets. Nor should the
strikes have any relevance, as long as they are over quickly: indeed, they
reveal a government so far determined to avoid fanning the inflationary fire
through high wage settlements.
Yet the markets may be drawing too much solace from optimistic comments on
inflation made by both Chancellor Kohl and Dr Otmar Issing of the
Bundesbank. It will take more than that to open the door to lower interest
rates.
The Bundesbank council would be reluctant to ease while money supply is
growing at nearly 10 per cent, especially since the economy still has some
life left. Whatever the daily news distractions, the basic danger is still
the same - that the present policy mix will lead to prolonged stagflation.
That would be positive neither for German financial markets nor for those of
its European partners. A little more action and fewer promises on the budget
deficit would be more convincing.

FT  28 APR 92 / Markets rise on hopes for recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH and JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STERLING, leading UK shares and government gilt-edged securities all rose
yesterday, on the back of strong hopes that a UK recovery will begin later
this year.
While the pound gained 1 1/4 pfennigs against a weaker D-Mark to close in
London at DM2.9375, the FT-SE 100 index of leading shares climbed 15.2
points to close at 2,658.2.
Gilts, which are bonds sold to finance UK government borrowing, also rose by
up to half a point as investors took a favourable view of growth prospects.
Sterling's position in the European exchange rate mechanism (ERM) against
the D-Mark was helped by news of mounting political and economic problems in
Germany. Worried international investors switched money out of D-Marks into
other currencies, including sterling, the Japanese yen and the French franc.
The pound's rapid gain against the German currency since the UK general
election has taken it to within nearly 1 pfennig of its central ERM rate of
DM2.95.
In the past two weeks, it has leapfrogged the Danish krone, the French franc
and the Italian lira in the ERM. Against the dollar yesterday, the pound
closed in London at Dollars 1.7795, up three quarters of a cent, and in New
York at Dollars 1.7765. In late trading in New York the pound was at
DM2.9381.

FT  28 APR 92 / Chancellor warns of tight public expenditure round
</HEADLINE>

IMPROVED growth prospects in the US and Germany mean that 'growth should
become fully established' in the UK this year, Mr Norman Lamont, the
chancellor, said yesterday.
But in his first press conference since the election, he warned that a
'tight public expenditure round' would be necessary this autumn, and the
government would have to keep 'a very wary eye on the fiscal position over
the medium term'.
Mr Lamont said a firm line on public spending would be needed because the
recession in the UK had lasted longer than expected, swelling the public
sector deficit to a forecast Pounds 28bn in the current financial year.
He told fellow finance ministers at yesterday's meeting in Washington of the
International Monetary Fund's policy-making interim committee that Britain's
underlying fiscal position was strong. The lurch into deficit was 'primarily
due to the effects of the automatic stabilisers', particularly on the
revenue side.
The chancellor said he expected Britain's fiscal position 'to improve very
considerably' as the UK economy recovered.
He defended his refusal to stimulate the economy 'whether through
devaluation, premature cuts in interest rates or fiscal expansion'. It would
have been 'wholly irresponsible' to engineer 'a boom which would inevitably
have been temporary and unsustainable'. Mr Lamont said he expected the end
of pre-election uncertainty and improved world economic conditions would
unleash pent-up consumer demand in Britain, helping recovery.
He was given some encouragement in his view by relatively upbeat assessments
of conditions in the US and Germany from Mr Nicholas Brady, the US Treasury
secretary, and Mr Theo Waigel, the German finance minister.
'We are seeing clear signs of economic recovery now in the United States,'
Mr Brady said.
In Sunday's meeting of ministers from the Group of Seven leading industrial
countries, Mr Waigel reported that gross domestic product in western Germany
increased by 1 per cent in the first quarter of this year compared with the
final three months of 1991. He forecast that growth in Germany as a whole
would be 'a good 2 per cent' this year.
However, Mr Brady was concerned that growth prospects were less favourable
for the US's industrialised trading partners. 'On an aggregate basis, the
major industrial countries are experiencing their third straight year of
inadequate growth,' he said.
Sub-standard growth not only hurt the inhabitants of the industrialised
countries, by cutting income and raising unemployment, but - looking to
developments in eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union - 'it also
seriously jeopardises what is probably a unique opportunity in our lifetimes
to build an integrated, prosperous global market economy', Mr Brady said.
He stressed that a primary objective of the US and the European members of
the G7 was to secure a commitment to faster growth through fiscal stimulus
and easier monetary policy in Japan.
But these calls were rebuffed by Mr Tsutomu Hata, the finance minister of
Japan, and Mr Yasushi Mieno, the bank of Japan's hardline governor.
In trying to achieve the goal of a global market economy, the industrialised
countries at this year's spring meetings of the IMF and the World Bank have
focused on the need for stricter fiscal policies. This is seen as the way of
securing lower interest rates and stronger world growth.
It emerged yesterday that Mr Lamont had led the questioning of Germany's
high fiscal deficits in Sunday's meeting of G7 finance ministers. The
ministers spent more than two hours arguing with Japan over the need to
incorporate into the communique a thinly veiled call for Japan to increase
public spending to increase demand.

FT  28 APR 92 / Genscher quits after 18 years: Foreign minister's departure
may create fresh strains in Kohl coalition

<TEXT>
MR HANS-DIETRICH Genscher, Germany's foreign minister for the past 18 years,
yesterday stunned the political establishment in Bonn by announcing his
decision to resign next month.
His move marks the end of an era in German foreign policy, and is likely to
cause new strains within the coalition government of Chancellor Helmut Kohl.
The government is already struggling with severe budget constraints, facing
the danger of a prolonged public service strike, and slipping in popularity
in the polls.
Mr Genscher's successor was named as Mrs Irmgard Schwaetzer, 50, formerly
the state secretary for European affairs, and most recently construction
minister. Her automatic appointment - she comes from the same minority Free
Democratic Party (FDP) as Mr Genscher - was criticised by the Christian
Social Union (CSU), the Bavarian-based sister party of Mr Kohl's Christian
Democrats (CDU).
The chancellor was obviously anxious to avoid any major cabinet reshuffle at
a sensitive time. He faced the simultaneous embarrassment of a second
resignation, that of Mrs Gerda Hasselfeldt, the health minister. Her closest
adviser is being investigated on suspicion of espionage. She was instantly
replaced by a CSU colleague.
Only four weeks ago the government was faced by the sudden resignation of Mr
Gerhard Stoltenberg, the defence minister, and the most senior CDU Minister
after Mr Kohl, in a row over arms deliveries to Turkey.
In spite of the upheaval, the chancellor insisted yesterday that the
resignations would not weaken his government. He paid warm tribute to the
extraordinary service of Mr Genscher, saying his decision to go was entirely
personal, and understandable in the light of his long service - 23 years in
all as a cabinet minister.
'In these 23 years, German unity became possible, and also the breakthrough
on the way to political union in Europe,' Mr Kohl said. 'In all of that,
Hans-Dietrich Genscher played a decisive part. With his own inimitable
personal handwriting, he has written a significant part in the history book
of our country and our people.'
European colleagues also paid tribute to Mr Genscher. Mr Douglas Hurd, UK
foreign secretary, said he was saddened at his resignation, calling him an
outstanding leader who helped unify Germany. A word with Mr Genscher by
telephone or at international meetings 'has always been worth 100 official
telegrams,' he said.
European Commission president Jacques Delors said Mr Genscher would be
sorely missed.
In a television interview last night, Mr Genscher confirmed he was not a
candidate to succeed Mr Richard Weizsacker as German president. He has also
made clear that he is not interested in succeeding Mr Delors at the European
Commission.
In his letter of resignation - requesting to leave office on May 17, the
18th anniversary of his appointment as foreign minister - Mr Genscher gave
no clear indication of the reasons for his departure. He said only that the
step was 'right and necessary.'
Aged 65, it is known that he has suffered from heart problems in recent
years, including at least one serious heart attack, although his wife
Barbara said health was not a factor in his decision to quit.
Since unification, however, Mr Genscher has appeared to have less influence
on German policy, with Chancellor Kohl taking the lead in relations with
other EC member states and the US.
Mr Genscher told colleagues in the FDP executive he wished to devote more
time to the course of German unification. Coming from the east German town
of Halle - he fled to the west in 1952 - he has always sought to promote the
needs of the former East Germany in the West.
Mrs Schwaetzer will face a huge challenge filling the international role of
Mr Genscher, although she is a tough negotiator, and well experienced in EC
affairs.
According to members of the FDP, she agreed to withdraw her name from the
contest for future leadership of the party - to succeed Mr Otto Lambsdorff -
in return for her party nomination to succeed Mr Genscher.
Mr Kohl made it clear yesterday that he regarded the Foreign Ministry as the
preserve of the FDP for the life of the current government. But it seems
less likely, after the resignation of Mr Genscher, that the minority party
will be able to keep it in a future coalition.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Is the top management team of Mercury Asset Management, London's biggest and
most successful quoted fund manager, starting to disintegrate as the younger
generation jostle for power?
Generally, there is nothing unusual in the fund management industry about
executives coming and going. Indeed it is a healthy sign. But what is
amazing about Mercury is that it has grown into such a huge organisation -
it has over Pounds 40bn under management and a massive share of the pension
fund business - without any loss of its top personnel. Mercury is well
beyond a size where economies of scale make sense any longer.
However, there are signs of change. Just before Christmas James Dawnay, the
unit trust boss, quit to join Martin Currie, and now Richard Bernays, one of
Mercury's vice chairmen, is off to try to revitalise Hill Samuel's big, but
sleepy, fund management business.
Mercury is maintaining a stiff upper lip. But chairman Peter Stormonth
Darling, who has dominated the group for more than a decade, is getting to
an age when he should be thinking of retirement. With Bernays out of the
way, the two front-runners are David Price, an admin wizard, and Stephen
Zimmerman, the investment guru. David Price would make a natural successor
but insiders say that the choice is too close to call.

Ex-communists in St Petersburg, still nursing their wounds over the decision
to rename Leningrad, will see as another provocation the decision to allow
Grand Duke Vladimir Kirillovich, the pretender to the Russian throne
abolished in 1917, to be buried in Peter and Paul fortress alongside his
ancestors. The request, made by Leoda, the widow of Vladimir, an emigre who
spoke poor Russian and set foot in Russia for the first time last year, was
granted by vice-mayor Vyacheslav Scherbkov yesterday.
Ordinary people are likely to see this as somewhat strange since the duke,
who died in Miami last week, was part of an extinct dynasty. They will also
be amazed at the amount of rubble which the city authorities will have to
remove from the fortress; the Bolsheviks had poured concrete over what was
once a special burial place for the grand dukes, but separate from the
central cathedral where Peter the Great and other tsars are buried.

It is hard to quibble with the new management team being put in place at
British Aerospace. Richard Lapthorne, the new finance director, is not as
well known as his mentor - Courtaulds' Sir Christopher Hogg - but he is well
regarded. Not only is he well liked in the City, but he knows all about
demerging businesses which could come in handy if BAe ever decides to unload
its excess baggage.
That said, Lapthorne suffers the same sort of problem as does John Cahill,
BAe's new chairman. Both come from successful businesses and it is hard to
know how much of their apparent success was due to them, and how much to the
supporting actors.
Meanwhile, the front-runner for that other BAe hot-seat - the task of
remaking BAe's public image - is Hugh Colver, currently chief of public
relations at BAe's main customer, the Ministry of Defence. Apparently he
told senior colleagues of his plans to leave the MoD on election day 'so
that there would be no misunderstanding' about his motives for going.

FT  28 APR 92 / Observer: Genscher's last laugh
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It has been a tempestuous few months for Irmgard Schwaetzer, Germany's next
foreign minister in succession to her erstwhile mentor, Hans-Dietrich
Genscher.
In that time she changed her name (from Adam-Schwaetzer), remarried (to TV
presenter Udo Philipp), celebrated her 50th birthday (on 5 April), and now
becomes the first woman in the history of the Federal Republic to hold such
an elevated ministerial office.
A pharmacist by training, and an economic free marketeer by conviction, she
has inevitably been called the 'German Maggie Thatcher', although she is
condemned by the size of her party never to have a real crack at the
chancellorship. Nor did she quite make it to the leadership of her party,
and now has apparently agreed not to try - in exchange for the foreign
ministry.
She hails from Munster in Westfalia - like her great rival in the new
generation of Free Democrats, Jurgen Mollemann, the economics minister, who
is putting a brave face on not getting the job. Always a protegee of
Genscher's, she was for a long time his state secretary for European
affairs, well-regarded in Brussels for her capacity to negotiate through the
night after her boss had flown off to the next round of engagements.
As foreign minister, she must tread softly for some time to come - coping
both with the indelible Genscher stamp left on the foreign ministry, not to
mention a Chancellor increasingly calling the foreign policy shots himself.
The real question is whether she can hang on to the post after the 1994
elections if the coalition wins again; Volker Ruhe, ex-secretary-general of
the Christian Democrats, just appointed as defence minister, has always
wanted her job.
Indeed, the fact that Genscher has chosen to quit now, when Ruhe is
otherwise engaged, could be seen as a neat revenge by the wily old
campaigner.

the budget deficit threaten Germany

Clearly Mr Hans-Dietrich Genscher, Germany's seemingly immortal foreign
minister, thought it was a good moment to give an intimation of his
mortality.
His decision to resign next month, on the 18th anniversary of his
appointment, was designed to cause the minimum possible disruption to his
own political party, to Chancellor Helmut Kohl's coalition government, and
to German foreign policy in general.
There are no elections in the German political calendar for 18 months - an
extraordinary breathing space for that country. Two state elections have
just taken place, albeit with indications of voter fatigue and a disturbing
protest vote for the far right, against the main political parties.
As for foreign policy, Mr Genscher expressed his confidence that the
guidelines had been firmly set by his own fair hand. 'The commitment of our
foreign policy to Europe is irreversible,' he told his colleagues in the
presidium of the Free Democratic Party (FDP). 'We set our European
convictions against any new nationalism. We set the value of our
constitution and a policy of international responsibility against any power
politics. And we know that things cannot go well for long in western Europe
if things go badly in eastern Europe.'
He leaves behind a Germany committed on the one hand to European political
and monetary union, through the Maastricht Treaty, and on the other to
maximum openness towards eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union.
Whatever Mr Genscher may have thought, however, the timing of his departure
could scarcely look more disruptive from an international point of view.
His letter to Chancellor Kohl was published on the very day that Germany was
plunging into the first all-out public sector strike for 18 years; the
popularity of the coalition has suddenly slid to a new low; the finances of
the government are overstretched and the business community is miserable;
and the rest of the western industrialised world is banging on the table in
Washington and calling for Bonn to put its house in order for fear of a
worse international recession.
Not only that, but a second government minister - Mrs Gerda Hasselfeldt, the
minister of health - quit on the same day, apparently overwhelmed by the
cares of office, and tainted by a spy scandal affecting her closest adviser.
Yet Mr Kohl, like Mr Genscher, appears unperturbed. As far as he is
concerned, it is government as usual. He does not intend a serious cabinet
reshuffle, nor to change his budgetary plans, nor to improve his pay offer
to the public sector unions; and he is not going to tell the German
Bundesbank to change its interest rate policy.
Is he oblivious, and the cataclysm is about to engulf him? Or is he a wise
old statesman steering a steady course through a little choppy water?
There is no doubt that the departure of Mr Genscher removes a mine of
experience, a man who has known every leading statesman in east and west for
almost two decades, who has followed every turn of European Community
policy, and who has successfully related foreign policy to the German in the
street. The latest opinion poll in Der Spiegel magazine gave him a positive
rating of 77 per cent - more than any other active politician, and far more
than Mr Kohl himself, with 54 per cent.
The same poll shows the popularity of the coalition sliding - Mr Kohl's
Christian Democrats (CDU) are down to 37 per cent, although Mr Genscher's
FDP is steady on 10 per cent. Another poll yesterday by the Forsa institute,
a market research group, marked the CDU, and its Bavarian sister party, the
CSU, down to only 33 per cent, with the opposition Social Democrats moving
up to 41 per cent.
Against that background, the government cannot but suffer from the loss of
its most popular member. It also seems likely that the FDP will suffer, even
if Mr Genscher continues to play a role in internal affairs. The FDP has
survived as the kingmaker, the swing party between the Christian Democrats
and Social Democrats, largely thanks to the acute political instincts of the
foreign minister. The three party members who remain in the cabinet - Mrs
Irmgard Schwaetzer, his successor, Mr Jurgen Mollemann, the economics
minister, and Mr Klaus Kinkel, the justice minister - cannot match his
cunning.
And yet the departure of Mr Genscher is not all negative. Indeed many of
Germany's partners, and Mr Genscher's political rivals, not least in the
German foreign ministry, will see it as a positive relief.
A western diplomat in Bonn, asked last year whether German foreign policy
was becoming overbearing, remarked: 'It is not German policy which is
overbearing. It is Hans-Dietrich Genscher.'
Although Mr Genscher may believe he has left clear guidelines for the
conduct of German foreign policy, the country's search for a post-Cold War
identity has only just begun. Since unification, the foreign minister has
seemed increasingly out of touch with the real political power in Bonn,
which has resided in the Chancellor's office. Mr Kohl has been the key
policymaker on the European Community, and he is also the key figure in
relations with the US.
Thus Mr Kohl may have good reason to welcome the resignation, creating as it
does a useful vacuum in which a somewhat more sensitive foreign policy in
style can be drafted, if not fundamentally different in substance. With the
resignation just four weeks ago of Mr Gerhard Stoltenberg as defence
minister, it means that both key external relations jobs are now in the
hands of the new political generation.
What is more baffling is why the chancellor should be also so apparently
unperturbed on the economic front. For there he is boxed in with problems on
every side.
The public sector strike, however disruptive or short-lived it may prove, is
a symptom of something more profound: the unwillingness of the ordinary west
German worker daunting cost of unification.
At the same time, Mr Kohl's partners in the Group of Seven industrialised
nations, to whom he will play host at the Munich world economic summit in
July, insist that he is already trying to finance too much through
borrowing, forcing up German interest rates, and thus threatening the
recovery prospects of the rest of western Europe and the international
economy.
It is a moot point, and an acutely sensitive one. On the one hand it is
clear that the cost of capital transfers, both public and private, from west
to east, is causing a haemorrhage from the once resilient western economy,
without as yet showing any real sign of an increase in eastern productive
capacity. Total federal government transfers to the east for 1992 are
estimated by Germany's leading economic institutes at DM150bn (Pounds
51.5bn). But the large expenditure has so far failed 'to spark the expected
powerful, self-supporting recovery process'.
Mr Kohl and his finance minister, Mr Theo Waigel, are in a bind. On the one
hand they have promised to limit federal expenditure increases to 2.5 per
cent a year over the next four years. Yet expenditure on transfers to
eastern Germany is forecast to rise by 17 per cent in 1992 over 1991. That
means an overall budget growth rate of 5 per cent, which in turn implies
that federal spending in western Germany must actually fall by a real 4 per
cent this year to meet the 2.5 per cent target. The German government
rejects US calculations that its budget deficit amounts to as much as 6 per
cent of its GDP, insisting that even when borrowing for the railways and
telecommunications is included it will not exceed 4.5 per cent.
Mr Waigel has promised a budget austerity drive 'as hard as nails' in the
coming months. He says no new spending will be approved without
corresponding cuts elsewhere in the budget. But the real question is whether
a coalition government can agree on absolute spending cuts in the current
political climate. An attempt last year to cut subsidies by DM10bn failed,
although tinkering with tax allowances helped meet some of the bill.
The real question is how quickly the eastern German economy can pick up,
thus reducing the need for transfers to subsidise jobs, pay unemployment
benefit, and keep major loss-making employers in business. Although the
collapse of the eastern economy may have ended last year, this year's
forecast of 10 per cent growth is regarded by economists as more of a
technical correction than a real recovery.
If eastern Germany does not achieve self-sustaining growth in the next two
years, Mr Waigel will have to keep stepping up transfers - precisely the
danger which the other G7 governments fear.
Despite the large deficit, Mr Kohl has promised no cuts in social spending,
and no increase in taxes. And now he is facing a furious public sector
workforce striking to squeeze more from his empty purse.
It is not just the workers who have failed to understand the true cost of
unification. Local authorities in the public sector are proving equally
spendthrift, according to Mr Helmut Schlesinger, president of the
Bundesbank. He has accused them of pushing up their spending by no less than
9 per cent last year 'as if nothing had happened. Yet another
adventure-pool, yet another museum, yet another town-twinning partnership in
Scotland or Portugal, and yet more official tourism: all this is carrying on
regardless.'
The truth is that the full cost of unification has still not hit ordinary
Germans, and yet they are already up in arms at the expense. The drift of
voters to extreme rightwing parties, like the Republicans and the Deutsche
Volksunion, is a protest not only at rising immigration, but also at the
squeeze on their living standards. It should not be exaggerated (the
Republicans have pushed up their support from 2 to 5 per cent in the latest
polls), but nor can Chancellor Kohl afford to ignore it.
In his announcement yesterday of his resignation, Mr Genscher declared that
the very fact of his voluntary departure was proof of 'the good working
capacity of our democratic structures'. It showed the 'understanding of
democracy of those who carry responsibility in our highest offices of
state'.
Two weeks before, a very senior government official expressed a contrary
view. He quoted Sir Ralf Dahrendorf, once Germany's commissioner in
Brussels, now warden of St Anthony's College, Oxford, on the contrast
between British and German democracy. British democracy, he said, was strong
because it had shown it could survive times of economic depression as well
as economic growth. The question still hanging over German democracy, the
senior official said, was that it had yet to prove it could survive the bad
times as well as the good.

FT  28 APR 92 / Arts: Chinese artist who weathered the revolution
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM PACKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Wu Guanzhong is a figure more characteristic of the oriental than the
occidental cultures, an artist schooled in the ancient tradition of his
country yet avowedly modern in practice and intention. Whether or not he
reconciles the old with the new is another matter, but it is that polarity
that makes his work remarkable and intriguing. Indeed it presents the
dilemma with particular force, for the circumstances of his career are those
of China itself during the past 60 years, torn between the old ways and the
modern world, still unsure of where the commitment should lie.
He was born in 1919 in Jiangsu province. It was at the University to the
Academy of Art, Hangzhou, that he first became aware of modern western art,
in particular that of the impressionists, the post-impressionists and
fauves. But during the Sino-Japanese War, which broke out in 1937, the
school was merged with the Peking Academy.
Before the war the policy had been to expose students to foreign influence
and many of Wu's teachers had studied abroad in Europe and Japan. His turn
came in 1946 when the post-War government reintroduced the system and he was
one of three artists to win travelling scholarships to Europe. He spent
three years in Paris, returning in 1950 to teach at the Central Academy in
Peking. By this time, however, Socialist Realism was asserting itself as the
new orthodoxy and sole alternative to the traditional schools. As a teacher,
Wu's opportunities were inevitably constricted, but he was at least free to
carry on his own work more or less as he pleased.
With the Cultural Revolution of 1966, all that changed. Along with his
colleagues and students he was committed to hard labour in the countryside
and, for the three years from 1969, not allowed to paint at all. In 1972 his
situation eased somewhat when recalled to Peking, though the move was marked
by his readoption of the imagery and techniques of the Chinese ink and paper
tradition that he had been taught as a student.
Since 1976 and the Revolution's end, his artistic freedom has been
uninhibited, but, as this exhibition so clearly demonstrates, he has
continued for the most part with ink and paper, and remained consciously
much closer to the traditional preoccupations than he was before. In recent
years Wu has again travelled widely and his work has been shown in Japan,
Russia, America, India, Hong Kong and the Middle East, but not hitherto in
Europe. This show at the British Museum is a notable first.
To concentrate so much on the biography is neither to deny nor evade the
work itself, but very much to inform it in what is a special case. Here we
have the work of the 20 years since that return from internal exile, the oil
paintings and the works on paper, the topographical studies, the modest and
charming landscapes in the manner of later post-impressionism, shades of Van
Gogh, Matisse and Derain. Here too are the larger, freer, more consciously
ambitious works that teeter on the verge of figuration and yet remain
wonderfully descriptive and evocative, embracing at once abstraction,
modernism, tradition and the old calligraphy.
Wu is at his best when least self-consciously modern, indeed when least
concerned to demonstrate the western conventions. His work in the western
manner is competent enough but by no means exceptional. But as we move on to
the principal works on paper, dating mostly from the 1980s to, it would
seem, the day before yesterday, with their swirling floods of ink, their
nervous, active line and instinctive, decorative handling of the surface, we
come to something truly original and as visually joyful as anything seen
here in a long time.
The bright-eyed birds blink out from a Banyan Forest that is as free and
confident in its abstraction as a Jackson Pollock, though no less a forest
for that. Trees and Temple roofs peer over the great rockery or 'false
mountain' of the Lion Grove Garden, a calligraphic rock face as active as
anything of Mark Tobey. The exquisite Lace Bark Pine twists and writhes
before the Imperial Household at Peking, a tree that with its fellows, in
every year of the Qing dynasty, between 1644 and 1911, was given a salary of
hundreds of silver pieces.
This late and easy acceptance of meaning and particular association in the
work, steeped in the Buddhist tradition, is at the heart of the matter. For
Wu there is no longer anything of the western modernist critical opposition
between form and content. 'I love wistaria', he says, 'the hoary strength,
the gnarled crookedness, the creeping and the spreading of its sinews and
bones, and I love its noble bearing and charm . . . In the Lion Grove Garden
at Suzhou is the wistaria planted by the painter Wen Zhengmin (1470-1559)
and to this day the trunk and leaves conceal the sky . . .': and this of one
of the freest and most abstracted of the paintings of the 1990s.
Here, so it would seem, we have again an old and universal paradox. The
artist, no longer embattled, sees his former necessities fall away, the
public front to keep up, the principle to uphold. And that freedom he so
long defended is now not indulged as something quite distinct, so much as
naturally reconciled to the tradition. But that freedom is still there, even
so.

FT  28 APR 92 / Management (The Growing Business): How to put a value on a
share of the action / A look for the pointers to a company's real worth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Valuing the shares in a private company is a tricky matter. With no market
to put a value on the business, the sums depend on fine commercial
judgments, profit performance - past and future - and the calculation of
some rough and ready discounts. Equally importantly, it is a matter of
shrewd psychology.
Take the case of one family-owned business where the managing director and
majority shareholder was negotiating the sale of the company. He took the
view that his hard work had created the value in the business and, since he
had the largest shareholding, his shares, individually, were worth more than
those of the minority 'sleeping' shareholders.
An elderly aunt, who was a minority shareholder, objected to this valuation.
Tempers were already frayed when the aunt suddenly announced her intention
of bequeathing all her worldly goods to the local dogs' home. When her
nephew, a dog-hater, heard this, negotiations became even more difficult.
'Often it is not a question of making a formal calculation of value but of
dealing with psychology,' says Roy Nicholson, corporate finance partner at
accountants KPMG Peat Marwick.
But the question of how to value private company shares is not just the
stuff of family quarrels. Fewer than 3,000 of the UK's 1m companies have a
public stock market listing so valuing private businesses is of crucial
economic importance.
Even when strong personal animosities are not part of the calculation,
though, valuing shares in unlisted companies is more of an art than a
science. 'You can only give an opinion as to value,' comments Trevor
McDonagh, a partner at accountants Coopers &amp; Lybrand Deloitte. 'In the end,
every single factor used in arriving at a valuation is subjective.'
Value will depend on the shareholdings and personalities of the other
shareholders and the possible benefits a buyer could get from incorporating
the business into his own. 'You can't value a shareholding in the abstract;
it depends on who wants to buy it and why,' says McDonagh.
But amid all this uncertainty, there are pointers. The first place to turn
for guidance is the company's articles of association. These frequently set
down a rough outline for valuing shares, though long-established family
firms with strong patriarchal traditions may have deliberately avoided
enshrining any rights for minority shareholders.
The articles may adopt general terms such as 'fair market value' or they may
go into greater detail, insisting that there is 'no discount for minority
shareholdings' or 'no price less than attributable net assets'. Very
occasionally, they may require 'a multiple of (say) four times profits'.
'At one extreme, the articles may say something which is superficially
acceptable but of little value,' says Charles Ranson, a partner of London
solicitors, Hardwick &amp; Co. 'At the other, you may have something very
detailed. I am not sure that any of these approaches is particularly
satisfactory.'
Unlisted company shares will usually be valued at a large discount to their
quoted counterparts because they lack a convenient public market place.
Price will usually be based on earnings but if the company pays a dividend,
it may relate to dividend yield. A price/earnings calculation may also be
adjusted downwards to take account of a company with a very small asset base
or relatively low turnover.
If shareholders are unable to agree on a price, the articles will usually
stipulate that they must obtain an independent valuation, often from the
company's auditor. Some shareholders may doubt the independence of the
auditor, however and insist on an independent accountant doing the job.
The articles of most private businesses will contain a pre-emption clause
requiring any shares to be offered to other shareholders before being sold
to outsiders. Unless there is an obligation for the other shareholders to
take up all the shares being offered for sale, the vendor may be left with a
small and unsaleable minority.
This can create particular dangers for directors who have fallen out with
the rest of the board or who have been dismissed. They may find dismissal
triggers a 'bad leaver' clause which reduces the value of their shares. It
is particularly important for directors to study the articles of their
company when they are appointed to the board to see the conditions under
which they can be dismissed and the terms which would apply to the disposal
of any shares they acquire.
Directors should also take independent legal advice on the terms of their
service agreement, if they have one, and the terms of any shareholders'
agreement, says Christopher Southam, a partner in Bristol solicitors Veale
Wasbrough. 'If someone ceases to be a director, he may be automatically
deemed to have given notice to sell his shares,' Southam notes.
Valuing a 100 per cent holding is not always easy but it can prove
relatively simple, compared with the problems raised by minority stakes.
Unless the articles require a valuation to be on a pro rata basis, it is
normal for a minority stake to be valued at a discount.
A 25 per cent shareholding in a company which never pays dividends and which
is dominated by a strong-minded managing director usually has very little
value, says Peat's Roy Nicholson.
Shareholders are sometimes able to argue, successfully, that although the
business is incorporated, it is in effect 'a quasi-corporate partnership',
that the shareholders are really partners with an equal share in the
business. If this is so, then their minority holdings should not carry any
discount.
But a court is unlikely to be sympathetic to a shareholder who buys into a
company, knowing there are limits to the value of his shares because they
represent a minority stake, and then tries to argue he has been
disadvantaged.
Minority shareholders sometimes point to the price paid by a venture capital
company buying into the company as a guide to the value of their own shares,
says Trevor McDonagh. But they overlook the fact that the venture capitalist
is often buying into a new class of share, possibly with conversion rights,
and may also be getting a seat on the board.
A commercial arbitrator may appear to be doing all he can to reduce the
value of a shareholding; the taxman takes the opposite view. 'The
shareholder may be locked into an investment which brings in no income and
which is virtually unsaleable, but for tax purposes he has to pretend he can
sell them freely,' says David Bowes, a consultant with accountants Grant
Thornton. The taxman is also free to ignore any price formula set down in a
company's articles.
A father sold his son shares at Pounds 20 each - net asset value with no
discount for minorities as prescribed in the company's articles - but the
Inland Revenue insisted on taxing them at market value which it calculated
at Pounds 45 a share.
There is little that shareholders can do to escape the taxman's approach to
valuations but the share valuation issue is becoming slightly less opaque.
As more private companies establish share option schemes for executives and
employees, and as more shares change hands, so it becomes easier to
establish a true market value.

SHARE CERTIFICATE
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
What is your shareholding worth? Trigger points which will affect the
value of your shares in a private company.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
100%     of company: complete control
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
90%:     effectively complete control because minority shares can be
         compulsorily bought.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
75%:     enough to carry a special resolution or wind up the company
         but still could leave a difficult minority shareholder.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
50.1%:   effective control but still leaving exposure to difficult
         minority.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
50%:     a recipe for stalemate if the other shareholders can all agree,
         but valuable if other shareholders are on your side. And
         nevertheless still likely to be worth much less than 50.1%.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
49.9%:   likely to attract another big discount from 50%.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
25%:     practically worthless, particularly if no dividends are paid
         and majority shareholder(s) are ready to freeze the minority
         out. Not very attractive for an outside purchaser.

VIRGIN ATLANTIC Airways is to follow other intercontinental carriers by
offering three classes of travel.
The company launched its 'Mid Class' service yesterday for passengers who
have paid full price for economy tickets. They will have a separate cabin
and more legroom.
Until now, Virgin has sold seats only in economy class and upper class,
where prices were roughly comparable with business class on other airlines.
Fewer than 4 per cent of Virgin passengers pay the full transatlantic
economy one-way fare of between Pounds 334 and Pounds 404. Discounted
tickets can be as cheap as Pounds 99 but there are restrictions on travel
dates.
Virgin hopes Mid Class will push the proportion of full-fare passengers up
to 10 per cent.

FT  28 APR 92 / Pace of NHS reforms to stay
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PACE of change in the National Health Service will be maintained, Mrs
Virginia Bottomley, the health secretary, told nurses yesterday.
Mrs Bottomley, making her first speech as secretary of state, was addressing
the annual congress of the Royal College of Nursing.
She said she shared the view of many NHS staff that what the service needed
was a period of continuity and stability. However, dispelling nurses' hopes
that there might be a slowdown in the pace of reforms, she said: 'My job is
to see that the momentum of the reforms which my predecessors Ken Clarke and
William Waldegrave have set in place is maintained.'
In a wide-ranging speech Mrs Bottomley urged everyone in the NHS to work
together for the best health service possible.
She said: 'We may differ in approach or political views, but we share at
least two unequivocal commitments: commitment to the best health care
possible for our people and commitment to the NHS.'
Mrs Bottomley announced a review of mental health nursing, which will
examine the way psychiatric care is delivered. She also announced a review
of community nursing services and claimed that nursing and midwifery
research would be given a higher profile.
A report launched at the congress showed that more than 100 nurses had
complained about standards of patient care to a confidential 'whistle
blower' service.

FT  28 APR 92 / Differences surface at meeting on Ulster
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DIFFERENCES between the aspirations for Northern Ireland of the British
and Irish ministers surfaced publicly yesterday - pointing to possible
difficulties in the 'round table' talks that are about to start on the
political future of the province.
Ministers met in London and agreed a three-month gap in the regular
Anglo-Irish conferences, allowing cross-party talks to start in Belfast
tomorrow.
They expressed a 'strong hope' that the talks, which collapsed last July and
were revived ahead of the general election, would lead to 'a new beginning'
for Northern Ireland in its relations with the UK and Dublin.
Sir Patrick Mayhew, the new Northern Ireland secretary, and Mr David
Andrews, the Irish foreign affairs minister, put differing em-phasis on the
goals of the talks.
Sir Patrick said it had been agreed that Northern Ireland would remain part
of the UK as long as the majority of those living there wished it.
'Therefore the British government will rise from the (conference) table
still holding to that reaffirmation.'
He was also realistic in his hopes for the talks - suggesting that he might
be content if agreement was reached only on a devolved government.
Northern Ireland's population wanted politicians, he said, 'to produce some
kind of agreed accommodation that will represent an advance on circumstances
which exist in Northern Ireland at the moment'.
In contrast, Mr Andrews said Northern Ireland's constitutional position in
the UK was an issue 'that will have to be discussed in the talks'.
He pointed out that Unionists wanted to discuss the articles in the Irish
constitution that claim the territory of the north. 'If articles two and
three of the constitution of our country are up for discussion, is there any
reason why other constitutional positions are not up for discussion?' he
asked.
His comments might heighten Unionist suspicions about the Irish government's
motives. Mr David Trimble, Ulster Unionist MP for Upper Bann, accused Dublin
of 'a ploy to break down the talks'.
His comments are not irreconcilable with Sir Patrick's views. Mr Andrews did
not dispute that the 1985 Anglo-Irish Agreement says the province's
constitutional position depends on the will of its people.
The British and Irish governments announced a Pounds 66.5m upgrading of the
Belfast-Dublin railway, a frequent target of terrorist bombings. The
European Community will fund 75 per cent of the cost.

FT  28 APR 92 / Record damages award made to victim of RSI
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Goodhart
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A MACHINE operator at Vauxhall Motors in Luton who contracted repetitive
strain injury (RSI) and had to give up her job has been awarded a record
Pounds 59,617 in damages and loss of earnings by a judge at Luton County
Court.
Judge Farnworth found Vauxhall to have been negligent in not warning Mrs
Jane Inskip, 63, of the risks she faced from repetitive actions on
gear-shaving machines. Vauxhall denied liability and is appealing.
Mrs Inskip's union, the AEU, said the settlement might have implications for
the thousands of other RSI-related cases that may go to court.
Although higher settlements for RSI have been agreed out of court, Mrs
Inskip's case has set a record for a court settlement - Pounds 31,500 for
loss of earnings and Pounds 5,000 general damages. Miscellaneous damages and
interest pushed the figure to just under Pounds 60,000.
Mrs Inskip contracted D'Quervains tenosynovitis and osteo arthritis in 1984
after more than 10 years of loading and unloading machines, a repetitive
action involving turning, twisting and some force. She volunteered for
redundancy in 1986.
A recent case involving BT keyboard operators granted damages of Pounds
6,000 but a loss of earnings award has not yet been decided. In another case
nine workers represented by the GMB general union received Pounds 67,000
between them for loss of earnings.
Eight journalists with repetitive strain injury have now left the Financial
Times on terms that include lump-sum payments of at least one year's salary
from the company, a guarantee that sufferers who recover their health can
return to employment at the newspaper and ill-health pensions.
A ninth person, who is not in the pension scheme, is about to leave on terms
that will include benefits under a permanent health insurance policy. The
settlements do not deprive sufferers of their right to seek legal redress.

FT  28 APR 92 / Brighton cable TV opens today
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NYNEX, the New York and New England telephone company, will today open its
second cable television franchise in the UK - the south of England franchise
of Brighton and Hove.
Under its first franchise, the company has made cable available to 26,000
homes in Portsmouth and 5,200 of those are now subscribers.
Mr Nicholas Mearing-Smith, executive group director of Nynex Network
Services in the UK, said the company expected this year to take cable
networks past 30,000 homes and to spend Pounds 60m.
The large US telephone company wholly owns nine cable television franchise
operations covering 1.2m homes and is building integrated networks offering
both cable television and telephone services. 'We're serious and we're here
for the long term,' Mr Mearing-Smith said.
He believes that offering competitive telephone services to those of BT is
rapidly emerging as the most important part of the cable business.
The official opening of the Brighton franchise at Hove - the franchise
covers 160,000 homes - is a symbol of the progress being made by cable
television.
Mr Jon Davey, director of cable at the Independent Television Commission,
believes that Pounds 450m will be invested in UK cable networks this year to
add to the Pounds 1bn already committed to the industry.
At the beginning of this year, cable television was potentially available to
1.34m homes and 269,000 actually subscribed. For the first time, the average
subscription level passed the 20 per cent mark.
Mr Davey expects cable to be available to 2.2m homes by the end of this year
as network construction continues.
From a small base, there has also been a rapid growth in the number of
telephone lines sold by cable companies. At the beginning of last year there
were just over 2,000 lines in the UK. Now there are more than 30,000.
Although the industry has been dominated by north American interests, Mr
Davey believes there is an opportunity for UK investors to get involved.

FT  28 APR 92 / Crunch brings Lymeswold cheese to a sticky end
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GUY DE JONQUIERES, Consumer Industries Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LYMESWOLD, the soft natural cheese once billed as Britain's answer to the
likes of Brie and Camembert, has been consigned to the history books 10
years after it was launched to nationwide publicity.
Dairy Crest, the commercial arm of the Milk Marketing Board, which developed
Lymeswold at a cost of several million pounds, said yesterday that it
stopped making the cheese last week. The plant that produced it will close
next month with the loss of 38 jobs.
Dairy Crest is seeking a buyer for the plant, in Aston, Birmingham, but it
intends to retain the Lymeswold brand and the equipment to produce it.
The company said it had lost money for several years on the cheese, which
had been selling poorly.
When Dairy Crest introduced Lymeswold in 1982, it expected the cheese
eventually to capture a quarter of the UK market, then worth Pounds 800m a
year.
At first, consumer enthusiasm for the first new British cheese for 200 years
suggested the optimism was justified.
The launch received a big boost from Mr Peter Walker, then minister of
agriculture, who endorsed the cheese on television.
Viewers were also shown Bomba, Mr Walker's Old English sheepdog, tucking
into chunks of Lymeswold.
However, from then on, troubles set in. Unable to meet initial demand, Dairy
Crest released Lymeswold stocks before they were properly matured. Instead
of being soft and creamy, much of the early cheese on sale was hard and
chalky in the middle.
Dairy Crest responded by building the Aston plant and fitting it out with
special equipment imported from the Continent that could turn out 4,000 tons
of Lymeswold a year - several times the original capacity.
Soon after the plant came on stream, though, the Lymeswold market went into
inexorable decline and annual production never exceeded 2,000 tons a year.
A promotion campaign in France flopped, and after a re-launch of the product
failed in February, Dairy Crest decided to cut its losses.
The company declined to give recent sales figures, saying its marketing
staff 'would not want to confess to the low levels they had reached'.
However, according to market research company AGB, barely a third of UK
supermarkets stocked Lymeswold last year.
Mr Walker believes poor quality control was also to blame. 'Several times,
I've bought Lymeswold which should never have been on the supermarket
shelf,' he said yesterday. 'In recent times, there have been some rather
better German equivalents available.'
What Bomba, Mr Walker's sheepdog and Lymeswold's best-remembered fan, would
have made of it all will never be known. He died several years ago.

LONDON'S chamber of commerce is this week launching what it claims is the
first recent comprehensive guide aimed at potential foreign investors in the
capital.
The guide is a directory and promotional effort, necessitated, according to
the chamber, by the absence of a capital-wide local authority.
It surveys property, financial and labour markets and offers advice on
locations, services, transport and local government.
Ms Jacqui Ginnane, the chamber's chief economist, said: 'There has been a
steady decline in investment in London since the late 1980s and it is vital
that someone puts the case for London.'

FT  28 APR 92 / Recruits to accountancy fall to a 5-year low
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE NUMBER of students entering the accountancy profession fell to its
lowest level for five years last year, but the quality of those remaining
has continued to rise, according to statistics released by the Institute of
Chartered Accountants in England and Wales.
There were 6,391 students entering the profession in the year to July,
compared with 7,063 in the previous 12 months. Most still go to the largest
accountancy firms.
Mr Phil Armitage, director of education and training at the institute, said
he expected numbers to fall further.
The proportion of entrants with first-class or upper-second-class degrees
has risen from 45 per cent in 1985 to 55 per cent last year. Pass rates for
the PE1 professional exams averaged 81 per cent, and 90 per cent for PE2, of
which 57 per cent succeeded on their first attempt.
The median starting salary for a graduate in chartered accountancy in London
was Pounds 12,500 last year, and Pounds 9,500 elsewhere in the country.
Only 11 per cent of the intake is non-graduate. A fifth of the total
comprises graduates with relevant degrees, principally in accountancy. Other
common degrees for those entering the profession are business, science,
maths and engineering.
The proportion of women in the student intake rose by 0.1 per cent to 35.9
per cent. The proportion of individuals of non-European ethnic origin was 14
per cent. The median age at entry was 23, with 16 per cent joining after the
age of 25.
There were 15,730 trainee accountants in March, of whom 61 per cent were in
firms with more than 101 partners.

FOR at least one group of workers in British industry, the much-heralded
Leisure Age has finally arrived. Post Office maintenance engineers have
signed an historic deal that will enable them to enjoy a 22-hour working
week for a full week's money.
Naturally, the arrangement is not as idyllic for the workers as it might
initially sound. The 22 hours will be concentrated into the weekend,
starting at 3.30pm on Friday afternoon and ending at 7am on Monday morning.
The short hours will only be available for part of the year - probably April
to July - and will depend on the workloads rather than be guaranteed each
week.
Nevertheless, there must have been many employees in other sectors who read
of the deal yesterday and wondered when it would be their turn. If the price
of getting Monday to Friday off work is having to work two shifts of up to
12 hours over the weekend, then many would consider it worth paying.
So is the Post Office agreement the first glimmer of the dawn of the Leisure
Age? In the 1960s it was thought that labour-saving devices, the rapid
development of technology and medical advances prolonging life, would lead
to such an excess of leisure time that disposing of it would be the
question.
Employment continues to be unevenly distributed, with part of the population
suffering stress-related illnesses because of working too many hours, while
the unemployed endure the opposite situation. Unions have tended to
reinforce the pattern because of short-term fears that their members would
lose overtime payments.
According to government figures, more than 1m members of the 25m workforce
are 'double-jobbers' who hold down two jobs.
Surprisingly, even during the recession, substantial amounts of overtime
have continued to be worked: in February, seasonally adjusted figures showed
more than 10m hours of overtime being worked each week in manufacturing.
That compared with a peak of more than 16m hours in April 1979 and a low of
8.5m hours in March 1981 during the last recession. With the overtime,
British men continue to work longer hours than men anywhere else in the
European Community.
Some reductions have been made, principally after a campaign by engineering
unions that resulted in a cut from 39 hours to 37 hours for hundreds of
thousands of workers. A further push to a 35-hour week, common among
white-collar workers, is being delayed by unions until after the recession.
Rather than being driven by Leisure Age considerations, the Post Office deal
is an indication of quite another trend, according to Mr Alastair Hatchett
from Incomes Data Services, the pay and conditions research group. Employers
are, for reasons of economy, increasingly seeking to eliminate premium
payments for overtime and integrate unsocial hours working into the normal
working week.
There are a number of ways of doing so, including the move to annualised
hours which means employees contract to work a total number of hours over
the year, rather than on a week-by-week basis. That system is particularly
effective in allowing employers to deal with peaks and troughs in demand.
Manual workers at Hotpoint factories in north Wales work variable hours
depending on seasonal demand for domestic appliances.
The National Communications Union, which has negotiated the Post Office
22-hour deal, is only too aware of another way employers commonly cope with
those peaks and troughs - by hiring and firing staff in time with workloads.
The Post Office's own construction and maintenance operation now has to
tender for work with outside contractors. Many of those contractors will not
be burdened - as the Post Office itself has been - with having to pay
workers when there is little to do during the week, while also shelling out
for weekend overtime.
According to Mr Bill Fry, NCU president, the Post Office agreement is a
breakthrough that might provide an example of the way forward for unions and
employers in other sectors. 'We are endeavouring to protect people's jobs -
that's my retort when some members complain they could lose overtime,' he
says.

FT  28 APR 92 / Decisive backing for new Speaker
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A DECISIVE 134 majority (372-238) yesterday propelled Miss Betty Boothroyd,
62-year-old Labour MP for West Bromwich West, into the historic role of
first woman speaker of the House of Commons.
Boisterous good humour interlaced the tributes to Miss Boothroyd's personal
qualities, and her triumph led to a technically disorderly outbreak of
handclapping in which Mr John Major, the prime minister, and other members
of the cabinet joined.
In the first contested election for the Speakership since 1951, the
reputation for authoritative impartiality that Miss Boothroyd has
established while serving as a deputy speaker since 1987 was emphatically
underlined from the Conservative as well as the opposition benches.
Miss Boothroyd - formally Speaker-elect until her appointment is confirmed
by the Queen - was proposed by Mr John Biffen (C Shropshire North), a former
leader of the Commons.
Any doubts about the outcome of the vote were soon removed as 72
Conservative MPs joined with most occupants of the opposition benches in
heading for the lobby to ensure that Miss Boothroyd became the 155th Speaker
of the Commons.
Sir Edward Heath, who presided over the proceedings as father of the House,
confirmed the defeat of an amendment to secure the appointment as Speaker of
Mr Peter Brooke, the former Northern Ireland secretary and the MP for the
City of London and Westminster South.
Miss Boothroyd urged her colleagues to 'elect me for what I am and not for
what I was born'.
Mr Brooke, who secured the votes of most of his former Cabinet colleagues,
was among the first to congratulate the Madam Speaker-elect.
Miss Boothroyd, only the third Labour MP to be elected speaker and the only
former member of Labour's national executive to hold the post, will now
become a familiar figure on television. She recalled that her first
experience of the small screen was as member of the dancing Tiller girls.
After a mock display of reluctance to take up her new post - a reminder of
the times when the Commons was in conflict with the Crown and the Speaker's
term of office was frequently ended by summary execution - Miss Boothroyd
pledged herself to do all in her power to preserve and cherish the
traditions of the House of Commons.
Mr Major, who abstained in the division, led the congratulations to Miss
Boothroyd by stressing that she had been chosen by 'vote and acclaim'.
In becoming the first woman to assume the 'awesome responsiblity of speaker'
she had certainly made history.
Mr Neil Kinnock, the Labour leader, highlighted the mastery of procedure
shown by Miss Boothroyd when, on being installed in the Chair, she had
declined to call the prime minister to speak until the mace had been placed
in position by Sir Alan Urwick, the serjeant-at-arms.

FT  28 APR 92 / Women's pioneer may want to play safe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NOT ONLY is Miss Betty Boothroyd the first woman to be elected Speaker, she
has perhaps the most consistently backbench career of those who have made it
to the Speaker's chair - a destination that has usually been reached via the
cabinet.
To that extent she is as representative of the vast majority of MPs as her
sex makes her unrepresentative of MPs in general - women make up less than
10 per cent of the Commons.
Her election to the Speakership is likely to be her most significant break
with tradition for some time.
Conscious that her performance will have a significant impact on how women
are viewed in political life, she may well settle for being safe rather than
sorry, at least in the immediate future. It is certainly difficult to
imagine her treating the advice of the House of Commons clerks with the same
dismissiveness as that shown by Viscount Tonypandy, when he was Speaker.
Miss Boothroyd is cheerful and approachable, and those Tory critics who have
commented that she might lack the gravitas for the role may be surprised.
She herself has commented that: 'I have an inclination to be schoolmarmish
in the old-fashioned sense'.
MPs have been encouraged not just by the good humour and common sense she
has shown as a deputy Speaker for the past five years, but also for the way
in which her speech yesterday matched the occasion and reflected common
backbench experience. She gave a warm tribute to her predecessor, and
recalled sitting in the Speaker's chair through some of the Commons' duller
and drowsier moments as well as the historic occasions.
Mr John Biffen, her proposer yesterday, reminded MPs that she had
longstanding experience of the endless frustrations of a backbencher's life
and was a member of that 'fraternity in suffering'.
Miss Boothroyd said yesterday that she had never sought or expected one of
the great offices of government. Instead her career has encompassed a
succession of jobs in her party and the Westminster establishment, such as
have been held by many of her colleagues.
After a brief spell in the Labour whips' office from 1974-75, she spent more
time with the European Assembly. She was on the national executive committee
(NEC), Labour's ruling body, from early 1981, and in a few months was on the
organisation sub-committee and urging an NEC investigation into Militant.
Her stance as an outspoken rightwinger, combined with her 'communautaire'
views led one of her supporters yesterday to describe her as on the 'Roy
Jenkins wing of the party'.
At Westminster, she acquired some of the unsung posts that senior
backbenchers seem to gain almost by osmosis - chairing committees looking in
detail at legislation, and serving on the House of Commons Commission, which
takes some of the staffing and 'housekeeping' decisions at the Commons.
Earlier she had also followed some traditional backbench pursuits, including
serving on the all-party foreign affairs select committee from 1979-81 and,
in 1985, successfully harrying the government over a constituency interest
in the Housing Defect Act.
Her arrival at Westminster in a by-election for West Bromwich West in 1973
came only after a long and unsuccessful trudge round various elections and
by-elections, after a Labour party career that had begun with the Labour
league of youth when she was 16, and included years working as a secretary
at Transport House.
Any remaining sceptics at Westminster who doubt that years of political
service can demonstrate the skills needed in the Speakership may find
instead the proof in the remarkable degree of cross-party support she
generated, while organisers for the Tory backbenchers seemed unable to
agree.

FT  28 APR 92 / The new boys and girls settle in: Philip Stephens tries to
pick winners among the latest intake of MPs on their first day at
Westminster
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT was not hard to spot the new boys and girls as they milled around in the
lobby of the House of Commons at yesterday's opening of the new parliament.
Apart from fresh faces and brightly polished shoes, most of Westminster's
new MPs sported proudly the photographic security badges which older hands
have long since removed from their lapels.
'It's rather embarassing really, but I suppose they must be allowed to show
off for a week or so,' offered one long-serving Tory.
A colleague confessed that his grandchildren looked older than some of those
with whom he would now be sharing a place on the government backbenches.
Not all the newcomers displayed the awkwardness that comes with
unfamiliarity.
The more worldly-wise on the Conservative side were already busy arranging
'pairs' with their Labour counterparts under the system that allows matched
government and opposition MPs to escape many late-night votes.
Attending her first meeting of the parliamentary party, Ms Glenda Jackson,
newly installed in Hampstead and Highgate, showed none of the humility that
the Labour heirarchy expects of newcomers. To the chagrin of her 'seniors',
Ms Jackson arrived 10 minutes late and then calmly took a seat alongside the
party executive on the top table.
Her confidence was matched by the determination of some on the Conservative
side to make their first Commons television appearance during the election
of the Speaker.
Many ministers were forced to stand in the packed chamber, but Mr Gyles
Brandreth - who has swapped a career in light entertainment for the
constituency of Chester - managed somehow to find a place just behind the
prime minister.
In all, about a fifth of the 651 MPs who arrived to elect the Speaker of the
new House of Commons yesterday were newcomers - with 120 of them split
evenly between the Conservative and Labour benches.
Labour's new entrants displayed little of the deep gloom that has engulfed
the party leadership since April 9.
The party may have lost the election but the presence of their new
parliamentary recruits was testimony that they were individually victors.
Those looking for clues as to who has a role in the machinations after Mr
Neil Kinnock's resignation needed to glance no further than Mr Peter
Mandelson, the former campaigns director now installed in Hartlepool.
But it is on the Conservative side that the immediate interest of colleagues
and the media will focus. For the next while, the game will be to pick
'winners' destined for ministerial office and, perhaps 20 years hence, for
Downing Street.
Among those already on the inside track are a clutch of former Whitehall
advisers. Mr David Willetts, once of Mrs Margaret Thatcher's policy unit and
more recently director of research at the centre for policy studies, has an
obvious head start. So too do Mrs Judith Chaplin (Mr John Major's political
adviser) and Mr David Lidington (an adviser to Mr Douglas Hurd).
Mr Charles Hendry (formerly at social security), Mr Peter Luff (an aide at
one time to Lord Young) and Mr Alan Duncan (whose Westminster house was the
base for Mr John Major's leadership campaign) are among other putative
stars. On the right of the party, Mr John Whittingdale's loyal service as an
aide to Mrs Thatcher will stand him in good stead.
For those who want to climb on to the first rung of the ministerial ladder,
obedience to the party line will count for as much if not more than
intelligence.

FT  28 APR 92 / Labour race sees frantic campaigning
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY and ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FRESHMEN Labour MPs were yesterday at the centre of frantic campaigning in
the party's leadership race as a clarification of the election rules left
open the option of last minute switches in nominations that close today.
Campaign managers for Mr Bryan Gould insisted that they already had in the
bag the necessary 55 votes for their man to fight the odds-on favourite, Mr
John Smith, for the leadership in the contest that ends at a special party
conference on July 18.
The claim was not disputed by Mr Smith's supporters who have been anxious to
ensure that their candidate does not win the party's top job without a
challenge.
Mr Gould's team also said he had the pledges to contest the deputy
leadership while Mr John Prescott said he was 'quite confident' he would
join the battle when nominations close at 5.15pm today.
However, Mrs Margaret Beckett, the shadow chief secretary, is already seen
as the front runner for the deputy's post, provoking anger among the
outsiders on the left that the electoral machinery has been manipulated by
the party establishment.
Despite predictions, the true position remained far from clear after a
meeting of the parliamentary Labour party heard officials 'clarify' the
confusion that had left some convinced they could nominate second
preferences.
Most informed insiders predicted last night that Mr Smith and Mr Gould would
contest the leadership and Mr Gould, Mrs Beckett and Mr Prescott would fight
it out for the deputy's job. All other contestants would fail to qualify.
Eligibility for the final run-off for the leadership or deputy leadership
before an electoral college comprising MPs, trade unions and constituency
parties, requires nominations from 20 per cent of the parliamentary Labour
party.
At a crowded Commons meeting, Mr Larry Whitty, Labour's general secretary,
said that misunderstandings of a weekend ruling had led some MPs to believe
there was what amounted to a single transferable vote system, allowing their
second choices to be registered if their first option failed to clear the 55
nomination hurdle.
Walworth Road intended to make clear only that MPs could switch their votes
up to the final minute, even if they had already filed nomination papers.
That ruling, widely seen as a 'face-saving' move to paper over a blunder by
the party's director of organisation, Ms Joyce Gould, met fresh criticism
from Mr Ken Livingstone, the hard-left contender for the leadership.
Addressing yesterday's PLP meeting, Mr Neil Kinnock, the outgoing leader,
reminded the parliamentary party reinforced by 69 new MPs: 'As from today,
the mourning stops. The battle is now to fight the Tories.'

FT  28 APR 92 / Scots get investment warning
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CALLS for civil disobedience and industrial action in support of Scottish
constitutional change risk undermining inward investment, according to one
of Scotland's leading industrialists, James Buxton writes.
Mr Ron Garrick, chief executive of Weir Group, the Glasgow-based engineering
company, said that calls by senior figures in the Labour party at last
week's Scottish Trade Union Congress conference for civil disobedience and
industrial action were 'despicable, given the problems young people are
having in finding work'.
Mr Garrick was alluding to the heavily reported remarks of Mr Charles Gray,
Labour leader of Strathclyde regional council, who called for 'civil
disobedience within the law', as well as mass demonstrations and strikes,
and did not rule out 'civil disobedience outside the law', in pursuit of a
devolved Scottish parliament.
Mr Garrick said that if that happened, Scotland would become a graveyard for
investment.
Mr Gray cancelled a planned appearance at Sunday's rally in Glasgow of
Scotland United, a grouping campaigning for a referendum on Scotland's
constitutional future, on grounds of work and ill health.

FT  28 APR 92 / UK dominant in European PCs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UK and Ireland continued to dominate European personal computer
manufacturing last year and are now responsible for three out of every five
PCs built in Europe, according to Dataquest, the market research group.
Total PC sales last year exceeded 8.3m, worth Dollars 28bn (Pounds 15.8bn).
In its latest report, Dataquest estimates that of 5.4m PCs made in Europe
last year 4.2m were built by companies which bought semiconductors from
overseas for European PC production, and that 57 per cent of this production
took place in the UK and Ireland.
Including 'screwdriver' assembly, the UK alone represents nearly two-thirds
of total European PC manufacturing, led by companies such as Acorn in
Cambridge, IBM in Greenock, Research Machines in Oxford and Victor in High
Wycombe.
Italy is the largest volume manufacturer after the UK and Ireland, closely
followed by France and Germany. In spite of declining margins both Olivetti
and Apple also show strong growth in local production. Other volume assembly
plants that are emerging include Compaq, Elonex and Goldstar in the UK and
Vobis in Germany.
Dataquest forecasts that between last year and 1995 European PC
manufacturing will grow in line with the end-user PC market at a compound
growth rate of more than 11 per cent.
Other trends which are identified in the report include the growing role
played by 'no-name' companies in the European industry which account for 25
per cent of all PC production in Europe - equivalent to IBM's production -
the continuing move towards more powerful PCs, shorter product life cycles
and a further blurring of the differences between high-end desktop PCs and
UNIX workstations.
Dataquest also predicts that software developments will fuel PC memory chip
demand.
Mr Mike Williams, a Dataquest semiconductor research analyst, said '1991 was
clearly a tough year for personal computer dealerships in Europe. However
semiconductor memory chip sales soared by 32.5 per cent compared with an
overall unit PC market growth of 12 per cent'.
This growth in memory chip sales reflects the move towards memory-hungry
software and aggressive marketing tactics by PC suppliers.

FT  28 APR 92 / Brel workers may block control bid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN, Public Policy Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE 6,500 workers at Brel, the privatised UK rolling-stock maker, are
threatening to block attempts by Asea Brown Boveri to take control of the
loss-making company.
Union representatives say that members wish to retain the shares they were
given on privatisation, and would be prepared to increase their holdings if
the price was right.
The Swiss-Swedish company ABB owns 40 per cent of the shares and has agreed
to buy the 40 per cent stake held by Trafalgar House subject to clearance by
the European Commission.
Once clearance is given, ABB must bid for the remaining 20 per cent of
shares held by the Brel workers and management, at the share price paid to
Trafalgar House.
However, Mr John Darby, chairman of Brel, told shareholders at the Brel
annual meeting in Crewe on Saturday that he was recommending employees not
to sell at that price, which was based on a 'nominal' valuation.
Although the company had made a loss of Pounds 41.6m in 1991, new orders and
the recent restructuring of Brel had made him much more optimistic about the
company's future.
Since ABB has a policy of taking 100 per cent ownership of subsidiaries, a
higher offer is likely to be made for the shares held by employees and the
management team.
Mr John Heavey, secretary of the RMT union branch at the Derby carriage
works, said yesterday that employees at all Brel factories had told him that
they wished to retain their shares and even to buy more.
'We are not looking for a better price,' he said. 'Holding shares gives us a
say in the company, including the right to say our penn'orth at the annual
meeting.
'We are also opposed because we can see a brighter future in the company and
want a stake in it,' Mr Heavey added.
Each employee was given 43 of the Pounds 10 shares when Brel was privatised
in 1989. About 6 per cent of the shares are owned by past and present
employees, with another 14 per cent held by the management team.

FT  28 APR 92 / Mercedes reports sales up 35%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SALES of Mercedes cars in the UK since the April 9 general election have
been running about 35 per cent higher than a year ago, indicating that
recovery might be under way in the deeply depressed new-car market.
Mr Hans Tauscher, managing director of Mercedes-Benz (UK), warned yesterday
that recovery might be put at risk if two Brussels reports on new-car
prices, due to be published tomorrow, generate fresh uncertainty among UK
buyers about whether they are being charged excessively high prices compared
with other European Community markets.
Mercedes' increase in post-election sales contrasts sharply with the period
between the start of April and the general election, when sales were 10 per
cent below the already severely depressed levels of the same period a year
ago.
Mr Tauscher acknowledged that the extent of the upturn would have been
exaggerated as a result of potential buyers holding back in early April
until the result of the general election was known.
Speaking to a meeting of the Fleet Street Motoring Group, Mr Tauscher said
that the upturn was still 'a very positive sign'. He added: 'We all detect a
change of mood.'
Mr Tauscher said he was 'appalled' at the prospect of fresh dissension,
likely to be caused by tomorrow's publication of the two Brussels reports.
One, specifically on car prices, was produced for Sir Leon Brittan, the
European Community's competition commissioner. It shows substantial
country-by-country price differentials of up to 40 per cent. The other, for
Mr Martin Bangemann, the industry commissioner, also deals in part with car
prices but disagrees with the Brittan report on the causes.
Mr Tauscher said he was dismayed that the EC competition report appeared to
disagree with a previous one from the Monopolies and Mergers Commission,
'which after 20 months of investigation concluded . . . that the industry
had generally been pricing within EC parameters'. Under those guidelines,
prices should not vary by more than 12 per cent between member states for
long periods, and 18 per cent for shorter periods.
In spite of the potential short-term market setbacks, Mr Tauscher said he
believed that under a Conservative government the UK would enjoy sufficient
economic growth for the 'quality' car market - cars of over 2 litres and
costing more than Pounds 15,000 - to increase from sales of 190,000 this
year to 270,000 by 1996.

BRITISH AEROSPACE has won an order worth more than Pounds 40m to upgrade
Rapier surface-to-air missile units which it supplied to Oman 15 years ago,
David White writes.
The order is a further boost to BAe's guided weapons division after it won a
UK Ministry of Defence contract to supply a new air-to-air missile.
It involves bringing Oman's two Rapier squadrons up to current RAF
standards, including new computer systems, and marks the company's first
success in exporting the upgrade package for the low-level air-defence
missiles.
Oman is one of about a dozen countries fielding Rapier fire units. Other
clients in the region are the United Arab Emirates and Qatar.

FT  28 APR 92 / AEU chief raises spectre of Clause 4
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ISSUE of the Labour party's largely symbolic commitment to public
ownership has been thrown into the current leadership debate by Mr Bill
Jordan, leader of the AEU engineering union.
He called yesterday for the scrapping of Clause 4 of the party's
constitution, which pledges the party to supporting 'common ownership of the
means of production, distribution and exchange'.
His call came as the TGWU general union decided not to ballot its 1m members
before deciding who to support in the leadership contest.
Britain's biggest union had appeared to shift in favour of holding a ballot,
but decided at the last moment to revert to its original plan of consulting
members through its 8,000 branches.
In the most radical contribution to date from a union leader to the debate
about Labour's future, Mr Jordan told his union conference in Eastbourne
that Labour must become a party for managers and wealth creators and added
his voice to those demanding a substantial withdrawal of union involvement
in the Labour party.
He cautiously welcomed the appointments of Mrs Gillian Shephard to the
Employment Department and Mr Michael Heseltine to the Trade and Industry
Department as signs that the new government might be seeking more consensus
in industry.
Mr Jordan believes that the formal abolition of what has long since, in
practice, been superseded, would improve Labour's image. 'Clause 4 has
outlived its usefulness now,' he said. 'Labour have said they have no desire
for the common ownership of the means of production, but we need an
unambiguous statement about what Labour's position is.'
He said: 'While membership of the party is so public-sector top-heavy,
people will continue to say they are mainly a public-sector pressure group -
the party must work to correct this constituency imbalance.'

FT  28 APR 92 / Strict terms for Dollars 6bn fund to stabilise rouble
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN and GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE industrialised nations yesterday approved in principle the setting up of
a Dollars 6bn (Pounds 3.4bn) stabilisation fund for the rouble.
The Group of 10 nations - comprising the G7 countries plus Belgium, the
Netherlands, Sweden and Switzerland - said they were willing to activate the
General Arrangements to Borrow which would provide the International
Monetary Fund with the financial support needed to establish the
stabilisation fund.
However, successive ministers, assembled in Washington for the spring
meetings of the IMF and World Bank, made clear that the fund and other
financial support for Russia and other former Soviet republics would depend
on them meeting strict economic criteria.
The need for a comprehensive stabilisation programme was also underlined in
the statement issued after Sunday's G7 meeting.
The reform programme provides for:
Reduction of the budget deficit to stabilise the economy and reduce the role
of government.
Curbing monetary growth to bring inflation under control and stop the
extension of credit to unviable enterprises.
The establishment of the legal framework and contractual rights necessary to
permit a market economy to be developed. Reform of the agriculture and
energy sectors. A foreign exchange mobilisation system that enables the
independent states of the former Soviet Union to meet their international
payments.
A unified and market-determined exchange rate set at a realistic level.
Meanwhile, in his address to the IMF's policy-making interim committee, Mr
Norman Lamont, the UK chancellor, yesterday suggested that the stabilisation
fund should boost confidence in the rouble once a sufficiently tight
monetary stance in the rouble-zone countries had been established.
However, he said it would be difficult to find a correct parity for the
rouble. Decisions also had to be taken as to whether it should float, move
in a 'crawling peg' of adjustable parities or be fixed. He suggested that
the rouble should be pegged to the Ecu as part of the stabilisation
programme for the currency - a proposal supported by France.
However Mr Yegor Gaidar, Russia's first deputy prime minister, said later
that he wanted to peg the rouble to the dollar and allow it to fluctuate
within a 7 1/2 per cent margin either side of its exchange rate. He admitted
that fixing an exchange rate would be difficult, partly because Russia would
have higher inflation than the west, but his government intended to adopt a
single rate from July 1.
Mr Lamont said Russia needed a macro-economic stabilisation programme to
gain control of its inflation, monetary growth and budget deficits.
George Graham adds: Mr Gaidar warned US businessmen in Washington yesterday
that his country was obliged to tax imports and foreign residents' incomes.
He said Russia had lifted import duties temporarily during the period of
price liberalisation, in order to impose the discipline of import
competition on domestic producers who might otherwise have been tempted to
raise their prices too much. It was now necessary, he told a meeting at the
US Chamber of Commerce, to reimpose a flat import duty.
'We are not using this import tariff to protect our domestic producers, we
just want to raise tax revenue,' Mr Gaidar said.
Russia's new income tax, meanwhile, has worried some foreign businessmen who
say they will be unable to move employees to Russia because the new top rate
of 60 per cent would be so severe a cost.
Mr Gaidar said the income tax was 'a sad story', but necessary to comply
with IMF requirements.
'The problem is we have a strongly undervalued rouble, so when we apply our
income tax to foreigners they have very high incomes in roubles.'
Mr Gaidar said he hoped to introduce special exemptions or privileges for
foreigners.

FT  28 APR 92 / Painting a picture of pragmatism: The once-secretive IMF is
breaking with tradition and courtingthe press
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEW recruits at the International Monetary Fund were once expected to attend
a seminar entitled 'How to avoid the press'. Those days of obsessive secrecy
seem to have passed.
At the weekend fund officials broke with tradition by inviting the media to
a seminar on the 'design and implementation of IMF-supported programmes'.
The message was that the modern IMF is not a hard-nosed institution
interested only in devaluation and austerity. On the contrary, it is a
pragmatic organisation working in partnership with member governments to
find mutually acceptable solutions to diverse economic problems.
Officials said balance of payments viability was still the primary objective
of most programmes. But this goal was now almost inseparable from the
related objective of sustainable economic growth.
Balance of payments viability meant that a country could finance current
account deficits on private capital markets while repaying the IMF and other
official creditors.
Economic growth was an essential goal as otherwise balance of payments
improvements could be sustained only by compressing consumption and
investment - something unlikely to be politically acceptable for long. Low
and stable inflation, meanwhile, was seen as one of the pre-conditions for
steady growth.
IMF staff were anxious to stress several points:
There is no blueprint or rigid IMF model for achieving these objectives.
'Our policies are never off-the-peg, they are always tailor-made,' officials
stress.
Policies are not 'imposed' on governments. The IMF's role was to help
governments design and implement their own policies.
Income distribution is no longer ignored. Officials are 'aware that
programmes will have an impact on poor groups' and often advocate stronger
social safety nets.
There is no political bias. The IMF was involved with Hungary and Romania
before the collapse of communism and is willing to help socialist countries
today.
On technical aspects of programmes, officials denied any bias in favour of
devaluation. This was sometimes the only way to shift resources towards
export markets, but the likely cost in terms of higher inflation was no
longer ignored. Recently, for example in Poland and Czechoslovakia, the IMF
had advocated rigid exchange rates or 'nominal anchors' as a device for
curbing inflation.
On fiscal policy, officials said the IMF was wrongly caricatured as always
favouring tax increases as a means of cutting budget deficits. Its focus had
shifted to tax reform; it favoured measures to broaden tax bases and often
recommended cuts in tax rates.
Staff, however, conceded that many countries had common problems and so
programmes were often similar. High inflation and balance of payments crises
typically reflected public-sector imbalances - usually excessive budget
deficits financed through rapid credit creation.
Such mistakes could only be corrected through deflationary policies.
But the IMF was increasingly trying to address the structural causes of
macro imbalances. Budget deficits arose, for example, because governments
tried to maintain spending despite stagnant economies.
The solution often lay in tackling the structural causes of poor growth.
These included chronically overvalued exchange rates, artificially low
prices for key commodities (which discouraged their production), and pegged
interest rates leading to credit rationing.
Officials said programmes continued to be tightly monitored, with member
governments expected to meet quarterly targets for a range of financial
indicators. But they tried to draw the sting of conditionality, stressing
that targets were flexible: if slippage occurred for factors beyond
borrowers' control, disbursements would not be halted.
The extent to which the new pragmatism is reflected on the ground, in the
IMF's 50-odd economic programmes, may be doubted. But the seminar at least
helped clarify the IMF's economic aspirations.
Sceptics may detect a whiff of revisionism.
Officials stressed continuity of policies, but a decade ago the IMF was
putting far less emphasis on economic growth, structural reforms and social
safety nets.
Staff also conceded that the IMF's record could be improved: academic
studies indicate Fund programmes often do little or nothing to raise growth
or living standards.

FT  28 APR 92 / Preston focuses on aid for poor
</HEADLINE>

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Lewis Preston, World Bank president, is giving priority to securing
additional aid commitments for the poorest countries, in spite of heavy
demand for capital from former communist countries.
At the meetings this week in Washington, the bank is trying to persuade
governments to support the tenth replenishment of the International
Development Association (IDA), its soft-loan affiliate.
IDA loans are available only for countries with per capita incomes of
Dollars 800 (Pounds 452) or less. No interest is charged and maturities
extend to 40 years.
'Our objective is to persuade people that IDA Ten has to be significantly
better in real terms than IDA Nine,' Mr Preston said in an interview.
The bank managed to raise Dollars 15.5bn for IDA Nine, the three-year
replenishment that is to expire in the middle of next year. Mr Basil
Kavalsky, the official responsible for raising IDA funds, says that, if the
bank is to maintain the purchasing power of programmes, it will need at
least Dollars 18bn for IDA Ten, which runs from the middle of 1994.
However, Dollars 18bn will not meet needs because the populations of IDA
countries are rising rapidly and the number of nations qualifying for
concessional finance is growing.
To fund new recipients fully on the same basis as existing ones, the bank
would need an additional Dollars 2.5bn-Dollars 3bn, indicating a target for
IDA Ten of about Dollars 21bn.
Developing countries cannot be expected to spend as much on environmental
protection as rich nations and may have to set up their own regional trade
blocs if the Uruguay Round trade liberalisation talks are not concluded
soon.
These warnings were delivered by Mr Alejandro Foxley, the Chilean finance
minister and chairman of the joint IMF/World Bank development committee,
whose meeting today is expected to focus mainly on trade and environmental
issues, ahead of the Earth Summit to be held in Rio de Janeiro this June.

   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
'THE Big Seven demand that Russia legislates for private property,' declared
the splash headline in the evening paper Izvestia last night. The headline
ran above an account of the Group of Seven decision to follow through on its
offer of Dollars 24bn (Pounds 13.5bn) aid to Russia.
Interest in Moscow is focused more on the strings attached to the money and
the difficulties of implementing reform than the sum itself.
Izvestia noted: 'Since, at the past Congress of Peoples' Deputies, the
question of private ownership of land again fell without any decision being
made, this hardly makes the work of the Russian government with the IMF any
easier.'
Even those who welcomed the decisions in Washington stressed that the money
came at a heavy price. Mr Feodor Prokopov, first deputy minister of labour,
said: 'It is very welcome: it is a huge support for the government. But what
we must now do will be very hard.'
On the other side of the political fence, leaders of nationalist parties -
who met yesterday to assess results of the Congress and to promise more
active opposition to the government - accused Mr Yegor Gaidar, first deputy
prime minister, and his colleagues of crawling to the IMF and the G7 and of
being unable to guarantee the money will be forthcoming.
Mr Ilya Konstantinov, a leader of the Christian Democratic Movement and
chief economist for the grouping of nationalist parties, said the Dollars
24bn was merely a 'mythical injection': Dollars 6bn was earmarked for rouble
stabilisation at a time when the rouble could not be stabilised: Dollars 7bn
was to cover interest payments on foreign debt (which are not at present
being paid); and the remainder was not really committed.
World Bank governors have approved the membership of 13 of the 15 former
Soviet republics, adds Peter Norman. They will vote on membership of
Azerbaijan on May 4 and Turkmenistan on May 15.

<TEXT>
MR Jorge Chavez was yesterday removed by government decree from his post as
president of Peru's central bank, Sally Bowen writes from Lima.
Although his replacement, Mr German Suarez Chavez, is a long-serving central
bank official, local economists fear the change may herald increasing
government pressure on the bank to relax its reins on spending.
Mr Jorge Chavez has resisted several attempts to force his resignation since
President Alberto Fujimori suspended Peru's constitution on April 5 and
formed a de facto government backed by the armed forces. Mr Chavez defended
the bank's constitutional autonomy, saying he would refuse to use the
Dollars 1.4bn (Pounds 790m) in accumulated reserves to support
'macro-economic populism'.
The move to oust Mr Chavez, who leaves the bank along with three other
directors, came only days after the ratification of Mr Carlos Bolona as
minister of economy and finance. Disagreements over policy had punctuated
relations between the two men.

FT  28 APR 92 / The other Pennsylvania primary: A political race that is
capturing the imagination
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE really is a presidential primary in the fifth largest state of the
union today, but you would need sharp eyes and ears to know it. For
Pennsylvania has somebody else on its electoral mind and the name is not
George Bush, or Bill Clinton or Ross Perot but a 50-year-old woman who has
never run for political office before called Lynn Yeakel.
Last November the state elected as its senator a previously unregarded
Democrat by the name of Mr Harris Wofford, who defeated Mr Richard
Thornburgh, the former US attorney-general, two-time governor and
presidential intimate.
If this November it returns Ms Yeakel at the expense of another senior
Republican incumbent, then something quite remarkable will have happened.
And the effects will be felt far beyond the boundaries of the state.
Interest in Ms Yeakel's fate in the Democratic senate primary election today
far outstrips the concurrent presidential contests, which have been mundane
affairs with predictable outcomes. President Bush will win all the
Republican delegates and Governor Clinton more Democrats than anyone else.
Mr Jerry Brown, his only active opponent, seems suddenly to have lost steam.
This has left Mr Clinton free to raise his sights against Mr Bush and even
Mr Perot, the prospective independent candidate, but it has also meant he
has been unable to generate the sort of enthusiasm he will need in the
autumn to win back a state which has voted Republican in the last three
presidential elections. Anything less than a very easy victory today will
reinforce all the aired doubts about his electability.
Ms Yeakel had been thinking about getting elected to something for some time
but her mind was instantly made up six months ago when she watched Mr Arlen
Specter, the Pennsylvania Republican senator, grilling Professor Anita Hill
in the course of the hearings to confirm Judge Clarence Thomas to the
Supreme Court. So insulted was she by the nature of Mr Specter's attack on
Ms Hill's integrity and character that she took it on herself to get him out
of office.
Ms Yeakel is not without a reputation in the state as the head of Women's
Way, a group which promotes women's self-help in education, housing and the
social services. But this initially appeared to count for little since her
principal opponent in the Democratic primary was Lieutenant Governor Mark
Singel, the overwhelming party favourite son to take on Mr Specter.
But, on the eve of the primary, she seems to have come from nowhere in a
bitter and often vicious campaign to be running level with Mr Singel. She
has done this in part by borrowing from the Wofford manual, portraying
herself as the outsider versus the insider and placing great emphasis on
education, health and welfare problems, of which Pennsylvania has more than
its share.
But, in a year when women's issues may be a potent political factor, she has
done it mostly by playing the women's card. This has already turned up one
trump last month in Illinois, when Ms Carol Mosely Braun defeated the
incumbent Democratic Senator Alan Dixon as much as anything else on the
strength of the opposition of blacks and white women to Mr Dixon's vote to
confirm Judge Thomas to the Supreme Court.
Working against Ms Yeakel, both against Mr Singel today and, hypothetically,
against Mr Specter in November, is the fact that Pennsylvania rarely elects
women to state-wide office. Until Mr Wofford's victory last year, it had not
sent a Democratic senator to Washington in 30 years.
On the other hand, there is a growing national sense that there ought to be
more women in the US Senate (there are at present only two, Ms Barbara
Mikulski, the Democrat from Maryland, and Ms Nancy Kassebaum, the Republican
from Kansas) and in higher office generally. Ms Anne Richards, the current
governor of Texas, may even be on Mr Clinton's short-list of
vice-presidential candidates.
Thus, a Specter-Yeakel race, if it materialises, would be seen as a classic
confrontation between an experienced (and male) old hand and a woman with a
message. With most primaries for state office still to be held across the
country, a Yeakel victory today might well boost the cause of women
candidates elsewhere. This prospect engages Pennsylvania far more than
anything on the presidential front.

FT  28 APR 92 / Rival guerrilla forces fight on despite Kabul ceasefire

RIVAL guerrilla groups in Kabul, the Afghan capital, ignored a ceasefire
yesterday as they bombarded each other across the city.
The forces of Ahmed Shah Masood, commander of the northern based
Jamiat-i-Islam and now minister of defence, strengthened their grip on the
city but met fierce resistance from the Hezb-i-Islam led by Mr Gulbuddin
Hekmatyar. The Hezb-i-Islam was reported to be bringing up Pushtoon
reinforcements from the south - reflecting growing ethnic divisions behind
the conflict.
As the fighting continued for a third day - uninfluenced by the ceasefire
which the Pakistani government said had been signed in Peshawar - a convoy
including Mr Sibghatullah Mojaddedi, Afghanistan's president-elect, crossed
the Khyber Pass border from Pakistan en route to Kabul, where it was due to
arrive last night.
It was not clear what role there would be for the new interim government of
Mr Mojaddedi, a moderate guerrilla leader who was accompanied by other
members of a 50-member government commission set up under an agreement
reached by the mujahideen in Peshawar.
At the border an emotionally-charged crowd of war-hardened mujahideen
wielding Kalashnikov rifles repeatedly shouted 'Allah Akbar' (God is great)
as Mr Mojaddedi, a bearded academic, read a prayer of thanks for success in
their struggle to return to Afghanistan.
In Kabul hundreds of casualties were taken to hospitals and many families
evacuated from the southern suburb of Mekroyan which came under heavy
bombardment. The situation remained confused, however, as Hezb guerrillas,
driven out from one area, regrouped in another.
Few shops were open in the capital's largely deserted streets. But there was
widespread disgust that 13 years of civil war should end in further
conflict. 'What will happen to this country now? We are finished,' said a
taxi driver.
Near the Charaye Sadama in the centre of the city some of the first
prisoners of the conflict were being herded into what Abdur Rahman, a Jamiat
commander, called the 'mujahideen' prison. About 100 Hezb guerrillas
captured on a ridge were searched and pushed towards the door of a barracks
converted into a prison.
'We surrounded them and captured them,' said Abdur Rahman as nearby
artillery continued to shell Hezb positions. The new prisoners looked as
frightened and uncertain as they might have been if taken by the former
communist regime. One was found to have a revolver concealed behind his
back. He was roughly slapped around the face by an Uzbek militiaman.
'They will be put on trial,' said Abdur Rahman.
Mr Masood and his commanders had still to decide yesterday whether they
would risk the heavy bloodshed that could be caused by a frontal attack on
the Ministry of the Interior.
In the fighting Mr Masood's overall strategy seems to be to hit the
Hezb-i-Islam hard while leaving the door open to negotiations. But it will
take a long time to heal the wounds caused by the renewed conflict.

ISRAEL'S frantic drive led by the hardline Mr Ariel Sharon to provide
housing for a flood of immigrants from the former Soviet Union was attacked
yesterday for being ill-planned, sometimes illegally executed and for
wasting millions of dollars of public money.
A report by the State Comptroller, which severely embarrassed the ruling
Likud party two months ahead of a general election, also accused senior
housing ministry officials of abusing personal expenses, channelling
contracts to companies run by Likud members and throwing a party for Likud
activists.
Mr Sharon has long been a controversial figure who has used his position as
housing minister to spearhead a big increase in Jewish settlement in the
occupied territories.
He said in his defence that he had achieved the priority of overcoming a
housing emergency caused by the arrival of 400,000 immigrants since late
1989. Any instances of corruption or wrongdoing would be investigated.
But the report fuelled criticism that special powers given to Mr Sharon had
led to excessive building and gross overspending, inflating overall budget
deficits at a time when the economy was stagnating.
The report said: 'From the economic and financial point of view, it seems
the use of public money was not made subject to the proper checks and
balances, and considerations of efficiency and savings were not the guiding
line for decision makers.'

<TEXT>
A FIFTH round of Mideast peace talks opened in Washington yesterday with
Israel offering to hold Palestinian municipal elections in the occupied West
Bank and Gaza Strip.
In a hopeful sign, all five parties - Israel, Syria, Jordan, Lebanon and the
Palestinians - lowered the volume of rhetoric in briefings after the talks.
Israel's offer put in concrete form a proposal discussed in general terms in
previous rounds of the Mideast peace talks.
Israeli spokesman Benjamin Netanyahu said: 'Today we made several concrete
suggestions, the most prominent one being the proposal to have pilot
municipal elections in the territories.'
He said Israel was putting forward the suggestion in an effort to make
concrete progress in the talks.
But the proposal received a sceptical response from Palestinians who fear it
is an Israeli smokescreen to avoid holding the national elections they are
demanding. Palestinian spokeswoman Hanan Ashrawi said her delegation wanted
elections for all 1.75m inhabitants of the occupied territories and not just
the 30 per cent who lived in towns.
They wanted the elections to choose a legislative assembly that could take
control of the region.
Giving further promise of progress in the current round of talks - likely to
be the last round before Israeli general elections on June 23  - Syria
yesterday relaxed travel restrictions on its Jewish community. The move was
in response to Israeli demands as well as the prompting of the US and
moderate Arab states.

FT  28 APR 92 / ILO fears 10m jobless in Russia this year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
UNEMPLOYMENT in Russia is likely to rise to 10m-11m by the end of this year,
according to the first results of a study of Russian manufacturing
industries by the International Labour Organisation, one of the arms of the
UN.
Other foreign experts in Moscow think the ILO estimates too high although
they see unemployment rising sharply, to as high as 6m by the end of
December. They believe enterprises will lay off workers less rapidly than
the ILO thinks, and that the government will continue to subsidise
enterprises in various ways to avoid unemployment.
Officially, more than 100,000 are unemployed in Russia, although Mr Yegor
Gaidar, the first deputy prime minister, has also talked of about 6m by the
end of the year.
The study covers more than 500 plants in all manufacturing sectors in Moscow
and St Petersburg and their surrounding regions. The ILO team has been
researching changes on the shopfloor since December.
Mr Guy Standing, leader of the team, said that in spite of strenuous
government efforts, unemployment provision, social security benefits,
training programmes and labour market policies were rudimentary - hampered
by lack of cash, expertise and data.
Enterprises have preferred to pile up debts to each other and to banks
rather than lay off workers. Even defence plants, seen as among the most
vulnerable because of the sharp cut in allocations to defence equipment,
have continued to produce, even when uncertain of being paid.
However, Mr Standing said the ILO survey showed that:
Unemployment in the survey group had risen by about 9 per cent in 1991. Many
workers had not registered as unemployed partly because they were guaranteed
three months severance pay and partly because well below 20 per cent
actually received the small amount of unemployment benefit available.
Unemployment had already hit the most vulnerable and lowly paid, such as
women (who make up 40 per cent of the manufacturing labour force) and the
handicapped. Managers were laying off clerical white-collar staff, and
technicians and specialists - many with higher education - while skilled
manual workers were still in demand. Wages had risen strongly in the
manufacturing sector, though, in many instances, managers and workers
colluded in avoiding the high wages tax of last year (since reduced) by
paying workers wages in kind - usually in food supplies.
Though there are signs of more market-orientated behaviour, there was still
no clear relation between falling sales and reductions in staff.

post office. 'You have no information, and you just don't know what to do.'
Holding a small yellow booklet of vouchers, which he bought recently, as did
8m other Czechoslovaks to participate in the mass privatisation scheme
launched by the government this year, he peers anxiously around the room.
On both sides of him, people are forming long queues to register their
booklets with one of the 500 private investment funds which have mushroomed
in the country to benefit from privatisation.
Sunday was the last day for citizens to decide whether they would invest
their vouchers directly in companies or subscribe to an investment fund.
Under the Czechoslovak privatisation programme, more than 2,000 enterprises
will distribute the bulk of their equity this spring to those people who
paid a small fee to buy their voucher books.
However, with little information available on individual companies, and only
three more weeks available to bid for them singly, Czechs and Slovaks
hurried to post offices last week to register with one of the investment
funds which offer to help investors choose.
Officials predict that at least half of the investors will subscribe to a
fund rather than try to invest their vouchers directly.
Then again, the choice of a fund often remains arbitrary. At the central
post office in Prague, most admit to last-minute decisions.
'I found this advertising leaflet in my mail this morning,' says Ms Jindra
Justova, a 50-year-old mathematical analyst. 'It's a lottery anyway. Even if
you were given information on enterprises and chose to invest your vouchers
yourself, do you really think you could trust this information?' she asks
before joining the queue.
For weeks now, the government has promised to give future investors the
financial details of enterprises so as to facilitate choice.
Some information has been published in the press in recent months, showing
companies' income figures and privatisation plans - but these are only a
fraction of the 2,000 enterprises involved in the voucher scheme.
A complete list of them, recently published by the privatisation ministry in
the Czech republic, is nowhere to be found. 'It's sold out - sold out in one
day,' explains the post office clerk. Even at the ministry, the list cannot
be obtained.
When Mr Jaroslav Lizner, an official at the federal finance ministry finally
found a copy for the Financial Times, all it showed was a list of enterprise
names and their asset values.
'Its like a sport,' reckons Mr Jiri Sladek, an army technician. 'I just
decided to put all my vouchers into a fund set up by a major bank. That
should be safe.'
Behind him, Mr Jiri Davidek, a 55-year-old actor, adds with an amused look
in his eyes: 'I put them in a fund called the Fund for Retired People. At
least that's one thing I am sure of - I'll retire soon.'
Investment funds set up by main banks are attracting the most voucher
holders, but the wide array of funds offers plenty of choice for anyone who
likes a gamble.
The Srejber Tennis Investment Fund, set up by an old Davis Cup player, shows
in its advertising brochure a picture of Srejber himself next to Ronald and
Nancy Reagan.
On the radio, the Bonton Investment Fund blares advertising songs. Set up by
Michael Kocab, a former rock star turned MP after the anti-communist
revolution and founder of the Prague Millionaires' Club, the Bonton appeals
to young people.
'Michael Kocab made a fortune in the last two years, so he should be able to
make me rich in the next two,' says Frantisek Houska, a 23-year-old student
in jeans and leather who received his voucher book as a Christmas present
from his parents. Winking, he opens it at the page where, next to a series
of numbers, he has pencilled the code name of the Bonton.
One letter in each box spells TREND.

FT  28 APR 92 / Serbs proclaim new Yugoslavia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   BELGRADE, BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Serbian-controlled parliament yesterday decreed the demise of the
Yugoslav federation of six republics and proclaimed a new Yugoslavia within
the boundaries of Serbia and Montenegro.
By declaring itself the successor to the federal state, the new Serbian
Yugoslavia hopes to avoid the need to seek recognition of its successor
status from the European Community and other states.
But EC diplomats, with the exception of Greece, and diplomats from the US
and Canada distanced themselves from the new state by boycotting the muted
ceremony. It was attended by diplomats from China, Russia and many
non-aligned countries.
In Brussels, Community diplomats warned that the issue of the 'successor
state' was for all republics to decide in the EC-sponsored peace conference,
not Serbia unilaterally.
The new state, in which ethnic Serbs make up 62 per cent of the 10.5m
population, covers only 39 per cent of the territory of the former
federation. It includes 1.8m ethnic Albanians, who form more than 90 per
cent of the population of the southern province of Kosovo, and 346,000
ethnic Hungarians who comprise 16 per cent of Vojvodina, to the north. Both
gained autonomous status in 1974 under President Tito but lost it under
Serbia's President Slobodan Milosevic.
Diplomats in Belgrade say proclamation of the new state was advanced so as
to precede tomorrow's session of the Conference on Security and Co-operation
in Europe which is to debate exclusion of Yugoslavia. The EC and US have put
most blame on Serbia for destabilising Bosnia-Hercegovina, which was
recognised as independent on April 6.
Outside the parliament, an anti-Communist crowd chanted 'red bandits' as the
new flag was raised over the parliament which was elected in Communist-run
elections six years ago. The ceremony was boycotted by ethnic Albanians.
In an attempt to appease the west, the federal parliament also yesterday
hastily adopted a new constitutional law which promises the same respect for
human and minority rights as other CSCE member countries grant their
minorities.
Meanwhile, heavy shelling broke out last night in Sarajevo shortly after the
republic's President Alija Izetbegovic ordered the Yugoslav federal army,
seen as a defender of the Serbian minority, to leave. It was the first
outbreak of shooting in the capital since the EC-mediated ceasefire came
into force late on Friday.
In Lisbon preliminary talks began between Mr Jose Cutileiro, the EC's
special representative, and Serbian and Moslem delegations to the
EC-sponsored peace talks on Bosnia-Hercegovina. A Portuguese foreign
ministry spokeswoman said officials were still awaiting the Croat
delegation.

FT  28 APR 92 / Schwaetzer emerges from shadow of mentor
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MRS Irmgard Schwaetzer, nominated yesterday to succeed Mr Hans-Dietrich
Genscher as German foreign minister, is thus designated to occupy the most
powerful political post ever held by a woman in Germany, agencies report
from Bonn.
Mrs Schwaetzer, aged 50, spent four years as state secretary in the foreign
ministry before she became construction minister in Chancellor Helmut Kohl's
coalition cabinet in January 1991.
Mr Genscher was her mentor in the Free Democratic Party (FDP), junior
partner in the coalition, whose leaders have nominated her to succeed the
veteran minister when he steps down in mid-May.
The FDP executive and parliamentary delegation is to approve the choice at a
meeting today. Mr Kohl also has a say in the matter, but the chancellor said
it was the FDP's right to pick a successor under the terms by which the
coalition operates.
Mrs Schwaetzer first rose to national prominence as FDP general-secretary, a
post she took after the party had quit a federal coalition with the Social
Democrats in 1982 and formed a cabinet with Mr Kohl.
However, her nomination to the foreign ministry was a surprise after several
setbacks for her within the party in recent years, including losing to Mr
Otto Lambsdorff in a bid for the FDP national presidency in 1988. She had
quit as general-secretary in 1984.
Mrs Schwaetzer had campaigned for the party's top job as a reformer who
wanted to bring in younger blood and give the strongly pro-business party
more of a social conscience.
As construction minister, Mrs Schwaetzer has faced a national housing
shortage and steep rent increases in east Germany.
Last October, she was brushing off suggestions that she was seeking to
succeed Mr Genscher. 'I have my own profile in the FDP, involving social
issues,' she said.
Mrs Schwaetzer favours a liberal abortion law, contrary to Mr Kohl's
conservative Christian Democrats (CDU) and his right-wing Bavarian allies in
the Christian Social Union (CSU).
The minister-designate is a trained chemist and a stylish dresser who likes
to wear large tortoise-shell glasses. She is married to Udo Phillip, her
second husband and a television reporter. She has no children.

<TEXT>
ANYONE unable to postpone a visit to western Germany this week would be well
advised to take along a folding bicycle, strong walking shoes and plenty of
deodorant.
Natives in most areas hit yesterday, on the first day of Germany's first
public services strikes in 18 years, arrived at work sweaty after pedalling
or walking in through temperatures rising to more than 20`C.
Despite widespread disruption of local transport services in many areas, the
early effects were felt mainly by drivers trapped in traffic jams on roads
and motorways.
Air traffic was little affected, although the oTV union said it would be
'crippled' later. The first significant disruption is expected this week,
when support service workers may be called out.
Post deliveries were continuing in many areas, although they, too, are
expected to slow down as walk-outs of sorting staff and drivers have their
effect.
Directory inquiries was the only telephone service discernibly affected.
Berlin was one of the cities to fare worst. Although public transport in the
east was unaffected, movement in the west was hard-hit by bus and
underground stoppages after 15,000 transport depot workers had walked out.
Two-hour queues for taxis were reported at east Berlin's Friedrichstrasse
local rail and underground station, the terminus in the days when the city
was divided. Rain added to the discomfort.
Frankfurt's main railway station, which handles 300,000 passengers a day,
reported traffic flowing but subject to delays.
Pre-strike preparations by the rail authorities, including running trains
with only four or five carriages, and allowing only mainline trains in and
out, had so far foiled the strikers' immediate aim of paralysing traffic.
Most rail links around Munich kept running - local drivers are civil
servants and not allowed to strike - although action by ancillary staff led
to delays during the day.
Union officials stressed that worse was to come. 'Almost all' public
transport workers in North-Rhine Westphalia, the most densely populated and
heavily industrialised state, are to join the strike today.
Mercedes Benz, one of Germany's leading car and lorry makers, is to cut its
workforce by 20,000 over the next two years, according to Mr Werner Niefer,
chairman. 'Introducing such a short-term programme is urgently necessary if
we are to remain competitive, most notably with the Japanese,' he added.
Job cuts were only part of a wide-ranging programme, he said. The model
range had to be extended and production methods adapted.
The aim was to cut costs by 10-12 per cent. Other objectives were to
increase research and development links with components suppliers, reduce
the range of parts used in Mercedes cars and lorries, and improve plant
working times.
Reductions in the payroll would come from redundancies, early retirement and
natural wastage, Mr Niefer said.

FT  28 APR 92 / Walesa looks to France for his presidential model
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BOBINSKI
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WARSAW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Lech Walesa yesterday announced his intention of becoming a
Gaullist-style executive president and further undermined his prime
minister, Mr Jan Olszewski, by naming two other candidates as better suited
to haul Poland out of its deepening political crisis.
'Our present system isn't functioning,' he told a news conference, 'so I am
suggesting a French-style presidential system to improve the efficiency of
government.'
He named Mr Tadeusz Mazowiecki, leader of Poland's largest party and prime
minister of the first post-Communist government as the best man to get
Poland's fractured political parties working together. But he also singled
out Mr Andrzej Olechowski, the finance minister, as 'the best qualified
person if we want quick and resolute reform'.
Despite his public endorsement for the two men, however, he stopped short of
asking Mr Olszewski to resign his premiership, adding: 'I don't exclude this
possibility even though there is no such necessity today.'
Mr Olechowski, a former senior trade and central bank official, is already a
key member of Mr Olszewski's government. He recently secured cabinet support
for cuts in public spending needed to keep the budget deficit below 5 per
cent of GDP.
But the cuts, which were needed to gain International Monetary Fund support
for Poland's economic reforms, still have to be approved by parliament. On
Friday parliament delayed for two weeks a vote to nullify a court ruling
which called on the government to reinstate welfare and pension cuts made
last year.
Failure to achieve the required 75 per cent support to overturn the court
ruling would double the proposed budget deficit and risk rekindling
hyperinflation. Mr Olechowski has made clear he would resign if this
happened, which in turn would almost certainly cause the collapse of the
government.
The difficulty of forming a solidly based government capable of supporting
tough economic policies from a fractured elected parliament of 29 political
parties and the ambiguous role played by Mr Walesa have underlined the need
for constitutional reform.
Mr Walesa spoke yesterday of the need to follow democratic procedures. But
in a clear reference to the possibility that he might put himself at the
head of a populist movement to back his demands, the former leader of the
anti-communist Solidarity movement warned that he did not 'exclude being
forced to be a strong president backed by a large party if these
calculations with the presidential system don't work'.

FT  28 APR 92 / Lloyds to announce Midland bid: Hostile offer today is
expected to be worth 'considerably' more than 400p a share
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LLOYDS BANK will announce this morning that it plans to bid for its rival
Midland Bank, challenging Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation which
already has a Pounds 3.3bn offer on the table for the UK clearing bank.
Bankers said last night that the announcement will be made this morning. It
will be the first time a UK clearing bank has made a hostile attempt to
acquire another UK clearer. Midland is likely to oppose the bid.
If the bid succeeds, it will mean huge job losses and the biggest upheaval
in UK banking since a wave of mergers in the 1960s.
Mr Brian Pearse, Midland's chief executive, said his board would have to
read Lloyds' terms before deciding whether to oppose the offer. But he
reiterated that an offer from Lloyds was likely to be unwelcome.
Mr Pearse is worried that a bid could unsettle the morale of his staff, who
would be concerned about job losses should Lloyds succeed.
Lloyds, advised by the merchant bank Baring Brothers, is expected to say
that it will offer considerably more than 400p for each Midland share.
That compares with Hongkong Bank's offer of new shares and bonds which at
yesterday's market prices were worth 400p per Midland share. Midland shares
rose 6p to close at 381p last night.
Lloyds' offer will be one of the most politically controversial takeover
attempts since 1981, when Hongkong Bank and Standard Chartered bank both
made abortive attempts to buy the Royal Bank of Scotland.
Bifu, the banking union, has already made plain its opposition to a Lloyds
bid. It is concerned because Lloyds plans to make about 20,000 employees
redundant from the banks' combined UK workforces of 100,000.
The other reason the bid will be sensitive is that Midland and Lloyds each
have shares of about 15 per cent of the market for small business loans.
Small and medium size companies fear the combination of Midland and Lloyds
would have an adverse effect on competition in this market.
Lloyds has delayed making its move on Midland because of its concern that
these competition concerns would lead the Office of Fair Trading to refer
its offer for lengthy scrutiny by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission, the
UK competition authority.
To minimise this threat to competition, Lloyds has been trying to find a
bank without a big presence in the UK which would be prepared to take
control of more than 500 of its and Midland's branches should its bid
succeed.
OFT sources said that if Lloyds pulled off such a deal on the branches, that
might persuade the MMC to allow the takeover, but would probably not prevent
a reference of the deal to the MMC.
Mr Pearse is concerned that customers and staff would be so unsettled while
the MMC spent months investigating a Lloyds bid that the market value of
Midland might be damaged. The Bank of England has been kept closely informed
of Lloyds' intentions. It is expected to remain neutral in the bid battle.
The Bank has traditionally been unhappy about banks making hostile bids for
each other. However, it does not believe that a bid by Lloyds will damage
the interests of Midland's depositors, so it will not intervene.
Lloyds' decision to bid is a victory for Mr Brian Pitman, its chief
executive. He believes combining with Midland will generate additional
annual profits of more than Pounds 500m by making the 20,000 redundancies
over three years and closing about 1,000 branches.

FT  28 APR 92 / Boothroyd elected Speaker in break with tradition
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE House of Commons broke with centuries of tradition yesterday in choosing
Miss Betty Boothroyd, the colourful 62-year-old Labour MP for West Bromwich
West, as its Speaker.
Her victory in the first contested election for the position in more than 40
years makes her the first woman in the six centuries since the post was
created to occupy the most powerful - and frequently controversial - job at
Westminster.
It also marked a break with the more recent postwar tradition that the
Speaker is drawn from the governing party in the Commons rather than from
the opposition.
A deputy speaker since 1987, Miss Boothroyd beat off a challenge from Mr
Peter Brooke, the former Northern Ireland secretary, to win the backing of
372 MPs compared with 238 against, a comfortable majority of 134.
In theory, the Speaker's job is simply to preside over Commons proceedings
and to maintain order during debates. In practice, the authority to allow or
disallow emergency debates, to select the order of speakers and to settle
all procedural disputes gives the office unique power.
Miss Boothroyd, whose modest background first led her into a career as a
professional dancer with the Tiller girls, succeeds Mr Bernard Weatherill as
the 155th Speaker. With the job comes a Pounds 65,000-a-year salary, a large
house within the precincts of the palace at Westminster, and one of the few
state coaches allowed to commoners.
Her election was helped by the divided loyalties of Tory MPs, who backed
three other potential candidates apart from Mr Brooke. It was assured when
Mr John Biffen, a former cabinet minister and leader of the Commons, led
more than 70 Tory MPs in support of her.
His judgment that Miss Boothroyd had displayed as Deputy Speaker over the
past five years the relevant qualities of fairness, tact, humour and respect
for the authority of the Commons was widely shared.
Mr John Major, who subsequently joined Mr Neil Kinnock in offering warm
congratulations to Miss Boothroyd, abstained from voting.
Most of his cabinet colleagues supported Mr Brooke.

FT  28 APR 92 / Kohl backs employers as strikes cripple cities
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE GERMAN government stood its ground yesterday as the main public sector
union called 75,000 workers out on strike, crippling local transport in
several important cities, and prepared to bring other services to a halt.
Mr Helmut Kohl, the chancellor, said the employers' final 4.8 per cent pay
offer had his 'full support', and that he was unable to improve on it. But
as he spoke Mrs Monika Wulf-Mathies, president of the union, the oTV,
demanded payment of its original 9.5 per cent claim.
Heartened by an 89 per cent vote for strike action among her 900,000 members
in western Germany, she renounced her earlier acceptance of an arbitration
offer of 5.4 per cent.
The weight of voting for strike action, and early signs of good
co-ordination among the half-dozen unions involved, suggest a hard battle
ahead.
The government is committed to cutting costs and the record federal deficit.
By giving in to the public sector unions it would be widely seen to be
encouraging militancy among private sector workers. IG Metall, the 4m-member
engineering union, has already called warning strikes later this week as a
protest against the employers' 3.3 per cent pay offer.
However, the mood among travellers was generally cheerful, helped by warm
spring weather. Commuters endured massive traffic jams or walked or cycled
to work. Traffic flow was further hampered by unpunished illegal parking.
Striking traffic wardens in Cologne, instead of giving out tickets, papered
cars and vans with notes appealing for support.
The first wave of stoppages in the public sector strike was specifically
aimed at public transport. Transport services were halted in 11 cities. Some
15,000 of the 17,500 transport union members in Berlin stayed away.
All-out transport stoppages are expected to spread to other areas today,
including the industrial centres of North Rhine Westphalia. Further
disruption, affecting airports, rubbish collection, ancillary services to
schools and hospitals, local and national administration, street repairs and
other essential public services will take effect progressively, union
leaders warned. The DPG post office union, meanwhile, called out 8,500
workers in key sorting centres. Action by signal-box staff disrupted trains
in Frankfurt and Dortmund, while the main rail union, GdED, threatened
further escalation.
The oTV has started the action well armed with about DM600m (Pounds 204m) in
its strike fund. Strike pay will cost it an estimated DM1m a day for every
10,000 members taking action.
Its last national strike, in 1974, ended with an 11 per cent pay deal. Then,
it called out 139,000 bus, tram and train drivers and rubbish collectors on
the first day. On day two, a further 40,000 members joined in. The employers
settled on the third day.

MR Hans-Dietrich Genscher, Germany's foreign minister for the past 18 years,
is to resign next month.
The announcement of his decision yesterday stunned the political
establishment in Bonn and marks the end of an era in German foreign policy.
It is also likely to cause new strains within the coalition government of
Chancellor Helmut Kohl.
Mr Genscher's successor was named swiftly as Mrs Irmgard Schwaetzer, 50,
formerly the state secretary for European affairs, and most recently the
construction minister. Mr Kohl was anxious to avoid any large cabinet
reshuffle at a sensitive time.

<TEXT>
THE Ukrainian government is considering restarting undamaged nuclear
reactors in the Chernobyl complex, site of the 1986 meltdown which is
estimated to have led to between 6,000 and 8,000 deaths.
The authorities say they may restart two reactors there unless international
help is forthcoming to install a boiler independent of the plant to provide
heating for the population still working in and around it.
This was revealed yesterday by Mr Carlo Ripa di Meana, the European
Community's environment commissioner. He underlined the 'high and permanent
risk' of Chernobyl-type disasters at other sites in the former Soviet Union.
He was speaking at a news conference following his talks last week in Moscow
and Kiev with senior scientists and government officials.
Mr Ripa di Meana said they had provided information on 24 nuclear reactors
which needed to be shut down, 'several dozen' obsolete nuclear-powered
submarines which needed to be decommissioned, as well as unguarded nuclear
waste sites.
'The staggering scale of this kind of endeavour will be a matter of survival
both for them and for us,' Mr Ripa di Meana said.
All four reactors at Chernobyl are shut down, after the meltdown in one
reactor six years ago and a fire in a second reactor last year. Although the
Ukrainian authorities intend to close the complex at the end of next year,
Mr Ripa di Meana said they were examining whether to use for a year the two
reactors that they 'consider in relatively good shape'. He said Ukrainian
officials were due in Brussels soon to discuss alternatives.
Mr Ripa di Meana said he had returned 'shocked' by the nuclear risk in the
former Soviet republics: 'I think that every night without a problem is a
good night. They are aware that at any moment there could be a new
Chernobyl.'
The priority was to deal with 11 Chernobyl-type reactors in Russia, three in
the Ukraine and two in Lithuania, though he also drew attention to four
later-generation reactors and four plutonium reactors in Russian military
complexes. 'They are all using obsolete technology and being managed in a
relatively unsafe and inefficient manner,' he said.
Mr Yegor Gaidar, Russia's deputy prime minister, calculated the cost of
decommissioning the reactors and replacing them with new ones at Dollars
1.2bn each, Mr Ripa di Meana said. An alternative was an energy-saving
policy, costing about Dollars 15bn, that would reduce current energy use by
about 25 per cent.

FT  28 APR 92 / Survey of Poland (25): Minister in the hot seat - Profile of
Andrzej Olechowski
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BOBINSKI and ANTHONY ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
POLISH politics is full of ambitious men, but few mask their intentions
better than Mr Andrzej Olechowski, 44, the new finance minister. Tall,
good-looking and with an irreverent sense of humour, Mr Olechowski slipped
into the hottest seat two months ago.
The appointment transformed the government's image at a difficult moment.
His predecessor, Karol Lutkowski, had just resigned amid desperate calls for
further cuts in spending.
An academic by nature, Mr Lutkowskihad felt unsure of curbing the spending
instincts of his cabinet colleagues and keeping the budget deficit within
acceptable limits. Abroad, his resignation was taken as a signal that the
monetary floodgates were about to burst and that Poland's free market
reforms were fated to founder in waves of inflation.
Mr Olechowski moved fast to control the damage. He quickly established a
rapport with Mr Jerzy Eysymontt, the chief economics minister. This meant
accepting the latter's priority of halting Poland's recession at the cost of
achieving single-digit inflation before 1994. In Washington, he pursuaded
the International Monetary Fund to accept a budget deficit pared to 5 per
cent of the GDP.
Next, with the strong backing of Mr Jan Olszewski, the prime minister, he
persuaded the cabinet to accept the strictures of the new budget. The
greatest test is ahead as the budget still has to be implemented and more
painful spending cuts may be necessary.
In his youth Mr Olechowski was as passionate about western pop music as he
later became about western economics. He became a disc jockey on a Warsaw
radio programme while studying at Warsaw's school of economics in the later
years of party boss Wladislaw Gomulka.
His climb up the career ladder has given him unmatched experience. He stands
out among most of Poland's political establishment for whom honours won in
struggles with the communists still count more than competence.
He is politically unattached. His views are a mixture of conviction that
monetary controls must be tough to check inflation, and a pragmatism which
recognises that change in the efficiency of government and in the state
industrial sector will come faster if pushed from above.
A patriot with a keen sense for Poland's history, Mr Olechowski shares the
belief of most Poles that the country must forge close links with the west
if modernisation is to be achieved.

FT  28 APR 92 / Survey of Poland (26): Little-known premier - Profile of Jan
Olszewski
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BOBINSKI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
POLAND'S Prime Minister Jan Olszewski is little known outside his country's
borders. The rather crumpled-looking, 61-year-old lawyer, with bushy
eyebrows spent most of his life doggedly opposing communism and defending as
best he could the civil and human rights of those condemned in the courts of
the communist regime. It was thanks to people like him that Poland managed
to blunt the impact of Soviet domination after the war.
His biography is a very Polish one, even to the extent that until his first
visit to Italy shortly after becoming prime minister he had never travelled
abroad. He was born in Warsaw, the son of a railwayman in a home whose
traditions were strongly linked to the country's socialist movement. During
the war he joined the scout-based resistance and went on to study law.
In 1956, during the 'October liberalisation' which followed the death of
Stalin he wrote for the Po Prostu weekly, the reform movement's mouthpiece.
In the 1960s he embarked on a career as a lawyer. He defended a long list of
dissidents, many of whom are now his political opponents.
In those years he brought his natural eloquence to bear with equal passion
on judges in city courts and minor officials in dusty local tribunals in
cases where sentences were fixed in advance and the defence spoke more to
succour the accused than to affect the verdict.
This impressively single-minded pursuit of justice in what seemed hopeless
circumstances was the domain of only a handful of the legal profession at
the time. In 1968, after the student riots, it led to Mr Olszewski's
temporary suspension from the bar.
His determination was accompanied by a passion for politics. His secret
vehicle was the Polish Independence Agreement, a small think-tank he helped
run between 1975 and 1980 with Mr Zdzislaw Najder, now his closest adviser.
When the Solidarity alliance of workers, intellectuals and church burst upon
the scene in 1980, Mr Olszewski helped to write the movement's statute and
became an adviser during martial law. He also worked for the Polish bishops,
forging links which mean that the influential Polish church is happy to
support him at the head of the government.
In 1984, he represented the family of the dissident priest Father Jerzy
Popieluszko, murdered by secret police, at the trial of the killers. But in
1989, when Solidarity sat down with the communists to negotiate what later
turned out to be a peaceful transfer of power, Mr Olszewski was critical of
what he thought were too intimate links with the country's rulers.
He argued that communists should be removed from positions of influence
wherever possible and came to power with that demand at the top of his
programme. But that promise, like the pledge that energetic steps would be
taken to counter the economic recession, has been blunted by the realities
of government.
Once in power Mr Olszewski accepted that economic policies had to be
conducted in agreement with the International Monetary Fund, which had at
first been critical of his programmes. He also showed a pragmatic streak in
dropping demands for widespread purges, arguing instead for a reform of the
structures of power to eliminate the last vestiges of the communist system.
Mr Olszewski can be tough when he choses to be. He refused to continue
efforts to form a government early in 1991 when it became clear that
President Walesa wanted to have a final say over every ministerial
appointment. Now he faces another tussle with the President over who has
authority over the armed forces.

FT  28 APR 92 / Survey of Poland (24): Hero's popularity wanes - Profile of
Lech Walesa
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY ROBINSON and CHRISTOPHER BOBINSKI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Polish presidency sits increasingly uncomfortably on the shoulders of
Lech Walesa, the working class hero of the 1980s. As the man who arguably
did more than any other individual to spur the collapse of the Soviet empire
his place in recent history is assured. But assessment of his role in the
post-communist Poland he helped to bring about is likely to be much less
flattering.
His insistence on holding elections in the autumn of 1990 to replace the
communist-era president, General Wojciech Jaruzelski, has proved a mixed
blessing.
The elections further distanced Poland from its communist past. But in the
process he broke what remained of the old Solidarity alliance of workers,
intellectuals and church at a time of considerable political stress. The
election revealed growing popular disillusion with the new democracy and the
economic sacrifices it demanded. It was also difficult to distinguish
between political arguments in favour of a democratically elected presidency
and the ill-concealed personal ambition of Mr Walesa himself.
The electorate's reluctance to give a blank cheque to such a mercurial
character of great, if erratic, political intuition but limited formal
education, was reflected in a low turnout and unexpectedly strong showing
for his dark-horse rival, the populist Polish-Canadian businessman, Mr Stan
Tyminski.
Mr Walesa's original hopes of being swept into the Belveder presidential
palace by a virtual plebiscite were also dashed by growing concern,
especially among Solidarity intellectuals, at his growing
self-identification with Marshall Joszef Pilsudski, the Polish strongman of
the inter-war sanacja period.
Once elected, President Walesa embarked on a series of foreign state visits
to raise Poland's profile abroad and drum up foreign investment. But his
ambivalent attitude towards the economic sacrifices demanded by the
IMF-backed economic stabilisation strategy undermined the efforts of his
finance minister to push for the radical market reforms which attracted
investor interest.
His proposal, for example, that all Poles should be lent the equivalent of
Dollars 10,000 through the privatisation of state enterprises did much to
confuse an already difficult debate and has resurfaced recently to further
complicate the privatisation process.
But the confusion of roles between parliament, the government and the
president really came to a head after the October elections last year which
resulted in an atomised parliament of 29 parties and a shaky coalition
government headed by a man with a proven track record of non-compliance with
presidential wishes.
Mr Walesa's awkward relationship with the popularly elected parliament is
reflected by the seating arrangements of the Sejm, the lower house. Mr
Walesa sits, surrounded by a handful of advisers, on a sort of throne up in
the balcony above the chamber. Up to now he has never participated in any
debate but alternately glowers or stares in a bored fashion on proceedings.
Surrounded by a narrow group of advisers and deprived of the influence he
exerted on the previous government, which was essentially chosen by him and
made up largely of men from his Gdansk power base, Mr Walesa has appeared
increasingly frustrated. He was, for example, kept in the dark about a
series of personnel changes among senior military officers. Pending
finalisation of a new constitution, however, Mr Walesa still formally
retains many of the powers of his communist predecessor, including commander
of chief of the armed forces.
In this capacity he organised meetings between his advisers and senior
military officers. This provoked an angry response from the minister of
defence, Mr Jan Parys, who warned publicly of the danger of a coup.
In a conciliatory move prime Minister Jan Olszewski packed his defence
minister off 'on holiday' but the incident sparked off a wave of press
criticism which revealed the strength of opposition to Mr Walesa's efforts
to remain a major player in his own right.
The coming months will probably see continuing efforts to persuade the
president to accept a more limited figurehead role. But it will not be easy.
He still has faith in his historic role and is concerned that western Europe
is not showing enough foresight in its approach to eastern Europe,
economically and militarily.
'I fear we won't always be on time with our preparations but will find
ourselves mostly following events,' he says referring to the prospect of
strife in the former Soviet Union and elsewhere and the westward emigration
that could bring.
He proposes the establishment of a UN task force made up 'of a division or
two from each country' which could move quickly to stifle conflicts. The
establishment of such a force, he says, should be preceded by a solemn pact
binding all European countries to abstain from using force and call in these
international arbiters should the need arise.

FT  28 APR 92 / Survey of Poland (27): Miracle-maker - Profile of Leszek
Balcerowicz
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE START of Poland's bold attempted leap from central planning to market
discipline was linked to the name of one man - Leszek Balcerowicz. After
more than 45 years of communist distortion, this lean, intense, academic
economist became finance minister in autumn 1989 and was suddenly given the
chance to put theories of economic transition into practice.
For the first six months of 1990 his IMF-backed stabilisation policies
performed miracles. Hyperinflation was blocked in its tracks, a huge
monetary overhang was eliminated, the zloty was made internally convertible
and regained its lustre, private enterprise blossomed.
Abroad his views and experience continued to be actively sought, especially
by the young Russian reformers around Mr Yegor Gaidar. But at home criticism
of his alleged insensitivity to the social costs of transition mounted
throughout 1991 as lower trade barriers and an increasingly overvalued zloty
put pressure on domestic producers andunemployment started to soar.
Inflation also remained dangerously high, fuelled by a soaring budget
deficit which Mr Balcerowicz, for all his 'iron man' image, proved unable to
contain.
In an interview shortly after leaving the finance ministry Mr Balcerowicz
displayed the quiet but passionate conviction in market-orientated reform
which made him the moral as well as intellectual driving force behind
Poland's first two post-communist governments.
But he does not hide his frustration at the political and institutional
barriers to reform which have emerged.
He recalls that when Poland pioneered the reform process in January 1990,
inflation was running at an annualised rate of around 2,000 per cent and
there were shortages of everything. Within weeks the shops were full and by
August inflation fell back to 1.8 per cent. But after a mistaken mid-year
easing of monetary policy, inflation began rising again to 3 to 4 per cent
monthly, which has become a clear sign that underlying structural problems
need to be tackled.
Even so, Poland has not done badly, he argues, when compared to more
fortunate Hungary and Czechoslovakia. They embarked on reform with lower
inflation, fewer shortages and, in Hungary's case, a strong head start
thanks to earlier reforms of crucial areas such as banking and taxation.

FT  28 APR 92 / Survey of Poland (22): Back from the brink - The Baltic
shipyards
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FIVE ships are under construction for South African owners in Polish
shipyards, a sign of the revolution in Poland's foreign economic relations
and the competitive strength of the shipyards on Poland's Baltic coast.
The upturn in worldwide shipping orders and the wholesale closure of
shipyards in the UK and elsewhere over the past decade has opened new
opportunities for an industry which faced bankruptcy in the 1980s.
Gdansk shipyard, which in August 1980 became the focus of attention after a
shipyard electrician called Lech Walesa leapt over the shipyard fence to
rally workers behind a strike which led to the birth of Solidarity, was
threatened with closure by the communist government only four years ago.
Now shipyard director Mr Hans Szyc says the yard has orders worth more than
Dollars 1bn and is negotiating new orders worth Dollars 250m. Output rose 28
per cent in 1990 and a further 21 per cent last year but with domestic
interest rates at around 60 per cent per annum and wages constrained by the
government's popiwek tax on wage increases, the industry is constrained by
tight credit and shortages of skilled labour, in spite of the more than 2m
officially unemployed.
Thousands of skilled workers left Gdansk shipyards when it was under threat
of closure. 'Now we are left either with the old workers or the young
recruits. We employ over 7,200 but we need another 1,000 skilled production
workers to get to full production. At present we're only working at about 50
per cent capacity,' says Mr Szyc.
The labour shortage, partly relieved by a group of 200 gastarbeiter shipyard
workers from St Petersburg, is partly a result of low wages and harsh
working conditions and partly a function of low productivity. It takes about
700,000 man hours on average to build a ship at Gdansk, twice the West
European or Far Eastern levels. Wage rates by contrast are only 10 per cent
of European and Asian levels although on average labour costs account for
only 6 per cent of total shipbuilding costs.
Gdansk, with its old facilities and sprawling lay-out, traditionally
concentrates on building specialist, high-value ships. Two of the five ships
on order for South Africa - both reefer ships for Safmarine - are being
built here. A further 10 such ships are on order, including six for
Norwegian owners. The order book also includes four Ro-Ro (roll-on,
roll-off) ships for Finnish owners and three container ships for French and
German operators.
Last year, the state-owned shipyard lost 280bn zlotys on its fixed price
contracts as costs rose in line with inflation while the zloty's steady
appreciation cut revenue.
The picture is brighter in the more modern and rationally laid out yards at
Szczecin and Gdynia. The latter, which is a serious candidate for
privatisation, has just won two orders for 110,000-tonne, double-hulled
Afromax tankers from Burmeister and Wain of Denmark, bringing the total
order book to well over 1m tonnes.
Apart from two dry docks, one able to accommodate ultra- large tankers and
equipped with a huge gantry crane capable of lifting 900-tonne blocks,
Gdynia also has some of the most modern cutting and welding equipment of any
European yard.
The competitiveness of the shipyard was recently revealed when a customer
was required to explain to insurers the reasons for ordering ships from
Gdynia. The Polish yard was able to offer a contract price of around Dollars
44m for an Afromax tanker for which Korean and Japanese shipyards were
asking between Dollars 52-54m with slightly lower specifications.
The Asian shipyards were able to deliver in 14 to 16 months while Gdynia
took between 24 and 28 months. This was partly a question of order books and
partly man-hours. While the Japanese yards required 500,000 man-hours at
Dollars 25 an hour, the Polish yard expected to consume 1.25m man-hours at a
rate of Dollars 1 and hour.
In the past, the profitability of Polish yards has been handicapped by poor
payment conditions. Contracts requiring only 20 per cent of the price during
construction and 80 per cent on completion were common. This left heavy
exposure to domestic interest rates of 60 per cent and higher.
The yards have also had to absorb the retroactive removal of the 20 per cent
government subsidy. In addition, Polish yards have been left with several
nearly completed or completed ships ordered by the former Soviet Union but
not delivered because of the collapse of the old rouble trading system.
Several older orders have been re-negotiated on more favourable terms,
however, and new orders are only accepted with heavy up-front and progress
payments written in. With shipowners around the world renewing ageing fleets
the Polish yards are confident of better times and good order books until
well into the next century, but need much re-organisation and change in the
meantime.

FT  28 APR 92 / Survey of Poland (21): Challenging future - Heavy industry
is due for radical restructuring
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THESE are trying times for Polish heavy industry, often saddled with
pollutive, obsolescent plant and still managed by communist-era
administrators. They are under pressure from powerful workers councils to
maintain employment and from a government desperate to privatise and to keep
public sector wage increases below the rate of inflation.
The past two years have seen a nearly 40 per cent drop in production and
most of this is concentrated in the mining, steel-making and heavy
engineering sectors which are all candidates for radical restructuring and
privatisation where possible. Some sectors, such as power engineering, are
already in the throes of re-organisation under foreign owners like ABB, and
other sectors such as shipbuilding also have good prospects for
privatisation.
The problem areas are the coal mines and steel plants which, once emblematic
industries of the old regime. Coal production has dropped from a peak of
190m tonnes in the 1980s to around 140m tonnes and many mines are
threatened. Longer term, the emphasis will shift towards boosting domestic
gas production and more efficient, less polluting coal-burning technologies.
The steel industry, at present working at around 60 per cent of its
18m-tonne capacity, is also being painfully re-structured. Last month the
government decided to create a new holding company which will rationalise
production at the Huta Katowice and Huta Lenina plants near Krakow with the
loss of several thousand jobs. A new Dollars 120m continuous casting steel
line from Mannesman in Germany, at present still packed up in crates, will
be installed at Katowice to improve productivity and lower costs as
steel-making is concentrated on the largely Soviet-designed plant.
In spite of the problems, mining of copper, sulphur, silver and coal as well
as ship-building and heavy industry are still principal hard currency
earners. Huta Katowice, for example, exported 70 per cent of its 3.7m-tonne
production last year, much of it at a loss, apart from its finished products
such as rails, beams and profiles. Until now, no large or medium-sized state
enterprise has gone bankrupt and many are keeping going by involuntary
inter-enterprise credits, built up through a chain of non-payment which has
to be broken if inflation is to be reduced and the banking system kept
afloat.
But Poland needs to modernise its railway and road infrastructure, its power
generating plants, and much of its industrial base. All this requires a
substantial heavy industrial capacity. Restructuring to produce the sinews
of its own industrial regeneration, and finding the investment capital to do
so, is the real challenge ahead for Poland and the international financial
institutions.

FT  28 APR 92 / Survey of Poland (23): Magic label for sales - ABB is well
placed to seize business opportunities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BOBINSKI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AT SOME point the modernisation of Poland's pollutived and inefficient
energy system will cease to be a problem of huge dimensions and become a
significant business opportunity for the suppliers of efficient generating
and transmission equipment. ABB, the Swedish-Swiss engineering group, is
positioning itself for that moment.
The decision to move east was taken by Mr Percy Barnevik, ABB's chief
executive, and his board in January 1989. Poland and the giant Zamech
engineering plant in the northern town of Elblag, with which ABB had
longstanding licensing agreements, became one of its first targets. After 15
months of talks, first with the communists and then with a Solidarity-led
government, a new company ABB Zamech was put in place.
ABB took a 76 per cent stake in the new company with the state retaining 19
per cent and 5 per cent reserved for employees. It was also granted a
six-year profits tax holiday. ABB put up Dollars 15m for its share of the
factory and invested a further Dollars 10m in machinery and equipment. It
also pays Dollars 4m a year for a five-year lease on the buildings which
used to build U-boats.
Since then, ABB has invested in seven other Polish factories, its latest
acquisition being the Elta transformer plant in Lodz where it paid Dollars
10.4m for a 51 per cent stake. ABB employs about 10,000 people, making it
Poland's largest foreign employer.
Re-training and skill upgrading is a crucial part of ABB's strategy. At
Zamech, Mr Pawel Olechnowicz, the chief executive, heads a strong Polish
management which enjoys advice and frequent visits from Zurich but is solely
responsible for the plant's performance. Mr Olechnowicz, who once ran the
steel castings department, says: 'Since the company became ABB Zamech the
plant has gained know-how, the management has learned English and the shop
floor has improved work discipline.'
A crucial management tool is direct access to ABB's worldwide sales network
as well as financial backing. He also has the magic ABB label on his
products which eases marketing. But until now, new capital investment has
been relatively light although the medium-term investment plan has a Dollars
50m tag attached to it.
Mr Olechnowicz says Dollars 15m is being invested in the plant. The main
changes have come through better management. The plant has been re-organised
into 'profit centres' with well-defined budgets and tight financial
discipline. Factory space has been cut back and a satellite telephone link
to Zurich has been installed to help head office monitor the company.

FT  28 APR 92 / Survey of Poland (20): A race against time - A privatised
brewery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BOBINSKI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'IT'S GOOD to see people drinking Zywiec,' Mr Adam Loewe says sitting in the
bar in Warsaw's Holiday Inn hotel and watching guests ordering his brewery's
beer. A quiet satisfaction beams from the 33-year-old managing director as
he says it but the feeling is matched by the evident responsibility he feels
for the brewery privatised through a public share offer last summer.
The sale was a success with the 1.5m shares offered to the general public as
well as to larger investors snapped up within days. The offer price of
100,000 zlotys soon rose once the brewery came on to Warsaw's fledgling
stock exchange to its present 178,000 zlotys or so level.
Down at Zywiec in southern Poland where the brewery was founded 136 years
ago by one of the Habsburgs the benefits of privatisation soon came to be
felt.
Wages rose freed of the controls in force throughout the state sector,
management was streamlined and, as Mr Loewe says, people began to see money
in quite a different light.
'Now every zloty invested has to generate profits,' he says comparing the
present favourably with an accountant-free past. Privatisation saw the plant
freed of several taxes still in force in the state sector and net profits
last year soared to 133bn zlotys from 1990's 51.8bn zlotys.
This year the first two months' results suggest that net profits could hit
the 180bn zlotys mark.
But the benefits of privatisation have already been discounted and in a
sense Mr Leowe's problems are now beginning. He has inherited outdated
equipment that is more labour, energy and raw materials intensive than in
breweries in Germany or Denmark. His costs are higher than theirs making him
vulnerable to competition from imports.
The threat will be greater if it were not for a 30 per cent customs tariff
which Mr Leowe is hoping that the government will keep in place. His
longer-term response is to invest in modern equipment enabling him to cut
labour and other costs.
This year his investment budget is set at 120bn zlotys eating up much of
last year's profit. Some of the capital investment will be financed by loans
from abroad but in any event shareholders' dividends this year will be
squeezed, threatening a drop in the share price on the stock exchange.
That, in turn, makes Zywiec vulnerable to a take-over from foreign
competition. At one point in 1990 Heineken expressed an interest in buying
51 per cent of the company. Then the government decided to float it on the
domestic market.
Mr Leowe agrees this was the right thing to do. Even though he comes from
the industrial district of Silesia where he originally worked for Weglokoks,
the state coal trader, he fully identifies with the Zywiec century-old
tradition.
'I wouldn't like to see the name disappear and that could happen if we were
bought up now,' he says.
At present the Zywiec p/e ratio of 2.7 makes the company easy prey should
anyone want to take it over. Mr Leowe, though, is looking to the 20 per cent
of the equity held by management and workers as well as another 10 per cent
held by Invesco Central Europe, a UK-based investment fund, to guard against
such an eventuality.
He sees himself as being in a race against time. He wants to bring the
plant's annual capacity up from the present to 1.2m hectolitres to 2m
hectolitres brewed on modern equipment within the next few years. Then, he
says, he will ready to go into a joint venture with a foreign partner on
more equal terms and retain the Zywiec identity.
'After all,' he says, 'GM bought Adam Opel before the war but the name
remains to this day.'

FT  28 APR 92 / Survey of Poland (19): Fierce competition for big market -
Tangles arise in dispute over car quotas
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BOBINSKI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
POLAND'S mini dispute over car quotas with the European Community is an
example of the tangles that arise when people say one thing and then demand
to be allowed to do another.
In this case it is the western multinationals' lack of commitment to free
trade that seems to have given rise to the problem.
Last year, just as Poland was negotiating its Association Agreement with the
EC aiming at a gradual dismantling of trade barriers in industrial goods,
General Motors Europe, which was negotiating a joint venture with Warsaw's
FSO car plant, was asking the Poles for high customs tariffs as a condition
of going ahead with their investment. As the Poles need both sides, they
persuaded Brussels to accept the 35 per cent tariff on imported cars which
would gradually be removed till the year 2002 but accepted Brussels's
suggestion that 30,000 cars a year would be permitted to come in duty free
from the EC.
That seemed to satisfy GM Europe who are on the verge of agreeing to install
an Astra assembly line at FSO and are promising further investment in years
to come. But it left the thorny problem of how to divide the 30,000 quota
among European car manufacturers, many of whom spent most of last year
preparing to invade a buoyant Polish market which imported more than 300,000
mainly used cars last year.
Finally, the Poles decided to treat the quotas as an added investment
incentive. Thus, those who invested at least Dollars 50m in Poland would get
their fair share. That, for the moment, narrows the list of beneficiaries to
three - GM Europe who are looking at FSO, Fiat Auto of Italy who are
negotiating a joint venture with the FSM plant in southern Poland, and
Volkswagen who are talking seriously of assembling the Toyota pick-up truck
they now make in Hanover in Poznan.
Each, the Polish trade ministry announced, would be able to import 10,000
vehicles duty-free, a concession which could be worth up to Dollars 25m each
a year.
The decision, though, hit the French manufacturers, with Renault, for
example, protesting that it had invested Dollars 50m in its sales network in
Poland, and they got their government to have the car part of the
Association agreement which came into force on March 1 suspended. They also
asked Brussels to talk to the Poles about redesigning the way the quota is
divided. That may take some time and the first meeting in Warsaw was held
almost in secret.
Meanwhile, Peugeot has gone ahead and signed an agreement with the FSC truck
factory in Lublin for assembly of their 405 model beginning in mid-1993.
They expect to assemble 2,000 a year initially, rising to 10,000 in the
fourth year. Kits, it may be added, come in duty-free in any case.

FT  28 APR 92 / Survey of Poland (17): Signs that all is not well - The
impact of private banks on the economy is still very small
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BOBINSKI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DAVID BOGATIN, the Russian-American owner of the FirstCommercial Bank in
Lublin, recently proved that being a banker in Poland requires special
skills. Recently, for several anxious moments he had to harangue a crowd of
anxious depositors from the windows of his head office. Using all his powers
of persuasion he succeeded in calming the crowd and stopping the run on the
bank which was started by newspaper reports that he was being sought by New
York state for tax avoidance.
But subsequent revelations about Mr Bogatin's alleged links with the Mafia
and his incarceration pending extradition to the United States provide a
clear sign that all is not well with Poland's private banking sector.
The number of private banks grew rapidly in 1990 and 1991. There are now
about 80. They benefited from the general political climate favouring the
private sector which helped pressure the NBP, the central bank to issue
licences where its better instinct counselled prudence.
Indeed, Mr Stanislaw Bereza, formerly of Barclays Bank, who headed the NBP's
supervisory section until a few weeks ago, now argues for more caution in
bank licensing. 'There aren't enough experienced people in the country to
run that number of banks,' he says. Western aid schemes to banking tend to
bypass the private sector which needs advice on banking as much as state
banks, he adds.
The bank supervision department is seriously understaffed with just over 60
people to keep an eye on the 80 or so private banks.
This may not yet be as serious as it seems. The impact of the private banks
on the economy is still very small. They handle only 5 per cent of total
personal deposits. But they also sometimes act as 'money shops' for small
groups of people, Mr Bereza says.
In some cases private banks have been involved in transferring funds abroad.
The Art-B company, for example, is estimated to have transferred some
Dollars 200m which the banking authorities are now trying to get back. The
private BHK bank, recently closed down by the central bank, also helped
Art-B conduct its cheque-kiting operation. (This type of operation involves
drawing cheques on an account which does not have sufficient funds and
banking them in a second account. The account-holder then makes use of the
'non-existent' funds in that account before the cheques can be cleared and
dishonoured.)
Some of the private banks, such as the BIG bank, are working to bring their
capital base into line with capital adequacy requirements, and some such as
the Kredytbank whose experienced staff came from the Export Development
Bank, have a growing degree of in-house expertise.
But western bankers in Warsaw tend to give the sector generally a wide
berth, preferring to work with the established banks. 'The private sector is
too small and there's no point in worrying about the risks,' says one.
Indeed, it may be left to Poland's bank privatisation programme to give the
sector the boost it needs. The government expects to raise 1,200bn zlotys
from sales of banking institutions this year. The well-regarded Export
Development Bank is expected to be sold first through a public share offer.
Two other state-owned banks, the Wielkopolski Bank Kredytowy and the Bank
Slaski, are also looking for western investors to take up to a 20 per cent
share.
Government policy is to retain a 30 per cent stake in these two banks
leaving up to 40 per cent to be sold to the general public and 10 per cent
for the staff.
For the moment, though, it is up to the foreign banks in Poland to create
competition for the state sector as well as training staff for Polish banks.
Among foreign banks Citibank and the Dutch NMB bank concentrate on serving
the larger foreign companies as well as Polish corporate clients while
Amerbank, a joint venture which is in effect being run by Banker's Trust,
has developed a retail banking operation to individual clients.
The Austrian Creditanstalt seems to be following suit while Raiffeisen, also
from Austria, is providing a mixture of services. These operations are small
and some are waiting for the telecommunications infrastructure to be put
into place.
The foreign banks are grateful for the new state-owned Polish Development
Bank, which channels World Bank and other foreign funds through to other
banks, because this is helping to develop a money market. But before Poland
has a full-blown private banking sector worthy of confidence it seems likely
more bankers will find themselves like Mr Bogatin, having to plead from
window sills.

FT  28 APR 92 / Survey of Poland (18): A hunter of business gems - Profile
of George Bonar
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN SPITE of its problems Poland still has its fans who insist that, while
not always easy, the country well merits closer attention.
Mr George Bonar, a Polish-born Canadian entrepreneur who is chairman,
president and chief executive officer of International UNP Holdings Ltd, a
Toronto-based, Polish investment fund with CDollars 9.5m capital and an
impressive list of blue-chip international financial shareholders, is one of
its keenest fans.
Over the past few months he has examined around 250 medium-sized Polish
companies. Out of a preliminary short list of 50 he has selected 15 for 'due
diligence' examination.
His board has also recently approved taking a controlling stake in the first
two companies. 'It is our policy to take a stake of over 50 per cent so we
control the shareholders' meeting and the supervisory board and can change
the management if we like.' But, Mr Bonar adds: 'If we didn't like Polish
management we would not have come this far.'
Significantly, the first two acquisitions are companies producing basic
consumer goods which are also dominant in their industry - a common
characteristic of enterprises under the highly monopolistic communist
system.
IBIS in Bydgoszcz, for example, the first of UNP's acquisitions is Poland's
largest bakery equipment maker while Biawar is the largest producer of water
heaters.
To those who despair that Poland's several thousand state-owned
manufacturing companies can ever be turned into modern, profitable,
capitalist enterprises, Mr Bonar, from first-hand experience retorts: 'I
think there are gems among those middle-sized companies with up to 1,000
employees and sales up to Dollars 8-10m.'
Convinced that many of these companies are capable of producing the 35 per
cent return on capital which justifies such a venture capital approach Mr
Bonar adds: 'There are several hundred of these companies and we are going
out to find them. They will be the micro-economic success stories of the
future.'
For Mr Bonar, Poland is going through the sort of historic transition which
opened up such profitable opportunities for post-war investors in Germany,
Japan, Korea and Taiwan. With a highly-skilled and literate labour force,
and a relatively low wage structure, the infusion of capital, technology and
management skills will make almost any business highly competitive, he adds.

FT  28 APR 92 / Survey of Poland (16): Paradise for consultants - The
initial ardour of many would-be investors has cooled
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY ROBINSON and CHRISTOPHER BOBINSKI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
POLAND has become a consultant's paradise as legions of accountants,
merchant bankers, lawyers, company doctors, would-be fund managers and the
like have swarmed all over the country's 8,000 state-owned enterprises and
fledgling financial institutions offering advice - but little money.
Meanwhile, the disruption caused by three governments in quick succession,
bureaucratic delays caused by lack of expertise in a former communist
bureaucracy made worse by low salaries and poaching of talent by foreign
companies and the private sector, have cooled the initial ardour of many
would-be investors.
The government's own figures show that 5,000 joint ventures and
foreign-owned projects with a declared investment value of Dollars 690m were
in place by the end of the year.
This is only a third of the Hungarian level - and Hungary has only a quarter
of Poland's nearly 40m population.
Most investments have been small or medium, with none of the megadeals such
as Volkswagen's takeover of the Skoda car company in Czechoslovakia.
Much painstaking groundwork has been done, however, and this year the pace
should speed up. Much will depend on the outcome of the mass privatisation
scheme due to be launched mid-year.
The rag-bag portfolio of state or municipally-owned enterprises have been
sorted into 36 separate industrial sectors. They are being carefully
analysed by western accountants and merchant bankers before their sale,
privatisation, re-organisation or closure.
More than 30 foreign investment projects are at an advanced stage of
negotiation. In the automotive industry alone, for example, GM Europe is
finalising details of its planned Dollars 75m investment at Warsaw's FSO car
plant as is Fiat with its Dollars 200m auto project at FSM in southern
Poland. Volvo is also negotiating to assemble trucks at the Jelcz plant also
in southern Poland and Peugeot is also negotiating to assemble 405 models in
Lublin.
Poland is also attracting the multinational food and consumer goods
corporations busy carving out market share in everything from packaged foods
to detergents and baby goods.
Strategic investors such as the Swiss-Swedish ABB are also busy building up
capacity and skills for the heavy energy and other infrastructure
investments which will have to take place in the latter part of the decade
and well into the next century.
For all the delays and frustrations, a rapid, if apparently chaotic
transformation of the economy is taking place. The old communist economy
with its heavy emphasis on heavily polluting, inefficient, coal-fired power
plants, iron and steel, heavy engineering, basic chemicals and trade with
eastern Europe and the Soviet Union is in profound crisis.
But some sectors are doing better than others. It still makes sense, for
example, when skilled labour is paid only Dollars 200 a month, to build
ships for export and invest in modernising and raising productivity of the
Baltic shipyards.
A big problem here, in spite of fast-rising official unemployment, is
shortage of labour willing to work under harsh conditions for such wages
deliberately kept low by government policy.

FT  28 APR 92 / Survey of Poland (14): Happy returns on first birthday -
Stock Exchange
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BOBINSKI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WARSAW'S stock exchange, which celebrated its first birthday this month,
remains small, albeit perfectly formed.
It is based on the French order driven system with shares rising and falling
within a 10 per cent band at any one session.
It is computerised and its modern book entry system is designed to protect
investors. Pioneer International Corp from the US, the first foreign
investment fund to get a licence to operate in Poland, say that this was an
important factor which prompted them to get involved.
The exchange and the brokers are policed by the Polish Securities
Commission, which is a full member of the International Organisation of
Securities Regulators and has adopted a US regulatory model. The commission,
headed by Mr Leslaw Paga, demands the highest standards in company
prospectuses and has already suspended several stockbrokers found guilty of
contravening trading rules.
For the moment the exchange trades in 12 stocks including breweries, clothes
and electronics manufacturers. Another 10 are expected to join the list this
year with the first bank, the Export Development Bank (BRE) among them.
Mr Wieslaw Rozlucki, chairman of the stock exchange, is disappointed at the
slow pace of privatisation but the few stocks traded have a high turnover
ratio with 30 to 40 per cent of the stock of most companies changing hands
over the year.
This means that quite a lot of money has been made and lost in the exchange
on the fifth floor of what was once the Communist party headquarters in
downtown Warsaw.
The past 12 months have seen 3.5m shares worth 700bn zlotys traded first at
weekly sessions and lately twice a week.
The 12 quoted shares are capitalised at about Dollars 150m and are
relatively cheap with a lowly p/e ratio of 3 compared, say, to the Budapest
exchange where the ratio is 7. Investors are mostly small savers.
Around 100,000 Poles have bought shares and half of those opened accounts
with the 26 stockbroking offices mostly run by banks which enable them to
buy and sell at will.

FT  28 APR 92 / Survey of Poland (13): New era dawns for consumers -
Christopher Bobinski investigates the rise in foreign trade
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BOBINSKI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LONG lines of lorries at Poland's western frontiers bear eloquent testimony
to the increasingly important role foreign trade is playing in the country's
economy. Over the past two years the availability of formerly unimagined
foreign goods in Polish shops has been one of the most important tangible
signs for ordinary Poles that a new era has dawned.
Exports, too, have taken on a new vitality and export promotion is now at
the heart of the government's strategy for economic growth aided by last
December's association agreement with the European Community. The EC
agreements should see the removal of remaining trade barriers for industrial
goods by the end of the century and easier access for farm goods.
Trade growth has been impressive since the first post-communist government
lowered trade barriers, devalued the zloty and made it internally
convertible in January 1990. The share of imports in GNP grew from 13.6 per
cent in 1989 to 22.8 per cent last year while the share of exports almost
doubled from 9.2 per cent to 15.3 per cent in 1991.
The first half of 1991 saw an explosion of private sector trading. Half of
last year's Dollars 15.5bn imports were brought in by private individuals
and companies and 22 per cent of the Dollars 14.6bn exports were sold by the
private sector.
Germany, an easy car or truck ride away from most Polish cities, was the
source of two-thirds of the private sector's imports and the market for 50
per cent of its exports. At the other extreme the collapse of the Soviet
economy, together with the demise of the transferable rouble and its
replacement by dollar pricing, led to a collapse in trade with the former
Comecon countries to around 10 per cent of turnover last year from 50 per
cent.
Such a rapid collapse has been painful and disruptive. Poland still needs to
import gas and oil from Russia and last year continued to run a deficit with
the former Soviet Union while industries such as textiles, pharmaceuticals
and engineering were left gasping at the disappearance of a market they had
been welded to for more than 40 years.
Even private manufacturers such as Mr Andrzej Czernecki, managing director
of medical instruments company HLT, accuse the post-communist governments of
not doing enough to support trade with the east. Poland's share of the
former Soviet Union's imports shrank from 9 per cent in 1990 to 4 per cent
last year, the largest fall among the former Comecon partners, while the US,
Turkey and even Thailand increased their share of the Soviet market.
The loss of the Soviet market has been partially compensated for by trade
with the EC which bought more than half last year's exports. Thanks to a 29
per cent rise in exports to Dollars 8.3bn, Poland ran up a Dollars 560m
surplus with the EC although imports rose 87.4 per cent to Dollars 7.7bn.
But the unprecedented sharp rise in imports contributed to Poland's overall
Dollars 823m trade deficit last year and provided the background to a debate
about the wisdom of keeping a fixed exchange rate for the zloty in spite of
rising inflation. The resulting zloty appreciation against western
currencies contributed to an unprecedented influx of foreign consumer goods
worth Dollars 4.8bn, 157 per cent more than in 1990.
The flow was partially stemmed by a 17 per cent devaluation in May and
higher customs tariffs in August. In the autumn Mr Leszek Balcerowicz, the
then deputy premier in charge of the economy, was persuaded to introduce a
'crawling peg' devaluation. Until then he remained determined to use an
overvalued zloty to help control inflation and put competitive pressure on
domestic industry.
Imports tightened the pressure on domestic producers and increased political
pressure for aid to industry and a more actively pro-export policy. This was
also advocated by the World Bank which urged that exports should be treated
as the only effective source of increased demand to combat the recession and
that exchange rate policy should be used to stimulate that growth.
The government heeded the message. It approved a 12 per cent devaluation in
February and appears ready to devalue again if needed. At the same time wage
controls are to be tightened to maintain competitive advantage while
depressed internal consumption should also spur manufacturers to look for
markets abroad.
With GATT predicting a 4 per cent increase in world trading volumes this
year, there should be room for the 3 per cent growth in exports for which
the government is budgeting. The EC will be the prime target of this export
drive which will be concentrated on metallurgical goods, furniture and
agricultural products.
This will test Brussels's commitment to a gradual dismantling of trade
barriers as enshrined in Poland's crucial Association Agreement with the EC.
The agreement has yet to be ratified by Poland's parliament where it has its
opponents. Polish steel makers are also well aware that they remain very
much at the mercy of EC producers who can regulate trade through non-tariff
barriers. But the big worry is enforcement of safeguard clauses in the
agreement which permit a reversal of specific free trade promises if Poles
become too successful in EC markets.
