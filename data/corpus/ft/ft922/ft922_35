FT  21 APR 92 / UK Company News: Property; health amid the walking wounded -
Investors may find a pocket of growth in this spiralling sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PENNY shares are one of the property industry's few growth sectors. As the
property market spirals further downwards, the share prices of over half the
quoted sector have been dragged down to under 50p.
The companies in this predicament are a motley crew. Some former high
flyers, such as Rosehaugh at 7p or Speyhawk at 5p only exist courtesy of
their bankers. A larger group has no scope to do anything other than
concentrate on survival.
But a few have healthy balance sheets and the flexibility to outperform the
big companies as the market recovers. This sub-group of small property
companies may prove a genuine growth sector.
The handful of robust companies among the ranks of walking wounded attracts
relatively little attention. Stockbrokers tend to focus their attention on
the six largest companies on the market, which account for two-thirds of the
quoted sector's value.
Moreover, it is hard to drum up enthusiasm for any property company in the
wake of a stream of bad news about the sector, most notably the
restructuring talks of Olympia &amp; York, the world's largest property
developer.
For all that, some companies deserve further scrutiny - even though their
share prices may not rise until sentiment improves concerning commercial
property. A few have managed to increase their profits and net assets,
despite operating in tough markets. Last year, eight property companies,
mainly those with low gearing, outperformed the stockmarket with share price
increases of over 15 per cent.
Investors interested in small property companies should look for three
characteristics.
First, skilled management, which has been able to read the market correctly.
Kleinwort Benson Securities, the City broker, cites Burford Holdings as an
example. It sold property at the peak of the property cycle to eradicate its
borrowings. It has since bought a clutch of properties outside London at
distressed prices.
But the few companies which timed their disposals correctly are in select
company. 'It is extremely difficult to find smaller companies which did not
think it necessary to expand very aggressively during the boom,' says Mr
Martin Barber, chairman of Capital &amp; Regional Properties, which sold half
its UK property in 1998.
Managements with deal-making flair or fee-earning potential also have
something extra to offer. For instance, English &amp; Overseas Property, the
former property arm of Pentos, is able to cover its management costs with
fees earned by helping banks unscramble their property problems.
Second, a well-spread portfolio. Many of the best-placed companies are those
with portfolios outside Central London, which has been particularly badly
hit by the property recession.
One example, which also benefits from sound finances, is Town Centre
Securities, which has a bias towards retail property in the north of
England. 'It has not put a foot wrong,' says one analyst.
The inclusion of London property does not always deter investors. Derwent
Valley Holdings is credited for good work in sweating its assets, despite
the concentration of its portfolio in the difficult west end market.
Third, sound finance. The best-placed companies are perhaps those with no
borrowings, such as the conservatively-managed Frogmore Estates.
But some gearing will help companies make the most of a turn in the market.
And even companies with significant borrowings may have room for manoeuvre
because net rents virtually cover its interest costs.
Capital &amp; Regional Properties, for instance, has gearing of 73 per cent. But
it has been able to double its UK portfolio at a cost of Pounds 20m, with
buildings that yield enough to cover the interest costs.
The importance of strong finances can hardly be overstated at a time when
many companies have difficulty in raising new money.
Those with weak balance sheets are unable to borrow for expansion. And as
they usually have low share prices, well under their net asset value, any
attempt to raise money by issuing shares would severely dilute the net asset
value.
For many of these companies the rental income does not cover the interest
and administration costs, which are often inflated by exaggerated salaries.
'It is only a matter of time before institutional investors start to ask
questions of directors', say property brokers at Kleinwort Benson
Securities.
The logical answer to excessive administration charges is the consolidation
of the sector. Mergers would also increase the share capital to a size where
it would be far more marketable, with lower spreads between bid and offer
price. Another point in favour of deal-makers is that capital gains tax
liabilities have shrunk to nothing in many cases.
So far, corporate activity has been limited to Southend Property's failed
attempt to buy Frogmore Estates; TR Property Investment Trusts' successful
Pounds 17m bid for New England Properties and Hemingway's reversal into
Marylebone Estate Company. Although Hemingway is still loss-making, analysts
think the management team could be one to watch.
The reason there has been little corporate activity so far is partly that
asset values have not stopped falling and potential bidders are worried
about 'black holes' in their accounts. It is also difficult to persuade
managements to agree to a merger which could leave them out of a job. 'It is
difficult to put two entrepreneurs together, unless one is willing to walk
away,' says an analyst.
Unless and until there is some corporate activity amongst the smaller
companies in the sector, the prospects for most small quoted property
companies are decidedly unexciting. Scores of washed-up companies could
remain stranded until they expire, merge or are swept up by the tide of the
next property boom.

FT  21 APR 92 / Hanson appoints chief executive
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HANSON, the Anglo-American conglomerate, is to appoint Mr Derek Bonham,
finance director, in the new post of chief executive, only two months after
Lord Hanson told shareholders he did not intend to appoint a successor.
The move follows the decision of Lord White, chairman of Hanson Industries
in the US, to appoint Mr David Clarke, president of Hanson's US arm, in the
role of deputy chairman.
One of Hanson's advisers said Lord Hanson, who has traditionally spent more
time managing the businesses than looking for the acquisitions, wanted to
have a more 'hands off' role within the group and decided to appoint a chief
executive. 'Although Lord Hanson will still want to know the group's bank
balance every week he has decided to have a more wide ranging role in the
group.'
While Lord Hanson does not plan to call Mr Bonham his successor that is how
it is likely to be interpreted by those outside the group.
Mr Bonham, aged 48, masterminded Hanson's complicated tax policy that
resulted in the group paying one of the lowest corporation tax charges of
any company in the FT-SE 100.
His appointment is likely to be seen as a disappointment for Mr Tony
Alexander, chief operating office in the UK, who has been seen as Lord
Hanson's number two.
Mr William Landuyt, chief financial officer in the US, will replace Mr
Bonham as finance director.

FT  21 APR 92 / Midland investors may not keep HSBC bonds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MANY OF the bonds which Hongkong and Shanghai Bank plans to issue as part of
the consideration for the purchase of Midland Bank are likely to be dumped
in the market soon after the takeover, Midland shareholders and bond market
professionals said.
If a substantial proportion of the bonds were to be sold by Midland
shareholders, it would depress the price and could clog up the market in
sterling subordinated bank debt, driving down the price of other bank paper.
The bonds' estimated value will factor into institutions' calculations of
the value of the bid for Midland by HSBC Holdings, Hongkong and Shanghai
Bank's parent. Taking the bonds at par value, the all-paper share and bond
offer was worth 396p on Thursday, the most recent trading day in Hong Kong.
Midland's share price languished on Thursday at 362p, indicating shareholder
dissatisfaction with the offer's terms.
M&amp;G, the unit trust group which owns around 6 per cent of Midland's shares,
said last week it would be likely to sell the bonds quickly. 'There is not
really a natural home for that (paper), particularly not with us,' M&amp;G said.
Other UK institutions also said they did not normally hold subordinated debt
issued by banks, and were unlikely to keep the bonds.
HSBC has said it will issue between Pounds 352m-Pounds 704m of bonds,
depending on the proportion of shares and bonds Midland shareholders elect
to receive. Even the lower figure would amount to the largest-ever sterling
bond issue by a bank.
HSBC's advisers expect domestic UK investors to sell the bonds and foreign
investors to buy. No decision has yet been taken on whether there will be
advanced marketing of the bonds to potential overseas investors.
The margin on the bonds, at 1.6 percentage point rounded up or down to the
nearest  1/8 per cent, compares favourably with a margin of around 0.6 on
similar paper issued by Barclays and National Westminster Bank. However,
HSBC is considered a poorer credit, making it less attractive to investors.
IBCA, the UK rating agency, said the bank's AA- grade was now under review
and could fall if the Midland takeover is completed.

FT  21 APR 92 / The Lex Column: HSBC/Midland
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Hongkong Bank's reluctance to part with cash and its desire to avoid
excessive dilution made the issue of loan stock an obvious choice for
financing part of its bid for Midland. The resulting issue of between Pounds
350m and Pounds 700m of 10-year subordinated debt would be a large morsel,
however, for a market that saw only Pounds 335m of such paper from banks
last year and has already absorbed Pounds 250m in 1992. That prompts the
question of how marketable HSBC's paper would be.
Large issues normally command a liquidity premium in the bond market. Such
an advantage would already apply to an issue of Pounds 350m, but is likely
to be steadily whittled away as the amount increases towards the top of the
range envisaged by HSBC. Despite the rush into gilts since the election,
subordinated bank debt is not a favourite of international investors. There
is not much appetite from other banks, because the investment has a high
risk weighting under BIS rules.
Doubtless HSBC's advisers took this into account when setting the margin on
the bonds at 160 basis points over comparable gilt-edged stock. That looked
generous compared with the 145-point margin offered by the Woolwich Building
Society on a Pounds 50m issue just before the bid terms were announced. It
still looks broadly in line with the market, even though spreads on similar
issues have widened by about 5 points since then. Whether the promised par
price would hold for long is another matter. One has to assume that holders
of Midland equity are not necessarily natural investors in fixed rate
subordinated bank bonds. Many will want to sell their holdings quickly. It
is hard to see demand being overwhelming, even though supply of other issues
may now dry up while the bid proceeds.

FT  21 APR 92 / The Lex Column: Boardrooms
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The myth that Britain's building companies are conservatively managed was
blown to bits last week. Sometimes conservatively accounted, perhaps. But
the dreadful results of Taylor Woodrow and Tarmac were gruesome testimony to
the way they and most of their peers blundered through the recession with
the same expansionist strategies which made them stock market darlings in
the late 1980s.
The reckoning has arrived, as shown by such boardroom changes as the
departure of Taylor Woodrow's chairman Mr Peter Drew and the promotion to
chief executive of Tarmac's Mr Neville Simms. For investors, the questions
to ponder now are how well management teams in the sector are equipped to
face the different challenges of the 1990s and how far they are prepared to
make difficult decisions about capital allocation once the grim task of
retrenchment is complete. Alternatively, are these apparently new-look
boardrooms merely the product of shuffling the old pack?
New thinking among housebuilders and contractors is hard to find, although
the decisive manner in which Mr Andrew Teare turned his back on
housebuilding after arriving at ECC stands out. The ratings of Redland and
Blue Circle among building material companies have been improved by new
boardroom blood - Redland effecting a complete generational change - though
ironically it was the old soldiers at RMC Group who impressed the market
with better than expected figures last week.
Calls for better corporate governance notwithstanding, too many
institutional investors seem to have waited for disasters and then jumped
ship. Having been slow to tackle the contractors, they might perhaps make
amends by calling for heads among the insurers and the banks.

FT  21 APR 92 / The Lex Column: When cash flow is king
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The flood of annual reports from UK companies in the past few weeks has
confronted investors with a new phenomenon: the cash flow statement. If they
are slightly puzzled over what to do with it, they cannot wholly be blamed.
The old source and application of funds, which the cash flow statement
replaces, was largely ignored by investors. This was chiefly because its
content was so loosely defined that companies could use it to prove what
they liked. The point about the cash flow statement, though, is that its
more rigid format makes the bad news harder to hide.
Its simplest and most useful application is to check the quality of profits.
The profit and loss account does not concern itself with cash going out of
the business to finance working capital. It thus does not address the
question of whether stocks are worth what was paid for them, or whether
debtors are good for repaying their debts: or whether the outflow can be
financed. The quick way to determine whether this is an issue is to compare
operating profit with operating cash flow.
Last year, for instance, ICI had trading profits of Pounds 1bn and operating
cash flow of Pounds 1.5bn. Hanson had trading profits of Pounds 941m and
operating cash flow of Pounds 934m. In both cases, no problem. British
Aerospace, on the other hand, had operating profits of Pounds 354m and
operating cash flow of minus Pounds 95m, which makes its surprise rights
issue in the latter part of the year rather more intelligible.
The most extreme case of this is Polly Peck. Its farewell set of accounts
showed pre-tax profits up 44 per cent to Pounds 161m. Its source and
application of funds statement showed funds generated from operations of
Pounds 172m. But a new-style cash flow statement, as calculated by County
NatWest, would have shown an operating cash outflow of Pounds 129m, chiefly
because of a staggering Pounds 288m increase in working capital.
On the other hand, the figure of Pounds 288m was clearly displayed in Polly
Peck's source and application of funds. This suggests what is in fact the
case: that the novelty of the cash flow statement lies not so much in
disclosure as in presentation. As the example shows, presentation can be
vital. That suggests in turn that most investors have been too busy or too
slothful to dissect the accounts for themselves.
But that is partly because British financial statements, the balance sheet
included, had become so corrupted as often to be meaningless. The overhaul
of the system, when complete, will mean that investors can no longer allow
themselves to settle for single crude yardsticks such as earnings per share.
It also means that the spivvier kind of company will have to devise fresh
ways of hiding the truth. The extent to which the latter succeeds in time
for the next boom will be the chief test of whether the new Accounting
Standards Board has the stamina for the job.

FT  21 APR 92 / Gatt plan is forecast to boost world tradeby Dollars 195bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WORLD SALES of goods and services would rise by Dollars 195bn (Pounds 110bn)
a year within a decade if measures planned in the Gatt talks were adopted,
says a report * published today by the OECD Development Centre, the
Paris-based economic research unit.
Member states of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development
stand to gain the most, with sub-Saharan Africa the biggest loser. Developed
countries would still be net beneficiaries even after compensating the
losers, says the report.
The 10-year forecasts are based on an OECD/World Bank computer model of
global production and trade which evaluated three options: no change in
tariffs, a 30 per cent reduction, roughly what is being considered in the
protracted Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, and
the removal of all barriers to trade.
In this last case, annual world income is forecast to be Dollars 477bn
higher than it would otherwise be in 2002, a gain worth more than the entire
income of China, says the report. With agriculture at the centre of the Gatt
talks, the report criticises protectionism as 'inefficient for supporting
farm incomes'. It says that 60 per cent of the cost of protectionism fails
to reach farmers, and recommends direct income support with other targeted
assistance instead.
Cutting tariffs by 30 per cent would raise the world price for cereals.
While this would hurt net food importers, including much of Africa, what
matters is their 'economic power to grow or buy food - rather than the
national level of agricultural production'.
The losses of food importers could be balanced by a transfer of Dollars 7bn,
which is 3.5 per cent of the developed world's gains from falling tariffs
and equivalent to less than 20 per cent of official development assistance.
Growth in world grain production would fall slightly to 2.95 per cent a
year. The share of wheat production of the US and the EC would decline, with
the gap being filled by Latin America, the former Soviet Union and poor
Asian and African countries.
The 30 per cent cut in tariffs would 'induce structural changes in virtually
all regions', the report adds. Rural parts of OECD countries would see a
real 7 per cent fall in gross domestic product, while urban areas would see
a real increase of 0.3 per cent.
Similar shifts would occur in high-income parts of Asia and in the Gulf
region, although the picture in developing countries is more complicated.
Rural regions of Africa and India would benefit while those in low-income
Asia would do less well than towns and cities because of local tariff
structures.
The full liberalisation model yields much sharper changes. Real rural GDP in
OECD member states would be 21 per cent lower than if tariffs did not
change. But this would be more than offset by a rise of 1 per cent in urban
GDP, says the report.

Mensbrugghe, available free after May 26 from OECD Development Centre, 94

FT  21 APR 92 / NUT rejects call to boycott teacher appraisal scheme
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE National Union of Teachers pulled back yesterday from becoming the first
union to confront Mr John Major's re-elected government.
Amid bitter and confused scenes, the union's annual conference at Blackpool
rejected by 97,444 to 72,360 a left-wing call to boycott the appraisal of
teachers. The policy is already being implemented across much of the
country.
The union decided instead to seek, jointly with other teacher unions, to
negotiate acceptable schemes with local education authorities.
Under government plans, all teachers are to be appraised by senior members
of school staff by September 1994 and regularly thereafter. Ministers insist
 -to the NUT's dismay - that appraisal ratings should play a part in the
award of performance-related pay. A scheme will be drawn up next year by the
teachers' pay and conditions review body.
The vote on appraisal was one of a series of brinks from which the
182,000-strong NUT - the largest and most militant of Britain's teacher
unions - pulled back at Blackpool. On Saturday, it narrowly rejected a
motion committing the union to boycott the government's national tests for
seven and 14-year-olds.
Mr Doug McAvoy, NUT general secretary, and his embattled executive are
relieved to have avoided commitments to engage in strikes and boycotts.
Motions due for debate today - notably a call for action to limit class
sizes - could still involve conflict with the government.
Whatever the votes, Mr John Patten, the new education secretary, is set to
maintain his Conservative predecessors' stance of studied indifference to
the NUT. Appreciation of that has influenced the conference, with the
union's executive repeatedly urging delegates not to expose individual
teachers to the threat of dismissal or disciplinary action for defying
policies the government is determined to implement.
Yesterday's vote was also motivated by concern not to isolate the NUT from
its more moderate rivals which are steadily gaining members at the NUT's
expense. 'It is crucial that this union sticks with every other teacher
union,' Ms Anne Moran, for the executive, told delegates. Fewer than half of
all teachers now belong to the NUT. The AMMA and NASUWT teacher unions have,
respectively, some 40,000 and 60,000 members fewer than NUT; both have
adopted a pragmatic attitude to appraisal, testing and opting-out.
Mr Maurice Littlewood, president of the NASUWT, told the opening session of
his union's conference at Scarborough yesterday that appraisal was likely to
be a 'crude determinant for performance-related pay'. He called for the
assessment of 'whole-school performance' instead. He said: 'A collegiate
staffing structure is a more appropriate guarantee for the delivery of
improvement.'

FT  21 APR 92 / Ousted Afghan leader set to leave for India: Guerrilla
groups claim control of almost all cities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, ISLAMABAD
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PREPARATIONS were under way last night for ousted president Najibullah to
leave Afghanistan after spending five days under the shelter of the United
Nations.
The Indian government said arrangements had been made for Najibullah to
arrive in New Delhi, but could not say when or whether he would do so. In
Kabul, Mr Benon Sevan, special representative of UN secretary-general Mr
Boutros Boutros Ghali, said negotiations were continuing to allow Najibullah
to leave.
Mujahideen guerrillas claimed to control all major cities except Kabul, the
capital, as the transfer of power from government forces to rebel groups
continued.
No violence was reported as government forces attempted to strike deals with
the guerrillas they have been fighting for 13 years.
Officials in Kabul told Reuters news agency that the city of Jalalabad, east
of the capital, was still in government control but its commander was
negotiating the formation of a coalition with the rebels. Kandahar, a key
southern city, was in the hands of a coalition of mujahideen guerrillas and
the local commander.
Najibullah, the formerly Soviet-backed leader, was toppled last week by his
own generals and ministers as government forces' resistance to the advancing
guerrillas crumbled. He tried to leave on Thursday but was turned back by
troops at Kabul airport.
After his removal, Najibullah was denounced by his former close associate,
Mr Abdul Wakil, the foreign minister, as a hated dictator who must be handed
over to the law.
Mr Sevan has been seeking for months to arrange the peaceful transfer of
power from Najibullah to a council including mujahideen representatives.
Talks on the composition of such a council are still going on in Peshawar,
Pakistan, where many guerrilla groups are based.
Diplomats in Kabul believed the ruling Watan party had decided that it would
not oppose the formation of a mujahideen government as long as it was not
dominated by hardline Islamic fundamentalists led by Mr Gulbuddin Hekmatyar.
By negotiating, the party hoped to retain some influence.
Mr Hekmatyar yesterday warned that his Hezb-i-Islami guerrilla group would
attack Kabul unless the government capitulated by April 26. His forces are
massed to the south of the capital.
Those loyal to Mr Ahmad Shah Masood, a rival leader, are mainly to the
north. Mr Wakil said Mr Masood had given an assurance his forces would not
attack Kabul while talks with him were in progress.
A Pakistani government official said, however, that Mr Masood had sent
messages to mujahideen leaders in Pakistan, telling them that he remained
committed to setting up a mujahideen government in Kabul, and had no
intention of joining members of Najibullah's regime.
The Pakistan government announced that Mr Boutros Ghali, would arrive in
Islamabad on Friday on a two-day visit for discussions on the situation in
Afghanistan.

FT  21 APR 92 / Observer: Hanson's choice
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Meanwhile, it sounds as if Sir Owen Green's arch rival, Lord Hanson, is
tinkering with his top management team again. After Lord White's surprise
promotion of 50-year-old David Clarke to be chief executive of Hanson
Industries in the US, Hanson has promoted Derek Bonham, 48, to be chief
executive of the UK end of the business.
The choice of Bonham for the job should help to curb City concerns about the
next generation of Hanson management. Even so it could be a brave move.
Unlike Clarke, who was already one of Hanson's two chief operating officers,
Bonham is a finance man. While it is no great surprise that he has
leapfrogged Martin Taylor, one of the two vice-
chairmen, it is odd that UK chief operating officer Tony Alexander no longer
seems in line for the topmost job.

If anyone doubts that there are still some big and successful businesses in
Britain that do not pay their directors loadsamoney, a glance at BTR's
annual report is reassuring.
Chairman Sir Owen Green's salary of Pounds 216,812 might sound a lot, but it
is relatively modest for the boss of a company with sales of near Pounds 7bn
and a 140,000 workforce. Six of his eight UK directors are paid less than
Pounds 80,000; the highest paid director earned Pounds 254,000; and only one
other made more than Pounds 200,000. The company made no political
contributions and increased its charitable contributions by 29 per cent last
year. For a company which does not believe in having non-executive directors
on its board, it is remarkably well behaved.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Ken Moses and Albert Wheeler, two British Coal old-timers, are just two
nationalised industry types who must be heaving a sigh of relief at the
election result.
A few weeks before the election, both were offered the job of joint deputy
chairmen of British Coal by John Wakeham, the outgoing energy secretary.
However, with the election campaign in full swing and with Labour victory
prospects rising, Wakeham decided to seek the endorsement of Labour's Frank
Dobson, the shadow energy secretary. Dobson flatly refused because, he says,
they were 'suitable only for a government that wants to run down and
privatise the coal industry and close it down'.
So the appointments were put on hold until after the election. Dobson's
hostility to them was an echo of the 1984/85 miners' strike during which
they played a robust role in getting miners to return to work. Both men have
had a key hand in modernising the coal industry, but Dobson's savage
response is a reminder that after 13 years of Tory rule it wasn't only
politicians' jobs that were on the line if the voting had gone the other
way.

In a TV interview last week William Waldegrave, new chancellor of the Duchy
of Lancaster, expatiated on the friendly atmosphere and team spirit of the
Major cabinet. 'People call it collegiate,' he said, 'but actually colleges
aren't like that. I used to be on the governing body of one, and there was a
lot of backbiting. . . .'
The college in question was, of course, All Souls, Oxford, where Waldegrave
did come in for some snide remarks from other fellows for his low attendance
record, as political or business engagements often kept him away. Quite the
least forgiving among his then colleagues, as it happens - going so far on
one occasion as to call Waldegrave a 'pot-hunter' - was one Robert Jackson,
now MP for Wantage and the junior minister in Waldegrave's new department.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Is too much fuss being made of Michael Heseltine's decision to call himself
president of the Board of Trade? After all it is not a real board. He can't
appoint any vice-presidents, the Archbishop of Canterbury no longer attends,
and - unlike Lord Halifax who colonised Nova Scotia - Heseltine cannot
expect to have cities named after him.
True, he can restore his own office to its former title of the President's
Room. But the Foreign Office and the Treasury long ago usurped most of the
old board of trade's real powers.
Since it digested the Ministries of Production, Supply and Materials after
the Second World War, it has lost far more influence than it has gained.
There was even a time when the BoT president was also responsible for social
security, transport, education, and employment. So much work in the
political jungle faces Heseltine if he wants to re-establish his new domain
as a force in the land.
History is not on his side. The average tenure of presidents of the board of
trade over the last two centuries is a shade over two years. Although a
stint in the job did no harm to the careers of Gladstone, Lloyd George,
Churchill, Wilson, and Heath, they are exceptions. Of Heseltine's dozen
predecessors, just three remain MPs - John Biffen, Paul Channon and Peter
Lilley - and only Lilley hangs on to his cabinet seat.
One has to go back more than a century to find presidents of the board of
trade who really left their mark. Perhaps the most notable of them was
William Huskisson, who in the 1820s did a lot to win over protectionist Tory
merchants to the free trade cause. He was also a great supporter of the
development of railways.
Even so, Heseltine would be ill advised to follow too closely in the
Huskisson's footsteps. His most famous achievement was also a fatal one. He
strayed into the path of Stephenson's Rocket on its inaugural run between
Manchester and Liverpool.

FT  21 APR 92 / Leading Article: A house for arts and sport
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CREATION of a Ministry for the National Heritage is in many ways a
natural extension of Mr John Major's desire to preside over a country 'at
ease with itself'. As the nation spends more time at leisure, it is
reasonable that the activities of the central government, so far as they are
necessary, should be brought together under one roof.
Until now, the approach of successive British governments has been
piecemeal: a ministry for the arts, occasionally upgraded, a minister for
sport, sometimes more visible than at others, and broadcasting kept with the
Home Office. Other departments had a say, including education, environment
and even defence, as well as the Scottish and Welsh offices. When it came to
the saving of a national treasure, it was not always clear who was in
command or indeed who defined what a national treasure was.
Mr David Mellor's new office should help to produce clarity. It should be
remembered, however, that the establishment of a new department of state has
not always proved easy. It can lead to inter-departmental rivalries and does
not always attract the best civil servants. The department of economic
affairs was set up with great fanfare by Harold Wilson in the mid-1960s, but
quickly faded away.
Showpiece department
Mr Mellor's first task, therefore, with the prime minister behind him, is to
show that the new ministry is here to stay. It will need to be properly
housed and properly staffed and not reserved, say, for civil servants
unlikely to make it to the top of the Treasury. It should set out in time to
become one of the showpieces of any competent British government, for -
however indirectly - its activities will affect the lives of the people
quite as much as do those of any other department.
Precisely because it is new, the ministry has the opportunity to get its
priorities right from the start. Despite the understandable complaints from
those directly involved in writing and performing, the state of the arts in
Britain is not all that bad. The two leading subsidised theatres in London
frequently perform to packed houses, and there is a wealth of talent in the
regions. British sport may not be the best in the world, but usually manages
to be represented in international competitions, if not to win. British
broadcasting (not only the BBC) is often envied from abroad.
Fragile financing
The problem is that so much of the financing is touch and go. Commercial
sponsorship of the arts, as an additional source of revenue, may have
reached its peak even before the current recession set in. Standards of
English cricket may have declined because there is less of it in schools and
the local authorities lack the funds to provide the facilities while
teachers have become less willing to stay behind after school hours.
Meanwhile, there are repeated arguments about how far resources should come
from national or regional bodies. The Arts Council is still in the throes of
such a dispute. There is also the valid point that if funds are spread
widely, they are spread too thin - perhaps to the detriment of the great
national companies. No one has yet found the perfect solution.
Mr Mellor and his ministry have the chance to look at all these questions
anew. They should be in no hurry to reach conclusions. One principle,
however, should be paramount. The ministry is there to provide a framework
for the support of cultural and sporting activities in Britain. It is not
there to run them. The system of using arms length bodies, such as the Arts
Council, to make the detailed allocations should be kept. Equally, on
broadcasting Mr Mellor has time to examine all the possibilities for the
future well ahead of the expiry of the BBC's charter in 1996 and to do so
without prejudice.
For the arts and sports in general he may even provide more money.
Government funding of the arts has risen under the Conservatives, but only
from 0.15 per cent of general government spending in 1978-79 to 0.19 per
cent in 1988-89. That is not enough for the kind of society Mr Major
obviously wants.

FT  21 APR 92 / Wider choice in the marketplace: John Willman examines the
shake-up in the provision of UK public services
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
With the election of a fourth-term Conservative government, Britain's public
services look set for the biggest shake-up since the post-war Labour
government created the modern welfare state.
In the last parliament, fundamental reforms were launched in services such
as health, education, housing and care of the elderly. Plans were laid for
contracting out more of the work of central and local government to the
private sector. The Citizen's Charter promised a new relationship between
users and providers of public services.
But progress in most of these measures was slow - not least because many
working in the public services were waiting to see whether they would be
reversed by a change of government. Now, the return of a Tory government
with a majority clears the way for the pace of change to accelerate.
The reforms will revolutionise the provision of Britain's public services.
By the time of the next election, most services will largely be delivered by
independent, competing providers under contract to central and local
government.
Government will play a strategic role, acting as a regulator rather than
being closely involved in the management of services. The customer will be
encouraged to use new rights and entitlements to choose between competing
providers and to demand better services.
The government will continue as the main source of funding for Britain's
public services. But in the debate over the quality of those services, the
individual user will increasingly be in the driving seat.
The reforms are most advanced in the National Health Service (NHS) and
education, where opposition has been deeply rooted among the professionals.
In the NHS, there will be a surge in the numbers of hospitals seeking
independent trust status. An additional 99 trust hospitals joined last
year's first-wave pioneers on April 1 and the Department of Health is
already preparing further hospitals, community and ambulance services for
trust status in 1993. Within the next two to three years the self-governing
trust, operating with its own board outside health authority control, can be
expected to become the normal method of local management throughout the NHS.
GP fundholding, under which family doctors hold budgets and purchase
hospital care on behalf of their patients, is also growing. The 300
practices which became fundholders in 1991 were joined by another 250
practices on April 1, so that fundholding already covers 15 per cent of the
population.
Currently confined to big practices, the minimum list size needed for GPs to
qualify as fundholders will drop from 9,000 to 7,000 patients from next
year. The services covered by the fundholding scheme will be extended next
year to health visiting and district nursing. And with experiments designed
to allow even the smallest practice to purchase services on behalf of
patients, fundholding will become the norm within a few years.
Once that happens, it will be the family doctor who becomes the linchpin of
the NHS, commissioning health care and choosing hospitals in the internal
market. The district health authorities will wither away, leaving the
regional health authorities to dispense money to the fundholders and provide
finance for trusts where needed.
In education, only 200 schools have so far opted out of local education
authority (LEA) control for grant-maintained status. But many of the 5,000
secondary schools in England and Wales are now likely to follow suit. At
present, the incentives to opt out are considerable. Apart from freedom from
LEA interference, grant-maintained schools are allocated a share of the
LEA's administration budget to spend on extra teachers, buildings, materials
or whatever the governors wish.
With individual schools now receiving resources largely in proportion to the
number of pupils they attract, schools will increasingly compete as
independent units in the marketplace for pupils. More schools will opt for
selective entry or specialise in other ways, such as the city technology
colleges.
The LEA will shrink to an 'educator of last resort' and local education
ombudsman. Functions such as inspection, which it now provides to schools,
will be bought in from the private sector.
In local government, services such as refuse removal and street cleaning are
already subject to compulsory competitive tendering (CCT) where the council
workforce has to compete against bids from private contractors. But CCT is
to be extended to core town hall functions such as collection of local
taxes, architecture and planning.
At present, four out of five contracts put out to tender are won by the
council workforce. But even when the work stays in-house, the process of
tendering for it is revolutionary, for it turns the council workforce into a
semi-independent organisation, which needs to win contracts to survive.
Much more council housing is likely to pass out of local authority ownership
through transfers to housing associations and action trusts. Councils may
retain the right to nominate people for tenancies, but will surrender the
management of rented housing to the voluntary sector which can more easily
raise finance for ation.
The separation of purchasing and provision is set to be extended next year
into the care of the elderly and handicapped, with the introduction of the
community care reforms. Local authorities will become responsible for
purchasing care, but will buy services from a wide range of providers: the
voluntary and private sectors, as well as their own social services
departments.
The cumulative effect of all these developments will be to turn the local
authority into a purchaser of services on behalf of the community,
increasingly distanced from their provision. This will allow it to
concentrate on improving standards rather than on its responsibilities as an
employer or landlord.
A similar revolution in separating purchasing and provision of public
services is under way in central government. Many Civil Service functions
have been reorganised into executive agencies - separate organisations with
management autonomy which contract with government departments to deliver
services such as the payment of benefits and running jobcentres.
Competitive tendering will expose more of the Civil Service to the pressures
already the norm in local government. Some government support services such
as security, photocopying and cleaning have been contracted out. But a much
wider range of clerical, administrative and professional functions is to be
opened to competition.
All government departments have now submitted to the Treasury details of
work they intend to put out to tender in the summer. In the Inland Revenue,
for example, this covers more than one in four of its 65,000 jobs.
By the next election, the slimline government departments which will be left
could concentrate on policymaking and managing the contracts under which the
work is done.
Perhaps only in public transport are such initiatives lagging behind. But it
is possible to discern the emergence of a similar outcome from the
government's watered-down plans for privatising British Rail. With outright
privatisation now rejected, only BR's freight operations will be sold off.
However, private sector operators will be allowed to run trains on BR's
tracks, and train services will be franchised out to the private sector.
Ultimately, BR could be left with little other than the tracks, which
private operators pay to use.
If road pricing were introduced so that road transport operators also had to
pay for the use of the infrastructure, all services would effectively be in
the private sector competing on all fours. Public transport would be
provided by private operators who would receive subsidies to run loss-making
but socially desirable services.
Over the next five years, public services will be increasingly bought in
from private contractors; public sector organisations will increasingly be
expected to behave like and compete with private companies. The divide
between the public and private sector will blur and become largely
irrelevant.
Government's role will also change, as it withdraws from the day-to-day
management of public services. Instead it will assume a regulatory role,
guarding the public interest on matters such as service quality, prices
(where there are charges) and competition.
It will encourage the establishment of a direct consumer relationship
between the users of public services and the providers through the Citizen's
Charter. This requires each service to provide its customers with details
about quality. Information will be published on the performance of services
through league tables and other means. And they will be forced to offer
redress - including cash compensation - when targets are not met.
The aim is to turn the user into a consumer operating in a public services
marketplace with competing providers to choose between and the power to
punish them when performance falls below standard.
It is an ambitious programme. If it succeeds, it could lead to a
depoliticisation of the public services, in the same way that the
privatisation of utilities such as gas, water and BT has taken them out of
the political arena. Just as voters no longer appear to hold the government
responsible for the service failures of the utilities, they may feel that
shortcomings in health and education are the fault of individual hospitals
and schools, rather than the health service or state education.
Such hopes may be premature, attractive though they would be from the
government's point of view. While there is scope to improve the quality of
public services within their existing budgets, significant improvements in
some services will require additional resources. In the end, the government
cannot abjure responsibility for public services so long as it is the main
source of their funding.
None the less, the reforms will change the UK's public services beyond
recognition as well as the terms of debate over those services. The argument
will now move on from who is to provide public services to the nature and
quality of the services to be provided.

Political analyses of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), in
particular of relations between its most powerful member, Russia, and the
smaller republics, regions and provinces, suffer from one fundamental flaw:
commentators have assumed that the latter are stable.
This is not the case. In many respects, the future of the republics is
insecure. There is both internal unrest within individual CIS members and
open external hostility between some of them. Bloody clashes have erupted
between Moldova, Gagauz, and the Dniestre republic (in the territory of the
former Moldavia); in Belorussia, radicals are demanding the dissolution of
their present parliament.
But even if we suppose that the smaller new states are fortresses of
stability, the region's geopolitical future is still hazy because of the
uncertainty over the future of the Russian federation itself.
In recent months the following examples of tension have emerged between the
Russian federation and its territories:
the territory of Krasnoyarsk intends to proclaim itself a republic;
more republics have declared the supremacy of their laws over the laws of
the Russian federation;
Tatarstan announced a referendum on the independent status of the republic.
In the past year several autonomous republics of the former Soviet Union
have proclaimed their sovereignity while a number of administrative
territories have declared their wish to acquire the status of republics.
National self-determination is clearly being supplemented with regional
identities.
In many more cases, regions and provinces are not merely making dramatic
gestures by proclaiming themselves republics but are simply adopting a
selective approach to relations with Moscow. They carry out only those
federal decisions that coincide with what they were going to do anyway.
Two developments have provoked these devolutionist sentiments. First, local
bosses of political and economic institutions expected strong leadership
from the Russian administration, but they have been disappointed. Second, in
the transition to a market economy, local bosses want to control and
distribute resources themselves.
The former command system of economic relations between the centre and the
provinces has now been replaced by a more democratic 'give and take' system.
However, under this arrangement, republics will not be treated seriously if
they only take and not give; this is the present position of Moscow.
If this pattern continues, republics, regions and territories will ignore
Moscow and other capitals and build their own relations with other elements
of the former Soviet Union and with the outside world. Indeed, when these
relations are based on commerce this may be a healthy process.
'If Boris Yeltsin is quarelling with Dudaev (the president of the Chechen
republic which is not recognised by Russia), this is their problem. My
business with the Chechens continues as usual,' said a capitalist from the
city of Rostov-on-Don in the south of Russia.
Unfortunately, we have too few businessmen and too many politicians. And
politicians can conjure up an infinite number of self-serving alignments
within our disintegrating heartland to defy the richest imagination.
For example, the rebellious President Dudaev of Chechen is calling for an
alliance of oil-producing republics of the Russian federation against Russia
itself. This may sound crazy, but it is no more so than the frighteningly
real armed intervention of the Don cossacks in the conflict between Moldova
and the Dniestre republic.
How does the west fit into this picture? Perhaps the most significant
development in the period following the collapse of the Soviet Union has
been the rapid erosion in the west's ability to influence events in the
republics.
In the Soviet Union the west could have exerted control over events by
balancing its support between President Mikhail Gorbachev and the republics'
leaders. Today, relations between Russia and its territories are analogous
to that which existed between the 'centre' in the former Soviet Union and
the republics.
I hope I am mistaken but I believe that regionalism in the newly independent
republics is unexplored territory for western observers, many of whom are
unfamiliar with both the provinces' leaders and their complex political and
social processes.
Perhaps the best thing that could be done now is for western states to
establish a permanent presence in the key regions.
There are precedents: there were 16 consulates in Rostov-on-Don before the
October revolution. And the consuls successfully combined diplomacy with
business. John Martin, the US consul, for example, owned a mechanical plant,
a mill, a wool factory and a trading house in Rostov-on-Don. Many useful
lessons can be drawn from the past.

The scene is the Theatre Royal, Stratford East. For about 90 minutes Patrick
Prior, in the latest of his plays excoriating the Conservative government
and all its works, has been laying bare the horrors of Trust Hospitals.
Every possibility has become a certainty, every cause for concern turned
into the scandal of the century. Spectres pour forth of patients waiting in
agony for non-existent ambulances; of stroke victims lying unmoved as
hospitals argue about catchment areas; of staff canteens replaced by vending
machines, and staff rationalised out of jobs.
But then Prior loses faith. Perhaps the audience is missing the point. Best
to get an actress to stop the action, mount a soap box, and spell out that
Trust Hospitals mark the start of the privatisation of the health service.
This insult to the intelligence of the audience hardly matters. Stratford
East keeps the Red Flag flying and the paying patrons would be upset if the
cast lost faith. It is like a performance of The Good Old Days: outside
Majors may trumpet and Heseltines blow, but inside we know that left is
right. Perhaps turning the whole thing into a pantomime - with Regina
Freedman, who plays four parts including an ambulance man with a detachable
moustache - shows a lack of confidence. But it adds to the escapist joy of
it all.
And it is quite fun. Mr Wentworth (Jonathan Coote, unnervingly like Ken
Livingstone) is the Pounds 90,000 a year chief executive of a Trust Hospital
who mistakes two lunatics released into the community as the new junior
health minister and her adviser.
The actual health minister is, of course, taken to be a lunatic. This crazy
scenario allows Prior to be equally crazy in his diagnosis of the current
state of the health service.
The argument never rises above the slapstick but the cast know what is
expected and guy away like mad. In the tradition of farce, Wentworth is
reduced to pretending to be an ambulance, with a flashing blue light
strapped to his head, and then gyrating as a limbo dancer to create a
sensual voice as he tries to drum up patients by cold calling them on the
phone.
Alan Cowan, as the lunatic who talks sense, and Yvonne Edgell as his
scatological accomplice, keep the frenzy going. One hopes that no one in
Jeff Teare's production believes that this Play School satire is really
political theatre.
Theatre Royal, Stratford East, until May 9th.

FT  21 APR 92 / Arts: The Alchemist/Macbeth - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The alchemy works. The Royal Shakespeare Company's production of the The
Alchemist, which was made of pretty good metal in the first place, has been
transformed into gold by the move to the big stage at the Barbican. Here it
is now in its full glory, one of the best English comedies of all time.
Sam Mendes's direction at the Swan in Stratford last August was pleasing,
but cramped. It looked micro, whereas The Alchemist is a macro-play.
Consider the range of characters for a start. The villains, Face, Subtle and
Doll Common, succeed not only in duping Sir Epicure Mammon, a knight, but
also Dapper, the sort of clerk who might nowadays be quite high up in the
Bank of England, and Drugger, the tobacconist.
Already we have been through quite a swathe of society. But it does not stop
there. The villains expose the gullibility and double standards of the
puritans of the Dutch church. Up to a point, they deceive Kastril, the angry
boy who arrives in London full of sound and fury and with a rich widowed
sister to be disposed of.
Between times, Face, Subtle and Doll have quarrels of their own. It takes a
deus ex machina in the shape of Lovewit, the master of the house, to come
back and restore order in the most genial way. Lovewit gets the widow and
the left-over booty as well.
If you think that is not enough in the way of variety, look at the crowd
scene towards the end where the neighbours tell stories of all the visits to
the house, then doubt their own word when their accounts are denied by Face.
Shakespeare in the Roman plays sometimes handled the populace with a similar
teasing restraint. The neighbours in The Alchemist are lightly mocked: it is
a tiny scene, but it is a gem in its own right. Not least there is Ben
Jonson's verse. Two of the speeches by Sir Epicure Mammon are up with the
best of Elizabethan and Jacobean drama. When he talks of having his beds
'blown up, not stuffed' and enjoying 'a perpetuity of life and lust', he is
using the language of greater heroes. It is the same sort of ambition as
expressed by Tamburlaine. Jonson shows that it can also be used in a London
town house.
One point may surprise. This is an exceptionally good-natured production.
Perhaps it is a trend of the times: one noticed at the Royal National
Theatre's production of The Recruiting Officer last month how pleasant all
the characters had become and certainly The Alchemist could be more darkly
done. Nobody really gets hurt. The villains could more accurately be
described as rogues. The satire is gently administered, but is no less
satire for that. What you see is the extent to which virtually everyone is
gullible.
Jonathan Hyde and David Bradley are respectively Face and Subtle, the
alchemist. By now they are playing so well together that they could just as
easily reverse roles. The entire production has become even more of a team
performance than it was in the early Stratford days, but there is one part
that must be singled out. That is Guy Henry as Ananias, a deacon of
Amsterdam. Henry's long face, longer hair and total earnestness make you
watch him whenever he appears. Again it is a small part, but another
reminder of how much there is in the play.
* * * The RSC and RNT are not alone, however, in producing stunning versions
of the classics. The English Shakespeare Company has been chosen to open the
International Theatre Festival in Chicago next month and last week showed
its new Macbeth to the national press at the New Theatre, Cardiff. The
production is directed by Michael Bogdanov and Macbeth is played by Michael
Pennington, the ESC's other co-founder.
I was reminded how accurate Shakespeare's titles are. Just as the two parts
of King Henry IV are ultimately a play about Henry IV and not the
surrounding characters, so this production is about Macbeth and not his
wife. Pennington dominates throughout; there is never much suggestion of his
being 'too full of the milk of human kindness'. Occasionally he flinches and
Lady Macbeth (Jenny Quayle) urges him on, but from the start this is a man
who knows what he is doing. At the end he wants to die. It means the
diminishing of Lady Macbeth's role in the play, but as an interpretation one
can hardly quarrel with it.
The ESC has a habit of picking up contemporary events to make its
productions seem more lively. This time it is the huge rocket launcher
commands the stage at the beginning, and the battle with which the play
opens has a touch of modern desert war about it. Later there is the sound of
Malcolm arriving for the final push in a helicopter.
Yet the rocket launcher is variously used. At times it is the steps that
ascend to the throne. Memorably Banquo appears at the very top of it in the
banquet scene. If you think that the ESC takes liberties in these matters,
you have not seen what the Schiller Theatre in Berlin does with the same
play. By contrast, Bogdanov and Pennington are quite conventional. Derek
Smith's Duncan, for instance, is simply an ageing king, who would not think
of commanding Lady Macbeth to his bed as happens in the Schiller version.
The witches are not all that way-out either, though their cauldron is a huge
vessel associated with waste disposal and into which they descend. No great
point is made, but nothing distracts from Pennington's overwhelming Macbeth.
The Alchemist is in repertory at the Barbican (071) 638 8891. Macbeth,
sponsored by IBM, is touring.

An exhibition, Earth, Air, Fire, Water, of the work of the young Japanese
sculptor, Takashito Endo, makes a striking initial impact: a huge and solid
drum of densely charred wood at one end of the gallery, a circle of not so
thoroughly burnt posts at the other, with their tops cupped and filled to
the brim with water, and in the middle, lying on the floor, a large broken
bronze circle like a giant's bracelet.
Such romantic and associative minimalism is hardly novel in itself, nor is
it particularly difficult or obscure in these late modern days, but it is
none the less interesting and imaginatively potent. Its affinity to the work
of our own middle generation of sculptors, such as Richard Long and David
Nash, is clear almost to the point - at a superficial glance - of actual
derivation, but to push that impression too far would be both unfair and
misleading.
The points of similarity between the British and the Japanese lie with a
common feeling for landscape and for the materials of nature and the
landscape. The garden is accepted as a work of art by both cultures and,
even in our mutual decadence, a sense of long historical continuity is still
strong and instinctive. For our part, we still respond to the spirit of
place, vested in such things as megaliths, tombs and monuments, relics of an
ancient and forgotten past. The point of difference is that while still
felt, it is indeed forgotten.
Nash with his low charcoal mound in the forest, like a black barrow, or his
ovens and fires, Long with his stone lines, cairns and circles, might hint
at old meanings, rituals, beliefs, but the old religion that gave them force
is but folk memory and superstition.
Endo, on the other hand, is of a culture that needs no Guy Fawkes excuse for
its autumn beacons. The mythic symbolism that informs his work is still the
stuff of active belief and daily practice, of Zen Buddhism and animistic
Shinto. The fire still purifies and renews what it destroys, the water still
succours and revives.
And always there is the form itself, the object as sculpture, to bring the
work back into the currency of modernism. The physical presence of these
objects is very strong, the smell rich and pungent, the surface irresistibly
tactile, the image simple and monumental.
* * *
Meanwhile the upper galleries of the ICA, which remain two of the most
beautiful exhibition spaces in London, hold a small show of recent works by
the young Scottish artist Callum Innes. He was until lately a figurative
painter, an approach he has abandoned in favour of a rigorous yet seductive
minimalism. The imagery, such as it is, is the direct and natural expression
of the method he has chosen to employ to make it, usually reductive,
sometimes passively sedimentary.
He lays a rich ground of oilpaint across the canvas, which he then erodes or
removes selectively in various ways. A stiff stump of a brush rubs away the
pigment along a single straggling line down the centre of the canvas.
Successive trickles of turpentine run down the surface, washing away the
pigment. As the spirit evaporates and the paint dries, so the surface
wrinkles and contracts to achieve the craquelure of dried mud on a river
bed. An ochre wash, with the pigment in dense suspension, dries and settles
like the sand as the tide goes out.
Again, the influences are manifest, with Innes looking especially to
American minimalists, such as Barnett Newman, Robert Ryman and Morris Louis.
But he remains his own man, going further than Newman's bland and inflated
graphic simplicity. And, close as he is to Ryman in his physical interest in
the surfaces of paint, he rejects his monochrome persistence. He is indeed a
romantic, evidently happy in the associative qualities of his work, for all
its immediate physical preoccupations. He is no narrow theoretician, no
insistent minimalist 'the paint is paint, surface surface man'.
The scale of these things is for the most part merely medium-large, by
modern standards. They are scrupulously made and rather beautiful, and of
course they do raise certain questions. Is it all just a shade too easy?
Just where may the line be drawn between a legitimate painterly enquiry and
development and an indulgent, exquisite aestheticism? What is the point?
There can be no answers to such questions, save only what subsequent work
affords. Should indeed the work come to confine itself merely to predictable
and elegant variation, then those doubts would naturally confirm themselves
as positive accusations. But Innes is young enough, and his work properly
varied and rich enough to secure, for the moment at least, the benefit of
those doubts. He must only let the work lead him where it will, rather than
content himself with effects he has already mastered. The pictorial
imagination, its spaces conjured by a single wobbly line crossing and
dividing a ground, should see him through.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Glasgow is cock of the walk in European conservation, winning five of the
annual Europa Nostra awards for conservation and new construction in
conservation areas.
This year the scheme attracted more than 125 entries from 20 countries. It
is sponsored by American Express, and the now merged Europa
Nostra/International Castles Institute runs it. Seven projects won medals of
honour, and 36 won diplomas of merit.
The two British medallists are the Foreign and Commonwealth Office,
refurbished to its Victorian splendour, and the 18th century court house and
jail in Inveraray, Argyllshire.
Other winners are from Germany (the Hotel im Wasserturm in Cologne, and
three ancient revolving windmills at Oberoderwitz), Norway (Arendal town),
and Spain (the San Isidro chapel in the San Andres church in Madrid, and a
15th century house in Valencia).
Diploma winners include a fortified church in Romania, Dublin Castle,
Trinity College Cambridge, dock conversions in Amsterdam, the Ca'd'oro
Building in Glasgow (along with four other schemes there) and the National
Trust's restoration of the exotic Victorian garden at Biddulph Grange in
Staffordshire.

FT  21 APR 92 / Management: Bending the ear of your MP - Charles Batchelor
offers advice on how businesses can best make their voices heard in
Westminster
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The response of the hotel and restaurant owners of Presteigne, Powys to the
recent raft of food hygiene laws was to call on the services of their local
Liberal Democrat MP.
Two meetings were arranged for them to explain their difficulties to the MP,
Richard Livsey, who then held a third meeting to put their views to the
local environmental health officer.
Beryl Darsley, licencee of The Farmers' Inn and organiser of the campaign,
says that the pressure the caterers brought through their MP led to a more
consistent approach by the environmental health officials.
Unfortunately for Darsley and her supporters, Livsey lost his seat earlier
this month. If the campaign is to continue, they will have to brief their
new MP.
The election may have caught Darsley and her group in mid-campaign but for
business generally the changes wrought by the election and the influx of
more than 120 new MPs present an ideal opportunity for businesses to strike
up a relationship with their new representative in Westminster.
Despite the belief that lobbying is the preserve of the larger company with
its own full-time public affairs department, the smaller business can
achieve results - if it goes about it the right way.
'Our members sometimes think they will achieve more if we write on their
behalf, but nothing carries more weight with an MP than a letter from a
company in his constituency,' says Stephen Alambritis, parliamentary officer
of the Federation of Small Businesses.
Business owners often forget that they have something to offer their MP,
says John Warburton, head of the parliamentary office of the Confederation
of British Industry (CBI). 'Businesses provide MPs with information, so they
can come to more balanced judgements, and give them an opportunity to raise
their profile.'
Many of the professionals say that the best method is for the business to
establish contact with its MP before it has a problem so that if an issue
arises he or she will already be familiar with the company. Inviting the MP
to visit a factory or getting him to present certificates to apprentices may
give him a welcome chance to get his picture in the local paper.
If an issue does come up which requires the MP's help he should be contacted
either by phone or letter through his constituency office or his office in
Westminster. (Dod's Parliamentary Companion lists MPs' Westminster office
numbers and addresses. The House of Commons switchboard number is 071 219
3000. Its public information office number is 071 219 4272).
Small business owners frequently become emotionally involved in issues and
do not always put their arguments clearly. 'Often they don't prepare a
constructive case,' says Nicholas Winterton, Conservative MP for
Macclesfield. 'They unload huge amounts of paperwork on their MPs. They
should set out their case on two sides of paper; the facts should be
accurate and they should not exaggerate.'
Provided the business makes a sound case to its MP, his response is likely
to be a letter to the minister involved. The minister will reply to the MP
who will pass the response on to his constituent. If this does not produce a
satisfactory reply the MP may then press for a meeting between the
constituent, the minister and the civil servants.
When Ian Guthrie, owner of Rombalds hotel and restaurant in Ilkley, West
Yorkshire, protested about being fined Pounds 2,000 by Customs &amp; Excise for
filing his VAT returns three days late, Max Madden Labour MP for Bradford
West put detailed questions on VAT penalties to the Chancellor the
Exchequer.
Businesses should always start their lobbying with their constituency MP,
says Alambritis. But many MPs espouse particular causes (MP's interests are
listed in Dod's) and will take up a campaign for non-constituents.
Guthrie wrote to his own MP, as well as to local business organisations and
the Yorkshire Post newspaper. This prompted Madden, MP for a neighbouring
constituency, to take up his case.
Professional lobbyists suggest an informal league table of factors which
will influence the enthusiasm of MPs for their constituents' causes. MPs
from the ruling party keen on making a ministerial career are less likely to
rock the boat than long-standing back-benchers from the opposition. This
tends to rule out effective action from parliamentary private secretaries
and whips.
MPs with small majorities may also prove more active than those in very safe
seats. One businessman who supplies car phones feels his Conservative MP did
not take up his complaint about the 1991 tax on portable phones partly
because of his 20,000-plus majority.
The determined small business owner can make some progress by using his MP,
but may improve his chances of achieving results by broadening his campaign.
The more general the issues the more likely he will gain the backing of his
trade association or business lobby group. 'We will only take up the broader
issues,' says the CBI's Warburton.
The London Chamber of Commerce has a seven-strong policy studies department
which spends much of its time on 'representation' work. 'We find it
difficult to take up local issues but we do pick up regional and national
matters,' says Jacqueline Ginnane, who heads the department.
Businesses sometimes turn to professional lobbying consultancies though
their fees are too high for some small firms. 'We tend to work for large
companies or trade associations,' says David Robertson, joint managing
director of Political Relations.
Robertson believes it is more cost-effective for a small business to lobby
through its trade association. Paying a professional lobbyist to monitor
forthcoming legislation can cost between Pounds 500 and Pounds 600 a month;
providing a briefing service to MPs and civil servants, Pounds 7,000 to
Pounds 8,000 a year; and a full-blown campaign from Pounds 20,000 upwards.
How effective is lobbying? Small firms must be realistic in their
expectations, the experts stress. They may ensure that the rules are
interpreted in a favourable fashion but only rarely can they force a change
in the rules themselves.
The London Chamber of Commerce believes its lobbying contributed to an
easing in the last Budget of the terms of the Uniform Business Rate though
the government did not grant all of its demands. However David Robertson
points to a successful campaign by the contract cleaning industry to open up
local authority cleaning contracts to commercial bidders.
'There are occasions when you can help because departments do make
mistakes,' says Henry McLeish, Labour MP for Fife Central. 'More often it is
a question not of getting the answer my constituents want but of getting an
answer more quickly.' McLeish may be being too modest. Government
departments do not like to admit they have got something wrong even when an
effective lobby convinces them they have.

FT  21 APR 92 / BR faulted over safety projects
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FAR FEWER railway passengers' lives would be lost if British Rail worried
less about preventing headline-hitting train disasters and concentrated on
stopping people falling out of trains, according to an analysis in May's
edition of Railway Gazette International.
Mr Richard Hope, the magazine's consultant editor, says statistical evidence
suggests that British Rail's safety spending bears little relation to the
potential for saving life.
In the three years from 1988 to 1990, nearly half the 615 passengers killed
or seriously injured were victims of accidents while getting on or off
trains or falling out of them.
Most such deaths and injuries could be avoided by replacing old 'slam-door'
carriages with new trains fitted with power-operated doors. Instead,
however, BR has slowed the replacement of old trains to pump more money into
measures aimed at preventing big train crashes.
The most costly of those measures is automatic train protection, an
electronic system of controlling trains that is intended to reduce or
eliminate the possibility of high-speed collisions.
An analysis of the accident records of 10 European countries from 1981 to
1990 shows that those with automatic train protection did have lower
casualty rates, but the differences were small.
Mr Hope says the analysis suggests that France, which has suffered a spate
of train disasters since 1986, might have recorded 126 fewer deaths and 82
fewer serious injuries between 1981 and 1990 if it had installed automatic
train protection.
France is now spending FFr4.6bn (Pounds 465m) on installing automatic train
protection. Mr Hope questions whether such investment can be justified by
the potential savings in casualties when Department of Transport
computations put the cost of a death at Pounds 665,000 and a serious injury
at Pounds 20,000.
Mr Hope concludes that such investment probably cannot be justified. The
main fault of the railways is in apparently not attempting an investment
appraisal of this nature - or at least not making it public.

FT  21 APR 92 / DTI backs Sellafield search for job-creation schemes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SEARCH for job-creating innovations will start at the Sellafield
nuclear-waste reprocessing site in Cumbria next week. The Department of
Trade and Industry is spending Pounds 38,000 on a study in which consultants
from Price Waterhouse will try to discover which of Sellafield's many
technological innovations of the past four decades can be marketed to create
new jobs in the coastal strip that stretches for 50 miles from Maryport to
Barrow-in-Furness.
About 5,000 construction jobs are being shed at Sellafield now that building
work is ending at British Nuclear Fuels' Pounds 1.85bn Thermal Oxide
Reprocessing Plant (Thorp), Europe's biggest single investment project of
the 1980s. Thousands of jobs are to go at the VSEL submarine yards in
Barrow-in-Furness thanks to the 'peace dividend'.
Many hopes in west Cumbria are pinned on the Price Waterhouse research, the
first technology-transfer project in Britain backed by the DTI specifically
to aid business creation. The purpose of the study is to select a product
and assemble a business package in order to tempt a manufacturer to take it
up. The one condition is that the product must be made in west Cumbria.
The project, likely to take at least a year to the manufacturing stage, is
not seen as a rapid route to jobs. Sharp contraction in steelmaking, loss of
coal mining, low levels of formation of small businesses and failure to
attract much new inward investment were overshadowed in the 1980s by the
jobs boom at Sellafield and VSEL. But unemployment has risen by up to 50 per
cent in the past year in some parts of west Cumbria and jobless rates of up
25 per cent are expected. British Coal's decision to phase out opencast
mining in Cumbria and Albright &amp; Wilson's ending of phosphate rock
processing at Whitehaven will cost 500 direct jobs and have serious knock-on
effects for the ports of Workington and Whitehaven and British Rail's line
along the coast.
Volvo's impending closure of its Workington bus plant, where 370 people
work, has damaged morale and jobs. News that Dawnfresh, a fish processor
that employs 140 people in Whitehaven, is moving to central Scotland has
heightened concern over Copeland and Barrow's lack of assisted-area status.
West Cumbria's poor communications exacerbate the difficulties. The area has
no motorways and air links, and even its main coastal road is not a dual
carriageway.
The local private and public sectors are acknowledging the need for
self-help. 'It's pointless our sitting in our splendid isolation throwing
stones at everybody - we have to help ourselves,' said Mr Tim Knowles, who
is chairman in Cumbria of the Confederation of British Industry, head of UK
corporate affairs at BNFL and general manager of the mainly BNFL-funded West
Cumbria Development Fund.
Belated recognition of the structural troubles has spurred various
diversification initiatives in the past few years, many of them heavily
funded by BNFL.
West Cumbria's flagship scheme is the Westlakes Science and Technology Park
near Sellafield, a WCDF/Rural Development Commission partnership. The first
business has just moved in and BNFL is contributing Pounds 2.5m for an
Environmental Research Institute on the site.
The county's public and private sectors are completing arrangements for a
campaign for this summer to raise Cumbria's national profile. 'I don't know
whether that many people realise the Lake District is in a place called
Cumbria,' Mr Knowles said. 'It's the best place in the world to live.'

KIRKLEES and Wakefield chamber of commerce and industry, which covers West
Yorkshire south of the M62, says many local indicators of economic
performance are now at their best for 24 months.
The chamber says sales and orders started rising again in the first quarter
of the year. The indications, it says, suggest a sluggish recovery. Levels
of trade are only back where they were when recession began to affect the

NEARLY 80 per cent of companies in the East Midlands, one of the most

first quarter of this year, according to the latest business survey of the
region's chambers of commerce.
The results of the survey, carried out in March and covering 336 companies,
provide scant evidence of any recovery from recession. The number of
companies with under-used capacity has remained fairly constant since 1990.

FT  21 APR 92 / Outlook bleak for forging industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE OUTPUT of the British forging industry fell by nearly a quarter last
year and the prospects for the current year look little better, the British
Forging Industry Association says in its report for last year, Paul
Cheeseright writes.
It said: 'The best that can be hoped for is no further deterioration in
demand, and perhaps the beginning of a slow recovery in the second half of
the year,' it said.
The industry which describes itself 'as a good a barometer as any of the
health - or sickness - of UK manufacturing industry,' faced reduced demand
last year from all its customers except those in the railways and industrial
engine sectors.
More than half of the steel forgings produced go to the vehicle industry.
Total production of steel forgings in 1991 was 175,255 tonnes, of which just
over 20 per cent was exported. Exports exceeded imports by an estimated
5,115 tonnes.

FT  21 APR 92 / Call for clarity on asset values
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN ACCOUNTING practice allowing companies not to show as losses falls in the
value of unsold assets should be outlawed, the Accounting Standards Board
has argued in a preliminary statement.
Any transfers of assets from current to fixed assets should be made at the
lower of cost or net realisable value of the asset at the date of transfer.
Post-retirement benefits apart from pensions should in principle be
recognised as liabilities, it said in a second initial ruling on contentious
practices being considered by its Urgent Issues Task Force.
Both interim recommendations are still open to discussion, but they have
been released as part of a process of glasnost initiated by the task force
after criticism of its operations by companies.
The task force hopes to reach a consensus on the subject at its next meeting
on May 1 this year, after which its opinion will be binding in UK company
accounting policy.
It says in the second ruling that all post-retirement benefits - such as
health care - should be treated using SSAP 24, the existing accounting
guideline on pensions. It is still considering the details of disclosure
requirements, and at what stage the liabilities of benefits should be
included in consolidated accounts.
Recommendations on the role of auditors and the future direction of their
profession will be published this autumn, the Auditing Practices Board has
said.
A working group chaired by Mr John McFarlane, head of Citibank in the UK and
Ireland, has been set up to examine how far auditors meet the needs and
expectations of users of financial information.

FT  21 APR 92 / Publicans feel the draught: Philip Rawstorne finds that
while bar prices are rising, many pubs face the threat of closure in a
restructured environment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP RAWSTORNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR GERALD Richardson, whose company runs nine pubs in London, likens himself
to the proverbial duck. 'We've had to paddle like hell in this recession -
but at least we've managed to keep our head above water,' he says.
'Since last April, we've worked harder on promotions than ever before but
trade on average has fallen about 12 per cent. It's not been disastrous, but
it's certainly been tough.'
Mr Bruce Allen, whose Allen Partnership owns nearly 100 pubs throughout the
country, says: 'Our beer volumes are down 8 per cent overall, and we've also
reduced our profit margins.'
The effect of the recession has varied from region to region. Scotland and
northern England have generally fared better than the Midlands and the
south.
Business at the Five Pilchards in the Cornish village of Porthallow has
fallen 15 per cent. The Three Moles in Selham, West Sussex, reports that
trade has been flat. In the traditional Tap and Spile in Hexham,
Northumberland, cask ale sales have risen profitably.
But the snug bar has certainly shivered as never before in the economic
draught. Many publicans have caught a cold.
Of the 700 non-tied pubs on the market in January, about 50 were 'distress
sales' by receivers, double the number in January 1991. Almost as many again
were put up for auction by owners cutting their losses.
Mr Barrie Lomas, of Inn Data, the pub trade researcher, says many of the
pubs were bought three or four years ago at the top of the market. Profits
no longer covered repayment of high-interest loans.
The proportion of casualties is still relatively small but the numbers
continue to rise. The cost of what many publicans describe as the worst
trading conditions for 40 years has started to appear in the bad-debt
provisions made by brewers against their loans to free-trade pubs.
Whitbread last week raised its provisions to Pounds 37m, indicating that
about a quarter of the 11,000 pubs and bars it supplies in the free trade
were in financial difficulties.
Bass has increased its bad-debt provisions to Pounds 16m and written off
Pounds 2.6m. Marston has provided for more than Pounds 4m.
Although pre-tax profits of those three companies have slipped, most brewers
have so far been able to maintain or improve profits, and all have raised
dividends.
Customers may have ordered fewer beers last year but they paid more for
them. Volume sales fell 7 per cent. Prices, excluding tax, rose by about 11
per cent.
The price rises helped to compensate national brewers for a loss of volume
that was exacerbated by the enforced sale of pubs to meet the requirements
of the government's beer orders.
Those lay down that by November this year all the national brewers have to
free large numbers of pubs - about 11,000 in all - from 'tied' exclusive
beer supplies.
Bass has so far sold 2,200 pubs. Whitbread has sold almost 1,000 and
Allied-Lyons and IEL, the Courage/GrandMet pub company, nearly 2,000 between
them.
The restructuring, they claim, is costing them Pounds 500m - equivalent to
5p a pint on annual beer sales. Regional brewers have seized the opportunity
to strengthen their pub estates. Vaux has just added 113 pubs to its
existing estate of 900.
Morland bought 100 pubs for Pounds 16.4m from Courage to expand its Thames
Valley estate by a third. Mansfield has acquired 115 Courage pubs to build
its east Midlands trade and Marston consolidated its Midlands base by paying
Pounds 7.6m for 49 Allied pubs.
Brent Walker has leased 734 pubs from Allied, and Devenish has rented 115
from Whitbread.
Hundreds of the pubs have been bought by sitting tenants. New pub companies
have been formed. Century Inns, run by a former brewery manager, has
acquired 270 pubs in north-east England within a few months, for example.
There is no lack of faith, it seems, in the future of the pub trade,
whatever its present difficulties.
There is a down side, though. Many of the pubs on offer are unlikely to be
viable as single units detached from the large brewers' estates.
Mr Simon Redman, chairman of Greene King, the East Anglian brewer, says:
'There are many rural pubs on the market which should close because they are
never going to make money.' Industry observers estimate that before the end
of the decade 10,000 pubs will have closed.
The survivors will face fresh challenges and a greater demand on their
business skills during the 1990s.
The demographic trend is unfavourable. There will be fewer young men
regularly drinking pints of 'session' lagers.
Older customers will be more discerning, value-for-money spenders, demanding
a wide choice of branded drinks, good food and more comfortable
surroundings.
Increased competition will squeeze profit margins. The take-home trade,
increasingly in the hands of the multiple grocers, is expected to grow from
about 22 per cent to 40 per cent of the beer market.
Some consumer resistance to the increases in pub prices was evident last
year. With volume sales likely to fall again this year by about 4 per cent,
there will be little scope to make up the shortfall through price rises.
Pubs are going to find life in a cold climate much less comfortable than it
has been in the past.

FT  21 APR 92 / Retailers report rise in Easter spending
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE and JULIET SYCHRAVA
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RETAILERS yesterday reported a growing sense of confidence as takings in
many stores rose sharply.
The City is still expecting retail sales for March - the figures are
published on Friday - to be unchanged from February and to be down on March
a year ago, but in the shops the Easter weekend has helped to remove the
uncertainty created in the approach to the general election.
In Oxford Street, London, Mr Tony Butler, general manager of DH Evans,
reported brisk activity over the whole of the holiday weekend with 'an
exceptionally good' Monday. He estimated that takings would be as much as 50
per cent higher than a year ago.
At the MetroCentre in Gateshead, north-east England, Mr David Thomson,
Littlewoods store manager and chairman of the shopping centre's tenants
association, said: 'We are very pleased with the level of business. There
does seem to have been a release of consumer spending.
'This is the first seasonal peak of the year, and it is nice to have it in a
climate that is becoming more spending oriented. If Easter had fallen before
the election, we would not have had a particularly successful period.'
Mr Thomson said takings were about 9 per cent higher than Easter a year ago,
when spending was boosted artificially by the imminent rise in value added
tax.
Even at the Brent Cross shopping centre in north-west London, where trading
has been affected by the nearby IRA bombing 11 days ago, retailers reported
better-than-expected levels of business.
At the Lakeside Shopping Centre, Thurrock, Mr Richard Lusty, House of Fraser
store manager, said: 'Good Friday was a bumper day. The car parks were full.
Customers were definitely spending. We certainly had the feeling that the
end of the recession had started.
'On Friday there was definitely a buzz. There is not spending in a silly
mood, but there is a sign of confidence coming back to the stores.'
Alton Towers, the Staffordshire theme park in which Pearson, owner of the
Financial Times has a stake, had about 20 per cent more visitors than last
year.
Mr Nick Varney, Alton Towers divisional marketing director, said: 'It's the
most successful Easter ever.'
Ms Bronwyn Gold Blyth of Lunn Poly, the UK's biggest travel agent chain,
reported 'good business' on Saturday.
The interest in Pounds 400-Pounds 450 package holidays to the Mediterranean
has held up well in recent weeks, in spite of the recession and election
uncertainty. Since the election, though, more people are again looking to
more expensive locations such as the Caribbean Australasia and the Far East.

FT  21 APR 92 / Small shift in voting could change control in Edinburgh
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DISTRICT council elections in Scotland will take place in a political
landscape transformed by the general election. For the first time since the
early 1980s, the Scottish Conservatives are going into elections in high
spirits and the other parties with apprehension.
The big prize is Edinburgh, where a vigorous campaign against Labour was
launched last week. Although the Tories hold 22 wards to Labour's 32, a
relatively small number of votes need to move from Labour to Conservative to
ensure a Tory victory.
Unless pressure for a referendum on devolution gathers, the district council
elections seem likely to be fought on the usual local-government issues,
which in 1988 produced a turnout of about 45 per cent. Of the 53 Scottish
district councils, Labour starts with outright control of 27, the Tories and
Liberal Democrats three each and the Scottish National party one. The rest
are controlled either by independents or by coalitions of the non-Tory
parties. The Scottish Conservatives will continue to hold Berwickshire,
where seven of their 12 councillors are unopposed, and should keep Eastwood,
and Bearsden &amp; Milngavie, near Glasgow. They expect to win Stirling, where
Mr Michael Forsyth was returned as MP on April 9 and where control in the
council went to Labour last time on the spin of a coin.
They also hope to end rule by an SNP/Liberal Democrat coalition in Perth &amp;
Kinross, where Sir Nicholas Fairbairn held his parliamentary seat.
Although the Conservatives did better in north-east Scotland in the general
election they would be doing very well to win Gordon (where they currently
have no councillors at all) from the Liberal Democrats, and to take
Kincardine &amp; Deeside where they have only two from independents. Labour,
demoralised after the general election, will be fighting off a challenge
from the SNP, which is fielding more candidates than any other party. Labour
hopes to fight off the nationalists in Cumbernauld and Kilsyth, where it won
control only on the spin of a coin in 1988. It expects to hold Edinburgh.
Although the SNP will hope to do well across Scotland by fighting the local
elections on the referendum promise, it already has good chances of adding
to Angus, the one council it holds, if its vote goes up as it did the
general election. They could win Banff &amp; Buchan in the north-east, and in
the central belt take Clackmannan, West Lothian and Motherwell.
The Liberal Democrats should hold their councils in Gordon, north-east Fife
and Annandale and Eskdale in the south-west.

FT  21 APR 92 / Labour faces a snub from workers: David Goodhart in Perth
finds the unions reviewing links with their traditional party
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PERTH
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE LEADERS of some of Britain's biggest unions, gathered yesterday in Perth
for the annual meeting of the Scottish Trades Union Congress, seemed agreed
on one thing: Labour's election defeat will mean a significant loosening of
links between the unions and the party.
How far, financially and politically, the disentanglement will go is still
not clear, but Mr Bill Morris, general secretary of the TGWU general union,
is talking about shifting resources from the Labour party at national level
to European lobbying, industrial campaigns and local government.
Mr John Edmonds, general secretary of the GMB general union, wants a swift
cut in the union block vote at the Labour party conference from 90 per cent
to 50 per cent, a shift in union influence in the party from national to
local, and a complete withdrawal of the unions from the electoral college
for electing the leader, where they now hold 40 per cent of the votes.
Why, then, has Mr Edmonds been popping up on our TV screens over the past
week, like a union baron from the 1970s, hinting that his union, like the
other big unions, will be delivering the vote for Mr John Smith as leader?
Mr Edmonds says that as long as unions have 40 per cent of the electoral
college they cannot deny their political role. At least his union is holding
a workplace ballot on how the union should vote. The AEU engineering union
has come out firmly against a ballot and the TGWU is dithering. Thanks to
the GMB example and a bit of prodding from the Labour leadership campaign,
some momentum is now building up behind balloting in all unions.
The whole incident has been an embarrassing reminder that the Labour party
remains far from the European-style social democratic party to which most of
its leaders aspire.
In the medium term, the prospects for moving closer to that model, at least
regarding the union-party link, must be good. Mr John Smith, the probable
next leader, has hinted he wants reform and many leading union figures
agree.
Mr Edmonds, a forward thinker, believes that while Labour remains
financially dependent on the unions, they cannot de-affiliate. He adds that
unions still provide necessary 'ballast' against the constituency parties.
He does, however, want union withdrawal from the electoral college and a big
cut in the block vote plus a re-organisation in the way it functions to
prevent small delegations or single leaders from wielding millions of votes.
He also wants a permanent shift in the union role from the national level,
where unions inflict political damage on Labour, to the local level, where
unions could - in view of the failure to create a mass party - be
politically beneficial by getting activists to join the party as individual
members.
However, in the short term the Labour party will get the worst of all worlds
from the unions. It will suffer politically from the insensitively obtrusive
role of the unions in the leadership contest.
It will suffer financially because the unions' first step, after the
election defeat, will be to cut affiliation payments. In the run-up to the
election, many unions were affiliating more members than was justified by
their declining rolls. Affiliation fees will now be realigned with reality,
which may mean a drop of about 10 per cent.
In the past, Labour might have asked for a corresponding increase in the
affiliation fee or for one-off top-ups from the big loyalist unions, the
TGWU and the GMB. Both Mr Edmonds and Mr Morris made clear yesterday that
both requests would now be rejected.
While the unions do not rule out funding future Labour election campaigns -
they paid 90 per cent of the last one - the non-union element of Labour
running costs will have to increase from the present figure of 50 per cent.
Where will the unions' resources be diverted? Mr Morris offers the idea of
sponsoring local councillors and also suggests that several unions might
combine to staff a professional lobbying body in Brussels.
The unions will, above all, need all the revenues they can keep for their
mundane industrial work. Falling membership may be exacerbated by the
government's intention to press on with plans to change the rules on
'automatic check-off'.
Mr Morris talks about a 'sharper industrial focus' and mentions broadening
the collective bargaining agenda to include training and
corporate-investment strategies.
There is some hope that the new government may be open to dialogue in
consensual areas such as health and safety, equality and training. Yesterday
the TGWU and GMB, which many believe could formally merge within three
years, appealed to the government to support their campaign for a minimum of
five days' training for all workers each year.
The unions will present this demand in all major bargaining units. Mr
Edmonds said: 'This is an opportunity for the government and the employers
to follow up their fine words on training with some action.'

FT  21 APR 92 / Flexibility on pensions is resisted
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS and NORMA COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT is resisting pressure from the pensions industry for a
flexible 'decade of retirement' as the method for equalising male and female
state retirement ages.
Ministers seem likely to announce this year that the age at which women
become eligible for a state pension will rise from 60 to either 63 or 65
some time after the year 2000.
The appointment last week of Mr Peter Lilley, a rightwinger and former
Treasury minister, as social security secretary aroused speculation that he
might bow to Treasury pressure. Other European Community countries are
moving towards higher retirement ages.
The Department of Social Security, which published a paper on equalising
retirement ages last December, has made clear that lowering men's retirement
age to 60 is unlikely as it would cost an estimated Pounds 3.5bn a year. A
common retirement age of 63 would save the government about Pounds 500m a
year, although the Treasury may seek a mutual retirement age of 65, expected
to save at least Pounds 3bn a year.
The move to equalise pension ages follows a ruling from the European Court
in 1990 that the present system of allowing women to retire at 60 with a
full pension while requiring men to work until 65 is discriminatory. Last
December the DSS put forward proposals to equalise state retirement
benefits. The proposals clearly favoured equalisation at 63.
The proposals were roundly criticised by the pensions industry because much
of British industry has been moving to adopt flexible retirement schemes. In
1989 a House of Lords committee urged a 'decade of retirement' which would
give more choice to pensioners and to employers. Employers prefer
flexibility because it enables them to keep experienced workers on the
payroll.
In a flexible scheme, those who retire at 60 earn pensions based on a lower
salary, while those who work longer can earn more. Pensions experts have
said a national retirement age at 63, or even 65, would make flexibility in
private schemes impossible.
Ministers are said to believe privately that a flexible scheme would
discriminate against blue-collar workers, who often have no occupational
scheme to supplement state benefits and who thus have to work longer.
Meanwhile, white-collar workers could retire comfortably at 60.
Also, ministers are said to have been concerned at the difficulties in
funding a flexible retirement scheme. Because UK pensions are paid out of
the National Insurance contributions of current workers, any increase in
pensions means higher taxes for employees. Because of the difficulty in
predicting how many people would retire in any one year, taxes would have to
be raised to assume a worst-case scenario in which all eligible 60-year-olds
chose to retire.

FT  21 APR 92 / Conservatives aim for a further victory: Andrew Adonis
assesses the main parties in the run-up to the local-government elections
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Conservatives will hope to repeat their general election success in the
local elections to be held across England and Wales on May 7.
Local elections are vehicles for mid-term protest and with the Tories about
to enter their fourteenth consecutive year in office, the opposition parties
are entrenched in town halls across the country. Only one of England's 36
metropolitan districts remains Tory.
Labour has 69 per cent of all metropolitan district councillors, with the
Tories reduced to 18 per cent. The Liberal Democrats have 10 per cent.
Even in the English shires the Tories can claim to be only the largest
minority party - with 38 per cent of non-metropolitan district council
seats, against 30 per cent held by Labour and 19 per cent by the Liberal
Democrats.
In Wales the respective division is 8 per cent, 45 per cent, and 5 per cent,
with Plaid Cymru holding 8 per cent of the seats.
A host of safe Conservative parliamentary seats now embraces Labour or
Liberal councils. It is not just metropolitan areas such as Bury, Greater
Manchester, and Wirral, Merseyside. Labour commands an overall majority on
the following 16 councils, yet failed on April 9 to take any of the 21
parliamentary seats they embrace: Basildon, Blackpool, Brighton, Erewash,
Great Yarmouth, Langbaurgh, Lincoln, Luton, Milton Keynes, Reading, Slough,
Watford, Waveney, Welwyn Hatfield, Worcester and Wyre Forest.
The Liberal Democrats similarly failed to replicate local success in
Congleton, Eastbourne, Hereford, Lewes, Poole, Taunton, Torbay and North
Wiltshire.
'Our troops are over the moon about the general election: they expect to
make solid advances in the locals,' said Mr David Trowbridge, the Tories'
local-elections officer. Bury, Woking, Wolverhampton and Winchester are Tory
targets.
Tory gains are likely to be modest, however, since the seats up for election
in May were last contested in 1988, a good year for the Conservatives. In
1988 the Tories were ahead in the national polls and made a net gain of six
council seats. Labour gained 104 net, while the Liberal Democrats suffered a
net loss of 75.
Some gains by the Liberal Democrats at the Tories' expense are likely, given
the centre party's post-1988 revival. They hope to make the small advances
needed to take overall control in three councils: Brentwood and Colchester
in Essex, and Harrogate. Liberal Democrats might also remove Tory overall
majorities in North Herts, Basingstoke and Bath.
Labour hopes to keep intact its existing base and translate general election
advances into further gains. Derby, Exeter, Gloucester, Peterborough and
Portsmouth saw strong Labour performances on April 9, and the Tories are
defending a strong 1988 showing in each.
Even so, the council elections will be a low-key affair - and not just
because of voter apathy and activist exhaustion.
It is the 'light' year of the local electoral cycle: there are no elections
in London, and only four of the 37 district councils in Wales and 114 of the
296 non-metropolitan districts in England are holding polls. All England's
metropolitan districts are up for election. With only a third of the seats
up for grabs in all the authorities polling, though, the scope for violent
swings is small.

FT  21 APR 92 / Campaign on disease is backed by TUC
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A CAMPAIGN has been launched to alert people with runny noses that they may
be suffering from an industrial disease for which they can claim
compensation from the Department of Social Security.
Inflammation or ulceration of the mucous membrane, provoked by exposure to
dust, liquid or vapours in the workplace, has been covered by government
compensation schemes since the 1920s. But claims have been rare because
sufferers often blame colds, hay fever or allergies.
Now the condition - D4 in official terminology - looks likely to receive
greater recognition because of a campaign led by the four Trades Union
Congress Unemployed Centres in Tyne and Wear. The campaign is expected to be
extended nationally.
The move follows the Sunderland centre's recent success in helping a former
shipyard welder to claim government compensation for mucous membrane
disease. Mr Thomas Brown, who developed nasal trouble after working in tanks
sprayed with polyurethane, was judged 15 per cent disabled and awarded a
weekly pension of Pounds 17.68, plus Pounds 4,600 for backdating to 1982.
The campaign immediately encouraged dozens of inquiries.
The DSS does not keep breakdowns of payments for prescribed diseases and
industrial accidents. It paid out a total of about Pounds 600m in 1991-92 in
compensatory benefits, up from Pounds 520m in 1990-91. Sufferers from D4,
which can cause nasal bleeding, hoarseness and a dry throat, may be eligible
for sick pay, invalidity, sickness or disablement benefit or reduced
earnings allowance.

FT  21 APR 92 / Legal aid move faces opposition
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LAW Society has called on the government to withdraw a legal-aid
circular sent to magistrates' courts which it claims is unlawful and could
deprive defendants of legal representation, Robert Rice writes.
The circular, issued by the Lord Chancellor's Department, tells courts not
to grant legal aid unless applicants can produce documentary evidence to
support their statement of means.
The society says it will be impossible for defendants arrested and kept in
custody overnight to have access to such documentation by the time they
appear in court.
Either many defendants will be refused legal aid and will not be represented
at the start of their cases, or the cases will be held up as defendants
obtain the documentation.
Mr Andrew Lockley, the society's director of legal practice, said: 'The Lord
Chancellor's Department issued this circular without consulting the
profession. If followed it will cause serious delay to court proceedings and
potentially serious hardship to defendants, particularly those remanded in
custody. The department should withdraw it immediately.'

FT  21 APR 92 / Costs fail to deter Channel 5 bids
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AT LEAST three serious contenders are expected to bid for the Channel 5
franchise. They are Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the Italian television
entrepreneur; Mr Justin Dukes, the former managing director of Channel 4,
and Mr Moses Znaimer, founder of City TV in Toronto, who is part of the Five
TV consortium.
The three are expected to go ahead with their bids in spite of the high
initial cost of getting on air the new television channel, which will be
able to reach three quarters of the UK's population.
The contenders who have identified themselves so far say they believe they
can cope with the terms of the licence, which were spelled out by the
Independent Television Commission last Tuesday.
Mr Berlusconi's Fininvest says it is going ahead with drawing up
comprehensive plans. Five TV, which has been working for more than a year on
the project, says it is delighted at the terms of the licence and the way
the commission modified the rules to give the project a better chance of
success. The commission has dropped its original intention of setting an
extra charge of 5 per cent of the operator's net advertising revenue to go
to the government. It has instead set a zero rate.
Mr Dukes is pressing ahead with plans to bid with his Channel S project, to
be based in Edinburgh. He is being advised by Rothschilds, the merchant
bank.
Other possible contenders include Mr Phil Redmond's Mersey Television and a
Northern Independent Producers consortium.
There are unlikely to be many credible bidders because of the scale of the
costs compared with the likely size of the market. Another factor is that
under the 1990 Broadcasting Act the channel will have to take on many of the
programme obligations of ITV. The chosen operator must offer news, current
affairs, and children's and religious programming. Overall Channel 5 must
offer a service that is diverse and appeals to a wide range of tastes.
Mr Dukes plans initially to offer a service of largely bought-in programmes.
That is all the channel will be able to afford, he believes, because of the
high initial costs.
The winner of the licence not only has to pay for the transmitter system but
also for the retuning of about 3m video recorders which will suffer
interference from the Channel 5 transmission. Few think it will be possible
to get Channel 5 on air for less than Pounds 100m.
Mr Berlusconi, in partnership with Mr Mike Bolland, managing director of
Channel X, is planning a more expensive schedule with a strong emphasis on
film and TV drama produced in the UK. It will be combined with what Mr
Bolland calls 'a mix of hard news and personality-based current affairs'.
Five TV is planning a city-based channel which will launch with a service
for London and use the funds from that to move on to other big UK cities.
The concept is heavily influenced by Mr Znaimer, whose City TV in Toronto
concentrates on local news, films and popular music.
None of the leading contenders has all, or even most of its investors signed
up. Possible investors, who include Time Warner, the world's largest media
company, Mr Conrad Black's Daily Telegraph and two ITV companies that lost
their franchises, Thames Television and TV-am, have been talking to
potential bidders.
At the moment Five TV seems to have one advantage. It has already carried
out extensive technical work on the retuning of videos, including
transmission of test signals to see how extensive interference will be. Five
TV has also carried out detailed research on the cost of the retuning and
how long it will take.
The commission, fearful of being blamed for interfering with television
reception for millions of viewers, has made clear that unless a bidder has
demonstrated that it can solve and pay for the video problem it will not get
over the initial quality threshold. If no one can offer a solution, the
franchise will not be awarded.
Ms Sue Stoessl, an advertising consultant who recently became
director-general of the Market Research Society, believes that no one
planning to finance Channel 5 with advertising will be successful.
Ms Stoessl, who has been advising Northern Independent Producers, believes
that only a subscription service stands a chance of being viable.

FT  21 APR 92 / Mills rejects criticism of SFO policies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A STRONG defence of the record of the Serious Fraud Office has been made by
Mrs Barbara Mills QC, its director, as she leaves to become director of
public prosecutions.
Mrs Mills, who takes over as DPP today, rejects criticism of both the use of
the SFO's powers to compel people under investigation to answer questions
and its overall prosecution policy.
Mrs Mills denies in Law Society Gazette that the operation of the SFO's
powers has proved draconian. During her 17-month tenure as director, no
complaints were received about their use.
Of the notices issued last year, 73 per cent were issued to willing
interviewees, she writes. In such cases, often involving bankers and
accountants, the notices enabled them to talk freely to SFO investigators.
Mrs Mills also denies that SFO adopted a 'scatter gun' approach in its
prosecutions, charging defendants with too wide a range of charges.
'In the last 18 months, there have only been three SFO indictments which
contained more than 12 counts considered by a jury', she continues. 'In
about half of the cases, there were fewer than six counts for the jury's
consideration.' The SFO's policy remains to prosecute only central
allegations and defendants, she adds.
Mrs Mills also points to the steep rise in the SFO's workload. The number of
cases tackled by the SFO over the last 18 months has remained unchanged at
60, but the value of the alleged frauds has increased from Pounds 1.3bn to
more than Pounds 5bn, she said.
Mr George Staple, a former partner with Clifford Chance, the City law firm,
succeeds her as SFO director today.

Isle of Wight ferry operations recently came under the scrutiny of the
Monopolies and Mergers Commission after complaints that the services were,
mile for mile, among the most expensive in the world.

FT  21 APR 92 / Rover chief warns of Japanese surge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Financial Times Reporter
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SURVIVAL of Rover Group and other UK-based carmakers will increasingly
depend on exports as Japanese rivals increase their share of the UK market,
Mr George Simpson, Rover's chairman, said at a briefing in London.
Mr Simpson expects Japanese carmakers at least to double their present 11
per cent market share as they increase assembly in their UK factories. They
might even take as much as 30 per cent, he said.
He gave a warning that it was important for other European countries to
accept the increase in Japanese market share and to grant free access to
Japanese cars built in Britain.
Even so, France and Italy in particular were likely to continue to resist
any substantial increase in Japanese penetration of their car markets. 'If
the UK's car production rises to 2m,' he said, 'then all the present
producers could survive. As long as Rover continues making the same number
of cars at similar margins, we will be okay.'
If UK-assembled Japanese cars were given a fair chance to compete in the
rest of Europe, Rover's output should settle at about 500,000 a year. Rover
hoped to develop a distinctive image that would allow it to charge premium
prices compared with competitors with much higher volumes. However, he
warned that Rover's UK dealer network, which had fallen from 1,200 to 850
recently, would have to shrink further.
Rover expects to lose some of its market share of 14.4 per cent last year to
UK-produced Japanese cars this year, Mr Simpson said. He warned that output
would fall this year because although Rover hoped to increase exports, that
would not compensate for the UK losses and its determination to reduce stock
levels.
Mr Simpson said the UK industry was at a crossroads. 'It has a wonderful
opportunity but faces horrible risks. There are 12m customers in Europe and
there will still be 12m customers when the new (Japanese) factories set up.'
New car assembly plants were also planned for eastern Europe, Mr Simpson
said. He added: 'Being in the car business in the next 20 years will be a
very tough proposition.'

FT  21 APR 92 / Serbs seize more towns in Bosnian fighting
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE MOSLEM president of Bosnia-Hercegovina has made a bitter attack on the
Serbian-dominated federal Yugoslav army, as Serbs were reported to have
seized further towns in the newly independent republic.
The fresh turmoil coincided with confirmation that the US and the European
Community are considering breaking diplomatic ties with Belgrade to increase
pressure on Serbia to cease inflaming tension in Bosnia.
In his attack on the federal army, Mr Alija Izetbegovic, Bosnia's president,
said entire villages were being razed and towns destroyed and looted while
the 'murderers hide behind the backs of generals'.
He was responding to an open letter from a federal army general accusing the
president of 'personally orchestrating' attacks on military installations
and of 'declaring war against the Yugoslav Peoples' Army'. The general
warned that Mr Izetbegovic would face 'serious consequences' if a blockade
of barracks and weapons factories continued.
As more refugees fled trouble spots, Belgrade television said the Bosnian
town of Bratunac was overrun by Serb irregulars. Media in Sarajevo reported
earlier Serb troops had taken nearby Srebrenica.
The two predominantly Moslem towns are near the Serbian border, as are at
least four other towns taken by Serbs recently.
trying to create a corridor linking regions they hold in the north-west with
newly occupied areas along Bosnia's eastern borders with Serbia and its tiny
ally, Montenegro.
Croatian radio said the Serbian flag had been raised over Vogosca, an
industrial zone in Sarajevo, the capital of Bosnia. At least five people
were reported killed in fighting between Moslem and Serb forces for control
of the zone.
Fighting has nearly paralysed deliveries of food and medical supplies.
Sarajevo radio said milk was unavailable in the capital.
In the latest indication of US concern, the State Department said a
diplomatic break with Belgrade was being weighed at the highest levels of
the Bush administration. A break 'certainly is within the realm of
possibility', an official said.
Portugal, current EC president, said an EC break with Belgrade was being
considered. The EC was also considering pushing for a United Nations trade
embargo on Belgrade, a Portuguese official said. 'This is something that is
being considered at the level of the EC presidency,' the official said.
Yugoslav finance officials flew to the US yesterday to discuss foreign debt
payments and to try to head off efforts to end Yugoslavia's membership of
the International Monetary Fund, Reuter reports from Belgrade.
Mr Slavoljub Stanic, deputy finance minister, and Mr Dusan Vlatkovic,
National Bank governor, will hold talks with representatives of commercial
bank creditors in New York before an IMF session in Washington.
Mr Vlatkovic has said he wants to discuss rescheduling Yugoslavia's Dollars
15bn (Pounds 8.4bn) foreign debt. The team will also discuss the country's
IMF membership following the secession of Slovenia, Croatia and
Bosnia-Hercegovina.
'Yugoslavia simply cannot afford to lose the IMF. Without fresh money it is
strangled,' said a Yugoslav economist.
The mission has become more urgent because of a US drive to isolate Serbia,
Yugoslavia's biggest republic, both politically and economically unless it
ends what Washington calls interference in fighting in neighbouring Bosnia.

FT  21 APR 92 / Havel goes to Asia in search of markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY ROBINSON, East Europe Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Vaclav Havel, president of the Czech and Slovak Federal Republic, will
underline Czechoslovakia's search for wider markets and new sources of
investment capital during a week-long visit to Japan and South Korea which
begins in Tokyo today.
Over the last year Germany has emerged as the biggest foreign investor in
Czechoslovakia, accounting for a third of the more than 3,000 foreign joint
ventures and well over half of the nearly Dollars 1bn (Pounds 565m) foreign
equity investment in the country since the communist regime was ousted in
November 1989.
The more westerly Czech lands have also received substantial investment from
other European and US companies, including BSN and Air France, Nestle of
Switzerland, the UK-Dutch Unilever, ICI of the UK, and US multinationals
such as Procter and Gamble, Boeing and Dow Chemical.
Japanese investors, however, have remained cautious. The biggest investment
so far has been an indirect one by Asahi Glass, which holds a controlling
stake in Glaverbell, the Belgian-based glass company which last year
finalised a 'strategic alliance' with Sklo Union, the country's biggest
glass maker.
This is the biggest of only 10 projects involving Japanese companies in
Czechoslovakia to date.
Last year, however, Japan provided a Dollars 200m long-term credit, while
the Czechoslovak federal parliament last week cancelled the communist-era
trade agreement, which was signed in 1959 and was based on rigid inter-state
protocols no longer relevant to an economy in the throes of rapid
privatisation.
After meeting Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the Japanese prime minister, and Emperor
Akihito, the Czechoslovak president is expected to sign a new agreement
aimed at boosting trade.
Czechoslovakia last year exported goods worth only Dollars 71m to Japan,
mainly hops and glass, and imported electronic consumer goods, cars and
industrial products worth Dollars 124m.
On his way back, Mr Havel will visit South Korea for similar trade and
investment talks with the South Korean government, with whom diplomatic
relations were established only two years ago.
Czechoslovakia last year exported goods worth Dollars 8.6m to South Korea.

FT  21 APR 92 / Tough rules for Moscow's IMF safety net: Dollars 6bn rouble
fund to be discussed in Washington next Sunday
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RUSSIA will have to meet tough monetary policy conditions if it is to obtain
the planned Dollars 6bn (Pounds 3.3bn) safety net for the rouble which is
being prepared by the world's big industrialised countries.
The Dollars 6bn rouble stabilisation fund is part of the Dollars 24bn
package of international financial assistance for Russia announced earlier
this month. It will be one of the issues discussed by finance ministers and
central bank governors from the Group of Seven leading industrial countries
when they next meet in Washington on Sunday. It will also be the main agenda
item of another industrial country group - the Group of 10 - next Monday.
It is planned that the G10 (which confusingly is made up of 11 industrial
nations comprising the G7 plus the Netherlands, Belgium, Sweden and
Switzerland) should provide the funding for the stabilisation fund by
activating a dormant IMF financial mechanism known as the General
Arrangements to Borrow (GAB).
The Dollars 6bn rouble safety net would be established through an agreement
between Russia and the International Monetary Fund and administered by the
IMF. It is expected to take the form of a pledge of funds the IMF may draw
on in case of need rather than of a loan.
Some technical work has to be done on the stabilisation fund before the plan
can be approved by G10 ministers. But according to one senior western
monetary official, 'the real issue is whether the Russian government will be
able to comply with the conditions'.
Western capitals have shown some concern about the policies and activities
of the Russian central bank, with doubts about whether it will refuse
finance to bankrupt companies, and about its relations with the national
banks of the other former Soviet republics.
'I don't think anybody is very comfortable with what is happening on the
monetary side,' the official said. If the stabilisation fund gets off the
ground, 'we will really be lending Russia some reserves. We have therefore
got to get the proper conditionality.'
European officials expect the IMF will need further GAB financing to meet
its fast-growing obligations as a result of the liberalisation of eastern
Europe and the membership of the former Soviet republics.
The GAB in its present form dates back to 1983, when the G10 countries
agreed to provide up to Dollars 24bn to help the IMF through liquidity
shortages. It was envisaged as a support for the fund's efforts in dealing
with the 1980s international debt crisis, but was not needed for this
purpose. The facility was set up in 1962 to deal with monetary crises in the
G10 nations and was used to fund the UK's borrowing from the IMF in the
mid-1970s.

<TEXT>
ROMANIA'S Supreme Court overturned the acquittal of 21 former Communist
party bosses blamed for mass killings during the 1989 revolt and yesterday
sentenced them to jail terms totalling 255 years, Reuter reports from
Bucharest.
State prosecutors had appealed against the earlier acquittal of the
associates of Stalinist dictator Nicolae Ceausescu, who was overthrown and
executed in the December 1989 revolt.
None of the 21 was present when the court announced the appeal verdict and
fresh jail terms ranging from eight to 16 years on charges related to the
deaths of 1,033 people as a result of violent attempts to crush the
uprising.
'The Supreme Court rules that the 21 politburo members are guilty of
aggravated murder and complicity in aggravated murder,' Mr Valeriu
Bogdanescu, the court's vice-president said. 'All other rulings related to
this matter are cancelled.'
Legal sources said the former communist chiefs, who first came to trial in
July 1990, had no further right to appeal.
The court sentenced Ceausescu's adviser Silviu Curticeanu, former foreign
minister Ion Totu and former trade minister Ana Muresan to 16 years. Another
ex-foreign minister, Stefan Andrei, got 14 years, as did party ideologist
Dumitru Popescu and six others. The remaining 10 received sentences of eight
to 11 years.

<TEXT>
RUSSIA has ordered a military atomic plant to shut down two of its three
reactors as a danger to civilian health and the environment, a government
spokesman said yesterday, Reuter reports from Moscow.
The plant in Krasnoyarsk, a central Siberian city of 1m people, produces
weapons-grade plutonium. Two of its old-fashioned reactors cooled by water
taken from and pumped back into a big waterway were ordered to close within
months.
The Yenisey river, already heavily polluted by industry in a region where
millions of people live, flows 1,250 miles through Siberia. Local
authorities had complained of danger to health and the environment in towns
nearby.
Plutonium, a fission fuel for nuclear weapons and reactors, acts as a deadly
poison by collecting in bones and altering white blood-cell production.
The decision was the latest in a series of safety measures reflecting expert
consensus that Russia's nuclear technology is outmoded and dangerous.
It comes less than a month after a nuclear accident released radioactive gas
near the nation's second city, St Petersburg.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Russian congress, the Communist-dominated parliament that last week
refused to recognise the Soviet collapse, yesterday acknowledged
establishment of the Commonwealth of Independent States, AP reports from
Moscow.
On a vote of 548-158 the Congress of People's Deputies adopted a resolution
affirming Russia's membership in the commonwealth, which was created last
December.
The vote was a victory for President Boris Yeltsin, who has encountered
stiff opposition from lawmakers hostile to his market reforms, his sweeping
powers and his efforts to co-operate with other former Soviet republics
within the new commonwealth.
In a largely symbolic protest vote on Friday, the congress refused to
recognise the Soviet collapse or accept responsibility for fulfilling arms
control and other treaties signed by the former Soviet government.
It reversed itself yesterday, accepting the commonwealth as a 'new legal and
political form of voluntary union among sovereign states'.
The decision by the Russian parliament is unlikely, however, to defuse
tensions with other former Soviet republics. President Leonid Kravchuk of
Ukraine yesterday raised the stakes in a territorial dispute with Russia by
warning that a proposed referendum on Crimean independence could lead to
tragedy and bloodshed, Reuter reports from Kiev.
'A referendum is the tragic path towards a schism in the Crimea. And what
that schism would bring, what misfortunes it would cause for the people of
the peninsula and others besides, no one may dare to predict,' Mr Kravchuk
said.
The Black Sea peninsula of Crimea was handed from Russia to Ukraine in 1954
as a gift to mark 300 years of union. Since the breakup of the union last
year some Russians have questioned the legality of the transfer, raising
Ukrainian fears that Moscow could try to claim the territory back.

FT  21 APR 92 / Aid for Russia: lessons from the Marshall Plan
</HEADLINE>

'ECONOMIC assistance might turn the scale between stability and further
disintegration next winter. . . by tempting food and goods to market,
restoring the purchasing power of wages and increasing the incentive to
produce more.'
This quote could have been lifted from any of the many articles advocating
generous western financial assistance to aid the economic reconstruction of
former Soviet republics. In fact it appeared in July 1947 in the Economist
magazine, a few weeks after US secretary of state George Marshall first
proposed his aid package.
Europe's post-war economic recovery turned out, in fact, to be dramatically
successful. By 1951, average national income per head had risen to more than
10 per cent above their pre-war levels, an achievement not matched between
1914 and the great depression.
Yet it is surprisingly hard to pin down the role of Marshall aid in fuelling
this recovery. While most countries had rapid growth rates, there is little
correlation between the amount of aid a country received and its rate of
economic growth. West German industrial output rose by a remarkable 312 per
cent between 1947 and 1951; but Germany received a below-average Marshall
aid allocation.
It was the nature and not the quantity of aid that was more important for
the pace of Europe's recovery, according to research by Mr Barry Eichengreen
and Mr Marc Uzan to be published in the next issue of Economic Policy.
Countries across Europe had suffered extensive damage to their
infrastructure, needed new investment to shift production to domestic uses
and were short of foreign exchange reserves to buy imports. But the total
resource flow - Dollars 13bn between 1948 and 1951, more than Dollars 70bn
(Pounds 39.5bn) in today's prices and averaging only 2.5 per cent of gross
national product - was too small to provide a significant boost to either
investment or government spending.
Countries with the largest current deficits tended to receive more aid. But
there was no strong link between national growth rates and either the size
of these deficits or rates of investment growth.
The importance of Marshall aid was in restoring financial and political
stability and speeding the liberalisation of production and prices. Post-war
prices were at unsustainably low levels, consumer goods were scarce while
large budget deficits threatened inflation. Producers were better off
hoarding their goods than selling them. Economically the solution was clear:
price controls had to go, wage demands moderated and budgets balanced. But
the political difficulties of higher prices, lower real wages for workers
and higher taxes were great.
Marshall aid, while modest, eased the fiscal constraint facing national
governments and made it easier to mollify fractious interest groups. Equally
important were the conditions attached to aid. Countries were required to
maintain workable stabilisation policies, but specific targets for monetary
and fiscal policy were less important than pressure to decontrol prices,
reduce trade barriers and co-operate to revive intra-European trade.
Russia's reformers are today facing similar problems. The recent decision by
the Group of Seven industrialised countries to grant a Dollars 24bn package
of aid and trade credits to the Russian government has revived hopes of a
Marshall-style solution. But the Marshall Plan analogy may be misleading.
Post-war Europe had experience of a private economy: the domestic debate was
over types of market economy - more or less state intervention or
redistribution - rather than whether to build a private market economy or
return to state control. The G7 countries may be able to apply pressure for
faster liberalisation and a revival of inter-republic trade. But if the
constituency favouring a painful shift to a market economy is weak, Dollars
24bn is unlikely to tip the balance.

LIBYAN leader Colonel Muammer Gadaffi is due to meet Egyptian President
Hosni Mubarak today to discuss the United Nations sanctions imposed to back
demands for extradition of the two alleged Lockerbie bombers, Egyptian
officials announced, AP reports from Cairo.
It will be Col Gadaffi's first trip out of Libya since the UN Security
Council voted to cut off air travel and impose arms and diplomatic embargoes
on Libya on March 31. The sanctions went into force last Wednesday.
Libya told foreign journalists yesterday to stop reporting from Tripoli and
continued tit-for-tat expulsions of European diplomats. The air embargo held
for a sixth day after Syria decided against sending an airliner to the
Libyan capital.
The Egyptian officials in Cairo who announced Col Gadaffi's visit did not
disclose how he would reach the summit site, at Sidi el-Barrani, a military
airfield 50 miles east of the border on Egypt's Mediterranean coast.
Col Gadaffi could fly to the Libyan city of Tobruk west of the border, drive
across the frontier and fly or drive to Sidi el-Barrani. That would not
violate the UN sanctions.

THE US said yesterday that some US military equipment sold to Saudi Arabia
was later illegally transferred to Iraq, Syria and Bangladesh but denied it
secretly allowed the transfers, Reuter reports.
The State Department said the Saudis transferred equipment to Iraq in 1986
and in 1991 to Syria and Bangladesh, both of which were members of the
US-led coalition against Iraq in the Gulf war.
The department was responding to claims that the US administration secretly
let Saudi Arabia supply US-made weapons to Iraq and other countries to avoid
restrictions imposed by Congress.

FT  21 APR 92 / Washington downbeat on Gatt breakthrough: Hope still alive
in Brussels as EC-US summit offers last chance for a 1992 Uruguay Round
settlement
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THERE are still hopes in Brussels that tomorrow's EC-US summit in Washington
could deliver the breakthrough needed for a Uruguay Round deal liberalising
broad new swathes of world trade. However, the mood in Washington yesterday
was downbeat.
Mr Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission, accompanied by Mr
Anibal Cavaco Silva, prime minister of Portugal, which currently holds the
EC presidency, are meeting President George Bush in what is widely seen as
the last chance this year to get a new General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade.
The US presidential election campaign is likely to impede further attempts
to get a deal before a new administration takes office in January. Even if a
political agreement is reached this week, it will take at least two months
to resolve the details.
Brussels was last week talking down prospects of success. After more than
five years of negotiations, missed deadlines and megaphone diplomacy, plus
the past six months of false dawns, Commission officials are understandably
prudent and tight-lipped. But some senior Brussels officials genuinely
believe a deal is within reach, and that public caution is simply to magnify
the achievement.
The key to an overall agreement remains an EC-US understanding on farm trade
subsidies, which all sides believe is vital to unlock progress on remaining
differences over services liberalisation and market access.
There have been strong hints, but no firm evidence, that the US is willing
to allow EC subsidies to farmers as compensation for heavy price cuts
Brussels plans as part of its farm reform plan. The conditions are likely to
be that the Community furnishes proof that the compensation scheme restricts
production, and that the payments start falling after six years.
The EC has maintained it cannot meet Gatt subsidy reduction targets, and
that reform of its Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) is at risk, unless Gatt
allows these payments into its 'green box' for subsidies which do not
distort trade.
The political core of this issue, however, is the extent to which the EC can
offer open-ended guarantees of a livelihood to its hard-pressed smaller
farmers.
Some Brussels officials also believe that the EC could agree to restrain the
volume of its subsidised exports - in addition to even higher cuts on the
amount of subsidy - as long as the US restrains exports of corn gluten, a
cheap cereals substitute for animal feed.
The price of cereals, the US's main target for subsidy cuts, is due to be
cut by 30 per cent over three years under CAP reform, well over the Gatt
target of 20 per cent internal subsidy cuts over six years. But byproducts,
such as corn gluten, can undercut even the lower price level.
The EC also wants export subsidies cuts to fall on sectors rather than
products. Otherwise, high-added-value products such as cheese, in the dairy
sector, would be hit in the same way as, say, skimmed-milk powder.
Reports that the preliminary meeting last week in London produced no
progress has, however, depressed expectations in Washington.
Mr Cal Cohen, vice-president of the Emergency Committee for American Trade,
said no deal on agriculture was possible unless the EC agreed to limit the
tonnage of its subsidised exports.
However, there is new talk of 'bundling' the agriculture and services
negotiations to exchange EC concessions on agriculture for US concessions on
services.
Finally, the EC is holding out for a 'peace clause,' through which the US
would undertake to set aside use of its trade law arsenal and settle
bilateral disputes through Gatt. It is unclear whether the EC would settle
for the generally improved bilateral trade climate that a Uruguay Round
settlement would bring.

FT  21 APR 92 / Russia eases monetary policy: State industry sector to be
restructured as reforms enter new phase
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
RUSSIAN economic reform is entering a new stage which will determine whether
or not the country succeeds in creating a market economy. Monetary
discipline will be relaxed in favour of an attempt to restructure the
massive state industrial sector, and to allow the economy to grow again next
year after four years of decline.
Key ministers said in interviews with the FT that they are encouraged by
what they see as a victory over attempts by the Russian Congress of Peoples'
Deputies to destroy the reform process. But they have been constrained to
modify their tight monetary policy, to expand credits and to loosen their
targets on inflation. Mr Yegor Gaidar, first deputy prime minister in charge
of reform, said: 'We cannot stand three more years of negative growth: one
more year is possible, this year. In the longer term, the structural agony
of this economy will create an impossible situation - and so we must start
economic growth rather fast. We must get growth.'
Mr Boris Yeltsin, the Russian president, met leaders of groups in the
Congress yesterday and reportedly told them he would step down as head of
the government and put forward the name of a new prime minister in three
months. A senior government official said he expected the name to be that of
Mr Gaidar.
The specific elements of the second stage of reforms, after a first quarter
dominated by efforts to squeeze spending and bring down the budget deficit,
are:
An acceptance that inflation will remain high. Mr Gaidar said that 'we hope
to get it down to a rate of 3 per cent a month by the end of the year' -
that is, about 40 per cent on an annual basis. However, Mr Georgy Matiukhin,
chairman of the Russian Central Bank, said yesterday he would be content to
see inflation coming down to 5 or 6 per cent a month from its present
estimated level of some 30-40 per cent.
A rejection of the aim to determine a new fixed exchange rate for the rouble
in favour of a 'crawling peg' strategy. This would allow the rouble to
decline against hard currencies in line with inflation differentials,
starting from a range against the dollar which Mr Gaidar has suggested could
be about 40-50. The Central Bank rate is presently 110 to the dollar, with
the free market rate about 150. This would accommodate inflationary
pressures, leaving the fight against inflation to domestic monetary
instruments.
The use of a mixture of the stick and carrot to restructure industry, where
production has fallen in the first quarter by more than 13 per cent,
according to government figures, and where inter-enterprise debt has
ballooned to near Rbs900bn. Mr Andrei Nechayev, the economics minister, said
the Central Bank would make available Rbs200bn to the commercial banks for
soft credits to industry. He would, however, also expect a Decree on
Bankruptcy to be signed soon by Mr Yeltsin, and that 'if we had 10 or 15
bankruptcies, that would give a good possibility to change enterprise
behaviour'. Mr Nechayev also said Rbs42bn will go in soft credits to help
the conversion of defence enterprises, with a further Rbs40bn to pay social
costs to workers of those enterprises where state orders for arms have been
stopped.
A continued determination to raise energy prices by the middle of this year,
and to achieve parity with world energy prices - especially oil prices - by
the end of 1993. The government said it had raised the price of petrol at
the pumps from between Rbs1 and Rbs1.3 a litre to between Rbs5 and Rbs7 a
litre. Both Mr Gaidar and Mr Nechayev said the intention to raise the price
per tonne of oil to between Rbs2,000 and Rbs2,600 by the middle of this year
was still on track. Mr Nechayev said the government was considering imposing
high rates of tax - up to 95 per cent - on producers who increased prices
above Rbs2,600. The target of zero budget deficit has been dropped in favour
of an attempt to keep it below 5 per cent of gross national product over the
rest of this year.
Export quotas, increased because of the slump in domestic demand following
the liberalisation of prices in January, are soon to be replaced by export
tariffs. The quotas will be phased out by the end of the year, according to
Mr Pyotr Aven, chairman of the Committee on Foreign External Relations. An
import tax of 5-10 per cent is likely to be imposed this year.
The tense relations between the government and the Russian Central Bank have
been replaced by an uneasy consensus. This has seen the bank limit easy
credits and raise its discount rate to 50 per cent. The government has also
increasingly recognised the need, as Mr Gaidar put it, to 'remonetise' an
economy in which many workers have not been paid for lack of cash.
Admitting that the government had earlier hoped to replace the bank
leadership, Mr Nechayev said: 'We don't fully believe in the top managers of
the Central Bank, but if they resign now, it won't necessarily be better
than if they stay.' Mr Yeltsin has prepared a resolution which may come
before the Congress today, proposing that he, rather than the Russian
parliament, appoint the Central Bank chairman 'with the agreement of the
Supreme Soviet of the Russian federation'.

FT  21 APR 92 / Bells and balloons greet Expo in Seville
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER BRUCE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BELLS of the city of Seville rang out in unison just after midday
yesterday as King Juan Carlos of Spain officially opened the Expo 92
Universal Exposition, which he called 'the greatest exposition in history'.
There was a nervous cheer from the 1,800 invited guests as two huge plumes
of red smoke billowed from the kilns of the 15th-century Cartuja monastery
at the Expo site to signal the start of the six-month exhibition. Balloons
carrying flags of all the 110 participating countries rose into the sky.
The nerves were understandable. Expo has been plagued by a series of fires -
the last destroying the thatched pavilion of the South Pacific islands late
last week - as workers hurried to complete the Pounds 1.1bn site.
More than 18m people, organisers say, will visit the futuristic steel,
glass, bronze and wood pavilions between now and October 12.
Expo 92 is the first big spectacle of Spain's 1992 celebrations to mark the
500th anniversary of Christopher Columbus's discovery of the New World. The
Olympic Games in Barcelona in July and August will be the other big
international event.
The exhibition, which has generated investment worth some Pounds 5.6bn on
the site and in infrastructure around the Andalucian capital, is the biggest
ever staged. Not even the shooting and wounding by police of three people
demonstrating against the fair in Seville on Sunday, and 20 more arrests
yesterday, managed to dispel the general air of relief that the giant
exhibition was finally under way. Some 10,000 police and 3,000 private
security men were on duty in and around Seville and on the Expo site.

FT  21 APR 92 / British companies win record 127 Queen's awards
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH COMPANIES have won a record 127 awards for exports in the latest
Queen's awards for export and technology, which are announced today.
The number of applications for export awards was the highest for 13 years,
reflecting companies' determination to seek new markets while domestic
demand is slow.
Although Britain's biggest enterprises are heavily represented, the winners
include such smaller companies as Fortnum and Mason, the luxury London
retailer, which has opened outlets in Japan since it began its export
department in 1981.
J Barbour and Sons, best known for its outdoor clothing made of oiled
cotton, now sells in 25 markets while Grants of Dalvey has moved on from
bagpipe manufacturing to make sporrans and hip flasks popular in Germany,
Japan and 23 other countries.
The Queen's awards were introduced in 1966. They are made on the advice of
the prime minister helped by a committee which comprises representatives of
industry, commerce, trade unions and the government.
Rolls-Royce won for its sales of aero-engines and British Steel's general
steels division also won an export award. ICI won three awards, two Queen's
awards for technology and one for exporting purification technology.
The smallest winner is Associated Timber Services, with just nine staff.
UK-based Japanese companies which won awards include Nissan Motor, the car
maker, and Yamazaki Machinery, a producer of machine tools. Both export to
Japan.
The BBC won one of 38 technology awards for the development of the Nicam
digital television system, while Portakabin was rewarded for its development
of luxury portable offices.
Electronics and computers dominate the technology awards list. Winners
include IBM and Oxford University - their jointly developed computer
programming language is used by financial services companies - and Oxford
Lasers, whose copper laser is powerful enough to guide telescopes.

FT  21 APR 92 / Survey of Seattle and Puget Sound (7): Highways to
frustration - Transport is a problem in one of the US's most congested areas
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TRANSPORTATION and Seattle go hand in hand. The city, after all, has its
origins as a port, servicing both the lumber business and the fishing
industry. Today, its largest single employer is a manufacturer of aircraft.
But familiarity breeds, if not contempt, a distinct lack of contentment.
Talk to a Seattleite for any length of time, and comparisons with California
inevitably crop up. Like many big Californian cities, Seattle is physically
well-endowed, and - again like California - it has seen fairly explosive
growth in recent times.
What Seattleites seem to fear is that their city will develop all the
debilitating urban problems which dog, say, Los Angeles. The result is a
degree of overt 'protectionism' rarely seen in the US, coupled with a
feverish desire to control development for several decades ahead. Nowhere
does this paranoia surface more noticeably than over transportation issues.
There is no doubt that the city has a physical problem. The downtown area,
into which much of the daily commuter traffic feeds, is situated at the
narrowest point of the isthmus, and the city is bounded by water on both
sides. This natural handicap has been compounded by the fact that the
inter-state highways - route 5 which runs north-south and the ubiquitous
route 90 which divides the state east-west before going on to Boston - were
laid down in fairly kamikaze fashion. They carelessly bisected communities
and, to this day, produce ghastly interchange problems. (Locals have duly
termed one particularly vicious portion of Interstate-5 passing through the
city centre, 'the Mercer weave').
True, the traffic jams seem to pale in comparison with either New York or
Los Angeles. Nevertheless, Seattle-Everett is usually ranked within the top
half-dozen 'most-congested' areas in the US. Accordingly, given that for
geographical and political reasons the supply of principal highways is
probably fixed in the foreseeable future, efforts are being concentrated on
'demand' management.
Most local planners stress that this should be seen in the context of
Washington's 'growth management' strategy - legislation which was enacted in
1990, and which is designed to co-ordinate planning between different areas,
and between land use and transportation. This broad backdrop is still
evolving, and will continue to do so for many months ahead. Nevertheless, on
the transport front specifically, some problems are pressing and initiatives
have taken shape.
One of the most prominent problems centres on car pooling. In itself, the
idea is scarcely new - but Seattle is pushing the notion with rare ferocity.
Last May, Washington's governor, Booth Gardner, signed into law a
requirement that the most populated counties - including King, Pierce and
Snohomish - develop trip reduction plans for single occupancy vehicles in
conjunction with local employers. Employers must meet minimum goals for SOV
(single occupancy vehicle) trip reduction set out in the legislation -
namely 15 per cent by 1995, 25 per cent by 1997 and 35 per cent by 1999.
This, of course, is easier said than done - and the practicalities of how
such goals might be achieved and monitored at individual employer level are
still being thrashed out.
Less clear-cut is whether Seattle requires a new, comprehensive rapid
transit system - and, if so, how much money should be devoted to such a
project. At present, aside from road access, and a complex one-way street
system within the downtown area, the Municipality of Metropolitan Seattle
(METRO) operates fairly extensive bus-based services within the city and its
suburbs. These range from waterfront streetcars to a free 'Transit'
operation in the downtown area. The latter service makes use of a 1.3-mile
tunnel under part of the city centre, and remains resolutely bus-oriented
although rail lines were laid when the project was built. There is also a
monorail operated by the City of Seattle, which links downtown with the
Seattle Center.
Nevertheless, given the transport constraints and the projected growth
rates, planners have begun to focus on a major new rapid transit system in
recent years. First thoughts centred on light-rail possibilities, a scheme
which could have cost up to Dollars 11bn over three decades.
This, under the 'Vision 2020' plan, would then be augmented by new
'high-occupancy' vehicle lanes on the highways for people car-pooling or
riding buses, and an enlarged passenger ferry service.
But this plan, in turn, has spurred vociferous debate over whether the money
could be better spent, and whether part of Seattle's problem involves the
lack of linkage between certain high-growth suburbs - which might invite
different sorts of solutions. (Some planners note that the local transport
problem is given an extra twist by the fact that Boeing is the largest
employer in the city, and tends to move its staff to different production
facilities as different aircraft get built. This, in turn, makes traffic
flows somewhat unpredictable).
So where does this leave the rapid transit scheme? The initial timetable
suggested that the issue could come to a vote in late-1992, but that has
certainly been pushed back. Some local observers believe that it may even be
deferred beyond 1993.
Looking beyond communications within the immediate area, issues are equally
fraught. There has been much talk of 'bullet train' possibilities on the
Vancouver-Seattle-Portland stretch of the West Coast. Again, while there is
a good deal of travel between these points and many locals would like to see
the amount of commuter air traffic reduced, the arguments are not clearcut.
Critics point to the simple advisability of having a car in Vancouver and
Portland - cities which are geographically spread - and note that the
geography of the region would make construction of 'bullet track' a tough
task.
But contention over these issues pales in comparison with the furore of
Seattle's air transportation facilities. Again, the region's growth coupled
with some natural restrictions, have prompted fears that Sea-Tac Airport -
operated by the Port of Seattle - could soon face a capacity crunch. At
present, the airport handles more than 16m passengers a year. By 2000, runs
the argument, that number could rise to 25m, and by 2020, 40m. If these
forecasts are correct, capacity would be exhausted well before 2000.
Advocates of expansion put their case another way, too. Flights in and out
of the airport stood at around 355,000 in 1990, about 40 per cent being
commuter flights. Once the figure tops 1,100 a day, bottlenecks tend to
develop. At present, the average daily number is in the 900s.
Just to compound the pessimists' worries, the two existing runways at
Sec-Pac are parallel and close. This means that only one is usable in all
weather conditions, while it is reckoned that 'poor' weather persists for
about 45 per cent of the year.
Accordingly, after years of angst, a preferred solution which has been
proposed by the Puget Sound Air Transportation Committee, comprising three
elements:
The addition of a third, all-weather runway at Sea-Tac, by 2000;
The use of an existing jet runway at Paine Field in Everett for commercial
service by 2000, possibly making this the home for many of the commuter
services; and
The possible development of a smaller, 'reliever' airport in the southern
Puget Sound area.
Although the business community is broadly in favour of this plan, the
public outcry has been angry and extensive. Objections range from the
rational - suggesting that there are better alternatives - to the purely
emotional. All, however, centre on fears about noise, pollution and
secondary traffic problems which could flow from the plan.

IN THE computer industry, Seattle is 'Software City'. Home to Microsoft, the

centre for software entrepreneurs who have founded hundreds of small
companies in the region over the past decade.
Washington state's software industry is now a thriving Dollars 3bn-a-year
business and the computer software industry is the fastest growing segment
of the state's economy. In 1980, 14 software companies employed 566 people
in the state, according to the Washington state department of trade and
economic development. By 1990, there were more than 500 software companies
in Washington employing 9,600 people and the numbers have continued to rise.
The growth of Seattle's software industry begs comparison with California's
Silicon Valley with its burgeoning electronics and computer industries.
Indeed there are many similarities between the two West Coast regions that
point to the key elements of a seedbed for high-technology industry growth.
Washington and California have strong reputations for good 'quality of
life'; a significant draw for young talented people. Even the geographies of
the San Francisco peninsula and the Puget Sound are alike, both being
virtually surrounded by water.
Equally significant, perhaps, is the established infrastructure of both
regions providing all the services that an emerging high-technology company
might need. In Seattle, these range from freelance programmers to disk
duplicating services; package designers and courier companies; lawyers and
venture capitalists.
Also like Silicon Valley, Seattle has a few large established companies that
form the core of the region's growth industry. In Seattle these are Boeing
Computer Services, Microsoft and Aldus.
In Silicon Valley companies such as Hewlett-Packard and Intel have spawned
hundreds of 'spin-off' companies formed by former employees. To date, the
spin-off phenomenon has been relatively limited in Seattle. There have been
only a dozen or so spin-offs from Microsoft, for example, according to local
industry officials. Nonetheless, the largest software companies provide a
prime source of talent for new ventures.
Universities also play a key role in the high-technology infrastructure.
However, in this regard Seattle lacks the abundance of the Silicon Valley.
The University of Washington, in Seattle, has close links with local
software companies, but it can provide only a fraction of the graduates that
the industry needs.
The software industry's growth has outstripped the supply of qualified
graduates from Washington state's universities and colleges, according to
the Washington Software Association, an industry group representing software
developers in the state, and vocational schools. Future growth of the
industry will be constrained by the limited supply of candidates in
technical, marketing and management fields, a study performed by the
industry group concluded.
To address the need for increased numbers of graduates, the WSA has launched
programmes to link the educational community with the software industry. All
economic indicators for the software industry show opportunities for
continued growth and expansion.
'Our job is to be globally competitive. To do this, we must have a trained,
skilled workforce, and there is no better way to find that workforce than by
growing it at home, through Washington state's educational system,' says
Paul Brainerd, president of Aldus, a leader in the field of desktop
publishing software based near Seattle, and chairman of the Washington
industry group's education committee.
WSA aims to encourage Washington high school students to consider a career
in the software industry and is also sponsoring scholarships at Washington
University.
Yet for Microsoft, the flagship of Washington's software industry,
attracting talent is hardly a problem. Last year the company was inundated
with more than 10,000 job applications a month. From these the company chose
about 4,000 new employees, bringing its world-wide workforce to about 11,000
including about 4,400 at its Redmond headquarters in an 'East Side' suburb
of Seattle.
Moreover, 64 per cent of Microsoft's recruits last year came from the state
of Washington, suggesting that the leading software company gets the lion's
share of new graduates in the state with computer science and related
disciplines.
Indeed , Microsoft is so much bigger than any other software company in
Washington that its fortunes drive the growth trend in the state's software
industry. Last year, Microsoft's revenues more than doubled to Dollars
1.8bn. For fiscal 1992, ending this June, analysts expect Microsoft's
revenues to jump to Dollars 2.7bn.
Microsoft's presence in Seattle is highly visible. The company occupies a
260-acre campus with some 22 buildings in addition to its manufacturing
operations and other offices throughout the region.
Microsoft's growth over the past year has been based largely upon the
success of 'Windows', a program that gives IBM-compatible personal computers
a graphical interface similar to that of Apple Computer's Macintosh. Since
the introduction of Windows 3.0 in June 1990, more than 9m copies have been
sold.
This month, Microsoft launched a new version of Windows. The Seattle company
is now, however, facing a significant challenge from International Business
Machines, a former software development partner, which last month introduced
its own personal computer operating system software to compete directly with
Windows.
Microsoft is also involved in a potentially serious legal dispute with Apple
Computer, which claims that Windows infringes copyrights on its Macintosh
computer software. And in addition, Microsoft is the focus of an anti-trust
investigation being conducted by the US Justice Department.
Nonetheless, Microsoft is expected to maintain its leadership role in the
personal computer software market.
With the growth of Microsoft, and the rising value of the company's stock,
many of the company's employees have become paper millionaires. Bill Gates,
chairman and co-founder of Microsoft, is now reckoned to be the richest man
in the United States, based upon his substantial shareholdings in the
company.
Feeding some of this wealth back into the Seattle economy, Microsoft's
several millionaires are said to be a ready source of venture capital funds
for new companies in the region.

Northwest - Trade and tourism

<TEXT>
TRADE has always been part of Seattle's raison-d'etre. On a grey day in
1851, goes the story, a schooner headed for San Francisco stopped in the
area and inquired about picking up timber. Thus, a port was born.
Today, according to economists at Security Pacific Bank, Northwest ports
handle more than Dollars 125bn of total annual trade volume. Not all of
this, of course, feeds through the Seattle region: Portland tends to lead
where grain and car shipments are concerned, and Vancouver is the obvious
entry-exit point for Canada. Seattle and Tacoma, by contrast, have developed
a strong presence in terms of containerised freight, while Sec-Tac Airport
has a growing role in air-cargo trade.
Statistics on movement and type of goods has been usefully compiled by the
Trade Development Alliance of Greater Seattle. In terms of 1990 exports, it
has estimated that companies based in King County exported almost Dollars
14.5bn worth of goods, while the state figure was Dollars 24.6bn. The
largest single component was 'transportation equipment' - mainly aircraft
and aircraft parts - underlining Boeing's dominant role in the region.
This made up 79.5 per cent of King County exports, and was followed by
services (ranging from accounting to real estate) with 8.8 per cent.
After that came lumber products with 2.36 per cent, machinery with 1.5 per
cent and then instruments, food, fishing, and electric, all at around 1 per
cent. The five largest destination countries for all exports were (in
descending order) Japan, Canada, the UK, Korea and Germany.
For transportation products alone, this changes somewhat: the list becomes
the UK, Japan, Germany, Australia, and China/Hong Kong.
But look at trading partners on a two-way basis, and the picture changes
again. For 'waterborne trade', which obviously slants the picture towards
the Pacific Rim business but gives some indication of where the ports find
their customers, the total value of Seattle's imports and exports in 1991
was Dollars 25.4bn. Nearly half of this - Dollars 12.2bn - related to Japan.
Next, with 15 per cent, came Korea, and after that, Taiwan, China and Hong
Kong. Add in air cargo, and total two-way trade for Seattle is put at
Dollars 30bn.
There are, of course, dozens of ports in the region - many privately
operated - while, on the express package courier side, Seattle is home to
Airborne Express.
But there is no doubt that the two main players in Seattle-based trade are
the Port of Seattle, which also runs Sea-Tac International Airport, and its
neighbour to the south, the Port of Tacoma.
The Port of Seattle is the larger operation. In 1991, for example, operating
revenues are estimated to have been Dollars 148.6m, up by 2.1 per cent over
the previous year in spite of the Gulf War repercussions. The Port of
Tacoma, by contrast, saw revenues of Dollars 46.3m in 1990.
However, this relative advantage was largely due to the Port of Seattle's
aviation business. Its marine revenues were put at Dollars 46.6m last year,
compared with Dollars 57.8m in 1990 - making it only a little larger than
its southerly neighbour. In terms of container traffic, Seattle harbour is
estimated to have handled 1.15m TEUs (20-foot equivalent units) last year.
Tacoma's figure was nearer 1m, but is forecasting 1.1m for the present 12
months.
This near-50:50 split for the area's container traffic is something of an
achievement for Tacoma. Five years ago, its business was about two-thirds of
Seattle's.
Clearly, rivalry does exist, and upstart Tacoma has poached a number of
former customers - such as Sealand - from its neighbour.
Some locals attribute the shift in business to Seattle's complacency, and a
somewhat bureaucratic environment. More objectively, one might note that
Tacoma has considerable space advantages - aided considerably by a recent
Indian land settlement.
In spite of a recent lull in growth, the port is suggesting that it could
see some 2.8m TEUs handled by 2010, and has drawn up a phased expansion plan
on this assumption. Seattle, too, expects growth rates of a similar order,
and has its own container terminal development plan.
Meanwhile, the Port of Seattle's attempts to cajole its rival into more
co-operation over pricing and other issues, appear to have fallen on stony
ground. Tacoma officials remain diplomatic about the competition, but argue
that, if business is not fought out between the two local ports, it could be
lost to external rivals. Better that someone switches from Seattle to
Tacoma, they claim, than from either of these ports to, say, LA-Long Beach.
Where the Port of Seattle does take a clear leading role is in the
development of air cargo. This has risen fairly sharply, from just 7,400
metric tons in 1986, to 20,000 metric tons by 1990.
The growth in air freight overall, meanwhile, was marked during the mid-80s
but has reduced more recently. In 1987, for example, domestic air freight
increased by 21 per cent, and international by 30 per cent; in 1990, these
rates were down to 7.1 and 13 per cent respectively.
Tourism, meanwhile, ranks as the area's fourth largest industry - and one
glance at the snow-covered mountains, abundant supply of outdoor activities
in the state, and picturesque coastline makes it clear why.
Some 530,000 international visitors are estimated to have passed through
Seattle and King County in 1990, and total travel expenditures were put at
Dollars 2.2bn.
In local employment terms, this is plainly significant. More Over 43,000
full-time employees are reckoned to derive their livelihoods from the travel
industry. Tourists also produced Dollars 88.7m of sales tax receipts and
around Dollars 7m in local room taxes in 1990.
The region is fairly well-served in terms of facilities. A new convention
centre opened in the late-80s, although some argue that this is still too
small. Meanwhile, there are more than over 7,000 hotel rooms in downtown
Seattle, and some 20,000 or more in Seattle-King County. That, say locals,
is about right at present - and the pricey room rates seem to back up this
contention. There are, however, fears that if more capacity comes on stream
 -as seems likely - a measure of oversupply could develop.

FT  21 APR 92 / Survey of Seattle and Puget Sound (5): Growth takes up the
space - Real estate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONE GLANCE at Seattle's skyline, and the casual observer will fear the
worst.
The downtown area is dominated by several dozen skyscrapers, many ominously
high and gleamingly new. In today's recessionary climate, this would seem to
spell problems of unlet space, souring real estate loans, and all the domino
effects which have savaged the US banking and insurance industries
nationwide.
In reality, Seattle's recent growth and resistance to the worst recessionary
forces means that such problems - although not entirely absent - have been
significantly mitigated.
The Seattle office of Coldwell Banker, the Sears Roebuck subsidiary, reckons
that around 13.7 per cent of the downtown commercial office space is vacant,
compared with a peak figure of around 18 per cent in 1988.
It suggests that vacancy rates have dropped during the past three years, and
then flipped back upwards to a smaller extent in 1991.
This is a simple function of supply and demand. Over the past three years,
downtown Seattle saw 4m square feet of new office space come on to the
market, principally in five large buildings. The market had been absorbing
around 1m sq ft a year, but this figure fell to about 250,000 sq ft last
year.
Locals attribute this last development to the economy - which, although far
from fullblown recession, finally felt some winds of change last year.
Boeing, for example, is still a very big factor in Seattle's economic
health, and its fortunes can even influence spin-off demand for office
accommodation.
The wave of bank mergers also cast an element of doubt over the real estate
market, although property experts remain relatively relaxed about the amount
of space which these deals may result in. Vis-a-vis the largest transaction
 -the merger between Security Pacific and Bank of America and its Washington
subsidiary, Seafirst - much is thought to depend on who buys the 86 SecPac
branches which BoA is required to divest and what sort of 'head office'
structure the purchaser takes on.
'Banking consolidation is the wild card,' says Boh Dickey, chief financial
officer at Safeco, the large Seattle-based multiline insurer, summing up the
general uncertainty.
Rental rates, meanwhile, have seen relatively little increase for almost a
decade. That said, while some foreclosures have occurred, there has been
nothing on the scale of the East Coast. Bank of America itself came to the
aid of one large local developer, acquiring the Columbia Seafirst Center,
Seattle's biggest single property with 1.4m square feet of office space.
Outside the downtown area, the office space situation is somewhat variable.
For example, in Bellevue, home of Microsoft and many other high-tech
businesses, the supply situation is viewed as significantly tighter than
downtown, with vacancy rates in single digits.
The real estate community, ever optimistic, seems hopeful that this
situation could pertain in downtown Seattle in a few years' time. It points
out that no new space is likely to come on stream until 1994 or 1995.
Meanwhile - and more speculatively - the turmoil in Hong Kong is prompting
some flow of Asian money into Vancouver. It is a small step, some suggest,
from there, down the coast to Seattle and San Francisco.
On the residential housing front, Seattle's traditional problems have been
supply, rather than demand-oriented. At the end of 1990, for example, it was
estimated that the city had about 250,000 housing units, of which half were
single family homes. Less than 5 per cent were believed to be vacant. About
half the city's households, meanwhile, were thought to be renting.
This tight balance between supply and demand, therefore, pushed up house
prices in the Eighties, and may also have contributed to a significant
homelessness problem. (Around 3,000 people a day are homeless in Seattle).
Equally inevitably, the present slowdown in economic growth has mitigated
the problem somewhat, although experience varies depending on area. In
general, prices have been softer in recent months, with the average price of
an existing home standing at around Dollars 164,000.

FT  21 APR 92 / Survey of Seattle and Puget Sound (4): Industrial mix
broadened - High-technology is reshaping Seattle's profile
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HIGH-TECHNOLOGY industries are reshaping Seattle's profile, broadening its
business mix far beyond its traditional reliance on timber and Boeing, the
world's leading manufacturer of civilian aircraft.
Microsoft, the world's leading manufacturer of computer software, is located
here, as is Aldus, the manufacturer of software for the printing industry
which coined the phrase 'desktop publishing'. McCaw Cellular, America's
largest cellular telephone operator, is a Seattle company. And the Puget
Sound area has become one of the leading US centres of the bio-technology
industry, with Immunex probably its best-known representative.
That said, Boeing remains the dominant business in the region. It employs
more than 100,000 people directly and a further 380,000 people are reckoned
to be indirectly dependent on the company, representing almost one out of
six jobs in the state of Washington.
The company's impact on the local community goes far beyond this. In 1992
Boeing expects to donate Dollars 25m in cash to the community, almost half
of it going on education, with a further Dollars 5m of contributions in
kind. Boeing employees themselves chip in to a 'good neighbour' fund, and
raised Dollars 22m last year.
Boeing will continue to underpin the regional economy for decades to come.
Its order book totals more than Dollars 90bn, more than three years' work on
civilian aircraft, and while there remain doubts about the robustness of
that tally over the next couple of years, the company's long-term future
looks bright, given expectations of solid growth in the world's demand for
aircraft over the next 20 years.
The same cannot be said for the timber industry of the Puget Sound region. A
furious row over the protection of the Northern Spotted Owl has sharply
reduced the cutting of timber from federally-owned land in the region and
caused great hardship to many small, independent loggers and mill-owners.
Private companies which own their own timber are largely exempt from the
restrictions (though they, too, cannot log around trees with spotted owl
nests) and in some cases have even benefited from the restrictions, because
these have led to rocketing timber prices.
Weyerhaeuser, the largest private owner of softwood timber in the world,
which has its headquarters at Tacoma, just south of Seattle, stands to
benefit in this way - although a lack of supplies from non-company sources
has forced it to close a number of plants in the Northwest, including its
pulp mill at Everett, just north of Seattle.
Seattle's growing importance as a high-technology centre is based partly on
serendipity and partly on the region's comparative advantages.
Mr William Boeing, the founder of the company that bears his name, was the
scion of a lumber industry family who first came to the Northwest, as a
drop-out from Yale University, because of its timber resources. It just so
happened that he had a passion for flying, and thus Boeing was born in 1916.
Boeing, with its civilian and military aircraft products, is one of
America's leading high technology companies in its own right, and it has
spawned a large number of other aerospace businesses in the Seattle area.
However, the location of Microsoft here owed much to the fact that Bill
Gates, its founder and chairman, happened to be brought up in the city. Paul
Brainerd, who founded Aldus, is also a Seattleite.
Serendipity apart, the high-technology industry has been aided by Seattle's
attractive location, which helps in wooing high-quality scientific staff,
and the area's strong academic credentials. These include the University of
Washington, with its important medical and engineering schools, and the Fred
Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, an acknowledged world leader.
Washington state's bio-technology workforce has been expanding particularly
fast - by 14.6 per cent last year to more than 4,200. The state is the joint
sixth in the US bio-tech league, alongside Los Angeles/Orange County but
still a long way behind the industry leaders, the San Francisco Bay area and
New York's tri-state area.
State officials have been trying to capitalise on this high-tech nucleus,
promoting the so-called 'technology corridor', a series of corporate
campuses stretching north of Seattle through Snohomish county and home to
more than 200 companies.
High-technology is also a crucial plank in the state's efforts to attract
foreign investment, which are also focused on the aerospace, environmental
engineeering, food processing and wood products industries.
It is putting substantially more effort into promoting the state in Europe
and has just set up its first full-time European trade office in Paris.
Half the foreign investment in Washington state is from Europe, with Britain
the largest single foreign investor in terms of dollars committed, followed
by Japan. Nintendo, the leading Japanese computer games company, has its
North American headquarters in Seattle.
Seattle repeatedly comes out at or near the top of surveys of the best
places to do business in the US - even though it offers virtually no special
financial incentives for companies to locate operations here.
Factors in its favour include a favourable tax structure, low electricity
prices, a well educated workforce (though recent reports have warned that
the state risks a shortage of high-technology personnel), reasonable
property costs and extremely attractive surroundings.
But Seattle's agonised wrestling between the imperatives of growth and the
preservation of its natural beauty is causing considerable difficulties for
the industrial community.
These were highlighted last autumn in a speech to the local chamber of
commerce by Mr Frank Shrontz, chairman of Boeing. He pointed out that the
company had benefited from the Northwest's 'pretty strong work ethic' yet
faced problems from the 'escalating cost' of building new facilities in the
Puget Sound area.
Boeing is building a new plant at Everett, north of Seattle, where it will
manufacture its new 777 wide-bodied aircraft, but the company is upset that
Dollars 50m had been added to the bill by fees to mitigate the effect on the
local community.
Mr Shrontz said Boeing believed that this, together with other cost
elements, meant it was 30 to 40 per cent cheaper to build in Wichita, Kansas
or Huntsville, Alabama - without even taking into account the financial
incentives offered in those centres or the fact that it now took about as
long to obtain permits and build in Puget Sound as it did to design and
build a new aircraft.
It was a warning shot to the local community and a reminder that Seattle
cannot afford to grow complacent and take either Boeing or its present
prosperity for granted.

FT  21 APR 92 / Survey of Seattle and Puget Sound (3): Consolidation is a
priority - There is little doubt the region is generously banked
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE dominant theme in the US banking industry for many months has been
consolidation. Mega-mergers between the likes of Chase Manhattan and
Chemical Bank, Security Pacific and Bank of America, coupled with the
relentless growth of 'super-regional' banks, such as Banc One and NCNB, have
commanded numerous newspaper headlines.
Yet nowhere can the 'micro' effects of this trend be more pronounced than in
Washington state, and in Seattle-Tacoma, the region's commercial centre, in
particular. The local commercial banking industry may have been spared some
of the most horrendous loan loss and ailing real estate problems which have
dogged its counterparts on the East Coast, but that has done nothing to halt
the marriage whirl.
There is little doubt that the region is generously banked. It has been
calculated that there are more than 100 commercial banks in Washington
state, not to mention an abundant supply of thrifts and credit unions. That
compares with, say, 60-odd commercial banks in Canada, and around 500 in the
whole of the UK.
Consolidation, in itself, is not new. Take Puget Sound Bancorp, which was
the last remaining major independent banking company in Washington until it
agreed last month to an Dollars 800m takeover by Keycorp, the New York
State-based banking group. Since mid-1989, Puget Sound has absorbed four
other local financial groups - Family Savings and Loan, First National Bank
of Enumclaw, Valley Bank and Puget Sound Securities - and, as of March, had
a further three deals pending. The total purchase price of the seven
transactions was put at around Dollars 50m.
Nevertheless, the pace at which mergers are taking place, and the size of
some of the deals, has certainly increased recently - a development
attributed to a variety of causes. Most local bankers prefer to stress their
desire to push down costs and increase efficiencies. One executive also
cites the need to improve competitiveness vis-a-vis large pension funds -
including the Washington State employees fund - which, he claims, are
stealing part of the banks' traditional customer base.
'Banks need to make more money, they need to get capital up,' says Luke
Helms, chairman of Seafirst, the Bank of America subsidiary which is already
the largest bank in the state and about to become bigger still via the
absorption of many local Security Pacific branches.
That said, the merits of these cost-saving claims, especially over long time
periods, remain debatable, and the issue of merger-related efficiencies has
been argued all the way to Capitol Hill.
What is indisputable, however, is that financial weakness and loan loss
problems - a second reason for the acceleration of the merger trend - are
having a significant effect on the Seattle region. For a start, while the
health of the local banks may be relatively good overall, financial
pressures have been cited as factors in the demise of Peoples National Bank
and Old National Bank, acquired by US Bank of Washington in the
late-Eighties, and of Seattle Trust and Savings, taken over by Keycorp.
Second, and more significantly, tie-ups between large, troubled out-of-state
banks have brought large local upheavals.
The merger between Bank of America, and the ailing Security Pacific - both
of which have headquarters in California - is the most striking case.
Locally, this brings together Seafirst and the Washington offices of SecPac,
which had acquired the sizeable Rainier Bancorp in the Eighties. These
previously constituted the number one and two groups in the area.
Not surprisingly, the impending deal has engendered all sorts of competitive
arguments at state level. After much furore, the upshot is an agreement
requiring that 86 of the SecPac branches be divested to third parties. This
leaves Seafirst to absorb around 82. Even with this reduced number, there is
some overlap with existing Seafirst offices. The net gain for Washington's
number one bank is likely to be more like 50, says Mr Helms. If so, Seafirst
would emerge from the deal with around 262 branches.
At the time of writing, the question of who would pick up the remaining 86
SecPac branches was still under negotiation. But whatever the outcome, it
seems certain to produce further ripples. In fact, this may already have
been a factor in the Keycorp-Puget Sound deal. Keycorp, which has been
building up a presence in the Northwest generally, was thought to be
extremely interested in the SecPac branches, but to have reckoned that it
would do better to pursue the purchase via the clout of Puget Sound. Hence
the relatively attractive offer for the Tacoma-based bank last month.
Meanwhile, West One, the Idaho-based bank, is understood to be another
contender for some of the SecPac branches, as is US Bank of Washington - in
turn, owned by US Bancorp of Portland and ranking number three in the state.
Few observers think the consolidation trend will end here. Both West One and
the Washington offices of the troubled First Interstate bank of Los Angeles,
in which New York's Kolhberg, Kravis Roberts, the leveraged buy-out
specialist, holds a near-10 per cent stake, are widely viewed as possible
takeover candidates somewhere down the road,
The question, however, remains. Who gains or loses from this burst of
marriage activity? Short-term, there are clearly job losses at stake -
executives involved in the Seafirst-SecPac deal estimate around 500 jobs,
for example. The real estate market, particularly in downtown Seattle, is
scarcely helped by the trend either, since financial institutions are
principal occupiers of abundant commercial space.
Leading corporate clients are probably unaffected, but more concerns
surround the small business community's access to capital. In truth, much
probably depends on the policies of the acquiring parent and the extent to
which lending decisions remain at local level. 'Consolidation can be bad if
the acquiring bank makes its policies too rigid,' concedes Don Vandenheuvel,
president and chief financial officer of Puget Sound. 'You need to retain
flexibility'.
On the upside, there are the bankers' promises of greater efficiency, and
more investment in electronic services. The average 'Seattle-ite',
meanwhile, can only wait until the dust settles before determining whether
services have really improved.
Finally, it is worth noting that this shake-out is a purely domestic affair.
Overseas banks - particularly from Japan and the Pacific Rim - have come and
gone in the past, and their presence today is very limited. The foreigners,
says one banker, were competitive pricewise, but at an inevitable
disadvantage in terms of customer recognition and speed of decision-making.

FT  21 APR 92 / Survey of Seattle and Puget Sound (2): A flying start for
prosperity - The long-term economic outlook is still reasonably bright
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE economy of Seattle and the Puget Sound has been the envy of many other
US cities for the past few years, as the region outpaced most of America
during the boom years of the 1980s and proved more resilient to the national
recession which set in last year.
The long-term outlook is still reasonably bright, but the city has no
grounds for complacency: the local economy has been soft for the past year,
with Washington state growth barely positive and employment stagnant, while
growth prospects over the next two years also look fragile.
'Many local businesses are noticing slower growth, and hiring plans are
quite modest,' notes Mr John Mitchell, chief economist at US Bank. 'If 1991
was a very slow year, 1992 may not be a whole lot better for many Washington
businesses, with employment expected to increase by only 2 per cent."
Fast growth, moreover, has brought with it problems: a surge in migration of
new residents to the area in the late 1980s from outside Washington has
pushed up inflation and housing prices, and has led to much greater traffic
and other environmental problems.
Seattle's economic buoyancy is a new phenomenon. Traditionally, the
Northwestern US, and Puget Sound in particular, have tended to suffer a
steeper decline in a recession than other parts of the US. This was
certainly the case in the 1981-82 downturn.
But the 1980s brought a spurt of investment in new industries in the region
 -notably high technology computer software, led by sector leader Microsoft,
and bio-technology - which local economists say have gone some way to
protect it from its traditional reliance on Boeing, the aircraft
manufacturer and largest local employer, as well as timber logging.
Another significant positive factor this time around has been the relative
buoyancy of the agricultural sector in the Washington hinterland.
All this said, local boosters are in danger of overstressing Seattle's
diversification. For the city owes much of its 1980s' prosperity to a rapid
expansion by Boeing, and it owes much of its present buoyancy to the size of
the company's order book: at around Dollars 90bn this represents well over
three years' of civilian aircraft sales.
Indeed, a study carried out for Boeing in 1989 by three independent regional
economists argued that, with 15 per cent of Washington state jobs linked to
the company, the economy was no less dependent on Boeing than it was 30
years before. While a lower percentage of the workforce worked directly for
the company, one Boeing job created 2.8 others in the region, compared to
1.8 in the 1970s.
Older, more guarded Seattle businessmen still recall the two 'Boeing Busts'
of recent decades - in the early 1970s,when the number of the company's
employees in Washington state plunged from 102,000 to just 41,000 three
years later, and a lesser contraction at the start of the 1980s.
Boeing's local employment is now more than 100,000 again, and its long-term
outlook seems good, given the expected growth in world aviation over the
next 20 years.
The next few years are more uncertain. Although Boeing is planning to trim
some 6,500 Washington jobs by the end of this year because of reduced
defence spending and slower demand for one type of civilian aircraft, the
company insists its overall order backlog is unaffected. It expects to
deliver a record number of commercial jets in 1992.
Yet some aerospace experts fear it could suffer a sharply reduced demand for
deliveries in 1993 and 1994. And if that happened, history might record that
Seattle did not so much escape the 1991 recession, but merely lagged it.
'The best we can hope for,' says Mr Robert Chase, research director at
Pacific Northwest Executive magazine, 'is that the aerospace sector will
remain resilient and stable.'
Certainly, the build-up at Boeing in the 1980s will not be repeated during
this decade. And this, coupled with other factors, suggests that Seattle's
growth during the 1990s will tend to mirror, or slightly outpace, that of
the nation, rather than exceed it dramatically.
'There is growing awareness,' says Mr Chase, 'that the boom years of the
late 1980s are over and the 1990s will be essentially different.'
Boeing apart, one of the main factors making for less frenetic growth in the
1990s will be a host of environmental initiatives. Many of these are local,
prompted by Northwestern concern over the impact of fast development in the
past decade, but others have assumed a national character, most notably the
battle between environmentalists and the timber industry over the fate of
the Northern Spotted Owl.
A complex tangle of court battles and government regulations has sharply
reduced logging in spotted owl habitats throughout the forests of the
Northwest over the past few years. Whatever the outcome of these
confrontations, it is already clear that they will mean a perpetual slowdown
in logging activity, and a loss of many jobs in the industry.
While the timber industry is located for the most part outside the greater
Seattle area, this reduction will nevertheless have a substantial knock-on
effect on the city, given its role as the region's main trading and shopping
centre.
And another conservation issue, which could have an even greater impact on
the regional economy, is looming just behind the spotted owl: efforts to
preserve salmon in the Columbia river system could mean a reduction in
hydro-electric power and a sharp increase in local electricity prices.
Yet Seattle has many other forces working in its favour. It has avoided the
boom-bust commercial property cycle which has hit the East Coast and
California so hard, and the slowing of the boom gives it the chance to
address the structural problems in the housing and transport markets which
have come with growth.
While its traditional industries may see relatively slow growth, or decline
during the 1990s, a wide range of service industries will provide new job
opportunities.
For Seattle's exhilarating physical surroundings, and its reputation as one
of the best places in America to do business, means that it is an attractive
place for mobile, knowledge-based businesses to put down roots.
'We are in the thoughtware business up here,' says Mr Bill Stafford,
executive director of the Trade Development Alliance of Seattle. Indeed,
Seattle's University of Washington boasts more US federal Government
research grants than any other American public university.
This, in turn, will attract new immigrants and increase the size of the
local consumer market. Washington is expected to have among the top five
population growth rates in the US through the 1990s.
Leading growth industries in the service sector will include computer
software, bio-technology, tourism, fashion design and environmental
services. (Seattle's clean-up of Lake Washington, formerly a local cesspool,
in the 1960s, was not only a local political landmark but also a spur to the
environmental business.)
International trade has been crucial to the Seattle economy since the days
when it was the main entrepot for the Yukon goldrush, and its importance
will increase over the next decade on the back of global economic
integration: the ports of Seattle and Tacoma and the region's Sea-Tac
airport are equidistant from London and Tokyo.
Closer to home, local politicians and businessmen are throwing considerable
energy behind the idea of a greater Northwestern regional economy. Dubbed
'Cascadia', this would incorporate the four Northwestern US states and
Alaska, together with the Canadian provinces of British Columbia and
Alberta.

FT  21 APR 92 / Survey of Seattle and Puget Sound (1): A delicate balancing
act - Phenomenal growth and the immigration of the past decade have created
substantial developmental problems for the region. Martin Dickson visits the
'most liveable city' and one of America's 'best places to do business', and
finds out how the community is tackling the issues

YOU CAN buy a set of grainy, black-and-white postcards, with the joke title
'12 reasons why not to move to Seattle' in the more progressive bookstores
of this beautiful, economically buoyant and civilised city.
The cards, which purport to show extremely unflattering pictures of the
area, are meant to be sent by Seattleites to friends or relatives in other
parts of the US who might be thinking of moving to the city. The aim is to
put them off joining the wave of humanity which has swept into the Puget
Sound region over the past few years as its economy has surged.
But the joke also makes a serious point: the growth and immigration of the
past decade have created substantial developmental problems for Seattle and
the surrounding four-county Puget Sound region, which together account for
half Washington state's economic output.
The danger is that unless the region takes control of the change, it could
end up losing the very quality which is attracting new immigrants and
business to the area - its extremely attractive lifestyle.
That said, the economic boom of the 1980s has now given way to a slower pace
of growth. Seattle has fared much better than the rest of the US in the
recession of 1991/2, and analysts suggest that its growth will still outpace
the national average during the 1990s - but only just.
In other words, the region is not so economically secure that it can afford
to take growth for granted. It remains highly dependent on Boeing, the
world's largest commercial aircraft manufacturer, and to a lesser extent on
the timber logging which first brought it prosperity in the 19th century.
Boeing, which has its headquarters just south of Seattle and is by far the
region's largest employer, seems set to enjoy strong long-term growth. Yet
there are doubts about its short-term business outlook, and local
businessmen still recall the dark recessionary days of the 'Boeing Bust' in
the early 1970s.
The timber industry, for its part, is contracting as environmentalists'
initiatives to save the Northern Spotted Owl restrict the supply of logs.
Other growth industries will offset these trends, notably the computer
software sector centred on Microsoft, which has its headquarters in a
Seattle suburb.
Important, too, will be the region's growing importance as a shipping and
airline entrepot mid-way between Europe and the Far East.
But finding a balance between encouraging growth and restraining it will be
far from easy. 'It's a very delicate act, but it has to be done because the
quality of life is partly what brings people here,' says Mr Paul Sommers,
research director at the University of Washington's Northwest Policy Center.
And the balancing act is causing no little friction: between slow-growth
environmentalists and fast-track industrialists; between property owners
threatened by development restrictions and planning authorities; between the
city of Seattle and its surrounding, middle-class suburbs; and not least
between old residents, so-called 'lesser Seattleites' who dislike the
changes in their city, and the newcomers, many of them refugees from
recession-hit, environmentally-troubled California.
But it is at least encouraging, amid all this heat, that the community is
tackling such issues head-on. Alarmed by the urban sprawl created in the
late 1980s, the Washington state legislature passed a growth management act
in 1990 which requires all cities and counties to draw up development plans
which define urban boundaries and create a coherent, consistent development
plan.
Mr Norm Rice, Seattle's popular black mayor, recently unveiled proposals for
the city designed to relieve pressure on the urban fringe, partly by winning
back middle-class people lost to the surrounding suburbs. He envisages a
series of 'urban villages' developed along the route of a proposed
mass-transit system.
'We can either take control of growth and channel it in ways which will
enhance our community, or we can sit on our hands and watch unmanaged growth
destroy all of the things we value about Seattle and the Puget Sound
region,' the mayor said.
'Seattle,' adds a regional planner, 'is still in the fortunate position of
being able to avoid the mistakes made by virtually every other major US
city.'
If there is a degree of smugness about that remark, it is understandable.
For more than a decade now Seattle has been picking up awards as the 'most
liveable' city in the US, one of the 'best places to do business,' to 'raise
children' and even America's 'top city for bicycling'.
This is in large measure because of the sheer beauty of its physical
surroundings. It is bounded on two sides by water - Puget Sound to the west
and Lake Washington to the east - and on three sides by mountains. In spite
of its rainy climate, it offers more accessible outdoor recreation than any
other US centre of comparable size.
Seattle itself is architecturally undistinguished, yet it has a very
attractive atmosphere. Its setting on steep hills next to water gives it a
character vaguely reminiscent of San Francisco.
Its downtown centre is simultaneously small enough to be manageable and
large enough to be reasonably sophisticated: it boasts an absurd number of
espresso coffee shops, some interesting Northwestern cuisine, excellent
bookshops and a plethora of art galleries, headed by the new,
architecturally bold Seattle Art Museum.
Somewhat improbably, it has also become the undisputed centre of pop music's
latest craze - grungerock. Rolling Stone magazine has just named the city
the 'new Liverpool'.
Nevertheless, Seattle remains neat, clean and unflashy, enjoying its
new-found wealth without flaunting it. 'This is a city of inconspicuous
consumption,' as one local writer puts it.
Prosperity has also changed Seattle's view of itself and America's view of
the city. Thirty years ago it was widely regarded as a dull provincial
backwater, physically isolated from the rest of the country and heavily
influenced by a dour Scandinavian heritage. Sir Thomas Beecham, the British
composer, called it a 'cultural dustbin'.
Today, it is seen as increasingly cosmopolitan, be it in terms of culture,
outlook or racial mix. In 1960, just 8 per cent of the city's population was
made up of minorities but the figure is now 25 per cent, thanks to strong
immigration during the 1980s by Asians, who now account for 11 per cent of
the population.
Throughout its history Seattle has looked to Asia for trade and cultural
ties and has developed unusually strong links with Japan - underlined
recently when a consortium led by Nintendo, the Japanese games company with
its US headquarters in Seattle, made a takeover bid for the city's baseball
team.
These links could prove increasingly important over the next decade as the
city aggressively markets its role as an East-West trading centre.
Yet Seattle is hardly Shangri-la. It has a high rate of violent crime, drugs
and Aids problems, homelessness (the term Skid Row originated here in the
19th Century), traffic congestion and concern over the quality of its air
and education.
However, many of these problems seem more manageable, or managed better,
than in many other US cities. For example, Seattle's initiatives for keeping
the homeless off the streets, involving a broad range of civic groups, have
been widely praised.
This sense of community is underlined in city politics, which involves a
high degree of policy input from strong neighbourhood interest groups.
Significantly, all city elections are by law non-partisan in nature,
although for the past two decades every mayor has been a member of the
Democratic party.
However, the mushrooming of suburbs in counties beyond the city limits means
that no amount of civic togetherness will allow Seattle alone to solve those
pressing questions which require regional solutions.
Among the most important of these are a host of inter-related transport
problems, including decisions on a new regional rail system and whether or
not to build a new run-way at Sea-Tac airport.
Seattle is hardly alone among American conurbations in grappling with
regional issues that transcend neat political boundaries. But because the
region remains relatively unspoilt, rather more hangs on it finding sensible
solutions.

WITH ONLY five full-time employees, the engineering division of GB Glass has
won an export award. Last year the division, based in Chesterfield,
Derbyshire, undertook only three major contracts, but these were worth a
total of Pounds 3.14m. The company is a specialist in the manufacture and
commissioning of large-scale glass manufacturing plants in the third world.
GB Glass is jointly owned by Siemens of Germany and Thorn-EMI. In addition
to Chesterfield, there are plants at Harworth, near Doncaster and Newcastle.
The company's biggest order has been for a Pounds 2.3m plant for China. In
the three years 1989-91 covered by the award, GB Glass Engineering won
export orders worth more than Pounds 8.26m.

FT  21 APR 92 / The Queen's Awards 1992 (22): It's hard to explain, but Z is
much clearer than English - IBM UK/Oxford University Computing Laboratory
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT MIGHT not be very easy to understand, but Z notation has quietly spread
its influence to computerised applications in in daily use by people across
the world.
In conjunction with a programming application called the Customer
Information Control System (CICS), it has saved costs, improved quality and
reliability - and been driven by an impressive collaboration between
academia and industry.
At least the assessors of the Queen's award for technology managed to wade
through sufficient technicalities in their decision to present a prize
jointly to IBM UK Laboratories and Oxford University Computing Laboratory
(the first time a university department has won a second award).
For most people, comprehension of CICS and Z notation rapidly fades away.
'It's always a problem trying to explain,' sighs Mr Tony King, a press
officer with IBM, wearily. 'It's something invisible, but used unknowingly
by millions every day.'
CICS, which Mr King calls 'one of the most successful pieces of hardware in
the world', is a family of software products used for managing business
information involving a large volume of transactions.
It is 'enabling' software which exists between the operating system that
drives computer hardware and any specific computer program designed for a
particular application.
It is designed to process great quantities of information with accuracy,
integrity and speed. It is an essential part of the driving force behind
cashpoint machines, and crops up in retail, insurance, airline and a wide
range of other applications.
CICS, which was developed by IBM, has been in use for a number of years,
with initial applications during the 1970s. The IBM Laboratories at Hursley
Park in Hampshire - which previously won a technology award in 1988 for
entirely different work - employ 1,500 people and have had worldwide
responsibility for CICS since 1975.
As demands for the use of CICS grew more sophisticated and complex - driven
by developments in both hardware and software - programmers faced
difficulties. Limitations in the techniques they were using to prepare the
code restricted their ability to take advantage of the latest developments.
The main problem was that the specifications for CICS - the requirements and
instructions used as the basis on which the program is written - were being
drawn up in the English language. With the latest versions of CICS running
to 800,000 lines of program code, English was fast proving itself not up to
the task.
'English is ambiguous, woolly and incomplete,' says Mr Paul Mundy, a
development programmer for CICS at IBM. 'When you use it to write a
description of what's going to happen, it is liable to different
interpretations and it may leave things out. It is often far too sketchy.'
At the same time, he stresses, any attempt to use a simpler, higher level
computer code instead of English is also fraught with problems. 'When you
write something in a pseudo-code, you have already taken some of the
decisions about how the software will work.'
The challenge was overcome after a chance meeting at a conference in 1981
between Mr Tony Kenny, CICS manager at IBM, and Professor Tony Hoare, of the
programming research group at the Oxford University computing laboratory.
An initial research contract has been expanded and developed ever since,
forging a collaboration that has now been in operation for more than a
decade.
The Oxford team were had been developing a theoretical,mathematically-based
language called Z notation, which is based on elementary set theory and
logic. With IBM, they had the chance to test it out with a major industrial
application.
By working together with IBM's software engineers, the Oxford academics
could examine CICS and gain a detailed understanding of its operations and
future requirements. They were able to modify and expand Z notation as a
result.
'With Z you are much more certain,' says Mr Mundy. 'You have an unambiguous,
understandable, complete description of what is going to happen. It is
abstract and doesn't force you to make any design decisions. Problems can be
found much earlier and more cheaply.'
Even so, Z still allows the use of English alongside more mathematical
concepts. 'It's not just a bunch of hieroglyphics,' he says.
The first product launched using Z notation to specify the CICS requirements
showed both a significant increase in quality and a reduction in development
costs.
Z itself has not had to evolve very far since the early days. But it has
been extended as CICS continues to be transformed over time. Work is now
under way to standardise Z, with a draft version being prepared for the
British Standards Institute.
'The work that has won the award is at the frontiers of software
development,' says Dr Geoff Robinson, director of the IBM Hursley
Laboratory. 'We are proud and grateful to have been associated with Oxford
University. I believe will continue to be a partnership of great mutual
benefit.'
Prof Hoare at Oxford adds: 'Our long-term partnership has contributed
simultaneously to commercial advantage, to the progress of pure science and
to the improvement of academic education.'

FT  21 APR 92 / The Queen's Awards 1992 (23): Breeders can benefit from Blup
statistical predictions - Cotswold Pig Development
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A sophisticated computer- dating system for pigs has won Cotswold Pig
Development an award for technological achievement.
The Lincolnshire-based company has developed a breeding scheme to speed up
genetic improvement in pigs and produce the consistently leaner, healthier
pork that international markets now demand.
It enables the performance, in terms of speed of growth and litter size, of
the same genes on different farms to be compared for the first time, in
effect separating hereditary and environmental influences. It uses a
statistical technique, best linear unbiased prediction (Blup), which makes
calculations based on detailed computer records kept on each pig's ancestry,
development and habits.
Once ideal mates to produce the next generation have been selected by the
computer, the Cotswold system loses its similarity with blind dating
agencies. Genes with desirable characteristics are brought together through
artificial insemination. This means that genes can be spread around the
country without having to move the animals, making the process much faster.
Dr John Webb, genetics director at Cotswold Pig Development, says that he is
carrying on a long tradition. 'Britain is pig breeder to the world. Britain
invented the science of breeding,' he said. Cotswold has updated what pig
breeders have been doing for centuries, and made the process far more
accurate.
Cotswold is the first livestock company to win a Queen's award for
technological achievement, but according to Dr Webb, the pig breeding
industry is a fertile ground for technological innovation. 'It is a small
industry, high-tech, very competitive, with a very short technology transfer
time. Because it is so competitive, it forces companies to get the
technology in as soon as possible,' he says.
The system which has won Cotswold the award was developed from technologies
which have been available for a long time. 'Really, we have taken two
technologies and married them. One was Blup, the other was artificial
insemination,' says Dr Webb. 'The world has been very slow with many
technologies. They sit on the back burner until somebody finds an
application for them.'
Blup itself was invented in the US 20 or more years ago and originally
applied to cattle breeding. As cows produce only one calf a year, the
calculations were much simpler. But pigs can have around two dozen offspring
a year. 'It was not on to use this for pigs until we had very cheap,
high-speed computing,' says Dr Webb.
High rates of artificial insemination, around 80 per cent, were also needed.
AI is not widespread in pig breeding - only 3 per cent of pig matings use
it. Cotswold has developed the technique and now runs the largest AI centre
for pigs in the world, using 360 boars a year.
Old-fashioned breeding methods are able to produce leaner and hardier pigs,
but find it difficult to increase litter size, as this is not a
well-inherited trait. Cotswold's techniques have changed this.
'What Blup does is give us a very accurate projection of a pig's genetic
merit for litter size. We can improve pigs born per litter by around one
extra pig every five years, which in biological terms is quite a lot,' said
Dr Webb.
The system also makes it easier to breed pigs with characteristics tailored
to specific markets. For example, conditions in south-east Asia are not
always as 'pig-friendly' as in the UK, so hardier specimens can be bred to
cope with the different environment.
Four years ago Cotswold Pig Development won a Queen's award for its
achievement in exporting pig breeding stock all over the world, from South
Korea and the Philippines to Italy and France. Around half the pigs bred by
Cotswold are for the export market.
Dr Webb kept pigs as a teenager. He has become so attached to them that he
prefers not to eat pork, but he describes that as a 'human frailty' and does
not let his own personal prejudice interfere with business. 'There is
nothing wrong with pig meat at all,' he says.

FT  21 APR 92 / The Queen's Awards 1992 (21): An engine for the future -
Rover Group
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ROVER GROUP'S K Series engine has now won its second major accolade since it
was unveiled 2 1/2 years ago as the unit destined to power a significant
part of Rover's car range for the 1990s.
The all-aluminium, powerful but very lightweight engine - inevitably dubbed
'Special K' by the enthusiastic motoring press - was also a recipient of the
UK Design Council's British Design Award early last year.
Already used in the Rover 200, 400 and Metro ranges, the K Series is
expected to expand into yet larger, more powerful - possibly even
supercharged - variants to power as-yet still secret new Rover models.
Currently the overhead camshaft engine is produced in three versions: a 1.1
litre giving 60 bhp at 6,000 rpm, a 1.4 litre producing 75 bhp at 5,800 rpm
and a 1.4 litre fuel-injected 16-valve high performance option developing 95
bhp at 6,250 rpm.
Developed over five years and the subject of a Pounds 30m development
programme, as well as Pounds 120m to produce it on highly automated but
flexible lines at Rover's Longbridge plant at Birmingham, the engine has
been praised for a whole string of attributes.
According to Rover, servicing costs over four years will prove to be less
than half those for less advanced engines of similar size and power.
The toothed rubber camshaft drive-belt is claimed to be good for 100,000
miles, twice the norm, and tappets are self-adjusting.
There is only half the usual volume of coolant, so the engine warms up much
faster on cold mornings.
However, what really captured the Queen's Award for Technology assessors'
imagination was the ease with which the engine can be assembled; in
construction terms it is the engineering equivalent of an American club
sandwich.
One of the problems with making an engine in aluminium is that, ordinarily,
a greater volume of material needs to be used to achieve the same strength
as cast iron, so that it is possible to wind up with an engine just as heavy
as an iron block unit, but a lot more expensive.
So, unlike conventional engines, the K Series is made as a four-layer
sandwich comprising, from top to bottom: cylinder head, cylinder block,
crankcase and main bearing supports.
All four are held together with ten, 16-inch steel through-bolts. In
practice, this means the engine is exceptionally strong as well as light and
easy to assemble.
Another advantage of the through-bolts is that they absorb all the major
stresses from the reciprocating parts of the engine, eliminating bore
distortion and enhancing engine efficiency and durability. The relative
simplicity of the concept also means lower bulk and weight.
The K Series stands as something of a tribute to Rover management's
determination not to give up its own engine design and development
capability during its long and difficult path to privatisation during the
1980s, and even though it is now in close partnership with Honda - one of
the world's best engine developers - with which it now has
cross-shareholdings.
Whether Rover will ever again embark on a 'ground up' engine programme,
however, remains an open question.
Judged by its predecessor, however, the K Series should have a life well
into the 21st century.
The K Series replaced, in the Metro, one of the most venerable engines - the
A Series - in motor industry history.
First designed in 1949, the 'A' powered the Austin A30 and Morris Minor in
the early 1950s. In 1959 Sir Alec Issigonis turned it through 90 degrees and
installed it in the Mini.
Thirty three years on, in much more powerful, fuel-injected form, it is
still powering the Rover's 'flying shoe-box', the Mini Cooper.

FT  21 APR 92 / The Queen's Awards 1992 (20): Credit for success goes to
workforce - Oakwood
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
FIVE YEARS after winning a Queen's award for export achievement, Oakwood
Design of Letchworth, Herts, has done it again. The company designs and
manufactures bank-card production machinery.
Oakwood claims to be at the forefront of the latest 'smart card'
developments which require micro-chips to be embedded in the cards, as well
as the card fraud-busting technique of embodying digitised photo images onto
bank cards.
Marketing efforts in the former eastern bloc are beginning to pay off, says
the company, with new markets established in the Commonwealth of Independent
States, Hungary and Czechoslovakia. Other potentially profitable regions
being targeted include Saudi Arabia, South Africa and Taiwan.
In 1987 the company exported just 58 per cent of its Pounds 1.6m turnover,
and this has grown to 86 per cent of last year's Pounds 5.4m sales total.
Mr Richard Smith, managing director, says it is greatly to the credit of his
70-strong workforce that Oakwood's products are in daily use in high-volume
card-producing nations such as the US, Canada and Western Europe.

FT  21 APR 92 / The Queen's Awards 1992 (19): Small oilfields made viable -
Amerada Hess
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EVER SINCE it was discovered in 1975, the Ivanhoe oilfield, in the North Sea
110 miles north-east of Aberdeen, had been deemed uneconomical to exploit.
Given the immense cost of constructing and installing equipment to produce
oil, the field was simply too small. Only when the neighbouring Rob Roy
field was located in 1984 did it begin to look feasible to exploit the two
together.
But in 1986 another blow struck. The oil price tumbled, and Amerada Hess
(AHL), the company with the rights to exploit the fields, was forced to
think again.
Undaunted, its designers managed to cut the cost of the project from Pounds
480m to Pounds 340m, with an innovative plan to refurbish an existing
floating platform to exploit the fields.
Six years later, with both fields now producing, AHL has won a Queen's Award
for technology for its floating oil and gas production facility - perhaps
the largest single project to win an award this year. This is the first time
in the world that gas had been exported from a floating platform, and that
two geographically separate fields have been exploited simultaneously from
such a facility.
Amerada Hess was one of the first oil companies to become involved in the
North Sea in 1964, when licensing of offshore fields began. It is now,
according to a recent survey by County NatWest, the UK's eighth largest oil
and gas producer in the UK, employing nearly 600 people in London, Aberdeen
and offshore.
In addition to the Ivanhoe, Rob Roy and Hamish fields, it operates the Angus
field, which came onstream at the end of last year, and the Scott field, one
of the largest in the North Sea, which comes onstream in 1993. It has
interests in a further nine oilfields and four gas fields.
AHL acquired an interest in Ivanhoe and Rob Roy when it purchased the oil
and gas interests of Monsanto Petroleum in December 1985. The company took
over operation of the consortium which owned the two fields - which also
includes Deminex UK Oil and Gas, Kerr McGee Oil and Pict Petroleum - and
undertook to develop the fields on behalf of the group.
The first step was to find a suitable semi-submersible platform for
re-fitting. The chosen vessel was the Sedco Phillips SS, formerly a flotel
used to carry out maintenance work on platforms in the North Sea, which was
renamed AH001.
If the name was slightly short of imagination, the project was not. AH001
was taken to Nigg Bay in Scotland, where redundant equipment including a
350-tonne revolving crane, and the existing generators and accommodation
modules were ripped from the deck. Two new 1,000-tonne cross-hull pontoons
were fitted to the structure to improve stability.
Then it was taken to Tyneside, where, at 12,500 tonnes, it was then the
largest structure ever to enter the Tyne. Eighteen months later, after a
further 2,500 tonnes of equipment had been removed and replaced with nearly
6,000 tonnes of structural reinforcements and oil and gas processing
equipment, it was certainly the largest to leave.
While the platform was being transformed from a floating hotel and repair
shop into a fully-operational oil and gas platform, drilling work was under
way 70 nautical miles out to sea, and 140m under water. By the time the
AH001 was towed out to sea in April 1989, it was ready to be linked by
flexible pipelines to three underwater manifolds connected by more pipelines
to the various oil and gas wells.
An export pipeline to carry oil the 25km to Occidental's Claymore A
platform, where it connects with a trunk pipeline to the Flotta Terminal in
the Orkneys, was already in place, as was a 14km gas line to Texaco's Tartan
platform, from where gas travels along a pipeline to the St Fergus terminal
on the east coast of Scotland.
Safety measures also have a high priority on the platform. Blast walls have
been fitted between the accommodation and the gas compressor train -
potentially the most dangerous area - which have been situated as far apart
on the deck as possible. Emergency shutdown valves, used to turn off the oil
and gas supplies in the event of an accident, are protected by special steel
platforms, and an enclosed lifeboat area fitted with an emergency incident
control room gives additional protection should the platform need to be
evacuated.
The project came onstream in July 1989, within budget and ahead of schedule.
Gas was first exported a month later, and in 1990 the small satellite field
Hamish was also hooked up to the AH001's facilities. Remarkably, only a year
passed between the discovery of this field and its coming on-stream - proof
of the versatility of AH001.
Mr Sam Laidlaw, AHL's managing director, says such floating platforms will
increasingly become a feature of North Sea oilfields.
'The average size of fields is clearly going to get smaller, and this type
of floating technology that can be re-used and shifted from field to field
is going to be essential to get the most out of the reserves left beneath
the North Sea.'

FT  21 APR 92 / The Queen's Awards 1992 (18): The prospect of fewer road
holes - Mercol Descaling
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GAPING holes in city streets for days on end while water mains are replaced
may be a less common sight in the future.
Crumbling and scaled-up water mains had become a curse of many British
cities, but Mercol, a Chesterfield company, has developed a possible
solution to the problem. It has developed an epoxy resin that can be used to
line the inside of pipes, and a quick and efficient way of applying it. The
invention has won the Queen's award for technology.
Mercol has been in existence since 1937, when its main activity was
manufacturing degreasants and descalers for heavy industry. It later moved
into refurbishing water mains, and developed a successful asphaltic bitumen
lining for mains in the 1960s - the first direct application method for
spray-applied linings.
By the late 1970s, however, it was clear that the days of the bitumen system
were numbered. Its quality was variable, and its lifespan insufficient, so
Mercol set about developing a new product.
It came up with Geopox GX014, an epoxy resin made up of two constituent
parts which harden when they are mixed - rather like some commercial
adhesives. Every aspect of the new material was tested and field trials were
conducted over nine years. The final 18 months were spent on toxicological
tests at the Department of the Environment's water research centre in
Swindon, to ensure that none of the chemicals in the resin would leach out
into water.
'This is probably the most durable lining you could have,' says Mr Noel
Miller, Mercol's chief executive, 'Tests have shown that it should be sound
for 100 years without any deterioration.'
Before the system could be fully approved, the DoE insisted that Mercol
should develop an independent monitoring system which could be fitted to the
machine applying the lining to ensure uniform quality and adherence to
quality standards throughout the application process.
In response, Mercol developed a positive displacement meter capable of
accuracies of better than 1 per cent in all conditions. These meters are
fitted to all lining rigs.
When a section of main needs lining, it is no longer necessary to dig up the
road. Besides the time saving, and the reduction in disruption to supplies,
the process is 75 per cent cheaper than relaying a water main.
Mercol has completed a number of contracts in Tyne and Wear, Kent and
Yorkshire. It already supplies six of the 20 contractors who carry out this
kind of work. Last year, its turnover was around Pounds 6m, although a
profit figure is not yet available.
The Mercol process is not suitable for every type of situation. Some mains
are simply too weak to be re-lined. But so far the company has been able to
use its process in 95 per cent of the cases referred to it.

FT  21 APR 92 / The Queen's Awards 1992 (17): Taste of triumph once again -
Glaxo
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GLAXO, the pharmaceuticals group and the UK's biggest company by market
capitalisation, has won its fifth award for technology with its antibiotic,
Zinnat.
Zinnat was developed because other drugs in its class needed to be injected
and were therefore of little use outside the hospital environment. In
addition, bacteria were building up resistance to existing antibiotics, such
as penicillin, which were proving increasingly less effective.
The challenge for Glaxo was to develop a drug that was:
pleasant to swallow. The active ingredient within Zinnat, Cefuroxime Axetil,
had an extremely unpleasant taste.
stable in water so that it retained its potency within the stomach and gut.
resistant to the enzymes in the gut but which could be ingested effectively
into the body.
quick acting once it had been taken into the blood-stream.
without any toxic by-products and therefore without serious side-effects.
able to resist Beta-lactamase, a substance excreted by bacteria which
prevents some antibiotics working effectively.
Glaxo believes it tested as many as 10,000 different formulations at its
Greenford research centre in north-west London over a period of about six
years before it discovered the right drug.
Its pharmacists also invented a new process to manufacture a wax coating
around the drug. The coating was not unpleasant to taste but dissolved when
required in the gut to release the active ingredients.
Since it was launched in 1987, more than 25m people have been treated with
the drug. Zinnat is used for a large number of infections, ranging from
upper respiratory infections such as tonsilitis and sinusitis, to urinary
tract infections and gonorrhoea.
Clinical trials showed that cure or improvement is achieved in more than 88
per cent of patients with lower respiratory infections and more than 90 per
cent of patients with gonorrhoea. Zinnat also has a low incidence of
side-effects.
More than Pounds 500m of sales have been generated by the drug since its
launch, which, according to Glaxo, makes its the second best-selling
antibiotic in its class.
Previous awards for technology were for Ventolin and Becotide, the asthma
drugs, Zantac, an ulcer treatment which is the world's best-selling
medicine, and Fortum, another antibiotic.
Glaxo has spent nearly Dollars 4bn on research and development over the last
10 years. In the last fiscal year alone, Glaxo spent Dollars 880m on
research and development and is expected by analysts to spend more than
Dollars 1bn - more than any other company. Its nearest rival is probably
Merck of the US.

FT  21 APR 92 / The Queen's Awards 1992 (15): The other side of a net
importer - Peugeot Talbot
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LAST YEAR, the UK's balance of trade deficit on motor vehicles shrank
sharply from more than Pounds 6bn to about Pounds 1.5bn. Much of the fall
was due to a UK new car market collapse, preventing the usual high volume of
imports from being sucked in.
Even so, Mr Geoffrey Whalen, UK motor industry veteran, past president of
the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, and Chevalier de la Legion
d'Honneur, could derive much satisfaction from the export contribution made
by Peugeot Talbot, the French vehicles group's UK subsidiary, of which he
has been chief executive for nearly a decade.
It is that contribution, notably the overseas shipment in recent years of
seven out of every 10 cars that Peugeot Talbot produces at its Ryton plant
near Coventry, which has led to its receipt of the Queen's Award for
exporting.
Along the way, and partly as a reflection of its colourful, varied and
sometimes troubled past, Peugeot Talbot has developed markets for its cars
and parts not just in France and other EC states, but in Australasia,
south-east Asia, Africa and Pakistan. New markets are being found in eastern
Europe, one of the world's main potential growth areas for vehicles - at
least in the long term - with Hungary and Czechoslovakia among the company's
Peugeot Talbot's early targets.
In unit terms, the company's export contribution last year amounted to
60,000 cars - all versions of the Peugeot 405, the medium-sized saloon which
is the only model currently produced by Peugeot Talbot's 6,000-strong UK
workforce.
To put that in context, total output at Ryton was 87,000 cars, so the
precise export content was just under 69 per cent. The previous year, before
the UK market began collapsing, Ryton built 116,000 cars, of which more than
81,000 went for export. These UK-built 405s went to a total of 20 countries,
although numerically by far the greatest proportion went to France and other
EC states.
Despite the award, in financial terms Peugeot Talbot almost certainly
remains a net importer. Its rapidly rising market share in the UK -
currently around 7 per cent - means that last year's UK sales of around
112,000 units were met by 17,000 UK-built 405s and more than 90,000 Peugeot
205, 309 and 605 models imported from Peugeot's continental plants. In
addition, many of the parts used to produce the Ryton-built cars are
imported from the Continent.
Given that in the early 1980s there were strong doubts as to whether Peugeot
Talbot had any kind of manufacturing future in the UK, however, the
company's achievements are not to be underestimated.
Born out of the French parent's takeover of Chrysler's deeply-troubled
European activities in the late 1970s, Peugeot Talbot inherited in the UK,
for example, the ill-fated Linwood plant in Scotland and lacklustre models
such as the Hillman Avenger, Sunbeam and Alpine - plus a valuable contract
supplying Peykans (essentially rebadged Hillman Hunters) to Iran in
quantities which at their peak hit 100,000 a year.
Linwood's closure, the Iranian revolution and shrinking UK sales had by 1983
created a pretty grim picture. The decision to withdraw all design and
development activities from the UK inevitably created fears that Peugeot
Talbot would become just a sales company for foreign-built Peugeots.
Peugeot agonised, looked at the industrial relations improvements being
nurtured by Mr Whalen in his initial role as personnel director - and
decided to invest Pounds 30m in re-equipping Ryton to produce a fully
competitive car, the Peugeot 309. By 1987, far from manufacturing
disappearing from Ryton, there was talk of putting on a night shift. Two
years later, with the larger 405 proving one of Europe's major success
stories, Ryton was dedicated to producing the 405 exclusively.
Next year, however, Peugeot Talbot's own balance of trade pendulum should be
swinging sharply towards the positive once more: Ryton is to become a
two-model plant again, building the replacement for the 309 as well as the
405. When, as expected, the good times return to the UK new car market
towards the mid-1990s, Peugeot Talbot is expected not only to have the
capacity to make 200,000 cars a year, but actually to be using it.

FT  21 APR 92 / The Queen's Awards 1992 (16): Shift from advertising to a
media strategy - Aegis Group
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARY MEAD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONE OF the more unusual awards this year is to Aegis Group, the holding
company for the world's largest group of media buying and planning
specialists. Aegis is quoted on the London, Paris and New York stock markets
but its more familiar wing for clients is Carat, the operating network and
brand name of the company.
Given that, on average, 85 per cent of the cost of any advertisement is the
space it occupies and the other 15 per cent is its production costs,
planning for the best and most cost-effective media space is of considerable
importance to both advertisers and advertising agencies.
First established in 1979, Aegis has managed to more than double its export
earnings over the past three years, at a time when advertising revenue
globally has come under considerable pressure. Overseas revenue now accounts
for 95 per cent of Aegis' income, mainly via overseas subsidiaries operating
under the name Carat. For the financial year 1991 Aegis reported turnover of
Pounds 2.109bn (exceeding the Pounds 2bn mark for the first time), and
pre-tax profits of Pounds 55.2m.
However, Aegis has not been entirely untouched by the general downturn in
advertising revenue - the pre-tax profits were 19 per cent below those of
the previous year, the first full-year decline since the company went public
eight years ago. That fall was partly attributable to a 1 per cent drop in
European advertising revenue, the worst performance for a decade.
Nevertheless, Aegis is organically growing. It now has more than 50 offices
in 18 countries, employing over 1,700 people. It has opened branches in
Prague, Budapest, Warsaw and Moscow.
Mr Roger Parry, development director, believes that Aegis's award is the
first to have been given to an advertising agency or media buying
specialist; it is an uncommon award for service companies generally.
Mr Peter Scott, chairman of Aegis and Carat's chief executive, says: 'For
the past three years the Aegis team have worked hard to build Carat as
Europe's leading media planning and buying network  .. Carat is now clearly
established as Europe's leader with billings in 1992 estimated at more than
Dollars 6bn, giving us a market share of 12 per cent. We like to think of
ourselves as a European rather than simply a British company, but we are
very honoured to receive the Queen's Export Award and pleased to have the
recognition of our success in creating a truly international company.'
Aegis started life as WCRS in 1979 as a conventional advertising agency,
re-christening itself Aegis in 1990 and gradually weaning itself away from
advertising and into media buying and planning. It suffered in the 1987
stock market crash - along with so many other advertising agencies - and its
acquisition-led growth slowed. The company was too small to compete with
international networks such as Saatchi and Saatchi or WPP and Mr Scott
decided to shed its advertising elements and concentrate solely on media
strategy; Aegis's advertising operations are due to be phased out by the end
of 1995.
The move away from 'pure' advertising and into media strategy has so far has
proved successful, though it initially attracted some shocked cries from
advertising agencies.
The European media buying market is at the moment moving towards
increasingly concentrated buying through the formation of 'clubs' - separate
advertising agencies forming tactical links to purchase large volumes of
media space and squeeze discounts from media owners. With such a network
already, Aegis is well-placed to compete with such clubs.
The future of the group is to some extent dependent on an easing of the
recession, though Aegis itself predicts only 2 per cent growth in
advertising revenue for 1992. One of the more promising areas is likely to
be Carat's sponsorship business, as advertisers turn increasingly towards
event sponsorships to make themselves more visible in a world of
increasingly fragmented media and expanding advertising clutter.

FT  21 APR 92 / The Queen's Awards 1992 (10): From cloth to an airborne
market - Baxter, Woodhouse and Taylor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BAXTER, Woodhouse and Taylor has come a long way since 1836, when it started
out as a cloth manufacturer in Manchester.
This year the firm has won a Queen's award for exporting super-lightweight
air ducting and insulation for the aircraft industry.
'As the marketplace changes, we have had to change with it,' says Mr George
Sampson, sales and marketing director at Baxter, Woodhouse and Taylor.
'Thirty years ago we got into the aircraft business. Because of our
expertise in manufacturing commodities in cloth, our product for the
aircraft industry is basically a fabric, glass fibre,' he says. The
company's main business is now producing a large range of lightweight ducts
for aircraft environmental control systems, which are engineered rather than
fabricated. The ducts can also be used in other vehicles.
The company's products can be found in 85 per cent of the western world's
aircraft, and 60 to 70 per cent of its business is carried out overseas,
largely in America, where the world's airline industry is centred. Customers
include such famous names as Boeing and McDonnell Douglas.
Mr Sampson attributes the company's success to quality and reliability. 'It
is a high-tech, big money but very fickle industry. If you make a promise,
but you break that promise, you are dead,' he says.
'We are almost obsessive in terms of getting out there and finding out what
the customer wants, and acting immediately,' says Mr Sampson. Although the
company is on the opposite side of the Atlantic to many of its customers, it
makes use of modern high-speed communications and transport to fill orders
overnight if necessary.
In the aircraft industry, relationships are important, and can sometimes
mean winning orders over lower-priced competitors. 'We have an intimate
relationship with all our customers. They know they can rely on us,' says Mr
Sampson.
The company brochure boasts that no task is too trivial, which also helps
win customer goodwill, he says. The company can respond fast to a small
order when an aircraft is being refitted. 'Environmental control systems are
always left to the very end, and half the time something is forgotten. Most
of our products are almost hand-made, and therefore flexible of labour. We
don't have to tool up, so we can turn round very quickly.'
The company's air ducts are up to 60 per cent lighter than comparable
products, giving them an advantage since extra weight means smaller profits
because fewer passengers can be carried. 'The product is not particularly
high-tech, but it services a high-tech area,' says Mr Sampson.
In spite of the recession, which has been particularly severe in the
aircraft industry, Baxter's sales rose 20 per cent last year. This is partly
because sales are not entirely dependent on the air frame manufacturers of
new aircraft. The company also supplies parts for the refurbishment of
second-hand aircraft, a sector which has expanded as spending on new
aircraft has dropped. 'People are spending money on used aircraft,
refurbishing them to a high standard,' says Mr Sampson.
The company is based at Adlington, near Macclesfield in Cheshire, and
employs 300 people, mostly women, at three sites. It is considering setting
up a factory in the southern states of America, near its main customers.
Direct flights between Manchester and Atlanta airport have made the prospect
more feasible.

FT  21 APR 92 / The Queen's Awards 1992 (11): Washdays made more
environmentally friendly - Warwick International
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FEW homes these days would be complete without a carton of concentrated or
environmentally-friendly washing powder.
The growth in the popularity of such products has been one of the clearest
signs of the increased public commitment towards conserving the environment,
and they are now the fastest-growing area in the European detergent
industry. Additives produced by a Welsh company, Warwick International, are
used in almost all of them.
Ariel Ultra, in the UK, and Dixan, in Europe, are the best-known brands
containing the company's products.
Warwick, awarded a Queen's Award for export for the second time in five
years, is one of only four companies worldwide (and the only one from the
UK) that produces the additives essential to make such powders effective.
Among these four, Warwick says it has the largest market share, although it
will not reveal the precise figure for competitive reasons.
For more than 12 years it has been developing a range of bio-degradable
additives based on the chemical Terta Acetyl Ethylene Diamine (TAED). These
have two main applications.
The first is to improve the efficiency of lower-temperature powders.
Chlorine-based bleaches have been replaced by 'greener' oxygen-based
bleaches in most powders, but the latter do not function well at lower
temperatures. Enter Warwick's bleach activators, which enable oxygen-based
bleaches to work even at lower temperatures.
Lower-temperature powders consume less energy during the wash, while their
concentrated forms save even more energy by requiring less packaging and
being more economical to transport.
The second main application for Warwick's additives is to boost the
effectiveness of phosphate-free powders. Many manufacturers have attempted
to eliminate phosphates as they contribute to the growth of algae in rivers
and in the sea.
'The growth of environmental awareness has been an important factor in our
success,' says Mr David Richards, the managing director.
'There has been a real resurgence in the past few years in the use of
concentrated detergents, due to both economic and environmental factors.'
Warwick International, based in Mostyn, Clwyd, also produces flame
retardants for fabrics, and softeners for textiles, but detergent additives
are the bulk of its business. The company's workforce has grown from 20 to
more than 300 in less than 12 years. More than Pounds 40m has been
reinvested in that period in new equipment and buildings.
The company's export policy, however, has also been crucial to growth.
Exports accounted last year for 82 per cent of sales, and Warwick has more
than doubled its already substantial export trade since it won its first
Queen's Award in 1988.
One reason for this is the company's policy of sending its scientists and
technical experts on frequent trips abroad to work with local companies to
produce the environmentally-friendly products best suited to a particular
market.
The company now has a multi-lingual sales team in the UK and places great
emphasis on the need for foreign language-speakers - backed up by a network
of 22 sales agents worldwide.
Of the 40 overseas countries Warwick exports to, western European markets,
particularly Germany, Italy, France, Spain and Benelux are by far the
largest. But Warwick is also making inroads into eastern Europe, where the
need for green detergents is evident.
It is also developing business in middle Eastern countries including
Algeria, Morocco, the Gulf states and Egypt, as well as in south-east Asia,
Australia and New Zealand. Its next target for expansion is Latin America.
Warwick has also contributed to the regeneration of the local economy, which
was devastated when the nearby Shotton steelworks closed in 1979, with the
loss of 8,000 jobs - the biggest ever plant closure in Britain. In 1984,
Warwick received loans worth nearly Pounds 6m from the European Coal and
Steel Community to aid the expansion of its chemical works and switch from
oil- to coal-fired equipment. The expansion helped to create more than 200
jobs, many of which went to former steel workers from Shotton.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
FOUR YEARS after it was established, Technic Group has won an award for its
success in exporting high quality re-tread tyres to EC countries and
Scandinavia.
The company exports 80 per cent of its output and its largest single EC
market is Germany. Its founders, Mr Phil Blood and Mr Tony Farmer, are the
joint managing directors.
The tyres are produced for passenger cars and light commercial vehicles
only. All are made to the same specification as those produced as original
equipment, ensuring that Technic products meet European regulations.
The company's turnover has grown from Pounds 1.8m to almost Pounds 13m,
while output has risen from 3,000 to 27,500 tyres a week. The company
employs 130 people and production is centred on a five-acre site near
Burton-on-Trent.
This year, production is set to increase by 30 per cent and 40 more
employees will be taken on.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
IT'S SECOND time lucky for GPT Payphone Systems. Last year, it won the
Queen's Award for Technology, and this year the company - 60 per cent owned
by GEC and 40 per cent by Siemens of Germany - received the award for its
exports. More than 70 per cent of the payphones produced at its factory in
Chorley, Lancashire, are destined for overseas markets.
These phones are sold to more than 50 countries, including Kuwait, China,
the US and Australia. In addition to the payphones - all sorts of coin,
smart and credit card phones - the company supplies the payphone cards. Use
of these has rocketed - GPT's output is nearing the 100m mark.
The company's cashless calling system, which won the award last year, allows
telephone calls from payphones without using coins. Standard credit and
banker's cards may be used and the billing is charged to the user's credit
card, banker's card or telephone account.

FT  21 APR 92 / The Queen's Awards 1992 (8): The pursuits of non-stop
brokers - SBJ Regis Low
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Brokers have traditionally generated much of their business in the US and
have traditionally been enthusiastic and successful exporters.
But with insurance rates depressed and the dollar weak, profitability has
been eroded of late. Success increasingly depends on the aggressive pursuit
of business.
And that, in a nutshell, appears to be the key to the recent profitability
of SBJ Regis Low, a Lloyd's insurance broking subsidiary of Steel Burrill
Jones, today awarded the Queen's Award for Export Achievement.
Regis Low's founders - Mr David Low, Mr Hugh Armytage and Mr Keith
Grant-Dalton, brokers - left Seascope, another London market broker in 1982,
to start up their new energy insurance broking venture from scratch.
The company's focused initially on oil rigs and other offshore
installations, later diversifying into hull and cargo risks, political risks
and construction insurance.
Its share of these specialised markets has grown rapidly, earning fee and
commission income of Pounds 11.7m in 1991.
Three-quarters of revenues are from business generated in the US,
Scandinavia, Europe, the Commonwealth of Independent States and south-east
Asia. Overseas earnings have doubled in the past three years.
Regis Low specialises in so-called 'wholesale' insurance broking, placing
insurance programmes on behalf of retail brokers who deal directly with
clients such as oil rig operators and shipping lines.
Margins are high. Some of Regis Low's competitors in the field such as Lloyd
Thompson - which has had a stock market listing since 1987 and Jenner Fenton
Slade - have achieved handsome rates of return.
Regis Low's profitability has been so impressive - the group earned over
Pounds 4.6m in 1991 - that Steel Burrill Jones, a listed medium-sized
broker, was persuaded to spend over Pounds 30m to acquire Regis last
December.
The price was viewed as excessive in some quarters but SBJ, which grew at
rapid pace in the 1980s, was anxious to diversify from its original
specialisation in marine reinsurance - an even more volatile and high risk
sector than energy insurance - and has made other acquisitions to reduce
that dependence.
In addition, Regis Low's business knitted in well with SBJ's reinsurance
interests: the broker can now more adequately provide insurers with a flow
of business and look after its reinsurance needs.
Moreover, Mr George Boden, managing director, says he was also impressed by
the high energy style of Regis Low's broking teams.
'They work from the early part of the day until late at night - hardly a day
goes by when they're not out with clients from North America in the evening.
It's just non-stop.'
Mr Boden adds that Regis Low's 130 staff 'love winning and hate losing.'
The company's brokers have a detailed knowledge of the London insurance
market - made up by the 280 syndicates at Lloyd's of London and
international companies - and place highly complex insurance programmes with
a number of syndicates and insurers.
'The broker has to understand the risk, describe it, find underwriters to
back it and then negotiate rates.' With Lloyd's underwriters in particular
wary about the risks they write after suffering heavy losses in recent
years, 'that can can be a sweaty business,' says Mr Boden.

FT  21 APR 92 / The Queen's Awards 1992 (9): How the human ear copes with
Wogan - British Broadcasting Corporation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE AWARD for developing the Nicam digital stereo sound system is the fifth
to be won by the British Broadcasting Corporation's engineers.
The Nicam system, already available to around three-quarters of the UK,
allows the transmission of two high quality digital sound signals within the
existing UHF television channel as well as the normal mono sound signal.
The two extra signals can be used to provide stereophonic sound or even a
dual-language service.
The technology reduces the amount of digital information that has to be
transmitted by sampling the stream of sound 1,000 times a second and cutting
out unneeded information or frequencies that the human ear cannot cope with.
The signal is conveyed on a new carrier using phase modulation and there is
no interference with either the picture or the mono sound.
The Nicam specification was accepted as the UK standard in 1986 and
recommended by the European Broadcasting Union as the European standard for
digital sound with television a year later.
The standard is in use in other parts of the world - Norway, Sweden,
Denmark, Finland, Spain, Belgium, New Zealand, Singapore and Hong Kong. But
Germany has produced a rival non-digital standard.
'This award demonstrates the BBC's continuing continuing commitment to
technical innovation,' Mr Marmaduke Hussey, chairman of the BBC, says.
The origin of the Nicam work goes back to the 1960s when BBC engineers at
the Kingswood Warren research centre were looking at how to deliver stereo
sound to the FM transmitter network.
The result is that compact disc quality sound is now available with
television and the public are starting to buy the necessary reception
equipment in growing numbers.
Last year more than 900,000 Nicam stereo television sets were bought in the
UK and around 550,000 Nicam video recorders.
All the signs are that before too long digital stereo sound will simply be
accepted as the normal sound standard for television programmes and
recordings.
Nicam was first developed to carry digital stereo sound for television in
1984 and was introduced experimentally on the BBC's transmitters at Crystal
Palace in south London in the summer of 1986. The full service began at the
end of August last year.
Wogan holds the record for the longest running BBC Television stereo
programme. It was first produced in stereo on August 11 1987.
The first Queen's Award to BBC Engineering came as long ago as 1969 for
creating a sophisticated system of standards conversion so that American
television programmes could be easily coverted for showing on the UK's PAL
television sets without loss of picture quality. In 1983 the BBC jointly won
an award with the Independent Broadcasting Authority for the development of
teletext.
The award comes as the BBC is looking at every aspect of its future role in
advance of the re-negotiation of its Royal Charter which runs out at the end
of 1996.
The task force on BBC technology identifies the impact of technical
innovation on broadcasting as one of the key factors of which the BBC will
have to take into account in the 1990s.
It recommends the creation of a new Advanced Engineering Centre and a
Technical Development Board, with strong programming representation to
organise the BBC's future policy in the area. And, perhaps, also to win
further Queen's Awards for Technological Achievement.

FT  21 APR 92 / The Queen's Awards 1992 (7): Sniping now looks like sour
grapes - Yamazaki Machinery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE WILL be mixed feelings in Europe's machine tool industry about the
export award for Yamazaki Machinery UK, the Worcester-based subsidiary of
Japan's Yamazaki Mazak.
For Yamazaki, the world's largest producer of computer numerically
controlled (CNC) machine tools, the award is an important accolade, and is
particularly welcome in the midst of a recession in the machine tool
industry.
Coming a year after Komatsu, the Japanese construction equipment group, won
an export award for its UK subsidiary near Newcastle, it indicates the
growing importance for the big Japanese mechanical engineering groups of a
pan-European approach to UK manufacturing.
'The company considers Europe is its market, not the UK plus exports,' says
Yamazaki.
However, Yamazaki's presence in the UK remains controversial, at least for
some machine tool rivals. The Worcester plant began manufacturing in 1987,
but has never really been accepted by the UK machine tool establishment.
And machine tool builders on both sides of the Channel still remember the
Pounds 5.2m of British government money received by Yamazaki in the
mid-1980s aid for the Worcester plant. The Pounds 5.2m was criticised,
erroneously, as launch aid, when in reality it was an 'FMS grant' available
to any company introducing flexible manufacturing systems into UK
manufacturing.
Winning the award might make some of the sniping look like sour grapes, and
makes a mockery of charges in the mid-1980s that machine tool jobs were
being created in the UK at the expense of hundreds more in Europe.
Yamazaki is now the biggest machine tool producer in the UK - and the
largest Japanese machine tool manufacturer in Europe. Its export achievement
is undeniable. From a standing start in 1987, exports have risen to around
85-90 per cent of turnover, which reached Pounds 63m in fiscal 1991.
Most of the exports are for the European market - the rationale for the
plant, after all, was to establish a manufacturing plant in the European
Community, well ahead of the Single Market. But some exports go to the US
and, especially in the plant's early days before the product range grew,
even to Japan.
In 1987, the plant began producing two models, but five years later the
product range has been expanded to 12 basic models of machining centres and
turning centres. Two new models, a vertical machining centre and the Super
Quick Turn range of machines, were introduced last year.
Employment at Yamazaki Machinery has risen to around 300 from 35 in 1986,
and has fallen only marginally in the current recession. This is an
achievement of which few UK machine tool builders could boast, and partly
reflects the inbuilt Japanese resistance to making redundancies.
The cuts were made mainly through natural wastage, although last month the
company did part company with Mr Stephen LeBeau, its sales director, in a
move that surprised industry observers.
But the relatively minimal job cuts are also due to a level of manufacturing
technology and organisation that allows the plant to operate at 50 per cent
of capacity and still be profitable.
Yamazaki, along with all machine tool builders, is suffering from the
recession, but stresses that production levels have not fallen that far.
Although the effects of Yamazaki's UK manufacturing are hard to quantify,
the company reckons that its presence probably directly gives employment to
about one-and-a-half times as many people as it employs itself.
It has also provided work for, and helped raised product quality at, a
number of UK and continental European component suppliers, in line with
local content agreements.
The head of one north Midlands foundry company recalls knocking on
Yamazaki's door many times in the mid-1980s in the hope of finding work. But
having won a contract to supply Worcester, he now also exports castings to
Yamazaki in the US, and has benefited from Yamazaki's collaborative approach
to boosting product quality at suppliers.
Yamazaki's presence at Worcester has also contributed to an emerging trend
of investment by Japanese components suppliers. Last year, Kitagawa, the
world's largest producer of power chucks for machine tools and a big
supplier to Yamazaki, joined forces with Mr Tertius Threipland, a British
entrepreneur, to begin manufacturing chucks at Salisbury, Wilts.
Exports at Yamazaki are likely to remain at their current level in
percentage terms, but the emphasis may switch from producing smaller
machines in high volume for the European market to larger machines in low
volumes for the world market.
The export award is the second recent accolade for Yamazaki Machinery. In
October it was selected by the Royal Swedish Academy of Engineering Sciences
to take part in a 'Best in the World' study of manufacturing productivity.

FT  21 APR 92 / The Queen's Awards 1992 (6): Isle of Man scores a first -
Clerical Medical International
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE AWARD for Clerical Medical International is a recognition not only for
the company, but also for the Isle of Man, where it is based.
No company on the island has won an award before, even though its financial
services industry is almost wholly export-led. This may have been due to the
dubious reputation it had built up, mainly thanks to the collapse of the
Savings and Investment Bank in 1982.
Regulation has been much tightened since then, and the Isle of Man now has a
deposit protection scheme in place. It was also the first offshore
jurisdiction to win designated status under the UK's Financial Services Act
of 1988, which in effect recognised the island as offering the same degree
of investor protection as on the mainland.
The island's new clean-cut image has led to an influx of financial services
companies.
CMI, a subsidiary of Clerical Medical Investment, the Bristol-based life
assurance group, was established in March 1987, and has perhaps been the
most successful of the island's financial groups. It now has about 300
staff, including 170 based on the island, and sold a total of Pounds 149.5m
in new product business in 1991.
This accounted for 18 per cent of Clerical Medical's new premium income last
year, down slightly from 20 per cent the year before. CMI's total funds
under management are now around Pounds 450m.
Dr Bill Hastings, chief executive of the island's insurance regulatory
authority, is delighted by the news: 'What better accolade could our sector
have? This is a real first: a first for the island and a first for any life
insurance company. It is a winning day for the Isle of Man, and an event for
which the whole island may be proud.'
It is not surprising that life insurers have failed to win exports awards in
the past, as differing national tax regimes form a barrier against marketing
pensions or endowment savings plans in the same way in different countries.
Linguistic barriers are also a problem, given the personal contact from
salesmen which is usually necessary before consumers can be persuaded to buy
life insurance.
But these arguments do not apply to offshore life companies such as CMI.
Their tax position on the island is such that they would lose several
privileges if their products were available to Manx consumers.
Traditionally, the prime market for such companies has come from UK
expatriates - people working abroad who want a favourably-taxed resting
place for their savings. However, CMI and several other life groups have
broadened their sights in recent years to aim for 'international investors'.
For residents of any country, life funds held on the Isle of Man can roll up
gross of tax. Neither income nor capital gains tax is payable. For UK
citizens, tax will be only payable once these funds are brought back into
the UK by someone who has worked abroad - the tax-free roll-up ensures that
the tax bill will have been lessened.
This advantage also applies to foreigners working in the UK - 'inpats' in
the jargon. And several countries, such as Sweden, have tax regimes which
allow their citizens to shelter money offshore, even going to work abroad.
The recent decisions by both Hafnia of Denmark and Skandia of Sweden to set
up life operations on the island show the potential of this market.
CMI has been one of the most adroit in capturing the new market of 'high net
worth investors'. It now has representatives in more than 60 locations in
Europe, Asia and the US.
Although UK expatriates still make up the bulk of the business, about 25 per
cent comes from south-east Asia - a slightly smaller proportion than for
some Manx life companies, such as Royal International - while about 10 per
cent comes from Africa, and 10 per cent from South America, with around 4
per cent from Sweden, and 5 per cent from central Europe.
The company's product range has also helped it to attract more sophisticated
investors. Apart from the usual straightforward single premium life 'bonds',
and pension contracts, CMI has taken advantage of the opportunities Isle of
Man regulators have allowed for innovative fund management without a life
assurance element.
Thus there is a choice from straightforward deposit administration accounts
denominated in US dollars or Deutschmarks, through to 24 individual equity
funds investing in specific countries. CMI also offers umbrella funds, and
investments which 'track' the FT-All Share, S&amp;P 500 and Nikkei 225 indices.
There is also a range of trusts.
More product launches are planned for the near future. But for the time
being, the satisfaction of Mr Mike Richardson, CMI's chief executive, seems
justified: 'Today's announcement is a tribute to the hard work and
dedication of CMI's staff and to the support we have received since we
established operations on the Isle of Man.'

FT  21 APR 92 / The Queen's Awards 1992 (5): Europe welcomes mellow sound -
Kemble &amp; Co
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
KEMBLE &amp; Company is no stranger to exporting. For the first two years after
the second world war it was forbidden by the UK government from doing
anything else.
At the time, the UK was desperately short of foreign currency, and keen to
establish export markets for UK companies by stealing a march on mainland
European countries whose industries were all but destroyed during the war.
Mr Brian Kemble, now joint managing director of the old family business,
remembers his father, who had recently returned from the war, travelling
across Europe by car to sell his pianos. On his first few trips, he still
wore his army uniform.
Times may have changed, and Kemble is now a joint venture with the mighty
Japanese Yamaha Corporation, but the export culture remains strong. The
company has gained a Queen's Award for more than doubling its export sales
over three years to Pounds 5m in 1991.
The Kemble family began manufacturing pianos in a small workshop in Stoke
Newington, north-east London, in 1911. Then it was a small fish in a pool of
more than 200 UK manufacturers. At their peak in the 1920s British companies
produced more than 60,000 pianos a year.
The industry has declined ever since, hit by a falling market and almost
dealt a knock-out blow in the 1970s by an over-valued pound and strong
competition from cheap imports from south-east Asia. But Kemble, once the
minnow, has overtaken the bigger fishes, and absorbed some of its
competitors, including such names as Chappell of Bond Street. It is now by
far the largest UK producer, with 93 per cent of all UK piano exports.
More than 6,300 pianos a year roll off the production lines of its
purpose-built plant in Milton Keynes, where it moved in 1969.
One year before that, Mr Denzil Jacobs, joint managing director, made the
first contact with Yamaha, which had started to manufacture electric organs
in competition with Hammond. Soon, the Yamaha-Kemble subsidiary formed as a
result was the UK's main importer and wholesaler for the whole range of
Yamaha organs and pianos.
That relationship persisted until 1984, when Kemble signed an initial
agreement to start manufacturing Yamaha pianos under licence in the UK. The
first models were produced in 1986. Two years later, Yamaha, looking for a
European partner to be able to take full advantage of the single European
market, established a full joint venture with Kemble.
Yamaha in turn invested in the Milton Keynes plant, introducing state-of-the
art machinery and computer-controlled production. The factory was expanded
and re-equipped and its capacity increased from 4,000 to 10,000 units a
year. The development was unusual, given Japanese companies' preference for
greenfield sites.
Mr Brian Kemble ascribes the success of the partnership to the combination
of the traditional high quality standards and craftsmanship of Kemble, and
the technological know-how of the Japanese.
Yamaha is now the biggest shareholder in the joint venture - although the
exact size of its holding is undisclosed - but Mr Kemble says the company's
family ethos has not been lost. If anything, it has been enhanced by the
partnership.
'The first thing I did when I became managing director was to abolish the
director's dining room and toilets. I didn't need the Japanese to tell me to
do that,' Mr Kemble says.
'We have learnt a lot from Yamaha, but we have looked in many different
areas for the best practices. And Yamaha has learnt from us. In Japan, its
staff are no longer obliged to wear uniforms, which was the result of our
influence.'
Creating a successful partnership with quality products and a
state-of-the-art plant was only part of the battle. The UK piano market
continues to decline - last year only 10,000 models were sold - and so
Kemble was forced to turn its attentions increasingly to export, which by
last year absorbed three-quarters of the company's products.
The link with Yamaha has undoubtedly proved advantageous. Around 75 per cent
of Kemble's pianos are exported under the Yamaha name, and sold to Yamaha
subsidiaries in France and Germany which market them in Europe. Kemble
produces all the non-black upright Yamahas for the entire European market.
'The design is Japanese, but we use different components such as German
sounding boards which have a more mellow sound popular in Europe,' Mr Kemble
says.
The remaining 25 per cent of pianos are exported under the name of Kemble or
Chappell of Bond Street, and are sold through sales agents abroad, direct to
retail stores. Over the past three years, Mr Kemble has had a policy of
selecting 'young, dynamic agents' especially in Holland and Germany - which
seems to have paid dividends.
The largest export market remains western Germany, a fact of which Kemble is
particularly proud given the strength of the indigenous competition -
companies such as Steinway and Bechstein, as well as Bluthner of east
Germany.
The second-biggest market is France, followed by Italy, Spain, Switzerland,
Holland, and a number of other European countries.
Kemble is also having some success in taking on the local competition in
south-east Asia, including Hong Kong and Singapore. Here, the company feels
the Queen's Award will be a particular advantage.
'There are companies in the Far East manufacturing pianos with British names
that are of poor quality. The Queen's award will further enhance our
reputation over there. Now, if people see the logo, they will know they are
getting the real thing.'

FT  21 APR 92 / The Queen's Awards 1992 (3): A traditional image appeals to
Anglophiles - Barbour/Fortnum's/Gloverall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRODUCTS reflecting the traditional British image and way of life are
selling well all over the world, but particularly in Japan.
You can't get more traditionally British than the royal family, and one
reliable sign of a long-established British product is the presence on the
label of the crest which indicates a royal warrant of appointment, awarded
to products favoured by the royal family.
J Barbour and Sons, best known for waxed jackets which cope with the worst
of British weather, is one company that will be adding the Queen's award for
export logo to the three royal warrants of appointment it already displays.
Its garments are sported by several members of the royal family, and its
brochure even advertises a Mark Phillips jacket for riders.
Barbour has found that Britain does not have a monopoly on the need for
bad-weather clothing, judging by the boom in sales across Europe, America
and Japan.
The company started towards the end of the last century making oilskins for
the North Sea fishing fleets. Now its 'Thornproof' waxed cotton jackets have
become a widely-imitated classic of country style. During the 1980s the
range expanded to include every kind of outerwear, from hats to socks and
all-in-one wading outfits. Most items are intended to be worn for hunting,
fishing and riding but in fact are often seen on the streets of London and
other cities.
Barbour garments are exported from the company's base in South Shields and
sold to 25 markets across the world, through wholly owned sales subsidiaries
in the main markets and a network of distributors and agents.
Fortnum and Mason is the biggest name in luxury foods in the UK, and because
of its royal warrant of appointment to the Queen it is often referred to as
the Queen's grocer.
Although Fortnum and Mason in Piccadilly, London, is its only store,
Fortnum's food products are stocked by many other department stores and
specialist food shops in the UK.
In 1981 the company set up a separate export division to cope with the
growing international demand for tea, biscuits and preserves carrying the
Fortnum name.
'The company's products have been enjoyed outside England for more than two
centuries, but in the last five years controlled expansion of sales by the
export division has achieved worldwide recognition for our range of quality
food products,' Fortnum and Mason says. Export earnings represent a
significant and increasing proportion of total turnover.
In Japan, Fortnum's has become known as a specialist tea house, and its
attractively packaged own-brand varieties of tea have high prestige value as
gifts. They are sold from concessions in many department stores including
Mitsukoshi, the 'Harrods of the East'.
Japan is also an important market for duffel coats made by Gloverall of
London, which also wins an export award. The duffel, a practical, warm
hooded coat, originated in Belgium, but was British military issue in World
War II, and became popular with students in the 1950s after Gloverall was
approached by the Ministry of Defence to sell off the military's surplus
coats.
Forty years later the duffel is still Gloverall's main product, and is
available in countless variations of style and colour. Gloverall describes
the duffel as 'the epitome of British style', but says its appeal is now
totally international. Gloverall has a 1.5 per cent share of UK clothing
exports to both Japan and France.
'Despite the current economic climate we are constantly setting new export
sales records,' said Mr Roger Morris, the chairman.

FT  21 APR 92 / The Queen's Awards 1992 (4): All the world's a test paper -
University of Cambridge Local Examinations Syndicate
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
PERHAPS THE fact that the University of Cambridge is a name recognised all
over the world has contributed to the success of its Local Examinations
Syndicate in translating local into global presence.
The syndicate was established in Cambridge in 1858, and now conducts
educational assessments on every continent and in almost every country.
Business has expanded threefold since 1985, and more than 60 per cent of
turnover comes from outside the UK, an achievement that has won the
organisation an export award.
Dr Tyrell Smith, deputy secretary of the syndicate, hopes the award will
help to correct the image many people have of the UCLES. 'People in the UK
just think of us as an O-level and A-level board. But we do have a very big
export side to our work,' he says. The syndicate went international as far
back as 1863, when it examined candidates in Trinidad.
Now its business is divided into three, roughly equal, sectors: UK work,
overseas schools examinations and English as a foreign language (EFL)
testing.
Last year 1m candidates sat Cambridge exams and 8m question papers were
completed.
The syndicate is run as a department of the university, and its board of
governors is composed of Cambridge dons. It employs 450 people in Cambridge,
as well as thousands of part-time examiners and full-time representatives in
several countries.
In the field of EFL, the main competition is with American English and
examining bodies such as Princeton's Education Testing Service, but Dr Smith
says many schools prefer Cambridge tests for their more rigorous methods.
'One distinct reason why people tend to choose us as opposed to ETS tests is
that we have a more holistic approach. We are interested in the way people
write the language and speak it. Our requirement to write continuous prose
has been an important difference,' he says. American tests rely heavily on
multiple choice testing.
Interest in learning the English language tends to coincide with countries
opening up and becoming more internationally minded. Demand for EFL has
surged in eastern Europe in the past couple of years. The syndicate's
business in Greece has boomed since it joined the EC, and it is now
developing markets in south-east Asia.
One growth area which has surprised even the examination syndicate has been
the success of the International General Certificate of School Education,
introduced in 1988 and equivalent to the GCSE, which has replaced O-levels
in Britain. Entries for the IGCSE rose to 38,000 in 1992, up 50 per cent on
last year.
The UCLES says the IGCSE is 'not simply an expatriate version' of the GCSE,
but is based on an international curriculum, 'free from Anglocentric or even
Eurocentric bias'. This is borne out by its popularity in such diverse
places as Egypt and Latin America. In 1995 Cambridge's IGCSE will replace
the South African system currently used as a national secondary school
leaving exam in Namibia.
The 'localisation' process, whereby Cambridge exams are adopted nationally,
is an important part of the syndicate's work. 'With Commonwealth countries
becoming independent, they have tended to want to develop their own
examinations,' says Dr Smith. In Zimbabwe the syndicate has worked closely
with the education ministry to set up an O-level exam system which meets
local requirements. The exams are now taken by 200,000 students a year, and
are marked by 4,000 local examiners, trained by UCLES.
Other countries, including Singapore and Namibia, prefer to stick to
Cambridge's IGCSE, making it easy for students to work or study anywhere in
the world.
The syndicate also trains and examines EFL teachers. Many teachers of
English abroad are fresh graduates with no specialist teaching
qualifications, but the need for at least basic training in EFL is
increasingly being recognised. The syndicate runs EFL teaching courses of
varying lengths tailored to different needs. Last year 7,000 candidates were
tested at 300 centres worldwide.
So successful has UCLES been that, in some parts of the world, when you
mention the name of Cambridge, people now think first of the examination
syndicate, and only after that of the university.

FT  21 APR 92 / The Queen's Awards 1992 (2): Rich pickings are found abroad
 -There are a record number of export winners and more applications than for
many years
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY

<TEXT>
BRITAIN may be in the depths of a recession, but some companies at least are
finding that this need not harm their growth.
If the numbers of applicants for and winners of the Queen's Awards for
export are anything to go by, more British companies than ever are finding
there are rich pickings to be had in the export market, even if demand is
disappointing back home.
A record 127 export awards have been given, one more than the previous
highest total in 1990 and, after a slightly disappointing response in the
last few years, 1,181 applications were received this year - the most since
1979.
To qualify for an award, according to the rules, an applicant has to
demonstrate a 'substantial and sustained increase in export earnings to a
level which is outstanding for the products or services concerned and for
the size of (its) operations'.
Generally, the increase has to have been sustained over a three-year period,
so it is noteworthy that 15 of this year's winners have been established
within the last five years.
However, many of the award-winners have a history dating back to the last
century, including such well-known names as J Barbour &amp; Sons, the garment
manufacturers; Fortnum &amp; Mason, the fine food purveyors; and the security
company Chubb.
Twenty-three awards went to companies that have won export awards before.
For Tiphook, a London-based company which supplies containers, road trailers
and rail wagons to the shipping, distribution and transportation industries,
it was the fourth export award in eight years.
Other multiple winners include Huntleigh, which previously won in 1982 and
1987. This Luton healthcare company exports to 50 countries including Japan,
India and Russia - an impressive achievement in the medical field where
regulations can be rigid and vary across different borders.
Euromoney, the magazine publishing, advertising and conference company, also
wins the award for the third time. Three-quarters of its total income now
comes from 144 countries all over the world.
There is other evidence of companies continuing to build on their success. A
number of previous recipients of technology awards have turned their
technological prowess into export success.
For example, British Gas, whose 'intelligent pig' - a sophisticated
inspection vehicle which passes through pipelines under the force of the gas
or liquid in the pipe - gained a technology and export award in 1988, has
won a second export award for more than trebling overseas earnings from its
pipeline inspection services.
Another repeat winner, Portsmouth-based City Technology, which manufactures
gas sensors for a range of applications in the safety, energy-saving and
emission control areas, has won two previous technology awards in 1982 and
1985, as well as an export award in 1988.
GPT Payphone Systems of Liverpool, which makes intelligent payphones,
phonecards and cashless calling systems, won a technology award last year
and has gained an export award this year for exporting to more than 60
telephone administrations in 48 countries.
No Queen's Awards list would be complete without a representative from ICI,
and this year ICI Katalco of Cleveland is a repeat winner. The company,
which supplies the Puraspec range of purification processes to remove
impurities from gases and hydrocarbon liquids, picked up a technology award
last year and has followed it up with an export award.
A final multiple winner is Oxford Magnet Technology, based in Witney,
Oxfordshire. The company, now jointly-owned by Oxford Instruments Group and
Siemens, develops and manufactures whole-body superconducting magnet systems
for magnetic resonance imaging scanners.  It won awards for technology and
export in 1985 and a further technology award last year.
While several of the UK's largest companies - including British Steel,
British Gas, British Aerospace, Rolls-Royce, ICI and Thorn - are represented
in the list, there is a refreshing variety. Exports range from MBA degrees
and natural history documentaries to ships in bottles and bicycle mudguards.
Among the export winners, 68 per cent employ fewer than 200 people, while
five companies have fewer than 15 employees.
The smallest company on the list is Associated Timber Services with a staff
of nine. Established six months before the hurricane which sent trees
crashing down across the southern Britain in October 1987, this
Suffolk-based firm of timber merchants now exports timber and other wood
products all over Europe. Export sales have increased more than fivefold in
the last three years.
Invisibles performed particularly well to take 16 per cent of the awards.
The insurance sector, which received its first award only two years ago,
this year had three representatives: Clerical Medical International
Insurance of the Isle of Man - a subsidiary of Clerical, Medical and General
Life Assurance and the first ever Manx winner; Newman Martin and Buchan,
brokers specialising in the energy industry and marine market; and SBJ Regis
Low, a Lloyd's broker specialising in oil rigs and hulls.
The management consultancy sector is represented by Godel Escher Bach,
established in 1987 and specialising in strategic planning techniques for
senior executives in multinational companies. Its Executive Information
Systems software has been described as 'user promiscuous' and was designed
for 'the most computer illiterate board director'. The company's exports to
Europe, south-east Asia and the US have more than trebled in the past three
years.
More Fisher Brown, a small partnership established as recently as 1988,
becomes only the second firm of solicitors to win an export award. With
clients in 58 countries, it deals exclusively in legal services to the
international marine and insurance industry. Another first is achieved by R.
G. C. Jenkins, as the first patent and trademark agents to pick up an award.
The academic world is also well-represented. The London Business School is
recognised for more than doubling its fee income in the last three years
from overseas students and managers on its MBA and non-degree courses.
UMIST, the University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology also
receives the bulk of its foreign earnings from overseas students' fees, but
also from research services and technology transfer overseas carried out
through its subsidiary, UMIST Ventures.
The University of Cambridge's Local Examinations Syndicate is rewarded for
its success in marketing its English as a foreign language examinations
worldwide.
One company involved in training is International Aerospace, which trains
military and civilian pilots and flight engineers, and now receives more
than 80 per cent of its income from overseas.
Other sectors which are strongly represented are aerospace; the garment
industry; printing; high technology; foodstuffs; and computers and software.
The importance of overseas investment in the UK is again evident, and the
proportion of companies with overseas parents seems to have increased
slightly this year. Seven are owned by US companies; four by Japanese; two
German; with one Canadian, one Australian and one French. The best-known of
these are car manufacturers Nissan and Peugeot Talbot, while Kemble, the
leading piano manufacturer, is now a joint venture with the Yamaha
Corporation.
Companies come from the length and breadth of the UK, with 11 from Scotland,
four from Wales and three from Northern Ireland, and, for the first time,
one from the Isle of Man. All have defied the recession, and once the
recovery is under way, should be in a strong position to make the most of
growing domestic demand.

FT  21 APR 92 / The Queen's Awards 1992 (1): It's more than just better
mousetraps - Technology's profile is set to rise in Mr Major's new
government. The new Faraday institutes are designed to build bridges between
industry and scientists. But the link between technology policy and exports
remains industrial productivity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANNY GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE NEW government of Mr John Major is preparing to raise the profile of
technology. The minister responsible is Mr Tim Sainsbury, a minister of
state. His predecessor, Lord Reay, was only a junior industry minister.
Within a day of his appointment last week, Mr Sainsbury said he would 'bring
together the department's responsibilities for industrial sponsorship and
industrial support services'.
It may sound like a simple shift in responsibilities, but the word
'sponsorship' has reappeared in the vocabulary of the Department of Trade
and Industry statements after an absence of several years.
This should hearten Sir John Fairclough, the former chief scientific adviser
to the Cabinet Office under Mrs Margaret Thatcher and now chairman of the
Engineering Council, the umbrella body for 46 professional institutions.
Last year, the Prince of Wales asked Sir John to set up and chair a working
group on innovation to propose improvements to the links between academic
and commercial research. The interim report from the working group in
January was warmly welcomed by government ministers and the Conservative
election manifesto echoed its proposal to establish centres of technological
excellence.
The new bodies, to be called Faraday institutes, are based on Germany's
Fraunhofer institutes. The function of both is to build bridges between
industry, which sometimes fails to see academia as a source of fruitful new
ideas, and scientists, who fail to exploit fully their ideas in the private
sector. They are a route for both people and ideas to move from the public
to the private sector.
An infrastructure for Faraday institutes is already in place. Existing
independent research and development companies, which pay their way by doing
contract work for industry, could be given a higher public profile. They
would then take on some public funding and be encouraged to employ staff
studying for higher degrees.
If taken up, this proposal would be a far cry from the last time a UK
government tried directly to promote technology in industry. The
interventionist Labour government of the late 1970s feared that Britain
would miss out on a semiconductor industry boom and set up a company, Inmos,
in 1978. The subsequent Conservative administration sold Inmos to Thorn EMI,
which sold it on to its current owner, SGS-Thomson of France. Last month,
SGS said it would end UK production of the transputer microchip and transfer
it to France.
The UK still has no large domestically-owned producers of microchips. DTI
staff talk of the Inmos initiative with evident pain and embarrassment.
The attraction of Faraday institutes is that they avoid Inmos-like direct
intervention while clearly putting in more of an effort. Mr Sainsbury talked
last week of 'working in partnership with industry', a notion perhaps more
in tune with Majorism than Thatch- erism. The institutes also fit in with an
idea expressed by ministers in recent years of the state as enabler,
creating the environment for industry to work better.
This approach is also seen in the Prince's Working Group's second idea: the
creation of 'Cities of Innovation'. This would be a trans- ferable label
like the European City of Culture, run by the European Commission. Cities of
Innovation would be used to encourage univer- sities, polytechnics, local
government and industry to develop plans for making the best of local
technical expertise.
In spite of their visibility, Faraday institutes and Cities of Innovation
run the risk of being seen in the mould of the Queen's Awards: cheap but
high profile, an aid to marketing rather than investment.
The awards are indeed used mostly in marketing by companies. They have done
little help the morale of British researchers either, damaged by falling
investment. UK gross domestic expenditure on research and development fell
between 1981 and 1988, while it rose in France, Germany, Italy, Japan and
the US. Many engineers and scientists saw the low cost approach of the 1980s
reason enough to declare their allegiance to parties other than the Tories
last month. Letters to newspapers from British researchers at home and
abroad castigated the 'progressive erosion in public support for research'
since 1979 and the resulting lack of morale in the scientific community.
Can Faraday institutes help? They would not be a 'complete model', concedes
Mr Peter Lilley, the trade and industry secretary in the last government.
Morale might be an area to benefit as academic scientists and engineers gain
a clearer career structure into the commercial world.
But career prospects are not what technology is for, as treasury minsters
might remind Mr Sainsbury. His department will be spending Pounds 350m on
research and development annually and will watch British industry invest
billions more.
Perhaps this megaspend is designed to make better new products. If so, this
is not reflected in the pattern of Queen's Awards winners. Some awards are
indeed for better mousetraps such as Marconi's satellite dish. But many more
are to improve manufacturing. Better mousetraps may make the world beat a
path to your door, but the secret of winning the Queen's Award is to raise
the productivity of mousetrap manufacture.
This is the right priority according to Mr Bob Whelan, the chief executive
of the Centre for the Exploitation of Science and Technology (Cest), an
independent organisation funded by 19 British companies and working with
government and higher education. 'The issue of industrial produc- tivity
stands at the heart of technology policy,' he says.
Furthermore, the vitality of technological innovation is directly connected
to strong exports, he says. A product reliant on domestic buyers will have
its sales eaten away by imports.
Productivity may be the link between technology and exports, but again, this
is not reflected in today's Queen's Awards winners. There are no joint
technology/export awards. Although there is a record number of export
awards, the number of technology awards is only typical for the last few
years.
There are good reasons for this. In a time of deep domestic recession, it is
not surprising that companies should redouble their efforts to sell into
more buoyant markets overseas. It is also understandable for companies to
take a long, hard look at their research and development budgets and cut
some of the more borderline or speculative projects. This has been reflected
in a fall since 1990 in the UK's gross domestic expenditure on research and
development.
Cash pressures also affect government priorities. There may be demands to
put more research and development cash into areas where few productivity
gains will be seen but cash will be saved.
High on the list is the entry of technology into health care at home. Both
the government and private health insurers want patients to stay for as
short a time as possible in expensive overnight hospital beds. This can be
done by making use of electronic devices, such as health monitoring devices
worn by patients at home which automatically dial for help in an emergency,
and by better drugs. One of this year's award winners is ICI's Diprivan, a
general anaesthetic from which patients recover more quickly.
Technology is also being called upon to solve environmental problems. While
high on the political and legislative agenda, this does little for
industrial produc- tivity. As such, it does not fit in with the existing
award schemes and the establishment of a Queen's Award for environmental
achieve- ment from next year recognises this.
So it will be difficult for Mr Sainsbury to keep his eye on the productivity
ball. One measure of his effectiveness will be whether exports of
manufactures stay strong when the British economy returns to growth, thus
making the domestic buyers a softer touch. It might take more than Queen's
Awards and Faraday institutes to win that fight.

FT  21 APR 92 / The FT Interview: Challenges facing heir apparent - Wolfgang
Schauble, second-in-command to the German chancellor, talks to Quentin Peel
and Andrew Gowers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By QUENTIN PEEL and ANDREW GOWERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The contrast could scarcely be greater. Mr Helmut Kohl, the German
chancellor, is a great bear of a man with a palpable physical presence as he
bursts into a political meeting. He is also a master of the art of
ambiguity, of calculated blundering and mumbling, all part of the eternal
German search for consensus, the essence of his coalition government.
Mr Wolfgang Schauble, his closest political confidant and all-but-anointed
heir, is a slight figure, precise in both word and movement. He is like a
self-effacing second in the corner of a heavyweight boxing champion.
The assassination attempt which left him paralysed and wheelchair-bound 18
months ago has, if anything, accentuated the contrast. Where the chancellor
strides on to a platform, his second-in-command must laboriously wheel
himself to the podium. Where the chancellor towers over his audience, Mr
Schauble must peer past the microphone with a self-deprecating grin.
Yet both men share the same acute political instinct, a love of intrigue and
infighting, an instinct for the political jugular, and a considerable
respect for and loyalty to each other.
Mr Kohl is the unity chancellor, the man who spotted the brief moment when
it was possible to bring the two halves of Germany back together. Mr
Schauble negotiated the unification treaty, screwing the nuts and bolts into
place.
Mr Schauble also represents the new generation in the German leadership, the
first to reach the top who cannot remember the Second World War. If he does
succeed to the party leadership and the chancellorship for which he is so
obviously being groomed, his task will be to cope with the post-unification
trauma, and the challenge of Germany's search for its international
identity.
He is in little doubt of the political, psychological and physical challenge
he faces. 'We have quite enough political problems to deal with during this
unification period,' he says. 'Those who have to take government
responsibility at a time of such huge changes do not have it very easy. You
can see that from the opinion polls.'
Yet he was as shocked as any by the recent state election results in
Schleswig-Holstein and his own home state of Baden-Wurttemberg, showing a
sharp increase in support for the parties of the extreme right-wing.
'The election result is a bitter defeat for the big democratic parties,' he
comments. 'These were protest votes, not against a particular party, but
rather against those in power in general.
'The cause is a general insecurity of all citizens about whether those
responsible, in central government and the states, are capable of dealing
with the problems the people are facing. We must take this vote very
seriously.'
Just one week before, commenting on the rise of the far right in the
elections in France, Mr Schauble had warned: 'Nobody is entirely immune from
such a development.' Yet he is firmly convinced that Germany can and will
deal with the economic and social problems arising from unification, and the
search for a national role.
Like the chancellor, he refuses to be downcast by the cost of subsidies for
the collapsed economy of the east. 'It is difficult, but not too difficult,'
he says. 'We have to deal with a very strained budget. The capital markets
are also rather stretched, but they are capable of handling it.'
He understands the prevailing gloom in the business community, but refuses
to share it. The private sector is worried at the scale of the task in east
Germany, on top of the country's commitments to eastern Europe and the
former Soviet Union. What is left of east German industry is facing a
disastrous collapse in exports to the rest of eastern Europe, when it is
still not capable of competing for new markets in the west, he agrees. And
on top of that, the outlook for the world economy is bleak, and there is a
real danger of failure in the Gatt trade liberalisation talks.
'All these things together have their effect on the entrepreneurial class,
which has got used to 10 years of uninterrupted growth. They see a slight
weakening (in the German economy) as a dramatic development. One must take
this gloomy mood seriously, but if you look for the real causes you can be a
bit more relaxed.'
One clear hope he has is that the completion of the single market in the
European Community will bring a new boost to economic growth. But he admits
there is a growing mood of questioning over Europe in Germany.
He pinpoints three causes: the lack of political union to counterbalance
economic and monetary union will lead to financial instability; the
additional financial burdens of the EC are excessive, on top of the cost of
unification and eastern Europe; and the security reason for western European
integration (protection in the east-west conflict) has vanished with the end
of the Cold War.
Of the latter cause for doubt, he says: 'I don't think that is right.
Precisely because of the end of the east-west confrontation, given the
proliferation of unpredictable developments not only in eastern Europe but
in the Mediterranean area, we need integration in western Europe all the
more.'
He is worried that Germany's partners do not see that need - and the need to
involve Germany - so clearly. 'I think our western friends should think very
hard about how the federal republic, sitting in the middle of Europe, can be
ever more firmly anchored in western Europe, and not tempted backwards and
forwards between east and west.' Such a scenario, he says, cannot be in the
interests of Germany's western friends.
'We are always the one confronted most immediately with developments in
eastern Europe. Our neighbours must resist the temptation to use the federal
republic as a sort of cordon sanitaire to protect themselves against the
developments in eastern Europe. That would not be a good development for
Europe.'
He fears that there might be a temptation in western Europe to acknowledge
the big problems in the east and the threat of migration, but look at it
simply as a problem for the Germans. 'That would be very shortsighted,' he
says.
As for economic and monetary union in the EC, he is convinced that it is
right and that the criteria agreed at Maastricht are adequate. But if at the
end of the decade 'the Europeans don't want it, there will be no court of
appeal where one can lodge a complaint and say the law must be fulfilled'.
He is less passionate on this score than Mr Kohl, although 'it would be a
mistake' not to take the opportunity.
The one real spark of passion comes with the suggestion that Germany might
be using its new-found unity and sovereignty to dominate its European
partners. 'Who says that?' he snaps, but then relaxes. 'We Germans must
understand that such rapid changes as we have seen in Europe will also be
critically debated by our friends. I don't think we have too much cause to
feel sensitive.'
He does believe that, so far, the German government has dealt calmly and
correctly with its new role. It has abandoned any claim to eastern
territories, or any questioning of its frontiers. It celebrated the
'fantastic events' of unification in a controlled way. 'We celebrated unity
with violins, not with trumpets,' he says. 'That was no bad thing. We have
had enough brass bands in our history, and that was not to our advantage,
nor that of Europe.'
There is a single-minded, ambitious aggressive streak in Mr Schauble which
his opponents perceive. There is a softening, a deepening in his character
which others are convinced has come from his close encounter with death and
his subsequent paralysis. He is himself very conscious of the physical
challenge ahead. 'I am not sure how it will look in five years' time,' he
says. 'I am watching myself closely.'
In the meantime, he shows remarkable self-confidence, and appears to revel
in the daily political challenge. 'My colleagues are content, I am content
and the opposition is content. That is no bad thing.' A politician to the
bitter end.

FT  21 APR 92 / Justinian: Judicial rebuke in the Strand
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUIS BLOM-COOPER QC
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lord Lane, the Lord Chief Justice, last week bowed out of office after 12
gruelling years. He had presided over the English criminal justice system at
a time of deepening worries about its efficacy and social value.
The valedictory speeches at the Royal Courts of Justice in the Strand
resounded to the accompaniment of praise from Lord Lane's colleagues and
plaudits from the legal profession, against a background of sustained media
criticism of the controversial Lord Chancellor following a series of
miscarriages of criminal justice.
Two notes of dissonance disturbed the ceremony. First, Lord Donaldson, the
Master of the Rolls, spoke out against the press for having exceeded the
bounds of responsible criticism and for making the Lord Chief Justice the
scapegoat for recent miscarriages of justice; second, Mr Gareth Williams QC,
chairman of the Bar Council, hinted darkly that all is not well in
relationships between the Strand and Whitehall. The two criticisms are
intertwined.
No judge - none more so than Lord Donaldson - denies the vital role which
the press plays in criticising legal decisions. Only the media constantly
parades judicial conduct under the public searchlight. Parliament applies a
self-denying ordinance which bars MPs from criticising judges except upon a
substantive motion, a rare enough event which focuses on a single instance
of judicial conduct. It takes a piece of serious misconduct to induce MPs to
table a motion criticising a judge, let alone an address for his removal
from office.
Since the press is, in effect, the only mechanism of discipline which
operates constantly and in the open, it bears a portion of responsibility
for keeping a check on the courts and the judges. The press also has a
peculiar duty to supply the information upon which other mechanisms can
operate to discipline a misbehaving judge or to remedy defects in the
administration of justice. If it is a truism that a free press must
necessarily be an irresponsible press it is less true when the press reports
on the workings of the legal system. Here responsibility must be more
strictly adhered to.
Lord Donaldson's outspoken attack on press hounding of the Lord Chief
Justice was therefore by way of a judicial rebuke in lieu of a warning that
the press may actually have been committing a contempt of court. The law
states that public criticism constitutes a contempt only if there is an
unfair imputation of corruption or conscious bias in a court or judge acting
in an official capacity, or if a criticism is not made in good faith or
exceeds the bounds of reasonable courtesy and hence amounts to scurrilous
abuse. This class of contempt of court is distinguishable from contempt in
the face of the court and from prejudicial coverage of pending trials. It is
known as 'scandalising the court'.
The difficulty with proceedings against a newspaper for 'scandalising the
court' is that the court before whom the alleged contemner was brought would
be judge and jury in its own cause; at the same time, the attorney-general
would almost certainly be prompted to prosecute the newspaper. These days a
move to commit a newspaper editor for contempt would be howled down as an
oppressive instrument of the judiciary and in violation of a right to
freedom of expression.
What then can, or should, be done to curb the excesses of press criticism?
The Press Council, until its demise 18 months ago, never adjudicated upon a
complaint of contempt by a newspaper. If it had received a complaint it
would have referred the matter to the attorney-general.
The Press Complaints Commission, successor to the Press Council, does not
canvass complaints other than those received from the aggrieved citizen; in
any event its code of practice makes no provision to protect judges in
respect of newspaper contempt.
Lord Donaldson's outburst, and the predictable riposte from the newspapers,
discloses the seemingly sole avenue of redress left for unwarranted press
attacks on the judiciary.
It has been the contention over many years that the Lord Chancellor will
come to the defence of the judiciary when it is unreasonably criticised. In
1972 Lord Hailsham in his first term as Lord Chancellor warned that 'there
was some danger that popular pressures might endanger the administration of
justice'. At the time Lord Bridge of Harwich (then Mr Justice Bridge who had
tried the case of the Birmingham Six) and Judge Christmas Humphreys were
criticised in the media. Lord Elwyn Jones and his predecessor Lord Hailsham
spoke up publicly in the judges' defence.
There's the rub. Lord Donaldson's exceptional disavowal of the traditional
Trappist approach of judicial silence in the face of public criticism was
prompted entirely by the apparent lack of support from Whitehall. The judges
are sensitive to, indeed incensed by, the lack of support from Lord Mackay,
the Lord Chancellor. One senses that had Lord Mackay not been engaged in
Cabinet business last week, and had appeared in the Strand, Lord Lane would
have declined to receive his warm wishes for a long and happy retirement.

FT  21 APR 92 / Post-modern test for government: America
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If we want to continue to be number one, we need to transcend the legacy of
modernism - modern thought and modern institutions, including bureaucracy.
You know how different American society is today compared to 1960 or even
1970. We're different; we're post-modern. Yet the government has not kept
up. People sense it intuitively: modern government is trying to run a
post-modern society, and it is failing.'
I quote from a speech by Mr James Pinkerton, a policy adviser at the White
House. Mr Pinkerton, a conservative, is in the vanguard of a cross-party
movement urging a wholesale reform of the US public sector. The closest
thing to a bible for the movement is a new book, Reinventing Government, by
David Osborne and Ted Gaebler (Addison Wesley, Dollars 22.95). Prominent
figures praising the book include Governor Bill Clinton, the leading
Democratic presidential contender, who has described it as a 'blueprint' for
the revitalisation of government.
The first powerful critique of modern bureaucracy dates from the 1960s when
US economists James Buchanan and Gordon Tullock invented a doctrine known as
'public choice'. This highlighted an apparent inconsistency in market
economics. Traditional theory assumes that individuals seek to maximise
their personal well-being: consumers maximise utility or satisfaction while
businessmen maximise profits. Strangely, however, economists assumed that
when individuals became bureaucrats, they would work for the broader public
interest.
Public choice says this is a naive assumption. Bureaucrats are as
self-serving as anybody else. They are typically interested in retaining
their jobs, gaining promotion and expanding their sphere of influence. In
tightly run organisations, they will mainly seek to please their immediate
superiors. But often, if they cannot be fired, they will please themselves.
The last thing we should assume is that civil servants are motivated only by
the goals of their distant political masters.
Such arguments helped justify the Reagan-Thatcher assault on big government.
The post-modernist critique of government is less harsh. Rather than
directly impugning the motives of civil servants, it claims they are trapped
in organisational structures that no longer function.
What is meant by post-modern? Mr Pinkerton offers a few colourful examples.
'Network TV is modern - you watch what they put on. Cable is post-modern -
you have a choice. The postal service is modern. Faxing and E-mailing are
post-modern. Plastic surgery is modern. Staying out of the sun is
post-modern.' Modernism, which dates from the late 19th century, is thus
associated with mass production, uniformity, and predictability;
post-modernism with flexibility, choice and personal responsibility.
'Our thesis is simple,' write Osborne and Gaebler: 'the kind of governments
that developed during the industrial era, with their sluggish, centralised
bureaucracies, their preoccupation with rules and regulations, and their
hierarchical chains of command, no longer work very well.' They regard
modern bureaucracies as a hangover from the days of Henry Ford, who
pioneered assembly-lines and other techniques of mass production. In
industry, post-modernists' battle cry is 'flexible specialisation': small
companies with highly qualified, adaptable workforces are seen as more
likely to cope with competitive threats and rapid technological change than
Fordist dinosaurs.
But what would post-modernist policies mean for the public sector? Osborne
and Gaebler try to dissolve apprehension by stressing their deep faith in
government and their admiration for individual bureaucrats. They set out 10
principles for reform which are too tedious to repeat. Most have a familiar
ring for those who lived through the Thatcher years: for example, treat
people as customers, encourage competition between service providers,
decentralise decisions and focus on outcomes rather than inputs. Their view
that government 'should steer not row' is still radical in a US context:
remember that the UK education and health care reforms of the 1980s were a
bigger challenge to the status quo than anything attempted in America.
In the US the litmus test will be education. The high school system - set up
at the turn of the century to prepare students for big business - is
quintessentially modern (as opposed to post-modern). In most areas, children
are allocated to large schools run on rigid, bureaucratic principles by
school boards. Post-modernists favour the introduction of a voucher system
giving parents freedom to choose schools and headteachers much greater
autonomy. If the high schools are eventually overhauled along such lines,
the US will have rejected the existing public sector paradigm.
There is a kernel of truth in the public choice and post-modernist
critiques, which share a distrust of current arrangements. But the former is
too cynical - there is such a thing as a public service ethic - while the
latter probably exaggerates the pace at which society is changing. In the
long-run, however, as more people get wealthier, the demand for customised
products and services will grow, forcing a less monolithic approach in the
bits of the public sector that survive.

FT  21 APR 92 / World Stock Markets: Universe grows as investment black
holes close - Sweden and Switzerland plan to liberalise the ownership of
shares by foreigners
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Europe's universe of equity investment is expanding, with the planned
removal of restrictions on foreign ownership of shares in Sweden and
Switzerland.
The process is likely to be a jerky one, but in time the corporate sectors
of two countries that add up to the equivalent of the world's ninth-biggest
economy will be much more accessible to foreign capital.
From July 1, Switzerland will implement a new business code that will
prevent companies from refusing to register shares on the grounds that their
owners are foreign.
In Sweden, rules in companies' articles of association that limit foreigners
to 40 per cent of a company's capital or 20 per cent of its voting rights
are due to vanish by the start of next year.
In both countries, there are obstacles to this liberalisation of share
ownership. Swiss companies will still be free to impose limits on the size
of stake that any shareholder can build - some are as low as 2 per cent.
Swedish companies are asking the government to delay its proposed deadline
for the abolition of foreign ownership restrictions by one year, to January
1, 1994.
Nevertheless, over time the impact of the reforms will be significant. A
study by SG Warburg Securities, the London-based broker, of 13 big Swedish
companies - accounting for roughly half of the country's total market
capitalisation - suggests that only 40 per cent of their shares are
theoretically accessible to foreigners. The figure is closer to 32 per cent
in practice, since some of the ostensibly free shares are unlikely to move
out of Swedish hands. If these big companies are any guide, the
internationally available portion of Sweden's stock market capitalisation
will treble once the reforms are complete.
In Switzerland, the portion of the market closed off to foreigners is more
limited. At the end of the 1980s, for example, registered shares constituted
only a quarter of total market capitalisation.
Even if all registered shares had been closed to foreigners at that point -
and some had already opened up - making them accessible would raise the
portion of the Swiss stock market attainable by international buyers by no
more than one third.
There may be unpleasant surprises on the way. International portfolio
managers have not forgotten, for example, that when Nestle decided to allow
foreigners to buy its registered shares in 1988, the Swiss index of all such
shares rose 9 per cent overnight, while that of bearer stock and
participation certificates dropped by more than 4 per cent.
In Sweden, a typical company has two classes of shares: A shares usually
have 10 times the voting power of B shares. Each category is subdivided into
'free' and 'restricted' shares, depending on whether they are open to
foreigners or not.
In the 13 Swedish companies studied by Warburg, A shares represent 57 per
cent of total capitalisation, but contain 91 per cent of the voting power.
In some companies the difference is even more marked: Electrolux's A shares
account for only 3 per cent of total share capital but hold 97 per cent of
the votes.
Once the free/restricted distinction disappears, the difference between A
and B shares may become more marked, say the Warburg analysts, particularly
in those companies where there is a significant float of A shares. Investors
will need to watch out, says Warburg: 'There are instances where the removal
of foreign ownership restrictions could actually lead to a deterioration
rather than an improvement in the relative attractions of low-voting B
shares.'
In Switzerland, the Nestle experience has led to an erosion of the premiums
once enjoyed by bearer shares. Indeed, says Mr Hans Kaufmann of Bank Julius
Bar in Zurich, there has really been only one sector where these premiums
have still applied in recent years: insurance.
The assumption had been, until very recently, that insurance companies would
not be covered by the opening of share registers, because they were affected
by restrictions on foreign ownership of Swiss property assets.
Mr Kaufmann believes this assumption is unfounded. The property restriction
is under review by the government, he says, and in time insurers will open
their share registers.
Earlier this month, Schweizerische Lebensversicherung und Rentenanstalt, of
Zurich, was the first insurer to remove all restrictions on ownership of its
equity. Since then, Swiss insurers' registered shares have risen relative to
bearers and participation certificates, as investors anticipate an
opening-up.
The changes will ripple through the Swiss financial system over the next few
years. The banks - in their role as stockbrokers - have already dropped
their 30-year-old ban on handling foreigners' purchases of registered
shares. The big banks themselves, however, remain immune from the changes:
the equity of a bank with 'Swiss' in its name must stay in local hands.

FT  21 APR 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Late program buy order
leaves Nikkei above 17,000
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ARBITRAGE unwinding amid quiet trading depressed share prices, and the
Nikkei average briefly slipped below 17,000 in the last few minutes of
trading before moving back above that level on a program buy order, writes
Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The 225-issue average lost 509.33 or 2.9 per cent to 17,071.36. The index
opened at the day's high of 17,548.07 and reached the session's low of
16,935.67 just before the close.
Volume fell to 200m shares from 300m. Foreign investors were absent due to
the holidays, while domestic investors were inactive.
Declines overwhelmed advances by 890 to 123, with 118 issues unchanged. The
Topix index of all first section stocks ended 28.72 or 2.2 per cent weaker
at 1,292.69.
Selling by investment trusts and individuals was noted. Of the currently
held Y3,000bn margin positions, some Y1,000bn are expected to expire this
month, with the bulk due this week. Investors expect bio-technology issues,
actively traded last autumn on margin, to be depressed on unwinding.
Meiji Milk Products, which surged last year on development of an anti-Aids
drug, dipped Y8 to Y728, and Okamoto Industries, the leading condom maker,
retreated Y60 to Y1,090.
Bank shares fell. Investors were discouraged by last week's comments from Mr
Alan Greenspan, US Federal Reserve Board chairman, hinting that an easing of
Bank of International Settlements' capital-to-asset rules was undesirable.
Industrial Bank of Japan dropped Y70 to Y1,730 and Fuji Bank Y120 to Y1,310.
High-technology issues declined as foreigners, who have been leading buyers
recently, were absent. Hitachi shed Y9 to Y823 and Sony Y70 to Y4,120.
Two chemical companies of the Mitsui group were initially sought on reports
of a possible merger. However, Mitsui Toatsu Chemicals was finally Y4 down
at Y356 and Mitsui Petrochemical Y10 off at Y610 after announcements that
they had yet to discuss specific plans.
In Osaka, the OSE average fell 430.41 to 19,429.98 in volume of 6.1m shares.
Turnover plunged to the lowest level since April 1958 as investors remained
sidelined. Prices fell across the board, with Shimano, the bicycle maker,
down Y70 to Y1,310 and Ono Pharmaceutical Y210 lower at Y5,200.
Roundup
MARKETS on the Pacific Rim were mixed yesterday, but Hong Kong, Australia
and New Zealand were closed. Bombay was shut for the second day as brokers
continued their protest against increased registration fees.
SEOUL was notable for a strong rally in small-capitalisation issues in
response to the government's announcement that it would provide loans to
help ease short-term debt.
The composite index edged up 0.02 to 587.81 in turnover of Won303.95bn or
25.57m shares, against 18.43m shares in Saturday's half-day session.
TAIWAN picked up in thin trade. The weighted index recovered 19.93 to
4,547.74 in turnover of TDollars 11.66bn, after TDollars 11.7bn during
Saturday's half-day trading.
Analysts said investors have been concerned that the three-day programme of
demonstrations staged by the Democratic Progressive Party, the country's
largest opposition party, may cause disruption. The demonstrations, which
end today, are appealing for a popular vote in 1993 on the election of the
president.
Yangming Marine, which became listed yesterday, rose TDollars 1.1 to
TDollars 17.1. The government has released 100m shares, 11 per cent of the
state-owned group, to the public under the privatisation programme.
Construction and cement shares led the day's gains.
SINGAPORE closed slightly ahead in thin volume. The Straits Times Industrial
index added 2.18 at 1,412.79 in volume of 23.21m shares.
MANILA gained ground, mainly because of a strong performance by Philippine
Long Distance Telephone, which rose 20 pesos to 880 pesos. The composite
index moved up 5.42 to 1,176.22 in turnover of 172.25m pesos.
Analysts said sentiment had improved following the release of a number of
positive economic indicators.
KUALA LUMPUR's composite index declined 3.29 to 572.46 in volume of 21.3m
shares worth MDollars 55.1m, compared with 26.9m on Friday valued at
MDollars 59.4m.
Arab-Malaysian Finance was the most active stock with some 3.9m shares
changing hands. It finished 52 cents ahead at MDollars 3.52.
Genting lost 20 cents to MDollars 11.50, while Malaysian Airline System,
Malayan Banking and Tanjong slipped 10 cents each to MDollars 6.80, MDollars
7.70 and MDollars 10.90 respectively.
BANGKOK weakened on news that opposition parties plan to protest at the
selection of the new prime minister. The SET index fell 14.04 to 808.84 in
turnover of Bt4.74bn.
Bangkok Land lost Bt9 to Bt170, while Krisda Mahanakorn, a leading property
company, eased Bt2 to Bt234.
Siam Cement shed Bt4 to Bt550, Bangkok Bank Bt8 to Bt708, Thai Farmers Bank
Bt10 to Bt502 and Siam Commercial Bank Bt16 to Bt752.

FT  21 APR 92 / International Capital Markets: The incredible shrinking
banks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY HARRIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When you meet one stockbroker in the Square Mile who says he banks with the
Woolwich, and the next you run into recommends the Northern Rock, you don't
need second sight to guess that something is going on. Depositors are
getting fed up with the British clearing banks, provoked by sloppy service
and above all by ever-rising, arbitrary charges. Meanwhile, would-be
borrowers are either turned down flat, or charged usurious rates; and old
borrowers cut their spending to pay down debt.
For the banks, strapped for capital, these impositions make short-term
sense, since they raise income while shrinking the balance sheet. The
long-term effects will be far more important than a marketing windfall for
the building societies and the Girobank. The flight from the banks will damp
down whatever recovery we may hope to see, especially in asset values, and
make Bank of England restraint largely redundant. This is not a transitory
effect: the private sector squeeze could last as long as it takes, say, to
let Canary Wharf.
On the positive side, it will open almost-forgotten opportunities for the
capital markets. Rights issues will remain the big source of capital for
expansion. Since big companies now have better credit ratings than their
banks, the commercial paper market may grow to fill the major role it does
in New York - where commercial banks' credit went ex-growth years ago - or
now in Tokyo.
In the longer run, as slow growth reduces real interest rates to normal
levels, it may even fulfil the Bank of England's long-cherished ambition to
revive the corporate debenture market. All this suggests better times for
brokers, but worse, surely, for investors.
The change will open up a whole new monetarist debate. Should analysts be
Big Endians like Professor Congdon, and follow something really broad, like
M4. This would follow the money as it moves out of the banks. Or do you
prefer M2, which concentrates on banks, since it reflects the present funk
in the banks, and will revive, in due course, with their confidence? Or is
the Treasury's M0 the only reliable guide, since it alone distinguishes
transactions from the pensioner's investments?
I have seen all these views in well-regarded brokers' circulars in the last
week. This one will run and run.
* * *
These changes are intriguing, but they are the merest trivia compared with
what may happen in Tokyo. The whole Japanese system, based on an extreme
form of relationship banking, is now endangered, possibly fatally, as the
cross-holdings become uncrossed. As David Hale of Kempers, the Chicago
house, points out in a fascinating circular, this could make Japan just
another short-termist stock market economy.
Japanese banks invested in shares to secure future loan business, and so
demanded only growth. They are now selling their holdings to insurance
companies, funds and individuals who demand profits and dividends -
secondary considerations in Tokyo up to now. The turn may take some time to
negotiate. Companies still have to refinance their convertible bond issues,
so the cost of their existing capital will rise sharply, quite apart from
expansion capital.
Small wonder that the Tokyo market remains demoralised while it works out
these unfamiliar sums.
Meanwhile, the Japanese investor seems to be seeking high returns overseas.
The insurance companies have been seen in the bond markets; funds and
individuals may be attracted by equities. The flow has at any rate been
enough to depress the yen despite the huge continuing current accounts
surplus. It may remain week as the big manufacturing companies increase
their direct foreign investment - notably in China, at the moment - where
the prospective returns are greatest.
And what of all the warnings that the troubles of Tokyo banks would
undermine capital markets everywhere else? Never, it seems at the moment,
have so many got so much so wrong.
The danger, as Hale points out, is likely to emerge not from the collapse,
but when the next Tokyo bull run begins; but to judge from the charts which
have served so well till now, we may have some years to wait.

FT  21 APR 92 / International Bonds: Emu concerns raise yields in Ecu sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
POST-Maastricht euphoria in the Ecu bond market has evaporated, as fears
about the ratification of the treaty on European monetary union surfaced in
recent weeks.
The agreement on European monetary union reached by European Community
governments at Maastricht in December was supposed to remove the uncertainty
surrounding the future of the European currency unit which had been
undermining the Ecu bond market. In the wake of Maastricht, bond prices
raced ahead, as predicted, and, at the start of 1992, the outlook for the
market appeared propitious.
Several months later, the surge of new bond issues has dried up in the face
of investor disinterest.
The disappointing performance of European bond markets has pushed Ecu yields
higher, and, as a result of worries about ratification, Ecu bonds have
underperformed other European bond markets.
'Ratification of the treaty, which must occur before it comes into effect on
January 1, 1993, is not just a case of 'rubber-stamping',' said Mr Paul
Hammett, an economist at Paribas Capital Markets. 'New laws and, in some
countries, constitutional changes are required.'
Fears have been stirred by the approach of referenda on monetary union in
Denmark on June 2, and in Ireland on June 18. In addition, there has been
pressure for a referendum in France, although the treaty could be ratified
by parliament, where a three-fifths majority is needed. However the market
has been most rattled by anti-monetary union stirrings in Germany, where the
issues of loss of sovereignty and of their own currency have come to the
fore. This change of mood in Germany has highlighted the lack of debate over
monetary union within most European nations - apart from the UK and the
Netherlands - until now.
In the last few weeks, there has been substantial selling of Ecu bonds by
large institutional accounts, pushing yields back to pre-Maastricht levels.
Central banks, which have been a particularly important investor base in
this market, have been the main sellers.
'There has been a small amount of retail buying, but that has been no match
for large-scale institutional selling,' one Ecu bond trader said.
However, sentiment improved somewhat last week, as the threat of a
realignment of the Exchange Rate Mechanism faded. Following the election
victory of the ruling Conservative party in the UK on April 9, sterling
rallied strongly, removing fears that the currency's weakness within the ERM
would force a realignment.
In fact, the risk of realignment is now probably the lowest it has ever
been, and the prospect of sterling's move to the narrow band of the ERM has
further buoyed sentiment. The completion of a series of European elections
has also ended some political uncertainty.
In addition, fears about the future of the treaty may have been overplayed,
partly because the initial euphoria after Maastricht was overdone. 'The
chances of the treaty falling through are exceedingly small,' said Mr Neil
Rogers, bond analyst at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew. 'But when Ecu yields are the
lowest in the European Community bar German yields (as they were in the wake
of Maastricht), you have to question whether the market is offering any
value.'
Mr Hammett of Paribas also believes the risk of non-ratification is low,
warning of 'misguided pessimism'.
But there is little prospect of investors returning to the sector with any
enthusiasm, at least until European bond markets start to show some
direction. A cut in German interest rates, or even strong expectations of a
cut, would provide a much-needed fillip.
Meanwhile, activity in the new issues market, which surged at the start of
the year, is likely to remain subdued. There is little sign of any increase
of corporate bond issuance, since rates are not particularly attractive and
swap opportunities are scarce.
However, the supply of paper from European governments keen to demonstrate
their political commitment to the market is likely to continue, though at a
slower pace. Issuance may pick up in the second half of the year, especially
if market conditions improve as expected.
Many issuers are currently adopting a 'wait-and-see' approach. Spain, for
example, has not yet tapped the market this year, but is expected to raise
funds later in the year.
For countries such as Spain, the Ecu market offers an opportunity to pay
lower interest rates, without taking on any significant currency risk, as
well as making a political point. Portugal, which recently joined the ERM,
could be ready to raise Ecu funds later this year.
Belgium is about to start issuing Ecu commercial paper, but is not expected
to issue longer-term debt, under its new domestic bond programme, until
later in the year.
Meanwhile, for countries with lower interest rates, the interest rate
penalty for tapping the Ecu market has shrunk. While there is still no
prospect of activity from Germany, the Netherlands could decide to tap the
market later this year.
In fact, Ecu yields fell below Dutch government bond yields in the wake of
Maastricht, though that differential has now widened to more than 30 basis
points. If Portugal and Holland raise Ecu funds later this year, it is quite
likely that by the end of the year Germany will be the only significant EC
member not to have tapped the market.
However, there is a limited amount of issuance on the cards over the coming
weeks. This week, the UK plans to raise Ecu500m through its three-year note
programme, and Italy is expected to issue five-year CTE's under its domestic
bond programme, which could trigger some swap-driven Eurobond activity.

FT  21 APR 92 / Finnish Bonds: Extra borrowing another blow to investors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Finnish government bond market has had a turbulent time. Short-term
interest rates shot skywards in early April, pushing up yields on
longer-dated debt. In addition, the government is expected to issue heavily
over the next few months, a factor which could depress the market.
The sudden plunge in Finnish bond prices this month took some investors by
surprise. Until recently, the Finnish government bond market had a certain
allure: it offered high real return as interest rates hovered around 11 per
cent, while inflation, which has fallen, is now below 3 per cent.
Although the market is small and lacks significant long-dated issues,
traders expected the government to increase the maturity range to provide a
liquid 10-year pure government bond - as opposed to the existing 10-year
housing bond.
Bond dealers say some international investors bought Finnish government
bonds on the convergence argument, encouraged by the Finnish markka's link
to the Ecu and the fact that Finland has applied for EC membership. However,
hopes of profiting from a gradual decline in interest rates were cruelly
dashed.
Mr Rolf Kullberg, governor of the Bank of Finland, announced on April 3 he
planned to resign. This followed a public row with the prime minister, Mr
Esko Aho. Fears of a devaluation quickly forced up short-term interest
rates, pulling up the yields on government bonds by as much as 1 percentage
point. An estimated FM5bn to FM10bn flooded out of the country.
The government was forced to put together an emergency economic package that
weekend, promising FM10bn in expenditure cuts, and Mrs Sirkka Hamalainen was
quickly installed as the new governor at the central bank.
Promises of support for the markka from the Bundesbank and the central banks
of Sweden, Denmark and Norway helped calm the markets. The one-month
Helsinki interbank offered rate (Helibor), which shot up to 25 per cent,
soon fell, and the yield on seven-year government bonds, which had climbed
as high as 12 per cent, is now slightly lower.
Although the crisis scared some foreign investors, there has been renewed
buying interest from those hoping to benefit from a future fall in interest
rates, according to analysts.
The Bank of Finland reports an inflow of capital, but the crisis may well
have jolted the confidence of investors.
Traders expect the government to issue up to FM40bn of bonds this year.
Before the crisis, they had expected half to be markka bonds, mainly in the
domestic market, and the remainder in the international market. However,
with the rise in domestic interest rates, the government may borrow much
less than half the amount in the domestic market.

FT  21 APR 92 / UK Gilts: Conditions set for continued rally
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GILT market looks set to be busy over the next few months, with signs of
strong demand from domestic and overseas investors for the large issues of
the securities in the pipeline.
With the political outlook settled after the Tories' surprise win in the
general election, and inflation heading for further falls, the conditions
are in place for a continued rally in the market, with a further drop in
yields. The main worry for investors is the volume of new gilts to be issued
by the Bank of England to pay for rising public borrowing.
The Pounds 30bn or so of gilts likely to be made available to investors over
the next year will limit the scope for a large drop in yields, putting a lid
on any rise in prices.
Much the same calculations apply for bonds issued by other European
governments. With France and Germany likely to issue large amounts of
securities over the next two years to finance their borrowing needs, yields
for European government bonds generally may be kept relatively high to
attract purchasers.
Last week, the gilt market paused for breath after the four-point surge in
prices in the 24 hours after the election result on April 9. As a result,
the market saw only a relatively small downward movement in yields.
Despite this, it had little trouble digesting an issue of Pounds 800m worth
of gilts announced by the Bank on April 13. The selling of this stock in a
matter of hours means the Bank has, since the start of the 1992-93 financial
year, found buyers for some Pounds 5bn worth of securities.
At the end of last week, the 10 per cent Treasury bond maturing in 1994 was
quoted at 101 1/8 , a rise of  1/8 of a point. The yield was pushed down
from 9.54 per cent to 9.4 per cent. The longer-dated 9 per cent Treasury
gilt due in 2008 saw a  1/2 point gain, with a closing price of 99. Its
yield went down from 9.08 per cent to 9.03 per cent.
In the past week, gilt specialists have reported strong demand for the
securities from investors in Germany and Japan. The allure of the bonds to
overseas buyers is helped by the strength of sterling since the election
result, and the perception that Britain is on its way to achieving low
inflation due to the link between the pound and the D-Mark via the European
exchange rate mechanism (ERM).
In recent days, economic data have provided hesitant signs of a recovery in
the UK economy, gripped by recession for nearly two years. Seasonally
adjusted unemployment in March rose by just 7,400, the smallest monthly
increase for nearly two years, while manufacturing output jumped in February
by a higher-than-expected 1.1 per cent.
The concern over funding was, however, underlined by a record Pounds 6.4bn
public-sector borrowing requirement in March, the last month of the 1991-92
financial year. This brought the borrowing figure for the year to Pounds
13.9bn, compared with a small net repayment of Pounds 465m the year before.
In 1992-93 the Treasury expects the figure to be Pounds 28bn.
The rising figure for borrowing will probably not pose too many problems for
the gilt market in the next few months. That is the view of Mr Stephen Bell,
UK economist at Morgan Grenfell and gilts adviser to Deutsche Bank, which
owns Morgan Grenfell and has just become a market-maker in the securities.
According to Mr Bell, gilt yields are likely to fall over the next six
months by about 0.4 of a percentage point, continuing the broad trend of
falling yields for the securities which started around the middle of last
year. Yields for German bonds - which act as a benchmark for the European
government bond market - are likely to see a similar fall.
However, he thinks that by the end of 1992 the volume of funding in the
pipeline by Germany, Britain and France could start to create problems for
the European bond market. With these three governments likely to issue
between them more than Pounds 200bn worth of bonds over the next two years,
the volume of securities for which the governments will be seeking buyers
will depress any tendency for a further drop in yields, and keep prices
relatively low.

FT  21 APR 92 / International Company News: International business helps
Philip Morris to Dollars 1bn profit
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STRONG performances by Philip Morris's international food and tobacco
operations helped it to after-tax profits of Dollars 1.09bn in the first
three months of 1992.
The US tobacco and food group's net profits in the same period a year ago
bore the impact of a Dollars 921m charge for accounting changes. Even with
this stripped out, there was an underlying increase of 19.5 per cent, from
Dollars 920m, while pre-tax earnings rose 18.5 per cent to Dollars 1.91bn.
Earnings per share were up by 21.2 per cent to Dollars 1.20.
Despite the improvement, operating revenues fell slightly, by 1.2 per cent
to Dollars 14.05bn. This reflected currency transactions and lower sales
from the recession-hit food operations in North America. Its shares shaded
1/4 to Dollars 78 1/2 on the news.
On the tobacco side, Philip Morris saw a 13.4 per cent operating profits
advance overall, although the volume of cigarettes shipped fell by 3.5 per
cent - partly because of the timing of Russian shipments.
Domestic market share was put at 41.6 per cent.

FT  21 APR 92 / International Company News: SMI slips to L12.2bn despite
sales surge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SOCIETA Metallurgica Italiana (SMI), the Italian company which is now
Europe's biggest maker of semi-finished copper and alloy products, more than
doubled group sales to L3,013bn (Dollars 2,437.70m) last year from L1,495bn
in 1990.
The surge in sales stemmed from SMI's long-awaited acquisition in December
1990 of Kabelmetal, the German non-ferrous metals producer formerly owned by
MAN.
However, buoyant profits from Kabelmetal - thanks to continuing strong
demand in Germany - failed to prevent a sharp fall in SMI's group earnings
last year owing to falling product prices and recession in a number of
European markets.
Net group earnings after minority interests slipped to just L12.2bn from
L12.7bn in 1990. Profits before minorities rose to L30.3bn from L15.7bn in
1990.
In spite of the profits fall, SMI stressed its confidence in the business by
dipping into reserves to pay an unchanged dividend of L35 for ordinary
shares and L70 for savings shares.
Mr Luigi Orlando, chairman and controlling shareholder, said Spanish and
French operations had lost money last year, while Italy had held its own. He
blamed the results on poor demand and severe price competition, particularly
from state-owned competitors.
SMI also suffered from heavy interest charges, which amounted to around
L100bn at group level last year, said Mr Sergio Ceccuzzi, managing director.
Much of the borrowing stemmed from funding the Kabelmetal purchase, which
was originally intended to have been paid in stages over a number of years,
but was subsequently renegotiated.
Mr Orlando said SMI's priority now was to exploit economies of scale and
bring down its cost base. Only when earnings were clearly improving would it
be possible to turn to shareholders for new capital to bring down debt, now
standing at around L900bn, he stressed.

Cummins Engine, the Indiana-based diesel engine and heavy-duty truck
manufacturer, unveiled a small turnround to first-quarter net profits of
Dollars 8.6m from losses of Dollars 34.3m a year earlier, AP-DJ reports from
New York.
The company benefited from cost-cutting, while demand for its mid-range
engines remained strong. Sales were roughly unchanged at Dollars 881.3m and
earnings per share came to 45 cents compared with losses of Dollars 2.44.
*****
Capital Cities/ABC, the US media group, reported a fall in first-quarter
earnings to Dollars 41.7m, or Dollars 2.51 a share, on revenues of Dollars
1.1bn, down from Dollars 58.6m, or Dollars 3.50 a share, on revenues of
Dollars 1.26bn in the year-earlier quarter, Reuter reports from New York.
The company said advertising demand had started to improve in the current
second quarter, despite the continuing sluggish economy.
*****
LSI Logic, the leading US maker of application-specific semiconductor
devices, showed a sharp drop in first-quarter figures, Louise Kehoe reports
from San Francisco.
Revenues fell to Dollars 151m, down 16 per cent from Dollars 180m. Net
income slid 85 per cent to Dollars 309,000, or 1 cent a share, from Dollars
2.1m, or 5 cents a share, in the first quarter of 1991.
*****
Burlington Northern, one of the large US railroad companies, reported
first-quarter profits of Dollars 80m after-tax, compared with Dollars 8m in
the first quarter of 1991, Nikki Tait reports. Sales totalled Dollars .19bn,
higher than the Dollars 1.13bn in 1990.
Burlington said first-quarter profits included a Dollars 47m non-operating
credit, resulting from litigation matters, partially offset by an Dollars
18m charge resulting from accounting changes.
*****
Ralston Purina, the world's largest pet food and livestock feeds group,
unveiled a fall in second-quarter net profits to Dollars 86.1m, or 76 cents
a share, from Dollars 98.4m, or 84 cents, a year earlier, AP-DJ reports from
St Louis. Sales were Dollars 1.88bn, up from Dollars 1.82bn.
For the first half, net profits fell to Dollars 216.8m from Dollars 233.7m
on sales ahead at Dollars 3.9bn against Dollars 3.78bn. Earnings per share
slid to Dollars 1.90 from Dollars 2.10.
*****
Weyerhaeuser, the paper and pulp group, reported after-tax profits of
Dollars 86.6m in the first three months of 1992, a substantial improvement
on the Dollars 47.9m (before an accounting adjustment) seen in the same
period a year earlier, Nikki Tait reports.
*****
Noranda Forest, Canada's biggest forest products group, reduced
first-quarter losses to CDollars 24m (USDollars 20.3m), or 21 cents a share,

reports from Montreal. Sales were CDollars 1.05bn against CDollars 1.03bn.
*****
Georgia-Pacific, the US building products and paper company, saw a net
profit of Dollars 43m in the first quarter, compared with a loss of Dollars
7116m a year ago, Nikki Tait reports.
*****
Scott Paper, the leading Canadian tissue products group, turned in net

SEARS, Roebuck, the large Chicago-based retail and financial services group,
has reported a modest Dollars 16.5m profit at its troubled retail division
in the first quarter of 1992.
This compares with a Dollars 14.1m loss a year earlier. However, comparisons
are still muddied by one-off items. In the merchandise division, which is
being overhauled, a Dollars 54.5m after-tax gain from the sale of a minority
interest in Sears Mexico more than offset a Dollars 38.5m restructuring
charge, largely for severance costs.
The retailer also reported that merchandise revenues rose just 3.3 per cent,
to Dollars 6.85bn. Domestic store sales improved, it said, but Sears Canada
and the catalogue operations decreased.
The financial services operations fared better. Allstate, the large
insurance group owned by Sears, reported profits of Dollars 261.1m, up 22.2
per cent.
Dean Witter, the securities house subsidiary, made profits of Dollars
143.5m, compared with Dollars 78.1m a year ago.

FT  21 APR 92 / UK Company News: Avonmore buys meat plants
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   DUBLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AVONMORE FOODS, the Irish dairy and food products group, has paid IPounds
5.5m for four meat processing plants owned by the collapsed United Meat
Packers Group. The acquisitions mark Avonmore's first venture into Irish
beef processing and will give it an estimated seven per cent of the
republic's market.
The plants, at Sligo, Ballyhaunis and Ballaghaderreen, in the west, and at
Camolin, in the south-east of the country, have a combined slaughtering
capacity of 4,750 cattle and 27,500 sheep a week. Avonmore's chief
executive, Mr Pat O'Neill, said the company intended to invest up to IPounds
8m to modernise the plants and bring them up to EC standards.
A fifth UMP plant, at Charleville, County Cork, has been bought by the
privately-owned group, Dairygold, for IPounds 4m. One further plant remains
to be sold.
UMP, owned by Pakistani businessman, Mr Sher Rafique, was put into
receivership in February with debt of over IPounds 60m, owed mainly to
overseas banks. The receiver, Mr John Donnelly, of Deloitte &amp; Touche, was
under strong pressure from unions, farmers and the Irish government to make
a quick sale to protect as many as possible of the 600 jobs at the plants.
Most of the employees are expected to be re-hired as the plants are brought
back into production over the next few weeks.
The government was also keen to see plants sold to strong public companies,
which it hopes will bring some stability to an important but fragmented
industry. Much of the country's beef-processing industry is still in private
hands and is severely under-capitalised.
Further rationalisation may result in the aftermath of the UMP collapse.
The purchase of the four plants is Avonmore's second strategic acquisition
in just over a week following the purchase of UK processor, Barretts and
Bairds, 10 days ago. Avonmore is also expected to announce soon the purchase
of Williams Group, the Irish family-owned milling and malting company.

FT  21 APR 92 / UK Company News: Lower prices leave Ibstock 50% down at
Pounds 10.6m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FALLING prices in its key markets of bricks and paper pulp knocked 1991
profits at Ibstock Johnsen down by more than 50 per cent, writes Angus
Foster.
Pre-tax profits for the year fell to Pounds 10.6m. That compared with Pounds
23.6m a year ago, or Pounds 30m after restating a Pounds 6.4m restructuring
charge as an exceptional rather than extraordinary item.
A final dividend of 3.75p makes a same-gain uncovered total of 6p, as
promised during last year's Pounds 44m rights issue.
Turnover fell from Pounds 342.3m to Pounds 285.3m. In the UK, operating
profits fell by 56 per cent to Pounds 9.79m as overcapacity in the brick
industry forced margins down from 27 to 15 per cent.
Forestry and pulprecorded an operating loss of Pounds 1.38m (Pounds 8.18m
profit) as pulp prices fell 18 per cent.
Interest receivable increased to Pounds 1.52m (Pounds 232,000) from the
proceeds of the rights issue.
Earnings dropped to 2.58p (5.62p).
COMMENT
Ibstock's decision to increase brick output by 15m by rebuilding its West
Sussex plant seems odd when the market reeks of overcapacity. But the
company is tempted because the south of England is the only net importer of
bricks, and is betting on improving market share through transport savings.
Nevertheless, it is difficult to see this year being anything but testing
and by its own admission, the dividend is at risk.

FT  21 APR 92 / Economics Notebook: Time to find a free trade vision in the
crystal ball
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The high season for crystal ball gazing is here again.
Over the next four weeks, those two august guardians of the world economy -
the International Monetary Fund and the Organisation for Economic
Co-operation and Development - will publish new forecasts for global growth,
inflation and trade.
The good news is that both bodies will project a gradual recovery that
should see the world economy growing in line with long-term trends in about
18 month's time.
The bad news is that both have been singing the same tune for more than a
year during which the point of recovery has been postponed and clear
evidence of economic revival has remained elusive. There will be a strong
sense of deja vu about the latest IMF forecast when published this week.
A year ago, the fund projected world economic growth of 2.9 per cent in 1992
after an anaemic 1.2 per cent last year. The IMF is now expected to forecast
world growth of about 3.5 per cent - but for 1993 - after 1.5 per cent in
1992.
A similar story of postponed prosperity comes from the Paris-based OECD. It
recently cut its internal growth projection for the industrialised world in
1992 to between 1.5 per cent and 2 per cent from 2.2 per cent predicted in
December.
But what significance should be attached to these forecasting errors?
Will it always be a case of 'jam tomorrow' as far as economic recovery is
concerned, or do special factors lie behind the delayed upturn?
If economists agree on one thing, it is that it is very difficult to spot
turning points in activity in advance. Since the late 1980s, this problem
has been exaggerated by the effects of fast growing indebtedness and
subsequent asset price deflation in, first, the English-speaking economies
of the US, the UK and Australia and, now, Japan.
But the forecasting failures have also highlighted mistaken policy choices.
Virtually all countries consider that low inflation is a necessary
pre-condition for sustained and balanced growth - and here the success
achieved in pushing inflation lower is promising for the world economy.
But it has also become clear that over-reliance on monetary policy to combat
price rises has damaged economic activity.
blunt instrument was acknowledged last week by one of the world's most
committed inflation fighters: the Reserve Bank of New Zealand. It admitted
that there was some validity in arguments that it should have eased monetary
policy earlier than September last year. The bank, which has responsibility
for getting annual inflation within a zero to 2 per cent band by the end of
1993, has already brought it below 1 per cent but at the cost of very low
growth.
Similar doubts can be heard in Canada, where inflation has fallen to around
2 per cent after a deep recession. The length and depth of Britain's
recession also suggest that it was a mistake to hold bank base rates at 15
per cent for a full year until October 1990 while sterling was allowed to
rise in value ahead of entry into the European exchange rate mechanism.
Conversely, easier monetary policy cannot be guaranteed to deliver sound
economic recovery on its own. The US Federal Reserve System has pushed
interest rates to their lowest levels for nearly 30 years. But the recovery
remains fragile and is likely to be weak compared with previous US
experience, largely because of the huge and persistent US budget deficit
that raises fears of future inflation among investors in US bonds.
For these reasons, we can expect to hear a lot more about the need for
better policy mixes in the months and years ahead. A debate on this issue is
likely at next Sunday's meeting of ministers and central bankers from the
Group of Seven industrialised countries in Washington.
Governments agree that one of the best ways of securing continuing
prosperity in the long term is to curb public spending and reduce fiscal
deficits. But reducing fiscal deficits is a difficult and politically
unrewarding task at the best of times. At present, none of the major
industrial countries - with the possible exception of Japan - has a
particularly strong fiscal position.
Yet fiscal sobriety is unlikely to help Japan in the G7 meeting. Instead,
the authorities in Tokyo, who are struggling to control an increasingly
worrying attack of asset price deflation, are likely to be under pressure to
borrow more to boost their own economy and so prevent Japan's threatened
recession crimping growth abroad.
It is easy to see how the policy mix debate could turn into one about
issues, which although important, will go only a part of the way to
achieving stable economic growth. But there is one area - trade - where a
bold stroke could deliver more.
A new study* by two OECD economists claims that the removal of global trade
barriers would yield annual economic gains of Dollars 475bn (Pounds 268bn)
after 10 years, with Dollars 255bn accruing to the OECD member states and
Dollars 220bn to developing and former communist countries. Completing the
Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations would bring gains of
Dollars 195bn and more than Dollars 90bn respectively in the same time
frame.
The virtues of freer trade were underlined last week by Mr Nicholas Brady,
the US Treasury Secretary. US exports to Mexico had increased from Dollars
10bn to Dollars 33bn a year in the past five years as the two countries
lowered their barriers. Nor were the benefits confined to US states on the
Mexican border: the third biggest beneficiary after Texas and California was
Michigan.
Mr Brady said the benefits of freer trade were 'so clear' one could hope
that 'the individual counties would do the right thing'. It is view shared
by virtually all G7 finance ministers. Unfortunately, they are not
responsible for the Uruguay Round negotiations.

FT  21 APR 92 / GPA shareholders revolt over sale
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GPA Group, the aircraft lessor, is facing a shareholder revolt over the
terms of the sale which could jeopardise the Pounds 1.7bn flotation
scheduled for June.
Japanese investors and airline companies commanding almost a third of GPA's
shareholding have refused to give the aircraft leasing company details of
the amount of shares they plan to sell in the float.
Advisers to GPA say the sale of new and existing shares cannot go ahead
until they have a 'lock-up' agreement preventing existing shareholders from
selling more than an agreed amount during and immediately after the sale.
The advisers are trying to create an orderly market for six to 12 months
after the float.
To this end Hambro Magan, the specialist merchant bank advising Mr Tony
Ryan, GPA's chairman, wrote to investors asking them to indicate the amount
of shares they wanted to sell. However, GPA's biggest shareholders have
ignored the deadline of midnight last Wednesday. Only Mr Ryan and Mr Maurice
Foley, chief executive, have agreed not to dispose of their holdings in the
float.
Air Canada and Aer Lingus, which command 24.8 per cent of GPA's
shareholding, want to sell a big proportion of their shareholding. The two
airline companies, which are being advised by Warburgs, have refused to
accept a limit, proposed by GPA's advisers, of between 5 and 15 per cent of
each shareholding.
GPA hopes it can reach an agreement with the airline companies since they
want the sale to go ahead.
More worrying for GPA is the attitude of its Japanese investors, who have no
incentive to see the sale proceed, since they bought much of their stock at
Dollars 32 a share. The flotation price, which still has to be agreed, is
likely to be about Dollars 22, which would confirm a loss on some Japanese
investors' shareholdings. The Japanese investors, which include Mitsubishi
Trust and Banking Corporation with 12.8m shares or 13.4 per cent of the
stock, have said they are unhappy with the sale terms.
According to one of GPA advisers the Japanese position is causing the group
'serious concern'.
GPA's advisers include Japan's Nomura International as global co-ordinator,
Merrill Lynch and Goldman Sachs in the US and Schroders in the UK.

Hoesch, and converted the whole group into a public limited company, ready
for the stock market this summer.
Despite this flurry of activity, Mr Cromme is uncomfortable with his popular
tag as the model new-generation German manager. He oozes traditional
conservatism; twitches at the thought of Anglo-American aggression in the
mergers and acquisitions arena. Yet was he not the man who hijacked Hoesch?
'I am not a raider,' he replies. 'I am an industrialist with a sensible
industrial concept.' In the controversy over his takeover of Hoesch, people
had lost sight of the fact that the rationale for the merger was accepted by
both supervisory boards, politicians and unions 10 years ago. 'It was not
realisable at the time, (because Krupp backed away) but I have realised it,'
he says.
He has been called clumsy and short-sighted by those who prefer German
industry's traditional painstaking consensus-building. Within 12 months of
returning to Germany to take charge of Krupp's tired steel division, Krupp
Stahl, after 15 years at Saint-Gobain in France, Mr Cromme had run into his
first wave of criticism. Outrage, flying tomatoes, and the epithet 'the
grave-digger' accompanied his closure of the 4m-tonne Rheinhausen integrated
steel mill in Duisburg.
The mill was losing DM200m (Pounds 68m) a year. In 1989-90 Krupp Stahl paid
its first dividend for 16 years, and will pay another for 1991. Mr Cromme
was promoted to head the whole group.
Last autumn, criticism resurfaced over his acquisition of Hoesch, pride of
Dortmund. Once again, said his critics, he had used un-German tactics,
adding momentum to his ambition by secretly acquiring a 25 per cent stake in
the target and teasing enough pledges out of other shareholders to give
Krupp a majority. 'There was a wide consensus. The only problem was that the
people in Dortmund were taken by surprise.'
To his colleagues, Mr Cromme is Krupp's - maybe Germany's - best
international manager. He has polished French, sound English, and he is
relatively young. He has an uncommonly straightforward demeanour, and a
preference for action.
Before the takeover, Hoesch's management was working on a restructuring plan
called Hoesch 2000. Fat would be trimmed, sales would fall to DM10bn from
around DM13bn at present, but the reinvigorated Hoesch would bounce back and
report DM18bn turnover at the end of decade.
Krupp believes, however, the merger will achieve a comparable revival of
Hoesch within 12 months once the deal is completed this summer. The German
cartel office has required only one small disposal. Brussels anti-trust
officials are still looking at some minor aspects of the merger but they are
not going to block it.
The main thrust of Mr Cromme's thinking is doggedly long-term. Ten or 20
years from now, he says, the corporate cultures of Europe will grow
naturally together. Takeover rules will be agreed, possibly through
Brussels, assimilating the best from all worlds. 'On the other hand, I think
we will not see wasteful, world-scale financially-motivated takeovers. We
will only do deals which have industrial logic.'
And Mr Cromme himself has no taste for more takeovers. The company will now
concentrate on building competitiveness in its strongest businesses, and in
the meantime try to find partners to improve this quality in others.
Five years on, Mr Cromme says, the enlarged Krupp group will stand on the
legs which support it and Hoesch today: steel, plant construction, steel
processing, engineering, trading and vehicle components. He entertains no
dreams of ironing out the cyclical bumps, to which all his businesses are
prone, by rampant diversification. 'If we do it right, even with steel, we
can make money - not every year perhaps - but over the years we can climb,'
he says.
The other German steelmakers are now urgently examining merger deals to
allow them to compete with the two leaders, Krupp and Thyssen. The
half-dozen significant steel producers in Germany at present will eventually
come down to two or three, says Mr Cromme. 'We have to have the synergies of
scale to compete internationally.' The British, French and Italian giants
have three hot strip mills each. 'Is it possible for a steel company in
Germany to have the same synergies with just one?'
As well as critical mass, Krupp and Hoesch together have gained another
advantage, he says. 'We are so close to one another - just 20 miles apart.
Everyone in capital intensive industry knows it is important to be close
together. It gives you a big advantage in moving people and products
around,' he adds.
It also provides a firm base for Mr Cromme's next long-term move: expansion
beyond what he calls his 'regional' market in Europe, reaching out with
advanced, bespoke products for customers the world over.
He is naturally not immune to the immediate concerns exercising German
industry. But he is uncommonly cool on the subject. Other industrial leaders
have complained about excessive pay claims and the risks to 'Standort
Deutschland', Germany's role as a manufacturing base. The situation is not
just a matter of high labour costs, he stresses. The debate also reflects
concern about the state of the market, corporate taxes, infrastructure and
education. 'Things are not bad, but they could be better,' Mr Cromme says.
And he believes that eventually, 'when the going gets really tough' trade
unions will see the signs and accept that changed conditions demand changed
attitudes.
His assured tone falters for a moment. 'Germans have always been flexible
enough in the past to cope with changes in the environment. Now the question
is, will that flexibility be as great in the future?'
He accepts that with reunification to pay for, resources are stretched and
the country needs to set new priorities 'for one or two years'. It has to
decide if the economy can cope with costly environmental policies, rising
wages and consumption, shrinking working hours and increasing social costs
and at the same time assimilate the east.
But in the long run, as east and west Europe grow slowly together, so
Germany's advantage - its central position - will improve, he says.
Meanwhile, the country's relative advantage remains undamaged, in Mr
Cromme's eyes. 'One thing is certain, if Standort Deutschland is not in a
good condition, things will be even worse in other European countries,' he
says.

Sir, Part of the report, 'Delors signals more powers for Brussels' (April
8), in which David Buchan described a statement purportedly made by Malta's
foreign minister, is not correct.
Dr de Marco, in reply to a question, had pointed out that Luxembourg, a
founder-member of the European Community, was comparable in size to Malta,
but this had not caused any difficulty to the Community. On the contrary,
Luxembourg's performance had been exemplary.
Malta's role in a future enlarged Community likewise should pose no
problems. Dr de Marco added that, if any changes were to prove necessary as
a result of an enlargement, including the question of the number of
commissioners, Malta would co-operate, for Malta's membership application
was founded principally on the fact that it shared the objectives and ideals
of the Community, and desired to see them secured in the most efficient
manner possible.

FT  21 APR 92 / Letter: Not a fair picture of EC aid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr BRUNO DETHOMAS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Mr James Ingram, outgoing director of the World Food Programme
interviewed by Mr Robert Graham ('Food aid: demand grows, resources fall',
April 14), states that 'The European Community has been a little
disappointing' in its food aid policy.
These statements, uttered by someone who is supposedly knowledgeable on food
aid worldwide, are absolutely shocking.
The EC and its member states together are by far the largest donor to the
WFP, accounting for 35 per cent of all the resources contributed, the second
largest contributor being the US (21 per cent).
Mr Ingram cites the case of the Horn of Africa and Sudan in particular. He
does not mention the fact that, in Sudan, total aid from the EC and its
member states amounted to Ecu 100m (Dollars 130m) in 1991, while the US
contributed Ecu 14m and Japan Ecu 3m.
Just because the EC does not exclusively use the WFP to channel its aid, it
does not mean that it is doing nothing.
For 1992, the European Commission, facing an ongoing threat of famine in the
Horn and southern Africa, has proposed, as in 1991, a new emergency
programme. The total food aid contribution from the 1992 EC budget alone (ie
excluding national contributions from the Twelve) will be close to Dollars
1bn.
It is difficult to understand how Mr Ingram can be so 'disappointed' with
the EC. Arguably, all international donors could contribute more to the WFP.
But to express dissatisfaction only vis-a-vis the very largest of all donors
while considering the US 'the most responsive' does not seem very reasonable
or fair.
The Community, its member states and, above all, its citizens and taxpayers
do not deserve such a misrepresentation of their solidarity with the
developing world.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr GEOFFREY R JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Michael Prowse, in reviewing Jeremy Rifkin's book entitled 'Beyond
Beef', (April 10) does not appear to have completely suspended his critical
faculties since he describes it as a tirade, an exaggeration and a metaphor.
But he was at fault in re-cycling so much misinformation in the context of
his review.
For example, he says 'the argument about poverty is straightforward'. Would
that it were] The land conversion factors comparing the productivity of
cereals, legumes, leafy vegetables and cattle assume the same high quality
land, whereas most grazing land is too cool, too wet, too dry, too high, too
steep or too rough to be used for crops. And so, worldwide, 80-85 per cent
of the nutrients fed to cattle are not edible by humans. World hunger
experts know the real causes of hunger are poverty and distribution - not
cows.
This is just one example of the incorrect information in Mr Rifkin's book.
There are many others. It is sad that Mr Prowse has chosen to reiterate Mr
Rifkin's book rather than offer a critical review.
British consumers can continue to consume grass-based British beef from the
hills of Scotland or well-managed English and Welsh mixed farming systems
without guilt about environmental impact or resource misuse.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Sir BRIAN CORBY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your leader of April 14 ('Mr Heseltine at industry) highlighted a
number of reasons why CBI members welcome Mr Michael Heseltine's
appointment. We have long argued for a more effective and re-focused
Department of Trade and Industry.
It is, clearly, not for me to speculate about Mr Heseltine's intentions. He
is well placed and capable of speaking for himself.
But I thought that I should draw attention to a fallacy in your leader which
has important implications for Britain in Europe. You state that because Mr
Heseltine believes (with the CBI) that every company should have effective
communications with its workforce, it is 'difficult to see why Mr Heseltine
would want to resist the Social Chapter of the Maastricht Treaty'.
The reason is plain, and is summed up in the word 'subsidiarity'. We believe
that effective employee participation and communication comes from voluntary
action by companies,and that the Social Chapter of the Maastricht Treaty
will only handicap European business in its bid to compete with the rest of
the world - a view shared by our colleagues throughout Europe.
As it happens, British business has made notable progress in improving
communications and in securing the involvement and commitment of all
employees over the past five years - as our recent publication, Europe After
Maastricht, made plain.
These efforts can only be set back by bureaucratic interference from
Brussels.

Sir, Mr Bryan Cassidy is profoundly mistaken (Letters, April 14) in
attributing the current German crisis to 'Chancellor Kohl's having to depend
upon the support of the Free Democrats in coalition'. It is the Free
Democrats who advocate faster privatisation and a reduction in subsidies.
But for their presence in the government the slow response of which Mr
Cassidy complains would be slower still.
No doubt some coalition governments can lead to stagnation and mutually
imposed vetoes. But coalition partners can equally easily act as spurs, as
has been the case more than once in post-war Germany.

FT  21 APR 92 / A kiss of life from across the border: Nicholas Denton
explains why Hungary is looking to western investment to modernise industry
and fuel an economic recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS DENTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Economic reform has created more pain than gain for most of east and central
Europe, which is grappling with rising unemployment and falling incomes. But
there are growing signs that Hungary could become the first post-communist
economy to halt the spiral of decline as foreign investment rises to take up
the slack created by weakening state industries.
Hungary, the smallest of the three post-communist central European states,
is quietly attracting the lion's share of western investment into the
region.
Foreign capital of more than Dollars 1.7bn flowed into Hungary last year as
multinationals built greenfield plants and took over privatised state
companies. The cumulative total since investment was liberalised in 1988 has
now surpassed Dollars 3bn, about 60 per cent of the total for all of eastern
Europe. Even so, foreign investment can only be supplementary to the
mobilisation of domestic savings and the development of financial and other
institutions needed for the more efficient capitalist utilisation of
Hungary's own resources.
Hungary's small size makes foreign investment more visible. Capital inflows
came to more than 5 per cent of gross domestic product in 1991 - a
proportion more common in the rapidly growing economies of east Asia than
eastern Europe.
Foreign companies already dominate some industrial sectors. General Motors,
Suzuki Motor Corporation and Ford have set up Hungary's car and component
industry. Privatisation sales have placed the bulk of the cigarette,
distilling, sugar, confectionery, bread, newspaper, paper, cement and glass
industries in the hands of western groups.
The prospect, in the more technology-intensive sectors of the economy at
least, is one of western economic domination. Yet Hungary views this with an
equanimity which marks it out from its neighbours.
Hungary does not share the fears of German influence that fuel economic
xenophobia in Poland and Czechoslovakia.
It has no territorial disputes with Germany, and the two countries have been
allies for much of the period since the First World War.
Rather, the Budapest government is more wary of the potentially
destabilising effect of the disintegration of Yugoslavia to its south and
the fate of several million ethnic Hungarians in other neighbouring states.
Consequently, Hungary views the western presence as securing rather than
limiting its independence.
'National security can only be guaranteed by those big countries that have
investment here and an interest that nothing happens to it,' says Mr Istvan
Forrai, personal secretary to the prime minister, Mr Joszef Antall.
Mr Forrai would doubtless appreciate the presence of Suzuki Motor
Corporation's factory at Esztergom, which begins assembling cars this
summer. The Japanese motor manufacturer is a more welcome occupier of the
site than was its predecessor - the Red Army. Under the assembly line lies
buried the firing range of the old Soviet military base.
Budapest seeks foreign investment not only to introduce sophisticated
technology and manufacturing techniques, but also to ease domestic financial
constraints. Hungary is burdened with a foreign debt of Dollars 20bn, and
has the highest per-capita borrowings in eastern Europe. Servicing such
large borrowing is made possible only by inflows of foreign funds. The
government has taken steps to draw in western capital by implementing an
attractive investment regime. Ten-year tax concessions are available for
joint ventures in manufacturing and licences for foreigners are required
only in banking.
Policy-makers have also taken a liberal stance towards the disposal of state
industries. Privatisation has been as far as possible to state company
managers and foreign buyers have been encouraged. Last year, about 80 per
cent of privatisation sales were to foreign companies.
Cost considerations and market potential have also played their part. Labour
costs are a fraction of those in western Europe, though the gap is gradually
closing. Even at General Motors' new Szentgotthard car and engine plant,
which pays well above the average, labour costs of DM 4 (Pounds 1.40) per
hour are about a tenth of west German levels. But productivity is also low,
and companies such as General Electric have laid off thousands of workers as
part of their reorganisation.
What they have found, however, is that highly educated research and
scientific workers are significantly cheaper than in the west. GE has moved
four of its nine lighting research centres to Tungsram, its Hungarian
lightbulb-making subsidiary.
Investors, particularly from Japan and the US, have also been attracted by
Hungary's location. Situated alongside the European Community, and having
concluded a free trade pact with the EC which took effect last March,
Hungary provides a strategic export base from which to exploit western
Europe's market.
Many western companies are looking not only to meet EC demand but to
establish a presence in the Hungarian market in anticipation of the
country's eventual economic take-off.
The logic is straightforward for companies such as Unilever, the Anglo-Dutch
food and consumer products company, which recently took over the margarine,
detergent and soap business of Hungary's NMV. Mr Jan de Jong, Unilever's
regional director for continental Europe, describes the investment as a
bridgehead to establish a market share and to provide a base for expansion.
The twist is that the potential of the Hungarian market itself depends on
the ability of foreign investors to invigorate the local economy after last
year's 8 per cent drop in GDP.
Some effects of foreign capital inflows are visible. Already, these funds
have eased Hungary's balance of payments, allowing the central bank to
quintuple foreign exchange reserves from a nadir in 1990 of Dollars 800m to
more than Dollars 4bn.
In individual companies, where foreign involvement has had time to work, the
results have been impressive. In two years at its Tungsram plant, GE has
raised production by 28 per cent with 30 per cent fewer employees. The
company has made Hungary its worldwide centre for producing small
fluorescent lamp bulbs.
Joint ventures, collectively, have also performed much better than the
average Hungarian company. Sales and profits per employee are about double
the average, and hard-currency earnings per head almost triple, according to
the most recent official statistics.
For the foreign companies which have moved into Hungary, as for the
Hungarian government, the question remains whether the influx of capital and
expertise will reach the level needed to trigger general economic expansion.
When growth does resume, possibly as early as the end of the year, much of
the benefit will accrue to foreign companies. But Hungary, impatient to
raise living standards to those of its western neighbours, believes that
part of the loaf is better than none.

FT  21 APR 92 / Leading Article: Next stage of Russian reform
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE RUSSIAN government appears, for the moment, to have won its game of
chicken with the Congress of People's Deputies. That victory owes much to
the absence of any plausible alternative to the policies of the government;
it owes much to the commanding place still held by Mr Boris Yeltsin; but it
owes nothing to the enthusiasm of the people for the hardships of economic
reform.
The government may be unbowed, but it has been bloodied. It walks a
politically narrow path between the chasms of hyperinflation on the one side
and of economic collapse on the other.
Whatever its difficulties, the government must be given the benefit of the
west's doubts. It is composed of young, competent, western-oriented
technocrats and, in Mr Yegor Gaidar, possesses a leader who has grown
rapidly in stature, not least following his confrontation with the Congress.
Furthermore, it is the first government that has actually undertaken reform,
rather than just talked about it. The price liberalisation of the beginning
of the year has already eliminated queues and put downward pressure on
demand. The higher price of petrol announced yesterday is an important
further step. An announced budget deficit of less than 2 per cent of gross
domestic product in the first quarter, a credit squeeze and, by Russian
standards, high interest rates have helped to constrain inflation, even if
it remains at uncomfortably high levels. The government hopes to lower the
monthly rate of inflation to 3 per cent a month (an annual rate of 40 per
cent) by the end of the year.
Backsliding
This is good, so far as it goes; but it does not go far enough. Worse, there
is danger of backsliding. Increased monetary financing of the budget is
probable. The government is also committed to a Rbs 200bn expansion of
central bank credit to the economy, which is expected to generate a total
increase of Rbs 400bn-Rbs 500bn, a rise of about a quarter.
That expansion is supposed to be targeted selectively on agriculture,
investment and viable state enterprises. But it is also a response to an
explosive increase in inter-enterprise bad debt, now about Rbs 900bn, a
fifth of GDP. The scale of the bad debt shows how little has changed in the
behaviour of state enterprises. Equally revealing is their failure to adjust
prices to falling demand. In these circumstances, the planned monetary
expansion may simply pour monetary petrol on the hyperinflationary blaze.
Broad consensus
The government's macroeconomic difficulties, along with its increasing
determination to intervene more directly in the economy, reflect the
latter's structural defects. A radical programme of privatisation and
demonopolisation, in which currency convertibility will play an important
part, is a high priority. On this, the government and its academic critics
agree.
For the west, the case for early and generous assistance remains
overwhelming. It would remain so even if the stabilisation fund were to be
used to support an adjustable exchange rate, as the government now suggests,
rather than a fixed one.
But the price for western support must include a consistently tight monetary
and fiscal policy, swift privatisation of retail and wholesale trade, rapid
moves to world prices for the principal commodities, above all oil, and
accelerated change in the economic structure, including establishment of
clear rights for private property.
No less important is clarification of the relationship between Russia and
other members of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS). Members that
are not prepared to co-operate in monetary control should leave the rouble
area forthwith. In return, the west should help develop payment and credit
arrangements that allow energy-poor CIS states to survive when Russia moves,
as it should, to world prices.
Russia is a country of huge potential. Nothing could justify a permanent aid
programme of the scale now contemplated for this year. Large sums can be
justified, but for a strictly limited period, perhaps five years, after
which Russia will either be a recipient of huge private inflows or reform
will have failed. Russian reform remains a great gamble, but for a great
prize. The Congress has not made the bet worse. The west would still be
right to take it.

Are good teachers born or made? BBC2 tries to find out with two

different teachers: Lindsey Bird, who has had seven years experience, Peggy
Jordan who has had 22, and Matthew Longden, fresh from college, who has been
taken on to teach business studies but finds that he is also to be 10G's

40 Minutes re-tells the story of the Nazis' 'lebensborn' scheme for peopling

but never knew who her father was. When she eventually establishes his
identity it is all too clear why her mother kept it such a secret.
Channel 4 opens a 'Cinema Canada' season with Jesus Of Montreal (10.00), a

Viewpoint 92 screens the first of another pair of documentaries, this time
about the modern hatred of ageing and the lengths to which people will go to

FT  21 APR 92 / Construction Contracts: Fitting out London base
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
BOVIS CONSTRUCTION has begun work on a Pounds 50m construction management
contract to fit out the new London headquarters of the European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development, situated at One Exchange Square, 175
Bishopsgate, London EC2.
Fitting out the 367,000 sq ft of floor space involves internal partitioning,
ceilings, carpeting, decoration, data and communications installations,
lighting and air conditioning, all to high standards.
Other works include directors' offices, various facilities, a dealing room,
board room and auditorium. Structural alterations are required to meet the
design brief of the bank.
Bovis Construction, a P&amp;O company, has made a particular study of how to
improve both the quality and speed of the fitting out process. Analysis of
all factors involved has resulted in the development of new techniques and
methods of working which will enable a phased occupation of the building.

involves roundabout and bridge construction plus dualling of a section of
this route, which will require over 70,000 tonnes of coated materials. Work
on the project is currently underway.
A similar contract, valued at Pounds 4.4m, is for a package of construction
work for phase 1 of the infrastructure project for a business park at
Maybury, Edinburgh. The work was awarded by Edinburgh Park and will involve
site preparation for business units.
Other recently-awarded contracts include the construction of a pumping
station worth Pounds 1.3m at Montrose for Tayside Regional Council.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MOTT MACDONALD, based in Croydon, has been appointed by Canadian National
Railways to design the new St Clair River rail tunnel between Canada and the
US in conjunction with HATCH ASSOCIATES of Toronto.
Requiring an unusually large diameter of 9.5 metres to accommodate double
stack container freight, the two kilometre long tunnel will replace the 101
year-old existing link which cannot be enlarged owing to insufficient space
beneath the river.
The single-bore tunnel will be lined with precast concrete segments and
driven by an earth pressure balance tunnelling machine through soft glacial
clay with only five metres of cover to the tunnel crown beneath the river
bed.
Adding to the technical complexity, the project is to be built to a tight
fast-track programme, with construction scheduled to start at the end of
this year and finish by the autumn of 1994.
The role of the Hatch-Mott MacDonald joint venture will include design and
construction management of the approach junctions, open-cut portals and the
new tunnel.
Jacobs Associates of San Francisco will be responsible for cost estimating
and soils evaluation will be done by Golder Associates of Canada.
O'Brien-Kreitzberg will assist with project management.

FT  21 APR 92 / People: Hoping to make the cab fit
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
At 48, Michael Thurlow is taking up cab driving. Well, cab company driving,
to be precise; he has just moved into the managing director's seat at
Metrocab (UK).
Tamworth, Staffordshire-based Metrocab, after spending some of 1990 parked
in receivership, is back in business making the main rival to London's
famous FX4 'black taxi'.
Metrocab's assets were bought just over a year ago - following the failure
of previous owner Reliant - by Hooper group, the London vehicle
coachbuilder.
As well as steering Metrocab, Thurlow is to remain as finance director of
Hooper, which is best known for its 'customised' Rolls-Royces and Bentleys.
Thurlow, who has been with Hooper for three years after spending most of his
career in South Africa, clearly relishes his new driving role. 'I was very
much involved in setting up Metrocab (UK),' he says, 'and I'm looking
forward to running and expanding it.'
Thurlow and the current total of 100 Metrocab employees have had plenty to
occupy them since Metrocab (UK) became a formal entity last July. The
plastic-bodied, purpose-built taxis, with which Londoners are already
familiar - they were first launched in the early 1980s - have been
substantially re-engineered with an eye to export markets, and 50 are
destined for Australia. 'We're already up to 16 a week since production
restarted in January (with 15 workers),' says Thurlow.
An accountant by training - his 'school', like so many UK motor industry
men, was Ford - Thurlow will have as Metrocab's chairman Paul Crowder,
managing director of the Hooper group as a whole. But with Thurlow settled
at the wheel, Crowder is now ready for some back-seat thinking about the
strategic development of the group.
*****
One of Michael Heseltine's first actions on becoming President of the Board
of Trade was to appoint two deputy chairmen to BRITISH COAL - which he will
be in charge of privatising before long.
He has nominated Ken Moses and Albert Wheeler, both lifelong coal men.
Moses, 60, has worked his way up from the bottom. He worked underground in
the Lancashire pits, rising through the company to become strategic planning
director, and earning a doctorate from Nottingham University in 1990.
Wheeler came up through the Scottish and Midlands coal industry and is now
in charge of mining operations.
*****
Billy Kane, md of WOODCHESTER UK, is leaving to return to Ireland. John
McQuaid, head of corporate planning at GPA, is to become group treasury
director of Woodchester Investments.
*****
Ove Sorenson, former president and chief executive officer of Grand
Metropolitan's Haagen-Dazs ice-cream company, is joining United Distillers,
the Guinness spirits subsidiary, as president and ceo of its North American
operations.
He takes over from Phil Parnell who becomes regional managing director,
United Distillers Europe.
Danish-born Sorenson, who has lived in the US for the past 12 years, has
overseen the worldwide growth of the Haagen-Dazs brand of premium ice-cream
since the GrandMet takeover in 1989. Before that, he held senior marketing
and sales positions with Pepsico and Mars.
The moves complete UD's new senior management team under Crispin Davis, who
next month takes over as UD managing director from Tony Greener on his
appointment as chief executive of Guinness.
*****
Jim Nelson, president of Arbor Acres Farm, BOOKER's US subsidiary, has been
appointed to the main board; Angus McKenzie is retiring following the
disposal of the company's health products interests.
*****
BASS, the brewing, hotels and leisure group, has reshuffled the
responsibilities of its executive directors.
Peter Sherlock, present chief executive of Bass Leisure, will become
president of hotel operations, Holiday Inn Worldwide. He will be responsible
for owned and managed hotels in North America, and all Holiday Inn business
in Europe, the Middle East, and Africa.
Charles Darby will head the group's UK retailing and leisure interests as
chairman of Bass Taverns and executive chairman of Bass Leisure.
Jimmy Angles, md of Britvic, will succeed Darby as chief executive of Bass
Taverns; and Stephen Davies will take over the Britvic post.
*****
Bryan Sanderson (above), chief executive of BP Chemicals, has been appointed
a managing director and to the board of BP.

<TEXT>
With women setting up in business at a faster rate than men, it is perhaps
fitting that Britain's new small firms minister is a woman, Baroness Denton
of Wakefield.
Baroness Denton, aged 56, has for the past five years been deputy chairman
of the Black Country Development Corporation, a job which exposed her to the
problems of small businesses. She has also held a number of company
directorships, and spent three years from 1969 to 1972 as a professional
racing and rally driver.
The appointment coincides with moving small firms from the Department of
Employment back to the Department of Trade and Industry. Small firms groups
hope that under a more interventionist minister in the shape of Michael
Heseltine the government may undertake a more active small firms policy.
The DTI ministerial team possesses unrivalled small firms experience in the
shape of Tim Eggar, a former small firms minister, and Neil Hamilton, vice
chairman of the Small Business Bureau and a keen supporter of small business
causes.
Small business groups are concerned about the breadth of Baroness Denton's
responsibilities, which include industry, the environment and (within the
department) equal opportunities issues. A second worry is the enthusiasm
which Michael Heseltine has expressed for the continental European model of
statutory chambers of commerce.

FT  21 APR 92 / Management: Small firms stick to their own kind
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Most small businesses are not as well integrated into strong local networks
of contacts as many people generally assume. They are far more likely to
have good connections with other businesses in their own sector of industry
or commerce, regardless of geographical location, according to a survey* by
Kingston Polytechnic, writes Charles Batchelor.
The survey, commissioned by Midland Bank, has implications not only for the
way banks sell their services to the small business community, but also for
the way other providers of advice and assistance approach this market. Both
enterprise agencies and the more recently established Training and
Enterprise Councils have problems reaching their local business communities.
Contacts between small businesses and large local companies and public
sector organisations are not particularly strong, the survey notes. Many
large organisations do not stress local businesses in their purchasing
policies.
Neither small nor large businesses participate to any great extent in their
local community or economy. Large companies which join their local chamber
of commerce or other local bodies often do so out of a sense of noblesse
oblige rather than any serious commitment.
Most small business owners do not belong to any extensive local network of
connections but maintain single relations with other businesses like spokes
in a wheel with some of the 'spokes' reaching well beyond the local economy,
the researchers say.
Businesses are more likely to be linked with their counterparts in the same
sector through trade associations, trade magazines, supplier networks, trade
exhibitions and other groupings, the survey says. Sector-based networks are
particularly well developed in industries such as car manufacture where
large manufacturers depend on a wide range of components suppliers, and in
long-established sectors such as the pub trade.
Other, newer industries such as electronics and computer services do not
have such high levels of trade association membership, however.
The weakness of the local business network mirrors a decline in community
life generally over the past 20 years and the ferocity of the past two
recessions which have disturbed established economic patterns, the Kingston
researchers conclude.
Traditional industries have declined and the emergence of new service
industries has destroyed many of the local webs of economic life, they say.

FT  21 APR 92 / Economics: Attention moves to trade figures in search for
clear signs of recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER, Economics staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WITH the UK election out of the way, the race to spot clear signs of
economic recovery is on.
The evidence so far has been patchy. Last week's figures were contradictory
 -manufacturing output rose in March while the rise in unemployment eased,
but the Confederation of British Industry's survey of distributive trades
showed retail sales falling in February.
Two sets of figures this week will therefore be closely scrutinised.
On Friday the Central Statistical Office publishes figures for retail sales
in March and trade figures for the same month. In spite of a recession and
an upward trend in exports, the underlying UK trade deficit is still high,
at around Pounds 1bn on a monthly basis.
Mr Neil MacKinnon, chief European economist at Yamaichi, the Japanese
securities house, says: 'To run a trade deficit when the economy is in
recession suggests that there are acute structural problems. Moreover, as
the economic recovery moves on to a firmer footing, the trade deficit is set
to deteriorate sharply.'
Another fear is that with 57 per cent of Britain's exports going to the
European Community, a downturn in economic activity elsewhere in Europe will
hurt British exporters.
In Germany, with March marking the peak of West German inflation, April's
cost of living figures should show a deceleration in the annual rate to 4.7
per cent. According to Midland Montagu Research, inflation in the second
quarter is likely to average around 4.5 per cent. It predicts that from now
on, both headline and underlying inflation should decline through 1992.
German M3 data are also released this week. The M3 figure continues to grow
outside its target range of 3.5-5.5 per cent a year, slowing only slightly
in February to 8.5 per cent. March is expected to show a marginal
deceleration in the annual growth to about 8 per cent.
Highlights of the week ahead, with median forecasts in brackets from MMS
International, a financial information company, include:
Today: US, March Treasury budget; France, February industrial production (up
0.4 per cent); Denmark, March consumer price index (up 0.2 per cent on
month, up 2.4 per cent on year); Canada, February retail sales (down 0.3 per
cent).
Tomorrow: US, International Monetary Fund spring meetings (until April 28),
Jacques Delors, European Community President meets President Bush; UK, March
M0 (up 0.1 per cent on month, up 2.3 per cent on year), March M4 (up 0.6 per
cent on month, up 6.1 per cent on year), March M4 lending (Pounds 1.5bn);
Canada, February wholesale trade (up 0.5 per cent), February department
store sales (up 0.2 per cent).
Thursday: Germany, regular Bundesbank council meeting; UK, British Chambers
of Commerce quarterly economic survey published; US, April 11-20 car sales
(6m), March durable goods orders (up 1.3 per cent), March durable shipments,
initial claims for week ended April 11, Money supply data for week ended
April 13; Japan, February personal consumption expenditure, February
personal income; Australia, February manufacturing output and input prices.
Friday: Sweden, 1991/92 government supplementary budget request; US,
first-quarter housing vacancies, March bank credit, March commercial and
industrial loans; UK, March retail sales (flat on month, down 2.1 per cent
on year), March visible trade deficit (Pounds 900m), March current account
deficit (Pounds 600m); France, March trade deficit (FFr250m).
During the week: Germany, producer prices index (up 0.3 per cent on month,
up 2.5 per cent on year), March M3 from fourth-quarter base (up 8 per cent),
preliminary figures for April cost of living (up 0.3 per cent on month, up
4.7 per cent on year), March import prices (up 0.4 per cent on month, down
1.1 per cent on year; Holland, March unemployment.

FT  21 APR 92 / The Week Ahead: Results due
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
SmithKline Beecham, the Anglo-American pharmaceuticals and consumer products
group, reports its first-quarter results on Thursday. Analysts expect
pre-tax profits to increase about 9 per cent from Pounds 253m last year to
about Pounds 278m.
Underlying growth, excluding currency effects caused by the strong dollar,
will be about 4 per cent, with the pharmaceuticals operations
underperforming that figure.
The small improvement at the pharmaceutical division is because sales of
Tagamet, its anti-ulcer drug, are likely to be static. In addition, the
benefits of the company's new drugs will not yet have worked their way
through, while marketing and sales costs will be high. A quarterly dividend
of about 4.2p per share is forecast compared with 3.75p last year.
Albert Fisher, the foods group, is expected to report on Thursday a drop in
pre-tax profits for the six months to end February to about Pounds 37m from
Pounds 45m a year earlier. The dividend could be raised marginally to 1.80p
(1.75p).
The stock has virtually halved over the past year to 72p, a drop the company
called last December 'wholly unjustified'. A hot favourite in the 1980s bull
market, the stock has been knocked by concerns over weakening markets for
some of its products.
Two particular worries are the extent of the slowdown in its North American
food service operations and problems with its Dutch shellfish business.
Wace, the pre-press printing group, will report tomorrow a decline in
profits after five years of spectacular growth. Pre-tax profits will be
around Pounds 16m-Pounds 18m for 1991 against Pounds 26.5m in 1990 and a
mere Pounds 640,000 back in 1986.
The fall reflects recession in the printing business, not any circumstances
connected to the dramatic resignation on January 31 of Mr John Clegg, the
young entrepreneur who built up the company. The Department of Trade and
Industry is investigating potentially unlawful dealing in shares of two
companies Wace acquired or considered acquiring. He denies any involvement.

FT  21 APR 92 / Signs of recovery seen in N England
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY, Northern Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STATISTICAL evidence for recovery has emerged in northern England. Kirklees
and Wakefield chamber of commerce and industry, which covers West Yorkshire
south of the M62, says many local indicators of economic performance are now
at their best for 24 months.
The chamber, which surveys a representative sample of 120 companies each
quarter, says sales and orders started rising again in the first quarter of
the year. The indications, it says, suggest a sluggish recovery. Levels of
trade are only back where they were when recession began to affect the north
in 1990.
Nevertheless, the chamber's quarterly survey shows the first positive
balance figures - the difference between the proportion of companies
reporting rises and falls in sales and orders - since the recession began.
Quarterly comparison of balance figures for domestic deliveries gives the
local trend. It was minus 48 percentage points in the first quarter of last
year, minus 31 points in the second and third quarters, and minus 18 points
in October-December. The latest survey shows plus 5 percentage points for
the first quarter this year - 33 per cent reported rises and 28 per cent
falls.
Domestic orders show a positive balance of 10 per cent after four negative
quarters last year. Since the balance for orders was minus 16 per cent in
the fourth quarter of last year and deliveries have suddenly speeded up so
far this year, it suggests that orders have shot up only in recent months
and businesses have been able to fill them quickly.
The test of whether this really is the beginning of recovery, rather than
industrial customers replenishing depleted stocks on a just-in-time basis,
will start to show only at the end of the current quarter, when more
statistics become available.
The Kirklees chamber survey also shows small positive balance figures for
exports deliveries and orders. The effect on confidence has been immediate,
with positive balances for investment in buildings, plant and machinery.

FT  21 APR 92 / Chambers report idle plant capacity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEARLY 80 per cent of companies in the East Midlands, one of the most
economically diversified regions of the UK, worked at less than full
capacity during the first quarter of this year, according to the latest
business survey of the region's Chambers of Commerce.
The results of the survey, carried out in March and covering 336 companies,
provide scant evidence of any recovery from recession.
The number of companies with under-used capacity has remained fairly
constant since 1990. There is little in the flow of orders to suggest any
immediate change.
At 31 per cent, the proportion of companies with larger domestic order books
is lower than either last December, at 35 per cent, or last September at 33
per cent.
Although 31 per cent of companies received more export orders during the
first quarter, that proportion is only slightly higher than that recorded
last September and lower than the values recorded last June.
Although most East Midlands companies expect an improvement in turnover and
profitability, 80 per cent found that over the past three months their cash
flow either remained the same or deteriorated.
Equally, the chambers' survey suggests, most companies have no plans to
increase their investment.
The main financial preoccupation of business remains, as it has done since
1990, the high level of interest rates. Most analysts believe there is
little immediate prospect of lower rates.

FT  21 APR 92 / Funds sought for new university
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LINCOLNSHIRE County Council plans to seek up to Pounds 30m of private-sector
funding to establish a new university in Lincoln. The institution will be
developed by either Nottingham University or Nottingham Polytechnic.
Mr Arthur Ridings, the council's director of education, said that four
consultancies had been asked to tender for a contract 'to identify potential
commercial, industrial and community partners for the university
initiative'.
Both the university and the polytechnic have estimated that it would take
Pounds 30m to establish the new university. The council wants the maximum
possible private funding, but the consultants will also be expected to
advise on the use of the money markets to make up any shortfall.
The report is expected by the end of May, and the council will choose its
academic partner by the end of July. The most likely approach is to
transform one of the county's higher-education colleges into a university
college and then to expand that into a university by the end of the decade.

<TEXT>
A Muscovite fills his car as long queues formed at petrol stations in Moscow
yesterday. Disgruntled drivers paid five times as much to fill their cars
with petrol, Reuter reports. As part of President Boris Yeltsin's economic
reform programme, the price rose from 5 pence a gallon to 27p.
'It's becoming impossible to drive in this country,' said Mr Konstantin
Milyukov, an engineer, sitting in a grimy red Zhiguli sedan in a line of
cars blocking a street near the city's Sokolniki Park.
Russians, accustomed to hoarding scarce commodities from soap to sugar, have
known for weeks that a petrol price rise was on the cards and many have
stashed away enough fuel to keep them on the road for weeks. But some were
caught unawares by the timing of the price rise.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Russian congress, the Communist-dominated parliament that last week
refused to recognise the Soviet collapse, yesterday acknowledged
establishment of the Commonwealth of Independent States, AP reports from
Moscow.
On a vote of 548-158 the Congress of People's Deputies adopted a resolution
affirming Russia's membership in the commonwealth, which was created last
December.
The vote was a victory for President Boris Yeltsin, who has encountered
stiff opposition from lawmakers hostile to his market reforms, his sweeping
powers and his efforts to co-operate with other former Soviet republics
within the new commonwealth.
In a largely symbolic protest vote on Friday, the congress refused to
recognise the Soviet collapse or accept responsibility for fulfilling arms
control and other treaties signed by the former Soviet government.
Yesterday the lawmakers reversed themselves, accepting the commonwealth as a
'new legal and political form of voluntary union among sovereign states'.
The decision by the Russian parliament is unlikely, however, to defuse
tensions with other former Soviet republics. President Leonid Kravchuk of
Ukraine yesterday raised the stakes in a territorial dispute with Russia by
warning that a proposed referendum on Crimean independence could lead to
tragedy and bloodshed, Reuter reports from Kiev.
'A referendum is the tragic path towards a schism in the Crimea. And what
that schism would bring, what misfortunes it would cause for the people of
the peninsula and others besides, no one may dare to predict,' Mr Kravchuk
said.
'I should like to utter a serious warning: if the political process
continues to develop in that direction, then there can be no guarantee that
events in Crimea will not lurch out of control and that human blood will not
be spilled.'
The Black Sea peninsula of Crimea was handed from Russia to Ukraine in 1954
as a gift to mark 300 years of union between the two Slav neighbours. Since
the breakup of the union last year some Russian parliamentarians have
questioned the legality of the transfer, raising Ukrainian fears that Moscow
could try to claim the territory back.
Russian foreign minister Andrei Kozyrev rebuked conservatives in the Russian
parliament last Saturday for raising territorial claims against Ukraine,
saying these could disrupt international arms agreements. But he said Russia
would take a hard line on the Crimea and other issues if Ukraine tried to
leave the CIS.
The pro-independence Republican Movement of Crimea (RDK) has gathered a
petition with more than 246,000 signatures in an attempt to force a
referendum on breaking away from Ukraine.
The parliament of Crimea, whose 2.5m people are mostly ethnic Russians, is
due to meet on May 5 to debate the holding of the referendum. Ukraine's
parliament is empowered to ban the plebiscite if it judges it to violate the
country's constitution.
President Kravchuk said separation from Ukraine would spell economic
disaster and damage the living standards of Crimeans. He said Ukraine
favoured development of a free economic zone in Crimea and had allocated
more than 4bn roubles this year to address problems of energy and water
supply, ethnic relations and 'social defence' of the poor and pensioners.

FT  21 APR 92 / 'Hard-as-nails' finance policy pledged by Waigel
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
WEST Germany may face four years of belt-tightening to pay the bills for
unification with the east, Mr Theo Waigel, finance minister, warned at the
weekend.
'Increases in national spending must be kept far below rises in economic
output. . . Federal outgoings should rise only 2.5 per cent annually over
the next four years. State and local authority expenditure should not go up
more than 3 per cent,' he said.
The difference between these limits and expected nominal economic growth of
up to 7 per cent a year would cover about 80 per cent of unification costs,
the minister claimed. Latest estimates suggest that west-east transfers this
year, mainly for social and welfare benefits, will reach DM155bn (Pounds
53.2bn).
Promising a 'hard-as-nails finance policy' to back his programme, he said
there would be no increases in spending commitments without cuts elsewhere.
The government would not take on any new spending obligations until 1996.
Although the planned moratorium could mean 'cuts for the citizens', his
scheme was designed to restructure the welfare system, not to destroy it, he
said. In the meantime, he added: 'I will do everything to avoid tax
increases.'
Mr Waigel's declaration, which he claimed had the support of Chancellor
Helmut Kohl, is an attempt to seize the high ground for the relatively
hardline policies of the senior Christian Democrat/Christian Social Union
coalition partners in talks expected soon with the opposition Social
Democrats (SPD).
After shock gains by far-right parties in state elections earlier this
month, Mr Kohl invited SPD leaders to talks after Easter to discuss economic
and constitutional reform.
The minister's proposals are unlikely to have an easy passage. Objections
can even be expected from the liberal Free Democrats, the junior coalition
party, which is stoutly against any interference with welfare benefits. The
SPD, meanwhile, has recognised that the burdens of unification have left the
government with little room for manoeuvre.
Mr Waigel, interviewed in Die Welt, said not everyone yet realised that a
part of western economic growth had to be set aside for the east.
Underlining the urgency of the need for economies, he ruled out federal
funding for projects such as the Olympic games in 2000, for which Berlin is
a leading bidder, and the next world Expo exhibition, planned for Hanover.
He also reinforced Bonn's pleadings for a fairer division of the costs of
supporting reconstruction in the former Soviet Union. It would be a priority
topic at the G7 summit in Munich during July, he said. 'My pockets are sewn
shut.'

FT  21 APR 92 / The European Market: Data protection raises EC hackles -
Many organisations and businesses have been frightened by a draft directive
designed to ease the cross-frontier flow of information
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OCCASIONALLY the European Commission produces draft legislation which makes
even Brussels' hardened lobbyists rub their hands at the prospect of new
accounts and fat fees. The data protection directive - published in
September 1990 - is just such a measure.
So far the directive has frightened charities, direct marketing companies,
airlines, banks, trade unions, human rights groups and the media.
More than 150 amendments were submitted by MEPs at its first reading in the
European Parliament's February session, many inspired by the gripes of
specific industries. When it came to the vote last month, 131 of those
changes were adopted.
The Commission, which hopes to win member states' approval for the measure
before the end of this year, is now wondering which amendments it should
incorporate into a revised draft.
The directive is intended to ease the cross-frontier flow of information,
much of it computerised, by harmonising national data protection laws. It
also extends the scope of some national legislation from computerised to
manual data - although officials claim it is not intended to regulate the
contents of every filing cabinet in Europe.
Without a harmonising measure, Brussels argues, countries with a relatively
high level of protection - such as Britain or Germany - would restrict data
transmission to their less well protected EC partners on the grounds that it
could be misused.
But many argue that the Commission's original draft set unduly high
standards, putting its second aim - protection of the individual - above the
need to ensure an open market.
The parliament seemed to agree. The broad thrust of its amendments last
month was to relax the directive's restrictions in the private sector.
To take one example, the original draft requires the express consent of
'data subjects' before information about them can be communicated or
processed. There are exceptions: publicly available information, for
example, and 'contractual or quasi-contractual relationships', such as with
one's bank or mortgage-broker.
But the parliament's amendments would go further and introduce an element of
'implicit' consent. They would also exempt the media from the measure, thus
meeting investigative journalists' concerns that the need to inform data
subjects about files might make their jobs impossible. In addition,
companies would be able to give customers the option to object to further
processing and communication of personal data. This is the 'opt-out' clause
favoured by direct marketers, who, as voracious data-users, are among the
most vociferous critics of the legislation.
But though apparently sympathetic to the often exaggerated problems of
individual sectors, the Commission sees little need to distort what it
believes should be a broad and coherent framework directive with nit-picking
amendments. So a complete exemption of the media would be 'excessive', in
the words of one official, and specific rules on direct marketing would come
'at a different stage'.
Officials point out that, in its first published draft, the directive
mentions no specific sectors, allows member states much scope in the
application of the measure, and provides for follow-up committees to
fine-tune the legislation and make further recommendations.
This solution itself worries the critics, who fear that committees made up
of national officials and hardline data protection commissioners would be
unable to resist tightening the measure. Parliament is pressing for such
advisory committees to include representatives of other interest groups.
'Certainly there will be a follow-up (to the directive),' says one
Commission official in defence of the proposed system. 'What I'm contesting
is that this follow-up will necessarily be restrictive. It will represent a
fair compromise between the different interests involved in Europe.'
There will have to be more than one compromise. Criticised for being too
restrictive in the private sector, Brussels is also under attack for
allowing public authorities too much leeway to do what they want with
personal data.
'There are extremely strict rules on the private sector, but it has
basically become a data-abusers' charter in the public sector,' warns Mr
Douwe Korff, a UK-based human rights lawyer who also represents Amnesty
International.
If parliament's amendments are adopted, Mr Korff believes they could
undermine the directive's principal aim of establishing a level EC playing
field in data protection, and create constitutional problems by overriding
stricter human rights legislation in some member states.
Most critics acknowledge that the Commission - perhaps without realising the
scale of the task at the outset - will have to face up to some tough
problems, not to mention some ruthless lobbying, before the data protection
directive is approved by member states. But, as Mr Korff points out, that is
what legislators are paid for.

AFTER spending weeks trying and failing to find a rescuer for La Cinq, the

now searching for a new station to take La Cinq's place as France's fifth

On Friday the Conseil Superieur de l'Audiovisuel, the watchdog for French
broadcasting, will begin a formal inquest into the collapse of La Cinq,
which filed for bankruptcy on New Year's Eve and was taken off air a week
ago.
After the inquest the CSA will decide what sort of station should replace La
Cinq, and will advertise at the end of June for candidates.
There is no shortage of suitable candidates. Long before La Cinq had gone
off air, a stream of would-be successors presented plans to fill the fifth
channel.
TF1 teamed up with M6 and Canal Plus, two other French stations, to table
proposals for a current affairs channel while the French government has
floated plans to launch ARTE, an Anglo-German cultural channel.

FT  21 APR 92 / Hurd visit aimed at reassuring Turkey on EC
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT MAUTHNER and JOHN MURRAY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, ANKARA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH foreign secretary Douglas Hurd begins a two-day visit to Turkey
today aimed at reassuring the country's leaders that Britain and its
European Community partners continue to regard it as a valued ally, in spite
of recent tensions in some of their relations.
While it is generally agreed in the Community that Turkey cannot be part of
the next wave of new EC entrants, Mr Hurd is known to feel that Ankara has
been getting a raw deal from the EC, with which it has had a long-standing
association agreement.
Britain is anxious that Turkey should be treated equally in the EC's
proposed Mediterranean arrangements and that the Community's fourth
financial protocol for Turkey should also be unblocked.
Both these measures, which could enhance Turkey's relationship with the EC,
short of full membership, are currently being held up by Greek objections.
Mr Hurd, who is due to meet both President Turgut Ozal and Mr Suleyman
Demirel, prime minister, will also discuss the obstacles which have arisen
in talks on Turkey's association with the nine-nation Western European Union
defence organisation.
Under last year's Maastricht Treaty, Greece, a member of the EC, was offered
full membership of WEU, while Turkey was offered only association.
The main problem is how article 5 of the WEU treaty, which says an attack on
one member country should be considered as an attack on all members, will
apply to Greece and Turkey, given their historically hostile relations.
The proposed solution is a formula which will make clear that the article in
question cannot be invoked in the event of hostilities between two member
countries.
Though Britain is anxious not to get involved in Turkey's problems with its
Kurdish population, Mr Hurd will hardly be able to avoid discussions of the
Kurdish problem. The UK, together with other anti-Iraq coalition powers, is
expected to seek permission to extend Operation Provide Comfort, the
security umbrella for the Iraqi Kurds provided by allied aircraft flying out
of the joint US-Turkish airbase at Incirlik in south Turkey.
The current six-month agreement expires on June 28. An extension may prove
difficult, because Mr Demirel has said any decision must be taken by
parliament, whereas previous extensions were decided by government decree.

FT  21 APR 92 / Keating takes tightrope walk to Indonesia: The Australian
prime minister's first official overseas trip
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN and WILLIAM KEELING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Paul Keating, Australia's prime minister, arrives in Jakarta today on his
first official overseas trip, hoping to promote trade links and cement
relations with Australia's increasingly prosperous northern neighbour. To do
so, he will have to walk a tightrope between two cultures - showing
sufficient concern about human rights to satisfy voluble domestic critics,
while avoiding an embarrassing rupture with President Suharto, his sometimes
volatile host.
Evidence of the inherent difficulties appeared at the weekend in the shape
of wooden crosses planted outside Indonesia's Canberra embassy, in memory of
124 East Timorese allegedly killed by Indonesian troops in November. The
crosses are deeply embarrassing to the Australian government, which obtained
a court order to end a similar demonstration in January, and later changed
the law to try to prevent a repetition. But the demonstration reflects
continued public concern about Indonesia's treatment of minorities,
especially in East Timor, a former Portuguese colony annexed in 1976, and
Irian Jaya, formerly Dutch New Guinea.
To Mr Keating's discomfort, it also highlights a contrast between
Australia's tradition of robust public debate and the government's desire
not to irritate President Suharto, who came to power in 1967. Indonesia is
notoriously touchy about foreign criticism of its internal affairs,
especially from Australia. In 1986, for example, bilateral relations were
frozen after the Sydney Morning Herald suggested the president's family was
involved in corrupt business dealings.
However, the relationship has improved significantly in the last five years,
partly because of a close personal friendship between Senator Gareth Evans,
the Australian foreign minister, and Ali Alatas, his Indonesian counterpart.
The two countries worked together closely in the development of Australian
proposals which formed the basis of the United Nations peace plan being
implemented in Cambodia.
Indonesia also helped overcome regional suspicion, notably in Malaysia, of
the Asia Pacific Economic Co-operation (Apec) process launched by Mr Bob
Hawke, the former Australian prime minister.
Possibly the most important breakthrough came last year, when the two
countries signed an agreement allowing oil exploration and production in
disputed areas of the Timor Sea.
Several Australian states have also developed contacts with Indonesian
provinces, and Mrs Carmen Lawrence, premier of Western Australia, will be in
Surabaya on Thursday when Mr Keating opens a state government office there.
Much of the increased interest in Indonesia is being driven by Canberra's
attempts to carve out an Asian future for Australia, in deference to
geographic realities and the waning of traditional links with Europe.
Australians are also waking up to the material progress being made by
Indonesia, which achieved annual economic growth of more than 6 per cent
through most of the 1980s, and now boasts GDP of USDollars 100bn (Pounds
56.4bn), which is more than a third of the Australian level.
So far Australian exports have been largely restricted to commodities such
as oil, wheat and cotton, while Indonesia sells petroleum products, textiles
and oil to Australia. But bilateral trade surged by 27 per cent to USDollars
2.3bn last year, making Indonesia Australia's ninth largest trading partner.
Aggregate Australian investment in Indonesia totals about ADollars 1bn, but
most is focused on a handful of mining projects. Mr Philip Flood, the
Australian ambassador to Jakarta, admits that Indonesia's potential is not
sufficiently well known in Australia. Mr Keating will try to redress that
problem by stressing the progress which has been made in negotiations on
putative agreements on double taxation, fisheries co-operation and
investment regulations.
But his main concern will be to try to build on evidence that Indonesia's
political culture is maturing sufficiently to allow its relationship with
Canberra to withstand the shock of events such as the massacre in East
Timor.
Jakarta has responded with noticeable restraint to Australian criticism of
the shootings, and the Indonesian military reacted cautiously last month to
attempts by a 'peace boat', carrying demonstrators, media and politicians,
to sail from Darwin to East Timor without permission.
Australia has sought to play down the massacre by focusing on Indonesia's
'credible' establishment of a government inquiry which concluded that 50
people had died, rather than 19, as the army claimed. Canberra's view is
that the report shows the massacre did not happen as a result of government
policy - a formula which will allow Mr Keating to deprecate the killings
without being forced to endorse domestic criticism of the Indonesian
government.
Mr Keating has made clear, for example, that he will resist pressure from
the Australian Council for Overseas Aid to seek Indonesian pledges on human
rights in return for Australian aid, which last year totalled ADollars 114m.
Officials say the prime minister has taken to heart advice from Mr Richard
Woolcott, the recently retired head of the foreign affairs department, to
avoid annoying the Indonesians with 'excessive self-righteous moralising'.
Mr Woolcott, one of the architects of Australia's Asian policy, warned
recently that nothing annoys Asian leaders more than interference in their
domestic affairs by Australia, which many regard as 'uncouth, lazy,
self-satisfied and unwilling to make the effort to understand them and their
societies'.
Mr Keating's difficult task will be helped by President Suharto's pleasure
in his choice of Jakarta for his first foreign trip, rather than the more
traditional destinations of London or Washington - a decision which also
underlines the changing priorities of Australia.
Nevertheless, he will have to perform a delicate balancing act if he is to
leave Indonesia on Thursday with both the bilateral relationship and his
domestic reputation intact.

FT  21 APR 92 / Israel reopens Bir Zeit University after four years

<TEXT>
ISRAEL yesterday announced the reopening of Bir Zeit University, the most
prestigious university in the occupied territories.
It has been closed for more than four years, under one of the most
criticised measures imposed by the authorities to combat the Palestinian
intifada, or uprising.
The first official classes for the 2,500 students will be held on April 29,
two days after the fifth round of Arab-Israeli negotiations launched at last
year's Madrid peace conference gets under way in Washington.
The US has led persistent international criticism of the Israeli policy of
closing Palestinian schools and colleges, saying that it amounted to
unwarranted collective punishment.
Over the past two years, as levels of violence have subsided, all schools
and most higher education institutions in the West Bank and Gaza Strip have
been reopened, leaving only Bir Zeit still shut.
Bir Zeit, near Ramallah, north of Jerusalem, has been a centre of
Palestinian nationalism as well as building a reputation for the highest
academic standards among the six small universities established during the
occupation.
Several senior members of the Palestinian team involved in the peace talks,
including Mrs Hanan Ashrawi, the spokeswoman, teach at Bir Zeit.
Unofficial classes were held off-campus during the closure, but staff
members say these were inevitably inadequate for full completion of courses.

FT  21 APR 92 / Chicago's reputation washed away: 'City that works' pays for
its budget shortcuts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARBARA DURR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CATASTROPHIC flooding of downtown Chicago last week, after an underground
tunnel burst, did not dampen the city's die-hard commercial instincts.
Within days, T-shirts marking the event were being sold and retailers able
to open their doors were using the calamity to lure in customers with 'flood
sales'.
While the crisis is not over - clearing the flood waters will take at least
another 10 days - the initial sense of panic has evaporated. The continuing
inconveniences, such as reduced public transport and restricted parking,
barely ruffle Chicagoans, whose stoicism in coping with the city's harsh
weather is almost limitless. But the flood has been crushing for business.
The inventories of many downtown retailers floated for several days in their
basements and electrical power and telephone service are still cut in some
office buildings.
The Chicago Board of Trade, the world's largest futures market, has managed
to create an emergency electrical hook-up, partly using its own generators,
but it could not hold a full trading session yesterday.
A full session is planned for today, but the CBOT will have to fly the
records of each day's trades to an office in the Chicago suburbs for
processing. It hopes a reliable electricity supply will be restored by next
Monday.
The Chicagoland Chamber of Commerce estimates that lost sales and clean-up
expenses have already cost businesses Dollars 1bn (Pounds 570m), before
infrastructural damage is taken into account.
A temporary office to dispense federal government disaster relief has been
taking applications from businesses since Friday. A handful of older
buildings may never be able to reopen as it is suspected their foundations
have been permanently damaged.
The city, too, has been knocked hard; its mass transit department is
estimating it will take Dollars 20m (Pounds 11.2m) to repair subways, into
which water leaked from the flooded tunnel.
Extra police, firemen and other services have cranked up expenses for an
already strained budget. And the bill for plugging the tunnel hole and
clearing the flood waters is expected to run close to Dollars 1bn, which the
city does not have.
Trying to put the best face on things, Mayor Richard Daley is asserting that
the city can still lay claim to its fame as 'the city that works'.
But the statement rings hollow in the wake of evidence that foot-dragging
and penny-pinching by city bureaucrats may have led to the calamity.
The roots of the problem go back to last September. The company that
installed pilings to protect a bridge over the river from passing barges
allegedly did not comply with the terms of its contract.
It was to remove the old pilings and place new ones in the same locations,
because of underground 'structures'.
Instead, the company did not remove the old pilings and drove the new ones
into the riverbed in such a way as to crush the tunnel's wall.
The company says it was given oral permission to sidestep the contract's
terms by city officials.
Despite being informed of a resultant slow leak in the tunnel three months
ago, public works officials dithered over bids to conduct the repair as they
exceeded the city's own estimate of Dollars 10,000.
Last week the leak burst into a car-sized hole, pouring more than 250m
gallons of the Chicago River into the city's turn-of-the-century coal tunnel
system and downtown building basements.
The mayor has sacked one department chief and some dozen more heads are
expected to roll.
Ironically, Mr Daley himself, instead of being held responsible for the
crisis, has won considerable public approval for the way he has handled it.
This is a tribute not only to how tirelessly the mayor has worked to resolve
the problem, but to his formidable public relations machine which went into
overdrive to point the finger at lesser officials.
Some have suggested the Chicago disaster is a harbinger of what is ahead for
many US cities, whose ageing infrastructure is deteriorating and whose
budgets, teetering near or in the red, cannot be stretched.
Prof Clark Barrett, an expert on urban infrastructure at the Illinois
Institute of Technology, said: 'Cities play on the margins of safety.
There's no reward for fixing things.' Or as one Chicago resident watching
efforts to plug the tunnel's hole put it: 'The politicians ain't gonna spend
money that nobody can see.'

FT  21 APR 92 / Pressure grows on unions to ballot for Labour leader
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART and RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRESSURE intensified yesterday on Labour-affiliated trade unions to ballot
members before voting in the party's leadership contest, as the two main
contenders clashed over tax policy.
Amid signs that Labour's links with the unions could be changed irrevocably
by the contest, Mr Bryan Gould, shadow environment spokesman, who is
standing for the party leadership, said the winner's credibility could be
undermined if he was 'not seen to be legitimately elected'.
Senior Labour figures are privately dismayed by the high profile of the
unions in the contest and by some union leaders' dismissive attitude to
ballots on the leadership issue. Unions hold 40 per cent of the vote in
Labour's electoral college. The GMB general union is the only large union to
have said it will hold a workplace ballot but it may be joined by the TGWU
general union. The executive of the AEU engineering union said it will not
hold a ballot, citing time problems and cost. It may be forced to change its
position at the union's national conference next week.
In spite of the relish which some union leaders are bringing to their old
power broking role in the Labour party, most agree that the links must be
loosened. Yesterday, Mr John Edmonds, leader of the GMB, said the unions
should have no votes in the electoral college and the block vote at Labour's
conference should be radically cut.
Lobbying for support at the Scottish Trades Union Congress meeting in Perth,
Mr Gould said: 'The constitutional link cannot be broken but must be
democratised.' He backed a role for unions on Labour's national executive
committee and on the new policy-making forum.
Unions seem set to scale down their financial contributions to the Labour
party before any decision about scaling down their political involvement.
Adding to the tension over the contest, Mr John Smith, shadow chancellor and
favourite to win the leadership on July 18, launched a counter attack on Mr
Gould's criticism of Labour's redistributive tax policy. Speaking on behalf
of Mr Smith, Mr Robin Cook, Labour's health spokesman, said those who
questioned Labour's tax plans, as set out during the election, should state
the spending pledges they would drop.
Mr Gould, whose aides accused Mr Smith of becoming over defensive,
retaliated with further attacks on the shadow chancellor's Budget proposals.
Mr Gould denied opposing a redistributive tax system but said on BBC Radio,
'that begs the question of whether the precise package was as cleverly put
together as it might have been'. Labour's plans to abolish the ceiling on
National Insurance contributions and increase higher tax rates were 'seen to
be putting a cap on people's aspirations'.
Mr John Prescott, a candidate for deputy leader, attacked the clashes. He
said potential leaders had no right to set party policy.
A further sign of the disquiet within Labour ranks came in an attack on the
parliamentary party by Mr Barry Sheerman, home affairs spokesman. He accused
it of a 'dreadful inertia' and of failing to push for reform of either the
party or Parliament.

FT  18 APR 92 / Finance &amp; the Family: Experts lead by a nose
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PERHAPS IT pays to trust the experts.  Last July, we assembled four notional
share portfolios for private investors by four methods. Initially, the
portfolio chose by experts - analysts, fund managers and private client
stockbrokers - lagged in the race.  But during the last three months it has
pulled ahead.
The success is relative.  Even including dividend income and excluding
dealing costs, anyone investing in the experts' portfolio would be around 3
per cent down so far.  The FTA-A All-Share Index rose 2.2 per cent over the
same period, and that excludes any income.
Ove the last three months, the experts' portfolio has risen by almost 9 per
cent, helped by the post-election rally.  But six of the original 10 stock
selections have fallen in price since last July (Vodafone was split off from
the original selection of Racal, giving this portfolio 11 stocks).
The directors' portfolio, which led for the first six months, is now second.
 It was chosen by picking stocks where directors had previously bought
shares in unison.
This portfolio has a built-in handicap, in that the share price of a company
often moves immediately after news of a director purchase. Our portfolio was
thus bought after a price rise had occurred.  But private investors would
face the same handicap, so we thought this was a fair test of the strategy.
 A 5.4 per cent fall in the portfolio to date indicates that the system
still has a bit to prove.
In third place is the dart board portfolio, our 'control' for this
experiment.  The stocks were selected by throwing darts at the share price
pages of the FT.  This system was beating the experts after six months, but
has made little progress over the last three.  Were it not for the inclusing
of TVS Entertainment, however, it would be ahead. As it is, an investor
would have seen a 7.8 per cent loss to date.
Two adjustments have been made since July.  Precious Metals Trust was wound
up and was replaced by media group EMAP.  And Harrison Industries was the
subject of a reverse takeover by Antares, which resulted in a change in the
share capital of the group.
Still bottom of the pile, alas, is the high yield portfolio.  This was
selected by picking the stocks in the All-Share index witht he highest
yields.  A degree of safety was added by only choosing stocks where the
dividend was twice covered by earnings.
The risks and rewards of this are neatly illustrated.  Five of the stocks
show gains and the income from the portfolio is the best of the four.  But
three of the stocks, Ratners, Lep and TVS, have been disastrous, showing
losses of between 80 and 90 per cent.  The net effect has been a 9.7 per
cent loss.
There is no hope that an economic and stock market recovery might allow this
portfolio to recoup its losses.  Over the last three months, it has shown a
10 per cent gain.
What has the exercise shown so far?  First, that portfolio selections, and
outperforming a stock market index, is tricky.  Second, that the investor
cannot expect to make short term gains from equity investment. The proper
time ti judge these portfolios will be in five years.

Warning Talbot calculated head depth wrong READERS should note that this
week's tally of sales and purchases is considerably shorter than the
original version. The very high level of sales in particular caused us to
raise the dealing size threshold from Pounds 10,000 to Pounds 40,000.
Nevertheless, the column still provides an accurate reflection of the heavy
bias towards selling in the run-up to the general election. Given the result
however, next week may well see a sharp reversal in that trend.
Kevin McDonald, chairman of Polypipe, sold 4.8m shares at 86p in July last
year and was last week prompted to sell a further 1m shares at 113p.
Polypipe is one of the few building material companies to have weathered
this recession and the share price performance has certainly reflected that.
Shares in City Centre Restaurants, owners of the Garfunkels chain, have
almost doubled since the dark days of early 1990, but over that period
earnings have stood still. Phillip Kaye, the chief executive, has sold 2m
shares at 59.5p leaving himself with 6m shares.
The sale by Paul Ellis of 1,222,000 shares in Crown Communications arose
solely out of personal financial commitments.

FT  18 APR 92 / If God is the answer, what is the question?: The more
science discovers about the origin of the universe, the stranger the answers
become. Max Wilkinson discusses the latest theories and what they tell us
about the Creator
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAX WILKINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN THE beginning God created the laws which govern the heavens and the
earth. And the earth was without form and void. And the void was filled with
a ferment of particles appearing and disappearing in the darkness. And God
created quantum mechanics, relativity, quarks, and superstrings, each after
its kind.
And God said let there be light and there was a very Big Bang. . . .
THIS, or something like it, is how modern cosmologists would rewrite the
ancient text. And many would not delete the deity. Others, however, believe
that science will soon solve the greatest of all mysteries, without the need
for a Creator.
The debate is beginning to catch the imagination of a much wider public, as
works of popular science cascade from the presses, carrying strange messages
from distant galaxies and from the atom-smashing accelerators which
scientists use to investigate the smallest particles of matter. Some of
these, such as Stephen Hawking's challenging book, A Brief History of Time
(Bantam 1988) became best sellers.
The message of this new science is contradictory. Spectacular progress in
recent years suggests that the whole history of the universe might be
reduced to a set of equations, subsuming the laws of nature in a Theory of
Everything. This theory could not, of course, predict details such as 'the
fall of a sparrow', but God would no more be needed to run such a universe,
than we now think he is needed to explain storms and plagues. Yet the new
physics often generates more mysteries than the mystery it seeks to explain
 -for example it has time running backwards, particles in two places at once
and multiple universes. This is far different from the common sense world of
Newton and even Einstein.
Yet some scientists believe that the complexity of the world which modern
science reveals is itself an argument that God played an important part, as
opposed to a completely scientific explanation. In 1935 Albert Einstein
said: 'The most incomprehensible thing about the universe is that it is
comprehensible'. Paul Davies in The Mind of God (Simon and Schuster, 1992)
takes up this theme in the light of discoveries, which confirm even the
wierdest predictions of the new physics. Davies suggests that the mind of
man and the informing principles of the universe must have more than
something accidental in common. How otherwise could such strange complexity
be apparent to us? How else could scientists receive those flashes of
inspiration which reveal an unsuspected pattern? But Davies shows that a
scientifically literate believer will push God out of the driving seat. He
becomes a distant designer rather than the guiding hand.
Roger Penrose, the Oxford physicist, approaches the question in a rather
different way. The Emperor's New Mind (Oxford 1989), is an heroic, if
inconclusive, attempt to apply the new physics to the workings of the human
mind. He questions the mechanistic view that conscious thought can, like all
else, be explained by science. Thought may or may not show us to be us
godlike, as Descartes believed; but according to Penrose, it ain't just
physics.
In spite of the moderating influence of such scientists as Penrose and
Davies, popularisation of the grand claims of new science is provoking a
strong reaction. In this week's Spectator magazine, John Patten, the
education secretary, complains that science has weakened faith and thus
contributed to social malaise. The idea is developed in a polemical work by
Bryan Appleyard, Understanding the present - science and the soul of man
(Picador 1992), published this month. He asks whether the 'hollow,
mechanistic vision' of scientific writers such as Hawking 'will put us back
on the treadmill of eternal progress, reducing the span of our lives to
trivial, accidental interludes and removing our souls from our bodies.'
This is hardly more than a cri de coeur - and silly, because in spite of his
perceptive account of the development of modern science, Appleyard wilfully
confuses discovery, theory and scientific method in a crude personification
of science as an intellectual bully. His plea that science should somehow be
demoted and 'humanised' is absurd. For science discovers only truth.
Anything which is not true can be defeated by argument and experiment, and
if it cannot be so tested it is not science.
Yet Appleyard may have a point. As Richard Morris says in The Edge of
Science (Fourth Estate 1991) 'Scientists have been turning to questions that
were once asked only by philosophers'. What could be more arrogant than the
attempt to penetrate the secrets of creation. However, the Bible's 'In the
beginning' is now known to be about 15bn years ago, a large figure but only
the number of Pounds 1 coins which Exxon would need to buy Shell.
How do they know? Well, some sceptics agree with the title of Eric J.
Lerner's new book, The Big Bang never happened (Simon and Schuster 1992).
But most cosmologists are convinced big bangers. Edwin Hubble's discovery in
1929 that all galaxies are speeding away from each other was only
suggestive. But in 1964, Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson heard the Big Bang,
or at least its diminuendo, as short radio waves coming from all directions.
Why does it come from everywhere and not just from the place where the Big
Bang is supposed to have occurred? Simple] Because the Big Bang happened
everywhere. At that time the whole of space was shrunk to an infinitesimal
pinpoint. After the explosion, it inflated like a balloon, with all the
stars on the surface moving away from each other.
Yet despite the immense detail in which the Big Bang is now described, the
theory opens some acute difficulties, particularly the so called 'flatness
problem'. If the early universe had contained just the tiniest bit more
matter, the extra pull of gravity between the stars would long ago have
collapsed them all into a big crunch leaving not a wrack behind. On the
other hand, with just the tiniest bit less matter, gravity would not have
been strong enough to condense the primordial matter into stars, galaxies
and our nice comfortable solar system. So it seemed, on the face of it, that
the earth could have formed only as the result of a gigantic fluke - or
divine intervention. The US physicist, Alan Guth found a possible solution
in 1980, by the application of a Grand Unified Theory, combining three
elemental forces which were hitherto considered separate, but which may have
amalgamated in the primordial furnace.
At 1/1035 seconds after the start (1035 is 1 followed by 35 noughts) Guth
calculated, the universe would explode at an immensely accelerated rate,
increasing its size a trillion trillion trillion times in a microblink of
time. It did make the 'flatness' problem seem less coincidental. But the
theory is imperfect and the search continues. The latest idea of
'superstrings', for example, seeks to explain matter in terms of a tiny one
dimensional filaments existing in 10 dimensions, seven of which we could not
possibly see. Yet as Lawrence Kraus shows in The Fifth Essence (Hutchinson
Radius 1989), computers playing God with such theories and a toy Big Bang
can come up with some amazingly lifelike representations of the night sky
over Greenwich.
Even so, as Robert Matthews points out in Unravelling the Mind of God
(Virgin 1992), the question still remains: What started the Big Bang?
Perhaps the question is not worth asking. Hawking and Penrose showed in the
1960s that if Einstein's relativity theory is correct, at the instant of
creation the known laws of physics yield nonsensical results. More recently,
however, Hawking and his colleagues at Cambridge University have been
calculating what might happen if the the ordinary laws of gravity were
somehow to merge at enormous temperatures with the quantum theory which
governs the interaction of very small particles. Although these ideas are
still tentative, Hawking predicts that in the unimaginable heat of the
earliest stage of the universe, time itself would be swallowed up and become
a dimension of space. It would then be impossible to go further into the
past, although there would be no starting point. Hawking likens this to the
North Pole: you cannot go further north, but you cannot fall off.
Fantastical as this may sound, it is no more absurd than the predictions of
quantum theory, which are verified in laboratories throughout the world
almost daily. Quantum mechanics were developed early in the century to
explain the behaviour of atomic particles which refused to obey the laws of
mechanics which govern larger objects such as cricket balls and planets.
This theory, explained elegantly in John Gribben's In search of
Schrodinger's cat (Bantam 1984) shows that when two particles bump into each
other we cannot predict in advance what will happen, only the probability of
different outcomes, and these possible outcomes coexist until the observer
checks the result. Thus a single photon of light presented with two slits in
a piece of paper will go through both. Only afterwards, when the observer
decides how to view the event, will the photon 'decide' which slit it
'really' went through. The late Richard Feynman, the Nobel laureate, warned
an audience of Australian students that they would not understand this,
because he did not himself. The theory is repugnant to common sense, and was
deeply disliked by Einstein, but it has been verified repeatedly.
Now quantum theory is deeply implicated in the modern explanations of the
Big Bang. One of the things it says is that empty space is not empty at all,
but seething with particles popping into and out of existence in a tiny
fraction of a second. Incomprehensible? yes, but nobody doubts it to be
true.
So is there 'somewhere else' that they come from? The question suggests to
some theorists that our universe may be just one of many running in
parallel. So perhaps that photon really did go through both slits, one in
our world and the other in a different universe.
Be that as it may, Big Bang theorists suggest there may have been lots of
bangs creating other universes, all connected by 'wormholes' through time
and space. They also speculate that the Big Bang may have been seeded by
just a random appearance of particles predicted by quantum theory. Physics,
it may be objected, is at this point exploding into speculation. But this is
partly because ordinary science has shown the world to be far stranger than
used to be suspected.
At the mundane levely, chaos theory, described beautifully by James Gleick
in Chaos (Penguin 1991) showed that apparently simple equations of physics
can produce startlingly unpredictable results, so that science cannot, even
in principle, predict everything. Moreover, in pure mathematics Kurt
Godell's theorem has shown that some propositions must be unprovable. Paul
Davies thinks that this discovery dooms the physicists' ambition to reach
the mind of God via a grand theory which would make the universe completely
comprehensible. If so, Einstein may turn out to be wrong twice over.

FT  18 APR 92 / Afghan rebels encircle Kabul: Overthrow of Najibullah
jeopardises UN-sponsored peace plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALEXANDER NICOLL, Asia Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AFGHAN guerrillas were poised early this morning to launch an assault on
Kabul to try to force a military solution to the country's 13-year civil
war, as intensive efforts were made to arrange a political settlement.
The mounting crisis comes after President Najibullah's removal threw United
Nations-sponsored peace negotiations into doubt.
The government in the capital, in the hands of Najibullah's generals and
ministers, appeared increasingly fragile as rival guerrilla groups encircled
the city.
The guerrillas, who have been fighting to unseat Najibullah's
Soviet-installed regime, have intense rivalries among themselves and have
been unable to agree on their participation in a peace accord. There were
reports of their troops opposing each other close to Kabul.
The UN Security Council, as well as the US, Pakistan and other governments,
issued urgent calls for restraint on all sides and for a political solution
amid fears that Afghanistan could descend further into anarchy.
Mr Benon Sevan, the special representative of the UN secretary-general, was
holding urgent talks in Kabul to salvage his peace plan, under which
Najibullah was to have handed over power to a 15-man neutral council. This
would have led to an interim government and eventually to elections.
On Thursday, Najibullah was stripped of power by his ruling party and
attempted to leave the country, but was turned back at Kabul airport. He is
now in hiding in the city, probably in a UN office. The chief of the
security police committed suicide.
The 44-year-old president, who had been security chief to President Babrak
Karmal, installed by the Soviets on their invasion in 1979, held office for
six years.
Other leading members of the ruling Watan (homeland) party pledged their
commitment to the UN plan. But there were fears that the peace plan could be
rendered irrelevant if mujahideen guerrilla groups fought with each other to
assert control.
Mr Abdul Wakil, Afghan foreign minister, left Kabul for a meeting in
Charikar, 40 miles north of the capital, with Ahmad Shah Masood, leader of
the Jamiat-i-Islami guerrilla faction which controls much of the north of
the country.
He later returned but it was unclear whether the two men had met.
Mr Farid Ahmad Mazdak, a leader of the Watan party, said the government
could work with Masood and several other prominent guerrilla field
commanders.
'With the departure of Najibullah, there is now no obstacle in the way of
peace,' he said. 'It is important for us to achieve understanding with our
mujahideen brothers without delay.'

FT  18 APR 92 / De Benedetti vows business as normal despite sentence
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
MR Carlo De Benedetti, the Italian industrialist, said that he would conduct
business as normal, in spite of being sentenced on Thursday to six years and
four months in jail for his role in the 1982 collapse of Banco Ambrosiano.
Mr De Benedetti and most of the 32 other defendants yesterday announced
appeals against the ruling. Although he felt 'profound bitterness' towards
the judgment, Mr De Benedetti said he had not lost his 'peace of mind and
desire to work'.
Under Italy's complex legal system, none of the accused are likely to go to
prison for some time, if at all. The appeal procedure will take months, if
not years, and the case may then be referred to the supreme court.
Shares in companies associated with Mr De Benedetti made up much of the
ground lost after Thursday's judgments. Ordinary shares in Olivetti, the
computer group controlled by his CIR holding company, closed at L2,660
(121.24p), just below Wednesday's close of L2,680, after tumbling to L2,605
on Thursday.
Appearing calm and in good humour after returning from a holiday in Spain to
a hastily-arranged Milan press conference, he avoided making any political
accusations regarding the sentences. Many of his co-defendants have attacked
the judgments as being highly politicised.
Mr De Benedetti's independence from the political establishment and
occasionally outspoken comments have earned him enemies in Rome over the
years.
Last night, however, Mr Nino Cristofori, a junior minister and close adviser
to Mr Giulio Andreotti, the prime minister, expressed 'puzzlement' about the
sentences on Mr De Benedetti and Mr Giuseppe Ciarrapico, a financier close
to Mr Andreotti.
Mr De Benedetti, who was deputy chairman of Banco Ambrosiano for just 65
days, shed some light on his relationship with Mr Roberto Calvi, the bank's
chairman, who was found hanging under Blackfriars Bridge in London shortly
before the bank collapsed owing Dollars 1.3bn (Pounds 730m).
Mr De Benedetti said Mr Calvi had indicated his intention to step down as
chairman within a few months, leaving the way open for him to take the job.
However, it became clear within days that Mr Calvi had changed his mind. Mr
De Benedetti resigned after being told his position as deputy chairman would
not be confirmed.
He stressed he had consulted the governor of the Bank of Italy before taking
the job, and had made clear his doubts about Ambrosiano's management on
stepping down. 'I don't know what more I could have done.'

FT  18 APR 92 / Brown and Blair may take key policies role
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR GORDON BROWN, Labour's trade and industry spokesman, and Mr Tony Blair,
its employment spokesman, are likely to play an important role in
overhauling the party's policies if Mr John Smith, the shadow chancellor,
wins the leadership.
Mr Smith, favourite in the contest, has brought in Mr Brown and Mr Blair to
help formulate his campaign manifesto, as he faces pressure to broaden the
debate on the future of the party.
Working with Mr Robin Cook, the campaign manager, they would take a
prominent role in an enhanced policy review after Mr Smith's victory. It is
part of a move to counter claims that Mr Smith would only continue reforms
started by the outgoing Labour leader, Mr Neil Kinnock.
Yesterday Mr Bryan Gould, Mr Smith's main rival, said candidates 'should not
deliberately exaggerate differences', calling for a debate between the
contestants and an agreement on 'ground rules'.
Mr Gould, who is also running for the deputy leadership, portrays himself as
a radical candidate. But his comments may also have been aimed at allaying
fears that Mr Smith could not work with him if he were to become deputy
leader.
Mr Brown and Mr Blair are expected soon to announce policy initiatives, with
Mr Smith, on issues including Scottish devolution and a bill of rights - but
not electoral reform.
Labour embarked on a new rolling programme of policy formulation at its
Brighton conference last year. But Mr Smith wants a streamlined,
forward-looking review, distinct from that following the 1987 election, to
prepare the party for a late 1990s election.

FT  18 APR 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar struts on empty stage
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE dollar stole the limelight from a sleepy pound on Thursday as strong
economic data gave the US currency an afternoon boost, writes Peggy
Hollinger.
The dollar closed at DM1.6650 in London, after hitting a high of DM1.6730,
on a quiet day as traders prepared for the Easter holiday.
Yesterday, in extremely thin, short-day trading in New York, the dollar
finished at DM1.6685.
On Thursday in London the US currency had opened stronger because of
uncertainties surrounding Libya and Russia. It was further strengthened by
surprisingly good trade figures which showed the merchandise deficit had
fallen to the lowest level in almost nine years - from Dollars 5.2bn in
March to Dollars 3.4bn in February.
There was more good news for the dollar in the weekly jobless claims which
fell by 18,000 to 415,000. A mere 2,000 drop had been expected.
'Both figures were interpreted as adding fuel to the recovery story,' said
Dr Gerard Lyons of DKB International. He added, however, that the sum total
of the figures out last week showed recovery would still be sluggish. 'It is
nothing to get too excited about just yet.'
The dollar strengthened against most currencies, barring the yen, where it
weakened from Y133.45 to Y133.40.
Leaks from Japan surrounding the forthcoming G7 meeting implied that the US
would seek a relaxation of Japanese fiscal policy while, in return, Tokyo
would maintain interest rates.
Sterling fell against the US unit from Dollars 1.7560 to Dollars 1.7475 at
Thursday's close. In New York yesterday it slipped to Dollars 1.7445.
The Swiss franc weakened from SFr1.5345 to SFr1.5435 in London before the
start of the holiday. The currency won some unwanted attention for its sharp
decline against European currencies. The D-Mark took gains, climbing from
92.04 centimes to 92.56 centimes. This brought the D-Mark/Swiss franc to
levels not reached in more than 10 years, said some traders. The Swiss
National Bank did not intervene, although some traders speculated that
further weakening could bring the central bank in next week.
The D-Mark found a less ready reception elsewhere among European currencies,
and fell to its lowest level in almost a year against the French franc,
dropping from FFr3.3823 to FFr3.3800.
Sterling continued to keep its head above DM2.91 in thin European trading.
Dealers said there was still strong underlying demand for the pound and most
looked for the currency to nudge the DM2.95 barrier soon.

INLAND Steel, the struggling Chicago steel maker, decreased its net loss in
the first quarter of 1992 compared with last year and, after a long gloomy
period, expressed cautious optimism about the future, writes Barbara Durr in
Chicago.
It posted a net loss in the first quarter of Dollars 27.4m, or Dollars 1.14
per share, compared with a loss of Dollars 40m, or Dollars 1.50 last year.
Sales rose 8 per cent to Dollars 895.9m from Dollars 832.7m a year ago.
Mr Frank Luerssen, Inland's chairman, said the improved performance
'reflects a better mix of products as well as our efforts to reduce costs'.
Time Warner, the US media group, is undertaking a private placement of
Dollars 1bn of long-term debt with institutional investors, AP-DJ reports.
Proceeds will be used to reduce the company's commercial bank debt.

FT  18 APR 92 / UK Company News: Asset disposals at Lilley after plunge to
losses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lilley, the Glasgow-based construction company, has announced a number of
asset sales and a re-organisation of its property joint ventures following a
pre-tax loss last year.
The company has sold housing land in north-west England for Pounds 3.75m and
a 4.625 per cent stake in Hong Kong's second cross-harbour tunnel for Pounds
3.1m.
It is also selling its stake in three property developments to its joint
venture partner London and Edinburgh Trust, part of Sweden's SPP group. In
return, LET is selling its shares in two smaller developments to Lilley.
Lilley will be paid Pounds 18.2m as consideration for the LET transactions.
The proceeds will be used to reduce group borrowings.
The disposals follow the announcement of pre-tax losses of Pounds 5m for the
year to December 31, compared to profits of Pounds 14.1m, following heavy
losses in the housebuilding and property development division and an
exceptional charge of Pounds 12m to cover falls in land values.
Turnover increased to Pounds 340m (Pounds 323m) due to increased contracting
sales of Pounds 260.8m (Pounds 236.9m). The division's order book increased
to Pounds 186m at the end of March from Pounds 181m a year earlier.
However, operating profits from contracting increased only slightly to
Pounds 9.7m (Pounds 9.1m) due to margin pressure. Profits from specialist
contracting fell to Pounds 2.6m (Pounds 4.9m) despite almost maintained
turnover.
Housing sales declined from 463 units to 356 units. Average sales prices
increased to Pounds 72,000 (Pounds 66,000) but margins were eroded by
incentive offers. The division incurred an operating loss of Pounds 200,000
(Pounds 3.3m profit). Housing and property development reported combined
losses after exceptionals of Pounds 15m (Pounds 3.13m profit).
Earnings fell to 3.53p (7.99p). The final dividend is cut to 1p to make an
uncovered total of 2p (2.5p).
Net borrowings at the year end totalled Pounds 30.2m (Pounds 31.1m), giving
a debt/equity ratio of 64.1 per cent. The unwinding of the LET joint
ventures only affects off-balance sheet borrowings, which will fall from
Pounds 46.6m to Pounds 23.6m at the year end.
There were losses attributable to shareholders of Pounds 4.77m (Pounds 4.09m
profit). Combined with the dividend charge, retained losses totalled Pounds
8.9m (Pounds 41,000 retained profit).
COMMENT
Lilley's decision to get back to basics by withdrawing from most of its
property development businesses may be welcomed by the market. But
unfortunately for the company, the benefit is entirely off balance sheet,
and the debt/equity ratio remains uncomfortable at over 60 per cent. With UK
construction output set to fall again this year, and with Lilley's
housebuilding activities too small to swing it round single-handed, this
year will be difficult. Forecast profits of Pounds 4.5m put the shares on
just under 12 times, suggesting they are fully valued.

FT  18 APR 92 / UK Company News: UK buyers blocked by block condition -
Selling 60m Midland shares in one place lends uncertainty to HSBC's bid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, BRONWEN MADDOX and DAVID BARCHARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE 60m share stake in Midland Bank which overhung the market for three days
before being sold on Thursday, could not easily be placed with UK
institutions because the owner, Kuwait Investment Office, wanted to sell it
as a single block.
Investors said the lag in placing the shares also reflected underlying
uncertainty about the final outcome of the bid for Midland by HSBC Holdings,
parent of Hongkong and Shanghai Bank.
The stake - equivalent to roughly 8 per cent of Midland's total equity  -
was first offered for sale on Tuesday, the day HSBC Holdings, the parent of
Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation, offered paper worth 378p for each
Midland share.
On Tuesday and Wednesday, traders said the KIO was trying to sell its block
at 362p a share. At that time, the 3 per cent discount to the market price
was simply too small to encourage buyers in for a stake of that size,
investors said.
Significantly, market sources said that Lloyds Bank, which is thought to
have made a rival offer for Midland earlier this year, was not a purchaser
of the KIO's shares.
The difficulty the KIO had selling its stake only added to market anxiety.
'The KIO overestimated the ability and willingness of institutions to
arbitrage the stock,' said a fund manager with a large UK institution.
On Thursday, Hoare Govett, the stockbroker which has a long-standing
relationship with the KIO, was said to have completed the sale of a block of
60m shares at 356p each. Most of the buyers were said to have been US and
Asian-based arbitrageurs.
Midland's shares closed down 2p at 362p on Thursday. That day HSBC's shares
rose again, pushing the value of the all-paper offer to 396p. The gap
between the two prices indicated that Midland's shareholders might decline
HSBC's offer.
UK investors said that their ability to purchase the KIO stake was hampered
by technical factors. Although a valuable arbitrage could be achieved by
buying the Midland shares and selling HSBC's shares short, such a
transaction is difficult for non-UK shares. Also, settlement dates for UK
and Hong Kong stock markets vary, a factor which would have forced the
purchaser to hold the shares in both banks for several days.
But aside from technical considerations, institutions have expressed little
enthusiasm for the deal, and purchasing more Midland shares meant buying a
bigger stake in a bank they are uncomfortable with.
'There is an option (in the HSBC bid) to take bonds or equity and it's
likely we will take as much of the debt as we can,' said one large Midland
shareholder, who said he had been unhappy about Midland's association with
Hongkong and Shanghai Bank for years.
A lacklustre presentation to shareholders last Wednesday by the two banks
did little to woo the waverers.
Though few analysts believe that Lloyds will mount a counter-bid for Midland
against HSBC at this stage, they do not discount the possibility that Lloyds
might enter the field if the HSBC bid fizzles out.
The KIO still holds a 2 1/2 per cent stake in Midland.

FT  18 APR 92 / Plenty to chew over: How will the BBC shape up to the future
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BBC governors and top management will start arriving at Lucknam Park, a
secluded country-house hotel in the Cotswolds, just before lunch on May 20.
There they will enjoy good food and wine, stroll on the rolling lawns, join
BBC chairman Marmaduke Hussey around the swimming pool - and talk about the
future of the corporation.
It is probably the most important conference on the BBC they will ever
attend. Their task is to reach agreement on its future structure, role and
strategy in an age of multi-channel television.
Ironically, Lucknam Park was where the top-secret talks that led to the
merger of satellite broadcasters BSB and Sky Television in November 1990
were held, thus creating one of the longer-term threats facing the BBC.
Had the Labour party won the general election on April 9, the debate over
the corporation's future would not perhaps have reached its present
intensity. Though a Labour government might have created funding problems
with its uncosted manifesto commitments to concessionary licence fees for
pensioners, there was a feeling inside the BBC that it had an emotional
commitment to public service broadcasting. The Tories are perceived as far
more likely to pull the BBC up by its roots.
It is David Mellor at the head of the National Heritage department - already
designated the Ministry for Fun - who will handle the delicate negotiations
for a new Royal Charter for the BBC to replace the one that runs out in
1996. In some respects he is a lucky choice for the corporation.
In 1990, during his second stint as broadcasting minister, Mr Mellor
effectively put his career on the line by supporting a strengthening of the
quality commitments for ITV companies bidding in the competitive tenders for
franchises. The change of emphasis from highest bids to quality had not been
cleared with the then prime minister, Mrs Margaret Thatcher.
In preparing a consultative document on the corporation's future, for
publication later this year, Mr Mellor can be expected to be rigorous but
open-minded. The government cannot be expected to solve any of the
corporation's problems, however - problems being experienced by most public
service broadcasters across Europe.
As the number of television channels available through cable and satellite
networks increases, and competition intensifies for both finance and
audiences, all public service broadcasters face tough choices.
Mr Gerard Le Febvre, until recently director of strategy at CLT, the
Luxembourg-based broadcaster, believes that by the end of the decade in most
European countries there will only be room for one national public service
channel with one or two competing pay channels, up to three private general
interest channels and a growing number of specialist satellite channels.
For the BBC this scenario poses several basic questions.
Can the corporation retain a reasonable share of the audience? Will Wyatt,
managing director of BBC network television, has bravely identified his
minimum target: from 1992-93 BBC1 and BBC2 should be watched for a minimum
of two hours each week by at least 90 per cent of television households.
If the BBC audience does melt away, how long can the imposition of a
universal licence fee be justified, and should the corporation therefore be
financed partly by subscription or advertising?
Should the BBC refine its public service role and concentrate on worthy
programmes that the marketplace is unlikely to provide?
The BBC's attempts to answer some of these questions took on a farcical
aspect this week. No fewer than 15 task forces have been set up, each one
looking at a particular facet of the organisation. Inevitably they have come
up with hundreds of proposals, ranging from the inspired to the bizarre.
Privatise the BBC orchestras. Farm out the morning hours to an outside
producer. Contract out so many services that 10,000 jobs will be lost over
five years. Turn BBC Education into a public company.
It was equally inevitable that the confidential proposals should leak out.
On Tuesday, Bectu, the main broadcasting union, handed out copies of the
summaries of all 15 confidential reports along with copies of 'The Funding
Bible', the combined reports of consultants on possible methods of funding.
This document included a chart (left) showing the revenue that would accrue
from two minutes an hour of advertising.
Bectu officials quickly denounced the BBC for secretly planning to introduce
advertising, even though the chart indicated that it would be difficult for
the BBC to take advertisements without damaging ITV.
Other ideas - such as privatising orchestras -  have been publicly
repudiated by Sir Michael Checkland, the BBC director-general, before they
have been formally considered.
As the task forces were letting their minds roam over potential reforms, a
market-oriented policy known as Producer Choice was being introduced by the
corporation. Under it, producers will be able to hire camera crews, make-up
artists and, by next year, studios, outside the BBC, if they are cheaper.
The policy is designed to bring competition to an organisation accused by
its critics of waste and inefficiency.
Some staff say that chaos, poor morale and large-scale redundancies are the
more likely outcome.
Mr Tony Lennon, joint president of Bectu, says that in some areas BBC staff
would be unable to compete with outsiders even if they worked for free,
because of the high cost of their overheads. The BBC has set up a committee
to look into overheads and managerial redundancies will almost certainly
result. 'Absolute gloom' is how one old BBC hand described the present mood.
There is clearly tension between the conservatives - who probably could make
up most of the staff - and the radicals who take their cue from Marmaduke
Hussey, and Mr John Birt the deputy director-general who takes over the top
job on March 1. Sir Michael is unlikely to be approaching the need for
change with the same gusto as John Birt.
All the signs of the self-examination process are that what is being
contemplated is a redefining of the BBC's role rather than a radical
transformation - a modest move up-market away from the expected tough
competition between ITV and satellite television. To continue justifying a
universal licence fee the BBC will broadcast all kinds of programmes.
BBC comedy might, for example, be more Victoria Wood than Les Dawson. Radio
1 would still broadcast music aimed at young people but would leave the hit
parade more to the growing commercial sector.
Whether the BBC can be successfully repositioned without alienating its
staff and confusing its audience is open to question. Even before its
governors and managers get to the final lunch of their Lucknam Park
conference on Friday May 22, they will already have had plenty to chew on.

FT  18 APR 92 / Letter: Too hasty a decision
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Miss ANDREA DIPPLE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Despite the deferment of the date of the Labour leadership election
from Neil Kinnock's June preference to the compromise solution of July 18,
it appears that the Labour party is racing helter-skelter to appoint a
leader before a thorough and unhindered examination of the reasons for its
spectacular defeat on April 9 has taken place.
Surely it is fundamental to the crucial leadership decision-making process
that it has analysed and understood why the electorate chose to reject it
for the fourth consecutive term?
It is certainly not clear that this analysis can take place objectively in
the midst of a leadership election. Further, it is only when the party has
understood the reasons for its defeat that it will be able to make an
informed decision on who is most suitable to lead it towards its goal of
government at the next election.

FT  18 APR 92 / Tokyo tightens its belt: The recession is beginning to bite
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEFAN WAGSTYL and MITSUKO MATSUTANI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
I feel the recession has definitely arrived,' says Ms Itsuko Sagehashi, a
bar owner. 'People who used to come three times a week now come once a week.
Those who came once a month hardly come at all.'
Ms Sagehashi's bar, the Charing Cross, in Kichijoji, an affluent suburb of
western Tokyo, is decked out with souvenirs from Britain, including a large
map of the London Underground. It is open until late. The customers are a
cross-section of the city's middle class - accountants, salesmen and office
managers. If these men are starting to tighten their belts, it is a sure
sign that Japan's economic slowdown is beginning to affect average
'salarymen'.
Ms Sagehashi says: 'Conversation is really dull now. Until last year, people
used to talk about horse-racing and make bets in the bar. Now, even if they
bet, they don't talk about it.'
Two years ago, many ordinary Japanese were glad when early signs of trouble
appeared in the economy and the boom in stocks and land collapsed, The
victims were mostly over-borrowed speculators. In the minds of many, these
men got their just desserts for having bid up prices in the first place.
Today, there is growing evidence that the slump in the financial markets is
starting to concern even those who have never owned a share or a tsubo of
land (the standard 3.3-square-metre measure). As companies have cut
investment and costs, so employees have started to worry about the future.
Consumers last year began postponing purchases of cars and electrical
hardware. Now they are becoming cautious about clothes, household goods and
entertainment. Tokyo department stores this week reported that sales in
March dropped by 7.8 per cent over last year - the largest decline on
record. The sharpest fall was in corporate gift-buying. But everything from
spring fashions to consumer appliances was affected.
Mitsukoshi, the department store chain, says: 'Consumers still want to buy.
But they're becoming more aware of value and pay less attention to brand
names. People who bought Y100,000 suits a year ago, now buy suits for
Y80,000. Imported Y300,000 suits don't sell any more.'
Japan Air Lines estimates that for the Golden Week holiday in early May, a
peak time for holiday travel, bookings this year are down about 5 per cent.
Nothing serious, but enough to indicate consumers' growing caution.
So far, most Japanese feel the recession more in their minds than in their
pockets. There have been no large-scale redundancies. Unemployment is at 2
per cent and there are still 125 vacancies for every 100 job seekers. Few
Japanese have any real fear of losing either their job or their home.
Average household savings rose last year by 6.5 per cent to 11.28m. Japan
Housing Loan Corporation, a big mortgage lender, has problems with loans
made to developers but hardly any with lending to owner-occupiers. 'People
are now too pessimistic, just as in the 1980s they were too optimistic,'
says Mr Akio Mikuni, president of a credit rating agency.
However, companies are trimming bonuses - equivalent to about five months'
pay a year - and cutting overtime. For example, at Nissan Motor, Thursday
has been declared an overtime-free day. At headquarters the lights go out at
6.30pm.
The constant talk about recession undermines confidence. The average
Japanese may have almost as muchmoney in his wallet as a year ago but he
thinks it better to spend less, out of concern for the future. At the
Charing Cross, Ms Sagehashi says that one of her customers, a textile
company manager, tells her he used to have a mountain of papers on his desk.
Now there is nothing. So he leaves the office early and goes straight home.
He rarely calls at the bar any more.
The young, too, are becoming a little more careful with their money. They
still spend freely on ski trips and foreign holidays but they are beginning
to shop around. Mr Yamato Shiine, editor of Hanako, a magazine for young
women, says his readers now favour retailers' own-label goods over expensive
imported brands. They tend to stay away from expensive French and Italian
restaurants. 'Cheap Japanese-style western food is in - curry, rice and
spaghetti. Around Y1,500 a head.'
Rich people - doctors, lawyers and property developers who got out of the
market at the right time - are also spending a little less than before,
though they can still find plenty of outlets for their cash. Galerie
Tamenaga, a Ginza art gallery, says French Impressionist paintings are
hardly selling but there is demand for modern works priced at up to Y20m. A
nearby jewellery store says: 'Sales of Y5m items are down, but at Y1m
they're fine.'
Reminders of the boom times are still everywhere. Dai Ichi Kangyo Bank this
week celebrated the appointment of a new chairman and president with parties
in a luxury hotel - sushi and champagne for 8,000 guests. Honda Motor
launched a Y5m motorcycle, billed as the world's most expensive. Mercedes
Benz reports that its new S-Class models, Y10m and up, are selling well.
Fears of recession seem to prey on the minds of middle-class, middle-aged
managers more than anybody else. Nissan Motor, the car maker, sees the
social differences in their figures. It says sales of compact cars are doing
well. So are sales of luxury vehicles. But sales of mid-sized cars have
slumped, as they have for other manufacturers. An official says:
'Middle-managers buy these mid-range cars. They're concerned about future
business trends.'
They are also worried about mortgage payments, school bills and care for
elderly relatives. They remember the damage done to the economy by the oil
shocks of the 1970s. The customers of the Charing Cross intend to be
careful.

FT  18 APR 92 / Mud-slinging turns the US off: Political disenchantment can
be linked to the role of the media
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

'It is coverage wanting humanity, common sense and, not incidentally, news.
It is as if the plague of post-modernism had infected the newsrooms of our
greatest newspapers.'
 - Ward Just, veteran foreign correspondent and author, writing in the
Washington Post.
'That is the first positive thing I've read or heard about him this year.'
 - Anne Nesbet, lecturer at the University of Colorado, on being told last
week a mildly complimentary anecdote about Bill Clinton.
It is now a cliche to describe this American election year as one of great
political disaffection. Usually the blame is assigned somewhere between the
magnitude and intractability of the problems facing the country and the
shortcomings of those who want to lead it. Though the problems of earlier
times might be comparable, nobody of sound mind will claim that George Bush
or Bill Clinton and possibly H Ross Perot are reincarnations of George
Washington, FDR and possibly Theodore Roosevelt.
But the question is whether responsibility for this sad state of alienation
might also extend to the fourth estate, the presumed great intermediary
between the problem and the solution. There is more to this than standard
journalistic angst, for it really is the stuff of everyday conversation from
Maine to California.
In Britain, Neil Kinnock believes Labour's defeat was in good measure
attributable to the Tory press. Right or wrong, nearly four out of five
eligible Britons cast a ballot. By contrast, the US does not have an
ideological mass media and yet, barring a remarkable reversal of all known
trends, this November fewer than one in two will bother to vote for a
president.
Even if this comparison fails to take full account of differing political
and social structures, it is hard to deny the correlation between the
changing face of the US media and the engagement of the public in political
life.
The case for the prosecution can be briefly put: the media's long
adversarial tradition of hard reporting and muckraking, which claimed mighty
scalps from Boss Tweed, the 19th-century Tammany Hall boss in New York, to
Richard Nixon, and which made its share of mistakes as well, cannot but be
contrasted with today's tendency to presume wrongdoing about anybody even
contemplating entering the public domain, either politically or in any other
capacity. Somewhere in the wash, the necessary conveyance of conventional
news gets lost.
The politicians are not the only ones under the gun. Last week Arthur Ashe,
the retired tennis player, was 'outed' as an Aids sufferer by USA Today
newspaper. There was also an extraordinary investigation by the Washington
Post into the detailed deliberations of the Noriega trial jury, focusing not
merely on why they disagreed but who disagreed with whom.
The media justification in both cases, as with its scrutiny of the
politicians, is that Mr Ashe was already a public figure while the Noriega
jury de facto became a collective one. The New York Times argued that
raising consciousness on Aids mattered more than any right Mr Ashe had to
privacy. Similar logic was applied universally to the Noriega trial, with
the sanctity of jury deliberations considered secondary to the public's
'right to know'. The line from the Clarence Thomas hearings and the Kennedy
Smith and Tyson trials is clear: no stone gets left unturned.
Mr Clinton knows now that he can have no secrets. Russell Baker, in one of
his more semi-serious columns in the New York Times, argued that Mr Clinton
had been battle-hardened by the experience, especially in New York. The more
common view is that the pursuit of his private and public life, rather than
his policies, has seriously weakened his candidacy.
Time magazine, for example, this week devoted its cover story not to why he
won three primaries, but to why he is not trusted. Time's polling sample of
937 opinions was evidently considered a more important diagnostic resource
than the approximately 820,000 who actually voted for Mr Clinton on April 7.
The American media's reflex faith in polling has yet to be undermined by
evidence from across the Atlantic.
Switching its targets, but not raising its standards, last week ABC News
reported without a shred of broadcastable evidence that the house of Jerry
Brown, when governor of California, might have been used for parties, in his
presence or not, at which narcotics might have been consumed. His rejoinder
 -'Anyone who knows me knows I don't give parties' - paled into
insignificance compared with a presumed past sin.
Going for the front-runner is an old game. Mr Brown is not alone in arguing
that it was the media which anointed Bill Clinton favourite in the first
place, long before anybody voted anywhere. It was thus placed under a
particular obligation to scrutinise and dispatched squads of reporters to
Arkansas. It follows that once Mr Brown won the Connecticut primary, he
became eligible for the full treatment. So, for a while, did Pat Buchanan on
the Republican side, though it may also be the case that, as a media man
himself, he was treated rather gently in the beginning.
By this logic, President Bush should be next. The proven involvement of his
son, Neil, in a savings and loan scandal appears far worse than any conflict
of interest, still totally unproven, involving Mrs Hillary Clinton and her
Arkansas law firm. And if Mr Clinton strayed from the marital bed, there are
plenty of rumours the president has, too.
But it is also considered axiomatic that the Bush people stand ready to feed
the media even more dirt to use against Mr Clinton, should he win the
nomination, to the point that the Willie Horton commercials that laid Mr
Michael Dukakis low in 1988 will this year be reckoned tame enough to show
on children's television. The only contrary argument is that the Bush people
know the Clinton camp has dug up dirt on the president, thus creating an
unedifying stand-off.
This prospect has already been fully aired in the media.
So what is up? Like most changes, the US media has not transformed itself
overnight. Among many evolutions, it has become more national, less
parochial. USA Today is a ubiquitous publication; both the New York Times
and Los Angeles Times, the best of east and west, now have national
editions. In an atmosphere of more intense competition, the temptation to
run with the story rather than check or edit it grows.
The relationship between the writing press and television, once
characterised by an essential reliance for information by the latter on the
former, has shifted. No longer is it virtually automatic that whatever
appears on the front pages of the leading newspapers will appear on that
evening's TV national news. TV sets the agenda more.
Now the news divisions of the three main networks, CBS, NBC and ABC, are in
relative decline. They face competition not only from brash, smart and
round-the-clock CNN but from their affiliate stations, which have prevented
the extension of the national news from its current 30-minute format,
preferring local news and entertainment, the two often indivisible. This
year NBC is pooling its convention coverage with public broadcasting, the
chronic poor cousin, to save money. Only CNN is substantially increasing its
election budget this year.
One result is the soundbite. In 1968, according to one delicious survey, the
average time given to Richard Nixon and Hubert Humphrey to get over a point
was 42.3 seconds. In 1988, this has dropped to 9.2 seconds, enough for Mr
Bush or Mr Dukakis to say 'friends, Romans, countrymen, lend me your ears'
and not a word more.
A second consequence is the growing tendency to see paid political 'attack
ads' as newsworthy in themselves, because they are composed of soundbites,
professionally made and save a bit of work. Curiously, the experience this
year is that negative advertising may be ineffective. It certainly hurt
Tsongas in Florida, Brown in New York and Buchanan in Georgia.
Television, itself the developer of the cult of the personality, has also
made writing journalists into celebrities. No hack worth his or her salt in
Washington is complete without a regular television or radio outlet.
Candidates cannot escape either. So Clinton and Brown find it politically
necessary to appear on the Phil Donahue show, normally devoted to matters
typically addressed in the sort of supermarket tabloid which paid Gennifer
Flowers to say what she wanted.
What the public senses is the absence of any consistent attempt to address
the issues really bothering the country. This is now a complaint of the left
as well as the right, which has long thought all but its own media a liberal
coven. Last week, the University of Colorado put on its annual world affairs
conference in Boulder, as good an event as any to test the liberal
zeitgeist. Almost without exception, panellist after panellist, including
several self-flagellating journalists, denounced the trivialisation of the
media.
To some this was yet another adverse reflection on the isolation of
Washington, seen, in media as in politics, as an incestuous place. To others
it reflected the inability or unwillingess of television to portray complex
issues and the disinclination of the writing press to fill the substantive
gaps left by television.
And yet there is in the newspapers, and occasionally on television, no lack
of analysis of what is wrong with the social and political fabric of the US.
A Washington Post series by Dale Russakoff this week on the destruction of
the dreams and prosperity of a Pennsylvania steel town is Pulitzer
prize-worthy stuff, as, by universal acclaim, was a comparable exercise late
last year by the Philadelphia Inquirer.
Nor is all political reporting and commentary devoid of content, on TV as
well as in the print. To watch Robin MacNeil, of the MacNeil-Lehrer
programme, grill Clinton and Brown together on foreign policy last month was
to learn a lot. For anyone interested in the political process, the writings
of R W Apple Jnr, David Broder, Richard Cohen and a dozen others are
mandatory and readily available, many syndicated nationwide.
But too often neither seen nor heard, and that is a problem. Ward Just,
writing from Paris, is probably closer to Boulder than he knows when he
writes: 'This is what is going on; the fourth branch of government,
powerful, numerous, smug and prurient, protected by its own constitutional
amendment, is behaving like a gang of arrogant rich kids in an out-of-town
saloon, where anything goes and no one prosecutes.' Which is precisely what
the public is also saying about its politicians.

FT  18 APR 92 / Leading Article: Spring fever in London
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
AT FIRST sight, Mr John Major knows something that the rest of us don't. Not
only was his political self-confidence triumphantly vindicated, but the
British economic recovery he has been forecasting for so long started just
when everyone had given up believing in it. The figures remained grim up to
polling day; but in the week since we have learned that output rose in
February, and unemployment almost stopped rising in March.
The prime minister will have been less pleased with news that producer
prices and average earnings are still rising quite strongly; more has been
expected of ERM discipline. But the stock market, now taking a rosy view of
everything, has no doubt concluded that price rises show industrial
confidence, while higher earnings are a strong foundation for rising
consumer demand. Against this apparently improved economic background, the
10 per cent rise in equity values since the surprise Conservative victory
looks like sobriety itself.
Investors with long memories, however, will know that there is a standard
contrarian response to election results, especially to an unexpected result:
buy on a Labour win, sell when the Tories come back. The market stages an
instant funeral or celebration, and then relapses to its previous trend.
That conventional wisdom is supported by any long-term chart of moving
average share prices: there is almost no sign of changes of government.
However, this formula has no clear message at this stage, for by Thursday
the market had fully recovered its underlying trend, but had not yet
overshot it.
Economists have their own way of dampening high spirits, as is their dreary
habit: don't extrapolate figures for a single month, and do look at the fine
details. This changes the picture quite drastically. On the three-month
moving average, output was still falling in February, while the unexpectedly
good unemployment figures for March simply balanced the unexpectedly bad
ones the month before. There is also evidence that some planned lay-offs
were postponed in March to avoid the election season.
Darwinian process
Output prices are a matter of detail, not trend. All the bounce was in one
sector - drink and tobacco. This suggests that in the UK, as in the US,
these industries are offsetting the decline in demand for their products by
pushing up prices aggressively. It is a rise in the cost of addiction, or
the wages of sin. This is one way to confront weak markets, and has
interesting implications for equities in these sectors, but says nothing at
all about confidence in general. The rise in the wages of work reflects
quite a different response to demand weakness, and may be the real good
economic news this Easter. This is the first British recession in living
memory in which productivity, especially in manufacturing, has gone on
rising while output fell. This is partly a Darwinian process, as the least
efficient companies close down, but also shows positive progress, shown most
spectacuarly last week in Rover's Japanese-style labour agreement - 'a
greenfield agreement on a brownfield site', as the management proudly
claimed.
Employers have been achieving improvements which would have been regarded as
unbelievable not long ago, and have been happy to reward labour for its
co-operation. This may raise the 'going rate', and so push up costs and
prices in less exposed parts of the economy, especially in the service
industries. The bad news is that the resultant inflation numbers will
persuade the government that it must squeeze for the indefinite future -
when the banks are already applying all the restraint that even a puritan
could demand. But the good news is that manufacturing industry may be better
able than the Labour party's devaluationists imagine to live with a
demanding exchange rate.
Merciless squeeze
The good-news bad-news story really describes the British outlook very well:
high wages but high unemployment; good profits for the efficient but a
merciless squeeze on the indebted; a fairly sluggish growth in domestic
demand, but inviting costs and labour relations for foreign companies
seeking new capacity. Membership of the ERM is thus working in unexpected
ways, doing less than expected to cut inflation, but speeding up the
internationalisation of the UK economy. That may in the long run be the best
news of all for investors, for it suggests that UK shares will steadily rise
above their high-yielding, poor-relation status in world markets.
But there are two cautions. First, most British companies must more fully
earn the dividends they are already paying. Second, it takes two or more to
converge. While Wall Street is testing new highs as a real though probably
undramatic economic recovery is confirmed, Tokyo has lowered the
international target as dramatically as anyone could wish. The collapse
there has not yet spread internationally, as pessimists have expected -
indeed, Tokyo funk money may be helping to support London and New York. But
the dust cloud is likely to obscure long-term propsects for some time yet.

FT  18 APR 92 / Agents set to call in assets of more than 3,000 Names
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BARCHARD and RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AGENTS at the Lloyd's insurance market are likely to begin calling in funds
lodged by Names in the troubled Gooda Walker and Devonshire syndicates next
week, following a High Court judgment on Thursday.
Mr Andrew Pincott, of solicitors Elborne Mitchell, which represented 76
Lloyd's agents in a case brought against them by 820 Names, said: 'The cash
calls will go ahead. There is no doubt about that.'
The Names - individuals whose assets support underwriting at the market -
were seeking injunctions to prevent Lloyd's drawing down the deposits which
Names must lodge when they join the market.
Few expressed surprise at the court's decision. 'We only ever thought there
was a modest chance of our legal action succeeding,' said Mr Alan Porter,
deputy chair-man of the Devonshire Action Group.
More than 3,000 Names on four syndicates formerly managed by the Gooda
Walker agency are worst affected. Managers of the syndicates have made
little progress in collecting Pounds 101m - called for at the beginning of
March. The money is needed to pay insurance losses incurred in the 1989 and
1990 underwriting years.
The Names, represented by Mr Michael Freeman, argued that the cash calls
were 'improper'. But Mr Justice Saville ordered them to be paid. Mr Freeman
said the Names took heart from the fact that Lloyd's - which joined the
members' agents as a second defendant - was refused costs. An appeal was
unlikely, but the case would now be transformed into a 'substantive action
for damages and loss'.
Mr Pincott described the ruling as a benchmark verdict. 'It establishes that
calls will proceed unless they are dishonest or made for improper purposes,'
he said.
Mr David Coleridge, chairman of Lloyd's, welcomed the judgment: 'The primacy
of this principle 'pay now, sue later' has been upheld.'
Nevertheless, the decision will not prevent other efforts to obtain
injunctions. Mr Alfred Doll-Steinberg, chairman of the Gooda Walker Action
Group, said last week that he would take action before the end of the month.
Separately, another group of Names - organised by US lawyer Mr Andrew
Grossman - is seeking injunctions on the grounds that the loss-making spiral
reinsurance contracts entered into by Names could contain flaws which enable
Names to apply to have them set aside.
Names who have suffered said yesterday that they were not surprised by the
High Court ruling, and would step up the work of action groups which could
start legal proceedings for breach of contract and negligence.
As for the final outcome, Names affected by the cash calls are generally
realistic about their chances. Mr Richard Platts, a retired university
lecturer and a member of the troubled syndicates, said: 'We are fairly
confident that there will be some sort of market settlement but the people
who have been slaughtered will not be rescued.'

FT  18 APR 92 / Boost for mortgage rescues
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BARCHARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MORTGAGE rescue schemes have been given a fresh boost by a decision of the
Building Societies Commission, the industry watchdog, to allow societies to
take part in syndicated loans on property.
The move allows societies to lend jointly to housing associations which want
to buy flats and houses from the public sector. That will enable risk to be
spread between several societies.
The new power comes into force on June 1, but only societies with assets of
more than Pounds 100m - about 60 of the total 90 societies - will be allowed
to use it. Approval from their annual general meetings will be required, but
that is not expected to prove a cause of delay as most such meetings are to
be held in the next two months.

FT  18 APR 92 / Euphoria succumbs to hard currency reality / A look at the
change of mood in the money markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN'S interest-rate euphoria proved shortlived. Hopes that Mr John
Major's winning of a fourth term of government might be followed by a swift
fall in borrowing costs have been dashed.
Events on the money markets since last week's election victory suggest that
the government is in no rush to lower rates. Once it is, it will find that
its power to determine interest-rate policy is limited.
UK membership of the European Monetary System protected sterling from
speculative attack in the election campaign. But the EMS is now more likely
to be blamed for preventing the government from bringing interest rates more
into line with the country's needs.
Bank base rates, which have been stuck at 10.5 per cent for more than six
months, are unusually high given that the UK is struggling to get out of its
longest recession since the 1930s and that inflation, as measured by the
retail prices index, has fallen to a year-on-year rate of 4 per cent.
Yet the chances of a big cut are slim, and will remain so while Germany's
Lombard rate stays at the 9.75 per cent fixed in December when the
Bundesbank announced a 0.5 percentage point increase in Germany's key
interest rates.
Germany still provides the anchor currency for the EMS in spite of a surge
of inflationary pressures since unification. The view in the Treasury is
that the present 0.75 per cent differential between UK and German short-term
interest rates is small by historic standards, making a cut in UK rates less
likely in the absence of lower German interest rates.
A modest 0.5 per cent cut in UK base rates cannot be ruled out, however. The
authorities have been waiting to see how sterling settles down after the
election. The chances of a rate cut could increase if sterling continued to
strengthen and moved above its DM2.95 central rate in the EMS exchange rate
mechanism.
So far, the Bank of England has displayed no enthusiasm for a cut. In
response, the three-month interbank rate, which often acts as a guide to
base rate movements, was only slightly below base rate at about 10 3/8 per
cent this week.
During the election campaign Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, made clear
that he accepted the constraints imposed by UK membership of the ERM. He
said that historians would probably say that Britain joined the ERM at a
very difficult period.
The chancellor nailed his colours to the ERM mast when he told a group of
Birmingham businessmen that it was providing Britain with greater price
stability, which would help the international competitiveness of UK
industry. Although in many ways a Euro-sceptic, Mr Lamont clearly regretted
Britain's non-membership of the ERM over the past decade. It would have
helped the UK 'enormously' in keeping inflation under control, he said.
Britain's ability to cut base rates from 15 per cent at the time of ERM
entry - and not to follow the majority of Germany's ERM partners in raising
rates following the German move in December - is regarded in the Treasury as
an achievement in itself. The dangers for the UK of lowering interest rates
to the German level or below were highlighted by France's experience at the
end of last year, when the Bank of France was forced to raise its money
market intervention rate to 9.6 per cent from 9.25 per cent following the
Bundesbank's tightening of policy.
Moreover, the Treasury does not believe that sterling interest rates would
fall below German rates if the pound quit the ERM. It points out that since
1979 there has only been one very brief period - in 1981 - when UK
short-term rates were lower than German ones. That was after two years when
sterling had been unexpectedly strong, allowing it to build up credibility
in financial markets. A strong pound is an integral part of the UK's
counter-inflation policy.
With an open economy such as Britain's, the Treasury cannot risk the
imported inflation that might arise from a US-type policy of cutting
interest rates sharply and tolerating currency depreciation.
Such policies can also have unwelcome effects if bond markets sense an
inflationary danger. While the US federal funds rate has been cut to 3.75
per cent, US bond yields are substantially higher. The US Treasury 10-year
bond currently yields 7.33 per cent while yields on a comparable UK
government bond, at about 9.13 per cent, are below base rate.
Another telling argument against an early and sharp cut in UK interest rates
is political. Mr Major has won an election victory in spite of the recession
that followed the post-election boom of 1988. A government priority now will
be to bring the electoral and economic cycles back into synchronisation so
that the Conservative party does not have to fight the next election in
similarly unfavourable circumstances.
Before embarking on significant interest-rate cuts, therefore, the
government may wait until Germany starts to lower its rates. This week
German money market rates have been indicating no change for at least six
months.

FT  18 APR 92 / The party is finally over for campaign workers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NO SOONER has the race for seats at Westminster ended than the race to cut
costs is under way.
After nearly 18 months of extravagant electioneering all three main
political parties are scrambling to get their costs under control.
Mr John Major's 'battle bus' is off the road and everything from mobile
phone reinforcements to the campaign aircraft have been returned to their
owners.
But, above all, the staff reductions have started. Mrs Gillian Shephard, the
new employment secretary, may look in vain for 'glimmers of hope' in the
April and May unemployment figures if trends among political workers are any
guide.
The Labour party is engaged on arguably the severest retrenchment, issuing
redundancy notices to between 90 and 95 staff around the country who were
hired on temporary contracts over the past two years.
Those receiving notices include Mr David Hill, Labour's director of
communications - although in his case the contract is likely to be extended.
The party said: 'We are not proposing to move ahead in three weeks' time
without a director of communications.'
All told, Labour is aiming to reduce numbers to fewer than 200 around the
country from about 300 at the height of the campaign. The cash-strapped
party is expected to run a tight ship in the aftermath of the election,
operating with fewer staff than it had on the books two years ago. On a more
positive note, the party said it had stayed within its election budget and
had grossed more than Pounds 2m from fund-raising activities during the
campaign.
It made a profit from escorting journalists on Mr Neil Kinnock's energetic
campaign tour. Many newspapers, having paid more than Pounds 5,000 for the
privilege of accompanying the Labour leader, will not be surprised by this.
At Conservative Central Office numbers will be whittled down to a core staff
of 150 from 335 during the election campaign, as volunteers depart. Several
longstanding employees will also take advantage of a natural break to move
or return to City firms or lobbying. The focus of activities will switch
from communications to research.
The Liberal Democrats will part company with most of their workers hired on
temporary contracts, although the party will try to ensure that no full-time
employees lose their jobs.
A review of staffing at Westminster and party headquarters is to be
undertaken in the next month.

PUBLIC-SECTOR finances deteriorated by a record Pounds 6.4bn in March as big
increases in government spending and weaker tax revenues led to higher
borrowing. The monthly figure, the highest since records began, brought the
public sector borrowing requirement for the fiscal year to Pounds 13.9bn.
Excluding privatisation receipts, the borrowing requirement for March was
Pounds 6.5bn and for the fiscal year it was Pounds 21.8bn. That compares
with Pounds 4.9bn in 1990-91.

Sheriff Douglas Risk said Captain David Anderton made his approach in such a

He was remanded until Monday.
Mr Renton, who resigned as a director of Edinburgh-based Waverley Asset
Management on February 6, was also a director of Wentworth Investment
Services. On Wednesday Wentworth was suspended by Fimbra in connection with
the alleged disappearance of Pounds 4.5m from four investors.
It is not clear exactly how much investors' money is said to be missing from
either of the two concerns. Although Mr Renton was a director of Waverley, a
holding company for several investment businesses, he was said by it
yesterday to have had responsibility for only the private-client business.
Waverley has been winding down its private-client business for some time and
had about Pounds 1m under management, according to an official there. It is
believed that all of those funds are missing.
Meanwhile Waverley's other businesses, which include the management of
quoted unit trusts, are under review by Imro and Lautro, self-regulating
bodies to which Waverley belongs. The company said yesterday that it had not
received notification of any official investigation, although 'discussions
with Imro have naturally taken place following the arrest of Mr Renton'.
There is no suggestion that other directors of Waverley knew of Mr Renton's
alleged activities or that other businesses have been affected. Regulators
are due to meet the directors on Tuesday.

FT  18 APR 92 / North Sea gas project approved
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CONOCO, a subsidiary of US group DuPont, and Total Oil, the French resources
group, have been given approval for a Pounds 400m gas project in the North
Sea in a development that could open up large additional reserves in the
area.
Conoco estimates that potential gas reserves around the new development,
which is 180km off the Lincolnshire coast, are as high as 2,000bn cu ft.
The two companies plan to develop separately the Caister and Murdoch gas
fields in the southern part of the North Sea and build a gas gathering and
pipeline system as a joint venture. Lasmo, Arco and Canadian Oxy are
minority partners in the project.
Caister is estimated to contain 320bn cu ft of gas and 2m barrels of gas
condensate, and Murdoch has reserves of 300bn cu ft of gas and 3.5m barrels
of condensate.
Gas from the complex will start to flow in the last quarter of next year,
reaching a peak in 1994 of 300m cu ft a day. The pipeline system will have
capacity to carry 750m cu ft of gas a day and will be able to link with new
discoveries in the area.
Caister gas is already sold under contract to National Power, the
electricity generating company, and negotiations are at an advanced stage on
the sale of gas from the Murdoch field to the UK industrial market.

FT  18 APR 92 / Major will be urged to hold Scottish referendum
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LEADERS OF the Scottish Constitutional Convention are to call on Mr John
Major, the prime minister, to hold a referendum on Scotland's future.
The move, announced after yesterday's meeting of the convention's executive
committee, follows the general election in which the Tories increased their
total of Scottish seats to 11 while receiving 25 per cent of the vote north
of the border.
It comes less than a week after the Labour party in Scotland challenged Mr
Ian Lang, the Scottish secretary, to hold such a referendum.
Leaders of the convention, which includes Labour and the Liberal Democrats,
will make fresh overtures to the Conservatives and the Scottish National
party, both of which have boycotted the convention since it was founded in
1989.
Canon Kenyon Wright, executive committee chairman, said the convention's
model for a devolved parliament within the UK with limited tax-raising
powers has been 'put on one side for a while'.
Canon Wright suggested Mr Major's appointments to the Scottish Office
indicated he was trying to be accommodating. What would most endanger the
union would be an attitude that present constitutional rules were
unbreakable, he said.
Earlier, Sir David Steel, the former leader of the Liberal party, urged the
government to consult other parties about holding a referendum, saying Mr
Lang had not ruled this out.
Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, prepared the ground for
restarting 'round-table' talks on the province's future yesterday with
leaders of the nationalist Social Democratic and Labour party and the
cross-community Alliance party.
He will meet Irish ministers in the next two weeks, after which a gap in
Anglo-Irish conferences is expected to be announced - paving the way for the
resumption of the talks which were suspended before the UK general election.
The Earl of Arran, formerly junior armed forces minister at the Ministry of
Defence, is to become a junior minister at the Northern Ireland Office, it
was announced yesterday. He is replaced at the ministry by former Tory MP
Viscount Cranborne, who becomes a life peer.
His appointment completes the prime minister's post-election ministerial
shuffle.
Mr Malcolm Bruce, the Scottish Liberal Democrat leader, is to stand down
from the post. Nominations for the election of his successor close on May
15.

FT  18 APR 92 / Many offices 'do not meet needs'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER, Property Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MANY OFFICES built during the late 1980s do not fully meet occupiers' needs,
according to a report by Debenham Tewson Research, a property adviser.
The report says companies seeking to relocate are often faced with an
inadequate choice which forces them to make compromises.
Mr Stephen Webster, a director of Debenham Tewson Research, says: 'Even in
today's market, office oversupply turns out in many cases to be illusory.'
The figures on overall supply mask gaps in the market in terms of size and
quality of buildings, he says.
'Much of that which has been built by the development industry does not
fully meet occupiers' requirements, either in terms of location or
specification,' he adds.
The researchers examined the property market in the north-western sector of
the M25, where there is an apparent abundance of empty office space. It
found that 30 companies which had decided to move to the area had difficulty
in finding ideal premises.
Although the companies were usually satisfied with the amount of space, the
cost of the building and the quality of finish, they made compromises on
factors including air conditioning, parking spaces and the architectural
quality of the building.
The report says developers carried out inadequate research into the needs of
their tenants. Speculative developments are also handicapped by the need to
cater for as wide a range of potential occupiers as possible.

FT  18 APR 92 / Slowing of jobless total boosts recovery hopes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EXPECTATIONS of a move towards recovery have been strengthened by a broad
increase in productivity across the economy and an apparent lull in the
upward trend in unemployment.
The Department of Employment said output per person in the factory sector in
the three months to February rose by 2.9 per cent compared with a year
previously, the biggest quarterly rise since 1989.
For the economy as a whole, productivity in the fourth quarter of last year
was 1.8 per cent higher than a year before, the largest increase for more
than four years.
Seasonally adjusted unemployment rose by 7,400 in March after a revised
37,800 in February. Although the figure took the total out of work to
2,652,300, the highest for more than four years, it was the smallest monthly
increase since unemployment started rising in May 1990.
Wages per unit of factory output rose in the three months to February by 4.5
per cent compared with the same period 12 months previously. This was the
lowest figure since mid-1989.
Across the economy, wages per unit of output rose by 5.7 per cent in the
last quarter of last year compared with the same period in 1990, the
smallest figure since late 1987.
The 23rd consecutive monthly increase in unemployment meant that just over
1m more people are out of work since the recession started. The figure was
smaller than the City had forecast.
It means the average monthly increase in unemployment in the three months to
March is 33,700, compared with 42,400 in the three months to February.
Unemployed people as a proportion of the available workforce remained at 9.4
per cent last month, the same as in February. Ignoring seasonal variations,
unadjusted unemployment rose by 3,010 in March to 2,707,477.
Four regions - the north west, the north, Wales and Scotland - experienced a
decline in unemployment in March. The south-east, which has borne the brunt
of the recent rise in unemployment, was the worst hit in March. Numbers out
of work in the region, including Greater London, rose by an adjusted figure
of 7,600, pushing the unemployment rate to 8.8 per cent from 8.7 per cent.
In February the index of average earnings across the economy rose by an
underlying 7.25 per cent compared with the same month last year. The
equivalent figures for manufacturing and services were 7.75 per cent and 7
per cent respectively. In each case the figures did not change from the
comparable numbers for the year to January.
Other employment-related figures included:
Vacancies in Jobcentres rose by a seasonally adjusted 3,200 in March to
127,500. The past six months have seen an average monthly increase of 3,500.
The workforce in employment in December last year was 25,597,000, a fall of
226,000 in the final quarter and a reduction of 997,000 for 1991.

FT  18 APR 92 / Words that spell business failure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PHRASES such as 'optimistic about the future', 'thanks to our bankers for
their support' and 'poised to take advantage' in the chairman's statement in
a company's annual report may spell the end of the business, a study has
suggested.
The more incomprehensible the chairman's statement, it adds, the greater the
likelihood that the business is in financial difficulties, a study has
suggested.
Two academics have attempted to provide a simple way of assessing corporate
health by analysing chairmen's statements in reports which UK companies
produced in the 1980s.
Mr Malcolm Smith, of the school of economics, commerce and law at Murdoch
University in Australia, and Professor Richard Taffler, of the City
University Business School in London, found clear patterns when they
examined the reports of 66 companies, half of which survive and half of
which have failed. They found that the statements from the failed companies'
chairmen used sentences containing more words, and words with more letters
and syllables.
In a separate piece of research they found a correlation between the
incidence of particular words and phrases and imminent collapse.
The most fatal signs are nominal or non-payment of dividends, followed by
any mention of closure, sale or disposal, bank support, loss and overdraft,
loans or borrowing.
Reference to 'future loss' is a slightly stronger indicator of failure than
'future profit' but 'new managing director appointed' is more negative than
'managing director resigns'.
A paper the academics presented at the British Accounting Association annual
conference at Warwick University concluded: 'Poor readability is associated
with poor financial performance and ease of readability with relative
financial success.'

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A NEW Thai cabinet - made up of 41 politicians, four generals and four
technocrats - was appointed yesterday, almost a month after the general
election, Peter Ungphakorn reports from Bangkok.
The prime minister, General Suchinda Kraprayoon, and the five parties that
have agreed to support him, had difficulty in agreeing on portfolios.
The coalition holds only 195 seats in the 360-member lower house, so it
could prove fragile.
Gen Suchinda has put his own appointees in charge of the key interior and
finance ministries, and kept the defence portfolio for himself.
Mr Suthee Singhasaneh, an fiscally orthodox technocrat, remains finance
minister, as he has been since Gen Suchinda led the coup last year.
Mr Suthee's appointment means Thailand's traditionally cautious fiscal and
monetary policy is likely to continue.

FT  18 APR 92 / Pits face strike threat: British Coal dismisses Yorkshire
miners' protest at contracting out
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH COAL faces disruption at its Yorkshire operations after miners in
the region voted to stage selective strikes over work being contracted out
to private companies.
Although the majority in favour of industrial action was narrow - 5,131 to
4,984 - solidarity among Yorkshire miners is strong. It is likely that even
those who voted against would obey a union instruction to walk out.
Any action could provide British Coal with its stiffest industrial relations
test since the 1984-85 national pits strike.
Although Yorkshire miners have voted since then for industrial action over
pay, a less militant stance by colleagues in other areas has prevented them
going ahead.
Areas outside Yorkshire have not been balloted on the issue of contracting
out.
Mr Ken Capstick, National Union of Mineworkers' Yorkshire vice-chairman,
said the union was likely to call the action if British Coal refused to meet
it or to compromise.
The executive of the Yorkshire NUM, the union's largest area, is due to meet
on Wednesday.
The vote follows British Coal's plan to shift from the traditional 'advance'
system of mining coal to the 'retreat' method at Markham Main colliery in
Armthorpe, South Yorkshire.
Under the traditional system, miners employed by British Coal bring coal to
the surface as they advance along a coal face. The retreat method involves
bringing coal to the surface only after all the tunneling development has
been completed. The tunneling is a specialised job and, according to British
Coal, can often be performed more cheaply and effectively by contractors.
Although not a new system, the retreat method is increasingly in use, and
NUM members fear it will lead to significant job losses. At Markham Main,
which employs 730 workers, 35 jobs are at stake.
Since the end of the 1984-85 national pits strike, the British Coal
workforce in the Yorkshire area has been reduced form 38,000 to 13,000.
Mr Kevan Hunt, British Coal employee relations director, said the vote among
NUM members was as sad as it was futile. He said: 'The days have long past
since there could be any reward for industrial action. If action takes place
at any colliery it will threaten still further an already uncertain future.
'The proposals British Coal has made are essential if Markham Main is to
have any opportunity to continue in the future.'
Operations at Markham Main have shown a loss of Pounds 30m in the past five
years.

FT  18 APR 92 / Co-op checkout staff win 6.8% rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ABOUT 30,000 checkout operators employed by the Co-operative Union are to
receive a rise of 6.8 per cent after a review of wages aimed in part at
eradicating alleged pay discrimination against women.
The increase is part of a package for 70,000 shop, clerical, transport and
catering workers which will add Pounds 50m to the Co-operative stores' pay
bill in a full year. It is being recommended by Usdaw, the shopworkers'
union.
The proposed deal, which incorporates annual rises, provides a guaranteed
basic minimum increase, excluding un-social hours payments, of Pounds 5 a
week or 4.2 per cent, whichever is the higher, for all full-time adult
workers. This compares with an inflation rate of 4 per cent. With the
simultaneous introduction of a new grading structure for retail employees,
most will receive bigger rises.
The revision of the pay structure is similar to those by other retail
employers including Tesco and J. Sainsbury. All have wanted to guard against
claims from female employees that they do work of equal value to groups of
predominantly male workers but are paid less. Other retailers paid out more
following their reviews. However, most changed their grading structures at a
time when inflation and pay settlement levels were higher.
The rise takes the pay of the Co-op's checkout operators to Pounds 135.52
for a 39-hour week. When allowances for unsocial hours are stripped out this
translates into an hourly rate Pounds 3.34. This is below the minimum wage
of Pounds 3.40 an hour which the Labour party would have introduced from
next year if it had won the general election. By next year, however, when
the minimum wage would probably have been introduced, the Co-op rates will
have risen above Pounds 3.40.
Wages of clerical workers will rise from Pounds 135.61 to Pounds 141.31.
Mr Frank Dugdale, chief industrial relations adviser of the Co-operative
Employers' Association, said the package would keep workers in the
mainstream of employment benefits in the high street.

FT  18 APR 92 / Force of arms pushes Afghans near chaos / Assessing problems
in the wake of President Najibullah
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALEXANDER NICOLL and FARHAN BOKHARI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TWO weeks ago, Mr Benon Sevan, UN special envoy, was confident that
President Najibullah of Afghanistan would step down soon in favour of a
neutral council which would pave the way for an interim government and
elections.
Najibullah has indeed left office. But the manner of his leaving - forced
out on Thursday by his own ruling party as rebel guerrillas advanced on
Kabul - was not what Mr Sevan had hoped for after months of diplomatic
shuttling to seek a peace accord.
The era begun by the Soviet invasion in 1979 has ended. Najibullah was
security chief for Babrak Karmal, installed by Moscow as president, and he
superseded Karmal in 1986. He had been clinging to power as Moscow first
withdrew its troops in 1989 and then cut off all support this year.
However, it is unclear whether Najibullah's fall will lead to peace, or to
renewed bloody civil war between rival Islamic fundamentalist guerrillas.
Between 1m and 2m people have died in the conflict so far.
The international community's extreme concern was underlined by a UN
Security Council call, after an emergency session on Thursday night, for
restraint and a political solution. The US said it feared chaos and appealed
to all parties to lay down their arms and co-operate with the UN in
arranging a peaceful transfer of power.
But the many foreign countries which have participated in, financed or
manipulated Afghanistan's 13-year war now appear virtually powerless to
influence the immediate course of events.
Mr Abdul Wakil, Afghan foreign minister, said the new regime would continue
to be committed to the UN peace process. However, the ruling Watan
(Homeland) party's hold on power appears increasingly tenuous. Yesterday, Mr
Wakil left Kabul briefly to seek a meeting with Ahmad Shah Masood, leader of
one of the main guerrilla factions.
Forces loyal to Mr Masood, commander of the Jamiat-i-Islami group, have
taken Bagram air base, 30 miles from Kabul. Mr Najibullah Lafraie, Jamiat
spokesman in the Pakistani city of Peshawar, said the forces were poised
close to Kabul but had orders to halt outside the city. 'We are confident
that the citizens of Kabul, army officers and officials have good opinions
of Masood. We hope that the situation will go in favour of the mujahideen
(guerrillas), without bloodshed,' he said.
A deal between the government and Mr Masood, however, would almost certainly
be unacceptable to Mr Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, leader of the Hezb-i-Islami
guerrillas, who are also not far from Kabul. Mr Hekmatyar has rejected the
UN peace process.
Intense rivalry between mujahideen groups - these are the two most powerful
of many factions - is the biggest obstacle to peace. Their common goal, the
removal of Najibullah, has been achieved with the support of western and
Arab arms and aid. But the temptation to pursue separate military courses is
great now that military victory over government forces also appears so
close.
Mr Masood controls much of northern Afghanistan through his Supervisory
Council of the North. Mr Hekmatyar's territory is mostly south of Kabul. For
some time the government has controlled less than 20 per cent of the
country.
Pakistani officials have been meeting mujahideen leaders, many of whom are
based in Pakistan, since Wednesday to seek agreement on the composition of a
15-member neutral council due to take control of Afghanistan under the UN
peace plan. They are con-cerned that agreement will not be reached in time
for mujahideen leaders to return to Kabul so as to join new administrative
arrangements.
The West has supported the mujahideen but the prospect of a radical Islamic
state emerging in Afghanistan is a principal cause of international concern.
Afghanistan's historical role as a buffer state between empires would be
superseded, in the west's eyes, by one in which it was part of a growing
radical Islamic swathe.
Even more worrying for the west and for Moscow would be a balkanisation in
which warring guerrilla groups held various parts of the country and sought
to form links with their neighbours, including the central Asian republics
that were in the Soviet Union.
A further motive for international concern is Afghanistan's role as the
largest regional producer and exporter of heroin. A further period of
unstable, decentralised control would prevent attempts to bring the growing
and processing of opium poppies under control.
The refugee problem is also enormous. More than 3m Afghans have fled to
Pakistan during the war and more than 2m to Iran. Their resettlement in a
mine-studded country with a collapsing economy will be a huge challenge for
the international community when peace returns at last. They may have to
wait a long time to return home.

THE Libyan lawyer for the two men accused of involvement in the bombing of
the Pan Am airliner over Lockerbie in Scotland in 1988 yesterday reiterated
Tripoli's position that they could be conditionally surrendered abroad, but
not to Britain or the US, AP reports from Tripoli.
The remarks by Mr Ibrahim Legwell were similar to numerous Libyan offers to
surrender the suspects to neutral countries, but not to London or
Washington, which have requested their extradition.
Mandatory UN sanctions, including a ban on air travel to or from Libya, came
into force on Wednesday after the regime headed by Col Muammer Gadaffi had
refused to hand over the two men.
Earlier, Mr Lagwell said the men would go to Scotland or the US if a fair
trial was guaranteed.
Libya has told various foreign diplomats to leave the country, in
retaliation for a reduction in Libyan representation abroad demanded by
other countries in accordance with the UN sanctions.
Italy, Belgium, Brazil, Spain and Hungary were among the first countries
affected.
The cut in air links has forced passengers to travel overland to airports in
Tunisia and Egypt.

JAPAN's broad money supply expanded at a sluggish 1.8 per cent in March,
compared to a year ago, the Bank of Japan said yesterday, as a result of
weak demand for credit, writes Steven Butler in Tokyo.
Although the rate of expansion was slightly higher than the record low of
1.6 per cent in February, there was no sign in the money supply figures (M2
plus certificates of deposit) that the slowdown in Japan's economy was about
to change.
Money supply grew by 1.7 per cent in the first quarter of the year, far
below the central bank's original forecast of 2-3 per cent.

INDIA'S Congress party wound up its conference at Tirupati with a
declaration from Mr PV Narasimha Rao, the prime minister, that the state's
role in the economy should 'gradually taper off'.
He had earlier told delegates that there was 'no viable' alternative to the
pro-market policies the government had instituted. India could no longer be
proud of how the public sector was working. He said that the public sector
could not continue to syphon off resources from other sectors.
However, Mr Rao added that the state's role in providing economic welfare
should be enhanced. He pointed to the need to increase funds for primary
education and health.
During the three-day meeting, the government ran into far less flak from the
floor over the shift in economic policies than had been expected. The
leaders proposed a pledge of the party's continuing faith in socialism and
the Nehru model of a planned economy.

FT  18 APR 92 / UN grants Kuwait part of Iraqi port

A UN COMMISSION setting Iraq's long-disputed southern border has granted
Kuwait part of Iraq's only serviceable seaport and a larger portion of the
Rumaila oil field, AP reports from New York.
The decision is certain to anger Iraq, which used an old border dispute with
Kuwait to justify its August 1990 invasion of the emirate. A US-led alliance
drove Iraq from Kuwait in February 1991.
The Iraq-Kuwait Boundary Demarcation Commission said Kuwait would be given
part of Umm Qasr, which is linked to the Gulf by the Khor Abdullah waterway
and is near Iraq's major offshore oil terminal.
Iraq's main port, Basra, has been unusable since the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq War,
when sunken ships clogged the Shatt-al-Arab waterway between the port and
the Gulf.
The commission's rulings also grant a greater portion of the Rumaila oil
field to Kuwait.
It was not clear whether Iraq would comply with the rulings. Iraq is
represented on the commission but did not participate in the vote on its
rulings, apparently in protest.
Iraq accepted all terms of the ceasefire agreement that marked its defeat in
the war, including the creation of the commission. However, UN officials say
Iraq has not complied with other provisions of the ceasefire, including
demands for co-operation with UN inspectors overseeing the destruction of
its weapons.
Under the UN's Gulf War cease-fire resolution, the commission was mandated
to set the border with reference to a 1963 agreement which favoured Kuwait.

FT  18 APR 92 / Eminent call for greener ethics

<TEXT>
A GATHERING of former prime ministers, presidents and other eminent persons
yesterday released a Tokyo Declaration, calling for a 're-evaluation of the
thinking which underlies our present society' and the adoption of 'new
environmental ethics'.
The meeting, a precursor to the UN's Earth summit in June, also asked
governments to consider new taxes to protect the environment, to increase
financial assistance to developing countries, and to settle quickly the
Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations.
The meeting, sponsored by the UN Conference on Environment and Development,
urged Japan to take a political lead in the coming months to ensure the
success of the summit in Rio de Janeiro and to broaden the debate on
environmental ethics.
Mr Noboru Takeshita, Japan's former prime minister and official host of the
three-day meeting, promised that Japan would build 'a society oriented to
preserving the environment', though he gave few specific examples of how
this would be achieved.
The declaration's reference to environment-related taxes was a sensitive
point, as Japanese government officials had requested that the text not call
directly for the introduction of taxes. Tokyo is now 'informally' discussing
a tax on carbon dioxide emissions, similar to that introduced in Nordic
countries.
In the final draft, the declaration's reference to taxes read: 'Countries
may also wish to consider special taxes and charges in the context of the
global partnership being forged at Rio de Janeiro, keeping in mind the
impact on international competitiveness.'
'We appeal to the leaders of all governments to come to the Earth Summit at
Rio, prepared to commit themselves to the measures required to give effect
to a new global partnership for sustainable development,' the Tokyo
Declaration added.
The delegates agreed that developing countries need 'increased access to the
markets of industrialised countries', and this necessitates 'an immediate
and meaningful conclusion of the Uruguay Round'.
They also encouraged private companies towards a more important role in
making environment policy, and suggested developed countries arrive in Rio
with specific proposals for increased technology transfer to developing
nations.

FT  18 APR 92 / Bush and Clinton taking aim at each other
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT George Bush and Governor Bill Clinton of Arkansas are increasingly
taking aim at each other, rather than their respective party challengers.
In speeches on Thursday in Pennsylvania, which holds the next primary on
April 28, the president recycled an old proposal for increased student
loans.
Mr Clinton, front-runner for the Democratic nomination to oppose him in
November's election, countered that the Bush plan was politically cynical,
since the administration had previously done its best to cut student loan
programmes and was now borrowing from one of his own main education policy
positions.
Mr Lamar Alexander, secretary of education, tartly observed that 'if
Governor Clinton thinks it's a good idea, that's terrific. But his friends
in Congress don't think it's a good idea. Maybe he should talk to them.'
However, the main thrust of the Democrat's speech, given to the Wharton
School of Business, was to attack the president for mismanagement of the
economy and to present his own plans for the future. He gave a similar
speech on foreign policy in New York two weeks ago.
Mr Clinton cited the case of Mr Michael Milken, the convicted junk bond
dealer (and, incidentally, a Wharton graduate), as an example of where the
economic philosophy of the 1980s had gone wrong. 'We must bring an end to
this something-for-nothing ethic,' he said.
His blueprint, drawing together several previously stated positions,
includes a new Dollars 2bn (Pounds 1.1bn) tax credit for new investments;
making permanent the existing research and development tax credit, now
costing about Dollars 1bn a year; and a new 'enterprise tax cut' worth
Dollars 200m a year.
He would also establish what he called a 'future budget' to increase
investment in the country's social and physical infrastructure, running from
schools to roads and bridges. He promised to focus on the critical issue of
converting defence programmes into civilian output and to put more resources
into education and training.
This would be broadly financed by cuts in military spending, a reduction in
administrative outlays, and a determined effort in future to ensure that
costs stayed below the rate of inflation.
'We spend a quarter of what our competitors do on training programmes for
our workers,' Mr Clinton said. 'Last year Germany and Japan had productivity
growth rates several times ours because they educate their people better and
they organise their economies to change better than we do.'
The two speeches mark the end of what had been a lull in the campaign, with
Mr Clinton sidelined by an overworked voicebox and Mr Bush mostly attacking
the Democratic-controlled Congress.
The president's latest pitch is that he, not Mr Clinton, is the real
architect of change, though his critics have observed that many of his
recent policy proposals, including that on student loans, have been old
ideas dressed up differently.
But Mr Bush has less of a hill to climb in establishing his credentials than
does Mr Clinton, who needs to put the 'character' questions behind him and
clearly differentiate his policies from those of the president.
This extends even to what the two men eat. Yesterday, Mr Clinton, in a
Philadelphia street market, held up a stick of broccoli, the president's
least favourite vegetable, and said he liked it. The impact of this
staggering expression of preference has yet to be recorded in the polls.

All commercial banks in Zaire will close next week because of a cash
shortage, the Zaire Banking Association said yesterday, AP-DJ reports from
Kinshasa.
The Banking Association said that the Central African country's 12
commercial banks needed 10 trillion (million million) zaires a month for
their clients but were only getting 480bn a month from the Central Bank. For
months, the banks have been closed most of the time, dealing with selected
customers through the back door. However, most withdrawals are limited to
the equivalent of Dollars 10 to Dollars 15 and the zaire currency has become
almost worthless. The largest denomination bill of 100,000 zaire is worth
less than Dollars 1.

FT  18 APR 92 / Sentences end the Ambrosiano affair, Part I
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ITALY'S slow-grinding legal system has crunched forward with this week's
verdicts in the long-running Banco Ambrosiano trial. But as reactions to the
heavy sentences on the 33 defendants showed, the sparks have only just
started flying.
Hardest hit among the accused was Mr Carlo De Benedetti, the industrialist
best known as chairman of the Olivetti computer group. He was sentenced on
Thursday to jail for over six years, for his role in the collapse of the
bank formerly run by Mr Roberto Calvi, the financier found hanging under
London's Blackfriars Bridge in June 1982.
Although he appeared confident at a press conference in Milan yesterday, the
verdicts have already hit the image, if not the actual running, of Mr De
Benedetti's businesses.
However, his aides said the case 'will not bring any change whatever, nor
have any effect on the operations of Mr De Benedetti and the companies in
his group'.
Mr De Benedetti is not alone among prominent figures caught in the
Ambrosiano web. The others include Mr Giuseppe Ciarrapico, a financier and
close friend of Mr Giulio Andreotti, Italy's caretaker prime minister, and
Mrs Anna Bonomi Bolchini, the head of a prominent Milanese industrial
family. All were sentenced to heavy jail terms.
The longest sentences were reserved for Mr Licio Gelli, former head of the
banned P2 masonic lodge, and his assistant in the lodge, Mr Umberto
Ortolani, who received terms of 18 1/2 and 19 years.
Thursday's verdicts conclude the latest stage in a legal saga which began
after the bank's collapse in 1982 with Dollars 1.3bn (Pounds 734m) of debts
in Italy's biggest post-war banking scandal.
After a highly complex, eight-year investigation hearings opened in May
1990. The Ambrosiano shadow fell over Mr De Benedetti himself as a result of
his role as deputy chairman of the bank, a position he was invited to take
by Mr Calvi in November 1981.
Rather than eventually becoming chairman and having the opportunity to clean
up the bank, as he says he hoped, Mr De Benedetti stayed on board for just
65 days before stepping down in January 1982. At a crowded press conference
in Milan yesterday, he made clear he decided to leave at Mr Calvi's request.
'My feeling is that Calvi hadn't asked permission from whoever he had to,
and regretted it soon afterwards; indeed, within three days of my arrival,'
he said. Who Mr Calvi's mysterious bosses might have been was not made
clear.
In 1988, Mr De Benedetti was formally accused by investigating magistrates
of extortion, a charge levelled against a number of other bank employees.
Although he was acquitted in April 1989, another magistrate called next
March for him to be tried along with the other defendants, this time on the
new charge of fraudulent bankruptcy. The accusations focused on the
financial details of Mr De Benedetti's acquisition of a packet of shares in
the bank and another company on taking office, and their subsequent sale on
his departure.
Yesterday, he repeated his stance that the deals had been entirely above
board.
His lawyers are appealing against the verdict. Most of the defendants have
promised to appeal, and the case could even reach Italy's supreme court
after their appeals are heard, meaning the Ambrosiano saga looks set to win
a place in the record books for its length, if for nothing else.

FT  18 APR 92 / O&amp;Y needs two new bank loans next week
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
OLYMPIA &amp; YORK, the Cana-dian property developer, needs to raise vital bank
loans by the end of next week in the toughest challenge so far in its fight
to avoid filing for protection under bankruptcy procedures.
The Bank of England has been told that banks are reluctant to provide the
two new loans of Pounds 100m and CDollars 100m (Pounds 47.8m). They are
concerned the money could be lost if it were given before agreement is
reached on restructuring all O&amp;Y's CDollars 14.3bn debt.
O&amp;Y said yesterday: 'We are confident the banks will support us in the
belief that it is the best way for the banks to protect their own
positions.'
A banker involved in negotiations stressed the importance, for the property
group's survival prospects, of reaching agreement by the end of next week.
Over the next 90 days, O&amp;Y hopes to get its banks' approval for a
reconstruction package which would involve a freeze on principal repayments,
deferment of interest, the provision of Pounds 100m to pay for work at the
Canary Wharf development in London's Docklands and CDollars 100m for
Canadian expenses.
However, O&amp;Y needs to persuade banks to allow it to draw some of the Pounds
100m and CDollars 100m by the end of the week. Without the new money and
later agreement on the restructuring plan, O&amp;Y would be forced to invoke
insolvency procedures to seek protection from its creditors in the US, the
UK and Canada.
Bankers fear such a move would have a devastating effect on the already weak
property markets in the US, Canada and the UK.
A banker said that confidence among O&amp;Y's 100 banks would improve if the
Canadian government agreed to provide a short-term or bridging loan to
facilitate the CDollars 300m sale of the Exchange Tower in Toronto.
The proceeds of the sale are hoped to be used to pay off some of O&amp;Y's
commercial paper - short-term securities the group is being forced to
redeem.
'The Canadian government told us it would make a decision on the Exchange
Tower by the end of this week (today),' a banker said. 'But they have made
those kinds of promises before'.
Bankers hope the UK government will help to relieve Canary Wharf's financial
problems by agreeing to change the terms of O&amp;Y's Pounds 400m contribution
to the construction costs of the Jubilee underground railway extension,
which would link Canary Wharf to central London. Bankers hope that the
government will agree to defer O&amp;Y's payments for many years.

FT  18 APR 92 / Leyland DAF startsrecruiting workers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS and PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LEYLAND DAF has started re-cruiting production workers for the first time in
two years, in a sign that the UK commercial vehicle industry's worst slump
for 50 years may be ending.
This move by one of the UK's two biggest truck makers will add to hopes that
the UK economy may be poised for an upturn after a recession that started in
the second half of 1990.
Expectations about an upturn were fed by Thursday's lower-than-expected rise
in unemployment. They have also bolstered trading on the London stock
market: in five trading days since the general election the FT-SE 100 index
of leading shares has put on more than 200 points. The rally ran out of
steam on Thursday when the index closed 1.6 off at 2,638.6.
Leyland DAF's recruitment move coincides with the release of statistics
showing total UK commercial vehicle output up more than 40 per cent last
month compared with March 1991. Exports showed strong growth.
The statistics, published jointly by the Society of Motor Manufacturers and
Traders and the Central Office of Information, show that car output rose
8.44 per cent in March compared with the corresponding month a year before.
Leyland DAF's main rivals have yet to follow its recruitment move, which is
a modest one. It is taking on 60 people - increasing the shop-floor
workforce to just under 700. The recruits will be given three-month
contracts as a precaution against signs of recovery petering out.
Nonetheless the Lancashire-based manufacturer, which is competing with Iveco
Ford for leadership of the UK truck market, said that the economy should
benefit from a 'stable period' after the general election.
Demand from other European countries, notably Germany, has boosted Leyland
DAF's truck sales. Output is running 10 per cent higher than a year ago and
is expected to rise by a further 10 per cent in the immediate future.
For the UK as a whole, total commercial vehicle output in March, at 29,058,
was 40.74 per cent higher than the same month a year ago when the figure was
20,647. First-quarter output was 15.09 per cent above the previous year's
period at 66,708, from 57,963. Output for export in March was 78.22 per cent
higher at 16,567, and for the quarter 44.71 per cent up at 39,196.

MR TINY ROWLAND, chief exec-utive of Lonrho, returned to Britain from Africa
yesterday after having twice flown into Libya during the past seven days for
extensive and secret talks with Colonel Muammer Gadaffi.
Both Mr Rowland's visits to Libya, made on a corporate Gulfstream jet,
occurred before the imposition of the United Nations sanctions from midnight
New York time on Tuesday.
Mr Mark Too, deputy chairman of Lonrho East Africa, who accompanied Mr
Rowland on his trip, said in Nairobi yesterday that the meetings were
primarily to discuss further investment and business ventures between Libya
and Lonrho.
But he said that Mr Rowland and Col Gadaffi had also talked about ways of
ending Libya's international isolation following the failure of the Libyan
government to hand over the two Lockerbie airliner bombing suspects. Mr Too
said Mr Rowland was carrying 'confidential messages' from the Libyan leader
to the British government aimed at reaching a compromise.
'There are so many British companies doing big business in Libya and that is
the only reason why Britain doesn't want full sanctions because they would
lose the contracts and go bust,' Mr Too said.
Mr Rowland's Libyan trips follow last month's announcement that Lonrho had
sold Libya a one-third stake in the group's Metropole Hotels for Pounds
177m. At the March annual general meeting, Mr Rene Leclezio, Lonrho's
chairman, said Mr Rowland had personally secured the Libyan deal.
According to a financier close to Lonrho, Mr Rowland has had a series of
meetings recently with Col Gadaffi.
The personal relationship between the two men goes back to the early 1970s
when Mr Rowland was expanding Lonrho's interests into Sudan and the Middle
East.
Lonrho's decision to do business with Libya while the Lockerbie issue
remained unresolved was widely criticised by some of the group's biggest
shareholders and bankers.
If, however, Mr Rowland can help find a compromise to the current crisis,
pressure will be taken off Lonrho. Mr Too also said that, during the visits
to Libya, Col Gadaffi had given his backing to peace talks being brokered by
Mr Rowland and President Daniel arap Moi of Kenya, aimed at resolving the
bitter nine-year civil war in neighbouring Sudan.
Unusual secrecy surrounded Mr Rowland's flight plans after he left Heathrow
airport last weekend on board the Gulf-stream IV, call sign Hotel Bravo
Indigo Tango Zulu. BA's executive aircraft department at Heathrow said that
it had been instructed not to divulge any details of the aircraft's
itinerary.
But the Financial Times has learned that Mr Rowland and Mr Too flew on
Saturday April 11 to Sirte, in northern Libya, where they held a series of
meetings with Col Gadaffi and other Libyan officials.
Mr Rowland and Mr Too then flew on Sunday evening April 12 to Nairobi, where
Mr Rowland met Mr Moi to discuss his Sudanese initiative. On Monday evening
April 13, Mr Rowland and Mr Too flew to Khartoum for discussions with the
Sudanese military strongman Gen Omar Hassan Ahmed el Bashir, who gave his
endorsement to Mr Rowland's efforts. On Tuesday April 14 the two men flew to
Tripoli, arriving after midnight.
A further series of discussions were held on April 15 with Col Gadaffi and
senior Libyan officials. Mr Rowland and Mr Too left for Zare before the UN
sanctions came into force.

FT  18 APR 92 / US will press G7 nations to aim for faster growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   LONDON, WASHINGTON

<TEXT>
THE United States will next week call for the Group of Seven leading
industrial nations to carry out more growth-oriented policies in response to
its growing concern about the weak state of the world economy and the slow
pace of the US recovery.
Mr Nicholas Brady, US treasury secretary, warned in London that economic
growth rates were below the levels needed to deal with the problems of the
G7 countries, the former Soviet Union and eastern Europe and the rest of the
world.
Mr Brady said after a meeting with Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, that
'an inordinate preoccupation' with inflation would produce a level of growth
that was not satisfactory.
His comments were echoed yesterday by Mr Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve
chairman, who said he was not satisfied with the pace of the US economic
recovery.
He said: 'I don't find 2 per cent real growth, which is what we're
experiencing at this particular stage, adequate.' Testifying before the
Senate banking committee in Washington, Mr Greenspan warned that economic
data for January and February had overstated the strength of the US recovery
which was proceeding at a much slower pace than in past upturns.
Mr Greenspan's comments will fuel speculation that the Fed, the US central
bank, may be preparing for further cuts in short-term interest rates if the
economy fails to show greater vitality.
Senator Donald Riegle, Senate banking committee chairman, urged the US to
push the G7 to agree a co-ordinated global strategy when it meets in
Washington on April 26.
He said the US should be much more aggressive in getting an economic growth
strategy to ensure that the US economy did not slide back into recession
because of weaker growth elsewhere.
Mr Brady briefed Mr Lamont on Thursday after a trip to eastern Europe and
Moscow to assess progress with economic reform.
G7 finance ministers and central bankers will consider the latest world
economic forecasts from the International Monetary Fund, which are thought
to point to low global growth of about 1.5 per cent this year but a recovery
to 3.5 per cent in 1993. The US growth rate is also forecast to quicken to
around 3.5 per cent next year from about 1.5 per cent in 1992.
Monetary officials from the US and Europe expect that Japan will be asked at
the April 26 meeting to stimulate investment, perhaps by bringing forward
further public works programmes.
It is unclear how much more pressure the US will exert upon its other G7
allies to persuade them to revise their policies.
The US has expressed understanding for the economic difficulties arising
from German unification and it may not make a frontal attack on the
Bundesbank's high interest rates.
Russia's economic reform programme remains intact and the planned financial
support for it from the International Monetary Fund should be agreed in May,
according to Nicholas Brady, US Treasury secretary.
The US had not changed its support for the economic reform efforts or its
view that work on western financial support for Russia should continue, he
said.

FT  18 APR 92 / Travel: Journey by Batty Bus to whimsical Belize - The
easy-going ways of the Belizean reefs and cays entirely to his liking
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS WOODSWORTH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PORING OVER the pages of an atlas not long ago, I came across a country that
I immediately wanted to visit for no reason other than its names. It is a
tiny place, not much more than a spot on the map, but its names filled my
imagination.
Only a complete cynic could fail to see happy portents in the likes of Bound
To Shine and More Tomorrow. But what of ominous places like Pull-Trouser
Swamp, Burnt House, Go To Hell Camp? Would you prefer to live in Gallon Jug,
Baking Pot, or Tea Kettle? Imagine life on Dog Flea Cay - perhaps Cockroach
Cay would suit you better. What is Saturday night like in Dancing School
Eddy?
Any country with such whimsical and outlandish names, I thought, must be
worth a visit. It is. Belize is a whimsical, outlandish and satisfying
place.
While Belize has at least in theory taken its place among the modern,
independent and responsible nations of this world, I am not so sure it has
caught up with this world, or is even entirely part of it. The whole country
seems dottily misplaced. It functions, but in a wacky, improvised way. This
became apparent as soon as I stepped on to a Belizean bus in Chetumal, a
border town in the Mexican state of Quintana Roo.
To begin with, no one in his right mind who owns a bus company, even if his
surname is Batty, names it the Batty Bus Company. Nor does anyone normally
press a brand new, low-slung, low-geared city bus, the kind with seats
facing each other and straps for hanging, into long-haul service on tropical
jungle highways; it does not stay new for long.
Nonetheless, off we set on the Batty Bus to Belize City, the motor howling
as the driver put his foot to the floor and roared through the mangrove
swamps at 30 mph.
Not even the musical choice on board was entirely sane. Gone were the hot
and excited Latin rhythms one finds blaring over the speakers of Mexican
buses. Instead, whining our way southward through the muggy December
afternoon, we were accompanied by Bing Crosby in a mellow medley of
Christmas songs. 'Chestnuts roasting on an open fire . . . ', crooned Crosby
as we ground past coconut plantations and sweated into our shirts.
Not only the music, but my fellow passengers, too, seemed out of place. Here
we were in the heart of central America. To the north lay Mexico's Yucatan
peninsula, to the east Guatemala, to the south Honduras and El Salvador. For
1,000 miles in every direction this was an Hispanic region, a world of brown
skins, rapid Spanish inflections and excitable Latin temperaments.
Yet the people riding with me were more than a little relaxed, black, and
speaking English. Like a foreign ship aground, Belize seems to have drifted
into central America by accident, become stuck, and never left.
My impressions were only reinforced in Belize City, a place which, with
50,000 people, holds about one-third of the nation's population. If Belize,
the country, is a ship aground, Belize the city is already breaking up and
sinking.
Built on a swamp at the mouth of a sluggish creek, it stands only 18 inches
above sea level. Hot, steamy and odorous, flooded when rainy and
mosquito-ridden when windless, it seems just the place not to choose to
build a city. So unsuitable is it that the Belizean government has installed
itself in distant Belmopan. Ministers and bureaucrats are now lost far in
the jungles of the interior - at last safe, however, from the hurricanes
that periodically devastate the coast.
In an age of urban modernisation and blandness, Belize City has a certain
swash-buckling, picaresque appeal. There is little that is up-to-date,
well-maintained or efficient in it. Even the Mayan ruins rising from jungle
clearings in the interior seem better preserved. Its wooden houses and
shops, perched on stilts to avoid the worst humidity, are slowly crumbling.
Every year their clapboard sides grow more weather-beaten and peeled, their
tin roofs more rust-stained. What is the earthly fruit of man's vaunting
ambition? In the heat, dampness, corrosion and rot of Belize, not a great
deal.
In fact, if it were not for a certain Baron Bliss, an English
philanthropist, Belize City would have lost count of time altogether and
receded back into the primordial ooze. In a long history of colonial neglect
under the British crown, Bliss appears the only one to have cared for the
fate of Belize.
Today the city's most notable landmarks are the results of his beneficence -
the Bliss Institute, the Bliss school of nursing, the Bliss promenade, the
Bliss airport transit lounge, the Bliss lighthouse and the Bliss memorial
are only some of them. There is, naturally, a national Bliss Day every year
to celebrate the baron's generosity.
Belize's own home-grown vitality, if it exists anywhere, reposes in its
people, a true salad of genes. Hacked out of virgin forest nominally under
Spanish control, the country was in large part populated by African slaves
brought in to work British timber concessions.
But the English 'Baymen' and their black slaves were just part of the mix of
the colony then known as British Honduras. There were also indigenous Maya
Indians, Carib tribes from the seas to the east, immigrant Mexicans,
Garifunas - the offspring of Caribs and escaped slaves - indentured East
Indians and Mennonite settlers from Switzerland. Walk down a street in
Belize City today and you might find yourself as culturally confused as the
people who live there.
Where, in this great tropical hodge-podge, does the visitor to Belize find
his place? You might - like the British army units which still come to
post-independence Belize - practise jungle warfare deep in the interior
until you were destroyed by mosquitos. You could waste away in the bars of
Belize City until you were mugged by Rastafarians. Or, like most visitors,
you could head out to the cays for one of the most idyllic marine holidays
it is possible to enjoy anywhere.
Just a mile or two off the Belize coast lies the longest coral reef in the
western hemisphere, 250 kms of warm, crystal-clear Caribbean water,
colourful submarine life and the scattered small green islands known as
cays.
It is here that the Belizean penchant for relaxed, makeshift living reaches
the level of genius. You need not be efficient, time-conscious or even
vaguely formal on the cays. Such anti-social behaviour is even frowned upon
as a cramp to the island style of life - witness the sign on the wall of
most cay bars and restaurants: 'No shirt, no shoes, no problem.'
I spent a few days on Cay Caulker, a mile-long island an hour from Belize
City by fast boat. It is delightful. There is nothing out there to tax even
the most stressed brain. The soothing effect of living with sky, water,
leafy green island and not much else is immediate.
Suddenly, everyone begins enjoying life. Like Jack and Jake, a couple of
dried-out septuagenarian New York wise-crackers I met, you can spend all day
drinking rum punch and fishing for tarpon. Or, like Wendy, a Labour council
housing manager from London, you can put scuba tanks on your back, get away
from all those people, and sort out schools of fish instead. My own choice
was to spend long breezy days on Miss Conduct, a 32-ft wooden sailing boat
which, shared with three other people, cost me just Dollars 7 a day.
Lugging along beside the reef under patched canvas sails and a warm sun, it
seemed to me there was not much more one could ask from life. When we were
hungry we dropped anchor and fished for snapper. If we wanted lobster or the
firm white meat of the conch shell, we dived down and hunted for it. If we
felt like doing nothing, we did.
The easy-going ways of the cays are quickly adopted. In no time I felt
myself turning soft and lazy. One morning I told myself it was time to leave
Caulker and hurry back to the real world. But that evening, when the boat
returned, I met a bare-footed woman fishing from the dock. 'How many are you
going to catch', I asked as she pulled in three fish. She could have caught
a dozen, or six dozen, if she had wanted.
'Just enough for tea', she said. 'Fish always impatient to get caught.' She
coiled her hook and line. 'Don't do them no good, though.'
I thought that over. I would stay a little longer. The Batty Bus back to the
real world could wait.
There are no direct flights from the UK to Belize. Nicholas Woodsworth flew
to Belize City via Miami with American Airlines, which offers a return fare
of Pounds 508.
One reason why Belize tourism remains relatively undeveloped is its
capital's reputation for drug-related street crime, and care should be
exercised. Happily, such provisos apply only to Belize City.
There is not a great deal of travel literature on Belize. Perhaps the best
guide is the Belize Handbook, from Moon Publications.

FT  18 APR 92 / Travel: Doing the promenade - The sands at Deauville
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL WIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SAND at Deaville is tended like a garden.  The rubbish removal not
affected by the busy flocks of gulls is completed by early morning sweepers
and cleaners, brushing the wooden broadwalks, preparing the old wooden
blue-and-white beach huts.  The sea is the stage for surf-divers, idle
paddlers, the strongly-tanned women rhythmically performing their
breaststroke rites.
Promenading along the broadwalk is another rite, carried out by some ancient
Egyptian erectness and measured timing.  Dogs are fashion items: coats
trimmed, their top-knots tied in lacy bows, leads of special leather.  No
Deauville habitue would be seen dead carting a pooper-scooper, and typical
Gallic disdain for hygiene beneath the feet, pavements are plentifully
dog-fouled and the back streets have an acrid aroma.
For someone like me, unversed in Europe, the striking thing about this
corner of Normandy is how resolutely French it is.  By which I mean that
Americanisation has been avoided.  There is not T-shirt culture, no
amusement arcades, fast-food outlets, structural gigantism or
ghetto-blasters.  Deauville is a distillation of sensuous well-being -
middle-aged, studied, borne aloft in culinary refinement.
we dined in adjacent Trouville, another 19th century holiday resort sited on
a long sandy beach and designed for comtemplative relaxation by the seaside.
 Here the fishing boats enter a remarkably narrow channel at high tide, and
disgorge their wares on to the fish-slabs on the quay.  The fish has only to
cross the road to Trouville's main harbour-side street before being rendered
into edible form and eaten in a string of restaurants serving a choice of
inclusive menus at graded prices.
Normandy is famous for eating.  The activity is treated with reverence
disguised by brisk professionalism.  Previous training in French West Africa
had taught me that the appurtenances of fish soup - crusty toastlets, a
cheesy mayonnaise and piquant grated cheese - are assembled in a rough
vessel, then launched on the rich body of the soup before being scooped up
and swallowed whole.
I realised the first night out that my wife and I had strayed into an eating
culture with its own special rules whan a glamourous leotard-clad young
woman sporting a high engagement ring came and sat beside us and expertly
ransacked a large crab, cracking the claws wrapped in a napkin in her lap,
stopping towards the end only to order another.
With the help of a green salad and a glass of water, she then consumed a
third, before getting up and briskly trotting off.  For reasons not clear,
my wife explained this fastidious engorgement of crabmeat as reaction to a
row with her boyfriend.
It is strange, emerging from London, to walk a street with no foreign
restaurants.  Exotic restaurants, yes, foreign, no.  Kentucky Fried and
McDonalds may be scrambling into Murmansk and Petrograd, but their site
prospectors can cross Trouville and Deauville off the map.  Who would opt
for a Big Mac when a seafood started, costing the equivalent, is heaped with
more shellfish than have names?
Covertly, we craned round to see how the natives coped with some the these.
 The answer, with dexterous movements of specialised untensils, popping
little juicy shell-dwellers in between constantly working jaws. I was
surprised to see salmon on every menu and in the charcuteries and
fish-shops, seeing that France has almost no native stocks and they must be
flown from salmon farms in Britain or Norway.  But preparation is
everything, and the most ordinary lump of salmon pressed in aspic with an
egg and parsley takes on a new meaning.
Deauville and Trouville have become monuments to their pasts.  The new
buildings, even those which are four storeys high, are constructed in
traditional half-timbered style with pitched roofs.  The quantity of
honey-coloured hardwood adorning these facades made me wonder where it all
came from.  Whatever the source, the timber is being put to attractive use,
although now its function is ornamental, not structural.
The seafronts have an air of dilapidated gentility, reminscent of a grander
time when this seaview mansion shutters were open and the front lawns and
hedges clipped.  But it is a dilapidation never allowed to reach the point
of collapse.
The flaking paintwork, like Trouville's imperious but battered casino, are
all totems of style.  Style is more important here.  Even the assistant
trying to sell my wife a pair of shoes had developed a patter of extreme
politeness that would have had as its more suitable object glass slippers
rather than the objects actually under discussion.
Classicism is the order of the day, even at the fairground.  The speakers,
turned low, play classical pop from the 1960s.  There are no big dippers,
ghost trains, thrills and spills here.  A petite merry-go-round of
artistically-embellished helicopters and carriages was operated by a man
with a wrinkled brown face who also worked a rag-doll from the air on a
pulley, dropping within tantilising reach of delighted children as it
squiggled over their heads.
Art is never far away in France, and the Troville museum shows 19th century
oil paintings of the beach at the height of the season. Stripey beach tents
shivered on the sand, as they do still.
The time had come to leave, to board the ferry at Le Havre and cross the
water that separates two cultures with completely different orientations,
shortly to be linked by a tunnel.  A strange prospect, Not so strange,
though, as the head-long rush by returning British holidaymakers for the
plates of beans, soggy chips and half-hot sausages ladled out brusquely in
the ship's 'eatery.'

FT  18 APR 92 / Pity the lobster socialists - A plan to help wealthy Labour
voters carry on
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DOMINIC LAWSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE gloating must stop. There is nothing better than a good gloat, but all
good things must come to an end.
Those of us who supported the Conservatives in the election, even though we
were told that we were backing the losing team, and that we would be in the
dustbin of history, have had our moment of triumphalism. The time has now
come to unite the nation. In particular we must offer cheer and hope to
those of our acquaintance who voted Labour, so that they can face the next
five years with equanimity. Better that, or else our socialist friends of
more than slender means might join Vanessa and Colin in the Workers'
Revolutionary Party, and then civilised dinner party conversation would
become all but impossible.
It was in fact on election night itself that I felt the first pangs of pity
for the losers. The proprietor of The Spectator, Conrad Black, had thrown a
party at The Savoy (Champagne and Crustaceans 11pm to 4am RSVP); and while I
would be lying if I said that the dominant mood of the evening - after the
Basildon result came in - was not overwhelmingly triumphalist, there was
also a smattering of champagne and crustacean socialists present.
One could see the lobster turning to ashes in the mouth of these people and
one wanted to do something to cheer them up if only to make sure the Black
party went with more of a swing than that enjoyed by the Labour party.
Unfortunately I was too inebriated at the time to make coherent my sympathy
to those described by the French as gauche caviare. So perhaps here is the
place to do it, in the pages of a newspaper which also thought that we would
be better off under a Labour government.
Labour voters should first of all take heart that the Conservative share of
the poll was, at 41.9 per cent, exactly the same as it was in the 1966
general election, when Labour gained an overall majority of 98 seats. So
even if the Conservative share of the vote remains at this apparently
impressive level, all Labour has to do, is persuade former Labour voters who
now vote Liberal, that Paddy Ashdown is unelectable. That should not be
difficult.
In the meantime however, Labour voters, particularly those of substantial
means, must find a way of triumphing over Conservative greed and
self-centredness. There is a simple solution.
All my well-off Labour friends need to do is work out how much extra tax and
National Insurance contributions they would have paid under Neil Kinnock's
proposed government, and make it over to the Inland Revenue as a voluntary
contribution.
Some Labour voters might object on the grounds that their money might go to
further Conservative policy objectives - although they are mistaken if they
think that a Labour government would have paid their higher taxes, in some
hypothecated way, directly to the Department of Health and Social Security.
But such cynics need not pay their additional voluntary contributions
directly to the Treasury. They could donate their money to any National
Health Service hospital which has clearly stated that it will not become a
self governing trust, or to any state school which has decided not to opt
out of education authority control.
I know that many of my Labour-voting friends will object that the money
raised will be only a fraction of that pledged by John Smith in his Shadow
Budget. But it seems that about 20 per cent of those described by
advertising agencies as ABs, voted Labour, so the amount raised will not be
negligible either.
This voluntary tax is of course not designed purely for disappointed Labour
voters. The idea comes straight from the practice of Margaret Thatcher.
In all the years of her prime ministership she refused to take up her full
pay entitlement instead choosing to take only the amount paid to every other
Cabinet minister. In this way the Treasury retained about Pounds 250,000, to
spend on the beneficiaries of government aid. Will the Labour well-to-do be
as charitable as the former prime minister? Or will they give the rest of us
reason to start gloating all over again?

FT  18 APR 92 / Private View: The nine lives of Chaim Herzog
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTIAN TYLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A CORPORAL was taking the names of a batch of new recruits at an infantry
barracks in Maidstone, Kent, in the early days of the Second World War. He
stopped in front of a young volunteer.
'Name?'
'Herzog', said the young man, in a distinct Dublin accent.
'First name?'
'Chaim.'
The corporal swore. 'What the hell's that?'
'That's Hebrew, corporal.'
'We don't 'ave no 'Ebrew round 'ere. This is the British Army.'
'But that's my name. What am I supposed to do about it?'
Another recruit intervened: Chaim means Life, he said, and the English name
would be Vivien.
'Right,' said the corporal. 'From now on you're Vivien and we'll have no
******* Hebrew in the British Army.'
To his wife and friends, 'Vivien' is what the president of Israel has been
ever since. He finished the anecdote, dropped his Cockney impersonation and
exclaimed in his own gentle Irish accent: 'It could only happen in England]'
That was how Chaim Herzog, the rabbi's son, born in Belfast and raised in
Dublin, became a British major and embarked on the first of his nine lives -
from soldier to businessman, broadcaster, diplomat, historian, pilot,
politician and elder statesman.
At 73, Herzog is old enough to remember the violent birth of the two states,
Ireland and Israel, which sit alphabetically adjacent at the UN table. As a
child he saw shooting in the streets outside the house in Dublin where his
father Isaac, chief rabbi of the small Jewish community, frequently
entertained Eamon de Valera, future head of the republic.
When he was 18 he acquired his own rifle in the Jewish underground, the
Haganah, during the Arab revolt of 1936-8, the family having emigrated to
Palestine for Herzog Senior's appointment as chief rabbi there.
When you meet the Israeli president, as I did in Jerusalem last week, it is
the Irishman that you notice first. And it was as such that I began to
address him. Herzog corrected me.
'You can't call me an Irishman. But I have imbibed a lot. I honestly believe
that if there's anybody who should really understand us, given the
circumstances in which we're living, then it should be the Irish.'
The parallels between the two nations are compelling, as Conor Cruise
O'Brien (who, like Herzog, was once his country's ambassador to the UN) has
written. Religion is one obvious connection. So I asked the rabbi's son if
he regretted the loss of faith among Israeli Jews.
'No, I regret the loss of the bridge we had between religious and secular.'
He described how the demise of the National Religious Party had allowed the
ultra-Orthodox, whose disproportionate political power is resented by many
non-religious Jews, to fill the vacuum.
How would you put yourself on the religious spectrum?
'I'm an observing Jew, but I wouldn't say I am extreme in any way. I find
myself at home with everybody. In this job I have to be - with Jew, Arab,
Christian or Druze, even with the extreme religious elements.
Is religious sectarianism in Northern Ireland a warning parallel for Israel?
'I don't think there is anything as bitter as a religious war, and that's
what you've got today in Northern Ireland. I've done my best in my period of
office to prevent that happening here. Here there's a lot more commonsense.'
Israel's unending conflict with the Palestinians and the Arab states (that
is, apart from Egypt) was due to lack of leadership on the other side, not
religion, Herzog said. Islamic fundamentalism was a growing threat but that
was problem for many countries other than Israel.
As he spoke, the windows were rattled as if by some distant explosion.
The presidency has become politically a great deal more delicate as the
Israeli electorate has moved to the Right: in his nine years at the helm
Herzog has had to stitch together six precarious governments and may be
called upon to do so again after the general election in June.
I tried to discover whether Herzog, a former Labour member of the Knesset,
had himself moved to the Right over the years. Did you imbibe socialism as a
youth in Ireland? I asked.
'No, not necessarily. My late father always maintained that true socialism
was preached in the Bible. He used to classify himself as a socialist but
based on the philosophy of the Bible, not of Marx.'
You have the reputation of being a right-winger on questions like
settlements in the occupied territories, I said.
Herzog countered that he had never made his views known and would not do so
now. But he went on:
'There is a tendency to be facile about this issue. One of the great
problems of the West is they don't understand the Middle East. I've said
this on many occasions. To say settlements are an obstacle to peace is not
borne out by the facts.'
Like many Israelis, Herzog has spent much of his life in uniform. He joined
the British Army from Cambridge University. He fought in Normandy, saw the
Bergen-Belsen concentration camp after its liberation and encountered the SS
commander Heinrich Himmler before his suicide.
After World War Two and training for the English Bar, he became the first
head of Israeli military intelligence and rose through various commands to
the rank of major-general. Retiring from regular service he went into
business, and for ten years was managing director of GUS Industries. But in
June 1967, he rode into Jerusalem as the first military governor of the West
Bank.
I asked him whether Israel's preoccupation with its own security had not
left its leaders unable to address the problems of peace.
'No. It's been somewhat miraculous here. We are an entire nation in the
military and yet we are the least militant country that I know. Nobody likes
it. Everybody sees it as a necessary evil, to guarantee our future. No more.
There's no spit and polish. You don't seen any plumes and medals here.'
I thought of the dishevelled soldiers I had seen patrolling the Gaza Strip
four years ago, of the tear-gas raids on hospitals, the alleged beatings of
children in detention. I asked: As a military man, doesn't the indiscipline
concern you?
'I do speak out on issues of discipline. I'm going soon to visit Gaza - so
I'll be able to tell you then.' The president smiled benignly. 'But look at
eastern Europe. Look at Yugoslavia and then at our experience. We've done
not so bad.
'Our problem is to maintain a situation in which you can negotiate without
it deteriorating into another Beirut or Yugoslavia.'
But what about those soldiers who lose their cool completely?
'Why don't you ask the people that send their children out to fight? When a
child threw a Molotov cocktail at a bus in Jericho a few years ago and a
Jewish mother and her three children were burnt to death, she was no less
dead because the bomb had been thrown by a child.
'I'm not saying that everything is delightful. It's a difficult situation
and unfortunate things happen. But we have courts and the Arabs do go to the
courts. And the courts on more than one occasion have called the Israel
authorities to book.' (The president did not mention his controversial
commuting of sentences on Israelis convicted of murdering Arabs.)
Outsiders find it difficult to reconcile the idealism of Israel's early
pioneers with today's Right-wing expansionism. I asked Herzog whether he
himself found modern Israel an unfamiliar place.
'We tend to idealise the past and to look back on it with nostalgia. But the
fact is, nobody ever dreamt that we would achieve what we have. I think with
all the shortcomings - and I don't hesitate to talk about them - we have
very much to be proud of.'
Your supporters abroad complain that the world requires higher standards of
Israel than of any other country.
'I've often said that myself, but the fact is we have a high standard and we
ought to be proud of it and maintain it - and we do. As I say, the courts
are open. There's a free press here. We've lived under this threat of
terrorism all these years and we haven't hanged a single terrorist. Not
one.' Herzog recalled being provoked in the Council of Europe recently by a
British Labour MP.
'I began to compare our behaviour towards the Palestinians with the British
government's behaviour towards the IRA. And believe me, if he could blush,
he did blush.
'I told him nobody of the IRA can appear on TV or radio in Britain. Here you
can see an interview with Arafat and his people on the TV any night. And we
certainly did not ambush unarmed people, including a woman, as they did in
Gibraltar.
'So my advice to all those who criticise us is to look in their own back
garden first.'
Chaim Herzog's two-term tenure of the presidency expires soon. He says he
will not go back into politics.
What ambitions do you have left?
'I wouldn't mind if I got a hole-in-one playing golf. Seriously, I would
like to continue what I do. I fly light planes, I play golf, I sail. Really,
I would like to go back to what I was doing before, which is writing. I have
so much to write.'

FT  18 APR 92 / Despatches: Battle to save the condor - Bogota
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARITA KENDALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE MIGHTY Andean condor has inspired songs, stories and even worship for
more than 2,000 years. Swooping, gliding and soaring over high plains and
craggy peaks, it is a symbol of power that adorns national coats of arms.
But the condor is an endangered species, fast disappearing from the northern
Andes. None has been seen in Venezuela for several years, there are only 40
in Colombia and fewer than 100 in Ecuador.
Now, the world's biggest flighted bird is getting help from an unexpected
source: the Bogota and Quito city water companies. Anxious to preserve what
remains of the vegetation on Andean watersheds, they are teaming up with
environmental organisations to protect the condor's haunts.
'There is a strong local commitment from the private and the public sectors
to save one of the most important areas for bio-diversity in the world,'
says Gregory Miller, of the Nature Conservancy.
This US-based organisation has declared a 1.6m-acre 'Condor bio-reserve' on
the eastern Andes of Ecuador, and also supports Colombia's Chingaza Natural
Park where nine condors raised in the San Diego zoo in the US have been
released. When the first five - all male  - were taken to Chingaza, they
could barely fly. Gradually, they increased their range to 50 kilometres or
more, always returning to a feeding platform high above a water reservoir
where dead animals are left for them. Four females were released a few
months ago, and now all nine - still with the immature brown plumage which
will eventually give way to black and white feathers - can be seen circling
over the platform when hungry.
Immensely curious, condors often fly too close to humans for their own
safety. At Chingaza, human contact is strictly forbidden, but transmitters
fixed to the birds' huge wings allow biologists to keep track of them. The
males fly together in a group but the females range off in different
directions - mating begins only when the birds are about six years old.
As the condors fly further afield over populated areas, they could be
heading into danger. Many peasants believe the birds are all too ready to
swoop down on a chicken or calf and carry it off. But their strength lies in
their beaks (for tearing at carrion) rather than their claws. Unfortunately,
their 10ft wingspan makes an easy target.
Friedemann Koster, a zoologist living on the outskirts of Quito, is looking
after two young condors in his back garden. One was shot down and both had
been badly treated in captivity before they were brought to him. 'People are
the threat for these birds,' he says.
Andean condors have retreated to the heights, apparently to escape hunters.
But the decimation of wild animals on the high plains has left them with
little food. Experts agree that the giant vulture might now be driven to
eating placenta and newborn calves, and that this has turned farmers against
them. In 1990, seven condors were found dead on Mount Antisana, east of
Quito in the bio-reserve.
'One of the condors was sent to a laboratory for analysis and they found it
had been poisoned - a dead bullock had been put out with rat poison in it.
There was another similar case when five condors died,' says Mauricio
Guerrero, of the Ecuadorean Ornithological Corporation. 'We began a campaign
to save the condor, and the president declared it a national symbol.'
Condor folklore is not as strong in the northern Andes as it is in Peru and
Bolivia, where the bird is more common: one Peruvian ritual involves a fight
between a condor (symbolising the Indian) and a bull (representing the
Spaniard). The legend of the young shepherdess carried off by a condor to
its clifftop nest is common all through the Andes. In some versions, the
girl turns into a condor; in others, she gives birth to a strange creature
and returns home, shamed.
In one of the villages on the lower slopes of Antisana, there is now an
ecological group called Friends of the Condor. Members have been helping
with studies on the birds and they may in future work as guides for people
visiting the bio-reserve.
The Antisana Foundation is preparing a management plan for the watershed
there, with the support of the Nature Conservancy. 'It includes the
protection of natural areas, eco-tourism, community education, sustainable
harvest activities - fisheries, wildlife and agro-forestry - and research,'
Miller explains.
The water companies are also keen to find ways to combine conservation with
other benefits; tourism is one, environmental education another. Buses full
of students and schoolchildren visit Chingaza each week, and it is one of
the few Colombian natural parks that generates income. But some economic
activities, such as sheep and cattle grazing, will have to be curtailed. The
Bogota water company employees spend weeks each summer putting out fires
started by farmers who want to extend the pasture available for their
animals. 'The condor is catching on as a symbol,' said one blackened
firefighter at Chingaza. 'Maybe it will help people realise where their
water comes from.'

FT  18 APR 92 / Hawks &amp; Handsaws: Murder scandal golf
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL THOMPSON-NOEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HOW NICE, now that the UK election is over, to get back to a normal daily
intake of murder, mystery, mayhem, scandal, sex, golf, recipes and
post-feminism, and to reflect that no-one who lives and votes in Britain
need scan or ingest a single wacky story about polls or politicians for at
least a couple of years - until murder, mystery, mayhem, scandal, sex and
golf wreak implacable havoc in the constituencies and we are cast, like
gnomes down a well, into a fresh round of election madness.
Not that I didn't enjoy the election. I am not one of those people who finds
elections boring, or argues that there is nothing to choose between the
parties anyway. Yet even my patience can be tested to collapse by newspaper
editors' penchant for poll-based punditry.
Which is why I have spent the past few days luxuriating in the discovery
that there is life beyond elections - that there are things going on, just
as they always have, in a fluttery, whimsical dance towards the end of time.
Take sport. I expect you thought that the clamour of the UK election was so
great that something as intrinsically silly and marginal as horse racing had
quietly folded its tents and stolen into the night, never to be heard from
again. Not a bit of it. On and on it goes: hundreds of races daily,
trillions' worth of bets, all of it conveyed to readers of the sportspages
in the special lackey-prose in which horserace-writers have to sit a degree
before the Jockey Club allows them on to a racecourse. Henry Cecil, the
famed Newmarket trainer? You thought he had expired? Gone to a higher
pasture? Not a bit of it. He is still winning races, just as he did at the
start of his career in 1836.
Golf? You thought that golf had quietly died? Absolutely not. In Georgia, a
man called Fred Couples won the Masters last weekend and is apparently set
fair to become 'the first truly dominant American golfer since Tom Watson',
whoever he was. Cricket? I am afraid so. Rugby? But of course. Soccer?
Badminton? Gymnastics? Snooker? Speedway? Squash? Utterly and absolutely. In
fact, more than there was before.
Another commodity surfing through the newspapers in greater and greater
quantities than anyone can recall is sex. On Thursday I bought the Mail,
Express, Sun, Star, Today, Mirror and Sport. They were awash. What priceless
comics they are, especially the first three. I won't quote specifics,
because journalists on posh papers who entertain their readers with synopses
of mucky stories from the comics are generally accused of voyeurism, which
is not something to relish.
But the sap is rising fast, and is seeping into the qualities, especially
into The Times, a paper I admire. On Wednesdays it runs a column by Lynne
Truss called Single Life, which is probably doing more to inflame the
circulation of The Times than 1,000 columns of punditry by tiresome Peter
Riddell.
This week, the wonderful Ms Truss was writing about the onset of warmer
weather and how it affects her mind, especially when confronted by 'blokes
with squeegees who haunt the traffic lights at Vauxhall Cross . . . They
are, I fancy, generated out of the swirling grit of Vauxhall by the mystical
action of the sun, like crocodiles from the mud of the Nile.'
As you know, I am related to all the Fleet Street editors. The next time one
of them asks me how to infuse his publication with sap and vitality, I shall
tell him to cut his number of political columnists to one, purge his payroll
of in-house intellectuals, cancel his market research contract, dispense
with bleary polls, forget about elections - and ponder the words of Ms
Truss, who has more bubbles than Perrier and is the sort of writer editors
will have to woo and flatter if they hope to steer their publications over
the reefs of media fragmentation (more and more titles chasing increasingly
specialised readerships) without splintering like matchwood.
For good cheer, though, nothing could equal an editorial in Thursday's Mail,
which read in part:
'Oh to be in Britain now that April's here and the election is over.
'Birds are nest-building. Househunters are eyeing the estate agents' windows
with new, predatory enthusiasm. And, despite the continuing economic chill,
there is an unmistakable scent of recovery in the air . . .'
It's a pity they haven't heard about that asteroid careering towards Earth.

FT  18 APR 92 / Arts: Maniacal iconoclast of film convention / Nigel Andrews
talks to the Danish film director Lars Von Trier about his latest film,
Europa - Screen
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIGEL ANDREWS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SAY 'Danish cinema' to most cinephiles and their eyes glaze over. They think
of farming families pounding butter in Nordic Technicolor or grim,
impenetrable tales of 17th century religious persecution in black-and-white.
Yet director Lars Von Trier had a different, de-glazing effect on last
year's Cannes prize night audience. He won two awards for his spectacular
film Europa and even these, it was clear, were not enough for Denmark's new
Wunderkind. The first prize for Superior Technique he disdainfully handed to
a colleague saying 'He has worked on all my films and is very technical'.
For the second, grander Prix Du Jury he thanked 'the midget', by which we
all realised with a shock that he was referring to jury president Roman
Polanski.
But what would you expect from a man whose movies - from the Borgesian
thriller The Element Of Crime to the Nazi-era film noir Europa opening in
Britain this week - place a bomb under film convention? Not since Citizen
Kane, has more maniacal fun been had with cinema's visual possibilities.
Multiple exposure, colour mixed with monochrome, 3D deep-focus effects,
cameras passing through solid objects, back-projected dream images. . .
'I don't like Citizen Kane,' insists Von Trier in a sunny Cannes garden. 'I
like Welles very much, but Citizen Kane is too obvious. I prefer The Lady
From Shanghai and Touch Of Evil.'
But he clearly shares Welles's 'best ever train set' view of cinema. Indeed
Von Trier has a different analogy. 'I am a simple masturbator of the
cinema,' he told one bemused French reporter. Meaning? 'The only thing I
have in mind when I make a film is my own enjoyment.'
He also enjoys kidding people along: not just interviewers but audiences.
Europa winds us up with its violations of stylistic orthodoxy and also with
its plot about an idealistic American (Jean-Marc Barr) arriving in Germany
after the war and falling in love with a beautiful Nazi sympathiser.
The terrorist group called the 'Werewolves', who carry the Third Reich flame
into acts of postwar sabotage, are depicted with alarming sympathy. In
Cannes a well-known left-wing daily viciously attacked the film.
'Liberation, which supported me before, was quite negative about Europa.
This was an expensive multi-country co-production, so they don't like the
commercial aspect. But also they think I am siding with the Nazis, which I
am not. The film is seen through Leo's (the hero's) eyes: the Germans are
victims at the beginning, but by the end that has changed. We had a joke,
though, that I would win the Iron Cross for the film]'
People have been shot for jokes like that. Still, Europa's provocateur
political postures are half its fun. The other half is its delirious
mise-en-scene. 'The camera moves were so elaborate we had to plan and
storyboard almost the whole film. The shooting script was 1,000 pages long.
The whole film was made in the studio, except for some Polish location
scenes we used for backgrounds.
'Some of the shots which look impossible, like the camera going down through
two floors to the bathroom where a man cuts his wrists, were quite easy. We
used dissolves that the audience can't see. But some difficult shots were
done for real.
'When the camera passes out from the attic room through the roof of the
house and then into a train passing by, that we actually did.
'Also we used a lot of back-projection, because I love the way Hitchcock
used it in films like Vertigo. Back-projection creates a dreamlike effect
because it's so unreal. It divides the image into different layers, which in
Europa we exaggerated by using colour and black-and-white.
When we wrote the script we spelled it out in terms of 'close-ups', 'long
shots' and so on. And whenever we used colour we called it a 'super
close-up'.'
The film has conjuring tricks a-plenty, but also real magic. Most of all in
its weirdly satisfying pot-pourri of influences, from British TV (Von Trier
stole the post-WW2 'innocent abroad' idea from A Family At War) to Franz
Kafka. Europa's humour, especially the scenes in which two eccentric railway
examiners put the train-guard hero through his paces, is pure Kafka.
'I love Kafka. He was a great infuence on my other films and I chose the
title of Europa as an echo of Amerika. It's really the same story told in
reverse. This time the innocent American comes to Europe. He enters a chaos
of different lives, different traditions, loyalties and opinions, which I
think is the charm of Europe.'
Seeing Europa, with its marriage between (almost) traditional plot and
go-for-broke stylistic experiment, one realises how visually tame most
feature films are. 'Cinema is so expensive, that's why it's so
conservative,' says Trier. 'At the beginning of the pop promo era, I was
very hopeful. I thought film was becoming more experimental and that this
would feed through into mainstream cinema. That hasn't happened. Today you
still sell a feature film on its story, whereas a rock video can be sold on
its images.'
Trier is about to take another bash at the frontiers of convention. His next
project is an epic thriller which will be shot over 22 years. 'I wanted to
do a 'monument'. We can't afford Lawrence Of Arabia, so it's a crime story
that will end in 2024] I can tell you what the first scene is, because we're
shooting it today. It's Eddie Constantine helicoptering over Cannes and
delivering a parcel to Udo Keir, who's waiting in a Mercedes. We haven't
decided what's in the parcel, so we're shooting with five different parcels.
Oh here they come now]' (Enter man bearing parcels).
'We don't know the ending yet, but I can tell you the first line. Eddie
Constantine says 'This will be my last delivery.' That's all I can tell you.
Now I must go.'

FT  18 APR 92 / Arts: Spoils of reconquista and jihad - An exhibition of
Islamic Art in Granada
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICIA MORISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FIVE hundred years ago Al Abdallah, last Muslim ruler in Spain, meekly
handed the kingdom of Granada over to the Christians and slunk off to exile
in North Africa with his mother's reproach ringing in his ears: 'Weep like a
woman; you have not defended your kingdom like a man'.
Generations of travellers, ravished by the beauty of the Alhambra, have
understood why Al Abdallah would have wept. The Nasridi rulers' palace is
the most intact and satisfying monument of Islamic secular architecture to
have survived in Andalusia. Now, for the first time, the palace has become
the setting for an exhibition: Al-Andalus. The Islamic Arts of Spain.
For this exceptional event, artefacts have been brought from museums and
cathedral treasuries throughout Spain and abroad - from libraries in Cairo
and Istanbul, from collections in the US, St Petersburg and Copenhagen, and
from mosques in Fez and Rabat.
Made over a period of seven and a half centuries, between the establishment
of the Ummayad caliphate at Cordoba and the final triumph of los reyos
catolicos, these luxury objects include some of the most notable
masterpieces of Islamic medieval art.
There is one big problem about this glamorous show, a joint venture between
the Alhambra and the Metropolitan Museum of New York. In theory, these
objects should be more at home here than at any time in the past five
centuries. They are disposed around rooms of legendary beauty, covered with
classic makkarnas or stalactite plasterwork, with ceilings of inlaid wood
and the Nasridi's carved reminders that 'There is no conqueror but Allah'.
In practice, the exhibition fights with its setting. Display-cases and
panels have been shoe-horned into the sultan's apartments, half-obscuring
tiled walls and filigree stuccowork, blocking niches. In the first important
room the visitor enters, the Mexuar or council-chamber, the walls are hidden
behind huge photographs of the interior of the Great Mosque of Cordoba. Such
an intrusion seems unnecessary, even in the interests of evoking a century
which has left us so little in the way of museum-pieces. No one with the
slightest interest in Spain's Islamic heritage is going to miss seeing
Cordoba for themselves. Conversely, anyone who makes their first visit to
the Alhambra during the next two months will surely resent finding the
palace's legendary rooms chopped about by designers.
Of all buildings in the world, none is more dependent on a prospect, namely
the dazzlingly lovely panorama of Granada and the Sierra Nevada, which the
Nasridi's architects knew to exploit so skilfully. But in order to turn the
Salon de los Embajadores, the sultan's audience room, into a darkened
gallery, all the window arches have been blocked.
In case the Alhambra's administration has a mind to repeat this experiment,
the point should to be made forcefully. Al-Andalus might just pass, in the
hullaballoo of Spain's triple-centenary year - the fall of Granada, the
expulsion of the Jews, and Columbus. But it represents the victory of
museological chic over aesthetic good manners.
And yet, even in the Salon de los Embajadores, it is hard to lament
over-long in the presence of stunning masterpieces of the 10th and 11th
Centuries, created in the workshops of the caliphs and later of the Taifa,
or successor, kings. The ivory boxes, the lustred bowls, silk textiles and
metalwork, look sumptuous and that makes just the right point about the
heyday of Arab rule in Spain.
Theirs was a brilliant civilization, a fact historians have always
recognized and which was abundantly obvious to Spain's medieval neighbours.
In the time of Caliph Abd al-Rahman III, who gave his daughter the
delightful ivory gaming-box we see, the princelings and knights of the
Christian north and southern France, wanted nothing so much as to lay hands
on the inlaid saddles, gilded candelabra, silks, wickedly sharp swords, and
Arab stallions of the Saracens.
The massive silver-gilt casket of Caliph Hisham II from the treasury of
Gerona cathedral, was probably given by the counts of Urgel or Barcelona,
recruited shortly after the millenium by the caliph's governor in return for
all the booty they could capture.
The Pamplona casket of carved ivory, with its wonderful scenes of court
life, hunting, and date-picking, was commissioned at the same date to
celebrate the Muslim conquest of Leon.
From further afield, too, the spoils of reconquista and jihad have been
reunited. Around 1100, the citizens of Pisa saw a winged monster put on top
of their cathedral, where it remained until 1828.
Tradition has it that the Pisa Griffon, a stolid beast the size of a foal,
was looted at the conquest of the Balearics. As with the Lion of Venice,
scholars dispute where the monster originated - Islamic it certainly is, and
perhaps a fountain decoration, but was it made in Egypt, Iran, North Africa,
or Andalusia?
When Muslims had the upper hand, they would carry off church bells and
convert them into mosque lamps: two beautiful examples, temporarily stripped
of their electric light-bulbs, have been borrowed from the Qarawiyyan Mosque
in Fez.
Certain exhibits will be seen only in New York, such as the minbar (pulpit)
of the Kutubiyya Mosque in Marrakesh. In Granada, the textiles are also
considerably reduced. Never mind, what we do see is simply marvellous, such
as the red silk used to line the reliquary casket of a Visigothic saint, St
Millan.
From the last days of Nasrid rule survives exquisite armour and, as part of
a cardinal's pickings, a great curtain such as might have draped the
sultan's chamber. The exhibition catalogue gives an engrossing account of
the splendour of court-culture at Cordoba, Medina al-Zara, and Granada.
My recommendation for Spain's quincentenary would be to visit Granada and
then, armed with the catalogue and Michael Jacobs's excellent Guide to
Andalusia (Penguin), to set out on a dogged search for the not-quite
vanished splendours of Islamic Spain.
Sponsored by Banco Bilbao Vizcaya. In Granada, to 7 June. At the
Metropolitan Museum of Modern Art, New York, 30 July to 27 September.

FT  18 APR 92 / Arts: Unrealised promise of Schnittke's Idiot / Review of
the premier of an opera which brings together four remarkable Russians
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAX LOPPERT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ALFRED Schnittke is the living Russian composer with the widest world
following. The honour of mounting his first opera, Life with an Idiot, has
gone to the Netherlands Opera at the Muziektheater in Amsterdam, a city with
strong Schnittke allegiances.
Opening night was undoubtedly a big occasion on the 1992 opera calendar. It
was also an evening of powerful exhilaration and disturbance, fascinating
and unsatisfying at one go. The age of glasnost is long established, yet
there was still something peculiarly affecting about the collaboration of
four remarkable Russian artists who only a decade ago were all victims of
the Soviet regime.
Schnittke himself was long considered a musical dissident; the 1980 novella
by Victor Yerofeyev on which the opera is based (and for which Yerofeyev
himself wrote the libretto) was a samizdat publication; Boris Pokrovsky, the
Moscow veteran responsible for the Amsterdam staging, spent a long period of
forced exile in the Russian artistic wilderness; and the sufferings of
Mstislav Rostropovich, the conductor, are well known.
With foreknowledge of the common factors linking the team, one was bound to
scan Life with an Idiot for tokens of political comment, satire, allegory.
And in truth, these were not hard to find, especially since Pokrovsky chose
to underline them - above all by presenting the Idiot of the title as an
obvious Lenin caricature. Yet at a first encounter the whole proved too
elusive for any tidy critical response. The ideal audience for this zany
farce streaked with angry melancholy would obviously be a metropolitan
Russian one directly responsive to the sung words, alert to all the
social-protest overtones; even after an advance reading of the libretto, and
with occasional help from the Dutch surtitles, the non-Russian-speaking
spectator was placed at a considerable disadvantage.
Three main characters - the university-lecturer protagonist ('I'), his wife,
and Vova the idiot - weave the plot, while the chorus alternately comments
on and adds detail to the narrative. For some unspecified offence against
the Party, 'I' must undergo the (relatively lenient) punishment of sharing
his small apartment with an asylum patient. But Vova turns out to be far
from the sweet old man he first seemed. 'Ech]', the single sound he proves
capable of uttering, develops into a war cry as in successive stages he
wrecks the couple's possessions and their marriage. Having in turn slept
with both, he escapes, leaving the wife murdered and 'I' ready for asylum
committal himself.
Schnittke's and Yerofeyev's echt-Russian brand of comedy is descended from
Gogol and, more directly, from Shostakovich's Gogol opera, The Nose. Indeed,
Shostakovich's stirring-together of parodied popular numbers and more
complex voice-and-chorus combinations provides the key to Schnittke's score.
A parallel can also be drawn between Vova's ever-expanding one-word cry, a
rich source of amusement throughout the evening, and the vocalise given to
the ape dressed as an aristocrat in Henze's Der junge Lord.
But in its go-for-broke switches and risk-everything contrasts of musical
tone - Old Russian, folk-Russian, joke-Viennese, cod 18th-century, high
coloratura sallies for the Wife - the total is pure Schnittke. Many of his
most ambitious concert-works have been music-theatre conceptions, in effect
if not in name; a full fleshing-out of the theatrical dimension is in many
ways an answer to a long-posed Schnittke question.
Some typically Schnittkeresque diversions are here included: at one point
Rostropovich abandons his baton for the piano part in a tango band, at
another he picks up his cello and essays a delicately mournful
waltz-meditation. As part of a larger dramatic pattern the jokes come off,
brilliantly.
The problem is an unevenness of parts. Act 1, bursting with raw vitality, is
followed by a second act much more attenuated and less striking in musical
invention. How far Schnittke's bad health was responsible it would be
impertinent to speculate; but I came away from the first performance longing
for the work to be slimmed down, sharpened in focus.
Even during Pokrovsky's deliciously picaresque production, with instrument
groups disposed on far balconies and choruses marching madly up the theatre
aisles, the feeling of huge promise unrealised grew ever greater. This is no
criticism of the Amsterdam performance, admirably committed, and least of
all of the three Americans leading the cast: the baritone Dale Duesing,
tireless as 'I', the soprano Teresa Ringholz, a sweetly appealing Wife, and
the tenor Howard Haskin, wonderfully dotty (and quite unrecognisable) as

FT  18 APR 92 / Arts: Off The Wall - Welcome to the House of Fun
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
DAVID MELLOR, the new Minister for Fun, has quickly got into the spirit of
his new job by disappearing on holiday. He has left behind hundreds of
miserable civil servants who might or might not be drafted into his Ministry
for the National Heritage, and an arts world wracked with uncertainty.
One nice problem - apart from where the 350 staff will be housed - is the
status of poor Charles Henderson, who currently heads the arts bureaucracy
but who is not high enough up the Civil Service hierarchy to rate Permanent
Secretary status. And Mellor's job demands a PS. For years the Office of
Arts and Libraries has been a pleasant backwater, no place to forge a great
career. Quickly changing this state of affairs could be a vital, but
unglamorous, task confronting Mellor.
One thing seems certain: most of the decisions - on arts funding, on the
future of broadcasting, on sport, on what national treasures should be be
exported, on whether the British film industry has a future, on the nature
and scope of the national lottery, and on the gigantic celebrations for the
millennium, will be taken directly by Mellor.
He might in theory be a supporter of the arm's length principle of arts
funding but his temperament will make him a hands-on Minister. His love of
publicity, and inclination to stir things up, will be given full rein. He
will always be popping up in the media, the UK's fleshy answer to France's
urbane Jack Lang, who achieved national notoriety as a high profile Minister
of Culture.
To general amazement there will be no specialist junior ministers looking
after the arts, or sport, just Robert Key, enthusiastic chorister and lover
of Queen, the band rather than the Monarch, who in theory shares the
decision making. But in those whirlwind few weeks in 1990, when Mellor was
Arts Minister, what was most striking was his insistence on getting involved
in the minutiae of the job, on how much money was destined for what theatre
group, or orchestra (especially if the orchestra was the LPO on which he had
been a board member). His attitude was clear cut - I'm supplying the money
and I want a say in where it is going.
And supply the money he did. In a sharp elbowed dig at the outgoing Arts
Minister Tim Renton this week, the chairman of the Arts Council, Lord
Palumbo, thanked Mellor, rather than Renton, for forcing the Treasury to
give the Council a generous grant increase for 1992-93. Mellor also found
the Pounds 10m the Government gave towards the ENO's purchase of its
freehold at the Coliseum.
So at last the arts has a powerful voice, sitting in the cabinet alongside a
Prime Minister who also believes that the spiritual well being of the people
is as important as the material. It was John Major who dreamed up the
European Festival, to be announced later this month. This should be a good
decade for the cultural life of the country.
But there are bound to be rows. Mellor is basically sympathetic to the BBC
so it might secure its new charter for the loss of Radios One and Two to
commercial advertising. It seems likely that the film industry's plea for
tax concessions will be accepted at last.
For the arts generally, the Arts Council's pet project, a 'National Arts
Strategy', will be allowed to emerge this summer before any dramatic
decisions are taken. Mellor was not totally committed to local arts funding
when Minister - and he may well jib at the LPO being delegated from Arts
Council funding to the care of the London Arts Board, as is planned. This
could influence his approach to the whole devolution bandwagon: the Arts
Council may now survive with only slightly diminished authority. Mellor, who
gets along well with Palumbo, seems to have bought the idea of a millennium
binge in the year 2000, with all Britain's museums, cathedrals, opera
houses, made ship shape for the new century.
And where is the money to come from to pay for all this fun? All eyes turn
to the national lottery which could prove to be the most contentious and
disillusioning experience of the decade. Estimates of the money it will
produce - from Pounds 400m to over Pounds 1bn - range almost as wildly as
the causes it may help. The arts, heritage, and sport have always been the
front runners but the temptation to divert money to health and education
will be difficult to stop. Even if the arts receive Pounds 200m this will
scarcely be enough to repair every museum, keep every Pounds 10m Canaletto
in the UK, and purchase such necessaries as a national dance house.
Oddly enough the Foundation for Sport and the Arts, another of John Major's
ideas, which was promoted, and part financed, by the football pool companies
in a vain bid to stave off competition from a lottery, is quickly proving
itself a cheap, British, alternative that seems to work.
The Pounds 20m plus the Foundation gives to the arts each year is patching
up the arts fabric of the nation: Pounds 2m for the Coliseum; Pounds 300,000
for Blackheath Concert Hall; Pounds 3m to save the old Ealing Studios. The
RSC could be the next beneficiary. Mellor will have to fix very firm
guidelines for the Lottery if it is to match the work of the Foundation.

FT  18 APR 92 / Arts (Radio): Annie Lennox tells all
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BA YOUNG
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT WAS Ladies' Week across the channels last weekend. On Radio 1 on
Saturday, Annie Lennox 'told all'; we heard about her baby, but most of
'all' concerned her new album, Diva, and her old albums, when she was half
of The Eurhythmics. Radio 2, also on Saturday, presented the immortal Joyce
Grenfell, who had more to talk about and talked better - however she talked,
for she had a great repertory of English voices, despite being brought up in
America. She was my next-door neighbour in Chelsea, where her assimilated
English everyday voice could suggest any one of her stage voices as
necessary.
And late on Monday, Radio 4 had Adelaide Hall in the first of six
programmes. I can recall her from the 20s, a Broadway star, later a Paris
cabaret star. Electronics works miracles with the human voice, and although
she is nearly 90, we can still hear something like the same sound, - though
like Joyce Grenfell, she too has grown English.
Both Radio 3 plays this week were revived in memory of dead participants - a
formula that might too easily sentence us to old-time revivals a dozen times
a week. On Sunday, The Ballad of Peckham Rye, by Muriel Spark, with music by
Tristram Cary, recalled Christopher Holme, the director, who died last year.
Under his direction, it had won the 1962 Italia Prize.
When Spark's Dougal Douglas (Frank Duncan) moves to Peckham Rye, disturbance
breaks out at every level of local society. It's all treated frivolously,
even if concerned with such serious things as blackmail, business, assault
or romance, and it is not surprising that Dougal claims to be the Devil.
Some metrical dialogue is sung, but there is nothing like a real song. It
was fun with no cultural objective, and yes, it was nice to hear
once-familiar voices like Denise Bryer and Vivienne Chatterton.
But on Tuesday another memorial play, Visitors, the first play by Terence
Hands, who died last year in an accident, brought very much less fun.
Originally transmitted in 1984,it imagines the delusions of a senile man
confined to a wheelchair (Harry Andrews, admirable as always), veering from
romantic fantasies to a vision of death. It seemed sentimental and
unconvincing.
Listeners who like to be reminded what they enjoyed when they were younger
may have a splendid time with Radio 2 next week (not that Radio 2 doesn't
spend a fair time in that territory). Lunchtime Saturday, The Goon Show;
Sunday (part of The Vintage Years) the Billy Cotton Band Show; Tuesday,
George Formby - George Formby, Junior, that is, not the one they used to see
when they were on leave from the trenches. On Tuesday, though, Radio 4 did a
feature about a possible immortal we hardly know about, the Trabant
motor-car.
In A Legend on Wheels, Oliver Walston told how it was to buy a Trabant in
East Germany and drive it to Cambridge. To be frank, one didn't learn much
about the car, except that it has a two-cylinder two-stroke engine with the
fuel-tank sited above it, a 'notchy' gearbox with four forward speeds and
reverse operated from the steering-column. This was more like a Dylan Winter
adventure than a motoring feature.
The emphasis was on the awkward gear-change, the blue clouds emitted when
the choke was in, the humiliation of being passed on the Autobahn at the
90kmh top speed. You might think that it would have the salutary effect of
dissuading people from wanting to own one of these unfriendly motors. Not at
all. Walston, having driven his home to Cambridge, set out at once to buy
more - a station-wagon, a military version, and a de luxe edition with a
Volkswagen engine.

FT  18 APR 92 / Arts: The timbre of Indian timber
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE NICHOLSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IF YOU think Indian art is about refined miniature painting and the clean
lines of the Taj Mahal, then the exhibition 'Living Wood' at the Whitechapel
Gallery will change your mind.
Celebrating the South Indian woodcarving tradition, this is a pioneering
show of 120 animals, gods, spirits, chariots and architectural elements made
in southern India since the 15th century. From a 2 1/2 m high, gold-painted
strutting peacock used for temple processions to an equally large,
sumptuously carved door of Burma teak which once led into a wealthy trader's
mansion in Chattinad, all but a handful are on public view for the first
time.
India's craftsmen have produced some of the world's most remarkable
woodcarvings. Their skills so astonished the sophisticated Mughals who
invaded North India in the 16th century that they employed native Hindu
woodcarvers to build and decorate their Islamic buildings. This exhibition
concentrates on the pure Hindu traditions of the South, where the Dravadian
culture was never knocked on its side by Islamic invaders.
High-quality wooden sculpture has been a feature of life in southern India
down the centuries, and continues to do so, but until now it has largely
been ignored by academics. The vast wealth of material is mostly unpublished
and thus unknown except to the more intrepid travellers to India. George
Michell, who researched the exhibition and edited its substantial catalogue,
has set out to change this.
His aim of opening up another chapter in Indian art, to publicise the 'pure
enjoyment and aesthetic stimulus' of South Indian woodcarving, has meant
turning detective to ferret out the exhibits. Some, including a great
painted screen flanked by grinning monkeys, have been shipped from Perth,
Western Australia, where there is a foundation for Indian art, established
by an American who made a fortune in Australia and spent much of it on
Indian art.
By contrast, a great goddess sitting astride a winged bull and several other
votive images come from Mysore University's substantial Folklore Museum,
which miraculously struggles along on an annual budget of Pounds 80, with no
hope of exhibitions or publications. Closer to home, Mr Michell spent a day
at the Victoria &amp; Albert Museum unpacking 20 cases which had not been opened
since the Indian Collection was moved there from the Imperial Institute in
the 1950s.
The Whitechapel Gallery held its first exhibition of Indian art in 1904, a
general survey grandly entitled 'Indian Empire'. Mr Michell's show, ranging
from high-class, intellectual temple carving to simple pieces of nature
worship, is unified by each exhibit's freshness, directness and energy. Such
a show demonstrates just how far the appreciation of Indian art in Britain
has progressed.
Sponsored by The Henry Moore Foundation, Visiting Arts, Grindlays Bank, and
Cox&amp; Kings Travel. At Whitechapel Art Gallery, London E1, (071) 377 5015,
until May 31, then at Cliffe Castle, Bradford, June 13-August 9.

FT  18 APR 92 / Arts (Theatre): Wistfully into the past
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE original play, a wry comedy, was by Kaufman and Hart, they of The Man
Who Came to Dinner and You Can't Take It With You. In 1980 Stephen Sondheim
began turning it into a musical for Broadway, where it won some esteem but
flopped (some of the songs have stayed around, but it has never had a London
production); last week he and his writer George Furth were still working on
it in Leicester, obviously to good purpose. This time, it doesn't look
remotely like a flop.
Like most Sondheim shows, Merrily We Roll Along is noticeably clever. In
this case, however, the basic trouvaille came from Kaufman and Hart: trace
the history of a bosom threesome, step by step - but backwards, from soured
middle-age to their starry-eyed beginnings. Apart from the reverse
chronology, the mood of wistful disillusion recalls Sondheim's earlier
Follies, though there the principal characters were all performers. The
threesome here are two writers and a composer.
We first meet Frank, the latter, in 1979 at his Bel Air party to celebrate
his new movie-musical, where Mary - suffering from a hopeless block ever
since her one successful novel - is a drunken and embarrassing guest. Then,
six years earlier, we meet Charley too, on a TV chat show with Frank (at
whose party Charley's brilliant new play was mentioned), complaining so
indiscreetly that Frank's commercial work has put their collaboration on ice
that the ice turns into permafrost on the spot.
As the years roll back we learn that Gussie, on the verge of divorcing Frank
at the party, used to be married to Joe, Frank and Charley's first big
producer, when she was still the toast of Broadway - and when Frank was
still married to Beth, an innocent Texan gal. . . Paul Kerryson keeps the
story moving swiftly through Martin Johns' steely but flexible set; there
are neat choral transitions between the years, and the below-stage band,
conducted by Julian Kelly, is first-rate.
Maria Friedman makes Mary wonderfully sturdy and hearty, just the sort of
girl who would be forever in unrequited love with Frank. Michael Cantwell's
nervy, fragile Frank seems more a pawn of fate than a wilful sell-out -
there is something odd and secretive about his persona that his role doesn't
tap. Evan Pappas, with the advantage of being American, is Charley to the
life, plaintive, bespectacled and funny (though in retrospect his Pulitzer
Prize seems a bit of a surprise), and he makes the most of his rueful
'Franklin Shephard Inc.]' tirade.
Just before the interval, Jacqueline Dankworth's Beth gives the full,
passionate treatment to her big number outside the divorce court, 'Not a Day
Goes By' - though it makes a wrongfooted introduction: throughout the second
act she is sweeter and simpler than that. Gareth Snook is an impeccable Joe,
rich and then cuckolded and then ruined. As preening Gussie, Louise Gold
looks the part and belts out her music in ripe style; she handles her
flamboyant party-talk with a certain disdain, like someone who would prefer
not to know anybody who talked like that.
If Furth's brisk, jokey dialogue doesn't quite conceal the fact that the
characters are out of familiar stock, the teasing interest of the story lies
anyhow in its (mildly) revelatory regress, not in the psychology of artistic
creation and compromise.
Call it sentimental, if you like. What did you expect - a philosophical
treatise? But there is an extra tease in this ingenious musical, which is
the status of Merrily We Roll Along itself: is it a compromised Frank
product, or a sincere Charley one, or the show that Frank and Charley never
managed to write? The show itself makes a good case for any and all of those
readings, which means that it is at least three times as intriguing as most
musicals, and the Leicester team plays it with winning fervour.

NO ABIDING CITY: EVELYN WAUGH 1939-1966 by Martin Stannard JM Dent Pounds
25, 523 pages
GRAHAM Greene, in a much-quoted phrase, said that his friend Evelyn Waugh
was 'the greatest novelist of my generation'. Waugh wrote to Nancy Mitford
in another well-known quotation: 'You have no idea how much nastier I would
be if I was not a Catholic . . . ' There is the challenge to the biographer:
to show how the literary genius co-existed with the cruel, tormented,
snobbish, offensive, reactionary old buffer.
The second volume of Martin Stannard's biography opens in 1939 with the
fashionable author of black comedies joining the Royal Marines as an
over-age trainee officer - or rather, as he saw it, as a Catholic crusader
in the defence of Christendom.
The love affair with the army was short, and painful on both sides. Waugh
came to feel that he was unwanted (which was true) and that the cause had
been dishonoured; his five days in Crete gave him a conclusive sense of
national disgrace. He began to turn his life into a fiction - 'sensitive,
Catholic, bundled out of a Protestant war because he would not compromise
his honour . . . ' writes Stannard. 'Everyone else had to be wrong . . . '
Here was the impetus for the post-war writings, and also for his short,
unhappy life; he retreated into a dream, a fixation with a romantic and
unreal past.
An important part of that fiction was his infatuation with the aristocracy.
He never truly belonged to it, he was reacting against his Golders Green
birth and his middle-class father. As his son Auberon has written: 'Although
the Waughs were an eminently respectable family . . . the gulf between them
and the carefree traditions of the aristocracy was as great as if he had
been a fishmonger's assistant'. That may be a bit strong but the idea can
stand: there must have been hypocrisy as well as eccentricity in Waugh's
life, which would have heightened self-parody and unreality and, in his
literary art, 'the confusion of social grace with moral worth' (in one of
Stannard's sharper phrases).
Stannard lingers over the detail of Waugh's increasingly isolated and
misanthropic years as country gent. His days were taken up with family,
church, library, increasingly distant friends, and drunken jaunts to London.
He was an old man long before his time.
His (second) marriage, one suspects, will remain mysterious: he must have
been an impossible man. His deficiencies as a father have been aired again
in his son's recent autobiography. The father said of his children: 'I can
only see them as defective adults, feckless, destructive, frivolous,
sensual, humourless . . . ' Was that a joke? Presumably not - the sentence
comes from his diaries. Was it self-parody?
The fundamental concern of his life was his Catholicism, and Stannard
rightly emphasises his obsession with the preservation and propagation of
the Faith, He awaited death for years. He was afraid of madness, and in The
Ordeal of Gilbert Pinfold in 1957 he left a remarkable report on his own
breakdown. Stannard gives the episode a central place in his tale. Were
Waugh's 'voices' the result of an overuse of narcotics, as he afterwards
claimed, or, as Stannard suggests, did the drugs release 'a barrage of
self-hatred . . . his private catalogue of self-reproach'? If he was mad,
perhaps he should have bitten a few more of our novelists . . .
Stannard's biography is careful, readable, and appears exhaustive until one
realises its great weakness, which is that it too rarely illuminates the
most important area of Waugh's life - there is almost no sense of Waugh at
work as writer. There is a welter of detail about the minutiae of the years,
his wartime postings, his feuds with Cyril Connolly, and so on and so forth.
But what happened when this dyspeptic and lonely man closed his library
door, settled at his desk, and picked up his fountain pen? We are not told.
It turns out to be a curiously un-literary biography.

THE GRANTA BOOK OF THE AMERICAN SHORT STORY edited by Richard Ford Granta
Books Pounds 16.99, 710 pages
'ALL MODERN American literature' said Ernest Hemingway, 'comes from one book
by Mark Twain called Huckleberry Finn.' Hemingway was referring to Twain's
vernacular style which, if he did not actually invent it, he made triumphant
use of. This, often coupled with the use of the first person, has enabled
post-Twain American writers to tackle in a wholly satisfying way an area of
life which can sometimes prove a minefield.
Simply put, this area of life deals with the superficially humdrum
experiences of ordinary people, and in particular the poignant transition
from innocence to experience. Sherwood Anderson's story 'I'm A Fool' is a
good example, but Ring Lardner, William Carlos Williams, John Steinbeck,
Erskine Caldwell and Hemingway himself have also made this area their own.
Nowhere is their skill more apparent than in the short story. It is
therefore particularly interesting to have a 700-odd page anthology of
American stories selected by one of their younger writers.
Somerset Maugham, who produced an equally large collection in 1947, asserted
that 'in none of the countries of Europe has the short story been so
assiduously cultivated as in the United States.' Richard Ford does not seem
convinced. In his rambling introduction he is strangely offhand about the
distinctive contribution of American writers.
He quotes - with some disbelief - Frank O'Connor's praise in 1962, but he
does not seem to have read Maugham or any of the other commentators who have
hit the same note - HE Bates, for example, who professed an 'abiding respect
for the short story in America'. Apart from this one feels that The Granta
Book of the American Short Story should have been sub-titled . . . since the
Second World War, for that is where it starts. Everyone else begins with
Irving, Hawthorne, Poe, Melville, James, Crane et alia.
Not that this matters very much, provided the guidelines are made clear. But
Richard Ford does not make them clear. In fact he is so downbeat that we
could be dealing with his namesake, Harrison. It is only after reading all
of his selected 43 stories that one realises what he is driving at.
He begins with some old chestnuts of the forties and fifties - for example,
Paul Bowles's account of the professor who had his tongue cut out in North
Africa, Robert Penn Warren's 'Blackberry Winter', Shirley Jackson's 'The
Lottery' and Flannery O'Connor's 'Good Country People'. These stories reveal
the underside of human nature without any attempt at catharsis.
With Donald Barthelme's 'The Indian Uprising' (another favourite anthology
piece) we enter the post-modernist sixties. But there is only a breath of
this before we are ushered into the true holy land, the land of Raymond
Carver, Oregonian manual labourer and master of the minimalist mode.
Carver is king because he successfully follows Ford's own approach to
fiction, that is, that you write because 'lived life somehow isn't enough'.
Carver's contribution is therefore a significant advance over the nastiness
of Bowles and the naturalistic melodrama of Flannery O'Connor. His writing
is not only in the vernacular but flat, low keyed, understated. It is also
strangely moving, reminiscent in fact of that neglected master Ring Lardner,
who was so admired by that other Middle Western writer, Ernest Hemingway.
And it was of course Hemingway who propounded the iceberg theory of
literature - that you show only one-fifth of your material. The other
four-fifths lie below the surface.
The criterion is what Hemingway called 'writing truly', for which purpose he
said the writer had to have a built in 'shit-detector'. Carver undoubtedly
had one of these useful pieces of equipment and so presumably does Ford,
although he modestly leaves himself out. Blake insisted on 'minute
particulars'. TS Eliot said that the art lay in finding the 'objective
correlative'.
Ford calls it finding the 'fact' ('Standards almost always come after the
fact'). That is why the last story - 'The Things They Carried', by Tim
O'Brien, about the Vietnam war - strikes the right note. Richard Ford's
anthology shows how successfully contemporary American writers have returned
to the path that Twain trod, even though that path is by now a six-lane
highway.

A SOLDIER OF THE GREAT WAR by Mark Helprin Hutchinson Pounds 15.99, 792
pages
SOMEONE forgot to tell Mark Helprin that American novelists aren't supposed
to write books like this any more. Big, brainy and bodacious, A Soldier of
the Great War manages to possess both historical sweep and philosophical
depth without resorting to either the mentality of the mini-series or
obscure cant.
It tracks the adventures of Alessandro Giuliani, a young student of
aesthetics from a wealthy Roman family. After a comfortable youth spent
mountain-climbing, studying art and falling in love with the girl in the
villa next door, Alessandro finds himself thrust into the First World War.
He is posted to the Austrian border, where his indoctrination in carnage
comes from the vantage point of a forward observation post. Despite his
ringside seat to daily slaughter, he manages to keep his faith in the
primacy of beauty, even going AWOL during a lull in the fighting to view
Giorgione's La Tempesta in Venice.
Eventually, Alessandro and his unit are sent to Sicily to chase deserters up
Mt Etna. Unwilling to bring back his quarry to face the firing squad,
Alessandro himself deserts and is soon captured and sentenced to die. He is
reprieved at the last moment by the malevolent Orfeo, a powerful bureaucrat
at the Ministry or War, who toys with Alessandro throughout the book to
satisfy an ancient grudge he bears towards the Giuliani family.
Our hero is sent off to cut marble for graves and then is re-assigned to an
alpine unit where he is stuck on a mountaintop, the northernmost man in the
Italian army. Wounded, he falls in love with his nurse, Ariane, only to be
separated from her, perhaps forever, in a bombing raid. He is then captured
by an elite unit of Austrian cavalry (who turn out to be pacifists), and
survives by helping them compose fictional accounts of battle. The war ends
and he returns to Rome, a nearly broken man, sustained only by his love of
beauty, plans of gaining revenge on Orfeo, and a barely-rational belief that
Ariane is still alive.
Despite the epic grandeur of its plot, A Soldier of the Great War is no mere
historical romp. Rather, Helprin has written a considered, digestible, often
moving novel of ideas, a book with a scope and tone more reminiscent of the
19th century than of our times. The controlling idea here is that
Alessandro's refined sensibility - which has him risking execution to look
at a painting, or noting how birds sing during a fierce battle - is the very
thing that allows him to endure witnessing so much carnage, as well as
enabling him to maintain spiritual communion with those who fall victim to
it.
Helprin carries forward this rather tricky notion with deft style and
narrative grit. Countless times in the narrative, our attention is drawn
away gently from a gruesome reality to a thing of beauty, permanence and
regeneration. It is, largely, a convincing argument although Helprin
overplays his hand at times, especially when it comes to the weather - this
might be the most cloudswept novel ever written.
But Alessandro himself, equal parts stoic and romantic, is such a seductive
figure that many readers will be tempted to put aside their scepticism at
Helprin's potentially quaint philosophy. Personally, I preferred watching
our hero as he wiped out enemy commandos or seduced nurses to listening to
his disquisitions on the spiritual aspects of beauty. But then, that is the
advantage of being able to apply so much skill over so many pages - you end
up writing a novel that is sure to have something for everybody.

THE MAN WHO WASN'T MAIGRET: A PORTRAIT OF GEORGES SIMENON by Patrick Marnham
Bloomsbury Pounds 17.99, 346 pages
THE three best-selling writers of fiction of all time are William
Shakespeare, Jules Verne, Georges Simenon, claims Patrick Marnham. Of these
Simenon has had much the least critical attention but wrote by far the most
books: he published 193 novels under his own name and as many
pseudonymously. His character Maigret, a rival to Sherlock Holmes as the
world's most famous detective, stars in 76 of them; when the commissaire
retired, his exploits had been translated into 55 languages. Each 'Maigret'
took a fortnight to write, during which Simenon was sustained by two bottles
of Bordeaux - 'neither too young nor too old' - a day.
Simenon's mother wanted him to be a baker ('Have you ever heard of a poor
patissier?') but in 1919, aged 15, he walked into the offices of the Gazette
de Liege, demanded a job, became junior newshound and then a scurrilous
columnist. Every word he wrote comes out of those years as court reporter,
when he drank into the small hours with policemen or criminals, watching the
upright burghers of Liege turn into 'cheats' and thieves in the aftermath of
war.
Decades, record sales and millions of dollars later, he remained a
chronicler of les petites gens. Simenon was not Maigret, but, as this
triumphant biography shows, no one else could have created Maigret's
distinctive underworld or his understanding of the criminal mind (both
policeman and criminal, he used to say, once stole sweets from the same
sweet shop). No other serious writer stayed so in touch with his background
that he kept to a vocabulary of 2,000 words so that everyone could enjoy his
work, yet was lauded by writers from TS Eliot to Andre Gide, who called him
the greatest novelist of the century.
Marnham's skill is to pull together the personal and the cultural context of
the Maigret milieu, and thus the different sides of Simenon the man. His
hero is at once the drinking, womanising journalist who turned the fait
divers, the brief news item, into a chain of thrillers, and the fevered
genius whose small-time tales are modern equivalents of Balzac's and
Flaubert's novels of bourgeois 19th century life.
His life story is stupendous. Born in Liege to a father he adored and a
mother he loathed, he changed from school swot into delinquent during the
First World War, when he saw the corruption of occupation. He formed an arty
clique called la caque (the herring barrel, a reference to its tightly
packed meetings), whose members admired Expressionism, hung out with
prostitutes and drug-dealers, and were obsessed with the symbol of the
hanged man. One of them hanged himself from a church door  - the story of Le
Pendu de St Pholien; others were later convicted for murder.
Simenon broke away to Paris, stalked the cheap hotels and hookers by the
Gare du Nord, but impressed Colette with a short story. Editors flocked;
Simenon's output grew; in 1928 alone he published 44 pulp novels. He was
rich, gave wild parties, married but continued to prefer prostitutes, had an
affair with Josephine Baker and one with his wife's maid, Boule, which
outlasted the marriage. When Monsieur and Madame Simenon travelled around
France and the Netherlands by boat, Boule came too; they slept in a cabin
and she, in a tent on the beach, was summoned by trumpet each morning.
On one such trip, in 1929, Simenon decamped to a cafe and in a haze of
schnapps 'began to see the powerful and imposing bulk of a gentleman
emerging, who . . . would make an acceptable detective-inspector'. The
large, grumpy, imperturbable, watchful commissaire recalled Simenon's
father, who used secretly to support him against his mother. But Maigret's
insight into criminal motivation, his refusal to pass moral judgments, were
Simenon's own: 'I was born in the dark and the rain, and I got away. The
crimes I write about are the crimes I would have committed if I had not got
away'.
Simenon is compelling because he shows how close the deranged mind is to the
ordinary mind; he puts characters in positions which push them to the limits
of experience and shows what happens to them at the ends of their tether. He
wrote, he said, to rid himself of the ghosts of his imagination, but the
personal cost was enormous.
His blackest books were driven by hatred of his second wife, Denise, when
she announced he no longer attracted her. 'Fais vite,' she would say when he
insisted; she accompanied him to brothels, tormented and fought him, and
spent years in an asylum while Simenon contented himself with maids ('On
passe toutes a la casserole?' - do we all get laid? - asked a new one). His
daughter, Marie-Jo, had a breakdown which Simenon could not resist turning
into fiction in La Disparition d'Odile; its heroine attempts suicide. A few
years later Marie-Jo made a final phone call to her father and shot herself
through the heart.
Asked what made a novelist, Simenon replied 'a man who does not like his
mother, or who never received mother-love'. His novel Le Chat is a pitiless
account of his mother and her second husband; they married for money but
were convinced each would poison the other, and kept food in separate locked
larders in the kitchen. Was he subconsciously trying to please her? Before
she died, he produced four to five books a year; shortly afterwards, he
abandoned fiction writing completely.
In its attempt to pinpoint the key moments and motives of fictional
creation, this is a model of literary biography. Like Simenon, Marnham is
non-judgmental, entertaining, compact; a quick detail encapsulates a trip
across France here, a novel's topography there. From pungent French
countryside to gloomy Channel port, Maigret inhabits a precisely delineated
imaginative landscape; Marnham explains with glee and sensitivity its
origins.

THE 100 MILE CITY by Deyan Sudjic Andre Deutsch Pounds 20, 313 pages
CITIES began as market-places fortified against attack. In this double
genesis lies their essence. By bringing together seekers and suppliers they
provide an arena for every imaginable kind of transaction, and thereby
generate wealth and its concomitant, power. By focusing that power they
dominate their hinterlands, once consisting of the passes, fords and arable
lands viewable from their watchtowers, but now consisting of economic and
political landscapes spreading right across the world.
Cities are also the forcing-houses of culture. Rural life enthrals people in
long rhythms not of time but of recurrence, whereas city life restlessly
pushes people into the future, demanding of them quick thinking and quicker
reflexes. Urban existence constitutes a different dimension of human
experience, and almost every type of material and intellectual progress is
owed to it, as is almost every type of spiritual regress.
Until the late eighteenth century the character of the city was a given.
Cities were constrained in size by pedestrian endurance, sewerage
arrangements, food supplies from the neighbouring regions, the reliance of
trade on winds and tides.
The city that Aristotle premissed as the setting for ethical life, and the
city that Renaissance princes sought to beautify as an expression of their
personal grandeur, are in every essential the same. But with the
agricultural and industrial revolutions came dramatic change. To point the
contrast one need only compare, say, San Gimignano and London.
Deyan Sudjic suggests that in the last few years another great
transformation has occurred in the nature of the city. It no longer has an
identifiable core of civic spaces and monumental buildings; it is a 100-mile
diameter catchment area, whose city gates are airports and whose 'centres'
are shopping malls. The paradigm is Los Angeles, sprawling vastly under a
haze of pollution thrown up by the phenomenon that made it possible: the
motor-car.
Sudjic's book is a collection of admirably perceptive essays on the nature
and implications of these recent changes. In swift, polished, highly
readable prose he scrutinises the roles of developers and architects, the
experience of work in the city, and the evolving character of tourism,
transport, housing, conservation, shopping, and much besides.
He is especially good on the themes he identifies as pivotal, some of them
unexpected: the economic and cultural significance of the airport, the role
of the museum, the effect of 'corporate egos' on city skylines.

FT  18 APR 92 / Property: Framed in oak for custom-built living - Clive
Fewins talks to a builder who believes that new barns are better than than
old conversions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE FEWINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IF YOU ask Roderick James, of Carpenter Oak and Woodland, at Colerne in
Wiltshire, why he likes building new oak-framed barns for his clients to
live in, he will say it is because there is more chance of making the oak
timbers visible inside.
'New barns have more potential. The countryside is full of barns badly
converted into homes. We are really specialists in the use of oak for all
purposes,' says Mr James. His latest project, besides a mass of restoration
work, is to quote for roof trusses, rafters and oak win dow frames for the
new Pounds 2m Coin Street Site D housing development near the National
Theatre on the South Bank.
His company will build you a barn of any shape or size, provided it has a
green oak frame.
If you happen to have bought a plot with an existing dwelling on it - a
small bungalow, say, in a ruinous state - the new barn can be erected over
it while you live in the bungalow almost until it is demolished.
Roderick James has done this on several sites - and there has been no
difficulty in obtaining permission to build an oak framed barn and demolish
the bungalow. In most cases the barn has been more suitable for the site and
to the architectural vernacular of the area.
Of course this cannot happen every time. But James uses his
'bungalow-eating' concept to demonstrate the advantages of houses supported
by giant frames of green, or unseasoned, oak - in particular the speed with
which a frame can be erected.
'Oak has great warmth and strength,' he says, 'Its smell and colour appeal
to the senses, and it weathers beautifully. People looking for old buildings
have often decide that a new barn frame suits them best.'
Adaptability is partly the reason for this. You can add to what you have
got, and if the frame shifts, or needs more support, you can modify or
strengthen it fairly easily. You can also extend a house built in this way:
a high proportion of this company's work is providing oak frames for
extensions to existing buildings.
Of course, our forefathers knew all about the framing method. There are few
areas of Britain where, for several hundred years until the late 18th
century, oak, elm, and other hardwood framing ('half timbering,' to some)
was not used in building. Those old crooked buildings from the past add
character to many old towns and villages.
Although Roderick James and Charles Brentnall, his co-director, are keen to
dispel any myth that they have a slavish regard for the past (they are keen
to incorporate modern hi-tech features into the interiors of their
buildings), the methods used are essentially traditional. Each frame,
designed for the individual client, is cut from oak which is still 'green' -
that is, used within two to three years of being felled.
Although there is no shortage of oak for building, they have a renewal
policy. Through the company, you can buy a 'parcel' of felled green oak for
seasoning, as an investment. Carpenter Oak and Woodland also plants two new
oaks for every 15 cubic feet of oak used: for an average sized barn it will
plant between 20 and 30 new trees.
All the buildings are prefabricated, like their 16th, 17th, and 18th century
predecessors (usually in the village sawpit), and transported to the site,
to be erected in between four and six days on a base already prepared by a
sub-contractor.
The company also custom-makes smaller buildings such as garden structures
and adaptations of barns - like the oak-framed studio being built for Andrew
Parrott, the conductor, in the grounds of his Oxfordshire home: a free
standing structure some 10 yards from Mr Parrott's 17 century farmhouse,
connected to it by a glazed, oak-framed walkway.
All the outside framing is of oak, which will be visible from the inside on
completion. The roof contains exactly the same sort of jointing and
windbracing that you will see in a 17th century barn.
Not far away, in the village of Little Wittenham, on the Thames near
Dorchester, Charles Brentnall and his team will shortly erect the oak roof
of an accommodation block and study centre for a group of ecology and
conservation volunteers, and a separate building with a double oak jetty.
Another interesting scheme is on the site of the former Victorian village
school at Appleshaw, near Andover, where Patrick Bogert is acting as project
manager for a new Carpenter Oak frame which will act as an extension to the
old brick and flint building which will be the family home.
Oak is also also suitable for modern schemes such as the Coin Street
development. Architect Alex Lifschutz plans that all 11 houses and 16 flats
will have oak rafters and roof trusses as visible features.
The cost of the oak frame is not a high proportion of the total cost of a
Carpenter Oak house. Building costs usually average about Pounds 50 per sq
ft, James says, but architects' fees are likely to be high.

Gerald Cadogan finds many a 'des. res.' in the green fields of Sussex

SUSSEX is a surprise. It is easy to imagine it as suburban sprawl grown up
round the railway, but as I took the train to the county where I grew up
(and have hardly visited since) the large tracts of well farmed country
astonished me.
So much green space - and so many old houses, medieval period to 17th
century, still in use. Queen Anne and Georgian houses are few, except in
Lewes, the old county town, and Chichester, the cathedral town. The 'beamy
farmhouses,' described by Mary Still, of Stacks relocation agents
(0428-751509), are everywhere: rich in character; a hazard to the tall. Mind
your head when you live in the county of Goodwood and Glyndebourne.
The South Downs, a low range of chalk hills, seem majestic. They rule Sussex
and bar it from the sea. And - just as when I was a boy - it takes ages to
get from Sussex to London by road (hard to believe if your normal route into
town speeds along the M4 from the west, or the M11 from East Anglia).
Before the railways shaped modern Sussex, it was nothing but sticky clay,
small ironworking settlements, and forests, which the iron men chopped to
fuel their forges. Journeying to the coast from London was an ordeal,
however much the wicked delights of Brighton and other Regency watering
holes beckoned the 'beaux.' The railways' success has meant that trunk roads
have lagged. Only now is the bypass round Brighton for the A27 coast road
near completion, and east of Lewes it still awaits massive improvement.
Sussex houses were cottages (large ones for the ironmasters) built of wood,
filled in with wattle and daub (as in Normandy, which is Sussex's
cross-Channel counterpart in everything except cider, calvados and cream -
in England these belong to the west country).
More prosperous cottage-dwellers would put a brick or flint facade on the
timber frame and hang tiles on the upper walls like a shingle cladding, to
protect the wattle and daub against the weather. This is the typical Sussex
house. If you see brick or flint, look for timber underneath.
Although the railways brought newcomers, affluence and gentrification into
the county, people still built in the same old Sussex style, endorsed in the
20th century houses of Lutyens and Norman Shaw. Besides the mediaeval
survivors, many well-built 'Sussex' houses date between 1880 and 1920, in
any size, attractive places to live. They are always coming on the market,
and they are always near a station.
Bridgers, in West Chiltington near Pulborough, is a pretty 1920s cottage on
offer at about Pounds 295,000 from John D Wood (071-493-4106) and Fowlers in
Pulborough. When you return, jaded, from the city, Sussex greenery can still
put you right, thanks to a hundred years of affluence which has encouraged
firm views on planning and conservation. Strategic gaps separate the towns
and villages. Any moves to fill the gaps face fierce opposition.
Long-term high prices for houses and land are the result, though they are
now about 35 per cent down on 1989. 'If you have cash, this is the time to
buy - you can be sure to negotiate a good price' is the agents' message.
Interest picked up in the autumn of 1991, but then declined sharply before
the election. The few successful sales were grouped in the Pounds
100,000-Pounds 200,000 range, where purchasers were not overworried about
the outcome of the election and possible higher taxes. Now the market should
rebound across the board.
At the top, Humberts (0273-478828) is offering a superb Elizabethan E-shaped
large house and 15 acres for about Pounds 1m. Streat Place overlooks a tiny
village set back from the Downs between Hassocks and Lewes. It is that
rarity in Sussex: a building of substance, grand enough to have stone
corners, not at all in the timber cottage-style, although the hung tiles and
the flint in the walls say loudly and clearly that it is in Sussex. More
typical of the county is the timber and brick Mercers Cottage at Twineham
(near Brighton and Haywards Heath). Well placed for the horse trials at
Hickstead, it is actually two separate buildings which make an attractive
ensemble: a two-bedroom cottage - ideal as a place for grandparents,
teenagers or an American-style guesthouse - and a three-bedroom converted
barn moved from elsewhere. The guide price is Pounds 365,000.
At the west end of the county, polo players at Cowdray will want to inspect
the Old Rectory at Bepton near Midhurst, complete with stables and 19 acres.
Strutt &amp; Parker (0273-475411) is bringing it on to the market at over Pounds
600,000. The same agents have Antioch House, an outstanding 17th-18th
century town house on the corner of the High Street and Rotten Row in Lewes.
Offered at over Pounds 400,000, this is a smart merchant's house in one of
England's finest towns; a place for curling up to read Jane Austen, thankful
that the third of an acre of walled garden is not too demanding.
Dale Hamme at Piltdown, built in 1452, offers one of Sussex's real medieval
experiences. Its ancient beams and inglenook fireplaces are genuine (unlike
the bogus Piltdown Man 'found' in a nearby gravel pit), and there are
paddocks and stabling for childrens' ponies. GA Town &amp; Country (0825-761844)
offers it at about Pounds 450,000.
An alternative with less ground, at about Pounds 225,000, is Batsford
Farmhouse at Iwood Place, near Heathfield in East Sussex. This is a late
15th century E-shaped hall house (like Streat Place, but of earlier date)
built by ironmasters. Unfortunately a fire in the 16th century lost the
house its wings, leaving an unusual long house. John D Wood is the agent.
Further east, GA Town &amp; Country is the agent for Great Beech near Battle (of
1066 and all that), a Kentish style farmhouse with a converted oast house
and barn with planning permission. There are 28 acres, and the guide price
is Pounds 525,000 - or the property may be split into three lots.
If you enjoy gardening, you may be interested in Stone Court at Staplefield,
in the heart of the rhododendron belt. Nymans, Leonardslee and Wakehurst
Place gardens are all nearby, and so is Gatwick. The old part of the house
is 17th century. John D Wood and Barton &amp; Wyatt (081-977-3374) offers this
sumptuous house with swimming pool, tennis courts, many bedrooms and 22
acres, for about Pounds 850,000.

<TEXT>
'IF YOU POSSIBLY can, avoid cottage cheese pancakes in Slovakia, especially
cottage cheese and strawberry ones from the Hotel Start in Kezmarok', writes
Giles Whittell in Lambada Country: A Ride Across Eastern Europe (Chapmans,
Pounds 14.99). 'Just thinking about them makes me want to be sick again.
They had tinned strawberries inside and chocolate sauce on top. Never a
promising combination. And for cottage cheese, read bacteria bonanza.'
A paragraph like that - constructed with the precision of a very expensive
cocktail - tells you all to need to know about Giles Whittell and his
six-month bike ride, in the spring of 1990, from the Baltic to the Black Sea
(Hannover to Istanbul, actually, by way of Prague, Gdansk, Warsaw, Cracow,
Budapest, Timisoara, Bucharest, Sofia and Burgas).
It tells you that you are in the hands of a really good reporter-writer,
someone who knows instinctively about pace and detail and has the wit to
shove the stiletto home with bacteria bonanza.
As his publisher says, 1990 was too soon to be writing history but a great
time to be making notes and writing them up - the boys from Stasi,
international pollsters (would you credit it), black marketeers, spies
turned locksmiths, vodka bums, rockers, spivs, alpinists, Mormons, Margareta
(who is crazy about the mamba), lovers, all of them observed from the inside
as the rotten empire writhes in final chaos and disillusion.
'Like thousands of others', says Whittell, 'I wanted to see eastern Europe
before it disappeared and became a mere annex of western Europe . . . Once
there, the idea was to ask whether the revolutions had made a difference -
to the beer, the newspapers, the prospect of going to work on a Monday
morning, the way policemen spoke to you, the availability of bicycle spares
. . . And, if I'm honest, I had nothing better to be doing.'
Lambada Country deserves to sell tens of thousands of copies.
Not that the publishing biz is short of energetic young men travelling, by
one means or other, from the Baltic to the Black Sea as history coughs and
splutters. In Stalin's Nose: Across the Face of Europe (HarperCollins,
Pounds 14.99), Rory MacLean rattles from Potsdam to Bucharest by Trabant in
the company of Aunt Zita and Winston the pig who fell on Uncle Peter's head
and consequently killed him, which is how things got started in the first
place.
Unfortunately, MacLean is one of those travel writers who relies far too
heavily on dialogue. There is so much reported speech in Stalin's Nose that
you wonder how on earth he recorded or remembered it all.
You can skim through a country in a rented car, hardly touching its
surfaces, eating packaged biscuits, drinking bottled water; or you can
travel close to the ground, getting under its skin, eating crocodile and
monkey, finishing up in prison (if only for eight hours).
This is what Lieve Joris, a Flemish journalist, does in Back to the Congo
(translated by Stacey Knecht, Macmillan, Pounds 14.99), in which she
retraces the steps of her uncle, a Catholic missionary, in Zaire, formerly
the Belgian Congo.
A book that will appeal to African safari lovers is Aaron Latham's The
Frozen Leopard (HarperCollins, Pounds 14.99), part of the Destination
series, for which Jan Morris makes some risible claims on the dustjacket.
She really ought to control herself. Latham is ok - the book is about Kenya
and Rwanda - but it is oh-so-foolish to speak of him in the same breath as
Hemingway, Dinesen and Conrad, as naughty HarperCollins does.
In the Middle Ages, an estimated 500,000 pilgrims arrived annually at the
shrine of St James the Great in Santiago de Compostela. These days, the
number is down to about 5,000. Modern pilgrims travel on foot, by bike, by
horse, van, bus or car. Many drive as far as Roncesvalles in the Pyrenees
and walk the remaining 700 kms, taking about a month.
What is it all about? What do they think they are doing? You will find most
of the answers, plus some nice pictures by John Miller, in James Bentley's
earnestly researched The Way of Saint James (Pavillion Books, Pounds 14.99)
 -a journey through faith and history, as his publisher aptly calls it.
Escape to the Dales by Bob Allen (Michael Joseph, Pounds 13.99) is charming,
with some very fine photographs: 45 walks in and around the Yorkshire Dales.
Why labour through Ribblesdale and Dentdale, Wensleydale and Swaledale,
Wharfedale and Nidderdale, when you can sit in Notting Hill and have it done
for you?

FT  18 APR 92 / Travel: Visions of real life in robust Rimini - Nigel
Andrews takes a rest cure in his favourite Adriatic resort
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIGEL ANDREWS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'When the myriad lights are turned on at night', says the guidebook, 'you
are no longer on good solid Romagna earth, but in wonderland, and the
dazzled eyes of hundreds of thousands of contemporary inhabitants conjure up
prohibited visions of Las Vegas or Miami Beach.'
AH, THOSE prohibited visions. As a longtime withdrawal-symptoms sufferer
after being prohibited from envisioning Las Vegas and Miami Beach, I am now
a fully-accredited lover of Rimini, and have been for many years.
Birthplace of Federico Fellini, watering place for Emilia Romagna, it has a
robust cheerfulness unrivalled (in my experience) in northern Italy. I go
there every year for a rest cure after two weeks at the Venice film
festival.
First essential: you must not think that the popular Adriatic resort is all
fish and chips and Watneys pubs. True, it is fronted by four miles of noisy,
polyglot sand. That is almost all that the TV travel programmes ever show
you: the Lungomare Marconi (beach), the Viale Vespucci (parallel shopping
street) and the interchangeable glass-box hotels between the two.
Here, families on packages disport in and out of a sea that is surprisingly
alluring in algae-free years. For children, the beach areas are equipped
with mini-playgrounds; for grown-ups, with bars and little cafes; for
passers-by, with some seriously wacky and enjoyable design features. I would
especially like a few art critics to check out the Oasis Beach with its
Rousseau-like jungle-painted arch and camel motif.
I like this aspect of Rimini, but it would be without spiritual lungs if
deprived of the beauties downtown, so take an extended stroll between
bathing sessions. Sample the Malatesta Temple, with its 15th century
Florentine facade by Alberti grafted on to an earlier Franciscan basilica.
The interior boasts exquisite liquefactious bas-reliefs by Agostino Di
Duccio, indicating that the art nouveau spirit was alive and well in Italy
in the 1450s, and a Piero Della Francesca fresco.
Then look at the Piazza Tre Martiri, former Roman forum with gracious 15th
century clocktower; the 27 BC Arch of Augustus, claiming to be the oldest of
Roman arches; the craggy Castel Sigismondo, and the elegant Bridge of
Tiberius, which still allows traffic across it even though time has gnawed
at its arches like rats at a wedding cake.
You are now ready for your afternoon sea-bathe. But I am not going with you.
I have never bathed in the sea at Rimini, preferring to spoil myself at the
Grand Hotel with its quiet flower-girt pool. One cannot afford this place,
goodness knows: Pounds 100 a night in the low season, more in the high.
But it is only for a long weekend. And is there a more beautiful
edge-of-town hotel in Italy? The rooms are cool, high-ceilinged and
furnitured in walnut. And the bathrooms are so large that you can imagine
yourself in one of those 'white telephone' movies of yesteryear, when Gina
Lollobrigida or Silvana Mangano would pick the gleaming instrument out of
the bath foam and coo down it to Marcello Mastroianni or Vittorio De Sica.
As for the gardens, you will understand why I need this place after Venice.
Bosky bowers of pine, the occasional willow, a dove aviary and a fountain
with a stone Neptune pointing a trident at the reception desk. The garden is
artfully floodlit at night, inviting the hotel's dinner guests to waft down
the steps into the fragrant Arcady.
You should have a car in Rimini so that you can visit nearby Pesaro
(optional), Urbino (essential) and Italia In Miniatura (take the children).
This last is a knee-high theme park. You wander concrete walkways between
pint-size simulacra of St Peter's, the Colosseum, the Doge's Palace. Every
famous Italian erection is here, with a circular monorail to allow aerial
views. Make sure you also visit the woody enclosure at the park's rear where
large plaster dinosaurs roam.
Pesaro and Urbino offer culture. The first has a fine picture gallery and a
15th century ducal palace. The second is a hilltop town with another ducal
palace that will blow your eyes out. Rising tall into the sky from a
corniche on the edge of town, its sun-bleached pink stone ascends four
floors, flanked by round towers. White loggias frame the windows, which gaze
down on a verdant valley.
You may not want to venture inside the town - enough to goggle at this 15th
century masterpiece built by a Dalmatian architect for the local Montefeltro
family - but if you do you will find Raphael's birthplace and the
well-stocked National Gallery of the Marches.
Back in Rimini, the sun is sinking and the beaches are emptying into the
Viale Vespucci. Let us not be snobbish. This is a thoroughly cheerful street
after dark, give or take a few English soccer hooligans and mad German
families in lederhosen. One may eat at La Taverna Degli Artisti or (better)
Chez Nous or (better still) La Cafe En Rose. Then one may sit at a pavement
cafe sipping one of those small black bullets called espressi.
The world will pass by and you can play the game called 'First person to
spot a Scotsman in a kilt eating a cornetto ice while reading Il Corriere
Della Sera wins a free sambuca.' I have never won such a game yet, but while
there is Rimini there is hope.

<TEXT>
THE HEDGES look bruised, battered and skeletal from their annual encounter
with the trimmer's flail. Rain falls from a slate-grey sky. The wind howls.
'On a clear day', says Peter Heard, cheerfully, 'you can see Ireland and
Snowdonia.' On a clear day you can probably see the end of the lane from
Heard's farmhouse hotel - but it was not a clear day.
Conclusion: the Gwaun Valley in winter is no place for the weak in spirit.
Less hardy souls must try it in spring or summer when it lacks its broody
Welsh darkness and exudes a lighter quality.
The area, on the edge of the Preseli hills, is so little travelled that
grass grows up the middle of the many twisting tracks which criss-cross it.
It is this isolation which has winkled away so many people from town and
city to west Wales. When they arrive they find they have to earn a living.
Many set up hotels, shops, craft galleries, potteries and other small
businesses to serve the few determined tourists who do encroach on their
seclusion.
Heard is one such exile. An Essex man beavering away at the Bank of England,
he did the classic career U-turn to set up every townie's dream - Tregynon,
a stone-built country farmhouse hotel, complete with oak beams and inglenook
fireplace.
Preseli has that sort of effect on you. Once there you are in the grip of a
strange atmosphere, a kind of have-I-been-here-before? enchantment which is
hard to shake.
The area's links with an ancient past would be evident even to a Millwall
soccer fan. You cannot turn a corner in this part of Wales without falling
over a standing stone, a cromlech or the remains of an ancient fort.
Carn Ingli is one of those compelling piles of stone which you have to
climb. At the top, legend has it, you can talk to the angels. Centuries ago,
it is said, St Brynach used to do just that.
The present meets the past in all sorts of curious ways in the Gwaun Valley.
This tree-lined ice-age gorge keeps traditions alive that have vanished
elsewhere. Every January, 13 children dash from cottage to cottage wishing
their neighbours blwyddn newydd dda - a happy new year. They are a fortnight
late because they still keep to the Roman calendar.
My husband, a south Pembrokeshire man, swears that the hunting of the wren
took place there within living memory . . . but I could not find anyone who
could substantiate his claim.
Badgers, buzzards, herons and ravens have found a home in the valley. Red
kites, falcons, polecats and otters are occasionally spotted. So are
candle-makers, wood-turners, weavers and the like . . . but rarely in the
depths of winter. Spring finds all God's creatures stirring from their
winter hibernation.
Above the tall hedges, filled with flower and budded hawthorn, aching for
the coming of spring, you can catch glimpses of the big Welsh world beyond.
Tregynon Country Farmhouse Hotel, Gwaun Valley, near Fishguard,
Pembrokeshire, is a good place to stay and, more importantly in an area not
renowned for its cuisine, to eat. Tel: 0239-820531, fax: 0239-820808. Bed
and breakfast from Pounds 19.90 per person. Three course dinner Pounds
12.25.

FT  18 APR 92 / Gardening: The plot thickens - The new issue of a bible for
vegetables
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ARTHUR HELLYER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE book Vegetable Garden Display has been in print for 50 years, having
been first published in 1941 as a part of the Dig for Victory campaign
during World War Two. It was then written by staff of the Royal
Horticultural Society, all experts in vegetable growing, control of pests
and diseases, management of soil, manures and fertilisers and other matters.
It was an enormous success - as befitted its excellence - and sold more than
150,000 copies in its first year. It has been reprinted many times and been
through a number of revisions, the biggest change coming in 1981 when it was
completely re-written by Joy Larkcom, a leading specialist in all matters
relating to the cultivation of vegetables in the home garden and allotment.
It was, perhaps, a tacit acknowledgment that, authoritative though the RHS
staff were and still are, their general training tended to be towards fairly
large gardens and that Larkcom better represented the needs of the majority
of modern home gardeners.
The result was excellent, and the Vegetable Garden Display strengthened its
position as the favourite book on this subject. It has not at any time been
especially concerned with the cultivation of vegetables for exhibition, and
that characteristic has been strengthened by Larkcom's association, for her
insistence on quality for home consumption is well known.
Now it is time for a jubilee edition. Not only is Larkcom back as its author
but now her name is fully displayed on a handsome four-colour cover. It is
published by the Royal Horticultural Society and is distributed, price
Pounds 10.95, by Batsford. For the first time it is illustrated in colour
throughout and I consider it excellent value for money.
The book has 160 pages, 12 more than last time, and the contents fall into
two nearly equal sections. An initial 58 pages deal with tools, soils and
the improvement or maintenance of fertility by means of cultivation, the use
of composts, manures and fertilisers, methods of arranging crops, planning
for continuity of cropping, sowing techniques, planting in containers,
watering, weed control, protected cropping, storage for winter and dealing
with pests and diseases including a section on organic remedies.
The rest mostly consists of a straightforward description of vegetables in
alphabetical order with exhaustive descriptions of the way in which each is
grown. There is an easy to follow month-by-month reminder of work in the
vegetable garden, a list of books for further reading, plus the names and
addresses of useful organisations and a comprehensive index.
I find the whole book so admirable that I hesitate to pick out any items for
special mention but, because it is still fairly novel, I think many buyers
will read the section on the bed system of cultivation with special
interest.
This takes the place of the conventional vegetable garden and consists of a
fairly wide bed with long rows running across it, often as much as 30 ft
long and spaced a foot or more apart. In these the vegetables are spaced
out. One can walk along these roads to sow, plant, thin, hoe and eventually
harvest the plants.
Using Joy Larkcom's words, in this system the vegetable garden is divided
into a number of narrow beds, generally separated by permanent paths. Most
plants are grown at equidistant spacing across the bed rather than in widely
spaced rows. Since all the work is done from the paths there is little need
to tread on the soil, which damages soil structure.
Only those areas where vegetables will be grown need be dug and the beds
tend to become more rather than less fertile due to concentration of food
and preservation of soil structure. Roots penetrate more deeply, so plants
can withstand drought better.
There are several variations to the raised bed system including beds that
are permanently raised above ground level by as much as 12 in, which results
in better drainage and faster soil warming. The tops of these beds are
sometimes rounded to give an increased surface area. Larkcom describes beds
in the Golden Acre Park at Leeds which are edged with one railway sleeper on
one side and two on the other, so the beds can be converted into frames.

FT  18 APR 92 / Gardening: Under Granada's enduring spell - The earthy
legacy of Islam rivals the voyage of Columbus as a monument in the history
of Spain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBIN LANE FOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN SPAIN, it is a Fifth Centenary year, but there is more to 1492 than
Christopher Columbus. Five hundred years ago, he did indeed set sail from
Spain to America, believing that he was heading to Asia by a back route. He
was not, however, the only important event of the year.
A few months before, Islamic rule had lost its last seat in Europe: the city
of Granada was surrendered to the Christian Catholic monopoly of the new
rising stars, Ferdinand and Isabella. 'We must adopt the Moslems' works of
charity,' advised the first Christian archbishop of Granada, 'and they must
adopt our faith.' No sooner had the last Moslem marginal been recaptured
than the victors rounded on the third party: in 1492, triumphing Christians
savaged the Jews.
It all makes for a fitting Fifth Centenary, the more you look at it. First,
victory - then, intolerance. The economy, meanwhile, was about to be rescued
from the New World by a man who had no idea what he was doing and had
actually lost his way.
There is also a horticultural story to it all. On the hills of that same
Granada stand not one, but two, of the world's great gardens, with a third
nursery garden of flowers and shrubs across the hills between them. Their
history is one of changing masters, from Moslems through Christians to
modern Spaniards.
Their origins go back to the last of the Islamic dynasties in southern
Spain, the Nasirid sultans of the 13th century. Of the two, the Alhambra is
older and more famous, although many of its smaller patio gardens and
intricate formal hedging are much later additions to the original. None the
less, we can still derive an idea of the Moslems' taste from the Alhambra's
famous Court of the Lions and Court of Myrtles.
In the former, excavations have shown that the central paths originally were
raised above four lower flower beds to show off a carpet of blossom which
the sultans viewed from above. Twelve stone lions, as we can still see,
spouted water into an intersecting canal among a pattern of flowery
formality.
In the Court of Myrtles, a broad canal of water ran up to a neat, circular
conclusion, just as we still see it. Probably, it was flanked even then by
the evergreen hedging and curtains of climbing jasmine which we still enjoy.
The fascination of the Alhambra is its particular use of light, inscriptions
and architectural decoration. The gardens are fine, but I never think that
they compete with those in the Generalise garden, which was begun in the
1320s as a small summer residence for the Moslem governors. There are two
derivations of its Arabic name - 'garden of the architect' or 'noblest of
gardens' - and I like to think that it referred to both.
Here, too, the garden has a link with its first historic plan which goes
back way before 1492 to its Islamic phase. In 1958, archaeologists found the
bones of the original Islamic garden beneath the Generalise's present
Courtyard of the Fountains. Its plan was not so different from the one which
we now see but, like so many Islamic gardens, it was divided into four
symbolic sections. This pattern is now known all over the Islamic world,
from Spain to Afghanistan.
In the centre stood a garden pavilion, spanning the point where the water
canals met. A Moorish poet of Granada describes a similar design in the 14th
century, 'secret for private conversation but open to the approach of
inquisitive visitors.' Perhaps it was covered already with jasmine and other
climbing plants.
These early Islamic gardens were planned for sitting and conversing among
the light and shade of evergreen trees, the scents of roses and climbing
plants, and the constant play of water. I find it fascinating that so little
has changed in the aims of Mediterranean gardening across the centuries.
Subsequent masters added Italian and French style, more box hedging and
latterly, in Spanish hands, some bright bedding flowers and truly awful
garden lights (a final patio flourish, much of which could usefully be
reversed in honour of the Fifth Centenary).
Once, Moorish summer-houses stretched right up the Generalise's hill and led
to the romantic House of the Bride. We have lost them all, along with the
pavilion which stood at the meeting point of the garden's four canals. But
other features continue, and you can see behind modernity to a charm which
makes you happy to imagine a life of retirement as the sultan's man on the
hill.
In the Generalise, the great leisure pavilions remain and their Islamic
decoration and inscriptions are unimpaired. They look down the one surviving
canal of water from the likely original design and stand beneath one of the
loveliest features on the site.
A stone staircase runs down from the highest terrace in the garden, but its
handrail is made as a channel for a falling and constantly-moving stream of
water. This device could be true in spirit to the garden's origins, one of
those 'water-courses beneath the shade of trees' which a contemporary poem
on Moslem gardens mentions. It is not inappropriate that so many
fountain-jets have been added to make arches of spray in the various pools
and canals of the courts below. Their Moslem governors would have loved the
effect and sound of this water and its refrain.
They would also have appreciated the planting. We know something about the
flowers of Spanish gardens in the 14th century from Arabic books and poems
and a calendar of the seasons, as described in the nearby city of Cordova.
Spanish gardeners since 1900 have done most of the planting which we now see
in the Generalise, but much of it would not have seemed odd to its old
inhabitants.
Cypress, myrtle, blue iris, jasmine, red roses, thyme and narcissus are but
a few of the flowers known to have been loved in the gardens of this region
under Moslem rule in the 14th century. Since then, some awful zinnias have
intruded, but there have also been gains from discoveries in the Far East
which Moslems never imagined.
This very week, the Generalise is the site of a marvellous curtain of white
Banksian roses and cascades of pale purple, scented wisteria. It would take
only the smallest discipline and artistic exercise to banish some of the
accompanying modern Spanish rubbish and transform the place into a
Sittinghurst of southern Europe. Nightingales still sing in the myrtles of
the garden's upper terraces, while plaster busts of classical figures look
across from the highest terrace to the soft pink stone of the Alhambra's
outer walls.
In this anniversary year, it is the continuity which continues to impress
me. When Arabs first came out of their peninsula into Syria in the 7th
century, they had not a clue about proper gardens - let alone the natural,
springtime olives and blood-red anemones of Syria; the dovecotes and quinces
of Iran; or the wild tulips and irises which stretched through southern Asia
and north Africa.
In the Koran, their prophet had pictured gardens in heaven only, thick with
grapes and fruits: his heirs now found natural gardens all around them in
landscapes which Mohammed had never imagined. They were not slow to take to
the Mediterranean's natural lessons. There are early reports of huge acts of
terracing and transporting as Arab patrons shipped garden plants from one
end of the Mediterranean to the other. They fell naturally into a style of
greenery, intimacy and water: nowhere seemed more perfect for it than the
plains around Granada.
During six centuries since, four other cultures have imposed themselves on
the two Granada gardens, the Islamic rulers' one surviving monument in this
field. In spirit, almost all of them have been striving for a similar
effect, although empires and national labels have changed around them with
the centuries.
The two great gardens of Granada need no single centenary to make the point.
'Granada,' wrote the finest of the Arabic poets in the city's golden age,
'is a bride whose crown is the Alhambra, whose jewels are flowers, whose
throne is the Generalise, whose mirror is the surface of its pools, and
whose earrings are the drops of frost.'
After five centuries and more, that picture is still recognisable.

FT  18 APR 92 / Golf: The making of Fred Moneybags
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN HOPKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NINE YEARS ago, on one of his earliest forays on the US tour, Nick Faldo
found himself paired in the Greater Greensboro Open in North Carolina with a
young man named Fred Couples. Couples was 23 and in his third season as a
pro. Faldo was outdriven and outputted but, since it was one of his first
tournaments of the year, he was not unduly worried.
'What is this Fred Couples like?' Faldo was asked after be had completed his
round. 'He is the strong silent type,' Faldo replied. 'He does not say much
and he hits the ball miles.' As an afterthought, Faldo added: 'Oh yes, and
he looks just like Elliott in the film ET.'
Couples, the new US Masters champion, has not changed much since then. His
backswing remains long although his hair is a little shorter; he looks like
Elliott 10 years on. He is uncomfortable at being the centre of attention
and hates telephones. 'I will not answer the 'phone,' he says. 'There may be
someone on the other end.' And he does not read much. 'I don't know how,' he
says, only half joking.
Couples could probably afford to pay someone to read to him. He has won more
money in a shorter time than anyone else in golf - more than Pounds 560,000
since January 1.
In spite of this, he is one of the least affected of men, quietly-spoken,
undemonstrative, self-effacing. He is the sort of fellow who loses his car
keys, forgets to enter tournaments, turns up on the wrong day, leaves his
passport at home. In 1980 Couples, then an amateur, entered a tournament in
California. When he was told that the tournament was limited to pros, he
turned pro on the spot.
Someone once said that behind every successful man is a woman. Behind Fred
Couples is Debbie, an accomplished polo player who owns and trains ponies,
collects antiques, owns and runs an antique business and, in addition,
provides the impetus to keep her husband on his toes.
'She is Fred's spark plug,' says Couples' former caddie. 'He was sitting
around on a couch watching soaps on TV,' Debbie said once, explaining her
role in her husband's success. 'I told him he had to get motivated. I
decided he was the horse to put our money on.'
You listen to what Debbie says, just as you cannot ignore her. She is a
striking blonde who wears big hats and short skirts and is prone to giving
wolf whistles when Fred birdies a hole. Even in a country where making a lot
of noise is normal and acceptable, her whistles and cheers are exceptional.
The staid world of golf was shaken by the way she celebrated her husband's
first tournament victory. After he had holed the winning putt, she raced on
to the green and jumped up, her arms around his neck, her legs around his
waist. Officials at the Masters were terrified at what she might do if Fred
won last Sunday.
Their tournament is a model of decorum, or so they like to think. The
Masters is where guards stop you running and a television commentator was
banned - not by his network but by club officials after he had referred to a
section of the spectators as a mob. Men in green jackets took Debbie to one
side and warned her against any out-of-the-ordinary behaviour.
Golf's appeal to the marketing fraternity is demonstrated by a deal struck
between Couples and a golf manufacturer named Lynx. Couples, the player of
the moment after outstanding performances in last year's Ryder Cup and
winning the world championship in Jamaica last December, was signed by Lynx
earlier this year. He would receive Pounds 580,000 annually for four years
from the club manufacturer in return for using its clubs. Nice money for
Couples.
Last month, Couples found a rich vein of form, finishing first in two
tournaments and second in two others. In those four televised tournaments he
wore a visor, golf bag, glove and umbrella all bearing the name Lynx, as
well as using Lynx clubs. The amount of exposure on TV he and his Lynx
products received was nearly six minutes. Had Lynx been forced to buy a
similar amount of advertising time, it would have cost an estimated Pounds
272,941.
Couples can do no wrong at present. Another one of his endorsements is with
Ashworth, a clothes manufacturer. In 1987, when Couples was a par five away
from success, Ashworth's sales were barely Pounds 600,000 annually. Now,
with Couples riding high, they total Pounds 10m.
Couples has become the sweetheart of US golf. He has come through the
torment of hitting a nine iron 20 yards wide of the 18th green in the 1989
Ryder Cup and thus losing to Christy O'Connor Jnr. The signs are that he
could become the best American since Tom Watson at his peak 10 years ago. If
he does, Debbie Couples will be behind him, whistling and cheering every
step of the way.

FT  18 APR 92 / Tennis: Biff, bash, match - crisis - Tennis faces a power
struggle. John Barrett considers the possible solutions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BARRETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONE OF the basic rules of marketing is to heed the views of the customer.
Whether you are selling soap in supermarkets or seats in sports stadia, the
customer's satisfaction must be your first concern.
So what do tennis fans think about the problem of service dominance in the
men's game on fast surfaces? Here is one view:
'To see the real art of the game, one must watch it on relatively slow hard
courts where the mere possession of a fast service and expert volleying
technique rarely suffices to overcome a deficiency of ground stroke play.'
Quite so.
What, then, do spectators think should be done to curb the power of the
server without changing the basic characteristics of the game? Here are two
constructive suggestions from readers:
'Experiments have been carried out in France with a shortened service court.
Could not the same effect be obtained by having a server's line drawn behind
the baseline . . . this would have the added advantage of making it more
difficult for the server to get to the net?'
'There are many who think the most effective answer to the present undue
dominance of service power would be a softer ball.'
Sensible proposals, you will probably think. It might surprise you to know
that the above extracts are all from letters addressed to Lawn Tennis and
Badminton magazine in 1958. Yes, even 34 years ago there was an awareness
among keen tennis fans that power was threatening to diminish spectator
enjoyment by reducing the number of rallies.
Yet the 'villains' of 1958 - men like Wimbledon finalists Ashley Cooper and
Neale Fraser of Australia, both strong serve-and-volleyers - were babes by
comparison with the modern power brokers like Goran Ivanisevic, Boris
Becker, Michael Stich and Richard Krajicek.
Why? In a word, technology.
The modern tennis racket has about as much in common with the old
wooden-framed models (which were the game's only implements for more than
100 years) as Concorde does with the Tiger Moth. Instead of introducing a
rule to retain wood as the only allowable material, as cricket and baseball
did when threatened with aluminium bats, the International Tennis Federation
simply sat still and watched while technology ran riot.
With hindsight, they wish now that they had acted back in the 1960s when
first the Spalding Smasher (as used by Pancho Gonzales to beat Charlie
Pasarell in that epic Wimbledon Centre Court duel in 1969), and then the
Wilson T2000 (which Ann Jones used to win her Wimbledon singles title the
same year), started the avalanche.
Technology has come a long way since then. Incorporating space-age materials
and computer-generated aerodynamic design features, today's wide-bodied
weapons - made of graphite and boron, Kevlar, titanium and ceramics -
deliver up to 32 per cent more power than the old wooden frames. Laboratory
tests show that a wooden racket swung at 62 mph by an averagely strong male
would deliver a serve at 86 mph. Because of improved air-flow design, the
same player could swing a modern wide-bodied frame at 78 mph and thump down
his serve at 114 mph.
Of course, today's super athletes are far stronger than average, and getting
taller. In 1973, only four of the top 10 ranked men were over 6ft tall. By
1983, there were six; last year, nine. These giants regularly deliver their
serves at up to 130 mph. At that speed, the reaction time for the receiver -
from the moment the ball is struck to the moment it hits the court - is just
0.3 of a second. On a fast surface like grass or indoor carpet, there is no
time to think. Instant reaction is the only hope.
Furthermore, the 'sweet spot,' or effective hitting area, on today's
oversize rackets is six times larger than on a wooden racket, so that the
game really is easier to play than it used to be. Wonderful news, this, for
the club enthusiast; but is the increased margin of error really necessary
for the professional player who, by definition, should be able to middle the
ball all the time - a point that Jimmy Connors is always making?
All that we have done is to reduce the premium on skill. Average players
have become good; good players have become great; and the truly great
performer with touch and flair, like Ilie Nastase, has been killed off,
unable to live at the pace set by today's young gladiators.
On fast courts, therefore, the men's game has become one-dimensional.
Two-stroke tennis has become a boring reality. In Stuttgart the other week,
young Ivanisevic delivered 105 aces during his winning run, including 32 in
the final against Stefan Edberg. It was not much of a spectacle for the poor
spectator.
And I do not have to remind you that the same unfortunate Edberg was beaten
in last year's Wimbledon semi-final by Michael Stich's overpowering game
without ever losing his own service. That was another of those
one-dimensional matches with few rallies.
It is not only a service problem. Those spectacular forehand and backhand
winners from the likes of Andre Agassi are equally responsible for reducing
the length of rallies. They would have been impossible to play with a wooden
racket.
The male players themselves are conscious of the need to take action before
boredom turns away the fans or, perish the thought, encourages them to watch
women's matches instead. For it is undeniably true that modern racket
technology has improved the women's game by making it possible for them to
serve better and hit early winners, so reducing the number of long, boring
rallies.
What, if anything, can be done?
Some interesting suggestions emerged from the ATP forum I attended recently
in Florida. There are two main options. You can either tinker with the rules
or put limits on equipment - or effect a combination of both.
To inhibit the server, the height of the net could be raised, the service
court shortened, a server's line introduced behind the baseline, the foot
fault rule re-introduced, or the server allowed only one serve. The problem
here is that all changes to court dimensions or rules must be applied
universally to men and women, amateurs and professionals.
Changes to the rules governing equipment could include softer balls, slower
court surfaces (not an option for grass), and less powerful rackets. Already
at certain tournaments, including the US Open, men and women use different
models of the same ball - there is a heavy-duty version for the men. More
experiments will certainly be done on this option because the balls used
today are harder and faster than they used to be.
My own preferred solution would be to tackle racket performance. Although it
is probably impracticable to return to the days of wooden rackets (no major
manufacturer any longer produces them), it would be easy to define a head
size near to the 78 square inches of the traditional wooden frame as well as
insisting on a similar flex.
It is the stiffness in the modern frame that is the basis of its power. A
move in this direction would tackle the problem at its source, whereas
tinkering with the rules deals only with the symptoms.
I see no difficulty in legislating only for men. There are plenty of
precedents in sport where men and women use equipment with different
specifications so as to recognise differences in physique. A woman does not
throw as heavy a discus, javelin or shot as the male athlete, nor are the
hurdles she traverses as high.
However, I can foresee a torrent of protest from players whose advantage
would be reduced and from manufacturers whose whole marketing thrust has
been built around the merits of power. Yet I would remind the players that,
regardless of racket size or material, the bigger, stronger athletes have
always been the best servers. That would still be true with smaller-headed
frames of increased flex.
But, crucially, the premium on skill would also be restored so that a future
Nastase or McEnroe could once again emerge to pit his wits against the men
of power. We might even see rallies again]
That is what the paying public wants to see. The game will ignore that
message at its peril.

WHAT does it cost to have a Lotus Elan windscreen replaced? The answer is
that it depends who does it. If you call in an instant-fit specialist, it is
Pounds 333. If you give the job to a Lotus dealer, it can be nearly twice as
much.
When Elan owner John Field discovered a small stone chip in his screen, he
decided to have it replaced before it became an extensive crack. So he
called National Windscreen. Before quoting a price, National asked for the
Elan's chassis number. It explained that as only official Lotus sealing
strips would be used, the car had to be identified precisely.
Field thought National's Pounds 333 quote reasonable. But he decided that as
the car was due for a service, his Lotus dealer might as well replace the
screen while the car was in the workshop. He was so surprised to get a
Pounds 630.33 bill for fitting the screen that he wrote to me: 'It just
seems that the Lotus figure is excessive. My insurance company will pay, but
is this one reason for the great increase in premiums?'
I put the point to Lotus. Senior executive Colin Gething considered the
dealer's price was right for both parts and labour. Why could National fit
an identical screen at half the price? According to Gething, I was not
comparing like with like. When replacing an Elan's screen, National did not
fit new weather strips to the A-posts (windscreen pillars) as Lotus
recommended.
Could this really account for the charge being virtually twice as high?
Apparently, yes. By Lotus's calculation, not replacing the A-post strips had
saved National about Pounds 50 in parts plus three hours' labour.
Gething explained that Lotus dealers set their own labour charges, which
varied from one to another and took account of the level of service given.
Those who collected and delivered cars for servicing, and provided loan
vehicles, charged more than those who did not.
That is fair enough. But assume a dealer charged Pounds 50 an hour. Three
hours spent fitting Pounds 50 worth of A-post weather strips accounts for
Pounds 200 on top of National's Pounds 333 quote, making Pounds 533.
(Field's windscreen replacement bill, remember, was Pounds 100 more than
that).
David Scott, technical services manager of National Windscreen, shed some
light on the matter. His firm replaces several hundred thousand front and
rear screens and side windows every year.
Like most modern cars, a Lotus Elan's screen is bonded in place. Some trim
items have to be replaced as a matter of course. Others can sometimes be
re-used, depending on the state of the car; National leaves the decision to
the skilled fitter doing the job.
'We work with the insurance companies. We try to save money by only
replacing what we know to be essential,' Scott said. 'All our work is
covered by a 12-month warranty.' Did this include water leakage? I wondered.
'Of course.'
The years of experience accumulated by National Windscreen and other
specialists like Autoglass has been recognised by the insurance companies.
Many now recommend their policyholders to use them instead of franchised car
dealers for glass replacement. People like John Field will understand why.
I would always go to a specialist. The last franchised dealer I asked to
replace a broken screen wanted five days to get the new one - and his quote
was nearly twice as high as that of an instant-fit specialist who installed
one that afternoon in my own drive.
It is not unknown for some franchised garages - I am not referring to
Field's Lotus dealer - to get screen replacement specialists to do the job,
anyway. The trend started long ago with tyres. A garage, asked by a customer
to fit a new set while a car is being serviced, simply sends it round to the
local specialist. It is good business: the work is done at trade price and
the customer is charged retail.
The Consumers' Association's magazine Which? reported recently on the
replacement exhaust business. It gave one of the biggest and most successful
chains a hard time over allegedly recommending unnecessary work. But it
admitted that prices charged at instant-fit outlets were far lower than at
franchised garages.
To be fair, many franchised dealers have launched competitive instant-fit
operations of their own covering tyres, batteries, exhausts and servicing.
The tyre, battery and exhaust specialists have riposted by moving into
servicing and clutch and brake replacement.
Once most straightforward, family-type cars are out of the manufacturer's
warranty, it is no longer essential to have them serviced by a franchised
dealer. Shopping around for routine servicing can save time and money. It is
no different from getting several quotes for painting a house, building an
extension or buying new tyres.
Servicing, particularly of sophisticated cars, can be very expensive. The
high cost is worrying the leasing and contract hire companies; indeed, Stan
Thompson, treasurer of the British Vehicle Rental and Leasing Association,
complains: 'The cost of maintenance is going through the roof.' He suspects
bills are being loaded by small extra jobs, sometimes unnecessary. 'Because
of the difficulty of checking these smaller items, a Pounds 250 job becomes
a Pounds 300 or Pounds 320 job. I feel we are being taken for a ride,'
Thompson adds.
The association's official journal cites a contract hire company's bill for
Pounds 4,000 from a franchised dealer for repairing two executive cars. When
they were inspected by the company's technical director, one car was found
to have needed a Pounds 60 repair and the other a repair costing Pounds 100.
What can the private motorist do? While a car is under warranty, take it to
a known and trusted franchised dealer. When parts have been replaced, ask
for the original ones to be put in a plastic bag in the boot. Some garages,
especially on the Continent, do this automatically.
And when the car is out of warranty, look for best buys in servicing as you
would for anything else.

FT  18 APR 92 / How to Spend It: The green-fingered gurus - How does your
garden grow? / Meeting the professionals who can turn an urban wasteland
into a blooming miracle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCIA VAN DER POST
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN ANY town in Britain a garden is a precious asset. No matter how small, or
how apparently dingy, it is worth taking trouble over. Quite apart from the
pleasure of sitting in it on the few balmy summer days, a garden can also be
a year-long visual delight. Our own patch is small enough but from the
kitchen window I see it day in and day out, and even in winter the trees
beyond it, the birds, the foliage in the containers and the climbers are an
endless source of interest.
However, few of us do as much with our little patches as we could. The
smaller the garden, the more carefully it needs to be thought about, and
although landscape architects have a vested interest in wittering on about
how much houseowners are prepared to spend on their kitchens and how little
on their gardens, they do have a point.
Putting a garden in order can actually cost surprisingly little,
particularly when compared with the vast amounts some of the so-called
luxury kitchens are prone to run into. For instance, a designer like Jane
Eastoe (117 Chetwynd Road, London NW5, tel: 071-482-3322) will do anything
from discussing a new planting scheme to a complete redesign.
She loves gardens to look 'old' and has devised ways and means of making
even the newest garden look as if has been blooming for years. She believes
in putting in a few fairly mature shrubs as focal points, mixing them in
with a few annuals, lots of lilies and then a few perennials as well. She
could supply a new planting scheme for a small London garden for between
Pounds 100 and Pounds 150 - anything requiring building work would obviously
cost a good deal more.
London-based landscape designer Randle Siddeley is very used to creating a
garden from scratch - fast. He will do anything from a windowbox to
corporate schemes and everything in between. He has a great deal of
experience of urban gardening and seems to conjure greenery and verdant
pleasures out of the most unpromising sites - like the narrow strip of space
photographed here, for which he was merely asked 'to do something.' As you
can see it looks quite magical - trellis is a speciality of his and he has
used it here to give definition to the space as well as support for the
climbers. The well-planted containers complete the scheme.
For a smallish urban garden he reckons that a sum of between Pounds 5,000
and Pounds 10,000 really would make a difference to the way you use your
garden and the pleasure you get out of it.
'If necessary I can transform a site in a couple of weeks although, of
course, it is nicer to have more time if possible. I did a small show garden
in a new development and that had to be done in just seven days - it is
amazing what can be done. We put some steps in, a brick border and some
turfing as well as some trellis. That cost Pounds 4,500.'
To show just what can be done we looked at his own average-sized L-shaped
London garden, photographed above. It is a perfect example of the sort of
scheme he can do in a very short time and for about the cost of a very
average kitchen. The whole project cost Pounds 8,500 (including building
works, design fees, plants and labour) and was completed within a month.
He and his wife Kiki Mcdonogh, the fashionable London jeweller, bought the
house just a year ago and 'though it had been owned by a keen gardener it
had become an overgrown jungle. It was a complete mess and had raised
planters all the way round, which sadly I personally hate. I wanted a
cottagey garden, enclosed for privacy and comfort and one that would seem
like an extension to one's living area, another room, if you like, where we
could have dinner on a summer evening.
'I used York stone, which I love, and brick margins to define the geometric
shapes. The diamond pattern of the York stone floor is repeated in the
trellis, which I also love.
'I'm also personally very fond of water, so there is a cascade, a water
feature which pumps itself around and bubbles in from underneath and
cascades over a small weir. I like the sound of water and it's particularly
attractive at night. A water feature, of course, adds to the cost. It must
be properly done with good walls, a tank and proper pipe work, but I think
it is well worth it.
'We used mature plants in order to give us instant pleasure. In each area I
have controlled the colour - I love using just white with dark green
foliage, or at the moment there are the evergreen shrubs, underplanted with
red pansies and tulips, and in another area there is a yellow corner with
yellow tulips coming up.
'It took about a month to put the architectural bones of the garden together
and last July we planted it up - we used lots of relatively established
climbers, mainly about 6 ft high when they went in, a mix of roses, clematis
and jasmine as well as shrubs.
'I think most people don't think enough about lighting. A garden should be
used at all times and if you light it properly it is magical at night, too.
I don't believe in floodlights but like to uplight certain parts of the
garden subtly. An uplighter in front of a tree in the winter accentuates the
branches and in the summer highlights the leaves and makes the garden look
bigger.
'For my own garden I used the experts, The Garden Lighting Company, at
Argent Court, Hook Rise South, Tolworth KT6 7LD. Tel: 081-974-2211.
Siddeley Landscapes is at 3 Palmerston Way, Havelock Terrace, London SW8
4AS. Tel: 071-627-4044. Anybody going to the Chelsea Flower Show should look
out for a Mediterranean Garden that he has created for The Sunday Times.

FT  18 APR 92 / Cookery: The last chicken in the pot
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIPPA DAVENPORT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FIRST time I made stock using chicken wings, a few scraps of flesh fell
from the bones on to the work surface while I was separating the liquid from
the solids. I ate them absent-mindedly, more as a gesture of tidiness than
in the spirit of inquiry.
I did not expect the meat to taste of anything. When a fine batch of chicken
stock has been made, it is reasonable to assume that the bird has given up
all its goodness and flavour to the liquid. The bones and flesh are spent,
ready to throw away. But the meat from those chicken wings tasted of
chicken.
I cannot pretend that this was chicken as you would cook it for eating - the
texture was over-soft from prolonged simmering, the pieces were too small to
be handsome, and the flavour was weak - but it was much better than
expected. A colleague has suggested that cooling the chicken in the stock
pot, as I do, allows some of the flavour to seep back into the flesh.
Encouraged by that first mouthful, I picked a few more slivers of chicken
from the bones and used them at lunchtime, together with a little chopped
parsley, to garnish a tureen of the rich, pure chicken stock. The broth was
received so well that afterwards I freed the rest of the flesh from the
bones, skin and gristle. Now, I aways do.
I use 6-7 lb of chicken wings for every batch of stock I make, and you get 1
1/2 -1 3/4 lb of flesh each time. This is the same amount of meat you will
get from a 4 lb, oven-ready chicken. In these recessionary times, a saving
like this is not to be overlooked.
Chicken broth garnish apart, how best can the salvaged meat be recycled?
Because its flavour and texture are not of prime quality, it is important to
partner the chicken with strong, fresh tastes and to provide a good contrast
of textures. Here are three dishes that work well for me.
CHICKEN CROQUETTES
This is an old-fashioned sort of dish but worth reviving. Deep-fried parsley
and a fresh tomato salsa go well with it.
Make a panada with 2 oz each butter or chicken fat and flour, a scant 1/2 pt
rich chicken stock, and 3 to 4 tablespoons thick cream. Season the very
thick sauce generously with salt, pepper and freshly-grated Parmesan or
chopped capers.
When it is cold and set firm, beat in a good squeeze of lemon juice and some
wholegrain mustard, and stir in  3/4 lb of cooked and finely chopped meat -
all chicken, or a mixture of chicken and ham carved freshly from the bone.
Scoop and roll the mixture into neat little sausage shapes. Dust with flour,
egg-and-crumb and fry until piping hot and crisp.
CHICKEN BONNE FEMME
This is a soothingly pure and simple soup-cum-stew, made along the lines of
waterzoie or water-souchy but without the enrichment of eggs and cream
usually added to Dutch-inspired dish just before serving.
Peel and cut into chunks one good-size potato and carrot per person. Sweat
them for a few minutes in a little chicken fat or butter. Pour on just
enough richly-flavoured chicken stock to cover the vegetables. Add a soupcon
of tarragon and a few spoonfuls of chopped parsley. Cover with a lid and
simmer until the vegetables are half-cooked.
Then add 1 or 2 thickly-sliced leeks and, finally, 3 or 4 oz cooked chicken
meat per person. Simmer for another five minutes or so until the vegetables
are tender and the chicken is thoroughly hot. Check seasoning and serve in
soup plates, on its own, or scattered with diced croutons of fried bread.
CHICKEN PIE WITH ONIONS
I have saved until last my number one choice for using chicken wings twice
over. Serve the pie tepid, about half an hour after it emerges from the
oven. Or, almost better, serve it cold, when it makes marvellous picnic
food.
First, simmer 1 lb roughly-chopped onions in  1/4 pt rich chicken stock
until meltingly tender. Process the contents of the pan with a walnut of
chicken fat or butter to make a soubise-like puree. Measure and top-up with
extra stock as necessary to make 1 pt.
Stir in 5 oz of grated feta cheese and plenty of salt and pepper. Add two
beaten eggs and mix gently with about 1 lb 10 oz of cooked and chopped
chicken meat. If there is not enough chicken, make up the weight with eggs
(hard-boiled and cut into wedges).
Pack the filling into a 10in paella pan, lasagne tin or other shallow metal
dish which has been lined with 3-4 layers of phyllo pastry and brushed
lightly between layers with chicken fat or melted butter. Do not use a
pottery dish as pottery is a poor conductor of heat and soggy pastry may
result.
Cover with 7 or 8 more layers of phyllo, brushed with fat as before, and
tuck in the ends of the pastry to make a neat, well-sealed parcel.
Brush with more fat, score the top decoratively, and bake the pie on a hot
baking sheet at 375'F/190'C (gas mark 5), or just over, for 45 to 50 minutes
until golden.

FT  18 APR 92 / Wine: This bourgeois star - Chateau Lilian-Ladouys
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANCIS ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MY BORDEAUX broker friend had not even heard of Chateau Lilian-Ladouys. 'Oh
no, not another cru bourgeois having money lavished on it,' he said,
referring to Bordeaux's underclass of more than 200 chateaux officially
ranked a notch below the 60-odd chateaux, or crus, classified in 1855. 'All
they do is prove there really is a difference between even the best crus
bourgeois and the crus classes.'
Perhaps he was thinking of Chateau Clarke, a cru bourgeois in Listrac into
which Swiss banker Baron Edmond de Rothschild has immersed his not
inconsiderable personal income from the family's famous crus classe Chateau
Lafite-Rothschild - only to prove, some would say, that in terms of wine
quality, if not geography, the Listrac hinterland is very much more than 15
kilometres away from the peak of Pauillac.
The man who has decided to sink what he made out of electronic payment
systems into an unglorious patch of St Estephe presumably has other crus
bourgeois in mind. Chateaux Monbrison, Sociando-Mallet, Haut-Marbuzet,
Chasse-Spleen and, of course, Gloria can command - purely on the basis of
the quality of wine produced - higher prices than the most lacklustre
(although admittedly underperforming) crus classes.
Until 1990, Christian Thieblot was based in Paris and was chairman of
Sodinforg, a computer company that is now part of Paribas. He and his Swiss
wife, Lilian, had already tried for two years to make a go of a wine
property in the Bas-Medoc, the boondocks of Bordeaux; but they realised
that, to have any chance of making both an impact and fine wine, they would
have to invest in one of the Haut-Medoc's four famous communes: Margaux, St
Julien, Pauillac or St Estephe.
The chance to acquire 10 hectares (25 acres) of vineyard entitled to the
appellation St Estephe seemed too good to pass up and they decided to buy
Chateau Ladouys in May 1989 without even seeing inside the rather handsome
18th century building. Because the property had belonged to the head of St
Estephe's relatively important co-op, where the Ladouys grapes were
vinified, the property was effectively without winemaking equipment. 'There
wasn't even a screwdriver - nothing]' say the Thieblots. But the co-op
connection brought an unexpected bonus. The newcomers let it be known around
the village that they would be happy to buy more vineyard. And since the
Marquis de St Estephe co-op had so many elderly adherents willing to swap
hard weekend work for a tidy little nest egg, the Thieblots were overwhelmed
by vendors.
They now own about 50 hectares (125 acres) of mature vineyard, dotted about
the commune, which makes Chateau Lilian-Ladouys one of St Estephe's biggest
properties. (Christian decided to add his wife's first name to the original
name - perhaps more graceful than Chateau Ladouys-Thieblot, which would have
been the result of the more usual practice.) To the villagers of St Estephe,
Christian Thieblot must seem like a fairy godfather. It must be odd to live
surrounded by new cars, house extensions and small businesses that you have
financed personally.
The unexpected success of the Ladouys' expansion plan meant that the
original architect's drawings have had to be revised dramatically. In the
first summer, they had just two months in which to erect a working winery,
and were rewarded with the miraculously ripe and successful 1989 vintage.
They now have not just one vat room but two, with more stainless steel than
most crus classes and enough tasteful tiling to line every kitchen-diner in
north London.
In the uplit cask hall, the barrels are scrubbed and stained with
perfectionism reminiscent of Mouton. In the bottle store, the visitor is
urged to take note of the quality of the bottles, the thickness of the paper
in which they are wrapped, the quality of the wooden cases and the diversity
of bottle sizes. What started as a mild pipedream has become a major gamble.
Christian Thieblot is staking FFr110m (Pounds 11.38m) and says, calmly, that
he expects to start making money - 'about six per cent ROI' (return on
investment) in 1994.
They have already shown they can make good wine. With Sylvie Franchini as
oenologist, and other local technical expertise, they have produced a 1989
and 1990 that taste as though no expense was spared in the making of them:
enormously ripe, spicy monsters with the tannins needed for a long life
mainly smothered by the fruit.
They are certainly wines to change the minds of those who dismiss St Estephe
as hard and acid in youth, and have already been written up in both American
and French wine magazines. The 1989 was recently voted top of a comparative
tasting of 1989 crus bourgeois by Decanter magazine. But in a market awash
with competently-made claret from the two glorious 1989 and 1990 vintages,
who will soak up the wine from this as yet unknown cru bourgeois?
This consideration may be behind the Thieblots' avowed intent not to plunge
into the general marketplace of Bordeaux merchants but to try to seek out
specific importers instead. 'We want, first of all, to sell to the British
and the Belgians because they are the connoisseurs,' says Thieblot. 'The
French just say we are too expensive.'
Do the French have a point? The Thieblots' pricing policy is, to say the
least, ambitious. They decided that to avoid disenchanting one sector of the
market by raising prices once they had established themselves, they would
put up their price before doing so. Accordingly, the opening price of the
first, 1989 vintage was FFr57 (Pounds 5.90) - the same, presumably
intentionally, as the much more established cru bourgeois Chateau
Sociando-Mallet (which makes it about Pounds 12 a bottle from British
merchants such as Winecellars of London SW18, 081-871-2668; and Summerlee
Wines of Earls Barton, 0604-810488).
Aesthetics, posh tasting room, bilingual polychrome illustrated booklet,
second label (Chateau Naudet), lunches at Taillevent for France's top wine
writers - Christian Thieblot has got the lot. Now all he needs is his ROI.

FT  18 APR 92 / As They Say In Europe: A very British carry-on
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES MORGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ROWS of papers on the news stand at Heathrow terminal 2 last Saturday
gave food for thought. They offered the first reactions to John Major's
election victory. All agreed it was the big story: not just Le Monde and Die
Welt, which take an unusual interest in British affairs - there were also
the Neue Zurcher Zeitung, Die Presse of Vienna, El Pais of Madrid and all
the Italians. On the Malev flight to Budapest, I found a copy of the
Hungarian socialist paper, Nepszabadsag, with the headline 'Carry on Major]'
This doubtless will instil in some British film producer the germ of an idea
for a vulgar new oeuvre in the well-known tradition.
British readers may find this perfectly reasonable, but no continental
election could give rise to the same excitement in the British press. That
is why the supporters of proportional representation are making a great
mistake. British elections are a marvellous sporting event: a two-man fight
and a junior spoiler struggling on unpredictable terrain for victory in a
winner-take-all battle, as the sports writers would say. The allocation of
parliamentary seats (which bears little relationship to votes cast) and the
personal nature of the contest all add to the fun - capped, this time, by
the willingness of ordinary men and women to manipulate opinion pollsters
ruthlessly.
In some ways, the most impressive account was in Die Presse. Its headline
ran: 'Historic victory against all polls.' The chief commentator for this
conservative daily, Thomas Chorherr, rattled off a 600-word celebration for
the front page. 'Europeans were given a multi-stage lesson in a fine English
style yesterday. Politicians, the media, above all the pollsters, will take
it to heart.' He said all the experts were in danger of digging themselves
an ever-deeper grave and added: 'The final spurt in the neck-and-neck race
did not end in a photo finish but a significant victory . . .' He concluded
as he had begun: 'In fine English style in the Mother of Parliaments, pure
parliamentarianism will once again be exercised as it should be.'
Almost everybody delighted in the result, regardless of political
affiliation. El Pais drew a picture of the voters quietly deciding against
'uncertainty' in the 'silence of the polling booths.'
Le Monde's heart, however, went out to Labour. 'It is always difficult to
lose, especially when having made concessions, within honourable limits, to
the ideology of the enemy.' The paper's cartoon showed a battered President
Mitterand saying to an equally damaged Chancellor Kohl: 'I tell you, Helmut,
the English never show solidarity.'
The result in Scotland was also reported universally. The Neue Zurcher
Zeitung said the Tories had been fighting for lost positions but had
justified the 'divide and rule' strategy. 'They played the 'all-or-nothing'
independence policy of the nationalists brilliantly against the middle way
of devolution.'
Nobody was able immediately to supply a coherent explanation for what had
happened. The elation over a surprise result meant that, for one day, there
was a suspension of the disrespectful accounts of the state of Britain which
provide much of the normal fodder for continental readers. This did not mean
the reporters themselves were glad that the Conservatives had won; most had
wanted a Labour victory because it would have provided good copy for weeks
rather than a day.
On Friday, the news agencies and papers regretfully tore up profiles of the
Labour leadership and whole pages were readjusted. Their earlier stories had
all been based on the exit polls which had implied a hung parliament. That
phrase produced some marvellous translations in half a dozen languages which
never have to deal with anything but confused results. A British election
provides a unique European political event: it is all over when the votes
are counted.

FT  18 APR 92 / Novices who pay for a voyage into danger - 120 sailors who
will race around the world
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEITH WHEATLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THIS weekend, an extraordinary fleet of 10 ocean-going yachts will converge
on the Solent and dock at Southampton. The 67ft boats are big, powerful and
conventional. The idea behind them is not. Volunteer crews, who signed up
not knowing a halyard from a half-nelson, have spent two years training to
race these sleek cutters 28,000 miles around the world.
There are 120 of these individuals. Each has raised Pounds 14,750 to pay for
the trip, often through enormous sacrifice.
'It seemed like such a huge sum at the beginning,' reflects Lisa Wood, 33,
formerly deputy superintendant at the Royal Cambridge Home for Soldiers'
Widows. 'Now, I think about what value it's already been to me.'
Wood, admitting cheerfully that she has already sold nearly all her
possessions to pay for her berth, is a fund-raising legend in the project.
She once auctioned the spotlights off her Mini to pay for petrol to get to
the next training course. The car itself has now gone.
From the outset, the British Steel Challenge was designed by its originator,
Chay Blyth, to put the oomph back into yachting - and to do it for anyone
with the courage to carve an adventure out of ordinary life.
Any resemblance to the Whitbread round-the-world race or the America's Cup
is entirely accidental. Blyth has little time for the bronzed gods who flit
from regatta to regatta, milking sponsors of sums adjacent to the national
debt.
'The more elite and exclusive they keep that end of sailing, the more we
benefit,' chuckles Blyth.
In fact, this ex-sergeant from 3 Para, who in 1966 rowed across the
Atlantic, has more than a streak of leveller in him. Blyth is to boating
what John Major is to class warfare.
'I remember the first time I went to a yacht club - barriers all the way,'
he growls in a Scots accent untouched by received pronunciation. 'I hate
every second of yacht snobbery. It's not required.'
Very few among the 120 volunteer crews have any regular sailing background.
'The odd time I've been out on the Solent with friends, I've had the
distinct feeling of walking into a club of which I was not a member,' says
Adrian Rayson, an expatriate agricultural consultant who works mainly in
Nigeria.
The yachts will start from Southampton in September and race the global
course in four legs, stopping at Rio de Janeiro, Hobart and Cape Town before
finishing in the Solent. At least half the course is in the freezing
isolation of the Southern Ocean, where shipboard life is at the very least
uncomfortable and often dangerous.
'People want risk,' says Blyth, cherubic face aglow. 'They buy fast cars, go
skiing - it's all to do with adrenalin. But it's their choice; we're not in
the army now. Anyhow, sailing is a very safe sport. If you want real danger,
look at hunting or rugby.'
To people in the industry, Blyth's plans to raise Pounds 1.8m out of his
crews seemed lunatic. He never doubted, maintaining that there is nothing
clever about enlarging a business sector that already contains flotilla
holidays and chartering.
When his announcement came at the 1989 Boat Show, the 120 berths were sold
out within three weeks. 'I've a waiting list God knows how long,' adds
Blyth. He looked for enthusiasm and commitment among the doctors, shop
assistants, solicitors and crane drivers that he eventually picked. 'Bloody
marvellous people who just wanted to do something a wee bit different for a
year or two,' he says.
One particular story shows the vein of untapped fire Blyth has found. Bill
Vincent is a carpenter at Bath University; a gentle, placid man of 46
married to Pauline, a schoolteacher. They have two teenage sons. On a
winter's night in 1989, he watched Blyth talk about the challenge on
television. Saying only 'I'd love to do that,' Vincent went to bed, trying
to sleep.
Next morning, a day off, he was unable to contain the itch. He instructed
his son: 'Tell your mum I've gone to London to find Chay Blyth,' and set
off. He found sailing's Svengali at the Boat Show, handed over his Pounds 75
deposit and signed up. It was all the cash he had with him.
'On the M4 back to Bath, the reserve fuel light was on the whole way and I
didn't have any money left for petrol,' Vincent laughs. 'I was so worried
about running out, it took my mind off what my wife would think about it
all.' Like so many spouses, Pauline has backed him morally and financially
100 per cent.
Yet, for all the individual struggles to raise Pounds 15,000, the crew
contributions would not even have paid for the 10 identical boats worth
around Pounds 250,000 each. They were designed by David Thomas, father of
the successful Sigma family of racer/cruisers, and built entirely of steel
at the former Devonport dockyard in Plymouth.
Each one is identical in hull shape, weight, sails, layout and handling
arrangements, ensuring that they will compete on exactly level terms without
handicapping. Seeing them alongside in the Prince William marina at Brixham
last week, they looked a fleet for which any medieval prince would have
given his daughters.
Not the least of their appeal was visual. Each of the hulls has a startling
individual paint job reflecting a corporate sponsor. The backers range from
Hofbrau Lager through Nuclear Electric to the Heath insurance group.
Blyth has an exceptional record in finding commercial support for his
projects. At present, for instance, none of the dozen or so British groups
hoping to compete in the Whitbread race starting in 18 months' time has
found corporate support.
'I've never seen myself as a yachtie,' says Blyth. 'What I'm good at it is
raising the money and giving the companies what they want. This is all about
people, publicity and business. There's nothing new in any of it. Queen
Isabella sponsored Columbus.'
Nevertheless, one has a sneaking feeling that Blyth - who says he would have
shot himself if Labour had won the election - is engaged in a
semi-altruistic redistribution of fun. Giving little people with big hearts
a chance to do something extraordinary.
'We've spread the cost as far and as wide as possible,' is the furthest he
will go on this point, fearing for his boardroom cred. One crucial point is
that no individual contribution is for more than about Pounds 250,000.
'These people who go about saying they need Pounds 5m for a yacht race have
obviously never had to go and raise it,' he snorts. 'My motto is to only
offer any company a deal they can accept.'
Some of the sponsoring companies are also sending staff on the race as crew.
Phil Streeter is an engineer who works in British Steel's stainless division
in Sheffield. He'll be racing on the first leg.
'I'd never sailed before in my life but I knew that if I didn't take the
opportunity I'd regret it for the rest of my life,' says Streeter, who had
completed the London marathon the day before our meeting.
'I wouldn't say I'm frightened. The training has convinced me that there is
no serious danger. Let's say I'm looking forward to it with nervous
anticipation.'
Each of the 10 yachts is skippered by a professional, recruited and paid by
the challenge. Adrian Donelly was running American charter yachts in the
West Indies before taking charge of Heath Insured. His background is in the
merchant navy and sailing schools.
'I'm very keen on the seamanship aspect of what we're teaching the crews.
It's missing from such a lot of yachting now,' Donelly says. He also
admitted that he is looking forward to the 'chess game' between rival
skippers as the race progresses. With equal boats and equipment, clever
strategy and crew-work will make the difference.
And after the excitement of two years' preparation, the race, and all the
media attention, comes re-entry to everyday life. The more thoughtful crew
members are already a little concerned. Will Bill Vincent be able to return
to sawing wood in Bath?
'I'm worried about how well I'll be able to fit back in,' he admits. 'I was
so happy before. It was lovely - then this came along.'

FOR THE brands of bicycle we remember from childhood it is all change. UK
cycle makers have been caught recently in a wave of takeovers. Dawes was
bought two years ago by the Dutch group Atag whose main bike brand is
Batavus. The UK industrial group Casket, which already controlled Townsend,
acquired British Eagle and Falcon. The latter includes the Claud Butler and
Holdsworth marques. Derby International which owns the former Raleigh
business - Britain's biggest bike maker - has taken over Kalkhoff of Germany
(renamed Derby Werk) and is building a factory in eastern Germany. Derby
recently failed in an attempt to buy the Peugeot bike business of France.
Peugeot then formed an alliance with the Spanish manufacturer, BH, which
controls Cycles Gitane in France. Muddy Fox, a UK mountain bike maker is in
financial difficulty and is likely to go into new ownership soon.

Germans - A bike maker which avoids the fashion cycle
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE LAST time Tim Pashley pitched up at a sales exhibition to show off the
cycles his family company manufactures, someone chipped in with a question.
'Are these old bikes that you do up?'
W R Pashley makes spanking brand new cycles, but you can see what the
questioner was getting at. From the gates of the company's tiny factory in
Stratford-upon-Avon roll 'butcher's boy' delivery bikes right out of a
Norman Wisdom film: black-painted, sit-up-and-beg two wheelers stern enough
for PC Plod, and ice-cream tricycles last seen on the prom at Blackpool.
Pashley is the biggest supplier of bicycles to the Post Office.
Sportier machines, tandems, and childrens' tricycles carry the Pashley name,
but they are still all hand-made in chunky designs, constructed from steel,
and painted in conservative colours. Some have brakes in the hub and chain
guards. There is not a Day-glow turquoise sunburst paint job, light alloy
frame, or 21-speed rig in sight.
'Our policy is to supply a series of niche markets,' says Pashley, the
company's 36-year-old managing director. 'You won't find us making a BMX,
mountain bike, ordinary children's cycle or sports bike. If a company like
ours does that, you are up against large manufacturers who will kill you
with the economics of scale.'
So it has been since Tim's grandfather, William Rathbone Pashley, began his
carrier cycle company in Birmingham in the 1920s. Pashley has remained a
small supplier. Its yearly output of 10,000 bikes ranks it fifth behind
Derby (formerly Raleigh), Townsend, Dawes and Hawk. It is successful, but
not wildly profitable. From its yearly turnover of Pounds 1.7m, Pashley
screws out a pre-tax profit of about Pounds 40,000. 'Margins are very tight
in bike manufacturing.'
That is one reason why, after 60 years, the company is now trying to learn
some new tricks. It has just introduced a couple of more modern-looking
machines, one of them with 12 speeds. It has appointed its first marketing
manager, who will soon be joined by the company's first salesman. It is
taking an outside cash injection of about Pounds 500,000, looking to raise
sales to Pounds 2.5m this year.
'That won't disturb large bike makers, but it will help us raise profits to
perhaps Pounds 250,000,' Pashley says.
With Pashley two-wheelers costing between Pounds 250 and Pounds 330, geared
to the private rider, the company appeals to people who like classic 'heavy
bike' designs. (Its brochure shows off as many Barbours as bikes.) With
model names like Prospero and Pickle, the image is hardly jazzy.
To fund its stocks, the company uses a bank overdraft facility of Pounds
450,000, but the new equity comes from a venture capital company.
'We will develop our company without recourse to the banks, which have
become increasingly unco-operative,' Pashley argues. 'The City is still a
market which sees its profits in commercial trading, and the commodity
happens to be cash.' You know what Pashley is thinking, but he does not
articulate it: too much wonky bank lending in London to crooks - and as a
result the provinces get it in the neck.
The new cash injection, involving some dilution of the Pashley family
shareholding, also covers another Pashley company, called Spencers, which
makes bike and pram components. Tim Pashley says increasing volume will make
the bike factory more cost-effective. The company has a workforce of 55 and
a Pounds 530,000 yearly wage bill.
To a large extent, Pashley has stood aloof from the UK bike boom (sales up
from 600,000 bikes 20 years ago to 1.25m 10 years ago, and 2.5m in 1989,
though this has back-pedalled to 2m last year). Almost half of the company's
sales are to the Post Office. A third of its turnover comes from exports,
mainly to countries such as Nigeria, where Pashley sturdiness suits road
surfaces even more primitive than those in London. But it also sells
delivery bikes to Germany, France and elsewhere on the continent, where one
of its competitors is the crazily-named Smith &amp; Co of Denmark. At the moment
Pashley is trying to win an order to supply 5,000 two-wheelers to the German
Bundespost.
In keeping with tradition, the Stratford factory is not exactly 21st
century. The company buys in steel tubing already shaped and cut to length
for the frames. Most of the frames are then put together by brazing. The
tube joints, known as lugs, have molten brass poured into them - the brass
acting as glue to hold two pieces of the frame together. This is carried out
by blowtorch at an open hearth.
The frame then disappears into a shotblasting cabinet in which iron filings
are hurled at it, clearing off the joints and giving the frame a smooth grey
finish. The joints are hand-smoothed further in a process known as fettling,
and the frame is then painted, using hand-held electro-static powder coating
equipment. Each bike is finally assembled by two people whose supply bins
are packed with imported components.
'That includes tyres, wheel rims, chains, chain wheels and pedals, which all
have to be imported because they are not available in the UK,' Pashley says.
'That is the sorry tale of the way British industry as a whole has gone.'
Some bike saddles, and 3-speed gears, come from Britain; 12-speeders are
bought from Japan.
The company has usually found diversification painfully unsuccessful. It
once produced motorised rickshaws, and a recent attempt to sell a an
old-style bike with mountain bike-styled tubing failed. Tim Pashley remains
confident, though, that its foray into more modern types of classic bikes
will succeed. 'We are still appealing to the same audience - the
30-somethings, with money.'

Computing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
THE biggest problem of adding to productivity with a PC is being able to get
the information into the computer in the first place.
If your work is to do with words, like mine - whether it is a month-end
report or the first draft of a instruction manual - then you probably
imagine that a word processor would be the best solution. I find it is not.
The trouble with word-processors - as with writing by hand - is that they
tempt me into putting my ideas into sentences from the outset. I inevitably
go back to correct an expression to make it more understandable. The problem
with this approach is that I tend to lose the thread of what I want to write
about. My answer to this dilemma is to use an outliner, or, as it used to be
called, an idea processor.
This allows me to type in ideas as they come to me, without arranging them
into sentences, or putting them into any particular order.
A classic program which allows you to work in this way is PC Outline, though
there are others. An outliner should be able to store notes at different
levels of importance. It should be possible to collapse it to hide all text
below a chosen level, so that the overall structure of the report becomes
clear.
I usually start with the same four headings: Title; Introduction;
Middle-Bit; Conclusion. Then I give the piece a working title. The
introduction to a report often consists of why and for whom I am writing -
so I merely add the words 'who' and 'why.' The middle bit is the hardest. To
start with, I merely write a series of questions which have to be answered.
Such an outline generally takes about 10 minutes - 10 minutes well spent.
The actual writing is a gradual process: adding more questions; finding and
typing the answers. Then there is the ordering of the ideas.
The beauty of this approach, particularly when taking notes from reference
material, is that it enables you to break down the information very quickly,
and when you come to use your references there is no plagiarism involved. If
you have notes from several sources, they often lead you in the same
direction, but usually from different starting-points.
Once you have the information in the outline, you can re-order it to suit
your purpose. For instance, in this article I started with the idea of
increasing productivity. Beginning from a more computer-based
starting-point, the same information can be used for a longer and more
detailed review of the particular software packages.
As well as outliners, there are other forms of software which allow you to
get your basic ideas into the computer quickly, but work on slightly
different principles or with added features.
The most innovative is CK Modeller, often described as a graphical thinking
sketchpad. Instead of using the hierarchical structure of the outliner, it
uses text within hexagons, so that more links can be made between ideas. It
also allows for different colours to be attributed to each hexagon, to
classify the type of information.
You might assign yellow hexagons to represent positive items, black for
problems, and red for short texts on danger. You can assign only a few words
to each hexagon, and these can be rearranged within the honeycomb structure.
Each hexagon can have a note attached to it, and there can be gateways to
other honeycombs, so that the overall subject can be broken down into
building blocks.
Though I can see in this great strengths in solving problems, I do not feel
that CK Modeller can offer advantages over the outliner for putting together
reports and written work. By their nature, these are based on a linear
model.
PC Outline itself is now bundled with Wordstar; PC Tools has its own
outliner within the Desktop suite of programs; Microsoft Word and Word for
Windows have their own. The one with Word Perfect is very basic.
Lotus Agenda is different again. In fact, when it was first marketed, many
people described it as a solution looking for a problem. Agenda gives both a
hierarchical view and a category view. A package called Grandview sits
squarely between PC Outline and Lotus Agenda. Although it has a built-in
word-processor it is more useful for creating, organising, and categorising
textual information.
Though many sneer at using aids to writing (and outliners in particular), I
find it works for me.

funeral directors tell me this is 'possible,' but I so dread the thought of
burial that I should be grateful if you could confirm my will's validity.
What you wish to provide in respect of the disposal of your body (by

your will and appoint an executor who is not likely to renounce probate (ie
will undertake the duty of administering your estate) the provision should
be effective.

FT  18 APR 92 / Finance &amp; The Family (Briefcase): Portable pension
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
I HAVE retired early and live on a pension and investment income. I have
been considering the tax implications of our future plans.
When my son leaves school, which will be in June 1994 or 1995, my wife and I
plan to travel abroad for a lengthy period. We would not necessarily take up
residence in one country but might spend say, a year in the US followed by a
year in Australia.
I would like to establish myself as a non-resident for tax purposes during
this period and need to know how to do this. I shall not, of course be in
full-time employment and I believe this affects the issue. Our house would
either be let or at least available for letting while we are abroad.
What points should I consider in order to establish myself as non-resident
for tax purposes during the period I plan to be overseas? What is the
minimum length of time I need to remain abroad and for how long, and under
what conditions would I be able to return to the UK during this period
without jeopardising my non-resident status? When I first retired (May 1987)
I was told that my pension could be paid to me overseas without deduction of
tax, as most of my employment was with an international bank and had been
carried out overseas. Would this again be possible if I became a
non-resident?
I seek the information so far in advance partly so that I can formulate our
plans in more detail, and partly because it occurs to me that if I switch
the quite considerable amount I now have invested in currency funds into an
offshore roll-up fund, which I either cash or bed-and-breakfast while
enjoying non-resident status, I could considerably reduce my tax bill.
You may not, on the bare facts outlined, actually be able to secure the
agreement of the Inland Revenue that you have both (or either) ceased to be
resident and ordinarily resident in the UK during your extended holiday.
Although it is partly out of date, it is worth asking your tax office for
the free pamphlet 5R20 (Residents and non-residents: liability to tax in the
UK). At the same time, you could ask for the free booklet of extra-statutory
concessions, IR1. In looking at the concessions for non-residents, bear in
mind the warning at the front of the booklet that a concession will not be
given in any case where an attempt is made to avoid tax.

FT  18 APR 92 / Finance &amp; The Family (Briefcase): The problems of dealing
with two tax offices
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
I HAVE TO deal with more than one tax office and this has raised several
questions.
If tax office A asks me, via a standard tax return form, for a full
disclosure of my tax affairs and the corresponding certificates of pension
contributions, including the income and certificates which I know are
required by tax office B, then:
(i) Is it up to me to tell A that they are asking for data required by B,
not A?
(ii) Having made a full and accurate disclosure to A, and received A's
acknowledgement, have I any statutory obligation to supply duplicate details
to B?.
(iii) Do A and B have an obligation to communicate with each other?
I have corresponded at length with Somerset House about this, but the only
effect is that B keeps issuing joke assessments, bearing no relation to the
facts, and I have to plough through their cumbersome appeal procedures.
You recently reported that the Revenue has at last had the unoriginal idea
of one taxpayer - one tax office, but we have to try to cope with the
present attitude that each tax office incommunicado with the others.
A great deal of a taxpayer's time can be wasted by inefficient communication
between tax offices, and even between sections of a single tax office.
(i) It is quite a good idea to make a polite remark in a covering letter,
along the lines of 'No doubt you will be forwarding . . . your colleague at
B District, under reference. . . .
(ii) No (except in rare circumstances).
(iii) Yes, failure to do so constitutes maladministration (except in rare
circumstances).
The circumstances in which a tax inspector 'may make assessment to the best
of his judgment' are prescribed in section 29(l)(b&amp;c) of the Taxes
Management Act 1970.
From what you say, it looks as though the inspector at B District has acted
beyond his statutory authority and is in breach of his statutory duty.
We suggest that you submit a formal complaint to the District Inspector at B
(marking both the envelope and the letter 'For the attention of the District
Inspector') briefly recapitulating the relevant facts and dates, and
claiming (a) reimbursement of your expenses in ploughing through the appeal
procedures necessitated by his having made assessments not authorised by
section 29 of the management Act, and
(b) compensation for the hassle and annoyance caused by the persistent
maladministration within his office.
If, by chance, the Inland Revenue do not give you an adequate response, we
recommend that (after the new Parliament assembles on April 27) you invite
your MP to refer your complaint to the Ombudsman.

FT  18 APR 92 / Finance &amp; the Family: Planning for retirement - Reader Henry
Edmunds explains how he built a portfolio
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HENRY EDMUNDS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ABOUT six years ago, and shortly before I retired, a radical change of
investment policy seemed desirable. The new circumstances required:
Safety of capital.
A regular and fixed income of about 8 per cent gross.
That any growth of capital should be regarded as a bonus.
A simple system which my wife would understand thoroughly. (This condition
arose from seeing the almost total lack of investment experience in several
newly-widowed women I knew; I wanted her to avoid such a handicap).
As it happened, we had two separate portfolios, a mixture of equities,
gilts, building society deposits and a few savings certificates. It was a
bit of a jumble; some sort of order was required. After a good deal of
thought, we came to the conclusion that gilts and high-class industrial
debentures should be the major part of the new system. They would cover the
income side of the policy. Any surplus cash should go into saving
certificates which, if kept for five years, would show a safe but modest
capital appreciation.
We made a start by listing the redemption dates of those gilts we had
already, and the idea evolved that a 10-year cycle would suit our
circumstances. Five years was too short for any worthwhile capital gains but
15 was looking too far ahead. So, we began running down our building society
deposits, sold a few unpromising equities and used the cash to fill in the
blank years.
The programme is now completed; the latest stock to mature (on September 1)
will be E. Surrey Water 7 per cent Deb. 90/92, which was bought in October
1982 at 77 1/2 , and yielding 8.9 per cent. Closely behind will be Bass 3
1/4 per cent Debenture 87/92, bought at 83 on in February 1988 but yielding
only 4 per cent.
With more gilts being issued this summer to cover the huge PSBR,
re-investing this cash, by buying stock to be redeemed in 2002, is likely to
be easier. In 1993, we have two lots of 6 per cent funding coming to
redemption. They were bought at 77 and 74, costing Pounds 11,820 but in a
year's time will be worth Pounds 15,000. Looking at the combined portfolios,
the overall difference between cost price and maturity value works out at
19.3 per cent; it is also accompanied by an 8.2 per cent dividend yield.
Occasionally, we had more than we wanted to invest in the appropriate gilt
or debenture, and this is where savings certificates (ordinary and
index-linked) came in handy. We are now beginning to reinvest those that are
maturing.
The capital profile of the two portfolios now stands as follows: 60 per cent
gilts, debentures and loan stocks; 22 per cent savings certificates; 14 per
cent bank and building society deposits; 4 per cent equities and investment
trusts (Murray zero preference).
I have a jaundiced view of equities. For many years, I have taken between
Pounds 2,000-4,000 annually in capital gains on short-term trading from a
modest capital base. In the present financial year, though, my choice of
Guardian Royal and Premier Oil could hardly have been worse. Welsh Water is,
however, performing fairly well, and so is the Murray zero.
Nevertheless, I am quite pleased with the overall position, but future
buying of fixed-interest stocks will be more difficult and probably less
profitable. Gone are the sunny days of getting a discount of 20-30 per cent
below par and still having an average dividend yield of 8.2 per cent.
Fortunately, buying gilts and savings certificates through National Savings
has been a low-cost operation and so have most investment trusts, via the
occasional lump sum arrangements.

FT  18 APR 92 / Finance &amp; the Family: Picking people to pick your shares / A
look at the choice of advisers and brokers that faces anyone planning to
build a portfolio
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BUYING shares seems to be the thing to do in the fourth Conservative term.
From election night onwards, when brokers allowed trading through the night
 -so that you could sell water shares with every 'Lab Gain' - equities have
enjoyed a bonanza.
Those who want to get involved might ask the following questions.
Where can you go for advice?
Plenty of people offer advice. Ultimately, your best chance of receiving
impartial guidance comes if you pay a fee for it, as your adviser then has
no financial interest in whether you go through with the investment. Pay by
commission, and they will have an incentive to force you into a deal.
If you have a substantial portfolio, you should be able to find a manager
who will look after it, in return for a percentage fee based on the amount
you invest. Broadly speaking, stockbrokers divide into three. Some provide a
'discretionary' service, in which you allow the brokers to decide what to
buy and sell; others give an advisory service, where you will normally pay
them commission for each deal; and the cheapest are 'execution only'
dealers, where brokers give no guidance whatever.
What is the bid-offer spread?
The marketmakers who buy and sell shares do not normally receive either a
fee or a commission for the service. They make their profit from the
'spread' between the price at which they buy, and the price at which they
sell.
When you buy a share, you will pay the 'offer' price. This is higher than
the price at which you could sell them to the marketmaker, which is known as
the 'bid' price. Share prices are usually quoted at the middle-point between
offer and bid, so remember that you will pay more, or receive slightly less,
than this price.
How much will it cost?
Brokers, like marketmakers, cost money. Those who offer broader
discretionary services will charge you more. However they claim that you get
what you pay for.
If you want a truly deluxe service, such as that from James Capel, which
provides copious and highly respected research, and detailed advice on
capital gains tax, then as a discretionary client you will pay an annual fee
of 0.6 per cent of the value of the portfolio up to the first Pounds
500,000. It reduces thereafter. On individual deals you will pay 1.1 per
cent up to the first Pounds 10,000.
Capel's advisory clients pay a Pounds 250 annual fee, plus 1.85 per cent
dealing commission on the first Pounds 10,000 of each deal. It decreases for
higher amounts.
What about discount brokers?
This is the option for those who trust themselves to make the right
decisions. Execution only services will invariably be cheaper, although they
may not necessarily offer better value for money.
The Fidelity Share Service charges a minimum Pounds 25 for deals up to
Pounds 1,400. Up to Pounds 3,900, you pay Pounds 11 plus 1 per cent of the
value of the deal. Above this, up to Pounds 50,000, you pay a flat Pounds
50.
What about the banks?
Privatisations have inspired the banks to offer a competitive service. Some,
like Barclays and Abbey National, are keen on further expansion. Others,
including Midland, Lloyds and TSB, are happy with their current service.
These services tend to be used most for selling privatisation stocks, but
they are definitely cheap. For example, postal sales at Abbey National cost
Pounds 17.50 on deals up to Pounds 2,333, and decline for higher amounts. A
telephone transaction costs a minimum of Pounds 24.50.
Can Personal Equity Plans help?
Yes, particularly for beginners. They allow you to hold up to Pounds 6,000
in a mixture of shares, plus an additional Pounds 3,000 in one single
company.
Tax is the advantage - a Pep is a tax-free pocket, where your shares can
gain in value and pay out dividends without incurring any income or capital
gains tax. However, if shares held in a Pep drop in price, this loss cannot
be offset against gains elsewhere in your portfolio.
Peps' big drawback is the cost of administration. 'Self-select' Peps, where
you deal as you want and have total discretion, are more attractive if you
are prepared to make your own decisions.
How many shares are needed for a portfolio?
Some would claim you might as well ask how long is a piece of string. Unless
you have money you can afford to lose, it must make sense to diversify, and
buy a number of different stocks. There is a slight opportunity cost here -
it will tend to adulterate the gains of a stock market favourite - but you
can now withstand disastrous collapses by one share.
Adequate diversification, at a level which justifies the charges involved in
buying the shares can be achieved with a portfolio of less than Pounds
25,000, according to Brian Tora of stockbrokers Greig Middleton. Assuming
minimum dealing charges of Pounds 25 (good value), the effective minimum
economic holding is Pounds 500. You reduce risk with every additional
company you buy, but this falls off quite quickly. According to Tora, an
adequate spread of risk can be achieved with eight companies. That makes a
minimum feasible portfolio of Pounds 4,000. If you cannot spare this much,
direct investment in equities is not for you.
What about investment trusts?
Investment trusts solve the problem of finding a balanced portfolio, which
is helpful if you are nervous about picking stocks. An investment trust
company is incorporated and quoted just like any other public company, but
its sole business is to invest in other companies. This provides the broad
spread. Theoretically, the trust's fund managers will out-perform the market
for you.
You can buy investment trusts in the same way you buy any other share, using
a broker. Some trusts also have a 'savings scheme' option, so you can
dispense with the broker. What about unit trusts?
Unit trusts, like investment trusts, invest in shares, lowering risk by
diversifying. But they also remove the risk that market sentiment will cause
the price of the shares to fall, even if the underlying portfolio of shares
rises.
Unit trusts are not quoted shares - they are just mutually held funds of
shares. The value of your investment fluctuates automatically in accord with
the value of the shares, but you will normally have to pay a front-end
charge for administration of 5 per cent or more. One group (Murray
Johnstone) has cut this to 1 per cent, but this is against the industry
norm.
What if things go wrong?
There are several avenues for complaint. The Securities and Futures
Authority has a Complaints Bureau. Ultimate compensation should come from
the Investors' Compensation Scheme, which aims to return the first Pounds
30,000 of your investment, plus 90 per cent of the next Pounds 20,000.
Obtaining this is often a tortuous process.
This only guards you against malpractice by the broker. If a share crashes
without trace, then tough. You bear this risk, and no intermediary can be
held accountable for it.

FT  18 APR 92 / Finance &amp; the Family: Beware the election euphoria - Diary
of a Private Investor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN GOLDSTEIN-JACKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AS A private investor, I am pleased with the result of the UK general
election. But the City's immediate euphoria - with the FT-SE 100 leaping
136.2 points on the day after the election - seems a bit too much too soon,
bearing in mind the increasing troubles in eastern Europe; stock market,
banking and property problems in Japan; and continuing unhappy economic
trends in the US, UK and many other countries. I am certainly not rushing to
buy shares at present prices.
At least the UK election campaign did not last long, and we should have
political stability for the next few years, unlike the US where the
presidential campaigns drag on into November with neither of the leading
candidates having much to recommend him. Perhaps there will be a 'late
entrant' to the race who will command more widespread respect and support.
On the home front, what will the benefits be now the Conservatives are back?
Take inheritance tax, for a start.
In the Budget, chancellor Norman Lamont proposed important exemptions from
IHT on certain shareholdings. For example, if someone dies owning more than
25 per cent of an unquoted or USM company, no IHT will be due on that
holding. If he dies owning a controlling interest in a company quoted on the
main market, or a holding of 25 per cent or less in an unquoted or USM
company, there also will be a reduction in the IHT bill.
Legislation for these proposals was delayed because of the election.
Presumably, the government will now seek to enact it as soon as possible.
This means there will eventually be a number of elderly, wealthy people
reducing their small minority investments in a wide range of companies (or
reducing their cash piles) and investing instead in holdings of 25 per cent
or more in certain companies in order to reduce their IHT bills.
If a private investor can spot the likely targets for such investments and
buy shares before those wealthy folk do, then excellent profits could be
made. The reason is that the shares would zoom upwards when any such 25 per
cent-plus deals were announced.
Of course, the shares might then fall back over the years since the wealthy
folk could be less inclined to disinvest (even if faced with declining
dividends and lacklustre performance) because they wish to cling on to the
inheritance tax advantages of their holdings.
Takeover activity should continue under a Conservative government and I
shall try to discover new takeover targets. A government is only as good as
its ministers, though. On that basis, John Major's administration looks
highly promising. Michael Heseltine, as the new minister for trade and
industry, has long been known for his support of small businesses and his
wish to see big changes in parts of Britain's infrastructure.
I am delighted with the arrival of Neil Hamilton and the other new faces at
the Department of Trade and Industry. Hopefully, they can be persuaded to
replace the costly bureaucratic City regulatory bodies with a single,
cheaper, genuinely-independent body with teeth; and engineer legislation and
tax changes to allow and encourage direct investment in shares by private
investors, rather than continuing to favour institutional and
'manager-controlled' investments.

FT  18 APR 92 / Finance &amp; the Family: Buy early and get a better share /
Examining the mystery of a seasonal pattern in dealings around the world
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIGEL MORGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BUY EARLY to get the year's profits. UK share prices seem genuinely to
follow a seasonal pattern which, although not completely regular, has
persisted as an average tendency over the past six, very different years.
One of the best-known sayings from the stock market is 'sell in May and go
away.' Its popularity might partly be due to its encouragement of long
holidays, but it also turns out to be good advice. So would 'put some shares
in your Christmas stocking,' although it does not rhyme. The record of
quarterly percentage movements of share prices in the UK since 1986 is set
out below. On average, the whole of a calendar year's rise is achieved soon
after the end of the first quarter.
Some upward momentum usually is sustained into the second quarter, but it is
then given up over the second half of the year so that the market rises only
1 per cent in the last three quarters of the year.
Average relationships can, of course, be deceptive. They could arise, for
example, from an exceptional result one year swamping a number of opposing,
modest results. But, in this case, the average quarterly results remain
representative year by year.
In only one out of the six did the market fail to rise in the first quarter.
The same is true of the second quarter, although the rises were less
impressive. In each of the third and fourth quarters, the market fell as
often as it rose.
On average, share prices have fallen in the second half of the calendar year
and they have done so as often as they have risen.
All sorts of special factors have influenced the UK: the October 1987 Wall
Street crash, joining the EMS, the fall of Margaret Thatcher, the Gulf war.
Possible explanations for market falls come readily to mind. Who can
remember the good news of early 1989 that brought a rally of the same scale
as the fall suffered 18 months later when Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait?
Before searching too hard for a UK explanation of this seasonal phenomenon,
it is worth looking overseas to see if it is unique to Britain or a more
general feature.
The second table below presents quarterly market performance from elsewhere
in the world. The entries are the average quarterly percentage movements
over the past six years, 1986-91. They are in local currency terms except
for Latin America, which is measured in dollar terms to avoid the confusion
which large devaluations could cause. The results are startling.
As in the UK, the whole of the year's rise in US share prices usually comes
in the first half, and most of it in the first quarter. Perhaps there is
some shared Anglo-Saxon reason for this, but it is hardly obvious given the
huge difference in scale and status of the two economies.
In contrast, Japan's culture - and, particularly, the logic of its stock
market - is impenetrable to foreigners: yet, once again, all the share price
rises come in the first half and virtually all in the first quarter.
Continental European share prices rise and fall in the same way with even
safe, neutral Switzerland moving to the same rhythm.
What can be the explanation of this very regular behaviour of the equity
markets of the developed world? Perhaps it is something to do with the
weather in the northern hemisphere. The timing of harvest receipts and
sowing costs might explain such a seasonal pattern to financial markets in a
predominantly agricultural economy, but that can hardly be the case for
these countries. Anyway, the timing of even agricultural receipts is now
more to do with bureaucratic procedures than to wind and rain.
Even if weather gave some explanation of market movements in the northern
countries, why does tropical Thailand's market follow the same pattern? At
least the timing of the 'annual downturn' is delayed in the southern
hemisphere: New Zealand concentrates its second-half falls into the fourth
quarter.
Latin America, too, is a first-half performer which concentrates its
weakness into the fourth quarter, as do the emerging Asian markets. Only
gold shares and Hong Kong have different seasonal patterns, with falls
common in the first half of the calendar year for gold, while Hong Kong
rises throughout the year on average despite the second-quarter (June) fall
in 1989 after the Beijing massacre.
It is hard to believe that domestic UK events, such as entry to the EMS or
the fall of Thatcher, affected all (or any) of these other markets. The Gulf
war was a more universal event - so far as the doubling of oil prices was
concerned, anyway - but it still seems surprising that there was so little
difference between the market responses of combatants and non-combatants.
A more plausible world-wide link is with Wall Street. The mighty US market
might act as a locomotive for the world's stock markets: tugging the
carriages forward over the Christmas holiday so they all get rolling in the
first quarter of the calendar year; slowing in the spring before stopping
mid-year - and, in the process, inflicting a series of shocks for the next
six months to the little markets following behind.
Naturally, world share prices repeat the pattern. Stock markets go up
sharply in the first quarter, lose momentum in the second and often go into
reverse over the second half of the year.
There is no obvious explanation for it but, whichever equity market you
pick, there is no escape from the seasonal pattern. Who would bet against
that form-book?

FT  18 APR 92 / Finance &amp; the Family: The Week Ahead
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
SmithKline Beecham, the Anglo-American pharmaceuticals and consumer products
group, reports its first quarter results on Thursday. Analysts expect
pre-tax profits to increase about 9 per cent from Pounds 253m last year to
about Pounds 278m.
Underlying growth, excluding currency effects caused by the strong dollar,
will be about 4 per cent, with the pharmaceuticals operations
underperforming that figure.
The small improvement at the pharmaceutical division is because sales of
Tagamet, its anti-ulcer drug, are likely to be static.
In addition, the benefits of the company's new drugs will not yet have
worked their way through, while marketing and sales costs will be high.
A quarterly dividend of about 4.2p per share is forecast compared with 3.75p
last year.
Albert Fisher, the foods group, is expected to report on Thursday a drop in
pre-tax profits for the six months to end February to about Pounds 37m from
Pounds 45m a year-earlier. The dividend could be raised marginally to 1.80p
(1.75p).
The stock has virtually halved over the past year to 72p, a drop the company
called last December 'wholly unjustified'. A hot favourite in the 1980s bull
market, the stock has been knocked by concerns over weakening markets for
some of its products.
Two particular worries are the extent of the slowdown in its North American
food service operations and problems with its Dutch shellfish business.
Wace, the pre-press printing group, will report on Wednesday a decline in
profits after five years of spectacular growth. Pre-tax profits will be
around Pounds 16m-Pounds 18m for 1991 against Pounds 26.5m in 1990 and a
mere Pounds 640,000 back in 1986.
The fall reflects recession in the printing business, not any circumstances
connected to the dramatic resignation January 31 of John Clegg, the young
entrepreneur who built up the company.
The Department of Trade and Industry is investigating potentially unlawful
dealing in shares of two companies Wace acquired or considered acquiring. He
denies any involvement.

FT  18 APR 92 / Finance &amp; the Family: Confused by credit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BARCHARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CONSUMERS wanting a reliable yardstick for the cost of credit need something
better to guide them than the present annual percentage rate (APR)
calculation offered by lenders.
So says Jean Eaglesham, head of money policy at the Consumers' Association.
Eaglesham claims that APRs can sometimes be highly misleading and that few
consumers really understand them.
Only 15 per cent of adults in a 1989 survey knew accurately what an APR is,
though a further 15 per cent had a vague idea. But nearly half of all credit
users said that they took APRs into account when assessing an offer of
credit.
Eaglesham says that the Department of Trade and Industry, which is proposing
ways of making consumers more aware of the risks of borrowing too much,
ought instead to be finding better ways of comparing deals.
Calculating APRs has always been a complex task which can be performed only
by specialists, but the operation has become even less straightforward now
because many financial services products - for example, credit cards -
combine fixed annual fees with interest payments, while the amount borrowed
varies.
So, for example, although Barclaycard Visa's annual charge and interest rate
are both lower than those of Lloyds Access, its APR of 27.8 per cent is 1
per cent higher than the Lloyds Access APR. Why the difference? The two
banks have assumed different amounts of borrowing.
Eaglesham points out that because the cost of the interest-free period for
credit card users was not taken into account for the APR, the card issuers
have been able to push up the real interest they charge borrowers by quietly
scrapping this allowance.
If you are taking out a fixed-rate mortgage, you will probably have
discovered that the nominal rate is a better guide to the monthly payments
you will actually have to make than the published APR.
A more fundamental problem with mortgages is that the costs of any repayment
vehicle, such as a personal equity plan or an endowment policy, are not
included. Eaglesham calculates that on a Pounds 50,000 mortgage for a couple
both aged 40, a pension mortgage adds 3 per cent to the APR and a low-cost
endowment 2 per cent.
Mortgage indemnity policies, compulsory for some borrowers, are also not
included.
So what could be done? Eaglesham has several suggestions. She wants APRs
applied to current account overdraft borrowing (something for which retail
groups have long been pressing). She wants a standard set of assumptions for
each particular type of credit (eg, credit cards), the automatic inclusion
of compulsory costs, and dual APRs to reflect the difference of any optional
costs.
She also suggests that some consumers might find it easier if the APR was
expressed as cash and labelled 'true cost.'

FT  18 APR 92 / Finance &amp; the Family: Day of reckoning for power shares
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PEOPLE who invested in the two privatised Scottish electricity companies,
ScottishPower and Scottish Hydro-Electric, are facing the day of reckoning.
The government is now asking for the 70p second instalment on the shares,
which were issued last year at Pounds 1.
With many another mass-marketed privatisation issue, this would not be a
cause of grief. But the two Scottish companies have been miserable stock
exchange performers. ScottishPower went to a premium of 119p when trading
began in June, but fell back at once. Hydro-Electric touched 124p and then
did likewise.
Many intending stags held on, hoping things would improve. They did not. In
the pre-election gloom, ScottishPower went down to 72p and Hydro-Electric to
73p.
The main reason the shares never sustained a good premium is that the
Scottish companies were the last to be privatised and, with its third shot
at an electricity flotation, the government's advisers finally got the price
right - from the taxpayer's point of view. Both companies were floated with
high gearing - ScottishPower's was 51.4 per cent - and a low dividend yield
of 5.1 per cent.
'They've not been the success story they might have been,' says John Torrie
of Edinburgh stockbroker Torrie &amp; Co. which specialises in private client
business. 'I feel particularly sorry for people who had borrowed to buy
shares and had to sell before the election when the market was afraid not
only of a Labour government but of Scotland becoming independent.'
After the election the price went up to around 100p, and Hydro-Electric
closed on Wednesday at 105p.
The 70p cash call has to be paid by April 29. This week, there has been
heavy trading in both companies as people who do not want to pay the call
throw in the towel, probably barely making a profit, if that.
People who do not pay the 70p (and there is another 70p to be paid in a
year's time) are warned that the Secretary of State for Scotland could take
back the shares and sell them. In this case, they are told, 'you will be
refunded a maximum of Pounds 1 per share less any loss sustained by the
Secretary of State.'
UBS Phillips &amp; Drew and Smith New Court believe the shares are still
undervalued - Smith New Court recommends buying at up to five per cent above
the market yield (ie, 120p).
The brokers argue that the Scottish companies face the least risk of adverse
intervention from the Regulator because, unlike the regional electricity
companies, they were given negative 'x' factors - meaning their tariff
increases must be below inflation.

FT  18 APR 92 / Finance &amp; the Family: The O'Higgins road to riches / Testing
an intriguing investment theory
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRIVATE investors are constantly being told that they should buy shares, and
now that the Conservatives have been re-elected they may be tempted to
plunge into the stock market. But which shares should they buy?
A US fund manager has recently outlined a stock-picking theory which is
beguilingly simple, appears to be remarkably profitable, and also seems to
work in the UK.
The theory, which appears in a US book* by money manager Michael O'Higgins,
is designed to be easy for private investors to use. All you need is the
share price pages of a newspaper, some patience, and an initial slug of
capital.
Between 1973 and 1991, a portfolio chosen by the O'Higgins method produced
annual average returns of 19.4 per cent, compared with 10.4 per cent from
the Dow Jones Industrial Index.
So what is this apparently miraculous theory? All it involves is the 30 blue
chip stocks that make up the Dow Jones Index. The constituents change only
rarely; 12 remain from the original 1928 list.
O'Higgins suggests writing down the Dow stocks and checking, via a
newspaper, the share prices and dividend yields. The first step is to circle
the 10 shares with the highest yields. The next step is to tick off the five
circled stocks with the lowest share prices. Those five shares form the
portfolio for the year.
After one year, the whole exercise can be repeated. O'Higgins says you must
be ruthless and sell stocks which no longer appear in the top five. If one
of the selected stocks drops out of the index, it should be retained till
the end of that year; but cannot qualify as one of the five stocks in
subsequent years.
Now, the wise man is suspicious of such 'wonder theories'. On O'Higgins'
figures, the strategy has not worked every year; only after a number of
years do the advantages begin to tell. But why should it work at all?
In essence, it is just a variation on the age old tactic of 'value
investing'. The yield of a share is merely the dividend expressed as a
percentage of a share price. If share prices fall while dividends are
constant, the yield will rise. So a high yielding stock with a low price is
almost certainly one which has seen a share price decline. One type of
'value investing' is to choose such stocks on the grounds that the decline
has been overdone.
This tactic is far from infallible. Of our four test portfolios started last
July (see page IV), the high yield selection has done the worst. High yield
comes at a price: high risk. In normal markets, if a share yields over 10
per cent, the chances are that many investors do not expect the dividend to
be maintained, or paid at all; and some may fear that the company will go
bust.
The O'Higgins method, by concentrating on only the 30 blue chip Dow Jones
stocks, much reduces the risk of disasters. These are stocks with a long,
relatively stable, history.
Impressed by the simplicity of this theory, I decided to test it in the UK.
The London market has a ready equivalent to the Dow Jones Industrial - the
FT 30 Ordinary Index, first compiled in 1935. This index also consists of
leading blue chip companies, although some of the original components, such
as Fine Spinners and Doublers, have disappeared.
To make the exercise fair, I decided to make some adjustments. The geometric
method for calculating the FT 30 Index makes it a poor measure of investment
performance over a long period (it understates growth). So I decided to use
the FT All-Share Index, acknowledged to be a tough measure to beat, as the
benchmark.
O'Higgins also does not allow, in his calculations, for commissions, or
taxes. I deducted 5 per cent a year for dealing costs from the returns
achieved by the selected portfolio (no costs were taken from All-Share
returns). On taxes, I did not deduct CGT but I did use the net, rather than
gross, dividend yield.
The calculations were made by the simple method of looking up the share
prices and yields in the first edition of the FT each year. Following the
example of O'Higgins, I calculated the returns by adding the dividends for
the year to the capital gain or loss, and expressing the result as a
percentage of the original price.
So, if BT had been bought for 100p, paid 5p in net dividends for the year,
and was sold after one year for 110p, the total return, before costs, would
be 15 per cent.
The return for the All-Share was calculated by adding the yield on the
All-Share at the end of the year to the percentage rise or fall in the index
over the year. So if the index rose from 200 to 210 over the year, and the
net yield at the end was 5 per cent, the return would be 10 per cent.
It also seemed sensible to limit the test to the years since 1979. This is
long enough to test the theory but only covers Conservative administrations.
After following these conditions, the table and the graph show the results.
The 'fiver' portfolio of the high yield, low price FT 30 stocks lagged
behind initially, but pulled ahead in 1983 and has stayed ahead ever since.
A sum of Pounds 10,000 in 1979 would have grown, after all dividends had
been reinvested, into more than Pounds 130,000 by the start of 1992 (an
annual return of just under 22 per cent). The same sum invested in the
All-Share would have grown to around Pounds 81,540 (an annual return of
around 17.5 per cent) .
Just in case dividend reinvestment is impractical, I also worked out the
returns on a capital growth basis alone. The result is much closer (Pounds
68,151 versus Pounds 53,914) but the 'fiver' portfolio is still ahead.
What stocks has this method chosen? In 1981, the five selections would have
been old names such as John Brown, Dunlop, UDS, London Brick and Allied
Breweries. For 1991, the method picked out British Airways, GEC, Hanson,
NatWest Bank and GKN.
Is the theory foolproof? Of course not. Just because it has worked to date
is no guarantee that it will work in future. It is often the case that as
soon as a pricing anomaly is discovered, and investors try to exploit it, it
disappears. A FT 30 stock might collapse entirely (it happened to British
Leyland); the stock market might have changed fundamentally after Britain's
entry into the Exchange Rate Mechanism.
One should be particularly wary of assuming that the nominal returns
achieved between 1979 and 1991 can be repeated. That seems highly unlikely,
although real (after inflation) returns may still be healthy. The system is
aiming to beat the All-Share rather than to produce any particular level of
absolute return. But as in 1990, one can beat the All-Share and still lose
money.
On average, one is required to sell three stocks each year. If more stocks
are needed to be sold, or if the portfolio is lower than the suggested size
of Pounds 10,000, costs may be higher than I have estimated.
In addition, you can see from the table that the system has outperformed the
All-Share in eight years, and underperformed in five. The next two or three
years may be underperformers.
Private investors will also be aware that broader diversification than just
five stocks is generally agreed to be the best strategy. In summary, anyone
tempted to try this system should be both patient and alert to the dangers.
Having said that, which stocks would the system select now? The FT 30
currently consists of: Allied Lyons, Asda, BICC, BOC, BTR, Blue Circle,
Boots, British Airways, British Gas, BP, BT, Cadbury Schweppes, Courtaulds,
Forte, GEC, Glaxo, Grand Met, GKN, Guinness, Hanson, ICI, Lucas, Marks &amp;
Spencer, NatWest, P&amp;O, Reuters, Royal Insurance, Smithkline Beecham, Tate &amp;
Lyle, and Thorn EMI.
Using Friday's FT, the ten constituents with the highest yields were: Asda
(8.9), BP (8.7), BICC (7.9), P&amp;O (7.5), Royal Insurance (7.5), Lucas (7.3),
NatWest (7.3), GKN (7.0), British Gas (6.7) and Hanson (6.2). The five of
those with the lowest share prices were: Asda (31.5), Lucas (128), Royal
Insurance (201), Hanson (235.5) and BP (257).
There would be high risks attached to such a portfolio. Both Asda and Royal
Insurance passed their final dividends recently, and the yields shown relate
solely to the previous interims. This is not a selection for the cautious.

FT  18 APR 92 / Markets (Wall Street): Dow bounds ahead on recovery hopes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HERE COMES the recovery. In the last week a host of US corporations have
reported first quarter earnings that exceeded market forecasts, an
indication that business conditions have improved significantly since the
end of last year.
The good news gave Wall Street a rush of energy. In the first five trading
days of the quarterly reporting season the Dow Jones index jumped 172
points, or 5.4 per cent, setting record highs as investors rushed into big
industrial and cyclical stocks in anticipation of a sustained recovery in
corporate profitability.
Admittedly, the broader market fared less well, with the Standard &amp; Poor's
500 holding below its all-time high and the Nasdaq composite of
over-the-counter stocks still handicapped by the hangover among
biotechnology issues. The underlying tone of the market, however, remains
firm, aided by the fact that last week's unexpected policy ease suggests the
Federal Reserve is prepared to put its foot down on the monetary accelerator
any time the recovery looks like stalling.
The recent evidence, however, indicates that the corporate economy is
picking up speed. Aluminum Company of America, known as Alcoa, opened the
season with first quarter profits of Dollars 76m, three times better than
the consensus of analysts' forecasts. The reward was a 12 per cent jump in
Alcoa's share price over the following three days.
After Alcoa, results tumbled out, revealing higher earnings across a
spectrum of US industry. Goodyear, Hilton Hotels, IBM, International Paper,
American Home Products, Pfizer and CBS were some of the big names to report
improved profits that exceeded expectations.
Unsurprisingly, in the wake of buoyant financial markets and heavy stock and
bond underwriting activity, the biggest first quarter gains were seen from
Wall Street itself, with securities houses J P Morgan, PaineWebber, Bear
Stearns and Charles Schwab all posting record profits.
If the first quarter is turning out to have been the opening stage in
Corporate America's recovery, the rest of 1992 should see companies building
on those gains. According to the Institutional Brokers Estimate System
(IBES), which tracks Wall Street earnings estimates, corporate profits are
forecast to rise 41 per cent this year.
The heavy demand for stocks from investors this past week suggests they have
placed their faith in the forecasts, because stocks look expensive at the
moment in terms of past earnings, with the S&amp;P 500 currently selling at
about 26 times trailing earnings. The index, however, sells at just over 18
times prospective 1992 earnings if the IBES numbers are used, which makes
the market look more affordable.
The underlying economy is also perkier, judging by this week's economic
numbers. At first glance the February business inventories
(unchanged-to-lower), and the March retail sales (down 0.4 per cent) and
industrial production (up just 0.2 per cent) numbers inspired little
confidence.
However, a closer examination revealed that business inventories were flat
or weaker because companies continued to run down stocks to meet increased
demand. Retail sales were lower on the month, but over the first quarter
real retail sales (adjusted for inflation) increased sharply, the biggest
gain since late 1988. As for industrial production, the monthly increase was
modest, but on an annual comparison March industrial production was up 2.1
per cent, reflecting a recovery in output last summer.
The performance of US stock markets this week was especially impressive
considering that the derivatives markets in Chicago were out of action for
most of the week because of flooding. The lack of futures and options
trading meant stock market traders in New York could not hedge their trades
with index options and futures, and program traders could not participate in
computerised stock index arbitrage.
This kept volume down and reduced volatility in stock prices. For several of
the older dealers on Wall Street it was all a happy reminder of the 'good
old days', when equity markets were untroubled by the machinations of
program traders.

<TEXT>
Will the present recession repeat some of the trends of the great Depression
of the early 1930s? Could entry into the Exchange Rate Mechanism result in a
long period of low inflation and low interest rates? And what will that mean
for investors? The parallels are discussed in the FT Quarterly Review of
Personal Finance, published with next Friday's paper and repeated with
Saturday's. The review also contains its normal wide-ranging coverage of the
savings market, including a special survey on investment trusts.

FT  18 APR 92 / Markets (At a glance): Docklands EZT blow
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
There was more bad news for Docklands enterprise zone trust investors this
week. Investors in PET 8, which owns Two Exchange Tower, have been asked to
defer the rent they are owed. This rent is in many cases used to pay off the
loans with which investors have funded their investment, and extra tax
relief is available if this is done.
Globe Trust, the private property company formerly called Charter Group,
guaranteed the income from its 250,000 sq ft office building, which is still
only 40 per cent let. It has asked the trust's investors to defer the rent,
which is Pounds 5m a year, until it has solved its liquidity problems by
making a property sale.

The rise in gilt prices after the re-election of the Conservatives means
that government bonds have recouped the losses they suffered during the
run-up to the election and the Chancellor's surprise announcement of a

FT  18 APR 92 / Markets (At a glance): Germany is key to rate cut
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Hopes are high that the government can reduce interest rates following the
re-election, but the key factor may be Germany. As the graph shows, the gap
between UK and German interest rates is low by the standards of the last 13
years. Although UK inflation has fallen, it remains to be seen whether
investors would accept a lower return on sterling than on mark deposits. Any
substantial fall in UK rates may thus have to await action by the
Bundesbank.

FT  18 APR 92 / Markets (Serious Money): Putting the case for equities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Personal Finance Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MANY PRIVATE investors will be disillusioned with shares. If they were
sucked in at the top of the bull market in 1987, they will still have seen
only a small profit after five years. And of course, many will have sold out
immediately after the Crash, at a loss, and vowed never to touch equities
again.
Now there are some interesting alternatives to shares, such as National
Savings and index-linked gilts. But for those who intend to live off their
savings for a long period, history shows that it would be foolish to ignore
equities altogether. For periods of a decade or more, they beat building
society returns by a street.
It is one thing to decide to invest in shares; quite another thing to know
how to go about it. Over the next few pages, we suggest both the
practicalities and a variety of strategies for stock picking.
Picking your own stocks probably requires an equity portfolio of at least
Pounds 10,000 and many would argue that Pounds 25,000 or more is required.
For those with less than that sum, or those who do not want the aggravation
of making their own stock selections, an investment or a unit trust is the
sensible route into equities.
In the last financial year, investment trusts were the fashionable vehicle.
Investors seized the chance to put Pounds 6,000 into new issues and qualify
for the full Personal Equity Plan allowance, while existing trusts were
limited to Pounds 3,000: 21 trusts raised a total of Pounds 780m.
This was a classic case of tax relief distorting a market, rather as life
assurance premium relief once steered investors towards endowments. Now that
the distortion has been removed, and the political prospects for the next
five years are stable, it may be a time for a rethink of some of last year's
investment decisions. Broker Credit Lyonnais Laing, in its new yearbook for
1992, is dubious about the merits of some of the 1991-92 new issues and
believes that the bubble may be about to burst.
Analyst Peter Walls worries that 'sophisticated capital structures were used
to convince relatively unsophisticated investors that discounts are
irrelevant.'
The point here is that the market value of investment trusts and the value
of their portfolios are not the same thing. The price of investment shares
is set by supply and demand, and can move up and down even though the assets
in the portfolio are unchanged.
Traditionally, the value of the investment trust shares has been lower than
that of the portfolio. In the jargon, the shares trade at a discount. Say
the trust had 100m shares and assets of Pounds 100m. Assets per share would
be 100p, but the share price might trade at 90p, a discount of 10 per cent.
Buying investment trust shares at a discount thus allows the investor to get
extra assets for his or her money. But many of the new issues have been
trading at a premium to their asset values. In other words, investors are
paying, say, 100p, for assets of 90p.
The argument has been that by creating a split capital structure - issuing
separate classes of shares for income and capital growth - trusts have
increased overall demand for their shares and thus eliminated the problem of
the discount. Walls argues that this might be an illusion. When one lumps
all the split capital shares together, you end up with a conventional
investment trust. This is especially true for investors who bought a package
of split shares; they have the equivalent of an ordinary share in a
conventional investment trust.
The conundrum therefore is: why own package shares in a split capital issue
at a premium, when one can buy shares in a conventional investment trust at
a discount?
As Walls expresses it, the investor knows 'that over the remaining life of
the trust, the market value of the package has to underperform the
underlying assets of the trust'.
There was a sensible reason for buying such trusts last year, when the new
issue was the only way of getting a tax free Pounds 6,000 portfolio. I felt
at the time that the M&amp;G Income Trust had attractions to income-seeking
investors, since it offered a 6.55 per cent tax free yield, the equivalent
of 10.9 per cent gross to top rate taxpayers.
The package shares now stand at 102p, slightly above the issue price of
100p. But they are trading at a premium to assets of 7 per cent. Now that
the government has changed the rules, there is a case for transferring the
sum into a conventional investment trust which is standing at a discount.
You might see a short term drop in income, depending on the new trust
selected, but transfer charges would be relatively low and long term capital
growth might be higher (because of the discount effect).
Whether or not a transfer seems sensible depends on how much of your
portfolio is tied up in the trust. If it is a substantial proportion, then a
transfer may provide a useful diversification of risk. If the investment is
only a small proportion of your portfolio, then one may decide that M&amp;G is
as likely to manage the money well as anyone else. And one should check the
costs of any transfer very carefully; high charges would eliminate the
potential benefits.
These arguments apply to all the new issues of last year which are on a
premium, not just M&amp;G Income. Changes in tax rules often require investors
to be flexible about their portfolios.

FT  18 APR 92 / Markets (The Bottom Line): Hotels sector still has room to
improve
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LAST YEAR was awful, the company says. Pre-tax profits down 62 per cent,
earnings per share down 68 per cent. This year looks better, but not much.
We are maintaining our dividend, but it is only 60 per cent covered by
earnings. We are much too dependent on the UK and that will not change for
at least five years.
No problem, says the City. We'll mark your shares up 4p on that splendid
news, just 2p shy of the year's high. Is a historic multiple of, say, 42 all
right? A prospective price earnings ratio of 23?
There cannot be many companies that investors treat with the same
understanding as Forte, the hotels, contract catering and restaurants group,
which reported full-year profits of Pounds 73m last Wednesday, down from
Pounds 190m in 1990.
Compare Forte's rating with that of Queens Moat Houses, another hotel
company, which announced its results a week earlier. Queens Moat's pre-tax
profits were down only 3.9 per cent to Pounds 90.4m. The company survived
the UK and US recessions by reducing its dependence on the British market,
something Forte has been promising to do for some time. Queens Moat trades
on a historic and prospective multiple of 10.
Hotel companies should be easier for investors to evaluate than
organisations which manufacture pharmaceuticals or electronic devices. We
have all stayed in hotels: we are in a position to evaluate the quality of
service. The management's willingness or reluctance to negotiate a discount
on the room rate and a quick glance at how many tables are full at breakfast
should help us to decide how well or badly the establishment is doing.
Forte and Queens Moat demonstrate the weakness of this common-sense
approach. The market appears to have its own reasons for favouring Forte and
disliking Queens Moat. Some analysts say Queens Moat is out of fashion
because the City does not like its depreciation policy. Other point to its
frequent rights issues - seven since 1980.
Peter Joseph of Smith New Court says that because Queens Moat has weathered
the past year reasonably well there is less scope for a spectacular
recovery. Forte's poorer performance means the bounce back to health will be
more impressive, although he warns that that is still some years off.
Paul Slattery of Kleinwort Benson says the reason the two companies have
such different ratings is that Forte simply has a better understanding of
how to handle shareholders.
'Forte have spent a lot of time with shareholders - doing presentations,
entertaining them and keeping them informed about what they are planning and
what the potential outcomes are. About 15 per cent of Forte's shares are
held by Scottish institutions, which are well-known for their long-term
view. Many in the London market hold Forte as a core holding, as a long-term
hold. Over the past year, as earnings have collapsed, there have been few
sellers.
'Queens Moat, on the other hand, is still regarded, and still regards
itself, as an emerging company,' he says. The company spends less time
explaining itself to its shareholders.
Slattery does not expect Forte's profits to justify its share price until
the year to end-January 1995. That it is a long time to wait. The shares, in
the meantime, are expensive for anyone wanting to invest in the company.
Queens Moat shares are cheaper. But forecasts of the company's future
performance differ. Queens Moat gained 42 per cent of its profits last year
from hotels in Continental Europe. Although its 104 UK hotels suffered
through the Gulf War and the recession, its 86 Continental hotels recorded
solid performances. Profits in both Germany and the Netherlands rose 20 per
cent.
The company is cautious about its performance for this year, saying growth
will not resume until 1993. Where analysts differ is over prospects for the
Continental hotels. Some worry that the German market is about to suffer.
Others believe the Continental hotels will prove their resilience.
One company has no doubt that the Continent is the place to be. Forte, the
market's favourite, says it has several Continental properties in its
sights.

FT  18 APR 92 / Markets (London): A curious lack of enthusiasm
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARTIN, Financial Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When the Birmingham and Midland Bank started business in the summer of 1836,
it began the longest unbroken history as a shareholders' company of any of
the English clearing banks. That history is now, it seems, drawing to a
close. Midland Bank, as it is known these days, has agreed to be taken over
by a bank thirty years its junior, the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking
Corporation.
Tuesday's Pounds 3.1bn bid for Midland by HSBC Holdings, the Hongkong Bank's
parent company, may not succeed: shareholders may decide not to follow their
board's advice to sell out, and there is also the possibility of a
counter-bid by Lloyds. Still, the odds currently favour the Hongkong bid.
There has been something a bit odd, however, about the events surrounding
this week's announcement of the terms of the bid. Mr Brian Pearse, the
ex-Barclays man who has been Midland's chief executive for a year, said all
that was proper as he endorsed the Hongkong offer.
It was clearly the right thing to do, he said, adding that he was personally
excited by the challenge of making the takeover work. Seldom has anyone so
excited sounded quite so mournful, however.
A similar ambivalence showed up in the stock market's reaction. Only three
months ago, Midland Bank was trading at 208p. HSBC's offer, valued at 378p a
share on Tuesday, represented an 82 per cent premium over that price, and a
6p premium over Monday's closing price.
Since then, Midland's shares have drifted down; HSBC's shares have risen.
The Kuwait Investment Office spent much of Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday
attempting to find a buyer for the bulk of its 10 1/2 per cent stake in
Midland - initially asking 362p, then settling for 356p. By Thursday's
close, the Hongkong bid was worth 396p, and the Midland price was 362p.
The lack of enthusiasm shown all round - by the KIO in selling its stake; by
the market in pushing Midland's share price away from the offer rather than
towards it; by Lloyds in not snapping up the KIO stake - is curious. The two
alternative futures for Midland, after all, are genuinely exciting ones. If
the Hongkong bid prevails, Midland will form part of a big new London-based
banking group, a significant addition to the FT-SE; if Lloyds were to bid,
win, and pass the regulators' scrutiny, the acquisition and dismemberment of
Midland would transform the UK banking sector. Either way, there is a lot at
issue for investors. You would be hard put to tell by watching the stock
market, however.
Perhaps portfolio managers have been too busy watching the FT-SE to pay
attention to its constituents. On Thursday morning, the index touched
2673.4, only six points away from its all-time closing high of 2679.6, set
in September 1991. It dropped back in the course of Thursday, however, to
close at 2638.6, a 66-point gain since the previous Friday and a 202-point
rise since the Conservative election victory.
Political enthusiasm does not explain all this rise. Investors have
obviously been allowing themselves to believe that the economic recovery,
signalled by a few indicators earlier in the year, is at last under way.
February figures for industrial production, published on Tuesday, showed a
rise of 1.1 per cent, well above economists' expectations. The seasonally
adjusted index of manufacturing output is now back at levels last seen in
the autumn.
On Friday, the statisticians reported that the number of people out of work
at any time had risen by one million since the recession started. But the
figures also provided some glimmer of hope: seasonally adjusted unemployment
in March rose by 7,400, the smallest monthly increase since unemployment
started rising in May 1990. In the three months to February, the average
increase in unemployment was over 42,000.
The enthusiasm for shopping and house-hunting displayed over the four-day
Easter weekend will provide a guide to whether those economists expecting
essentially flat output this year are right; or whether the correct answer
lies with those who expect at least 1 1/2 per cent gdp growth as the pent-up
demand of consumers spills into the High Street.
The shopper with the Visa card was not urged on, despite some market
expectations to the contrary, by a cut in official interest rates. Short
term interest rates firmed very slightly in the course of the week, with the
rate implied by the short sterling futures contract rising from 10.03 per
cent at Friday's close to 10.20 by the end of Thursday. The pound clambered
creakily off the floor of the ERM, potentially increasing the latitude for a
lower base rate. But mildly discouraging news on inflation in both Germany
and the UK probably counted against an immediate interest rate cut.
Results reported this week included some dreadful figures and write-offs
from big construction groups. Tarmac's pre-tax profits for 1991 fell nearly
90 per cent to Pounds 21m, and the company cut the final dividend to 2 1/2 p
from 8 1/4 p.
Mowlem's full-year profits fell from Pounds 34m to Pounds 3m before tax. It
cut the final dividend from 15.35p to 4.85p, though the company's chairman,
Sir Philip Beck, sounded encouraging about the outlook. Taylor Woodrow,
under a new chairman, reported a loss before tax of Pounds 2.7m, against a
profit of Pounds 83.4m a year ago. The company is pulling out of US
contracting, and has cut 600 jobs.
Higgs and Hill reported the worst figures, a 1991 loss of Pounds 16.7m,
against profits of Pounds 6.8m the year before. But its chief executive, Mr
John Theakston, offered the best summary of the past year: 'It's not been a
lot of fun out there,' he said.

FT  18 APR 92 / The Long View: Inflation puts up a fight
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARRY RILEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WILL THE real inflation rate please stand up (or preferably, fall down)?
Is it the government's headline figure of 4 per cent for March, or should we
believe some other figure? The year-on-year factory gate inflation rate for
manufactured goods was 4.5 per cent last month, for example. Excluding
housing, inflation is still 7.3 per cent. Certainly the Germans tend to
protest at British political claims that retail price inflation in the UK
has now fallen below the German rate of 4.7 per cent. German calculations
are distorted upwards by factors like tax increases, while British figures
are being massaged downwards by cuts in mortgage rates and manipulation of
poll taxes.
The technicalities of this are tedious, but there are signs that British
inflation is proving resistant to the recession. Annual rises in average
earnings have never fallen below 7 per cent on an underlying basis for more
than 20 years: the average British worker expects a decent pay increase
every year, come hell or low inflation. On the February calculation released
this week the 7 per cent barrier has still not been breached. Of course, the
continuing gap between pay inflation and price inflation may help explain
why the government was voted back into power.
In the circumstances the British economy has become divided into two. That
part exposed to external realities - especially the manufacturing sector -
has had to bring down its inflation rate, although it has been helped by
stable commodity price inputs. But the domestic economy has gone on its own
sweet way. The past year's inflation in most household and personal services
has been 7 or 8 per cent.
Now, however, the government has a rare opportunity to address this problem
head on. In the past I have expressed doubts about whether the British
electorate would really vote for anti-inflationary policies, but after the
re-election of John Major I have to eat my words. The gilt-edged market
celebrated by pushing the yields on fixed income government securities
sharply lower. Significantly, the index-linked issues noticeably missed out
on the euphoria. So the buyers were not anticipating any fall in real
interest rates, but were cutting expectations of inflation, now down to an
implied 4.5 per cent.
Can sterling now be turned into a hard currency? There are now no fears of
hung parliaments, temporary governments or soft-hearted socialist regimes.
Sterling has zoomed by about 8 pfennigs against the DM over the past week or
so; pretty soon it could even be looking the DM straight between the eyes at
2.95 to the Pounds . Sentiment can alter in strange ways; chaos in Eastern
Europe this summer could undermine the DM.
International investors tend to place a premium on political stability,
especially of the right of centre variety. Around the world just now there
is not a great deal of this to be had. The Americans are taking significant
financial risks in the interests of the re-election of George Bush. The
Japanese one-party state has not turned out entirely to represent political
stability, let alone financial equilibrium. France is still run by
socialists, albeit of the market-friendly variety, and faces its own
elections within a year or so.
One snag is the British trade gap. Hard currencies do not usually rub
shoulders easily with balance of payments deficits. But this need not be a
great problem so long as foreigners are keen to buy British government
bonds. Indeed, it follows that if the government is financing its swelling
budget deficit in large part by selling bonds overseas then there must be a
current account deficit to match the capital inflow across the exchanges. If
at some stage in the future British financial institutions wake up to the
appeal of sterling bonds and displace the foreigners from the gilts
auctions, ironically sterling then could start to slide.
But the devaluationists lurking in the wings will argue that the British
economy needs a hard currency like a hole in the head, and they have a
point. What it needs is sharply lower interest rates. The virtuous circle is
that a strong economy leads to a firm currency and to lower interest rates.
This is how it used to be in Germany. The UK is coming from the other
direction: somebody else's high interest rates (Germany's) are generating
firmness in the currency which is leading to a weak economy. The current
economic strategy is pointing to an employment crisis, as the jobless total
heads towards 3m, and to a financial crisis, as interest accrues at real
rates of 7 per cent or more on vast corporate and personal debts.
Chancellor Norman Lamont has been much abused for his suggestion last year
that this economic distress is a price well worth paying to beat inflation.
But 42 per cent of the electorate may have, in a manner of speaking, agreed
within him. At any rate Major and Lamont now have the opportunity to seek a
non-inflationary way out of Britain's economic mess without worrying too
much about short-term unpopularity.
How? Well, there has to be something close to a pay freeze over the next
couple of years. In the public sector this might be arranged through deft
handling of a public spending crisis with an appropriate package of cuts. In
the private sector a high exchange rate will help maintain pressure,
although the stock market should be aware that profits will be squeezed as
well as wages.
As for the debt overhang, the repayment priority is bound to keep the
economy under restraint for several years. There is a big cash flow into the
investment institutions of up to Pounds 50bn a year which could help in the
refinancing, but government guarantees might be required. More about this
anon.
Meanwhile, I have no official figures for chocolate Easter egg inflation,
but on the basis of limited private sampling it is a lot more than 4 per
cent.

FT  18 APR 92 / The Lex Column: Worcester
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
There is something rather curious about Bosch's agreed Pounds 72m takeover
of Worcester Group. A historic multiple of 22 might seem generous enough for
a maker of central heating boilers. But Worcester is recovering rapidly from
recession, and its own brokers expect earnings growth of over 20 per cent
this year and over 30 per cent next. The 225p offer is only 20 per cent
above the previous market price, which seems a meagre premium given the
obvious benefits from putting the UK's and Germany's leading boiler makers
together.
Even odder is the fact that Worcester's management will be bought out of its
32 per cent holding in four years, at a price up to 75 per cent higher than
outside shareholders are being offered. Granted, the price could also be
much lower, depending on results. But the outside holders are being paid
according to Worcester's past performance. The management will be paid
according to the benefits derived from synergies with Bosch. Since Bosch
already has control, there seems little to be done about the situation. It
leaves a sour taste all the same.

FT  18 APR 92 / The Lex Column: Eurotunnel
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Even by their own wobbly standards, Eurotunnel shares are behaving nervously
ahead of next Friday's preliminary results. Having drifted back steadily but
uneventfully since mid-January, the price fell a full 6 per cent this week
on renewed fears that the long-rumoured refinancing is about to be be
announced.
After last month's ruling from the independent disputes panel that
Eurotunnel must triple its monthly payments to the 10 Anglo-French
contractors, it would be unwise to expect convincing reassurances from Sir
Alastair Morton. However, stories that the company delayed its results
because of an immediate financial crisis, and that the cash call is
imminent, belong to wilder reaches of the market's imagination. The chances
are that the Eurotunnel chief executive will want to tough it out; and
though the odds may seem tilted against him, he may just have the cards to
succeed.
The only certainty is that the 1996 peak financing requirement of Pounds
8.05bn will be increased in the light of lower GDP forecasts, changed duty
free assumptions and the delay in the opening of the tunnel until autumn
1993. Even factoring in the most disadvantageous settlement of the claims
dispute, the eagerly awaited revised figure might still be Pounds 200m short
of Eurotunnel's overall financial limits. While that leaves little room for
anything else to go wrong, the rights issue - if it comes - at least ought
to be relatively small. The risk of the banks foreclosing looks politically
negligible, and they might even be persuaded to permit a small overrun in
the hope that the traffic forecasts ultimately prove conservative. The
shares hardly seem worth selling.

FT  18 APR 92 / The Lex Column: Midland
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The fact that Midland Bank's shares now languish 9 per cent below the value
of Hongkong Bank's offer suggests that the bid could be in trouble. The 6
per cent rise in Hongkong Bank shares since the terms were announced also
suggests the reason: HSBC's shareholders, like Midland's, think the offer is
cheap.
HSBC has not been helped by Kuwait's decision to sell most of its 10 per
cent stake in the market for only 355p. Other Midland investors clearly also
have doubts about the banking conglomerate that would result from the
merger. With the market unreceptive to large offers of Midland paper,
institutions apparently face an awkward choice. In the absence of a
counter-bid they either have to go along with the HSBC terms or risk
Midland's share price falling back to where it started.
There does not seem to be much that HSBC can do to improve its offer. The
regulators would probably frown on the drain of capital implicit in a cash
offer. Increasing the equity component would provoke a counter-productive
fall in the HSBC price. Offering more loan stock would risk undermining the
reception for what is already an exceptionally large issue of subordinated
bank debt. It looks as though, having painted Midland's management into a
corner, HSBC is trying to do the same to its shareholders. If the bid
failed, though, another suitor such as Lloyds could take HSBC's place
without having to mount a hostile bid. The downside risk of rejection might
not be as great as it first appears.

FT  18 APR 92 / The Lex Column: London back on track
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The London equity market's response to the Tory election victory has proved
more robust and durable than some at first expected, this column included.
Perhaps the most encouraging sign came on Thursday, when the market ground
to a halt in heavy two-way volume. This suggested that the near-250 point
rise of the previous five trading days was a genuine adjustment to changed
circumstances, rather than a bubble waiting to be pricked.
One rationale of what has been happening is illustrated in the chart. Last
September, the market reached its all-time high on the basis of premature
hopes of economic recovery and the belief the Tories would sweep to victory
in a November election. Then came disappointment on both counts, and a 12
per cent plunge by Christmas. This was followed by a revival, briefly
punctured by the panic of the election itself. The revival is now back on
track, with the FT-SE a mere 41 points below its September high.
It could be argued that the record now deserves to be beaten, on the grounds
that the market is once more free from the perception of political risk and
must necessarily be closer to the reality of economic recovery. The main
reservation remains the fact that evidence of recovery is likely to be
meagre and uncertain for some time. Even Thursday's unexpectedly good
employment figures came with unexpectedly bad news on wage inflation, thus
suggesting the need for continued monetary restraint. The market gains of
the past week look fairly secure. From now on, though, the going could prove
less exciting.

FT  18 APR 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Milan shrugs off De Benedetti
news
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MOST BOURSES were closed for Easter yesterday, with the exception of Milan,
while Madrid, Oslo and Copenhagen were also closed on Thursday. The Spanish
market will be open on Easter Monday, writes Our Markets Staff.
MILAN extended Thursday's gains on the second day of the new account. The
Comit index rose 4.57 to 507.58, a gain of 1.3 per cent on the week, after
rising 3.47 to 503.01 on Thursday. Turnover fell to around L63bn from
Thursday's L78bn.
Shares controlled by Mr Carlo De Benedetti recovered from Thursday's falls,
caused by the unexpected news that he had been sentenced to more than six
years in jail for his involvement in the 1982 bankruptcy of the former Banco
Ambrosiano.
Olivetti gained L55 to L2,660 after dropping L75 or 2.7 per cent to L2,605
on Thursday. Cir gained L61 to L1,568 after falling 1.2 per cent or L19 to
L1,507 the previous day.
Several large block trades in Euromobiliare, San Paolo and Alenia were
reported on Thursday and Friday.
PARIS flirted with the 2,000 level on the CAC-40 index on Thursday before
falling back on profit-taking. The CAC-40 went as high as 2,000.58 before
closing 12.48 lower at 1,978.21, little changed on the week, in moderate
turnover of FFr2.9bn.
Peugeot fell FFr19 to FFr713 as investors were disappointed that the company
had cut the 1991 dividend.
Euro Disney weakened further, losing FFr4.30 or 3.1 per cent to FFr132 with
1.03m shares traded. Analysts said the stock could fall as low as FFr120 in
the near term as investors continued to switch into the parent company.
Beghin-Say rose FFr17 to FFr646 after some French brokers issued positive
notes on the company's merger with Eridania of Italy.
Cerus, another Franco-Italian company, dropped FFr7 or 4.9 per cent to
FFr137 on news of Mr Carlo De Benedetti's sentencing.
FRANKFURT was dull ahead of the Easter holiday. The DAX index rose 5.44 to
1,749.53 on Thursday for a 0.7 per cent gain over the week. The FAZ index,
calculated at midsession, was 2.07 stronger at 711.16, up 0.6 per cent on
the week, while turnover fell to DM5.1bn from DM5.6bn.
The Cartel Office said that it would approve the planned merger between
steel groups Krupp and Hoesch after the former said it would sell its car
suspension division. Krupp lost DM3.50 to DM135.50 while Hoesch gained DM2
to DM252.
Siemens slipped 20 pfg to DM688.10. Earlier trading in Siemens-Nixdorf (SNI)
shares, the computer division of the electronics group, was suspended after
Siemens said that it had completed the integration of SNI.
Robert Fleming in London has issued a sell note on Siemens saying that
forecasts for cost-cutting and growth at SNI are over-optimistic.
ZURICH closed firmer with the expiry of share options and futures having
little affect on the market. The SMI index closed up 1.4 at 1,871.3 on
Thursday for a 2.3 per cent gain on the week.
Among the banks, UBS bearers rose SFr20 to SFr3,880 while CS Holding bearers
advanced SFr10 to SFr1,985.
Georg Fischer remained active with its bearers SFr40 higher at SFr1,050 and
registered shares SFr15 firmer at SFr195.
AMSTERDAM closed mixed on Thursday. The CBS Tendency Index gained 0.1 to
126.5, a rise of 2.2 per cent on the week.
Wolters Kluwer was Fl 1 stronger at Fl 75 following its forecast of stronger
profits growth.
There was little reaction to ING's announcement that it expects profits this
year to match its 1991 results. Shares in the banking and insurance group
slipped 30 cents to Fl 51.60.
Borsumij slipped back Fl 1.40 to Fl 62.80 following its confirmation earlier
in the week of a 70 per cent decline in 1991 net profit. The trading group
is anticipating an improvement in 1992 earnings.
Unilever improved further, rising Fl 1.90 to Fl 190.50.
STOCKHOLM closed higher in thin, pre-holiday trade on Thursday. The
Affarsvarlden general index rose 4.9 to 989.2, up 1.4 per cent on the week,
as turnover fell to SKr378m from SKr573m.
The real estate and construction sector jumped 2.6 per cent, following SKr7
gain to SKr118 in Skanska B shares after the company indicated an
improvement in profit in the current year.
BRUSSELS fell from Thursday's highs on late profit-taking. The Bel-20 Index
ended up 4.56 at 1,196.17, up 1.5 per cent on the week. The pharmaceutical
group UCB climbed BFr550 or 2.5 per cent to BFr22,200.

FT  18 APR 92 / World Stock Markets: Resurrection of optimism as recession
is receding - The Australian market is ready to advance after a poor showing
in the last quarter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE AUSTRALIAN Stock Exchange has suffered a severe attack of vertigo over
the last three months, wiping out the modest gains made during rallies in
November and January.
But brokers remain confident that a substantial advance is likely over the
remainder of the year as the domestic economy recovers from recession.
The Australian market has been one of the world's poorest performers since
the global crash in 1987, when the All Ordinaries Index slumped from 2,300
to 1,150 in a couple of months.
In spite of repeated attempts to talk up the market, the index has never
since exceeded 1,800, and is currently trading at around 1,580 - roughly the
level it reached in mid-1988 at the end of the initial post-crash upswing.
It closed on Thursday at 1,590.
There were hopes of a solid advance in the second half of last year, and
again in January, when the index looked likely to break through the
psychologically important 1,700 barrier. But both rallies petered out in the
face of recession, political instability, and weakness in overseas markets.
Much of the nervousness is related to a flood of disappointing results from
major companies for the six months to December, which were combined with
warnings that little improvement could be expected in the current half.
Investors have also been deterred by bad economic news from the US, the UK
and Japan, which tend to set the tone for the Australian market. There is
particular concern about the possibility of a recession in Japan, which
takes about 26 per cent of Australian exports, mostly in the form of raw
commodities which form the feedstock for many of Japan's consumer
industries.
For this reason, the recent dramatic fall in the Tokyo market has done much
to unsettle Australian investors, in spite of indications that the Japanese
economy will continue to grow over the coming year, albeit at a modest rate.
Optimists also point out that most of Australia's exports to Japan are
commodities such as iron ore and coal which are the subject of long-term
contracts. Japanese buyers have sometimes varied the terms of the contracts
in difficult periods, but none has ever been cancelled, probably because it
is in the buyers' interest to maintain secure sources of supply in
Australia.
Even if Japan does move into recession, the impact on Australia should be
offset by increasing sales to the rest of Asia, which now takes about 19 per
cent of Australian exports (excluding New Zealand). Most of the dynamic
economies of the region are expected to continue to grow quickly in the
short term, whatever happens in Tokyo.
The domestic economy is also looking healthier than for some time, as it
emerges from six successive quarters of flat or negative growth - the worst
recession since 1983. Changes in statistical definitions have clouded the
picture, but gross domestic product grew by 0.4 per cent on the income-based
measure in the three months to December, and further growth is confidently
predicted by most economists for the quarter to March.
Most of the indicators are now pointing in the right direction - housing
finance approvals, for example, jumped by 13.7 per cent in February, and the
widely watched Westpac-Melbourne Institute index of consumer sentiment has
improved by 21 per cent since January.
In addition, a ADollars 2.3bn public spending stimulus announced in February
should shortly begin to have an impact on the depressed construction sector.
A slow recovery is taking place in the rural sector - still an important
export industry - and some analysts say there is substantial potential for a
significant improvement in the resources sector as base metals producers
reap the benefits of forecast falls in inventories of metals such as copper,
lead and tin.
Both farm producers and miners will be helped by a fall in the value of the
Australian dollar, which is trading at around 76 US cents, compared to a
peak of more than 80 cents in September.
Most economists believe improvements in commodity prices will continue to
prop up the Australian dollar, in spite of a fall in official interest rates
to 7.5 per cent from a peak of 18 per cent in late 1989.
Many think the resilience of the dollar, combined with a fall in inflation
to 1.5 per cent, has opened the way for a further 0.5 per cent in cut in
official rates in the next few months.
The bond markets have begun to reflect that view in recent weeks, pushing
short-term bills down to 7.3 per cent.
All these factors should add up to a return to sufficient growth to
guarantee the formal end of the recession when the March quarter figures are
released in June.
If that happens, it may be enough to trigger a recovery in confidence, which
many brokers feel would propel the index towards the elusive 1,800 barrier.
But after the disappointments of the last couple of years, few investors
will be willing to bet their shirts on it.

FT  18 APR 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Triple-witching hour lifts
Dow to new high
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
AFTER five days of solid gains, US stock markets appeared to be running out
of steam on Thursday, although late buying linked to the expiration of stock
index options and futures lifted shares to new highs, writes Patrick
Harverson in New York.
At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 12.74 at 3,366.50,
having spent all but the last few minutes of the day's trading only a few
points either side of opening values. The more broadly based Standard &amp;
Poor's 500 ended lower, down 0.27 at 416.01, while the Nasdaq composite of
over-the-counter stocks gave up 8.32 at 591.81. Turnover on the NYSE was
235m shares, and declines outnumbered rises by 899 to 817.
Although the day's main economic data - an unexpectedly large 18,000 fall in
the number of people claiming state unemployment insurance in the first week
of April - was positive, the news provided little inspiration for the
market, which had begun to look overbought after a 172-point advance during
the week.
The late surge in blue chip prices was due entirely to an imbalance of buy
orders linked to 'triple-witching hour', the monthly expirations of
derivatives contracts which were brought forward because of the Easter
holidays. When the orders were completed at the close, about 10 points were
added to the Dow.
General Motors featured with a gain of Dollars 2 1/4 to Dollars 42 1/4 in
turnover of 4m shares on reports that the giant car manufacturer might post
a modest profit for the first quarter. GM lifted the other car stocks, with
Ford adding Dollars 1 1/8 at Dollars 42 and Chrysler firming Dollars  1/4 to
Dollars 18 3/4 , both in heavy trading.
Once again the big, cyclical stocks enjoyed some of the biggest gains. Alcoa
rose Dollars 2 1/8 to Dollars 76 5/8 , United Technologies jumped Dollars 2
1/8 to Dollars 56, General Electric added Dollars 1 at Dollars 79 and
Allied-Signal rose Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 57 1/8 .
On the over-the-counter market, Centocor again took a beating, losing
Dollars 2 1/2 at Dollars 16 in turnover of 9m shares as investors continued
to react negatively to the news that the Food and Drug Administration would
not approve the company's Centoxin drug for the treatment of septic shock.
Centocor's problems spread to other bio-tech stocks. Somatogen ended down
Dollars 2 1/4 at Dollars 21 1/4 , Biogen slipped Dollars 2 1/4 to Dollars 21
1/2 , Immunex fell Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 25 1/2 and Amgen finished down
Dollars 2 3/8 at Dollars 57.
The big computer technology stocks also gave up ground, with Microsoft,
Wednesday's best performer, falling Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 127 5/8 , Intel
dropping Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 52 1/4 and Apple closing Dollars 1 1/2
lower at Dollars 59.
Canada
TORONTO stocks ended mixed on Thursday as trading slowed before the
three-day weekend. The TSE-300 composite index rose 3.8 to 3,415.1.
Declines led advances by 270 to 260 on volume of 20.2m shares valued at
CDollars 249m.

FT  18 APR 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Arbitrage-unwinding
depresses Nikkei
</HEADLINE>

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PROFIT-TAKING and arbitrage-unwinding caused the Nikkei average to fall for
the first time in four days, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The 225-issue average, which rose 11.75 on Thursday to 17,959.76, closed
down 379.07 at 17,580.69 yesterday, a fall of 1.5 per cent on the week. The
index traded between 18,192.89 and 17,769.27 on Thursday. Yesterday, the
Nikkei opened at the day's high of 17,916.90 and fell to the day's low of
17,490.06 in the afternoon.
Volume declined to 300m shares from 380m on Thursday when overseas investors
placed orders before Easter.
The rise on Thursday was supported by 794 gainers, while 231 issues fell and
97 were unchanged. However, declines led advances yesterday by 690 to 289,
with 155 issues unchanged. The Topix index fell 15.96 to 1,321.41 after
Thursday's advance of 15.38 to 1,337.37.
Large-lot index-linked sell orders by a leading Japanese broker depressed
the market. Traders said that while investors were willing to buy stocks at
lower levels, most refrained from buying around 18,000. 'A lot of domestic
institutions see the near-term resistance level at 18,500,' said Mr Masami
Okuma at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew.
High-technology issues, which were firm on Thursday on buying by pension
funds and foreigners, fell back. Toshiba fell Y9 to Y630 and Hitachi
retreated Y8 to Y832. Machinery stocks, which advanced on Thursday on a
month-on-month rise in March machinery orders, also lost ground. Amada fell
Y20 to Y1,170.
Speculative issues fell. Meiji Milk Products fell Y43 to Y736 and Okamoto
Industries lost Y20 to Y1,150. But Mitsubishi Gas Chemical rose Y20 to Y460
as buying interest was sparked by the development of a new anti-diabetic
drug. Meiji Milk Products rose Y16 to Y744.
Financials, which had rebounded on bargain-hunting and short-covering after
sharp falls last week, declined. Industrial Bank of Japan fell Y70 to Y1,800
and Fuji Bank fell Y20 to Y1,430.
In Osaka, the OSE average fell 304.63 to 19,860.39 in volume of 15.5m
shares. Investors were cautious after Thursday's rise of 303.28 to
20,165.02, in volume of 21.9m shares.
Roundup
Some Pacific Rim markets were open yesterday. On Thursday, the region was
mostly firmer, but in Bombay, brokers boycotted trading to protest against a
rise in registration fees.
SEOUL saw early buying peter out. The composite index rose 0.39 to 587.72,
up 3.2 per cent on the week, in turnover of Won336.3bn after Won314.6bn. On
Thursday, the index rose 9.22 to 587.33 on rumours that the government might
provide more loans to investment trusts.
TAIWAN gave up some of Thursday's gains on political worries. The weighted
index fell 35.30 to 4,503.22, down 1.3 per cent on the week, after rising
98.86 to 4,538.52 on Thursday. Turnover fell to TDollars 14.3bn from
TDollars 18.68bn.
BANGKOK was lifted by Bangkok Land which recovered Bt11 to Bt179 after
losing Bt17 in the previous two days. The SET index ended 12.76 higher at
822.88 on turnover of Bt6.03bn. On Thursday, the SET index fell 1.69 to
810.12.
KUALA LUMPUR ran into profit-taking after Thursday's climb. The composite
index eased 0.08 to 575.75, up 0.8 per cent on the week, after rising 7.64
to 575.83 on Thursday.
HONG KONG's Hang Seng index gained 96.58 or 1.94 per cent to 5,082.69 on
Thursday, up 0.2 per cent on the week. Turnover rose to HKDollars 3.17bn
from HKDollars 2.37bn.
Hang Seng Bank rose HKDollars 3.25 to HKDollars 42.25 after disclosure of
its inner reserves revealed positive earnings prospects.
SINGAPORE's Straits Times Industrial index put on 16.29 or 1.2 per cent to
1,410.61 on Thursday, up 2.2 per cent on the week. Volume rose to 43.46m
shares from 31.7m.
NEW ZEALAND's NZSE-40 index rose 13.35 to 1,410.69, up 0.4 per cent on the
week.

FT  18 APR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture (Week in the Market):  Gold
slides to fresh 6-year low
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD MOONEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOLD price slipped to a fresh six-year low of Dollars 336.80 a troy
ounce at Thursday morning's London bullion morning fixing, catching up with
a heavy overnight sell-off in New York. But the New York opening found the
gold market cautiously firmer, as holders of short positions covered ahead
of the long holiday weekend, and by the close the London price had edged up
to Dollars 336.85 an ounce, down Dollars 4.55 since the end of last week.
The gold market had begun the week in a mildly bullish mood as buying was
encouraged by news of the Russian cabinet's resignation offer. But the rise
quickly ran into US selling, which undermined support in the Dollars
342-an-ounce area, and the London price ended the day 40 cents down. Dealers
thought at that time that the market was likely to hold above Dollars 338 an
ounce ahead of the Easter break. But on Tuesday it drooped under the weight
of fresh wave of profit-taking after US retail sales figures proved to be no
better than expected. And with concern for the stability of the Yeltsin
regime continuing to ease, Wednesday saw the breach of the Dollars
338-an-ounce level.
Dealers were not too downhearted, however, about the post-holiday prospects
for the gold market. Most thought it was close to bottoming out - some said
at Dollars 334 and others at Dollars 330 an ounce. That might be followed by
a short-covering rally, they said, helped by Far East buying and a pick-up
in demand from the jewellery business.
Platinum and silver prices were also under pressure this week, the former -
which ended Dollars 5 down at Dollars 344.50 an ounce - from further bouts
of Japanese selling. The London cash silver price ended poised precariously
at the psychologically significant Dollars 4-an-ounce level, down 15 cents
on balance. Traders thought a breach of that level could quickly signal a
further 10-cent loss for silver and a move into an area where speculative
interest might evaporate.
Most London Metal Exchange base metals contracts gained ground on Thursday,
but only nickel, cash zinc and copper finished with net gains on the week.
In the copper market the three months position closed at Pounds 1,291.50 a
tonne, up Pounds 11 on the week. Earlier it had dipped to Pounds 1,270 a
tonne before bouncing on news of a sub-level closure because of rock falls
at Chile's giant El Teniente mine, although Codelco, the state company that
runs the mine, said overall output would not be affected.
The worries about the stability of the Russian administration also lifted
aluminium prices briefly. But after reaching a 9-month high of Dollars
1,342.50 a tonne on Tuesday the cash price declined to Dollars 1,329 a tonne
at Thursday's close, down Dollars 9.50 on the shortened week.
Thursday's zinc price recovery saw the cash position gain Dollars 13 at
Dollars 1,306 a tonne, up Dollars 2 on balance. But the market was still
being distorted by the apparent supply tightness that prompted the exchange
to warn traders last week that it was closely monitoring the situation. This
week the three months price declined by Dollars 9 to Dollars 1,278.50 a
tonne, so the cash premium, or 'backwardation' widened by another Dollars 11
to Dollars 27.50 a tonne.
At the London Futures and Options Exchange coffee prices were down heavily
from the outset on disappointment at the extremely modest progress made at
last week's International Coffee Organisation talks on negotiations for a
new price supporting coffee pact. After falling by Dollars 36 a tonne in the
July position on Monday the market was steadier, but 'under siege', traders
said, on Tuesday and Wednesday. The defences crumbled in New York on
Wednesday night and by Thursday's close London's July price had lost another
Dollars 19 at Dollars 801 a tonne, down Dollars 63 on the week.
In the cocoa market too, it was activity in New York that sparked a heavy
fall on Thursday. London's July futures price fell Pounds 19 yesterday to
Pounds 619 a tonne, down Pounds 15 on the week. Traders attributed the US
selling to liquidation by long holders as the near May position approached
the start of its expiry period. Earlier London prices had been steadied by
an unexpectedly big 21.1 per cent rise in UK first quarter bean grindings. A
21.2 per cent rise was reported yesterday for the Dutch grind, but analysts
thought the figure was inflated by under-reporting in the corresponding
period last year.
Talks on a new international cocoa agreement with economic clauses begin in
Geneva after the holiday, but serious negotiations still seem some way off
and traders were not pinning any great hopes on bullish developments. 'We
should clear the ground for serious negotiations on the withholding scheme,'
the German delegate to the International Cocoa Organisation said yesterday.

FT  18 APR 92 / London Stock Exchange: Market fails to conquer new peak
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LONDON stock market's phenomenal run finally lost its energy on Thursday
as tired traders looked towards the Easter break rather than back at the
Conservatives' general election win.
Early hopes that the FT-SE Index of the 100 biggest stocks would breach its
all-time high faded as the day wore on. International investors, who have
been pouring money into London for the past week, took a back seat and Wall
Street came off its record high. That lack of support and a more cautious
view from the futures markets ensured that the Footsie closed 1.6 off at
2,638.6.
Turnover remained significant, but the final figure of 897.4m shares looked
slightly less impressive once the impact of a placing of 120m shares in
Midland Bank was successfully carried out.
Commentators are now expecting the market to pause for breath and possibly
drift back.
Optimism for a record-breaking burst seemed well founded when the day began.
On Wednesday night, the FT-SE future contract for June delivery closed 25
points above its estimated fair value, the premium that takes into account
dividends and carrying costs. Then, on Wall Street, the Dow Jones moved up
more than 47 points to close at a new high.
On Thursday, London marketmakers adjusted their prices accordingly and the
Footsie opened 27.5 points higher. It moved up a further 5 points within the
first few minutes of trading. Then, as with the Labour party's hopes on
April 9, although signs were encouraging the support was lacking.
The Footsie dribbled off throughout the day, trading a few points up on the
previous day's close in the morning and moving below it after Wall Street
began to drift.
Turnover was the highest it had been all week, suggesting that customer
retail business could have been above Wednesday's Pounds 1.56bn. However,
investors were far more selective than previously and some were beginning to
take profits on certain stocks.
The market received further pressure from the performance of gilts which
fell heavily and short sterling, which was also off a few points.
It seemed that a rise of some 280 points within six trading days was too
much too cope with and analysts said that, while the market has obviously
entered a new era following the general election, it could slip back another
80 points before regaining its strength.
Retail business in equities was comfortably above Pounds 1bn all week as
money poured into London from overseas investors.

FT  18 APR 92 / London Stock Exchange: KIO sells stake in Midland
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO, COLIN MILLHAM and CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE KUWAIT Investment Office (KIO) successfully unloaded the bulk of its
10.5 per cent stake in Midland Bank on Thursday, making 355p per share.
Marketmakers said securities house Hoare Govett had been trying to place the
60m shares at 362p since Tuesday, after Hongkong and Shanghai Bank launched
its agreed bid for Midland, but eventually placed them with a wide range of
institutions at 356p. It is believed that the majority of the deals had been
pre-booked by Wednesday night. It is also believed that because of the risk
involved in placing such a large amount of stock the shares were not taken
on as part of a 'bought deal' where prices are pre-arranged. Dealers said
they were put through the market on a 'best offer' basis with Hoare
guaranteeing to get the best possible price.
Midland shares eased 2 to 362p, compared with the HSBC offer of around 385p
per share. Analyst said that although the market was not too enthusiastic
about the bid it could see no obvious alternative apart from Midland
remaining independent.
Lloyds Bank slipped 9 to 393p, suggesting it may continue to hanker after
Midland, as analysts tended to play down press speculation that Lloyds could
be looking at another bid for Standard Chartered. The price of Standard -
down 5 to 468p - did not point towards a bid, but Abbey National, also
mentioned as a possible Lloyds target rose 5 to 311p.
Reuters development
Information group Reuters rose after it announced that the second phase of
its Dealing 2000 share dealing system would start on April 29. As part of
the development, traders from around 20 banks in London and New York are
expected to be allowed to trade leading currency contracts - with Reuters
reportedly taking a Dollars 25-a-trade commission.
Dealing 2000-2 is also said to be weighing in around a year ahead of its
nearest rivals - by which time it plans to expand, first to Europe and then
to the Far East.
However, while most analysts agree that the development will help the stock
outperform in the long-term, some are more cautious short-term. Ms Lisa
Gordon at County NatWest said: 'Reuters was seen as a good hedge in the
volatile period before the election and was run up a little on that. At this
price, while we like the stock, we are on a short-term hold.' The shares
added 28 to 1160p.
Glaxo suffers
US switching from defensive stocks into shares which are expected to benefit
from a cyclical recovery hit Glaxo, whose shares are 27 per cent owned by US
investors in the form of American Depositary Receipts.
Dealers said the switching started on Wednesday with sellers concentrating
on Merck, the US drugs giant. Glaxo, whose performance in the US tends to
mirror Merck's, also weakened. In London, on Thursday, the shares slipped 24
to 788p with a brisk 4m traded.
Tate &amp; Lyle gained 16 to 421p as the shares caught up after underperforming
the market by about 12 per cent over the last three months. Mr Carl Short,
food manufacturing analyst at Nomura, said the company is likely to show a
downturn in earnings for the year ending in September, but is expected to
bounce back.
A sober trading assessment for BP by chairman Robert Horton revealed little
new for analysts to chew over at the group's agm on Thursday. Mr John
Toalster at Strauss Turnbull said that he believed the 'realistic' summation
pointed to the group preparing the ground for a dividend cut later this
year. BP shares rose 2 to 259p.
While residents may be in short supply, investors were visiting the hotel
sector in great numbers following Forte's results on Wednesday. Some
analysts believe the stock to be overpriced, Mr Paul Slattery at Kleinworts
said: 'It will take the company at least two years to get back to the level
of earnings of last year. Investors should reduce their exposure.' But Forte
remains popular with institutions, with 8m shares traded and the price
unmoved at 254p.
Queens Moat Houses also attracted attention, the shares slipping 2 to 79p in
hefty volume of 4.9m.
Theme park operator Euro Disney's fall from grace continued, the shares
sliding 28 to 1335p as the site's lacklustre opening reflected badly.
Granada Group added 7 to 277p. The group has been seeing analysts prior to
moving into its closed period and has been making bullish noises.
While some UK institutions continued to bail out of Vodafone - Thursday's
15m share turnover followed the previous session's 22m - US investors were
happy to pick up the stock. The price was unchanged at 356p.
Drugs group Fisons rose 15 to 384p in good volume of 4.7m. One analyst said
that the rise was largely attributable to continued bid speculation and also
anticipation of a favourable visit to the group's Holmes Chapel facility
next week by the US Food and Drug Administration.
Profit taking in Rolls-Royce left the shares a penny easier at 168p, on
turnover of 8m shares. It was suggested that BZW were the day's main
sellers. Profit-taking in GKN was also responsible for reversing an earlier
rise in the shares which ended 10 down at 380p.
Overseas buying of British Steel left the shares 5 up at 75p. Bid talk was
again heard around Dowty Group, where the shares gained to 6 to 229p.
A maintained dividend, despite a fall in full-year profits, helped Hunting
rise 8 to 176p.
News of a Pounds 15m contract from the German Ministry of Defence helped
Howden Group firm 2 to 61p.
Bid Talk combined with a squeeze sent Glynwed International climbing another
10 to 273p. Bargain hunters helped Eurotunnel reverse recent falls to end 6
up at 376p.
Building materials group Redland continued to shine, basking in the
aftermath of its Steetley deal and benefiting from its international
exposure, the prognosis for the UK building industry still uncertain. The
shares added 10 to 548p in turnover of 3.3m. RMC also attracted attention,
the shares rising 15 to 645p.
Surprising strength in Tarmac after its poor results on Wednesday saw the
shares put on 7 to 146p in very heavy volume of 12m. Traders said that
renewed bid rumours were underpinning the turnover, although no new names
had entered the frame.
Discount food retailer Kwik Save continued to benefit from bid rumours
involving Hong Kong-based Dairy Farm, which holds 25 per cent of the equity,
rising 15 to 588p and gaining 32p on the week.
Guinness fell 4 1/2 to 571 1/2 p on concern about lower cognac sales in the
Far East and an approaching conversion of debenture and loan stock into
ordinary shares.
Rumours that Hanson is about to sell its 2.8 per cent stake in ICI, thus
strengthening its war chest for its long-awaited bid, was not taken
seriously in the market. ICI's fall of 2 to 1345p was attributed more to
general weakness in the market. Hanson eased a halfpenny to 235p.

FT  18 APR 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE STRONG demand in the derivatives market of the recent sessions ran out
of steam on Thursday after dealers chose to take profits, writes Joel
kibazo.
In stock index futures, trading in the June contract on the FT-SE opened at
2,715. This proved to be the high point of the session as a spate of selling
orders soon caused a retreat in June. Several of the largest orders during
the session were seen to have come from some of the leading institutions
eager to cash in on the recent advances.
A weak Wall Street only served to cause further selling and June eventually
closed at 2,675, a premium of 37 and around 15 points above its estimated
fair value premium to cash of about 22. Turnover reached 7,167.
Business in the traded options market also returned to lower levels. Total
turnover at 37,388 contracts was down on Wednesday's figure of 49,737 lots
though the volume in the FT-SE option, at 10,856 lots, was only a shade
lighter than the previous session.
BTR was the busiest stock option. It traded 2,451 contracts. It was followed
by Asda in which 2,147 lots were dealt. The Euro FT-SE option was also busy
at 2,108 contracts, while Tesco traded 1896 lots.

FT  18 APR 92 / Money Markets: Long rates soften
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
RATES at the longer end of the UK money markets softened on Thursday, the
last day of trading before the Easter holiday.
One year money fell  1/16 of a point to 10 3/16 - 1/8 per cent. However, the
key three-month interbank rate remained unchanged at 10 3/8 per cent,
reflecting the market's view of no immediate change in base rates.
Dealers suggested that better-than-expected unemployment figures for March
had been offset by slightly worse than forecast average earnings growth.
This was interpreted to support the view that UK authorities believe
inflationary pressures are still evident, hindering prospects of a rate cut.
'Today is the first day in a couple of weeks that economic reality has set
into interest rate expectations,' said Mr Nick Parsons of CIBC.
The June short sterling contract eased from an opening of 89.87 to 89.80 by
the London close, and continued to decline in after-hours trading. The
London closing rate implied an interest rate of 10.2 per cent, compared with
10.12 per cent on Wednesday's close.
As expected, money market players queued up to offer paper ahead of the long
weekend, pushing overnight rates as low as 8 per cent.
'Everyone got their money fairly cheaply over the weekend,' said one trader.
The Bank of England, having forecast a Pounds 1.75bn shortage on Thursday
morning, was able to wipe out the majority of the shortfall in the early
round. Some Pounds 1.585bn was injected in early operations, with a Pounds
229m purchase of band one bank bills at 10 3/8 per cent, and a Pounds
1.356bn repurchase agreement falling due on May 7 at 10 7/16 per cent.
The noon round saw a further Pounds 199m purchase of band one bank bills at
10 3/8 per cent.
The main factors putting pressure on liquidity were treasury bills and
maturing assistance of Pounds 1.497bn and an Pounds 810m rise in note
circulation. These factors were offset by exchequer transactions, which
brought in Pounds 400m, and bankers' balances Pounds 150m above target.
In Germany, call rates finished unchanged at 9.60/65 per cent in a quiet
market.
In the US, the Federal Reserve added liquidity through a Dollars 2bn
repurchase agreement. Funds traded at about 3 3/4 per cent, the presumed Fed
target.

FT  18 APR 92 / International Company News: ING may take 15% stake in BBL
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RONALD VAN DE KROL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   AMSTERDAM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
INTERNATIONALE Nederlanden (ING), the Dutch banking and insurance group, is
holding talks on acquiring all or part of Groupe Bruxelles Lambert's (GBL)
stake in Banque Bruxelles Lambert (BBL), Belgium's second-biggest bank, as
part of a strategy of creating a second 'home' market south of the Dutch
border.
If it succeeds in buying GBL's direct stake of nearly 15 per cent, ING -
which already owns roughly 9 per cent of the Belgian bank - will become
BBL's single largest shareholder.
Besides its direct stake in BBL, GBL also has close relations with two other
main shareholders, Royale Belge and its French parent Union des Assurances
de Paris (UAP), which together hold more than 10 per cent of the Belgian
bank's shares.
Mr Willem Scherpenhuijsen Rom, ING's vice-chairman, said he expected the
negotiations with GBL to take some time. He added that ING had no plans to
launch a public bid for the rest of BBL's shares, citing 'psychological'
obstacles in Belgium to an outright Dutch takeover.
ING, which was formed last year through the merger of Nationale-Nederlanden
and NMB Postbank, said it would seek to form an exclusive banking
partnership with BBL.
After an extensive courtship by several of its biggest insurance industry
shareholders, BBL told ING, Royale Belge and Winterthur of Switzerland last
month that they would all be entitled to work with it in expanding in the
field of insurance. Earlier, BBL had been presented with two rival insurance
proposals, one from ING and the other from Royal Belge and Winterthur.
ING is having to tread carefully in its attempt to become BBL's most
powerful shareholder, partly because of the delicate relations between the
Flemish and French-speaking parts of Belgium's financial community.
BBL's institutional shareholders, which together own more than 50 per cent
of the bank's capital, have a long-standing pledge to notify each other if
they plan to buy or sell additional shares.
On Thursday, ING reported a 4.2 per cent increase in 1991 net profit to Fl
1.57bn (Dollars 840m).
The modest profit rise was due partly to reduced losses at ING's Orion
subsidiary in London, and to growth in foreign lending, leasing and trading
in Third World debt. For 1992, ING is forecasting that net profit will at
least match 1991 results.

FT  18 APR 92 / International Company News: Peugeot cuts dividend as profits
tumble
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PSA PEUGEOT Citroen, the French car company, fell prey to the downturn in
demand that depressed the international motor industry last year and saw its
net profits fall by 40 per cent from FFr9.26bn in 1990 to FFr5.53bn (Dollars
983m) in 1991.
Mr Jacques Calvet, chairman, said he expected an improvement in market
conditions this year and sales growth of 7 per cent to 8 per cent. However,
the board has decided to cut the dividend
from FFr19.5 to FFr13 a share.
The group, hit last year by sluggish sales and rising research costs, is the
latest in a series of international car companies to have reported depressed
results for 1991.
The French group maintained that although profits had fallen in 1991, its
net margins - at 3.5 per cent - were still the highest of all the major
motor groups, ahead of Toyota with 2.9 per cent and BMW with 2.6 per cent.
The group's sales were virtually static last year at FFr160.17bn, compared
with FFr159.98bn in 1990. But costs of launching two new cars - the Citroen
ZX and Peugeot 106 - during the year, combined with higher research costs,
lowered operating profits to FFr10.1bn from FFr15.7bn. The overall level of
investment rose by 2.5 per cent to FFr15.52bn.
Pre-tax profits fell by 39.8 per cent from FFr14.08bn to FFr8.49bn while the
group's net debt rose from FFr8.27bn to FFr9.39bn by the year-end. Earnings
per share slipped from FFr185 to FFr111 in 1991.
The group took steps to cut costs and to reduce stocks last year. Mr Calvet
said it had reduced car stocks by 10,000 units by bringing 'production
better into line with sales'. The group produced 2.05m cars in Europe last
year, against 2.22m in 1990, and sold 2.06m cars, compared with 2.19m.
The group, he said, planned to cut costs further this year.
Mr Calvet expected an improvement in sales this year, although first-quarter
business had been comparatively quiet. He added that Peugeot Citroen was
keen to increase collaborative ventures with other motor manufacturers.

FT  18 APR 92 / International Company News: Cheung Kong to buy EIE Int'l arm
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   HONG KONG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EIE International, the cash-strapped Japanese property group, is to sell its
Hong Kong-listed property arm to Cheung Kong, the property development
company owned by Mr Li Ka-shing, the colony's richest man.
EIE Development had long been the subject of takeover rumours, on the
assumption that its Japanese parent would want to realise cash from this
non-core asset. EIE Development's main asset is 55 per cent ownership of the
twin-towered Bond Centre.
The offer from Cheung Kong was pitched at HKDollars 4 per share, compared
with its previous closing price of HKDollars 3.025. The offer values the
company at HKDollars 1.7bn (USDollars 220m), whereas the company's most
recent valuation gave it a net asset value of HKDollars 2.25bn.
Cheung Kong fully exploited last year's property boom in Hong Kong, through
residential development sales which generated net profit of HKDollars 4.89bn
last year. It has gone out on a stock market spending spree to park this
cash flow, investing close to HKDollars 3bn in 12 local companies over the
past 16 months.
However, its latest purchase can be seen more as a property transaction than
a stock market investment. Unlike its other purchases, Cheung Kong will take
control of the property company and is likely to privatise it.
Analysts believe it is a sign of optimism over the office property market,
which has laboured under a glut of supply in the past two years.
The deal also emphasises the strength of Cheung Kong and its position of
being able to exploit casualties from lesser-performing property markets.

FT  18 APR 92 / International Company News: French bank forecloses on
collateralised MGM shares
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CREDIT Lyonnais took steps to sever the last connection between MGM, the
Hollywood film studio, and Mr Giancarlo Parretti, the controversial Italian
financier, on Thursday when the French bank announced it would foreclose on
the 98.5 per cent of MGM's stock it holds as collateral for loans made to
MGM and its parent Pathe Communications.
The financially crippled studio is currently in default on Dollars 600m of
loans from Credit Lyonnais, which in 1990 provided the bulk of the financing
for Mr Parretti's Dollars 1.3bn acquisition of MGM from Mr Kirk Kerkorian,
the hotel owner.
To foreclose on the collateralised shares, Credit Lyonnais first has to put
them up for sale. The stock will be auctioned in Delaware on May 7, and
Credit Lyonnais said that at least Dollars 400m of the indebtedness owed it
by MGM-Pathe will be bid for in the purchase of the stock. It is unlikely
that any bidders will come forward.
Credit Lyonnais won control over the management of the studio three months
ago when a Delaware court settled a dispute over the ownership of MGM by
ruling in favour of the French bank. The decision was a defeat for Mr
Parretti, who had been fighting for control of MGM through a series of
lawsuits against Credit Lyonnais. Mr Parretti is currently appealing against
a four-year prison sentence and fraud conviction in Italy.
By severing all links between MGM and Mr Parretti, Credit Lyonnais hopes to
strengthen the position of the studio's current management, which is working
on a long-term business plan for MGM's survival.
Mr Alan Ladd and Mr Dennis Stanfill, the co-chairmen of MGM, said on
Thursday night that the auction would not affect the ongoing business and
operations of the studio. They said: 'The company is finalising a
comprehensive business plan in co-operation with the bank and expects to
make continuing progress in this process as well as in its negotiations for
a new credit line to reinforce MGM's prospects for the future.'
The dire state of MGM's finances, however, was illustrated earlier this week
when the company's auditor, KPMG Peat Marwick, qualified its report of MGM's
1991 full-year loss of Dollars 347.7m by questioning whether the company
would be able to continue as 'a going concern'.

FT  18 APR 92 / International Company News: Credit Agricole edges up 5%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CREDIT Agricole, one of France's biggest banks, experienced its second
successive year of sluggish profits growth and steep provisions in 1991 when
net profits rose by just 5 per cent from FFr4.7bn to FFr4.93bn (Dollars
876m).
Despite the relatively sluggish increase in profits, Credit Agricole, which
is a co-operative farmers' bank, made the highest profits of all the French
retail banks last year by beating the 'three old ladies' - Banque Nationale
de Paris, Credit Lyonnais and Societe Generale.
Mr Yves Barsalou, president, said that 'continuity and stability' were the
linchpins of Credit Agricole's development and had helped it cope with the
competitive conditions of the French banking market.
Credit Agricole's net banking income rose by 11.4 per cent to FFr57.5bn
during the year.
It restricted the rise in general costs to 4.5 per cent at FFr32.6bn,
thereby boosting gross profits by 22.1 per cent to FFr24.9bn.
However, Credit Agricole, like other big French banks, notably Credit
Lyonnais and the Paribas investment banking group, was forced to raise
provisions last year by 17 per cent to FFr13.9bn. This followed another
sharp increase - of 15 per cent to FFr11.9bn - in 1990.
Mr Barsalou said that Credit Agricole planned to continue its strategy of
controlling costs and rationalising its overheads by merging regional
branches in 1992. It would also continue its expansion abroad after recent
investments in Italy and Portugal.

FT  18 APR 92 / International Company News: Hefty pre-merger loss at SecPac
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN FRIEDMAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FIRST-quarter earnings from the soon-to-be-merged Bank of America and
Security Pacific continue to underscore Bank of America's profitability and
the heavy losses at SecPac, the weaker of the two banks.
Bank of America and SecPac agreed to merge last summer in a Dollars 4.5bn
transaction, the biggest in US banking history. The deteriorating balance
sheet at SecPac has persuaded most observers to view the merger as
effectively a rescue.
In the last set of separate results from the banks before completion of
their merger, the San Francisco-based Bank of America reported 7 per cent
higher net profits of Dollars 303m in the first quarter of 1992.
By contrast, SecPac - hit by nearly trebled loan loss provisions of Dollars
786.8n - unveiled a hefty Dollars 496.3m first-quarter loss, which compares
with net earnings of Dollars 96.5m in the first quarter of 1991.
Mr Richard Rosenberg, chairman of Bank of America, attributed his bank's
strong first quarter earnings to 'prudent management of the credit portfolio
and success in our expense control efforts'.
He noted that despite the sluggish US economy, the bank's net loan losses
and non-performing assets actually declined year-on-year.
Its net loan losses were Dollars 219m in the first quarter of 1992, less
than half the Dollars 447m suffered in the same period of 1991. At March 31,
1992, the bank's non-performing assets totalled Dollars 2.95bn, down from
Dollars 3.1bn at last December 31.
SecPac, by contrast, said its poor first-quarter results reflected 'the
continued impact of prolonged adverse economic conditions' in several key
markets. Non-performing loans and leases totalled Dollars 3.5bn at March 31,
1992, compared with Dollars 2.75bn last December 31.
Continental Bank of Chicago, helped by lower loan loss provisions, said
first-quarter net income jumped to Dollars 57m, from Dollars 28m in the
first three months of last year.
Mr Tom Theobald, chairman, said the bank was continuing to see positive
results from its restructuring.

MICROSOFT, the leading personal computer software publisher, reported a 44
per cent rise in earnings for its third fiscal quarter, buoyed by continuing
strong sales of its Windows operating system program, writes Louise Kehoe in
San Francisco.
Net income for the quarter, ended March 31, was Dollars 179m, or 90 cents
per share, up from Dollars 124m, or 65 cents, in the third quarter of fiscal
1991. Revenues were Dollars 681m, an increase of almost 40 per cent over
Dollars 487m in the same period a year ago.
The third-quarter results reflected record revenues from sales to personal
computer manufacturers and continued strong retail sales, the company said.
'More than 200 OEMs (original equipment manufacturers) around the world have
licensed the Microsoft Windows operating system,' said Mr Frank Gaudette,
executive vice-president and chief financial officer.
The third-quarter results capped a week in which Microsoft won important
rulings in its copyright infringement dispute with Apple Computer, lifting
the cloud of litigation that has hung over Microsoft's Windows program.

BRITISH Gas has paid Dollars 52m for a one-third stake in Natural Gas
Clearinghouse, the largest independent gas marketing company in the US.
LG&amp;E, another resources company, has also acquired a one-third share in the
marketing company. The remaining one-third will continue to be held by NGC's
management.
The move marks British Gas' first venture into the US gas industry where
prices are currently at all-time lows.
'It will give us a first-hand insight into gas trading in the US and allow
us to see how it could fit into our business in future,' an official said.
British Gas is also believed to be interested in purchasing a 41 per cent
stake in Home Oil, the Canadian oil producer, which is being sold by the
Reichmann Brothers.
This would complement the company's other gas interests in Canada.
Natural Gas Clearinghouse is based in Houston and operates eight gas plants
and 1,400 miles of gas pipelines.
