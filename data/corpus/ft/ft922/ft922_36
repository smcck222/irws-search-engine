FT  18 APR 92 / UK Company News: Premier Consolidated at Pounds 8.9m for
nine months
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PREMIER Consolidated Oil-fields reported net profits of Pounds 8.9m for the
nine months to December 31, the company's new reporting date, against Pounds
11.2m for the previous year. The figure for the comparable period was Pounds
8.4m.
Nine-month turnover rose from Pounds 31.4m to Pounds 32m. Earnings per share
increased slightly to 1.72p (1.61p).
Premier has adjusted its accounting policies to write off abortive
exploration efforts in the US and Papua New Guinea which reduced last year's
amortisation charge by Pounds 1.3m.
During the period production increased from 9,290 barrels of oil a day to
11,000 b/d.
Production has since risen to 15,000 b/d with the start-up of the Angus
field in the North Sea.
Mr Roland Shaw, chairman, said the company was looking at some promising
ventures in the North Sea as well as high-risk exploration in Burma and
Cambodia.
Mr Shaw will visit Daghestan in the Commonwealth of Independent States on
Tuesday to negotiate an oil production-sharing contract.
The company said it had decided not to pay a dividend while oil shares and
prices remain so low nor would it make its usual 1-for-10 scrip.
Mr Shaw said that the fall in its market price had bottomed and would slowly
recover. The shares closed down 2p at 20p on Thursday.

FT  18 APR 92 / UK Company News: Capital restructuring and warning from
Surrey Group
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SURREY Group, the USM-quoted company with interests in betting and gambling,
issued its second consecutive annual profits warning and announced plans for
a capital restructuring which would help pay debts owed to a director.
The group, which came to the market in 1989 and launched a Pounds 2.5m
rights issue to pay debt less than a year later, warned that results for the
year to March 31 might be below expectations due to 'extremely difficult
trading conditions'.
Surrey also said it planned to issue 16.3m new shares at 1p each. To comply
with company law, the existing 5p shares - which have been trading at about
3 1/4 p - will have to be split. Surrey proposes to create one ordinary
share of 1p, which will carry all voting and dividend rights, and a deferred
share of 4p which will, in effect, be worthless.
Some 12m of the new 16.3m shares - about 8.8 per cent of the company's
current share capital - would be offered to Mr R Fatah, a director, at 3p,
in lieu of repaying Pounds 360,000 of a Pounds 500,000 loan following the
purchase of 12 betting shops from Coral Racing in February.
Three other individuals would inject Pounds 129,000 by purchasing the
outstanding 4.3m shares - about 3.2 per cent of the current equity - at 3p.
The proposals will be put to shareholders at an extraordinary meeting on May
8.

Fitch RS, the provider of design services, returned to the black in the
second half of the 1991 year. However, it was not enough to overcome the
first half deficit leaving the overall pre-tax loss at Pounds 417,000,
against profits of Pounds 51,000.
Operating profits were ahead at Pounds 1.61m (Pounds 753,000) but there was

of redundancies and the company's unoccupied offices. Net interest charges
were Pounds 845,000 (Pounds 7,000 received).
Turnover fell to Pounds 18.1m (Pounds 22.6m). After a tax credit of Pounds

A sharply higher contribution from its overseas operations enabled Albert
Martin, the clothing manufacturer and distributor, to achieve a 16 per cent
improvement in profits to Pounds 2.38m pre-tax for 1991.
To fund current projects and strengthen the capital base, shareholders are

Overseas operations increased turnover by 20 per cent to Pounds 16.9m and

Quicks Group, the motor distributor, ended 1991 just in the black with
Pounds 58,000 at the end of 12 months which saw the closure of the
loss-making Trafford Vehicle Leasing and a board reshuffle following the
arrival of Mr Alec Murray as managing director.
The shares leapt 22p to 90p.
The pre-tax outcome compared with a loss of Pounds 896,000 in 1990, restated
following changes in the treatment of extraordinary and exceptional items.
After being cut to 1p at the midway stage, the final dividend is doubled to
2p, maintaining the total at 3p.
An extraordinary item of Pounds 825,000 (Pounds 294,000) represented closure
costs of Trafford, including bad debts. Losses per share were reduced to

FT  18 APR 92 / UK Company News: Friendly Hotels falls to Pounds 3.89m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GULF war and the continuing recession left Friendly Hotels with pre-tax
profits of Pounds 3.89m for the 12 months to December 29, down 35 per cent
on the comparable Pounds 6.01m.
Turnover fell from Pounds 31.2m to Pounds 28.7m.
The company said it was the first time that profits had not grown since the
present board took over in 1986.
Adverse effects of the recession could not be overcome and the company said
that it was therefore gratifying that reasonable profitability was
maintained in the second half with a pre-tax figure of Pounds 2.54m (Pounds
3.48m).
Earnings per share were 16.3p (34.9p) basic or 15.5p (25.3p) fully diluted.
An increased final dividend of 3.3p is proposed for a total of 5.5p (5p).
An extraordinary charge of Pounds 1.95m (Pounds 264,000) relating to the
decision to dispose of the fast service restaurants and the nursing and care
homes, left a loss for the year of Pounds 701,000 (Pounds 3.08m profit).

FT  18 APR 92 / UK Company News: Hunting almost halved to Pounds 21m as
defence side falls by a third
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HUNTING, the maker of the P233 runway denial bombs used to great effect in
the Gulf war, has reported profits sharply lower as its key defence business
fell by a third.
Group pre-tax profits in 1991 fell from Pounds 38.5m to Pounds 21.1m on
sales Pounds 21.6m lower at Pounds 749.7m.
Basic earnings per share fell from 23.8p to 10.2p, or from 23.5p to 12.7p
fully diluted, but the directors are recommending maintaining the final
dividend at 6p, giving an unchanged total of 10p.
The group spent Pounds 31m on its aviation and its oil and technology
divisions, continuing efforts to diversify away from defence businesses.
The group took a Pounds 6.2m exceptional charge relating to the closure of
its US car body filling business and the write-off of property.
Mr Ken Miller, chief executive, said it was unlikely there would be a
similar exceptional charge this year.
Gearing rose from 42 to 58 per cent as net borrowings increased by Pounds
16m to Pounds 69m. The company said gearing was unlikely to change this year
and capital expenditure would fall.
Profits before interest in the defence division fell from Pounds 15.7m to
Pounds 10.5m as the JP233 contract came to an end early in the year.
Mr Miller said the division continued to earn a good return on capital and
that the greater part of its decline in profits had taken now place.
Operating profits in the oil and technology area rose almost 7 per cent to
Pounds 11.3m despite problems with the bodyfiller business which has been
since sold. The UK specialised products, including those for the DIY market,
increased sales and profits.
Mr Miller expected a significant increase in profits from this area this
year.
COMMENT
Hunting has suffered along with other defence contractors, underperforming
the market quite sharply in the last six months. Furthermore, in the two
non-defence divisions it is now pushing, it has few niche positions and the
aviation and oil businesses are experiencing particularly tough times. While
growth is unlikely to be exciting, there are, however, reasons to suggest
Harding has been oversold. The dividend is well covered, last year's
exceptionals relating to the closure of a business and property write-offs
are unlikely to recur, and the group should start to benefit from the US
reorganisation. Pre-tax profits could easily be Pounds 29m in 1992, giving
earnings of 17.7p and a prospective gross yield of 7.8p, a 50 per cent
premium to the market.

FT  18 APR 92 / UK Company News: First challenge to SE ruling is brought
forward
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Stock Exchange succeeded on Thursday in speeding up the hearing of the
first judicial review brought against it, after Sir Andrew Hugh Smith, the
exchange's chairman, warned of the dangers of a delay.
In an affidavit to the High Court, Sir Andrew said that the delay in hearing
the review was causing uncertainty and could lead to further challenges to
the exchange's decisions.
'In a time when the effectiveness of City regulation is being questioned,
there is need for visible certainty that the Stock Exchange is exercising
its authority legitimately,' Sir Andrew said.
The judicial review has been sought by two shareholders of Titaghur, a jute
manufacturing company which was delisted after its chairman was arrested on
insider dealing charges three years ago.
The case would have taken another 18 months to be heard, prompting
Thursday's hearing at which the Stock Exchange urged an earlier date to be
set.
The exchange is the Competent Authority for listings in the UK, as required
by the European Community's 1979 Admission Directive.

FT  18 APR 92 / UK Company News: Heron bondholders warned over 'significant'
loss
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HERON International, Mr Gerald Ronson's property and finance company, warned
its bondholders they 'would suffer a significant loss' if their opposition
to the group's debt rescheduling pushed the group into liquidation, writes
Bronwen Maddox.
'In the event of a liquidation it is estimated that the group's liabilities
would exceed assets' the group said in a memorandum to bondholders, which
asked them not to 'take any hasty action'.
The memorandum also shows that in the year to March 31 1992 Heron suffered a
pre-tax loss of Pounds 217m after exceptional items of Pounds 93m. The
previous year there was a restated pre-tax loss of Pounds 59m, after
reclassifying extraordinary losses as exceptional.
Following the slump in US and European property values, Heron is seeking to
reschedule about Pounds 1bn of its Pounds 1.45bn debt, including Pounds 448m
in Eurobonds.
Quotation of the eleven outstanding bond issues was suspended three weeks
ago on European exchanges, and winning the support of the bondholders is now
one of the main hurdles for the proposals.
About Pounds 400m of the debt is not affected by the rescheduling, being
held directly by UK, European and some US subsidiaries, and in a liquidation
would be likely to be repaid in full, according to the memorandum. As a
result the Heron management believes bondholders would not be repaid in full
in a liquidation.
The group proposed the rescheduling when it recognised that net asset
writedowns of Pounds 115m at March 31, against Pounds 585m a year earlier,
would breach bank covenants.
The group's proposals are to split debt into A and B categories where the
first receives interest but the second has interest deferred.
It also plans a Pounds 1.4bn disposal programme stretched over seven years.

FT  18 APR 92 / UK Company News: Eagle Star Australian unit sold for Pounds
130m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EAGLE STAR, the insurance subsidiary of BAT Industries, has announced the
sale of its Australian Eagle Insurance subsidiary.
The sale, for about Pounds 130m, will boost a capital base battered by
recent losses on domestic mortgage indemnity business and other
recession-related losses.
Mr Michael Heath, executive director, said book profits of Pounds 75m from
the deal would lift the group's solvency margin (the yardstick which
measures net assets as a percentage of non-life premiums) by 7 percentage
points to 46 per cent.
Australian Eagle underwrote non-life premiums of about ADollars 150m (Pounds
65m) and about ADollars 180m in life premium income in 1991, contributing
profits of Pounds 5m when Eagle Star reported pre-tax losses of Pounds 394m.
QBE Insurance will acquire the non-life business, while Lend Lease
Corporation, which owns MLC Life, the country's third biggest life office,
will acquire the life business.
Mr Heath said that scale was an important ingredient of success in the
fragmented Australian market.
'We would have been prepared to make more investment in Australia if we had
been attempting to develop a global approach to non-life business,' said Mr
Heath.
Instead Eagle Star would concentrate on building its life and personal lines
business in the UK and rest of Europe, he added.
The sale marks a further restructuring in the competitive Australian market.
Last month Guardian Royal Exchange, another UK composite company, agreed to
merge its Australian operation with that of Zurich Insurance.
Australian Eagle's general insurance business is concentrated in Victoria.
It has a particularly strong presence in the agricultural risks market.

FT  18 APR 92 / UK Company News: Worcester holders angry over Pounds 72m
German offer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ANGRY SHAREHOLDERS of Worcester Group said that the central heating boiler
maker had accepted an offer which undervalued the company.
Robert Bosch, the German automotive components, telecommunications and
domestic appliance group, has offered 225p a share for the company, valuing
it at Pounds 71.8m.
The row is set to enliven the current debate about corporate governance.
Worcester shares rose 30p to 218p on Thursday.
Commitments to accept have been given by the company's management and their
families, holding 38.4 per cent of the shares, and some institutional
investors, with 13 per cent, giving a total of 51.4 per cent. Mr Michael
Davies, the only independent director of Worcester, is recommending it as
'fair and reasonable'.
Gartmore Investment Management and TSB Group are thought to be among the
accepting institutions. But others believe a higher price could have been
obtained.
Mr Jim Fisher, director of Scottish Amicable Investment Management
responsible for small and medium-sized companies, said 'we are not at all
pleased about this bid'.
He said a bid should be at 'a much, much higher price', and challenged
Worcester to 'test the price in the market'.
He was also angry that the group's directors would receive a different offer
from outside shareholders. Worcester directors will take a 32.3 per cent
stake in the new subsidiary of Bosch and will continue to run the business
within Bosch.
This stake will be bought out in 1996 at a performance-related price of up
to 393 1/2 p, and not less than 100p. Meanwhile, dividends will be paid on
the shares, though with a higher level of cover than in the past.
The Takeover Panel said the deal was not unfair to outside shareholders.
Advisers to both sides - JO Hambro Magan for Bosch and Smith New Court for
Worcester - had assured the Panel that the value of the management shares
was no more than the cash offer.
Mr Cecil Duckworth, chairman and chief executive of Worcester, and a holder
of 9m shares, said the price gave an historic multiple of 21.6. The
directors will be bought out at 20.4 times average earnings for 1993, 1994
and 1995.
On forecasts for earnings from Smith New Court, the 225p offer gives a p/e
of 17.6 for 1992 and 13.4 for 1993.
Mr Clemens Boersig, associate member of the Bosch board, said the merger
would bring substantial synergies.

FT  18 APR 92 / Letter: Markets and community
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr JEREMY WILLINGS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Mr Bryn Jones (Letters, April 15) states that, 'market and community
activities are inherently contradictory', and seems to imply that they are
somehow divorced from each other in their respective raisons d'etre, that
they exist in spite of rather than because of each other.
If, as he suggests, people in a community act on the basis of moral values,
then crime presumably would cease to exist. Markets represent an activity of
people in a community and exist to serve the community - if they did not,
they would have ceased to exist long ago.
Moreover, they reflect the moral values of the community. Laws prohibit
monopolies and cartels, for example, in order to protect the community
against unjust exploitation by a few. On the other hand, wealth generated by
market processes is taxed and deployed by the government for the benefit of
the community, as in its support of the National Health Service.
But, just as the individual in John Major's vision should be free to aspire
to the highest possible degree of personal fulfilment, so markets should be
permitted to be sufficiently free to evolve and adapt to changing
circumstances without undue government interference, otherwise they will
cease to serve the community efficiently.
There is no contradiction in Majorite Conservatism resting 'on a combination
of markets and community'. The Labour party seems unable to grasp this
reality and has paid the price in successive elections. Jeremy Willings,

Sir, Your supplement on management education (April 10) continues to
perpetuate some myths about the role of an MBA which are commonly expressed
in media coverage of business education. MBAs, so the story goes, are past
their sell-by date. There are too many of them and only a few of the
existing programmes are likely to flourish.
This error is partly based upon a perception of the MBA programme as a
finishing school for the super-privileged; an initiation rite for the future
captains of global industry - but only for the multilingual and rich elite.
Fortunately, the truth is quite different. The MBA is essentially a 'career
adjuster' for a wide range of those who want to diversify, up-grade or shift
direction. As such, far from having peaked in importance, the MBA will
become an increasingly essential part of a dynamic and flexible economy.
Who is going to convert the forces officer into a personnel manager, the
banker into a consultant, the engineer into a finance director, the equity
trader into a fund manager? MBA courses have done, and continue to do this
and more.
The structure of MBA courses, accordingly, has to offer a range of basic
skills which all modern business requires, plus the facility for advanced
training in specialist areas which create immediate employability. The
generalist may be admired, but is he really what the market needs? Which
firm would invest in a machine that could do a little bit of everything?
The fact that companies are increasingly buying in purpose-built training
courses in no way diminishes the value of an MBA. On the contrary, in a
rapidly changing world the value of training of all kinds is rising, not
falling. Losers will be those unprepared for change. MBAs are the least
likely to fall into this class.
Management journalists might even benefit from an MBA] They would, at least,
not write about them in such condescending tones.

FT  18 APR 92 / Letter: Engineers' low status key factor behind UK
industry's problems
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr J LEDGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your article on the state of UK engineering ('Machines in need of
maintenance', April 14) omits one of the major reasons for the problem: the
status, and indeed identity, of British engineers.
Whereas our colleagues in the US, Japan and the rest of Europe have the
professional standing and wages at least equal to doctors and accountants,
most British people associate the word 'engineer' with someone who works in
a garage. Engineering salaries, meanwhile, are far lower than in other
countries or in other professions in the UK. It is thus no surprise that so
many British engineering graduates go into the financial sector, a move that
would be unthinkable here in France. Applications for engineering courses
are also falling, against the national trend.
Will this change? When an unskilled worker is dissatisfied, he or she can
take industrial action. An engineer, however, can easily swap either
profession or country. The current changes in Europe make the latter option
increasingly attractive.
There is no easy solution. But without engineers to design new products, no
amount of help from Mr Heseltine will save our industry.

</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, We do not agree with the view of Mr John Cheele (Letters, April 13)
that the adoption of a form of two-tier board system is the solution to
reconciling the position of executive directors in their respective roles of
directors and of executives.
Of course, there are areas of a company's activities where executives have a
perceived self-interest. Examples are audit, remuneration and nomination,
and companies should deal with possible conflicts of interest by
establishing committees of the board in these areas, having a majority of
non-executive directors, and reporting to the board as a whole.
This in no way derogates from the principle of a unitary board, with all
directors having equal responsibility.

FT  18 APR 92 / Man In The News: Cheerleader for the City - Sir Brian
Jenkins
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Each autumn, a Lord Mayor of London comes and goes, and few outside the
ornate Mansion House much care - or even notice - unless the tricorn hat,
lace and gold chain catch the corner of the television screen during the
chancellor's or prime minister's annual speeches to the City.
Not so with this year's incumbent. Sir Brian Jenkins, London's 664th Lord
Mayor, is hardly a household name, but he has done more to put the City
Corporation on the map than most of his predecessors. This week he won
plaudits for his calm and efficient direction of operations after the
bombing of the Baltic Exchange; last month he launched a high-profile
campaign to make London home to the proposed European Central Bank - a
delicate mission, given Mr Major's delicate balancing act on European
Monetary Union. And since taking office five months ago he has publicly
lambasted Labour's now-redundant plans to abolish the City Corporation and
create an elected pan-London authority.
'The general response has been marvellous,' Sir Brian says of the efforts of
staff, companies and back-up services after last week's carnage. As for the
Lord Mayor himself, he rushed out of the Blacksmiths' dinner and hardly got
a break for the next three days, trying to get things back to normal. 'It
showed how important it is for the City to have its own authority - and how
much it values it.'
Sir Brian, 56, is a City man par excellence. A senior partner with the
accountancy firm Coopers &amp; Lybrand Deloitte - head of its audit practice
until last year - his professional life has rarely strayed outside the
Square Mile. In 1980, he joined the Corporation as an Alderman, spent the
decade serving on its committees and became Sheriff in 1987. He sits as a
City JP, is a churchwarden at St Mary-le-Bow, and president of the Bow Lane
Association. Even his school - Tonbridge, Kent - has City connections: it is
run by the Skinners' Company.
His career is a snapshot of how to rise through that extraordinary
institution, which claims to be older than parliament itself - the City
Corporation. Few realise that the Corporation is more than the Lord Mayor's
parade: it is a fully-fledged local authority on a par with - though with
far greater powers and resources than - London's 32 borough councils.
Only a country with a hereditary monarchy and a House of Lords could
tolerate the archaic City Corporation in the 1990s. It operates like this.
Some 14,000 voters - most of them non-residents - from 25 wards elect 159
common councilmen and 26 aldermen to run the Corporation. Each year one of
the aldermen is selected as Lord Mayor by his colleagues from two candidates
nominated by the 15,000 liverymen of the City's guilds. Livery companies are
successors of 11th-century religious and social fraternities: there are now
100 of them, ranging from the ancient Apothecaries and Fishmongers companies
to Sir Brian's own Worshipful Company of Information Technologists.
After that, it may not seem odd that the Corporation should have its own
police force, plus responsibility for Epping Forest, Hampstead Heath, the
Old Bailey, and the Quarantine Station at Heathrow Airport.
For all its peculiarities and mediaeval customs, the Corporation works. 'It
is inconceivable that anyone in his right mind would tamper with us unless
there were strong evidence that London would be better off as a result,'
says Sir Brian. 'Rather than dwell on further organisational change, those
responsible for London should find ways of co-operating with each other.
Every businessman knows you re-organise when you can't manage to do things
well as they are - and now the election is over I hope we can put that
debate behind us.'
Promoting London as venue for the Central Bank is top priority for the rest
of his term. Last month the Corporation voted Pounds 1m for the task; Sir
Brian has lobbied the European Commission, and has trips planned to Paris,
Athens, Madrid, Berlin and Luxembourg to further the cause.
The bank may never materialise - in the Maastricht timeframe, at least. But
if it does, the Lord Mayor is adamant that London should be its home - and
by implication that sterling should be subsumed in the European currency.
'The case for London is compelling: it's not a question of doing down the
competition, but of emphasising the vast experience and expertise contained
in this City. By any objective test, London is the best location.'
And what of the Corporation itself, now the electorate has issued a
reprieve? 'The Corporation's primary task is to act for the City,' says Sir
Brian, but he is emphatic that 'we should not see the City in isolation. We
are a great Hoover taking out of the system - and we ought to be putting a
lot back.'
He is keen for the City to support - perhaps even run - the London Promotion
Centre floated by Michael Heseltine and promised in the Tory manifesto.
Somerset House is a likely venue. Appropriately, his sponsored charity for
the year is 'Learning Together' - a project run by Community Service
Volunteers to encourage undergraduates across the country to volunteer to
spend an afternoon a week helping in a local state school.
At the end of the day, though, a local authority serving 5,000 residents and
extending one and five-eighths miles at its longest and seven-eighths of a
mile at its shortest is bound to look faintly ridiculous. It might be
otherwise: the likely demise of the Docklands Development Corporation in the
mid-1990s could offer a golden opportunity for the City Corporation to marry
London's new and old business districts - were Sir Brian and his successors
to impress Michael Howard, the new environment secretary, of the merits.
Will they even try? 'Ah, that's tricky, old boy,' says a Corporation
insider. 'There are lots of residents down there - it would mean party
politics and all that.' The City, of course, has no politics.

NUCLEAR Electric, the state-owned nuclear power utility, will have to carry
out more safety work on its Trawsfynydd station in north Wales before the
safety authorities will allow it to restart.
The station has been shut down for 15 months because of concern about
embrittlement in its ageing Magnox reactors. The utility said on Thursday
that the Nuclear Installations Inspectorate had not accepted the case for

FT  18 APR 92 / Brussels warns on Greek economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   ATHENS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Commission has issued a strong warning on the problems of the
deficit-plagued Greek economy, and called for new revenue-raising measures
to be implemented immediately.
A confidential Commission report proposes the introduction of two economic
packages to raise Dr1,000bn (Pounds 2.9bn) in extra income by the end of
1993. This would offset projected losses resulting from income tax reform
and deferred interest payments on the rapidly growing public debt.
The economy ministry took the unusual step of making the report available to
journalists, in what appeared to be an effort to heighten Greeks' awareness
of their economic predicament.
The report said that if Greece was to participate in European monetary
union, 'a very substantial, vigorous and effective adjustment package is
needed immediately, and must be followed by further continuous and sustained
measures'. The report suggested that a Dr312bn revenue package be launched
next month.
Mr Stefanos Manos, economy minister, has been considering further spending
cuts. But he faces objections from other cabinet ministers who fear the
political cost of fresh austerity measures. The government's popularity is
already at low ebb because of a public sector pay freeze, imposed with
inflation above 18 per cent.
Greece last year failed to meet most targets set under a medium-term
economic stabilisation programme launched in return for an Ecu2.2bn (Pounds
1.54bn) loan by the EC.
The government's net borrowing requirement fell more slowly than forecast,
in 1991, to 14.1 per cent of gross domestic product, compared with a target
of 10.4 per cent. Also, the government was unable to service the public debt
fully, because of a Dr238bn shortfall in tax revenues.
Greece has shown some reluctance in the past to follow the advice of
Commission officials monitoring the economy.
Commission officials have also expressed doubts about the accuracy of Greek
government departmental figures, according to economy ministry officials.
The report noted that forecasts for 1992 appeared 'overly optimistic' and
pointed out that net borrowing requirements had been understated last year.

FT  18 APR 92 / Housing starts lift US economic hopes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN unexpected jump in US housing starts last month to their highest level
for two years yesterday raised hopes for a slow economic recovery.
Analysts were also cheered by better than expected trade figures for
February. A surge in exports led to a deficit of only Dollars 3.4bn (Pounds
1.9bn), the smallest monthly shortfall for nearly nine years.
Other signs of economic strength included a drop in claims for unemployment
insurance in early April and a rise in an index of manufacturing activity
compiled by the Federal Reserve bank of Philadelphia.
The Commerce Department said housing starts rose 6.4 per cent to a
seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1,345,000. Most analysts had expected a
decline, following sharp increases in previous months. Starts are now
running nearly 60 per cent above the trough reached in January last year.
The growth may falter, however, given demographic trends that have reduced
demand for housing. The increase last month reflected a big and probably
erratic gain in starts for apartment buildings. Starts for single-family
housing, the mainstay of the residential market, fell slightly.
The decline in the trade deficit reflected a Dollars 2.4bn rise in exports
to Dollars 37.8bn - a record in cash terms - and a Dollars 0.2bn fall in
imports to Dollars 41.2bn. Exports in the first two months of the year were
8.1 per cent up on the same period last year.
The strength of exports in February partly reflected a jump in aircraft
sales, which move erratically on a monthly basis. Officials indicated slower
demand in foreign markets might pose problems for US exporters this year.
These more encouraging reports followed lacklustre figures for retail sales
and industrial production this week, highlighting the halting nature of the
economic recovery.

FT  18 APR 92 / Russia brushes CIS partners aside on Start treaty
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
RUSSIA alone will ratify the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (Start) with
the US, in spite of demands from other former Soviet states holding nuclear
weapons to be co-signatories, according to Mr Andrei Kozyrev, the Russian
foreign minister.
Start ratification has been delayed by the collapse of the Soviet Union,
co-signatory to the treaty. Mr Kozyrev said: 'The production of nuclear
weapons is on Russian territory, thus the dismantling must also be on
Russian territory. If you have to choose which of the four nuclear states
would sign the treaty, it must be Russia.'
The demand to be a Start co-signatory has been voiced by Ukraine among the
other three nuclear states, which include Belarus and Kazakhstan.
In an interview with the Financial Times, Mr Kozyrev stressed that war
between the former Soviet states - particularly Russia and Ukraine - was
'unthinkable'. But he warned that Russia was prepared to use 'every other
kind of leverage available to a great power', including economic embargos
and sanctions, 'to protect the interests of the Commonwealth of Independent
States and the interests of Russia'.
The foreign minister said a resolution due to go before the Russian
parliament demanding the return to Russia of Crimea, at present part of
Ukraine and home to the Black Sea Fleet, could 'have a destabilising
effect'. But he said Crimea should hold a referendum to decide its status.
Last night the Crimean parliament's presidium recognised as valid a petition
signed by nearly 250,000 people calling for a referendum on independence 'in
union with other states'. If ratified by the parliament, the referendum
could be held in June.
Mr Kozyrev said: 'It is extremely important that Russian-Ukrainian relations
be kept within the CIS framework. Only under that would the frontiers
between us be guaranteed. We respect very much Ukrainian independence but
they must be realistic in dealing with Russia not to destabilise the
situation.'
The foreign minister said he had approached neutral countries such as
Austria and Finland to provide officers for CIS peacekeeping forces which
could be deployed in the disputed enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh and Moldova,
where there have been clashes over the Trans-Dnestrian region.

FT  18 APR 92 / Brady happy with Russian reform plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RUSSIA'S economic reform programme remains intact and the planned financial
support for it from the International Monetary Fund should be agreed in May,
according to Mr Nicholas Brady, US treasury secretary.
He said the concessions made by the Russian government in the past week's
session of the Russian Congress of People's Deputies might amount to 'a
very, very slight deterioration' of the programme.
But the US had not changed its support for the economic reform efforts of
President Boris Yeltsin and his first deputy prime minister, Yegor Gaidar,
or its view that work on western financial support for Russia should
continue.
Mr Brady, who spoke to journalists on Thursday after briefing Mr Norman
Lamont, the UK chancellor, about his trip to Moscow and eastern Europe, said
there were some encouraging economic signs in Russia and eastern Europe. The
proliferation of street markets in Moscow pointed to the emergence of an
entrepreneurial spirit. Low east European wage levels relative to those in
western industrialised countries should encourage investment and exports.
However, Mr Brady warned that growth in the industrial world was too low to
deal with the problems of the former communist countries and below the level
needed in the Group of Seven leading industrial countries and the rest of
the world.
He indicated the US would again raise the issue of growth when G7 finance
ministers and central bank governors meet in Washington this month.
A year ago, Mr Brady ruffled feathers in Europe and Japan by urging more
expansionary policies to combat a slowdown in growth. Following his latest
trip, he said government officials in Europe now shared US concerns.
Mr David Mulford, US treasury under-secretary for international affairs,
said Japan could adopt a 'more stimulative attitude' to investment as part
of a plan to boost activity, while there was a growing recognition in
Germany that the country's mix of policies might be hindering growth.
Germany's high interest rates were 'not just a Bundesbank issue', Mr Mulford
said.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Alan Greenspan, US Federal Reserve chairman, sought to reassure financial
markets yesterday that recent sharp falls in Japanese share prices would not
have serious effects in other countries.
Testifying before the Senate banking committee in Washington, he said the
Fed's unexpected decision last week to cut short-term interest rates by a
quarter-point to 3.75 per cent reflected weak growth of the money supply and
bank credit. It was not a response to sharp falls in Japanese share prices.
'In my judgment, the impact on the US from Japanese stock price changes to
date is likely to be limited.'
Mr Greenspan said Japan would continue to export capital, provided it ran a
current account surplus, regardless of share prices falls. Shifts in the
composition of capital exports might cause some price adjustments in
overseas markets but these 'need not be terribly disruptive'.
Japan held only 2-3 per cent of US Treasury securities and an even smaller
fraction of equities.
He said falls in Japanese share prices might lead to retrenchment by
Japanese banks, but world-wide credit conditions 'will not be substantially
weakened by a scaling back by Japanese banks'.
Japanese share price falls could have a significant negative effect on
Japanese investment and hence on growth. However, 'the separate contribution
of the stock market decline to weaker Japanese demand for US exports is not
expected to be large.'

FRESH fighting erupted in Bosnia-Hercegovina yesterday, as Serbia vowed not
to cave into foreign pressure to respect the latest ceasefire in the newly
independent former Yugoslav republic,
Clashes were reported in four strategic towns along Bosnia's northern
frontier with Croatia, in an apparent effort by Serbs to establish a
corridor linking Bosanska Krajina, the large Serb enclave in western Bosnia,
with Serbia. The fighting continued despite warnings from the US and the
European Community to Serbia and the Serbian-dominated federal army to
observe a ceasefire.
Mr Vladislav Jovanovic, the Serbian foreign minister, played down the
significance of the mounting international criticism, and said it was not an
'ultimatum'. Mr Radoman Bozovic, prime minister of Serbia, said: 'Serbia
will not bow to an economic blockade. We are not ready to submit to
pressures which are at the expense of Serbian dignity and economic
sovereignty.'
Gun battles and explosions shook Sarajevo only hours after Mr Cyrus Vance,
the United Nations special envoy, left the Bosnian capital, saying: 'I can't
say I'm an optimist in this situation.'
Battles in Bosnia have left more than 100 people dead and 170,000 homeless.
Most main roads have been cut, causing shortages of food and medical
supplies in many towns.

FT  16 APR 92 / Boom years predicted for Third World in 1990s: World Bank
expects 2.9% annual growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DOMESTIC economic reforms will lead to much improved growth prospects for
developing countries in the 1990s, according to a study* published today by
the World Bank.
The bank projects per capita growth of 2.9 per cent a year in the 1990s,
compared with only 1.2 per cent in the debt-ridden 1980s. This represents a
return almost to the golden years of the 1960s, when per capita growth
averaged 3.3 per cent a year in the Third World.
Eastern Europe, however, is set to remain one of the slowest-growing
regions. The bank projects per capita growth of only 1.6 per cent a year in
the region, well below that in Asia or Latin America. No forecasts were made
for former Soviet republics.
The decade started badly for developing countries with per capita incomes
falling in both 1990 and 1991. Most countries continue to face a difficult
external environment:
growth in big industrial countries is likely to average 2.6 per cent a year,
slightly less than in the 1980s;
concessional finance will be scarce, with only the strongest economies able
to tap private capital markets;
real interest rates will stay high at about 3 per cent;
commodity prices are expected to remain at current low levels in the short
term before rising in the second half of the decade.
The bank bases its optimism mainly on 'sweeping policy reforms' taking place
in the developing world. It says countries in every region have sharply
reduced trade quotas and tariffs, resulting in a doubling of the bank's
index of 'trade openness' in the past decade. Trade liberalisation should
underpin real export growth of 7 per cent a year in the 1990s - the best
performance in 35 years.
The report calls on developed countries to support these trends by
dismantling their own trade barriers, particularly those erected against
manufactured goods. It says a 50 per cent reduction in trade barriers in the
US, Japan and the EC would raise developing country exports by more than
Dollars 50bn (Pounds 28bn) - almost as much as the net flow of development
aid.
However, the distribution of the benefits of trade liberalisation in rich
countries would be uneven. Bank figures show that east Asia would probably
win more than 50 per cent of the additional export orders. Latin America
would account for a further 20 per cent. Eastern Europe might win little
more than 7 per cent of the new markets.
The study warns developing country exporters not to rely solely on cheap
labour as a source of competitiveness. It recommends greater investment in
transport and telecommunications and says countries that fail to invest in
education, training and information technology 'will find it increasingly
difficult to compete successfully in the global market for manufactures at
any acceptable wage.'

FT  16 APR 92 / Finland sees first signs of economic recovery
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE worst of the Finnish recession may be over, helped by a pick-up in
timber and engineering exports, according to the Confederation of Finnish
Industries (CFI) yesterday.
The quarterly survey of 580 companies reports an increase in new orders and
says export orders are expected to increase further in the spring.
The survey contains the first signs of optimism among industrialists over
the economy. Last year, Finland's GDP declined 6.1 per cent, and the
government was forced recently to produce an emergency economic package to
avert devaluation.
Exports to Germany and to east Asian markets increased in the first quarter.
Both forestry and engineering, traditionally two of Finland's most important
sectors, are expected to show a further recovery in exports in coming
months.
However, the CFI warns that construction and textiles sectors expect new
orders to continue to decline.
Industrial production during the first quarter was slightly better than
expected although still below last year. Expectations for the next six
months are still 'extremely conservative,' although the survey predicts an
increase in industrial production in the second quarter, partly due to
seasonal factors.
Although 84 per cent of companies report idle capacity, the CFI says this is
slightly better than last year. Capacity utilisation improved a little in
March, especially in forestry and engineering.
The CFI says industrial investment continues to decline, with the biggest
falls in the building industry. However, it predicts that the fall in
investment will be halted within a year, but will remain at a low level.

FT  16 APR 92 / Radical reformers gain more time for programme
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Russian parliament yesterday adopted a declaration which allowed the
government to claim that it was free to pursue radical economic reforms
after a week of confrontation with deputies, writes John Lloyd.
'This declaration gives the government the possibility of acting according
to reality, and gives us more time. The question of resignation is now off
the agenda,' said Mr Alexander Shokhin, the deputy prime minister.
Mr Peter Aven, chairman of the committee on foreign economic relations, said
the declaration allowed ministers complete discretion over the timing of
measures to soften the blow of the reforms.
He added: 'The reality is that the budget cannot afford these measures, and
so we cannot do them.'
Under the compromise, an earlier demand that a law on the structure and
method of appointing the government be produced within three months was
preserved.
However, it will not need to be implemented until the beginning of December.
This gives the president and government until then end of the year to
continue on the same course without taking serious account of parliamentary
pressure.
However, Mr Aven said he expected new ministers would be appointed to the
cabinet by the end of the Congress, expected to be on Saturday.

FT  16 APR 92 / Fed fears for US recovery as industrial growth slows
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE pace of US industrial growth slowed last month with output rising only
0.2 per cent, compared with a 0.5 per cent gain in February, the Federal
Reserve reported yesterday.
The figure was in line with analysts' forecasts and followed other recent
evidence of a sluggish economy including a fall in retail sales and flat
employment last month.
The Fed said production declined at an annual rate of 4.1 per cent in the
first quarter relative to the final quarter of last year, mainly because of
a sharp fall in output in January. This was the second successive quarter of
industrial contraction.
On an annual comparison, however, industrial production was up 2.1 per cent
in March, reflecting a recovery in output last summer.
Most forecasters continue to project a mild economic recovery this year with
growth of gross domestic product accelerating to an annual rate of 2-3 per
cent, compared with 0.4 per cent at the end of last year.
The Federal Reserve, however, remains anxious about the pace of recovery.
Last week it surprised financial markets by signalling a quarter-point cut
in short-term interest rates to 3.75 per cent, the first reduction since
December. Many analysts anticipate a further modest easing of monetary
policy if the economy fails to gather momentum.
Industrial production is expected to advance sluggishly in coming months.
This reflects relatively strong growth of demand in the first quarter as a
whole and a projected rebuilding of corporate inventories after liquidation
of stocks in recent months.
Figures released yesterday showed that the ratio of business inventories to
sales continued to fall in February, reflecting stronger than expected
demand.
Most industrial sectors were sluggish in March. Manufacturing output edged
up 0.1 per cent but capacity utilisation at factories fell 0.1 per cent to
77 per cent. Output of construction supplies fell 0.2 per cent.
Output of non-durable consumer goods rose 0.4 per cent, but this mainly
reflected a sharp 2.1 per cent rise in the output of utilities, a reaction
after declines due to unseasonably warm weather in January and February.
The strongest sector was durable consumer goods, which rose 0.5 per cent
despite a decline in car production.

FT  16 APR 92 / O&amp;Y bondholders grant reprieve
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE HOLDERS of an Dollars 800m (Pounds 453m) Eurobond issued by Olympia &amp;
York have indicated that they will not yet declare the cash-strapped
Canadian property developer in default, in spite of its failure to make a
scheduled interest payment.
O&amp;Y was to pay annualised interest totalling Dollars 62m on March 25 to
holders of the bond, which is not publicly traded and is secured by one of
the towers of New York's World Financial Centre. A 20-day grace period
expired last Tuesday without payment being made.
The World Financial Centre in lower Manhattan is almost fully occupied and
is assumed to be one of O&amp;Y's healthiest properties. O&amp;Y's failure to pay
interest on the bond suggests that rent income has been channelled into less
liquid parts of the company and underlines the weakness of its strategy of
compartmentalising its debt restructuring in about a dozen different lender
groups.
The bondholders, mostly Japanese institutional investors, are represented by
Nomura Securities. At a recent meeting in Tokyo chaired by Nomura, they are
understood to have agreed to extend the grace period.
O&amp;Y has assured them that the value of the building is adequate to cover the
principal amount of the loan. Much the same arrangement was made last month
with banks which provided a CDollars 450m (Pounds 215.7m) construction loan
secured by the 68-storey Scotia Plaza tower in Toronto. The principal on the
Scotia Plaza loan was due on March 31.
At a meeting with lenders earlier this week, O&amp;Y proposed a 90-day freeze of
all principal repayments on its Dollars 12bn debt, as well as some deferrals
of interest. It also requires Pounds 100m of new money for London's Canary
Wharf and just under CDollars 100m for its Canadian operations.
Mr Steve Miller, who is heading O&amp;Y's restructuring effort, said the company
eventually hopes to repay its debts in full but concessions will be required
from lenders.
O&amp;Y has also failed to make payments on a Canadian commercial paper
programme. Redemptions, totalling about CDollars 200m, are awaiting
completion of the sale and leaseback of Exchange Tower, a 36-storey building
in central Toronto, which is the security for the CP programme.

FT  16 APR 92 / London Stock Exchange: Price war talk hits Vodafone
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN, JOEL KIBAZO, COLIN MILLHAM and CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TALK of a price war in the cellular communications market, combined with a
large placing of stock, hit Vodafone yesterday, the shares slipping 2 to
356p in record turnover of 22m.
The placing of two lots of 5m shares at 350p, believed to have been done by
James Capel, added fuel to the rumour that rival cellular operator Cellnet
was planning to cut its prices - and that Vodafone had promised to match any
reductions to protect its market share. However, analysts played down the
link between the two events, arguing that the placing had been hanging over
the market for some time.
Cellnet contacted some analysts yesterday to deny the price war story.
However, some price restructuring is seen as necessary before the launch
next year of PCN, a cheaper but more specialised version of cellular, with
some in the market seeing yesterday's rumour - centred around Cellnet's
secretive 'Project Liberty' - as the start of a phoney war.
Difficulties placing 60m Midland shares were said to have ensured that the
stock was depressed and closed a penny off at 364p with only 2.8m shares
traded in a particularly strong market.
Securities house Hoare Govett was believed to be offering the bulk of the
Kuwait Investment Office's 10.5 per cent stake in Midland Bank at 362p per
share. This followed its attempt to place the shares on Tuesday at the same
price.
Market commentators have said that Hoare had only managed to pre-place about
a third of the shares. One trader said the apparent difficulty in placing
the stake suggested that there was unlikely to be a rival offer to Hongkong
Bank's 378p per share all-paper bid for Midland. Hoare Govett said it was
unable to comment but hoped to say something soon.
Guinness fell 12 to 576p, on turnover of 4.6m shares, but several analysts
questioned the reasoning behind the move. Dealers were concerned by reports
of lower cognac sales in Japan by Guinness's associate LVMH and by fears
that the company will change a convertible debenture and loan stock into 42m
ordinary shares in June.
Rumours of a downgrading were denied by Lehman Bothers, with the US
investment bank and Nomura remaining bullish on the stock.
Dividend worries over Tarmac proved justified as the building group slashed
its payout from 11.25p to 5.5p. The continuing poor outlook for the UK
construction market, allied to what many consider an overvalued land bank,
led to a generally gloomy short-term prognosis from many analysts.
Mr Howard Seymour at BZW said: 'If the new management strategy starts to
have any effect over the next year, we may re-consider our stance. But in
the meantime, we remain a hold.' The shares fell 6 to 139p in the heaviest
turnover for five years of 19m.
Large scale switching by overseas investors out of the Electricity Package,
down Pounds 25 at Pounds 3038, and into Scot Hydro, up 5 at 105 1/2 p, was
the main feature in a generally strong utilities sector. Turnover in Scot
Hydro was a very high 14m shares. Renewed demand was seen for the water
companies, with Mr Stephen Doe, at Smith New Court, describing the water
stocks as 'screamingly cheap.' Wessex rose 12 to 463p and Thames 10 to 426p.
Hanson saw heavy turnover as, according to one specialist, investors
continued to speculate that it 'might not be a million miles away from doing
its next deal'. The shares closed steady at 235 1/2 p with 16.6m dealt. ICI,
in which Hanson holds a 20m share stake, gained 32 to 1347p. Hanson paid
1194 1/2 p for its stake just under a year ago.
Forte's well-signalled results caused few surprises, although a
higher-than-expected interest rate charge and gloomy UK occupancy figures
prompted downgrades from most analysts to the range of Pounds 125m-140m for
this year. The shares rose 4 to 254p.
British Gas gained 6 1/2 to 273p as a number of houses pointed out the
relative underperformance in the shares.
Lasmo gained 11 to 211p after announcing that it had completed the sale of
three tankers, which together with a previously announced sale would bring
in an estimated Dollars 125m (Pounds 72.6m). There was also talk that the
company was about to announce the disposal of its Wilmington refinery and
petrol retailing business but other analysts were sceptical.
Among foods, Unilever gained 24 to 920p, boosted by a recommendation from
Nomura.
Smiths Industries were wanted, the shares adding 14 to 309p, after a
positive analysts results meeting. The market was cheered by a 5 per cent
dividend increase.
Mr Clive Forestier-Walker at Charterhouse Tilney said this is an 'excellent
result' and added: 'The company has good prospects based on the outstanding
order book.'
Vickers rose 8 to 167p, as vague talk about the sale of its Rolls-Royce
Motors subsidiary returned.
A squeeze coupled with vague bid talk saw Glynwed International jump 21 to
263p.
Turnover in Roll-Royce rose to 7.3m in two way business, with a leading US
house reported to have done most of the day's trade. The shares closed 1 1/2
firmer at 169p.
US buying, after a positive industry outlook from the company's chief
executive in Canada, lifted British Airways 11 to 279p.
The prospect of a new cash call from Eurotunnel when it reports figures next
week continued to overhang the shares and they fell another 9 to 370p, a
1992 low.
BICC surged 15 to 340p as Hoare Govett reiterated its buy recommendation.

Wall Street
US MARKETS soared to new highs yesterday following further quarterly reports
which indicated that business conditions are improving, writes Patrick
Harverson in New York.
At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 47.63 at 3,353.76, the
second consecutive record close for the blue-chip index. The gains were less
spectacular for broader and secondary markets.
The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 finished up 3.82 at 416.21, while the Nasdaq
composite index of over-the-counter stocks rose 5.23 to 600.04. Turnover on
the NYSE was 231m shares.
As on Tuesday, positive company earnings reports provided the momentum for
solid gains across the board as investors purchased shares in anticipation
of a big improvement in corporate profitability over the coming quarters.
Investors favoured not only cyclical stocks which are most likely to benefit
from the economic upswing, but also spread their buying across a range of
sectors.
The market has also been underpinned by hopes of further monetary easing by
the Federal Reserve. The Fed cut its fed funds rate last week, raising
expectations that a more positive step, most likely a reduction in the
discount rate, may soon follow.
Among individual stocks, AMR, parent group of American Airlines, rose
Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 71 after reporting first quarter net income of
Dollars 20m, a substantial turnaround from the Dollars 195m loss incurred at
the same stage a year ago.
A variety of stocks moved in response to earnings reports, not all of them
in a positive direction. Among them were: Merck, down Dollars 4 at Dollars
151 1/4 on disappointing net income of Dollars 1.47 a share; Upjohn, down
Dollars  3/8 at Dollars 36 3/8 on news of a slight increase in earnings;
CBS, up Dollars 7 1/2 at Dollars 185 1/2 on a return to profitability; and
Sprint, up Dollars 2 3/8 at Dollars 23 3/4 in turnover of 2m shares
following the announcement of a big increase in first quarter profits.
Caterpillar jumped Dollars 4 3/8 to Dollars 53 7/8 on the news that the
United Auto Workers Union had told striking workers at the company to go
back to work. At least one broking house, Wertheim Schroder, raised its
rating on Caterpillar because of the end of the strike.
Several stocks continued to draw strength from Tuesday's earnings
announcements, including Goodyear, up Dollars 4 at Dollars 75 3/8 ,
International Paper, up Dollars 3 7/8 at Dollars 76 1/4 , General Electric,
up Dollars 1 1/4 at Dollars 78, and Alcoa, Dollars 3 higher at Dollars 74
1/2 .
On the over-the-counter market Microsoft jumped Dollars 11 7/8 to Dollars
128 7/8 in turnover of 4.6m shares after a federal judge threw out most of
Apple Computer's arguments that Microsoft and Hewlett-Packard had breached
copyright on certain characteristics of Apple's Macintosh computer.
The news persuaded two broking houses, Lehman Brothers and Merrill Lynch, to
raise their ratings on Microsoft.
Centocor slumped Dollars 12 3/4 to Dollars 18 1/2 in turnover of 17m shares
on the news that the Food and Drug Administration has said that it had not
seen sufficient evidence to approve the company's drug for the treatment of
septic shock after surgery.
Canada
THE TORONTO market finished mixed, as falling gold shares offset gains in
other sectors. Based on preliminary data, the composite index ended 1.31
points lower at 3,411.33, although advancing issues edged declines 287 to
256.
Volume was 33.8m shares, inflated by two block trades, against 28.2m shares
on the previous day, and trading value was CDollars 350.6m against CDollars
318m.
The gold sub-group plunged 4.20 per cent on index, as gold sank Dollars 3.30
to Dollars 336.25 an ounce in New York.
The energy sector fell slightly and mining was unchanged.

FT  16 APR 92 / Government Bonds: ERM rumour gives short-lived boost to
gilts
</HEADLINE>

SPECULATION that sterling and the peseta were about to be brought into the
narrow band of the Exchange Rate Mechanism gave a temporary lift to the UK
and Spanish government bond markets yesterday. However, both rumours had
been largely rejected by markets by the end of the day.
For gilts, the rumour helped give a further lift after the seven-point rally
of the past week. Much of the increase has been fuelled by foreign
investors, and it was these investors who were again reported to be buying
on speculation about a move to the narrow band.
While many in the market now expect such a move to be on the horizon, few
expect it imminently. A more likely time, suggested one analyst, would be
after the UK takes up the presidency of the European Community, when it
would have a more powerful political impact. A rise in gilt prices on the
back of the rumour was largely reversed later.
The benchmark 9.75 per cent gilt maturing 2002 closed at 104 9/32 on the
day, compared with 104 5/32 on Tuesday, shaving a fraction more off the
yield to take it to 9.1 per cent. The 9 per cent gilt maturing 2011 closed
up at 100 1/16 .
In a moderately busy day on Liffe, with 30,000 long gilt futures contracts
traded, prices moved in a narrow range, closing at 99 9/32 , down from the
opening of 99 3/8 .
SPANISH government bonds had reached the end of their recent strong run
before yesterday's rumour helped prices to a partial recovery of around 10
basis points.
Yields on 10-year Spanish bonds had fallen from 10.92 per cent to 10.81,
cutting the spread over German bunds back to under 3 per cent.
This recovery has been helped in part by favourable inflation data - showing
a 0.4 per cent rise in consumer prices in March - published earlier this
week. The figure apparently had not been leaked to the bond market in
advance, unlike inflation data in recent months.
THE GERMAN government bond market drifted towards the long Easter break with
few signs that traders were willing to take positions ahead of the holiday.
Bund futures on Liffe traded in a narrow range of 88.06-88.21 as the market
marked time, awaiting developments in the two areas most likely to give an
immediate direction to prices: the political situation in Russia, and the
outcome of the public sector pay dispute.
FRENCH government bonds marked time with the German market, though there was
reported to be some buying of five-year bonds at the expense of longer-dated
issues.
By the end of the day, five-year BTANs showed a yield of 8.78 per cent,
compared with a yield on the benchmark 8.5 per cent OAT due 2002 of 8.62 per
cent, pointing to a slight flattening of the yield curve.
That left 10-year OATs at around their highest against German bunds for some
time, with a spread of some 74 basis points. Most in the market have been
expecting a narrowing of the yield spread since the appointment of Mr Pierre
Beregovoy as prime minister last month.
US TREASURY prices eased slightly across the board in quiet trading
dominated by technical manoeuvring.
By late afternoon, the benchmark 30-year government issue was down 3/32 at
101 13/16 , yielding 7.870 per cent. The two-year note was also slightly
weaker, down Dollars  3/32 at 101 1/32 , yielding 5.170 per cent.
The absence of trading on the flood-hit Chicago Board of Trade futures
market again hampered the Treasuries market, although dealers were able to
do some futures trading through London.
The day's only economic news - a 0.2 per cent rise in March industrial
production and flat February business inventories - were in line with
expectations and had no impact on sentiment. That left trading to be
dominated by profit-takers and dealers testing the market's downside.
The Federal Reserve arranged overnight system repurchase agreements with Fed
funds trading firm at 4 1/8 per cent. The intervention was meant to bring
the rate down to its new target of 3 3/4 per cent. By midday, Fed funds had
eased to Dollars 3 7/8 per cent.
A BOUNCE in the Japanese equity market and a firm yen gave some support to
the nervous Japanese government bond market. However, after the share price
volatility of recent days, few gained much confidence from the news.
Official data also gave some support to the market, with confirmation of a
0.1 per cent decline in industrial production in February (the previous
estimate had been a decline of 0.6 per cent). The benchmark bond No 129
closed unchanged on a yield of 5.46 per cent, having traded in a narrow
range.

BANQUE Indosuez, the French group, announced yesterday it had set up a New
York-based US investment banking arm, Indosuez Capital.
The new unit, headed by Mr Les Lieberman, a former investment banker at Wall
Street finance house Kidder Peabody, will give North American clients access
to Banque Indosuez's capital, its worldwide investment banking network, and
its institutional customer base.
Mr Lieberman said Indosuez Capital would complement the parent's existing
successful US trading operation, which trades foreign exchange, fixed-income
securities and non-equity derivatives.
The new unit will focus on merchant banking activities, financial
restructurings, private placements in debt and equity securities, and
mergers and acquisitions. Its establishment, however, will not effect the
existing arrangement with Blackstone Group, the US investment banking
boutique which works with Banque Indosuez on some deals.

FT  16 APR 92 / International Company News: Production edges higher at Anglo
American mines
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOLD mines in the Anglo American group, the world's largest gold
producer, had a satisfactory first three months to March with working costs
well contained and production slightly up.
Gold production rose marginally to 63,490kg from 63,225kg and unit costs
were only 1 per cent higher at R26,367 per kg. The average gold price
received dropped 1 per cent to R33,483 per kg, and available profit was down
by 9 per cent to R167m (Dollars 58m).
The production achievements were overshadowed by a series of seismic-related
accidents at Western Deep Levels mine which claimed 27 lives during the
quarter. Mr Clem Sunter, chairman of the gold and uranium division, said
increasing safety was now the main challenge facing them.
The best performance came from Freegold, the world's largest gold mine,
which lifted available profit to R81.7m from R73.2m. Gold production was 3
per cent up at 28,337kg and, contrary to the trend at Anglo's other mines,
the gold price received rose slightly to R34,473 per kg from R33,781 per kg.
This was the result of successful forward selling. Mr Sunter said that
Freegold's more marginal status meant that management felt it prudent to
hedge a greater portion of its production than at richer mines like Vaal
Reefs and Western Deep Levels.
The mine did very well to cut unit costs by 3.5 per cent to R27,845 per kg.
Mr Sunter noted that for the financial year to March, total costs had
declined by 1.4 per cent to R3.2bn, in line with Anglo's prediction, made in
1990, that it would hold working costs flat for two years.
Available profit dropped by 25 per cent at Vaal Reefs to R48.3m. Mr Lionel
Hewitt, managing director, said the mine had in fact had a good production
quarter, the discrepancy being the result of two extraordinary contributions
to last quarter's figures. Gold production was marginally higher at
18,773kg.
Western Deep Levels results were badly affected by a number of seismic
events which not only caused considerable loss of life, but caused damage to
property of more than R10m. Gold production dropped by 10.6 per cent to
8,996kg while available profit dropped to R16.8m from R25.7m.
Elandsrand and Ergo had steady quarters, while Sallies, which treats waste
rock dumps, slipped into loss as it encountered poor grades.

DELTA Air Lines has received conditional final approval from the US
Department of Transportation, to fly between London and Detroit, writes
Nikki Tait in New York.
The route authority used to belong to Pan Am, and since the international
carrier's demise Delta and Northwest Airlines, which uses Detroit as a hub
airport, have been battling to take over the route.
The DOT approval is conditional on the US courts deciding Pan Am's contract
to transfer the route to Delta is still valid.

REEBOK, the US sports shoe manufacturer, yesterday reported first-quarter
after-tax profits of Dollars 62.3m, up from Dollars 58.4m in the same period
a year earlier, writes Nikki Tait.
Sales rose from Dollars 695.3m to Dollars 797.4m and the shares gained
Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 33 1/2 on the news.
*****
CONRAIL, one of the large US railroad companies, said it expected 'slow but
steady' growth in volume through the second quarter and rest of the year,
writes Nikki Tait. It reported after-tax profits of Dollars 38m in the first
three months to end-March, against Dollars 18m in the same period a year
earlier. Revenues were Dollars 798m against Dollars 755m, with freight
volumes up by eight per cent over the first quarter of 1991.
*****
NORTHROP, US defence contractor, reported first-quarter net profits of
Dollars 47.2m or Dollars 1 a share, against a loss of Dollars 34.8m or
Dollars 0.74 a share in the same period last year, Reuter reports. Sales
rose to Dollars 1.3bn from Dollars 1.2bn in 1991.
*****
MCGRAW-Hill, the US publishing and information group, said first-quarter net
income rose to Dollars 14.1m or Dollars 0.29 a share on revenues of Dollars
454.8m, against Dollars 12.7m or Dollars 0.26 a share on Dollars 428.5m in
the 1991 first quarter, Reuter reports.

PROCTOR &amp; Gamble, the US consumer products giant, announced that Mr ichard
Nicolosi, group vice-president at the Proctor &amp; Gamble Company and president
of paper products, at Proctor &amp; Gamble USA, is leaving to 'pursue other

Mr Jeffrey Jones becomes vice-president of paper products business in the
US, taking responsibility for all paper interests other than cellulose and
specialities.

GENERAL DYNAMICS of the US has reported first-quarter earnings from
continuing operations of Dollars 72m, on sales of Dollars 2.12bn, compared
with earnings from continuing operations of Dollars 50m on sales of Dollars

The 1992 results excluded a Dollars 358m gain on the sale of Cessna
Aircraft.

<TEXT>
FORD MOTOR, the second-biggest US vehicle manufacturer, yesterday said it
intended to take a 50 per cent stake in Mazda Motor's US manufacturing
subsidiary, Mazda Motor Manufacturing Corporation (MMUC).
Ford, which suffered a record Dollars 2.3bn loss last year, said that it
would acquire its stake in MMUC through a stock purchase of newly issued
shares.
Ford has held a 25 per cent stake in the parent Mazda company for more than
12 years.
The proposal had been submitted to the US Federal Trade Commission and
Department of Justice for review.
Mr Howard Poling, chairman and chief executive, said: 'Ford is already a
very important customer and supplier for the Flat Rock plant, with such a
substantial stake in MMUC's success, it is only logical that we consider an
equity position that fits our role.'
Mazda said it would benefit from Ford's financial management expertise,
while Ford would have access to MMUC's high quality manufacturing system.
The move follows Ford's recent decision to invest Dollars 3bn in North
America over the next three years.
The companies, which have not put a figure on the transaction, said they
hoped to reach a final agreement by the end of June.
MMUC's Flat Rock, Michigan plant produces the Mazda 626 and MX-6 models and
the Ford Probe.
Next year, the Probe will become the first American-built right-hand-drive
Ford vehicle in recent history to be exported to Japan and the UK.
Mazda initially invested Dollars 550m in the plant, which has been operating
since September 1987. Since then, MMUC has produced more than 750,000
vehicles.

FT  16 APR 92 / International Company News: CBS recovers with Dollars 19.5m
profit in first three months
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
CBS, the US media group, yesterday reported a first-quarter operating profit
of Dollars 19.5m, a substantial recovery from the Dollars 54.6m loss
incurred at the same stage of 1991 when the Gulf war, a slump in advertising
demand and restructuring charges sent the company deep into the red.
The earnings were greeted warmly on Wall Street, and CBS shares rose Dollars
6 1/2 to Dollars 184 1/2 on the New York Stock Exchange in early trading.
Improvements in operating results at the CBS's nationwide network and its
group of regional television stations, and savings from reductions in
underlying costs, were the main reason behind the turnround in earnings,
said the company.
Mr Laurence Tisch, chairman and chief executive of CBS, said the company was
beginning to benefit from its new position as the top-ranked network in the
US, a position which he believed would soon feed through into advertising
revenues.
However, the domestic advertising climate remained difficult in the first
quarter.
CBS's coverage of American football's Superbowl and the Albertville winter
Olympics were a success, but excluding the revenue contribution from the two
special sporting events, the network's first-quarter sales were essentially
the same as a year ago. This was an indication that the weak economy
continued to restrain demand for television advertising.
A cyclical recovery in advertising demand is anticipated. Mr Tisch said
there was evidence in the opening weeks of this year's second quarter of a
'steadying of demand for network time'.
The company suffered from a big decline in interest income on investments
during the quarter, which fell to Dollars 7.5m from Dollars 65.8m in the
first three months of 1991, when sales of securities to fund a share
buy-back operation and the final settlement of the sale of CBS's recorded
music business brought windfall gains.
Gannett, the newspaper publisher that owns USA Today, lifted net income for
the first quarter to Dollars 55.5m or 39 cents a share from Dollars 50.1m,
or 32 cents, for the same period last year.
The increase came on revenue of Dollars 793.1m compared to Dollars 786.5m
for the same period last year.

   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MACMILLAN Bloedel, the Vancouver-based forest products company, has cited
the unremitting slump in the newsprint market and higher interest payments
as the main causes of a first-quarter loss.
MacMillan Bloedel's loss before payment of preferred share dividends was
CDollars 11m (Dollars 9.2m) or 12 cents a share, compared with earnings of
CDollars 3.8m, or zero per share, for the same period a year earlier. Sales
increased to CDollars 718.5m from CDollars 677.6m.
The company said that pulp prices rose marginally and that markets for
lumber and containerboard showed solid improvements.
An operating loss of CDollars 400,000 last year was turned into a CDollars
9.1m profit in the latest quarter.
Newsprint prices have continued to weaken, and machines have been shut down
to adjust to over-supplied markets. In addition, quarterly interest charges
jumped to CDollars 34.6m from CDollars 25.8m.
Producers have announced further price increases for pulp and for
containerboard.
The company said lumber markets were clouded by uncertainty over the US
housing industry and by the 14 per cent countervailing duty imposed by
Washington last month on softwood lumber imports from Canada.

FT  16 APR 92 / International Company News: Lyonnaise des Eaux-Dumez slips
18%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LYONNAISE des Eaux-Dumez, the French water and construction group, yesterday
announced an 18 per cent fall in net profits in 1991 from FFr1.42bn in 1990
to FFr1.17bn (Dollars 210m). The decline was due to a steep increase in
provisions on its leisure sector construction interests and on the Channel
tunnel project.
Mr Jerome Monod, chairman, said the group was showing signs of recovery from
last year's difficulties and that its net profits for this year 'will be
close to the level of profits for 1990'.
Lyonnaise which, like Generale des Eaux, the other big French water and
construction group, has recently diversified into new areas of activity and
different countries, had forewarned the stock market of the fall in net
profits in January when it cautioned that profits might have been reduced by
as much as 20 per cent.
As a result its shares were relatively stable after the announcement in
Paris yesterday, slipping by just FFr1 in a buoyant stock market from FFr514
to FFr513.
The group was forced to make hefty exceptional provisions of FFr2.1bn last
year mainly because of the effect of the economic slowdown on its leisure
and hotel construction projects. It was also affected by the dispute over
extra costs with Eurotunnel, its client on the Channel tunnel scheme, and by
the poor performance of Westburne, its Canadian subsidiary involved with
building materials and electrical equipment distribution.
However, Lyonnaise, which has made a number of sizeable asset sales in the
past year, helped to compensate for hefty provisions by making gains of
FFr1.9bn on such disposals.
At an operational level the group said that the economic climate had
affected all its businesses in and outside France. However, turnover rose by
21.5 per cent to FFr87.5bn during 1991. The rate of turnover growth on a
comparable basis - excluding the effect of changes in exchange rates - was
around 10 per cent.
Despite the decline in net profits, the board proposed holding the dividend
at FFr10 a share, given the more encouraging outlook for the current year.

FT  16 APR 92 / UK Company News: The impossible can be done at once, but
miracles take longer - Shareholders, bondholders and 60 banks all had
interests to protect. Maggie Urry unravels the saga of Brent Walker's
financial restructuring
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LITTLE SHORT of miraculous, was the final verdict of Brent Walker's chairman
on the group's Pounds 1.65bn financial restructuring, completed on the last
day of March. As other companies - like Heron, Olympia &amp; York and Speyhawk -
begin the same process, there are lessons to be learned from the Brent
Walker experience.
The restructuring plan - the biggest in UK corporate history - envisages the
group trading its way to a position by the end of 1997 where it can repay or
refinance its debt again on a normal commercial basis.
Like so many events in the 18-month-long process of sorting out the leisure
and property group's financial difficulties, the restructuring was completed
at the eleventh hour. A delay beyond midnight on March 31, when shareholder
approval for the restructuring ran out, could have pushed the group into
receivership.
From the autumn of 1990, when Brent Walker's difficulties became apparent,
until the restructuring was completed, the threat of receivership hung over
the group, its 14,000-plus employees, its unsecured trade creditors, and its
shareholders.
There was no doubt that receivership would leave the banks little, and the
other interested parties nothing. Throughout the process, banks were
calculating whether they would be better off approving a refinancing or
calling in a receiver. Mr John Leach, Brent Walker finance director, says
that, even in the days before the banks signed the final restructuring plan,
they were reworking their sums on the value of the two options.
What made the company capable of salvation, according to Mr Nick Lyle, a
partner in Touche Ross, the accountant, was that it had two businesses - its
pubs and its betting office chain - trading profitably and generating cash.
Mr Lyle, who headed the team employed by the banks to help produce a
business plan for the company, says that these two operations could service
a bit of the debt and hold out hope that one day they would be worth enough
to repay the principal. By comparison, he says, on an insolvency basis 'the
numbers looked pretty disappointing'. A forced seller in the middle of a
recession would get little for the businesses.
The task of sorting out the mess was phenomenal. But even so, there is a
belief among many of the participants that much time was wasted along the
way. Indeed the original plan was for the restructuring to be finished by
February last year, three months after the company's banks agreed to a
standstill on the debt in November 1990.
The restructuring plan was thrashed out by June last year but it took 10
months to get it agreed by shareholders, bondholders and banks.
In the period between, the debt mounted as interest rolled up. When the
standstill was signed, debt stood at Pounds 1.4bn but by the end it had
reached Pounds 1.65bn. The business plan written in spring last year had to
be rewritten by the autumn as trading conditions deteriorated.
One of the group's advisers blames 'the intransigence and inefficiency of
the banks. A lot of issues which could have been settled in a day or two
took weeks to resolve.'
The greatest problem was the large number of banks involved and the variety
of their interests. This was inevitable given the way Brent Walker had
financed its expansion.
The story of how Mr George Walker, one-time boxer, built the group through
the 1980s is now well known. A series of acquisitions - such as the Pounds
685m purchase of the William Hill betting office chain from Grand
Metropolitan, the food, drinks and retailing company, late in 1989 - and
property deals like the developments at Le Touquet in France and Puerto
Sherry in Spain - left the group with a range of different banks, with
different exposures, terms and security.
In all there were about 60 main bank lenders, with exposures ranging from
less than Pounds 1m to more than Pounds 100m, as well as bank groups such as
those in France and Spain which lent on particular property developments.
This became a common problem in the 1980s as old-fashioned relationship
banking was undermined by competition between banks frantic to lend. One
foreign bank, says Mr Nicholas Ward, Brent Walker's group managing director,
had opened a London office and headhunted a three-person team from a bank
which had already lent to Brent Walker. One of the team's first moves in its
new home was to ring Brent Walker and offer a loan.
The company found that it was usually the banks with the smallest loans
which caused the biggest problems. But the leading banks with the larger
exposures could not buy out the small ones without other banks wanting to
get out too.
Lord Kindersley, who became Brent Walker's chairman in January last year,
says that when he arrived he thought that the banks would have a common aim.
But, he says: 'You would not have been aware of an identity of interest from
the difficulties raised along the route.'
Mr Lyle says that the banks involved came from all over the world and had
'different cultures, different lending philosophies and different
attitudes'. Two of them were close to insolvency themselves. Many of the
banks, he says, had not done a detailed assessment of Brent Walker, but
merely lent because they knew that if they did not, then another bank would.
Those philosophical differences were on top of the variety of commercial
interests the banks had. 'Some banks were better placed than others,' says
Mr Lyle, 'some had security over a particular asset and could see that asset
covering their debt.' All the banks had to be persuaded to take a common
view.
This divergence between the banks was most obvious in the case of William
Hill. Brent Walker had bought William Hill using an off-balance sheet
company, which had a Pounds 350m loan from a syndicate of 30 banks, of which
17 were also in the main 47-bank group. But the interests of the two sets
did not always coincide.
As one of the two core businesses, William Hill is an essential source of
cash and future value for the lenders to Brent Walker. But banks which had
only lent to William Hill felt that they owed nothing to the Brent Walker
banks. Those which were in both would want to favour one side or the other
depending where their larger exposure was.
'A lot of the last three months has been wasted on William Hill,' says one
adviser. Trading had deteriorated as the recession worsened and people cut
down on gambling. The non-Brent Walker banks in the syndicate, which had
lent about 40 per cent of the total, threatened to pull out if they did not
get extra protection.
In the end a compromise was reached under which the maturity date of the
William Hill loan was shortened from December to March 1994. At that point
the loan could be refinanced or the Brent Walker banks might be prepared to
fund it.
The greatest setback, say the company's directors, was last summer when the
steering committee of banks, headed by Standard Chartered, accepted an
amendment to terms offered to bondholders on behalf of all the banks. But
then a handful of the banks refused to agree and another arrangement had to
be dreamt up.
Critical issues arose frequently, any of which could have pushed the group
over the brink. 'It was crisis management all the way through,' says Mr
Leach. Every morning there was an 8am meeting to review the current crises
and at midnight there would be another meeting to decide if people could go
home.
Some problems were almost comical. Mr Ward tells how one day a man turned up
in the group's French office saying he had been appointed by the commercial
court in Boulogne as a kind of receiver-in-waiting. Mr Ward had to fly over
to France to explain why the whole company should not be put into
receivership. The court appointee was not satisfied until he saw the sale of
the Le Touquet development completed.
Many others were distractions from the negotiations with the banks. The
removal of Mr Walker from the board was one such, as was the arrival of the
Serious Fraud Office, the proposed - but, as it proved, unrealistic - bid
for the company from Lonrho, the international trading group, and the
unravelling of the Walker Power joint property ventures.
Throughout, the negotiations and documentation work demanded long hours,
often late into the night. In the last week before the restructuring was
completed, a lawyer arrived for a meeting on Tuesday having had eight hours
sleep since the previous Saturday. The story is typical.
Mr Ken Scobie, chief executive, describes the process of producing listing
particulars for the new shares to be issued through the restructuring, as a
pantomime. The legal fees involved were greater than the market
capitalisation of the company, he says. Directors had to verify everything
in the 188-page document and would spend whole Sundays at the task. By the
end, Mr Scobie says, 'the only thing I had not done was produce my
grandmother's birth certificate'.
Every stage of the restructuring involved huge amounts of paperwork, with
teams of lawyers each vetting them all and duplicating effort. Brent Walker
paid for the agent banks' lawyers, all the banks' lawyers and the
bondholders' lawyers, but some banks were also employing further teams of
lawyers.
Now that the restructuring has been completed, Lord Kindersley hopes that
life will be simpler - although the banks will have to be kept informed on a
regular basis of progress. He believes that now the banks have a majority of
the group's equity - because Pounds 250m of debt has been swapped for shares
 -there will be an identity of interest at last, with everyone working to
create value for shareholders.
The group's new management team believes that the banks did not move fast
enough to bring in professional management.
It is also now widely agreed that the entrepreneur who builds up a business
is unlikely to have the skills to manage it in crisis.
Brent Walker's internal financial reporting had been weak, Mr Leach says.
And under the November 1990 standstill agreement, it was 'obliged to provide
monthly accounts that ICI would have had difficulty producing'.
Mr Lyle says that the banks were slow to accept the principle that the
company would have a good chance of surviving if it did not have the burden
of servicing its debts entirely in the short term. The debt-to-equity swap
resulted.
He says that banks must be prepared to lend not simply on security but by
taking a view of their borrowers' likely profit and cash streams.
He works Brent Walker's numbers out thus: of the Pounds 1.65bn debt, Pounds
250m has been converted into equity. Another Pounds 400m will be paid off
through asset sales made over the next few years. That leaves Pounds 1bn of
debt - still high, but 'William Hill and the Brent Walker pubs could be
worth more than that by the end of 1997'.

FT  16 APR 92 / UK Company News: Higgs and Hill reveals Pounds 17m loss and
cuts final to 3p
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RECESSION IN its core markets of construction, property and housing forced
Higgs and Hill to make exceptional charges of Pounds 20.9m and report a
pre-tax loss in the year to December 31.
Announcing losses of Pounds 16.7m, against profits of Pounds 6.84m in 1990,
Mr John Theakston, group chief executive, summed up: 'It's not been a lot of
fun out there.'
Higgs is recommending a cut in the final dividend to 3p (14p) to make a
sharply reduced total of 9p (20p), which is uncovered. The company said the
final payment, combined with an 'appropriate' interim, should be seen as the
base for future dividends.
Turnover fell sharply to Pounds 345.2m (Pounds 488m) due to volume declines
in its main markets. Operating profits dropped to Pounds 6.97m (Pounds
18.6m). A reduced interest charge of Pounds 2.75m (Pounds 4.35m) could not
prevent profits before exceptionals falling to Pounds 4.22m (Pounds 14.2m).
Construction was worst affected and turnover fell more than 25 per cent to
Pounds 309.4m (Pounds 422.3m). The fall was compounded by the closure of a
specialist engineering business and reduced management contracting.
Trading profits from property fell to Pounds 1.3m (Pounds 4.48m) from
turnover of Pounds 10.5m (Pounds 32.8m). Although the UK remained depressed,
the company's Spanish office developments performed well and three have been
pre-sold.
The housing division sold 235 units during the year, down from 280 in 1990,
and average prices declined more than 10 per cent to Pounds 100,000.
Provisions of Pounds 13.6m were made to cover falls in housing land values.
Following the provisions, average carrying values are at 20 per cent of unit
sale prices which should allow the company to maintain its gross margin.
Other provisions of Pounds 7.34m covered commercial property, redundancy
costs - staff numbers have been cut 35 per cent over the last 15 months, and
a loss on a contract for the US bank JP Morgan.
Extraordinary losses of Pounds 7.51m for closures and disposals took losses
attributable to shareholders to Pounds 19.7m. Combined with the dividend
charge, a Pounds 23.7m transfer from reserves was required.
COMMENT
Given the gloom from the construction leaders, Higgs and Hill's figures were
hardly surprising. Indeed, the shares gained 8p to 88p, partly on relief the
dividend was not cut further, and partly because the market appreciated the
thorough levels of provisions. But while taking the full hit may be in
vogue, predicting the company's recovery is more tricky. Its main
construction division cannot expect to avoid a further downturn in line with
the industry this year. Property also remains vulnerable in the UK and Higgs
and Hill's problem is that only one of its three businesses, housing, is an
early cycle recovery-play. Following the dividend cut, this year's pay-out
should total about 4.5p, suggesting a yield of 6.4 per cent. With forecast
profits of Pounds 2.5m this year, putting them on a multiple of 22, the
shares look fairly valued, even on net assets of close to 200p.

FT  16 APR 92 / Finding new routes to debt refunding: The way UK companies
are refinancing cheap loans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UK companies are now having to repay cheap debt finance raised from banks
and the bond market in the late 1980s.
Refinancing which has taken place so far suggests that corporate cash is
likely to come from greater range of sources, but at a higher price this
time around the economic cycle.
Companies have strengthened their balance sheets over the past two years,
repaying some debt either with fresh equity finance or out of cash flow.
The corporate sector financial deficit, the net increase in liabilities, in
1990 was 5 per cent of gross domestic product, or Pounds 5.23bn. By the end
of last year however, net company borrowing had been reduced to less than 2
per cent of GDP, or Pounds 2.48bn.
Some restructuring was achieved through the equity market last year, as
institutional investors moved money into shares ahead of an anticipated
economic recovery.
In all, UK companies raised Pounds 10bn from rights issues. Much of it was
used to repay outstanding debt.
However, many companies will still have to repay debts arranged in the late
1980s at very low rates. One source of cheap debt was the syndicated bank
loans market.
A favourite funding vehicle for company treasurers in the late 1980s was the
five-year multi-option facility (MOF), a type of flexible loan package
designed to provide the company with a core committed loan and an
uncommitted facility in which a large number of banks competed to
participate.
Competition among banks to participate drove the price of debt funding down
to extremely fine levels. For example, in May 1987 Booker, the food and
distribution group, signed a Pounds 135m five-year multiple option facility
with a group of banks led by Chase Investment Bank, at an interest rate of
just 0.0625 percentage points over the London interbank offered rate
(Libor).
This was not exceptional. Companies which signed five-year multi-option
facilities in the same year included Bowater, BTR, Burton, Crest Nicholson,
Dixons, Grand Metropolitan, Hillsdown Holdings, Queens Moat Houses,
Rolls-Royce, Saatchi &amp; Saatchi and Tesco. All gained access to funding at an
interest rate less than 0.15 percentage points over Libor.
Another source of cheap finance was convertible bond issues. By offering
conversion into equity at a time of rising share prices companies could
raise debt at very low interest rates, often around 4 per cent.
However, the share prices of many companies have performed badly since the
convertible bonds were issued and are unlikely to reach the conversion
price. Bond holders will not convert into equity. Instead, the debt will
have to be repaid.
Some companies have both MOFs and convertible bonds maturing. For example,
Hillsdown Holdings must deal with a Pounds 150m convertible bond issue by
December if its share price, which yesterday closed at 192p, does not reach
397p. The company also signed a Pounds 300m five-year MOF in December 1987,
at a cost of 0.10 percentage points over Libor.
It is clear that refinancing is not taking place through big syndicated
banking facilities. Company treasurers insist that complex loans such as
MOFs are dead.
Instead, companies are arranging credit lines with individual banks, valuing
committed funding from a smaller number of relationship banks.
For example, Grand Metropolitan last year arranged a Dollars 2.5bn (Pounds
1.41bn) loan with a group of 34 banks to refinance an existing loan from
more than 60 banks. Like many other companies over the last year, Grand Met
arranged the facility itself.
'We wanted to emphasise the relationship nature of the transaction by going
to the banks one-by-one and choosing the participants,' commented Mr Simon
Martin, assistant treasurer.
It is clear that the cost of bank finance has increased sharply since the
late 1980s. Grand Metropolitan raised new money last year at interest rates
up to 0.50 percentage points over Libor.
One reason for the increase in the cost of bank finance is the pull-back of
Japanese banks from the UK market, due in part to the falls on the Tokyo
stock market. Bankers estimate that Japanese banks accounted for 40 per cent
of the UK corporate loans market in the late 1980s, but only about 10 per
cent today.
With this in mind, companies are also looking to raise debt finance from
institutional investors, particularly in the US market. Bigger companies can
raise debt overseas from public bond issues. For example, Grand Metropolitan
last year raised Dollars 900m in the US public bond market.
'We are well aware of the capital constraints facing banks and were looking
to diversify our sources of funding,' said Mr Martin.
Smaller companies are placing debt securities privately with US
institutional investors. Foreign issuers - many of them British - raised
Dollars 22bn in the US private placement market last year.
Hillsdown is an example of a highly-geared company which spent the past two
years restructuring its balance sheet and lining up funding to repay cheap
debt raised in the late 1980s. The company raised Pounds 285m from a rights
issue in October last year; Pounds 100m was raised in July from debt
placement with with US institutional investors; bilateral loan facilities
have been put in place with relationship banks to cover maturing debt.
The company is also considering a 'club' loan on the model followed by Grand
Metropolitan last year, believing that better terms can be achieved from
relationship banks than large syndicated loans.
'We have already addressed the issue of refinancing. We can now deal with
the maturing MOF and the convertible bond issue within existing facilities,'
said Mr Nick Mariscotti, treasurer.

FT  16 APR 92 / Banks fail to woo Midland investors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN and DAVID BARCHARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INSTITUTIONAL investors in Midland Bank yesterday gave a chilly response to
a briefing for shareholders designed to build support for the bank's
acquisition by Hongkong and Shanghai Bank.
Shareholders said they were disturbed by the absence of specific figures on
cost savings from the merger, and the lack of detail on the Pounds 190m
charge intended to cover rationalisation costs.
In the joint briefing, Midland chairman Mr Brian Pearse, Mr John Gray,
deputy chairman of HSBC Holdings, Hongkong Bank's parent, and Mr Bernard
Asher, a director on both banks' boards, sought to persuade shareholders of
the advantages of the proposed Pounds 3.1bn takeover.
They emphasised the benefits for shareholders of owning a company likely to
gain from growing Asian trade with the west and the synergies to be created
by the takeover. Mr Pearse also told shareholders, without mentioning Lloyds
Bank by name, that monopolies officials would be likely to veto a takeover
between two UK banks and that such a takeover would be likely to produce
fewer cost savings than imagined.
However, institutions said that in addition to disappointment over the price
they are being offered for their shares, they were chary of the
multinational bank to be created by the takeover. They believe HSBC's desire
to acquire Midland reflects its fears about political stability of its home
market after 1997.
In the City, opinion was divided over whether fund managers would accept
HSBC's terms announced this week and over whether Lloyds Bank or another
bidder would make a rival bid.
'I think it is basically a done deal,' said Mr Mike Fesemeyer at Nomura
Research Institute.
There was thin trading in Midland shares in London, and the shares closed at
364p, down 1p on the day.
The Kuwait Investment Office again failed to find buyers for 60m Midland
shares placed on the market yesterday, though it is believed to have
received interest from buyers for about a third of the shares.
HSBC's shares rose HKDollars 1 to HKDollars 40.25 yesterday, increasing the
value of its all-paper bid by 7.7p to 385.7p per Midland share.

FT  16 APR 92 / Tarmac profits fall 90% to Pounds 21m after provisions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TARMAC, the UK's largest housebuilder, yesterday continued the string of
poor results from construction companies when it announced sharply lower
operating profits and large provisions. Pre-tax profits fell nearly 90 per
cent to Pounds 21m from Pounds 190.7m a year ago.
The company is recommending a cut in its final dividend to 2.5p from 8.25p
making uncovered total of 5.5p, less than half last time's 11.25p. The
shares fell 6p to 139p.
Mr Neville Simms, who took over as chief executive earlier this year, said
1992 was expected to remain difficult with interim profits well down on last
time's Pounds 18.2m. He said a key objective was to reduce debt, which
increased more than 10 per cent to Pounds 456.9m and took the company's
debt/equity ratio to 51 per cent if dollar denominated auction market
preferred stock was included as debt.
Tarmac wants to cut the ratio to about 25 per cent, suggesting more than
Pounds 200m in assets are up for sale. Disposals are likely in industrial
products, building products and in Tarmac America.
Over the past two years Tarmac cut its workforce 16 per cent, or more than
5,000 jobs. Rationalisation costs last year totalled Pounds 12.3m.
Turnover fell to Pounds 3.23bn from Pounds 3.61bn due to reduced volumes in
most businesses. The quarry products division was affected by price
competition, leading to reduced margins. Housing sales fell nearly 2,000
units to 9,327 in the UK, although average prices increased slightly to
Pounds 77,100.
Timing for upturn in the housing market remained uncertain, although Mr
Simms said Easter would provide a pointer to whether the election result had
improved consumer confidence.
Profits before exceptional items fell to Pounds 60m from Pounds 190.7m. The
company is making exceptional provisions of Pounds 45m including a Pounds
12m charge for its share of the Channel tunnel, and Pounds 10m to cover
falling land values. Sales of Eurotunnel warrants made an exceptional profit
of Pounds 6m.
Earnings fell to 0.2p from 16.7p. Profits attributable to shareholders fell
to Pounds 12.9m from Pounds 144.4m. Following the dividend charge, there was
a retained loss of Pounds 38.6m against Pounds 59.9m profit.

FT  16 APR 92 / Baltic Exchange may move headquarters to Billingsgate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD EVANS, RICHARD LAPPER and VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MEMBERS of the Baltic Exchange, which was badly damaged by last Friday's IRA
bomb in the City of London, hope to move into the renovated Billingsgate
fish market while their own listed building is being repaired.
Mr Peter Tudball, Baltic Exchange chairman, told a meeting of more than 700
members yesterday that the building would be saved, although repairs would
take at least three years. Costs should be covered by the building's Pounds
75m insurance.
The Exchange, which arranges most of the world's freight chartering and ship
sales, would like to make a temporary home at Billingsgate, which was
refurbished by Citicorp, the US bank, but never occupied. The alternative
would be for the 60 broking firms that were in the Baltic Exchange to remain
in their present temporary accommodation in the Lloyd's building and other
City offices.
More details on a possible deal with Citicorp, the leaseholder, are expected
to be available next week, and a further meeting of Baltic Exchange brokers
is planned for next Friday.
The Baltic Exchange building took the full force of the blast and it was
feared at first that it would have to be demolished. However, the basic
structure, the trading floor and the marble pillars withstood the blast
well.
Damage caused by the bomb has left Ecclesiastical Insurance, the specialist
church insurer, with one of its biggest losses. Damage to six churches
affected by the blast has been provisionally estimated at more than Pounds
2m.
The biggest claim in the company's history was caused by a fire at York
Minster in the mid-1980s which caused losses of more than Pounds 4m.
The churches affected by the bomb all suffered extensive damage, including
the destruction of ancient stained glass.
Meanwhile, loss assessors (acting on behalf of companies affected by the
explosion), and loss adjusters (acting for insurers), are continuing to
assess the full extent of the losses. Potential liabilities for lost rental
income from buildings damaged by the blast could be more than Pounds 100m.
Chartered surveyors believe that 15 buildings, with 1.3m sq ft of office
space, have been badly affected and will be vacant for several months.
Mr John Major told the cabinet yesterday of his concern that news coverage
of IRA attacks was concentrating on the impact to buildings rather than on
the personal tragedies involved.

FT  16 APR 92 / The Lex Column: Blue Circle
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The City used to be pretty sniffy about Blue Circle Industries, but
notwithstanding a 13p fall in the share price yesterday the company now
enjoys a sizeable fan club. If there is a problem, though, it is not in last
year's numbers, which were bang in line with expectations and contained
encouraging evidence that margins in the increasingly important home product
activities have generally held up. Nor should investors be unduly worried
about the widespread profit downgradings for the current year: these appear
to have been prompted mainly by news that under new accounting standards
profits on the disposal of a major Singapore property will not now be taken
above the line.
If there are worries, they stem in the short term from the twin price and
cost pressures on UK cement margins, and in the long term from nagging
doubts about BCI's real talent for home products. After all, it is hard to
deny that the company overpaid for its diversification, and that
shareholders' funds have been diminished by a string of balance sheet
write-downs.

FT  16 APR 92 / The Lex Column: Forte
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The market readily forgave Forte's 63 per cent fall in pre-tax profits at
the interim stage. The excuse was the Gulf war, and expectations were for
quick recovery. Now, after a 59 per cent fall in the second half, the market
is again in a forgiving mood. The grounds this time are the depth and
persistence of the UK recession which hit Forte's London hotel business hard
during the autumn. Perhaps investors would take a harsher view if the
company did not present a clean-cut image in an otherwise slightly racy
sector.
Unlike Ladbroke, Forte has no record of flattering its profit and loss
account with property disposals. Unlike Queens Moat, it has had no rights
issue since 1981. Moreover, Forte has coped sensibly with the recession,
cutting out Pounds 40m of fixed costs and aggressively marketing its
re-branded hotels in an apparently successful effort to raise market share.
Gearing may have risen from 36 to 44 per cent, but interest is still covered
1.7 times and the ratio is likely to improve this year.
At yesterday's close of 254p, however, the company is trading on a historic
multiple of 42, more than four times that of Queens Moat. This year's
multiple would still be over 20 if earnings doubled, which is stretching
things on both counts. Higher debt will add to the interest bill, at least
in the early part of the year. The tax charge, which last year included
Pounds 11m of unrelieved ACT, is likely to stay high. Provincial hotels
remain depressed. Business in London is not back to 1990 levels. In short,
Forte is still far from achieving occupancy levels that will permit it to
start jacking up rates. The recovery looks slow and the price expensive for
a company which, with luck, will only just be able to cover a held dividend
this year.

FT  16 APR 92 / The Lex Column: UK economy
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The continued exuberance of the London equity market can be put down to
several factors, one of them being the record-breaking performance of Wall
Street. Much the most important, though, is the belief that the UK consumer
has been unleashed by last week's election result. The latest survey from
the Confederation of British Industry certainly confirms that ahead of the
election, retail demand was knocked flat. In the survey period - from three
days after the budget to the day before the election - year-on-year retail
volume was down for the first time in eight months.
The timing of the survey means that retailers' expectations for this month
are of doubtful value, since if they believed the opinion polls they
presumably thought Labour would get in. Even so, most looked for a better if
still poor month, with the important caveat that the high level of stocks
meant that orders were likely to be flat. All in all, it still sounds as if
consumer confidence was on the mend even before the election result was
known.
The real problem will come in deciding how far a strong April is simply a
function of a weak March. In the month immediately after the Gulf war, the
official government figures showed non-food retail volume jumping 7 per
cent. Two months later it was back below where it started. While it is hard
to believe that will happen this time, the nagging thought remains that the
first normal month showing the underlying trend will be May. The official
May retail sales figure will not be out until early July. For a market

FT  16 APR 92 / The Lex Column: Tarmac on the deck
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Few UK companies have been humbled in this recession quite like Tarmac.
While others in the building and building materials sectors have managed to
restrict the damage to their balance sheets or their profit and loss
accounts, the 1980s wonder stock has been hit hard in the teeth on both.
Pre-tax profits of Pounds 21m last year were a mere 5 per cent of their 1988
peak, while the combination of higher net borrowings and a Pounds 230m drop
in shareholders' funds pushed end-1991 gearing beyond 50 per cent.
Bid speculation will doubtless linger in the market for a while. But it is
worth asking why Minorco, reputedly interested in Tarmac's aggregates
business, would want to take over the whole shebang; or indeed, why it would
be any better at sorting out the sorry mess than existing management. On the
basis of a ridiculous prospective earnings multiple and a yield adjacent to
Redland's, the shares at 139p are looking somewhat dear.
The grim reality is that Tarmac has been slow to spot its problems and is in
for a long, hard slog now that corrective action is finally under way. Its
plan to ease the financial pressure by selling peripheral assets - involving
perhaps Pounds 200m-Pounds 250m of disposals this year - is reminiscent of
Wimpey a year ago. Neither group has dared tap investors for more money, but
Wimpey at least had a couple of plums to put in the shop window. As for
housing, the company may yet be right to remain a volume player. But one
feels the decision is at least in part an unavoidable legacy of its more
glorious past. As last year's shrunken Pounds 40m of capital expenditure
demonstrates,it will be some time before Tarmac moves forward aggressively
on any front at all.

FT  16 APR 92 / Treasury given regulatory role: City faces uncertainty over
split of investment responsibilities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
REGULATORS and financial institutions in the City were braced for a period
of uncertainty yesterday as it was confirmed that responsibility for
investment regulation in the UK is to move to the Treasury from the
Department of Trade and Industry.
The overseeing of insurance companies is to remain with the DTI, in spite of
earlier indications that this would also move to the Treasury.
The division of responsibilities between the DTI and the Treasury has left
many in the City uncertain about their future relationship with government,
and prompted concern about the UK's ability to mount a unified front in
Brussels in negotiations over the financial sector.
The Association of British Insurers, the trade association of the UK's
powerful insurance industry, said there would have to be a clear demarcation
between the responsibilities of the two departments. It added that there was
a case for having only one government department sponsoring the financial
sector, rather than two.
The switch to the Treasury, foreshadowed in the Conservative party manifesto
ahead of last week's general election, will involve the 50-strong financial
services division moving from the DTI in a matter of weeks.
Responsibility for financial regulation at the Treasury will be taken on by
Mr Anthony Nelson, the newly appointed economic secretary. Mrs Rachel Lomax,
the Treasury's highly respected deputy chief economic adviser, will move
next week to become the senior civil servant responsible for the area, which
includes the Treasury's existing financial institutions and markets group.
The reorganisation will allow the Treasury to speak on behalf of the UK in
international discussions on financial regulation, mirroring the involvement
of finance ministries in most other developed countries. It also reflects a
desire to bring the supervision of financial conglomerates increasingly
under one roof, the Treasury said.
The division of responsibilities, though, means the DTI will retain overall
responsibility for insurance companies, while the Treasury will take on
responsibility for supervising their marketing operations.
It will also leave the Stock Exchange reporting to the DTI for some
purposes, including its responsibility for overseeing listings under
European law, and the Treasury for others, such as its activities as a
Recognised Investment Exchange. What happens to other activities, such as
Taurus, its planned paperless trading system, remains unclear.
The exchange yesterday said it had been given no indication of how the
division of responsibilities would settle down.
In a further division, the Treasury will have to agree an overhaul of retail
investment regulation planned by the Securities and Investments Board, the
chief investment regulator. But the DTI, which oversees competition policy,
will have to clear these changes on competition grounds.

FT  16 APR 92 / Champagne nettled by Britain's small beer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FRANCE'S fiercely protective champagne producers yesterday blocked an
assault on the integrity of their famous name by an Olde English cordial
marketed as 'elderflower champagne'.
Justice Robert Reid ruled in the High Court in London that the Surrey-based
soft drink maker should print no more labels that included the word
'champagne', pending final resolution of a complaint from Taittinger,
champagne maker, and the French industry.
Mr Guy Woodall, an owner of the Thorncroft Vineyard partnership that
distributes the drink, said he was confident the French would lose their
case which claims he is damaging the region's famous reputation.
'We think it wrong that a perfectly well-known name should be legislated out
of the English language because of the monopolistic interests of French wine
growers,' Mr Woodall said.
He said elderflower champagne and other traditional 'small beers', such as
barley water and ginger ale, have been around since the Middle Ages, when
people tried to avoid contamination by boiling water, flavouring it with
herbs, dandelions or nettles, and fermenting it lightly.
Mr Woodall said he had taken an old recipe for elderflower champagne,
removed the alcohol and used carbonated water.
The controversy began last November, when the drink began to be sold in
bottles with wired champagne-style corks.
The drink is mainly sold through health food shops, and has a reputation for
'clearing the system' and warding off flu.
But with sales of only 100,000 bottles since November, it is hardly a threat
to the grandes marques champagne houses from the exclusive 85,000 acre
region north-east of Paris, which has been producing champagne since Roman
times.
The champagne industry, however, jealously guards its name. It has
successfully prevented a company on Spain's Costa Brava from passing off its
sparkling wine as champagne, and Babycham no longer uses the term 'the
champagne perry' for its pear-based drink.
From 1993 the EC is banning the description of methode champenoise on all
but labels of champagne. The French have not, however, managed to extend
their influence to North America where New York and Canadian 'champagnes'
are available.

The fuss surrounding London's bomb-devastated Baltic Exchange and its
Chamber of Shipping neighbour is all very commendable except for one small
point. Both establishments are a hangover from when Britain ruled the waves,
and such palatial premises are now far from ideal.
Indeed, the bombing has helped solve a difficult problem of what to do with
growing numbers of empty offices. The Baltic, like the Stock Exchange, no
longer needs a trading floor. A telephone and computer are all that's
needed.
If David Mellor, the new heritage minister, can be conned into paying for
the Baltic's restoration, all well and good. But with Pounds 75m of
insurance cover, its members are in the lucky position of being able to shop
around a bombed-out property market.
Citicorp's expensively refurbished Billingsgate fish market already has the
edge over the Royal Exchange and the Corn Exchange as the Baltic's new home.
The reason is that it has a bar.
'Wherever we go has to have one', says Baltic chairman Peter Tudball. 'It's
the way business has always been done,' he adds.

FT  16 APR 92 / Observer: Passing the bok
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Is it a flower, an animal, or an apartheid symbol? South Africans still
can't make up their mind whether their national sporting emblem should be a
springbok, a zebra or something beautiful, natural and neutral, like a
flower.
As the Olympic Games approach, the debate over the future of the springbok -
South Africa's traditional sporting symbol - is intensifying. In terms of
emotion, it ranks on a par with the question of what flag, if any, South
Africa should hoist at the Barcelona games.
The ANC-aligned National and Olympic Sports Congress (NOSC) has ruled that
the springbok is an apartheid symbol, and therefore causes considerable bad
feeling among blacks. It wants it replaced by the protea (the national
flower) and has produced six good reasons why. For example, a flower removes
the notion that sport is predominantly a male domain, and it is 'relevant to
the green issues'.
Not long ago the zebra looked like overtaking the springbok. Indeed, it was
the nickname given to South Africa's cricket team in the recent world cup.
One serious politician said that the black and white stripes on its skin
were appropriate given the country's racially diverse population.
Nevertheless, the ostrich also has its supporters on account of the
head-in-the-sand political and economic views of many in the population.
But does the NOSC have the authority to kill off the springbok? Sam Ramsamy,
head of the National Olympic Committee of South Africa, insists the decision
would be taken by his organisation; NOSC is but one affiliate. An added
complication is that springbok sports, like cricket and rugby, are not
Olympic sports. Hence their organisers could dispute the jurisdiction of
these bodies.

Union Carbide's decision to sell its Indian subsidiary is a glum footnote to
the 1984 poison gas disaster at its Bhopal plant, which killed 4,000 and
injured 200,000 more.
According to the unofficial Union Carbide version, it was the company's urge
to keep control of its Indian business which contributed to the disaster in
the first place.
Back in the 1970s, when the Indian government decided to make multinationals
relinquish majority control of Indian subsidiaries, most companies knuckled
under. Others, such as IBM and Coca-Cola, pulled out entirely. Union Carbide
did a deal. In return for keeping 51 per cent of the subsidiary, it agreed
to build the Bhopal plant.
The attraction for the Indians was that the factory produced a pesticide
which generated export earnings. The drawback for Union Carbide was that the
pesticide, Sevin, was too out-of-date to make much cash. How far the plant
was then allowed to deteriorate is still hotly disputed.
Union Carbide now proposes to put Dollars 17m of the sale money into a
Bhopal hospital trust, raising its compensation payments to nearly Dollars
500m.
But the affair does not rest there. Three weeks ago, the Indian government
renewed its attempts to have Warren Anderson, 70-year-old ex-head of the
company, extradited from the US on a charge of criminal negligence.

FT  16 APR 92 / Leading Article: A window for rate cuts
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
AFTER months of pre-election tension, the City has finally relaxed. The
markets have reacted with great enthusiasm to the prospect of five years of
stable Conservative government committed to low inflation and no
devaluation. But this surge of confidence will only persist if the economic
recovery starts soon; and the main obstacle to growth remains high interest
rates. Some City folk are encouraging the government to postpone interest
rate cuts and instead move quickly to narrow bands within the European
exchange rate mechanism. It is a temptation that Mr Lamont should resist.
Economic recovery, long predicted by the Treasury and like-minded City
analysts, may at last be in the pipeline; but their recent record does not
inspire confidence. The economy may experience a post-election boomlet over
the next few months, as companies and consumers make purchases they were
postponing. But timing-related blips in retail sales figures can send
misleading signals, as the chancellor learned last summer.
The risk remains that the recession will give-way to a prolonged period of
slow growth. The combination of high real interest rates and heavy consumer
and business debts do not together make a stable platform on which to build
a recovery driven only by rising real incomes for those in work. Rising
unemployment is also likely to keep southern consumers nervous for some
months yet.
Obstacle removed
The election result has removed one political obstacle to interest rate
cuts, namely the risk that they would have to be reversed if sterling
slipped to its ERM floor. Indeed, the post-election market rally appears to
have made this risk even more remote. Sterling has already climbed to well
within 2 1/2 per cent of its central rate. But it makes no sense for the
Treasury to wait for sterling to rise above its central rate before cutting
rates.
High German interest rates are the main obstacle to looser UK monetary
policy. UK short-term rates are a mere  3/4 of a percentage point above
German rates. No ERM member country has yet managed to maintain lower rates
than those of Germany for any length of time. A new government, however
large its majority and conservative its rhetoric, is not in a strong
position to test the market's patience.
Yet the government's hands are not completely tied. It can and should narrow
this interest rate differential further, perhaps by just a quarter of a
point at a time. The markets, and the public, must become used to the idea
that the ERM means frequent small changes in interest rates, and not always
downwards.
Attractive symbolism
The government should also resist a move to narrow bands within the ERM,
however attractive the symbolism of doing so during the UK's forthcoming
presidency of the European Community. The UK may have little room for
independent monetary policy manoeuvre in the ERM; but the Treasury and the
Bank of England should cling on to what flexibility they do possess, both
over when to move to narrow bands and around what rate.
Indeed, wide bands may give the UK a better chance than other ERM members of
pushing interest rates below those in Germany. A country can only do so if
its currency is expected to appreciate against the D-Mark. But the UK's wide
bands make the room for appreciation much greater. Success would be more
likely if the Bank of England were first made operationally independent of
Treasury control. That would be the clearest possible signal that the UK is
committed to low and stable inflation.
Even then, a substantial easing of UK monetary policy will not be
forthcoming until the Bundesbank cuts interest rates, a prospect which
Germany's fiscal crisis continues to postpone. Strains in the ERM would
quickly ease if economic growth in the UK and France picks up soon. But the
longer these countries have to endure slow growth and rising unemployment,
the greater the risk that monetary co-operation in Europe will disintegrate.
The rest of Europe badly needs Germany to put its house in order, but will
not be able to wait for ever. Until German rates do fall, the UK government
should take what opportunities it can to cut interest rates.

STOP] OR MY MOM WILL SHOOT (PG)
Empire
Orson Welles, summoned to Hollywood to make Citizen Kane, called cinema and
its paraphernalia the 'greatest train set a boy ever had.' Cue the greatest
love affair the cinema ever had.
Before and after Welles's dictum, the 'rolling stock' of film through a
camera or projector found a poetic rhyme in the rolling stock of trains
trundling through exotic landscapes. There is a rhyme too in the very
experience of filmgoing. Out there through the train window (the movie
screen) unfolds the changing world. In here in the well-upholstered carriage
(the auditorium), we the audience sit serene, attentive and invulnerable.
Lars Von Trier's Europa, a train movie that would have thrilled Welles, is a
mad, mad, mad, mad box of tricks. Into Germany at the end of World War 2
comes a gauche bespectacled young American (Jean-Marc Barr) hoping do his
bit for the Marshall Plan. With his railway superintendent uncle's
encouragement he will become a train guard and help to re-knit the damaged
arteries of a defeated land.
But he reckons without the 'Werewolves': Nazi-sympathising terrorists who
plant bombs and recruit pretty women like Barr's new girlfriend Barbara
Sukowa. And he reckons without the sinister liaisons between guilty ex-Nazis
like Sukowa's railway tycoon father and carpetbagging American officers like
General Eddie Constantine. This veteran Franco-Yank actor, who looks more
weirdly majestic with each movie, now resembles a bullfrog seen through a
magnifying glass.
The third thing the hero and we reckon without is the blizzard of visual and
dramatic effects director Von Trier hurls at us. The movie is in
black-and-white and colour, often at the same time. The camera passes
through walls, descends through solid floors or moves from a house into a
train with no visible 'cuts'. Multiple back-projection creates a 3D-like
'layering' of scenes. And the film abounds in gloriously clever ellipses
like the shot in which Barr and Sukowa, romancing on a midnight bridge, turn
to the sky and water behind them, which then 'dissolve' into the giant face
of the priest officiating at their marriage.
Is it all just fun and flamboyance? The Dane Von Trier, who won a Jury Prize
last year at Cannes and whose first film The Element Of Crime was a
delicious Borgesian bagatelle, has enough fresh stylistic ideas to keep
European cinema going until the next ice age. But Europa is also a cunningly
crafted parable about Europe Now disguised as Europe Then. The broken
boundaries and human flux in 1945 are much the same as those in 1992; only
the historical crisis has changed.
As Babel-like tongues battle to be heard on the building site of a new
continent, Europa's gaggle of French, German and American actors for once
vindicates Euro-pudding casting. Cultural confusion is the point in this
film. And the gathering of the plot-threads into a trainbound climax, as
clocks and bombs tick towards Judgment Day, makes not just for a satisfying
thriller but also for an emblematic image of historical countdown.
Trundling on rails of genius through stations of moviegoing bliss, Europa is
in all senses - all good senses - the sleeper of the year.
* * * The Euro-pudding problems solved by Europa are more obdurate in
Voyager. German director Volker Schlondorff, adapting Max Frisch's novel
Homo Faber, appoints an American hero (Sam Shepard) and looses him across
the globe with a mid-life crisis, a French girlfriend (Julie Delpy) and
memories of a German-Jewish old flame (Barbara Sukowa) now living in Greece.
Before the pudding is fully set alight, a flags-of-all-nations supporting
cast is stuck into it. As a result, the deliriously itinerant story - which
includes an ocean voyage, a trans-Europe car journey and a plane crash -
finds a storm of subtitles or foreign accents in every port.
But then what would you expect from a director whose agent must have a
sideline as a travel agent? Since winning native German acclaim for The Tin
Drum, Schlondorff's films have been made in Beirut (Circle Of Deceit), Paris
(Swann In Love) and New York (Death Of A Salesman). Somehow Voyager still
has an intermittent wit and power. Perhaps it is the ironic awareness of
rootlessness in the title and the sly jokes about a planet colonised by the
transport industry. (The air stewardesses still announce 'Tonight's meal is.
. .' when their passengers are squatting in the desert around a shattered
fuselage.) Or perhaps it is Mr Shepard, harmonising diverse locales with the
laconic, iconic grandeur he brought to The Right Stuff.
Indeed if you can take the warring-tongues dramatis personae and the dotty
ending - snake bites and dynastic revelations worthy of Aeschylus - Voyager
is oddly likable. In Columbus year it reminds us that when man discovered
the world was round, he also discovered that human problems are shared and
circular in whatever place and with whatever accent they are found.
Final Analysis, starring Richard Gere and Kim Basinger, is a mystery
thriller. The thriller part is about a psychoanalyst who falls for a
beautiful murdereress. The mystery is why it ambles on for two hours without
once raising the hairs on our spines.
We are in a moody, glossy San Francisco designed by Dean Tavoularis of The
Godfather and photographed by Jorden Cronenweth of Blade Runner. Every plot
device you can think of is lobbed at us by director Phil Joanou (State Of
Grace) and writer Wesley Strick (Cape Fear): courtroom scenes, two sexy
sisters sobbing on the shrink's shoulders (Basinger's sibling is Uma
Thurman) and a climax atop a sinister lighthouse stylishly mocked up by Mr
Tavoularis near the Golden Gate Bridge.
Yet almost none of the film works. Partly because Basinger's femme fatale is
about as interesting as a stocking advertisement come to life. Mainly
because there are so many tic-like nods to other movies - Saboteur, Vertigo,
Jagged Edge - that the film resembles an overanxious chicken browsing around
the filmic farmyard shortly before being taken off to get the chop.
Speaking of which, was it not Charles I who walked and talked two hours
after he was beheaded? This is not a historical fact, I know, but a
schoolboy solecism. But I recalled it during Percy Adlon's Salmonberries: a
strange Sapphic romance between a chattery dyed-blonde German emigrant
(Rosel Zech) and a taciturn androgynous Eskimo (kd lang). It takes place in
Alaska, with a short trip to Zech's Berlin, where she re-traces her
husband's death in a wartime shooting.
The tableau-vivant style of Adlon's Sugarbabies and Bagdad Cafe is here
married to a travelogue lyricism. The Alaskan snowscapes are gorgeous:
wall-to-wall Melvillean whiteness tinged with sunset pinks and scored for
distant wolf howls. And Miss lang, a Canadian singer-songwriter in love with
lower-case lettering, is an iconic contrast to Zech's peroxide excitability.
But eventually we ask, Where is it all going? And the answer returns,
Nowhere. It walks and talks. It even enjoys the scenery. Yet two hours later
it is as inert and silenced as the late King Charles.
Stop] Or My Mom Will Shoot, a 'comedy' directed by Roger Spottiswoode of
Turner And Hooch, is a piece of germ warfare from Hollywood designed to
empty or quarantine British cinemas over Easter. Sylvester Stallone is the
LA cop who needs a new partner, Estelle (Golden Girls) Getty as his Mom
accidentally becomes that new partner. Ho ho. Lots of chases, pratfalls and
senior citizen gags. I laughed once, when I remembered a good joke from
another, similar and better film.

The 1992 British general election serves as a healthy reminder that
communications is more black art than well-crafted logic.
The Liberal-Democrats had almost as much free media coverage as the two
leading parties. They came a poor third. Labour (once more) was widely
tipped to scoop the Oscars, thanks to positive advertising and consistent
design. It did worse than most observers expected.
The victorious Tories were widely accused of being lacklustre and
unimaginative, using negative images - tax bombshells and ball-and-chains -
shifting at the last minute to an upbeat promotion of a smiling John Major.
Any post-mortem should take note of the parties' relative promotional
spending. But according to the Conservative communications team, they spent
just Pounds 3m on all communications (including press advertising, posters
and election broadcasts) - less than a third spent in the 1987 election.
At the start of the 1992 campaign, Central Office officials hinted that they
had a Pounds 20m fighting fund; that now appears to be a tactically placed
exaggeration.
According to Concord Posterlink, a specialist outdoor buying agency,
political posters accounted for 17 per cent of the Pounds 2.7m roadside
advertising spend during the four weeks' of the election.
The Conservatives' took a 56 per cent share, against 28 per cent for Labour
and 6.5 per cent for the Lib-Dems. Labour spent an estimated Pounds 1 1/2 m
on press advertising; the Conservatives claim to have used just Pounds 1m.
In any case, cash is not everything; Haagen-Dazs ice cream (owned by Grand
Metropolitan), was launched mid-1991 on an advertising budget of just Pounds
300,000. It now has a 20 per cent share of the UK dairy ice-cream sector,
selling more than twice its two nearest competitors combined.
If marketing style meant victory, then Labour's final campaign rally in
Sheffield - all glitz and glamour - should have clinched things.
But for some of the Labour's communications team, the election result was a
shock, though perhaps not altogether a surprise. The team of 25 came from
two main sources; unpaid volunteers working after-hours from the agency BMP
DDB Needham - led by Chris Powell, 25 years a Labour party member - and from
Philip Gould Associates.
Labour's team held daily 'quality research' sessions with groups of some 10
undecided voters. According to one senior member, that research indicated
that the 'undecideds' were 'greater in number than usual and were Tory in
their values - that was consistently the case throughout the campaign'.
On one issue Labour and Conservative communications people agree - Labour
was sunk by tax. 'It was clearly a mistake for Labour to have tried to fight
a campaign by promising tax increases; that saddled the marketing of the
campaign with an uphill task,' said one of the shadow communications staff.
Shaun Woodward, the Conservative director of communications, agrees. 'The
shadow budget was a gift for us'.
One key member of Labour's advertising team believes that the Tories' 'Tax
Bombshell' image was effective. 'The message got home. But to attribute the
success of an election to an advertising agency would be ludicrous.'
The tax bombshell, like most of the Conservative images during the campaign,
gets no prizes for subtlety. But Woodward says 'the role of advertising is
over-emphasised - you win elections because people think you have got the
right policies. Labour lost because they allowed the backroom boys to take
over from the politicians.'
David Hill, Labour's communications director, blames a vituperatively
anti-Labour tabloid press. But he agrees that the party under-estimated the
electorate's mistrust of Labour and failed to grasp how far 'Thatcherite
individualism' has seeped into mass sentiment.
Bill Muirhead, chairman of Saatchi &amp; Saatchi and one of the leading figures
of the Conservatives' advertising team, says: 'We weren't swayed by adverse
media opinion. We had pinned to the office wall a large notice which read:
'Hold fast to the basic idea. Do not give in to the pressures of the
moment.''
Knight Ritchie, the Liberal-Democrat's agency, adds: 'Why should we think
that advertising should be that influential?'
However, one thing is emerging from the inquest, which is, as Woodward puts
it: 'You start fighting the next election the day after winning the last
one.'

FT  16 APR 92 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): When fact and
forecast are polls apart - Guy de Jonquieres says that far more than the
professional pride of Britain's psephologists has been dented by the poor
showing of their predictions in the general election
</HEADLINE>

Market research specialists have long had an advantage over ordinary
businessmen. While other executives relied on logic, experience or plain
intuition, market researchers could claim they had science and the numbers
on their side.
Until last Thursday, that is, when Britain's general election result
confounded the pollsters' findings. Though political polls are a sideline
for the agencies which conduct them - done as much for publicity as for
profit - many in market research fear the consequences could be
far-reaching.
'There is a grave danger that the whole profession will be called into
disrepute,' says Lynne Todd, market information and development manager at
Cadbury, Britain's biggest confectionery maker.
The Market Research Society, the industry's professional body, evidently
shares her concern: it has launched a crash inquiry into what went wrong.
Far more than professional pride is involved. Britain's market research
industry is among the biggest in Europe, valued at Pounds 425m a year.
Just over half of that is accounted for by about 400 market research
agencies, which sell their services to corporate and government customers,
and the rest by the latters' in-house experts.
The industry fears that business may now be harder to come by. No desertions
have been reported yet, but some corporate users of market research say last
Thursday's debacle has raised doubts about its value.
'We learned long ago to be sceptical when our marketing people say we must
launch a product because surveys show consumers would love it,' says the
head of a leading UK drinks company. 'We shall be even more sceptical in
future.'
Ivor Crewe, professor of government at Essex University and a leading
psephologist, thinks the pollsters have good reason to be worried.
He says they have deliberately turned political polls into an advertisement
for their research skills and the benchmark by which they are measured.
'There are very few other occasions when a relatively objective test is
available. If market research tells a toothpaste manufacturer that 50 per
cent of people prefer green stripes and 30 per cent red stripes, how can the
company know if it is true?' he says.
Some in the firing line are looking for ways to spread the blame. Bob
Worcester, chairman of Mori, whose frequent television appearances have made
him Britain's best-known pollster, accuses the media - particularly the
broadcasters - of misrepresenting poll findings.
'I've said on virtually every occasion that polls are a snapshot of opinion
 -they don't predict,' he says.
'There is no case other than a British general election when we are expected
to predict the future and to do so within a decimal point. Only the media
expect this.'
But other experts think such arguments are a cop-out. Lynne Todd of Cadbury
says that after years of working with the media, pollsters should be well
aware how their work is presented.
Crewe points out that all political pollsters present their eve-of-election
findings as forecasts of the outcome and that Worcester has boasted of the
accuracy of the opinion polls in foreshadowing past election results. 'Bob
really is trying to have it both ways,' says Crewe.
Nonetheless, there is widespread agreement that the techniques and use of
market research differ between political and business applications. Few, if
any, large companies rely on it for forecasting.
'We use it to find out the needs of our customers, what's on their minds,'
says Barry Hill, marketing vice-president at American Express. 'We would
never ask it to predict whether a particular product would be a success.'
Headline statistics and margins of error are also far less critical for
business users, many of whom are more interested in longer-run trends. 'It
very rarely happens that if the result of a survey is 54 per cent we do one
thing, but if it's 55 per cent, we do another,' says Alan Ellerton, market
planning manager at the Argos retail chain.
Furthermore, though many large companies put much effort into analysing
market research findings, none would base an important decision on them.
'Market research is an aid to judgment, not a replacement,' says Bill Young,
marketing director of Lever Brothers, the detergents company.
Often, he says, more valuable insights can be gained by assessing a new
product's performance on foreign markets, studying broader consumer trends,
or simply strolling around a supermarket.
Young says that some Lever Brothers' products have succeeded even though
market research pointed to a poor response.
Experts also say opinion surveys for businesses are more tightly structured
than political polls, defining target groups, allowing for regional
variations, filtering out misleading responses and double-checking results.
Sue Stossel, director of the Market Research Society, says this is partly
because most business users know precisely which markets they are interested
in, while political polls 'are looking at anyone who's got a vote'.
But she concedes that cost is also an important factor.
Nigel Jacklin of RSL, which carries out the National Readership Survey, says
this project involves far more time and money than any market research
agency can afford to spend on election polling. Only by joining forces could
the political pollsters command resources on that scale.
That is an option they may need to consider if they hope to be taken
seriously at the next general election.
However, judging by the tremors of anxiety coursing through the market
research industry, it must act well before then to reassure the business
customers on which it depends for its bread and butter.

FT  16 APR 92 / Technology: The art of perfection - Steven Butler explains
how a single speck of dust creates havoc with the way liquid crystal
displays are made
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVEN BUTLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEC, the Japanese electronics company, late last year surprised the
electronics industry when it made the almost unbelievable claim that 50 per
cent of the colour liquid displays coming off its production line were
meeting quality control standards. Fifty per cent yields would be an
embarrassment for almost any other industry, especially in Japan where
companies pride themselves on rigorous quality control.
But the thin film transistor (TFT) technology used for the colour screens -
in which each of the million or so cells, or pixels, that make up a display
panel is charged by an individual transistor - was just too complicated.
Manufacturers were having to junk more than 80 per cent of everything
produced because of blotches on the screens caused by dust. One transistor
out of a million, short circuited by a single microscopic speck of dust, was
enough to doom a panel.
Progress in the past year by NEC and other companies, however, has raised
the prospect that colour LCD screens used for computers and portable
televisions may soon be cheap enough to be widely affordable.
Shigehiko Satoh, engineering manager at NEC's liquid crystal display factory
in Izumi, on Japan's Kyushu Island, will not name a precise yield figure
today, but he says it is well over 50 per cent, and on the way to reaching
80 per cent in the near term. 'Each month the production yield is rising,'
he says.
NEC is shipping more than 10,000 10-inch panels a month and is hoping to cut
the price from nearly Y600,000 today to Y60,000 in just three years.
The race for the market has entered full swing. The main stumbling block is
no longer how to design screens, but how to make an amazingly complex and
delicate device at a price that will allow a mass market to take shape.
The high cost of TFT panels begins with the glass, which must be sodium
free, absolutely flat and uniform in thickness. Until recently only Corning,
of the US, was able to supply glass of sufficiently high tolerance. NEC has
begun to make some glass, and Hoya, another Japanese optical glass company,
has products under development.
Atop the glass goes seven layers of various chemicals which act as
conductors and insulators, and which are etched with intricate circuitry to
carry electronic messages to each of up to 1.3m pixels. The layers must be
deposited with absolute uniformity, and an entire panel can be destroyed by
a single, microscopic bit of dust. These layers, including colour filters
and transistors, are sandwiched between sheets of glass 6 microns, or 6
millionths of a metre, apart - but the tolerance for spacing errors is only
0.02 microns across the entire 10-inch surface.
The manufacturing difficulties and the procedures resemble those for
semiconductors. The difference is that while a flaw on a silicon wafer may
cause failure of one of several hundred chips processed at the same time, a
single flaw on an LCD screen destroys an entire panel by shorting the
circuits and producing blotches on the screen.
Many of the precise technologies by which Satoh has lifted yields at NEC
remain secret, and the secrecy that shrouds other manufacturers operations
makes it impossible to say how much of a lead, if any, NEC has achieved. At
Display Technologies, an IBM-Toshiba joint venture, yields have been raised
from a miserable 8 per cent in the first month of production last September
to about 40 per cent today. Yet it is plain that NEC's success owes less to
any single trick than it does to persistent attention to the intricate
details of a complex process.
Each piece of glass, each worker, and each machine are bar coded and
constantly monitored by computer. When a semi-finished panel emerges from
the first, most sensitive processes involving chemical deposition and
etching, it is tested. Precisely how this is done, even before driving
circuitry is attached, NEC will not say. But it means that the computer can
ferret out any abnormalities in the process, and statistically trace any
offending machine, employee or material.
It also saves NEC from proceeding needlessly with the difficult process of
attaching driving circuits - the wire leads by which the panel can be
attached to other electronic equipment - to a faulty screen.
Engineers from equipment manufacturers have spent months at the plant trying
to understand why one machine should achieve higher yields than another.
Days are spent monitoring the movements of individuals, to try to understand
why two different workers on the same machine should achieve such different
results. Satoh now hopes his employees do not sit down, because this simple
movement releases a cloud of invisible particles that can destroy thousands
of dollars of products.
NEC engineers at Izumi are now locked in debate. A building has been razed
next to the Izumi factory, and Y30bn has been budgeted to build a new colour
LCD plant that will produce 12- and 14-inch screens beginning next year.
Yet Masamichi Shiraishi, president of NEC Kagoshima (the local subsidiary)
has asked Satoh to achieve 100 per cent yields in the new plant, a target
that Satoh believes is probably impossible. Even to come close to the target
will demand complete rethinking of the production process and total
automation. This would eliminate the biggest source of contamination - human
intervention.
Yet to reorganise from top to bottom a complex production process that has
been demonstrably successful involves big risks. Most of the machines that
Satoh and suppliers like Nikon and Anelva have worked so hard to fine tune
will probably have to be scrapped.
Rather than think of the process as a series of discrete operations
performed sequentially, engineers would have have to devise an integrated
process from scratch. The risks would plainly be great, but given the rapid
growth in demand for LCD devices, so too would be the rewards.
A previous article on liquid crystal displays appeared on Tuesday.

FT  16 APR 92 / Technology: Bright ideas play a game of chance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
This is the saga of an invention made 10 years ago in a medium-sized UK
metals company, sold on to a group of a investors in California, taken up
for a while by an international chemicals group - and now brought back to
the UK through venture capital funding.
The invention, Ebonex, is a black ceramic material that should have a vast
range of electrochemical applications, from batteries to biological
implants. It conducts electricity well and is chemically stable and
non-toxic.
Ebonex may at last be on the brink of profitable exploitation. Its story so
far illustrates the way in which the different attitudes of large and small
companies, investors, lawyers and regulators can facilitate or frustrate the
commercialisation of intellectual property.
Peter Hayfield, a scientist working at IMI, discovered the properties that
make Ebonex (a suboxide of titanium) such an excellent material for
electrodes. The first applica-tion he had in mind was to heat large
quantities of custard in institutional kitchens, by passing an electric
current through the custard between Ebonex electrodes.
Some IMI managers wanted to develop Ebonex within the company but the board
decided that, as a metals manufacturer, it should not devote resources to
developing a ceramic. So IMI sold the patent rights to a group of 75
investors in California who set up a new company, Ebonex Technologies Inc
(ETI), to exploit the material.
The Californian group found it difficult to raise the full purchase price
and brought in ICI, the UK-based chemicals group, as a partner at the end of
1986. ETI generated considerable interest in Ebonex during the following
three years.
However, the first application planned for Ebonex - chlorine generation for
swimming pools - was not a commercial success, and the company could not
develop any other revenue-earning applications before reaching the limit of
capital investment ICI had set for it.
So in 1990 ETI went out to raise investment from new sources. It negotiated
with several companies that were interested in buying Ebonex technology,
including Heraeus, a German materials group.
The ETI board came close to agreeing a deal with Ampersand, a US venture
capital group, but agreed to give the management team, headed by Robert
Clarke, time to put together a counter offer which would bring Ebonex back
to the UK. Clarke was keen to exploit Britain's low manufacturing costs and
strong technical skills.
Venture capitalists like to say how important personal contacts are in their
business. But these had nothing to do with the way ETI and its UK venture
partner, Korda &amp; Company, got together. Clarke simply got Korda's name from
the British Venture Capital Association directory and made a 'cold call' to
Korda's London office last July.
The ETI team liked Korda's flexibility and willingness to accept risk. 'Some
of the other people I saw had an overriding fear of failure,' says Clarke.
Korda was sufficiently excited by the innovative nature
potential of Ebonex to grapple with the complexities of seeking consent for
the financial restructuring from 75 individual Californian investors, as
well as ICI and a very demanding state Department of Corporations. Six
months of legal negotiations in California reinforced the view of Carolyn
Hayman, Korda's joint managing director, that the US legal culture is 'a
significant obstacle in building constructive business relationships'.
The legal fees ran over the Dollars 50,000 set aside for them, but
eventually last February the deal was completed. ETI has emerged with a new
name, Atraverda, and an initial Pounds 250,000 investment by Korda for 30
per cent of the business. Hayman expects to invest at least Pounds 750,000
more in the near future.
The challenges now include: bringing in revenues rapidly from selected
electrochemical applications of Ebonex; securing immediate supplies of the
material from a subcontract manufacturer in the US while setting up in-house
production facilities; strengthening patent protection; and identifying the
most promising future applications.

FT  16 APR 92 / Lloyd Webber pays Pounds 10.12m for Canaletto: Saleroom
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ANDREW Lloyd Webber, the composer who threatened to leave the UK if Labour
won the general election, yesterday celebrated the Conservative victory by
paying Pounds 10.12m at Christie's for Canaletto's 'The Old Horse Guards,
London'.
The view of St James's Park was painted in 1749 just before the present
Horse Guards in Whitehall was erected.
Along with Mr Charles Saatchi, who buys contemporary art, Mr Lloyd Webber is
the UK's leading collector of works of art. His main area of interest is
pre-Raphaelite and Victorian paintings but, through dealer Mr David Mason,
he has recently bought extensively into ceramics.
He decided to bid for the Canaletto on Wednesday morning and secured it for
about Pounds 2m less than his upper limit.
The Canaletto, a large work in excellent condition, has been in the Harris
family since the mid 18th century. There were fears that the painting would
be sold to a foreign buyer and the Tate Gallery in London was keen to
acquire it for the nation before the auction, but no deal could be arranged.
Mr Lloyd Webber's successful intervention keeps the Canaletto in the UK and
ensures that it will periodically be put on public display.
The price was higher than the Christie's forecast and establishes a record
for the artist and for any Old Master sold in the UK, beating the Pounds
8.1m paid for Mantegna's 'Adoration of the Magi' at Christie's in 1985.
The Canaletto sale distracted attention from Christie's failure to sell the
other leading painting in the auction, Rembrandt's 'Daniel and Cyrus Before
the Idol of Bel'.
This was unsold when the bidding stopped at Pounds 5.8m, but is close enough
to the reserve price for Christie's to hope for a private deal in the next
few days.
The Old Master auction totalled Pounds 13.654m, but was 40 per cent unsold
by value. Demand was patchy, although a portrait of a young girl by Lucas
Cranach sold well at Pounds 506,000 and a self-portrait by Salvator Rosa
also beat its estimate at Pounds 440,000.

FT  16 APR 92 / Figures draw veil over jobless women: Why official
unemployment statistics may not give a complete picture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MRS Gillian Shephard, the first Conservative woman employment secretary, and
the first with a specific brief for women, will today announce unemployment
figures which may underestimate female unemployment by up to 250,000.
Government figures for February showed that 12.8 per cent of the male
workforce was unemployed, compared with 5.3 per cent for women.
The figures classify as unemployed only those who can claim benefit, and
exclude many women who are jobless and available for work. The Unemployment
Unit, a pressure group for the unemployed, said many women immediately
disappeared from the count when the definition was changed in 1982.
The Employment Institute, an independent research body, said women
experienced more breaks from employment than men and were more likely to
work part-time, so were less likely to accumulate the necessary National
Insurance contributions to qualify for unemployment benefit.
An unemployed married woman who is eligible for unemployment benefit may not
be eligible for means-tested income support because of her husband's
earnings, and would not be counted as unemployed when her husband's
entitlement to unemployment benefit expired after a year without work.
One way of assessing the degree to which the rules distort the measurement
of women's unemployment is to compare the claimant count with survey-based
measures of unemployment such as those provided by the International Labour
Organisation. This bases its definition of unemployment on being out of work
and actively looking for a job.
The ILO estimated UK unemployment at 9.4 per cent of the workforce last year
 -8.3 per cent for women and 10.1 per cent for men. Government figures
showed unemployment at 10.7 per cent for men and 4.5 per cent for women.
The ILO's results are reinforced by figures produced in the UK's
labour-force survey, which is based on the same definition.
According to the Employment Institute the survey approach can also disguise
the real extent of female unemployment, because unemployed women are less
likely than men to say they are immediately available for work because they
often have to make arrangements for childcare. In addition jobless women
often fail to perceive themselves as such because they are actively doing
housework.
The National Institute for Social Research forecasts that on government
figures the ratio of female-to-male unemployment will widen slightly,
reflecting the continuing shake-out in the manufacturing and construction
industries where men are more strongly represented. But the bad news for the
government is that employment can pick up sharply among women with little
impact on the unemployment figures.

FT  16 APR 92 / City analysts 'largely ignore' annual reports
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CITY ANALYSTS pay little attention to company accounts, an academic survey
of the users and preparers of the primary financial document has concluded.
The annual report was ranked only the fifth most important source of
information for analysts after preliminary and interim statements, personal
interviews and company presentations, three academics told the British
Accounting Association annual conference. This was held at the University of
Warwick, and finished yesterday.
Mr Roger Hussey, Mr David Bence and Ms Catherine Wilkie of Bristol Business
School found that preparers and users view the annual report very
differently. Their work showed that 91 per cent of analysts perceived the
objective of the report as being to comply with legal requirements, and 71
per cent as being to present a good image of the company. Only a third
thought the aim was to provide information for investment decisions or to
give shareholders an indication of the company's value.
Most analysts claimed the notes to the financial statements, the group
profit and loss account, group balance sheet and the cashflow statement were
the most important items in the report. But few appeared to scrutinise
accounts for bad accounting practice.
Mr Tony Brinn, Mr Mike Peel and Mr Roydon Roberts, from Cardiff Business
School, told the conference that audit fees increased with the size and
complexity of unquoted companies and were lower outside London and
south-east England.
In a study of 77 independent electrical goods and electronics companies,
they found that the fees charged by the biggest eight audit firms were
higher than those of other auditors.
They also found that audit fees were lower than for comparable unquoted
businesses which are subsidiaries of other companies.
A survey of practitioners in Australia, by Mr Kevin Adams and Mr David
Kimber from the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology, showed that the
vast majority of auditors want a limit on their liability in cases of
professional negligence. The Accounting Standards Board is restructuring the
way it arbitrates contentious accounting practices following complaints from
companies that the mechanism is undemocratic, it emerged yesterday.
The changes will affect the operation of the urgent issues task force, which
was established by the ASB last year to give swift rulings on the legitimacy
of accounting practices as soon as they emerged.
The task force will publicise the subjects it is considering more widely,
produce an interim discussion of a subject and then allow at least a month
for additional consultation before its binding 'abstract' on a topic is
released.
The move follows complaints from businesses that they have been taken by
surprise at the speed and impact of previous task force pronouncements.

FT  16 APR 92 / Lord Lane a 'scapegoat' for justice failures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE, Legal Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LORD Donaldson, Master of the Rolls, yesterday spoke of the 'outrage' felt
by the judiciary at attempts to make Lord Lane, the outgoing Lord Chief
Justice, 'the scapegoat for failures of the criminal justice system'.
The Master of the Rolls was addressing more than 60 judges, who together
with barristers and solicitors, had crowded Lord Lane's court to pay tribute
to him on his retirement after 12 years in office. Lord Donaldson said that
for the first time he could break the judiciary's 'Trappist vows' and speak
publicly of the admiration and affection in which Lord Lane was held.
'I can give voice to the anger and disgust which we have felt at the
campaign of calumny waged against you in recent months,' he said.
Lord Lane, 73, came under heavy criticism in the media for his handling of
the first appeal of the Birmingham Six, convicted of an IRA bomb attack.
His refusal to apologise to the men when they were finally released, or to
acknowledge the part courts played in keeping them in prison for 16 years,
led to calls from more than 100 MPs for his resignation. His actions were
widely seen as a significant factor in the loss of public confidence in the
criminal justice system and the judiciary.
Lord Donaldson said judges accepted public criticism as an occupational
hazard, and when based on fact rather than hindsight this was valuable.
'But what has outraged all of us is the spectacle of attempts to make you
the scapegoat for failures of the criminal justice system, the cause of
which, however defined, lay outside your control or responsibility. This
process has gone far beyond the point at which it could be excused as
confusion of thought.'
Lord Donaldson said Lord Lane had faced formidable problems when he came
into office. Administration of the criminal courts was in disarray, there
was widespread criticism of inconsistencies in sentencing and anxieties
about the growing prison population.
He had tackled all these problems, urging that custodial sentences should
not be a day longer than necessary, and had set in train many guideline
decisions on sentencing policy.
Lord Lane had been a party to many decisions which would continue to shape
criminal law for years to come. Most recently he had been involved in
modernising the law on rape in marriage.
Lord Donaldson added: 'In the eyes of the profession, there are judges and
great judges. Your place will be found in the latter category.'

FT  16 APR 92 / Knightsbridge building sale
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A CONSORTIUM of Middle Eastern investors has bought a building in London's
Knightsbridge for Pounds 21m, in one of the largest property transactions in
Knightsbridge in recent years.
The building, opposite Harrods department store, has nine shops on the
ground floor, 13,600 sq ft of offices on the first, and 79 apartments on
eight floors, sold on long leases. The vendor was a joint venture between
Argent, a private company, and Mountleigh, the property company.

FT  16 APR 92 / Boost in business spending forecast
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BARCHARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BUSINESS confidence has been enhanced by the result of the general election,
members of the Finance &amp; Leasing Association said yesterday, David Barchard
writes.
Mr Tony Mallin, association vice-president, said: 'Members are encouraged by
the results of the general election. The return of a strong, stable
government should mean that businesses will now feel able to commit
themselves to positive investment decisions.'
The latest internal economic survey among association members, which account
for more than 30 per cent of UK fixed investment, predicts that companies
will now be willing to invest more.
The association's optimism contrasts with a poor performance by the leasing
and business finance sectors last year. The association says that leasing
business fell by 1 per cent to Pounds 10.2bn, while other forms of business
lending were down by 26 per cent at Pounds 4.3bn.
Investment in plant and equipment was down 10 per cent in cash terms.
Several sectors which did badly last year, however, say they expect an
increase in business volumes in the next three months.
Motor finance business is expected to do better in this quarter by more than
70 per cent of members, and about half believe there will be an improvement
in the Pounds 1m to Pounds 5m range of lease and hire-purchase business.

FT  16 APR 92 / Sir Peter Levene appointed to Major's personal staff
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIR PETER Levene, who is reputed to have saved taxpayers nearly Pounds 1bn
by reorganising the procurement arm of the Ministry of Defence, has been
appointed adviser on efficiency to Mr John Major, the prime minister. His
was one of a clutch of appointments involving the prime minister's personal
staff and top posts in Whitehall announced from 10 Downing Street yesterday.
Other significant changes include the appointment of Mr Alex Allan as the
prime minister's principal private secretary, in succession to Mr Andrew
Turnbull, who is to return to the Treasury.
Sir Rodric Braithwaite, Britain's ambassador in Moscow, will become the
prime minister's foreign affairs adviser when he returns to London.
Sir Peter, 50, is deputy chairman and managing director of Wasserstein
Perella, the US investment banking concern, and chairman of the Docklands
Light Railway.
He will combine his new post with his existing responsibilities as adviser
on competition and purchasing.
Sir Peter will report direct to the prime minister on the progress made in
securing substantial improvements in the management of the public services.
He had a controversial introduction to the Civil Service machine after being
appointed personal adviser to Mr Michael Heseltine, then defence secretary,
in 1984.
Political sniping from Labour MPs and disquiet among career civil servants
intensified when he became chief of defence procurement the following year
on a special contract said to be worth Pounds 100,000 a year.
As the savings resulting from Sir Peter's commercial input mounted, most of
his critics were disarmed, and the effectiveness of the new procurement
regime was increasingly recognised by the time he completed his contract in
April last year.
Sir Peter, who shares the prime minister's enthusiasm for watching Chelsea
Football Club play at home, will be based in the office of the minister for
the Civil Service.
He replaces Sir Angus Fraser, the former chairman of the board of Customs
and Excise, who agreed in 1988 to serve as efficiency adviser until the
general election.
Mr Richard Wilson, deputy secretary (industry) at the Treasury, is to be
permanent secretary at the Department of the Environment in succession to
Sir Terence Heiser, who retires in June.
Mr Hayden Phillips, who has been responsible for Civil Service management
and pay at the Treasury since January 1990, is to be permanent secretary at
the new Department of National Heritage.

FT  16 APR 92 / Scottish rule on Fraser's agenda
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT showed yesterday that Scotland's constitutional arrangements
are on its agenda by listing 'constitutional affairs' among the
responsibilities of Lord Fraser of Carmyllie, the new Scottish Office
minister of state.
There was no indication from the Scottish Office of what Lord Fraser, who
was formerly the Lord Advocate, will do in exercising this responsibility,
which is part of his home affairs portfolio. He will also take care of
health and social work, and will represent the Scottish Office in the House
of Lords.
According to the department, the designation 'constitutional affairs' has
never before appeared in the list of responsibilities of Scottish Office
ministers. Lord Fraser has in the past favoured devolution.
The Conservatives said in their election manifesto that they remained
'willing to consider ways of improving the government of Scotland' but said
proposals had to be judged by the extent to which they would 'strengthen or
undermine the union'.
Options likely to be considered range from improving the way in which
Scottish business is dealt with at Westminster to creating some form of
representative body in Scotland to complement the single-tier structure of
local authorities which the government plans to introduce to replace the
current two-tier structure.
The general council of the Scottish Trades Union Congress yesterday
postponed a decision on whether to take the unprecedented step of inviting
the Scottish National party to address the STUC's annual congress starting
this weekend.
The general council will make its decision on Sunday after tomorrow's
meeting of the Scottish Constitutional Convention, a body dominated by the
Labour and Liberal Democrat parties.

FT  16 APR 92 / Prime minister plays a long game: The strategy behind the
ministerial appointments
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN Major has tried to play a long game in selecting his ministerial
team below cabinet rank.
The prime minister has looked to pre-empt disgruntlement among Conservative
parliamentary ranks across a four or five year parliament. A fourth election
victory could easily turn to irritability or complacency among backbenchers.
Consulting closely with Mr Richard Ryder, the chief whip, Mr Major has
promoted ministers he believes might yet become cabinet material. Mr Major
believes that stamping his own mark on the government, to replace that of
Mrs Margaret Thatcher, is an evolving process that still has some way to go.
The selection is nevertheless somewhat eclectic. Fellow cricket fans like Mr
Robert Atkins, moved by Mr Major to become minister of state at the Northern
Ireland Office, have survived against expectations. Mr Nicholas Soames, who
few expected to see in ministerial office, has started on the junior ranks
at agriculture.
The biggest change in direction is likely from the expanded Department of
Trade and Industry team under Mr Michael Heseltine. Industry policy will
become the immediate responsibility of Mr Tim Sainsbury, the cautious former
parliamentary private secretary to Mr Heseltine. Export promotion falls to
another Heseltine admirer, the affable and energetic Mr Richard Needham,
promoted from the Northern Ireland Office. Mr Tim Eggar will take the DTI's
new responsibilities for energy policy.
Another theme is the pre-eminence of the Treasury - reflected also in the
trading yesterday of senior civil servants between the Treasury and 10
Downing Street.
Mr Stephen Dorrell, the 40-year-old new financial secretary to the Treasury,
is regarded as highly able and a potential cabinet minister. Mr Anthony
Nelson, the new economic secretary, will enhance the job by taking in the
Treasury's new responsibilities for the financial services industry.
Elsewhere Mr Major has followed an almost textbook course of balancing right
and left within his party.
He has Thatcherite No Turning Back Group supporters in his cabinet. In lower
ranks he has Mr John Redwood, the new environment minister, Mr Eric Forth,
junior education minister, and Mr Michael Forsyth, employment minister.
At the same time he appointed Mr Robert Hughes to the government whips
office. Mr Hughes was a parliamentary private secretary to former Tory prime
minister Mr Edward Heath.
Mr Major has offered some of the new entrants a government post when they
must have thought they had become confirmed backbenchers.
Mr Michael Mates, the Northern Ireland Office minister and former campaign
manager of Mr Heseltine, had been passed over many times before. Mr Nigel
Forman, junior education minister, has been brought in from the cold after
being parliamentary private secretary to Mr Nigel Lawson, the former
chancellor blamed by many Tories for mismanaging the economy.
The official explanation is that Mr Major wanted to tap talent from across
the party. But it also reduces the number of long-standing backbenchers
harbouring resentment for being overlooked.
For bright entrants or relative newcomers there remains the prospect of
promotion as ministers who fail to make the grade are pulled out.

FT  16 APR 92 / Lloyd's Names step up action
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK and RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A GROUP of the hardest-hit Names at the Lloyd's insurance market is
attempting to join forces with an existing action group representing those
on other syndicates managed by the same agency.
Members of Gooda Walker 387, a syndicate projected to face one of the
largest losses in Lloyd's recent history, resolved yesterday to try to
establish links with the Gooda Walker Action Group, headed by Mr Alfred
Doll-Steinberg.
The Names also called on Mr Peter Nutting - a member of 387 and of the
Council of Lloyd's, the market's governing body - to press for an immediate
review of the syndicate's losses.
Names are individuals whose assets back underwriting at Lloyd's. Members of
387 face losses of more than Pounds 35m - seven times the amount they
committed - for the 1989 underwriting year.
Mr Nutting came to prominence earlier this year when he led a successful
legal campaign by Names on the Outhwaite syndicate. Nearly 1,000 Outhwaite
Names recovered Pounds 116m of losses in an out-of-court settlement.
Loss reviews are normally triggered when losses exceed 100 per cent of a
syndicate's capacity - its capital base. A number of reviews are under way
but the 1989 underwriting year has not yet been closed.
Previous efforts for Names on 387 to combine forces with those on other
Gooda Walker syndicates have met resistance from Mr Doll-Steinberg. He
argues that 387 did not specialise in spiral reinsurance business, by which
syndicates and London market companies reinsure each other's exposure to
catastrophe losses.
By contrast, syndicate 387 specialised in personal stop-loss insurance,
providing reinsurance to individual Names to cover against excessive losses
within the market.
Yesterday's action coincides with evidence of an increasing rift between the
Gooda Walker Action group, its chairman, Mr Doll-Steinberg, and other Names'
associations.
A number of different Names' groups agreed last week to support a new
grouping backed by both the Association of Lloyd's Names and the Society of
Names, which is seeking a negotiated settlement of grievances with the
Lloyd's authorities. But Mr Doll-Steinberg refused to back the new grouping,
which is also chaired by Mr Nutting.

FT  16 APR 92 / Moscow ecologist wins the David Thomas prize
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE 1992 David Thomas Prize has been awarded to Dr Olga Speranskaya, aged
29, an ecologist from Moscow.
She received the Pounds 2,000 prize from Ms Jenny Rossiter, who chaired the
trustees, at a ceremony at the Financial Times headquarters in London last
night. The prize has been established in memory of David Thomas, the FT
Resources Editor, who died last April with Alan Harper, an FT photographer,
in an accident in Kuwait.
Candidates had to write on the topic 'What will the collapse of Communism do
to the Environment?', and submit a proposal on how they would use the award
to explore the theme further. Dr Speranskaya, whose visit to London is her
first trip outside the former Soviet Union, intends to use her prize to
travel to the Lake Baikal region to study the extent of the environmental
and ecological problems.
Dr Speranskaya - a graduate of Moscow State University - is the Moscow
representative at the International Baikal Region's Ecological Security
Centre but has never been able to visit the area. Lake Baikal, in Siberia,
is the deepest fresh-water lake in the world. It is roughly the size of
Belgium and is heavily polluted from pulp and paper mills.

FT  16 APR 92 / Marco Polo satellite may soon be redundant
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A LEGISLATIVE Catch 22 threatens to turn the multi-million Marco Polo
satellite into a useless piece of scrap metal by the end of this year.
The Independent Television Commission would like to see the former BSB
satellite carry a variety of public service channels such as ones devoted to
parliament, the Asian-language, and education.
The ITC yesterday called for expressions of interest on how the Marco Polo
satellite could be used from the beginning of next year.
At present the satellite carries five channels of Sky Television for former
BSB customers with 'squarial' dishes. From the beginning of next year Sky
Television will be available only from the Astra satellite system and cable
networks.
The problem is that under the 1990 Broadcasting Act the ITC has to issue
licences for 15 years and make sure that applicants have the finances to
sustain the service throughout that time.
The Marco Polo satellite has only another eight to 10 years before it runs
out of power. That means applicants must have enough money to buy or rent a
new satellite for the last six years or so of the licence.
Mr George Russell, the chairman of the ITC, said recently: 'Once again we
can see that the Broadcasting Act was drawn up far too restrictively.'
The very lack of flexibility, the ITC chairman added, 'could bring this
particular aspect of broadcasting to a shambles'.
If the ITC has not licensed any new service by the end of this year former
BSB viewers will get no service from their equipment. BSkyB does have an
obligation to replace the equip-ment free of charge with Astra equipment.
New channels aimed at minority and special-interest groups would get a
satellite channel at a token rent.
If nobody is prepared to take on the obligation to fund and run a service
for 15 years the ITC may have to try to persuade the government to amend the
legislation.

FT  16 APR 92 / Harrow abandons national pay talks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LONDON borough of Harrow is to abandon national pay-bargaining
arrangements for all workers except teachers, highlighting a likely
acceleration of the trend towards local pay determination in the public
sector.
Local pay bargaining by councils, Civil Service departments and hospital
trusts has been given fresh impetus by the Conservative general election
victory.
The government is keen to encourage the erosion of national negotiating
machinery which it considers is often too inflexible to deal with local
needs.
About 25 of the UK's 450 local authorities have withdrawn from national pay
talks in the past two years, but Harrow is the first London borough to do
so.
Mr John Coe, chief personnel officer at Conservative-controlled Harrow, said
he knew of two other London authorities that were considering pulling out of
national negotiations.
A small number of larger authorities outside London were also looking at
local pay arrangements and not all were Conservative controlled.
Harrow councillors have agreed in principle to negotiate locally from next
year for 4,000 white and blue-collar workers. Most councils with local
bargaining have opted out of the national framework only for white-collar
workers.
Mr Coe warned councillors that they should not regard local bargaining as a
means of keeping pay down. Rises would depend on the council's ability to
pay but it was also important to have rates which enabled the borough to
recruit and keep staff.
He said local bargaining would give the council increased flexibility.

FT  16 APR 92 / Teacher redundancies warning
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TEACHERS face mass redundancies unless ministers intervene to increase local
authority budgets, a teachers' union leader claimed yesterday.
Mr Peter Smith, general secretary of AMMA - the second largest teachers'
union - said: 'unless action is taken at national and local level, teacher
redundancies on a scale never experienced before will hit the profession'.
The 145,000-strong union was already dealing with 500 threatened
redundancies, he told AMMA's annual conference in Birmingham. Other unions
also report a sharp rise in redundancy levels.
Mr Smith blamed rate-capping, opting-out, and local management of schools
for this 'distressing and serious new scenario.'
Most local education authorities are spending up to their capping ceiling
this year, and many have reduced school budgets - in real terms - in order
to meet a teachers' pay award (7.8 per cent) above the expected level. Under
local management - in the process of being introduced across England and
Wales - schools receive a budget related to their number of pupils: those
with small or declining rolls face a sudden loss of funding.
'John Patten (education secretary) must put an urgent review of local
management at the top of his agenda,' said Mr Smith. He claimed that the
position was no less serious in the independent sector, where up to 180
redundancies had been made or threatened in recent months - in addition to
more than 256 job losses caused by the closure of 10 schools (mainly for
girls) since the summer.
Still in recession and with fee increases far outstripping inflation,
matching this year's state-sector pay award is a serious problem for the
independent sector. Several schools are known to have offered less.

FT  16 APR 92 / Rail unions poised to back 4.5% pay offer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UNION leaders representing 116,000 rail staff were yesterday considering a
fresh pay offer of 4.5 per cent from British Rail costing Pounds 79m.
The TSSA white-collar union and the Aslef drivers' union looked set to
recommend acceptance.
A meeting of the largest rail union, the RMT, went on longer than expected.
It is the first public-sector pay offer since the election and is  1/2 a
percentage point above the rate of inflation.
Earlier this month the unions rejected BR's offer of 4 per cent.
It would also be the first pay offer for the rail industry for nearly a
century which, as far as BR is concerned, did not take place within the
structure of the Railway Staff's National Council.
The British Rail board terminated the existing negotiating machinery on
April 6 and wants to devolve as much bargaining as possible to BR's five
businesses and 30 profit centres.
In principle the unions are not opposed to this. They are worried, however,
about not being able to refer upwards matters discussed at profit-centre
level.
Interim arrangements will prevail up to September. Until then talks will
continue on the final shape of the new devolved-bargaining system.
The BR pay offer means an extra Pounds 8.95 a week for drivers, whose basic
rate will be Pounds 207.55 a week. Typical station staff will receive an
extra Pounds 6.20, with a new rate of Pounds 143.85.
BR's latest offer is conditional on an early settlement.
The board is understood to want agreement before the Easter weekend.
BR is in the final phase of a two-year change from a regional structure to a
business-led structure.
The TSSA said it would definitely recommend acceptance to other unions. It
is understood that the TSSA's position could change if other unions reject
the deal.
Pay talks are likely to resume next week for 250,000 civil servants. The
government is committed to raising the pay bill by between 4.5 per cent and
8 per cent following a survey of comparable private-sector jobs.

<TEXT>
THE European Community's strategy to meet its commitment to stabilise carbon
dioxide emissions at 1990 levels by the end of the century is running into
problems, less than two months before the United Nations Earth Summit in Rio
de Janeiro.
Two draft directives to monitor energy use in commercial and residential
buildings - accounting for an estimated 47 per cent of EC energy consumption
 -were yesterday blocked in the European Commission, at a meeting of senior
officials to review the strategy.
New-found reluctance by Brussels to interfere in matters which should
properly be handled by member states was said by one official to be the
cause of the hold-up in this innocuous-looking, but critical, part of the
Commission's anti-global warming strategy.
Any weakening of such conventional means of limiting emissions could force a
rethink of the entire strategy, a senior Commission environment official
conceded yesterday.
The part of the strategy which has drawn most attention, and criticism, is
the carbon and energy tax which Brussels is poised to put forward next
month. The Commission reckons the EC needs this tax because it could meet
only three-fifths of its CO2 reduction target by conventional energy-saving
measures.
But while industry is up in arms about the implications of the tax for
competition, it is the conventional part of the strategy which is beginning
to unravel fastest.
By the end of last month, for instance, only four of the 12 member states
had submitted promised 'complementary programmes' to cut CO2 emissions. Nor
are the EC's own energy conservation and renewable energy programmes yet on
stream.
Mr Andrew Warren of the European Association for the Conservation of Energy
told a Forum Europe global warming seminar for industrialists on Tuesday
that 'there is no urgency behind these programmes from the Commission. Nor
is there sufficient urgency from most member states for their programmes. In
their absence, the (energy) tax becomes omnipresent.'
The two directives causing problems yesterday will come up again for
discussion by the full Commission within two to three weeks. There may then
be attempts to fold them into the centrepiece directive containing the
energy tax.
Mr Carlo Ripa di Meana, environment commissioner, had wanted to present a
rounded strategy to a pre-Rio ministerial meeting of EC environment and
development ministers on May 4. The Commission itself is now unlikely to
make up its mind until May 6 or 13, leaving the environment ministers'
meeting scheduled for May 26 as the last chance to formulate a greenhouse
gas strategy to take to Rio.

FT  16 APR 92 / Peru economic plan imperilled by aid freeze: Leslie Crawford
reports that a balance of payments crisis may follow Fujimori's palace coup
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LESLIE CRAWFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PERU'S ECONOMIC stabilisation programme appears to be in jeopardy because of
the suspension of international aid following President Alberto Fujimori's
palace coup on April 5.
The country faces a balance of payments crisis because it can no longer rely
on a Dollars 1.3bn debt-relief package put together by the Support Group of
creditor nations. The money would have allowed Peru to clear debt payment
arrears with the World Bank, International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the
Inter-American Development Bank (IADB). This in turn would have paved the
way for a rescheduling agreement with commercial banks, owed more than half
of Peru's Dollars 23bn foreign debt.
Of the Dollars 1.3bn pledged by the support group, Peru has received only
Dollars 300m from Japan in December. A further Dollars 100m linked to an
IADB loan is due from Japan. The US has frozen Dollars 320m in economic aid,
most of it earmarked for debt relief. Germany has suspended Dollars 110m in
development grants and Spain some Dollars 50m. Humanitarian aid is
unaffected. The US emergency food programme estimates it feeds 3m people, or
one in seven Peruvians, who would otherwise starve.
The IADB, the only bank currently lending to Peru, has put about Dollars
400m of credits on hold. Mr Fujimori's cash-strapped government needed the
IADB loans to reactivate the economy, which is still suffering from the
shock of an IMF austerity programme.
'The government faces a dilemma,' says Mr Jorge Chavez, president of Peru's
Central Bank. 'It either draws down international reserves to meet its
foreign obligations, or it declares a new moratorium, which would set back
Peru's rehabilitation within the international financial community.'
Peru has Dollars 1.4bn in reserves, but Mr Chavez would resist any attempts
by Mr Fujimori to draw on the funds. 'I will not lend the government a
single dollar to pay debt arrears,' he says, 'it would be an irresponsible
use of reserves.'
He says the coup took him by surprise. He was at an IADB meeting in the
Dominican Republic when Mr Fujimori installed a military-backed 'emergency
government," closing parliament and the judiciary. He believes Peru's only
hope of winning back financial aid will depend on Mr Fujimori's announcing a
timetable for the rapid restoration of democracy.
Unless this happens, many believe that Mr Chavez, who has clashed with the
president in the past, will resign.
Mr Fujimori is also under pressure to produce a quick turnaround in the
economy, now that he has 'unshackled' himself from the parliament he so
despised. 'The coup has raised expectations that people's living standards
will improve,' says Dr Jorge Gonzalez Izquierdo, the economics dean at
Lima's Universidad del Pacifico. 'If the austerity continues, Fujimori's
popularity will plummet.'
Mr Fujimori maintains that the about Dollars 90m 'saved' by closing Congress
will be spent on raising teachers' wages and social programmes. Dr Gonzalez
Izquierdo maintains that this is pure demagoguery: 'The government has
failed to implement a single programme to alleviate poverty since it took
office 22 months ago.'
The business community, which overwhelmingly endorsed the coup, is expecting
favours. Exporters want the central bank to intervene in the open foreign
exchange market to bring about a devaluation of the sol. The currency's
strength against the dollar is the result of a flood of drug money and
speculative capital and has transformed Lima into one of the most expensive
cities in Latin America. Industrialists want lower taxes, lower interest
rates and a freer labour code.
Some economists, like Mr Hernando de Soto, question the effectiveness of the
government's macroeconomic programme in the absence of deeper social
reforms. He says that 92 per cent of farmers do not have titles to their
land. Unable to obtain credit, they were condemned to poverty.
Only 150,000, out of 23m Peruvians, paid tax last year, with tax evasion
preventing the government from being able to provide basic health and
education services, let alone equip an army to fight a fully-fledged civil
war which has claimed 23,000 lives, mostly civilian, in 12 years.
The tensions were visible when Mr Fujimori addressed the tourist business
council this week. His speech was subdued and offered no clues about how he
intends to manage the economy or his timetable for political reform.

JAPANESE prime minister Kiichi Miyazawa and two of his predecessors
yesterday opened an 'eminent persons' conference in Tokyo called to work out
ways to foot the bill for preventing worldwide environmental destruction,
Reuter reports from Tokyo.
Some 30 business and political leaders will meet for three days to consider
how to pay for projects approved at the Earth Summit in Brazil.
'Japan has both the responsibility and capacity to play a leading role in
constructing a society which can co-exist and co-prosper with the global
environment,' former premier Noboru Takeshita told the conference of VIPs.
Hopes were running high that the conference would come up with a specific
figure for environmental funds.
Conference officials denied this, but agreed billions of dollars would be
needed and said that the developing world would be asked to foot much of the
bill.
Former US President Jimmy Carter told yesterday's opening session rich
nations were to blame for environmental woes.

CATERPILLAR, the world's largest maker of earth-moving equipment, yesterday
turned away workers returning from a five-month strike. They were going back
to their jobs after an agreement to end the strike was reached late on
Tuesday, Barbara Durr writes from Chicago.
The accord between the company and the United Auto Workers' union emerged
from two days of talks with a mediator. It amounts to a big setback for the
union.
Until contract negotiations restart next week, UAW members will work under
the terms of Caterpillar's last contract offer.
Caterpillar said it would stop hiring replacement workers but might not be
able to take back all the strikers. As if to rub that point in, the company
turned away returning union workers, saying it was not ready for them.
It said it had changed some technical processes in its plants and would
assess how many of the returning union members it would need to call back.

TRADING at Chicago's futures markets and other businesses suffered for a
third day yesterday after floods and power cuts following an accident in the
underground system on Monday.
The Chicago Board of Trade, the largest futures exchange in the world,
opened for just two hours yesterday and will open only a few more hours
today. The market has traded the equivalent of only one full day over the
three days since the floods.
Department stores were still closed yesterday. Unofficial estimates put the
losses in damage and lost sales since Monday at around Dollars 1m (Pounds
565,000) a day.
Mr Thomas Donovan, CBOT president, said it was essential the futures markets
opened 'as soon as possible'.
Trading volume at the London International Financial Futures Exchange had
increased by about 400 per cent since the flood on Monday, according to Mr
Donovan.
The CBOT's closure has also affected the financial and agricultural markets.
There has been no trading in the CBOT's futures on the US Treasury bond, the
most actively traded futures in the world.
In the grain market, the inability to hedge transactions has led to
cancellation of orders from around the world and has virtually halted the
movement of grain into US storage elevators.
The Chicago Mercantile Exchange, the world's second largest futures market,
the Chicago Board Options Exchange, the world's largest options market, and
the Midwest Stock Exchange, were trading normally yesterday.
The business district has been declared a federal disaster area by President
Bush.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
WITH LESS than two months before its opening, the Earth Summit seems in
danger of turning into a circus.
Work has only just started on converting the Riocentro exhibition centre in
Rio de Janeiro into a suitable venue for the two-week event, which is
intended to be the world's biggest ever gathering of government leaders and
heads of state.
So far, four phone boxes appear to be the only facilities for press and
delegates. A pile of rubble represents what is to be the main entrance.
In the past month, Brazil's foreign minister has resigned and its eccentric
but internationally respected environment minister sacked. The summit
organiser is waiting to see if his resignation will be accepted and one of
his main assistants has quit.
So far behind are preparations that when the Islamic world asked for the
conference to be delayed to accommodate a religious holiday, many suspected
the Brazilians put them up to it.
Although 95 countries have so far confirmed that they will be present, US
President George Bush's continued snubbing of the affair is likely to result
in last-minute cancellations. The later date means that Mr John Major, the
British prime minister, is unlikely to be at the heads of government meeting
at the end of the summit because it clashes with the trooping of the colour
to mark the Queen's 40th year on throne.
Mr Flavio Perri, conference co-ordinator, insists all will be well. He
promises to be drinking champagne to toast the centre's completion on May
25, the date he is due to hand Riocentro over to the United Nations.
Mr Perri admits that allocating accommodation for the estimated 12,000
official delegates was 'a complete nightmare'.
Everyone so far has applied for the handful of five-star hotels. The Germans
and Canadians are no longer speaking after a wrangle over the same hotel.
The British delegates are understood to have used less than gentlemanly
tactics to get the rooms they wanted. Locally-based diplomats and the
Brazilian organisers are barely speaking.
'I doubt I'll survive this,' says Mr Perri. 'Either someone will assassinate
me or I'll die from the strain.'
Meanwhile, a cholera epidemic has finally reached Brazil's north-east and
threatens to hit Rio in time for the big event.
But one of the biggest threats to the event is Rio's notorious crime rate.
Even with new weapons for the occasion, the Rio police will be less well
equipped than the city's drug-trafficking and kidnap gangs. If Mr Bush
decides after all to attend, he will stay in Braslia, the capital, because
nowhere in Rio is considered safe enough.
No security scheme has yet been elaborated but the army, navy and air force
are all being called in to patrol the streets and French police have been
giving lessons in security learnt from the 1989 revolution bicentennial.
Street children who make their living from petty crime have been cleared
from the streets near where delegates will stay and moved to the city
centre. A road has been built from the airport to bypass the worst parts of
the city.
But carnival fever is in the air. Rio residents are awaiting a jamboree. The
main conference days have been declared an official city holiday, taxi
drivers are looking forward to booming trade, and local entrepreneurs are
preparing packets of authentic Copacabana sand to sell as souvenirs.

FT  16 APR 92 / Decline in rate of US industrial growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US industrial growth slowed last month, with output rising only 0.2 per cent
compared with a 0.5 per cent gain in February, the Federal Reserve reported
yesterday.
The figure, although broadly in line with analysts' forecasts, follows other
recent evidence of a sluggish economy, including a fall in retail sales and
flat employment last month.
In the first quarter, production declined at an annual rate of 4.1 per cent
from the previous quarter. This was mainly because of a sharp fall in output
in January. It is the second successive quarter of industrial contraction.
On an annual comparison, however, industrial production was up 2.1 per cent
in the twelve months to March, reflecting a recovery in output last summer.
The Fed remains anxious about the pace of recovery. Last week it surprised
financial markets by signalling a quarter-point cut in short-term interest
rates to 3.75 per cent, the first reduction since December. Many analysts
anticipate a further modest easing of monetary policy if the economy fails
to gather momentum.
Most economists are projecting modest growth of industrial output in coming
months. This reflects relatively strong growth in demand in consumer
spending in the first quarter and a projected rebuilding of corporate
inventories after liquidation of stocks in recent months.
Figures published yesterday showed the ratio of business inventories to
sales continued to fall in February, reflecting stronger than expected
demand.
Most industrial sectors were sluggish in March. Manufacturing output edged
up 0.1 per cent but capacity utilisation at factories fell 0.1 per cent to
77 per cent. Output of construction supplies fell 0.2 per cent.
Output of non-durable consumer goods rose 0.4 per cent, but this mainly
reflected a sharp 2.1 per cent rise in the output of utilities, a reaction
after declines due to unseasonably warm weather.
The strongest sector was durable consumer goods, which rose 0.5 per cent
despite a decline in car production.

FT  16 APR 92 / Poker game ahead of Earth Summit: Negotiators preparing for
Rio are caught up in a tense game
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN HUNT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEGOTIATORS charged with drafting a convention to combat global warming in
time for approval at the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro in June, are to meet
again in two weeks, in a last-ditch effort to resolve differences among the
140 countries involved.
A gathering of the International Negotiating Committee (INC) in New York
from April 30 to May 8 will follow five preparatory conferences over the
past year, all of which ended in deadlock. As late as last February, the
committee was able to produce only the sketchiest of outlines, and even then
nearly every page was a forest of square brackets denoting sections where
representatives were in dispute.
'It has become a big poker game,' says Ms Fiona Weir, campaigner for
atmosphere protection at Friends of the Earth, the British-based
international environment organisation. 'They are all staring into each
others' eyes to see who will blink first.' Friends of the Earth and other
international 'green' organisations are calling on governments to convene an
emergency meeting of their environment ministers to save the negotiations.
At the centre of the dispute is the refusal of the US to set a national
target for emissions of carbon dioxide, the most potent of the gases
responsible for global warming.
Mr Robert Reinstein, head of the US delegation, insists each country should
draw up an action plan to reduce emissions of global-warming gases 'as best
it can', taking into account its own particular circumstances.
Moreover, the US would continue to oppose rigid, quantitative targets and
timetables, whether for carbon dioxide or for other gases such as methane,
nitrous oxide, ozone and chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs). The US administration
believes stabilisation by 2000 would damage its economy, which depends on
the fossil fuels that create carbon dioxide.
This policy angers Third World countries, which see it as a determination by
the US to continue its 'gas guzzling' habits. They point to a study by US
economists which says carbon emissions could be cut by 35 per cent with
little or no cost to the US economy.
Developing countries led by the Group of 77 Third World countries, plus
China, see no reason to commit themselves to a global plan unless the US and
other industrialised countries give a lead. They argue that, since the
industrialised countries produce three-quarters of the world's carbon
dioxide emissions, they should bear the main responsibility for cleaning it
up.
The intergovernmental panel of scientists established to investigate climate
change says that, unless action is taken now, global temperatures could rise
1 degree Celsius by 2025, with bigger increases later in the century. This
would cause rises in sea levels and wide flooding; the warmer climate could
upset world agricultural production.
Meanwhile, the INC has not even been able to endorse these warnings in its
draft preamble. While some representatives argue that there will be 'serious
social, economic and environmental consequences', others want no mention of
'serious' and reference only to 'potential' climate change.
European Community members want all developed countries to adopt the EC
target of stabilising carbon dioxide by 2000 as the basis for an agreement,
but some countries, notably oil-producers, join the US in wanting a pledge
that stabilisation will only be achieved 'as soon as feasible'.
Britain, having already had one compromise plan rejected, is now pressing
another, a 'phased progressive approach': targets would be set for
stabilising carbon dioxide by 2000 and methane at another fixed date, with
other gases to be included in the programme later. A review process would
put 'peer pressure' on countries which were not complying. However, this too
is meeting resistence from developing countries, which are suspicious that
the review might be be an encroachment on their autonomy.
Differences also abound over assistance for developing countries. They want
compensation from industrialised countries, including a new fund to meet the
'full and incremental environmental costs' of implementing any convention.
The US, Britain and other countries within the Organisation of Economic
Co-operation of Development object to the notion of 'compensation' for
environmental damage. They say that any money should be channelled through
the existing Global Environment Facility, which is administered by the World
Bank.
Another vexing problem concerns the transfer of technology to enable Third
World countries to grapple with pollution problems as their industry
expands. They insist they should have preferential non-commercial access to
technology transfer and the use of patents which have been developed in the
west. Industrialised countries say that, while they are prepared to develop
a co-operative mechanism to facilitate the flow of technology, it must be on
a commercial basis.
The INC was charged by the United Nations General Assembly with completing
an effective framework convention to combat climate change with 'appropriate
commitments' in time for the summit's opening on June 1. But, as Mr Tariq
Osman Hyder of Pakistan told the last INC meeting, 'the prognosis for a
successful conclusion in time for Rio cannot be optimistic.'

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GOVERNMENT experts from 56 countries have recommended an accelerated
phase-out of ozone-depleting chemicals in industrialised countries by 1996,
four years earlier than specified by the Montreal Protocol, the United
Nations-sponsored international agreement.
The recommendation, after a 10-day meeting in Geneva, follows new scientific
evidence that ozone concentrations in the earth's atmosphere, which protect
plant and animal life from harmful ultra-violet rays, are decreasing more
rapidly and over a wider area of the globe than previously thought.
The US and EC have already decided unilaterally to phase out
chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), halons and some other ozone-depleting chemicals
by the end of 1995. CFCs are used in refrigeration, aerosols and solvents,
and halons are used in firefighting equipment.
The meeting discussed amendments to the Montreal Protocol to go to a
ministerial meeting in Copenhagen in November. Proposals include:
A phase-out of CFCs, halons, carbon tetrachloride and methyl chloroform
(used in industrial solvents) by January 1 1996. Some countries want this
advanced a year.
Restrictions and eventual phase-out of short-term CFC substitutes, such as
hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) which are also ozone-depleters.
Restrictions and eventual phase-out of bromine-based substances, including
methyl bromide, which are significant ozone-destroyers. Methyl bromide is
widely used as a base for agricultural fumigants and fungicides.
Additional financial and technical assistance for developing countries,
which now have 10 more years than rich nations to implement the Montreal
Protocol, to phase out ozone-depleters more quickly.
Worldwide CFC consumption has already fallen 40 per cent from 1986 levels.
Even so, atmospheric concentrations of chlorine and bromine are expected to
rise into the next century, prompting environmentalists to urge an immediate
and comprehensive ban on ozone-destroying chemicals.

The Russian embassy in Kabul was reported by Russian diplomats to have

There was intense diplomatic activity last night in the Pakistani capital.
Mr Nawaz Sharif, the prime minister, chaired a meeting of representatives of
various mujahideen factions, adding to intense pressure on them to finalise
plans for a representative council to take over government in Kabul. They
were due to meet the Pakistani prime minister again today.
Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the United Nations secretary general had proposed
such a council last week to rule until an interim government is set up with
the task of holding fresh elections.
However, reports of the fall of the strategic Baghram air base have raised
concerns that the process could be derailed.

HOPES of a peace settlement on the copper-rich island of Bougainville
evaporated yesterday after the Papua New Guinea (PNG) government said a
leading negotiator and seven other men had been executed by the outlawed
Bougainville Revolutionary Army (BRA).
Bougainville has been in turmoil since the BRA attacked PNG officials and
partially destroyed the Australian-run Panguna copper mine two years ago as
part of a drive for independence from the former Australian colony.
Hundreds of Bougainvilleans are believed to have died in fighting between
the BRA and PNG troops. Others are said to have died of disease when the
government blockaded the island for several months, cutting off supplies of
food and medical supplies.
Mr Rabbie Namaliu, the prime minister, said the government was 'shocked and
horrified' by the killing of Mr Anthony Anugu, a political leader from South
Bougainville who negotiated a partial settlement with the central
government.

FT  16 APR 92 / G7 partners may urge Japan to boost economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN MAY be urged by its trading partners among the Group of Seven leading
industrial countries to consider further fiscal stimulus to boost its
economy when G7 finance ministers and central bank governors meet in
Washington later this month.
European monetary officials said that Japan was the only big industrial
country in a position to boost its economy and so help world growth. The US,
which is likely to be the G7 nation keenest on promoting expansionary
policies abroad, recognises that the European members of the group have
little scope for action.
If it chose fiscal expansion, Japan could reduce the risk of downward
pressure on the yen that would arise from a further relaxation of monetary
policy, officials added. They said there were indications that Japan might
give its economy a fiscal boost by bringing spending from the second half of
the year forward to the first half.
It emerged yesterday that the recent weakness of the Tokyo stock market has
caused considerable concern among officials from other industrialised
countries. But in a series of recent gatherings that included last weekend's
meeting of Working Party Three of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation
and Development (OECD) and this week's regular central bankers' meeting at
the Bank for International Settlements in Basle, Japan assured its trading
partners that the stock market problems were containable.

DOMESTIC economic reforms will lead to much improved growth prospects for
developing countries in the 1990s, according to a study* published today by
the World Bank.
The bank projects per capita growth of 2.9 per cent a year in the 1990s,
compared with only 1.2 per cent in the debt-ridden 1980s. This represents a
return almost to the golden years of the 1960s, when per capita growth
averaged 3.3 per cent a year in the Third World.
Eastern Europe, however, is set to remain one of the slowest-growing
regions. The bank projects per capita growth of only 1.6 per cent a year in
the region, well below that in Asia or Latin America. No forecasts were made
for former Soviet republics.
The decade started badly for developing countries with per capita incomes
falling in both 1990 and 1991. Most countries continue to face a difficult
external environment:
growth in big industrial countries is likely to average 2.6 per cent a year,
slightly less than in the 1980s;
concessional finance will be scarce, with only the strongest economies able
to tap private capital markets;
real interest rates will stay high at about 3 per cent;
commodity prices are expected to remain at current low levels in the short
term before rising in the second half of the decade.
The bank bases its optimism mainly on 'sweeping policy reforms' taking place
in the developing world. It says countries in every region have sharply
reduced trade quotas and tariffs, resulting in a doubling of the bank's
index of 'trade openness' in the past decade. Trade liberalisation should
underpin real export growth of 7 per cent a year in the 1990s - the best
performance in 35 years.
The report calls on developed countries to support these trends by
dismantling their own trade barriers, particularly those erected against
manufactured goods. It says a 50 per cent reduction in trade barriers in the
US, Japan and the EC would raise developing country exports by more than
Dollars 50bn (Pounds 28bn) - almost as much as the net flow of development
aid.
However, the distribution of the benefits of trade liberalisation in rich
countries would be uneven. Bank figures show that east Asia would probably
win more than 50 per cent of the additional export orders. Latin America
would account for a further 20 per cent. Eastern Europe might win little
more than 7 per cent of the new markets.
The study warns developing country exporters not to rely solely on cheap
labour as a source of competitiveness. It recommends greater investment in
transport and telecommunications and says countries that fail to invest in
education, training and information technology 'will find it increasingly
difficult to compete successfully in the global market for manufactures at
any acceptable wage.'

FT  16 APR 92 / Turkish fears grow on foreign business influx

THE GROWING openness of Turkey's economy to foreign companies has come in
for sharp criticism from domestic businessmen worried about increased
competition.
The opening tomorrow of a new Dollars 70m cement plant by Societe Ciments
Francais (SCF) highlights how opposition to greater foreign involvement has
shifted from politicians to the business community.
It was politicians who resisted French entry into the cement market. In
1990, Mr Suleyman Demirel, now Turkey's prime minister, filed a suit to have
SCF's purchase of five state cement companies declared illegal on the
grounds the assets had not been offered to local investors. But he will open
the SCF plant tomorrow.
Some industrialists are urging the government to freeze privatisation plans
in the face of growing foreign interest. 'Turkish business is not yet strong
enough to purchase these state companies,' says Mr Can Kirac, former
chairman of Koc Holding, Turkey's largest trading company.
Mr Demirel is under pressure to give a clear signal on the controversy about
foreign ownership, especially as it is planning to sell a further 11 cement
companies in a deal expected to raise TL 2,500bn (Pounds 227m).
French companies now account for a quarter of Turkish cement production of
around 24m tonnes a year which is growing at an annual rate of some 10 per
cent. Lafarge Coppee, the world's second largest cement company, and Societe
Vicat have also entered the market.
The arrival of the French has sparked fierce competition. Last month, two
Turkish-owned factories in the Aegean region launched an attempt to try to
break into the Istanbul cement market, shipping cement at prices 40 per cent
below market levels.
The basic investment strategy of most foreign groups is to expand market
share in what is seen as a key regional base for the Middle East and the
southern republics of the former Soviet Union. But there has been local
concern that in so doing, the foreign companies are creating new cartels.
'While trying to destroy one monopoly, the government is creating another
one,' says Mr Yazar Zeytinoglu, chairman of a large conglomerate.
Industries other than cement have also come under increased scrutiny. In the
bottled gas sector, for example, foreign groups, including Mobil of the US,
already control 34 per cent of the market.
The British foreign secretary, Mr Douglas Hurd, will visit Turkey and
probably Greece next week, Reuter reports from London. Diplomats said
Britain and the US viewed Turkey as an increasingly important country in the
region. Mr Hurd will discuss the situation in Iraq, Turkey's possible
membership of the European Community, the Cyprus issue and Turkey's defence
role in Europe.

FT  16 APR 92 / Truck sales on fast road to recovery

<TEXT>
TRUCK SALES in western Europe will recover at an increasing pace this year
and next, following the decline in 1991, according to the German motor
industry association (VDA). It expects especially sharp improvements in
Britain, Sweden, and Spain.
However, the German market, which has been given a considerable lift from
unification of the country, will see a slowdown, the VDA adds. German
producers will have to renew their efforts in foreign markets as a result,
says Mr Kunibert Schmidt, the VDA's deputy managing director. Competition
will continue to be intense and German manufacturers will have to work
harder to offset their country's disadvantage as an industrial location,
especially on costs.
The VDA forecasts that the total west European truck market will rise by 1
per cent this year and 4 per cent next, after a 6 per cent drop in 1991.
Excluding Germany, it expects sales in western Europe to rise 3 per cent and
6 per cent respectively compared with a 14 per cent decline in 1991.
The German market, which jumped by 48 per cent last year, is expected to
fall by 6 per cent in each of the next two years. By contrast, the similarly
sized French market should move up by 2 per cent in 1992 and 5 per cent in
1993 after falling by 12 per cent in 1991.
A marked upturn is forecast in the UK, with last year's slump of 29 per cent
followed by a rise of 8 per cent this year and one of 11 per cent in 1993.
In Sweden, which suffered a 36 per cent collapse in 1991, the market is
likely to fall a further 14 per cent this year before climbing by 28 per
cent in 1993.
Mr Schmidt says German truck production has continued to develop strongly,
with a rise of 11 per cent in the first quarter of this year. Total output
in 1991 was 12.5 per cent higher at 355,500 units.

<TEXT>
ALMOST half the companies in Germany have taken action to improve their
ability to compete in the single European market, due to be introduced at
the turn of the year, according to a survey.
They are 'self-confident and well-equipped', the DIHT chamber of trade and
industry reported yesterday.
An analysis of a survey covering 15,000 businesses, published yesterday,
said most had prepared strategic plans, incorporating several measures, to
enhance their position. The most popular steps were investment and
rationalisation of existing plant, product innovation and improved
marketing. Some 17 per cent had prepared new products.
Setting up abroad had been an option or a priority for relatively few, the
report said. However, 8 per cent had already invested outside Germany
specifically to prepare for the single market, compared with the 5 per cent
which had said they planned such moves in a similar poll three years ago.
Investment targets have also changed. Attention, particularly among
high-technology and automotive manufacturers in the south of Germany, has
switched from Spain, Portugal and Italy to low-cost countries such as
Czechoslovakia.
Despite the optimism, however, many employers recognised they would face
increased price competition from other EC companies, and felt disadvantaged
by Germany's high wage costs, company taxation and the burdens of meeting
the country's strict environmental standards.
Wage costs in east Germany last year soared to 31 per cent of companies'
sales, compared with 20 per cent in the west, the IW economics institute,
Cologne, said yesterday.

</HEADLINE>

   AMSTERDAM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AMSTERDAM'S city council voted last night by a large majority to begin
drawing up a plan to reduce car traffic gradually in the city centre, bowing
to pressure generated by a controversial referendum held last month.
The 45-member council approved a motion calling for action that will go some
way towards satisfying voters who, by a slim majority, supported a radical
cut in the volume of traffic.
Opponents of deep cuts had argued against heeding the results of the
non-binding referendum, saying the low voter turnout of just 27 per cent had
nullified the results, which showed 52.9 per cent in favour of a drastic
curtailment.
The traffic proposals, to be drawn up over the next few months, are likely
to fall well short of the referendum's call for a halving of the 23,000
available parking spaces in the long term and introduction of a system of
regulating car access to the congested centre.
Proposals are expected to include the introduction of 'ride-sharing' taxis,
the allocation of sites for new parking garages, and a greater emphasis on
bicycle paths and pedestrian zones, as well as reductions in parking spaces.
Mr Roel van Duijn, a member of the 'Green Amsterdam' environmentalist party
and a prime force behind the the referendum, called for further measures,
including 'banning cars from streets wherever there are primary schools so
children can play outside'.

EUROPE'S three leading computer makers - Olivetti, Bull and Siemens-Nixdorf
 -have agreed to co-operate in developing large computer networks for public
sector bodies in the European Community, writes Haig Simonian in Milan. They
have set up Trans European Information Systems (TEIS) as a first step to
developing projects for compatible information systems in Europe based on
common system and software applications.
The aim of the TEIS venture is to enable the three companies to offer
compatible solutions to European public sector agencies. These agencies will
have to work increasingly closely with the coming of a single market and
steps towards political union.
The potential users include government ministries and agencies responsible
for cross-border issues such as immigration, health and social security, or
environmental monitoring.
The three companies have set up research laboratories at Pozzuoli near
Naples, as well as in Munich and Paris. The Naples unit will check whether
hardware and software from the three companies is inter-operable.

FT  16 APR 92 / Russia opts for crisis over chaos
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
In nine days of stormy debate in the Russian Congress of People's Deputies,
the country's post-communist legislators issued a stern warning by passing
an uncompromising resolution effectively crippling President Boris Yeltsin's
radical economic reforms. However, by yesterday the Congress conservatives
had climbed down and adopted a declaration giving Mr Yeltsin and his
reformers full support. John Lloyd in Moscow analyses the outcome
THE CLOSING moments of the current session of the Russian Congress of
People's Deputies may produce surprises yet, and it certainly would be a
surprise if the delegates demonstrated a collective will and capacity to
injure the government seriously, so long as that government is supported by
President Boris Yeltsin.
This does not mean that no harm has been done.
The cost of the concessions that the president and the government made
before and during this parliament has yet to be presented. But it looks
high: energy price rises to be postponed, taxes lowered, social security and
other benefits raised, industry given Rbs200bn in credits.
The international financial institutions are worried, but western
politicians are saying nothing critical while the congress remains in
session. Mr Donald Mulford, the US assistant treasury secretary who saw
First Deputy Prime Minister Yegor Gaidar on Tuesday, said, and then only
reluctantly and sotto voce, that the measures 'may' have an adverse effect
on the budget deficit. Patently, they will.
Now, however, political survival is what counts, and this congress session
has shown that Mr Yeltsin remains unchallengeable so far, even though there
is a majority of deputies opposed to government policy.
The government's offer of resignation was obviously a tactical ploy but
still enough to whip the congress into line.
It dropped its insistence that a new government be presented by May, leaving
the government free to pursue what Mr Gaidar said would be 'rather tough
restrictions' on credits, together with high interest rates. In one sense,
this parliament should have been able to exert its will: it reflects, though
it does not represent, the frustrations of a people undergoing economic
miseries and uncertainties, and reflects them because the deputies have
local knowledge of their constituents' sufferings.
However, the deputies cannot fully represent them because they hold their
seats on the old system of election, with many essentially nominated by the
defunct Communist Party and the institutions such as trade unions which were
the party's creatures. They are thus inhibited and ultimately fearful of
pressing criticism to the point where they would win and then have to take
responsibility for a programme. The more astute probably know they have no
workable plan, nor any competent nominees for a new cabinet.
The parliament was crippled by its contradictions. The deputies most willing
to deploy a populist critique of the pro-market reforms were those least
able to claim a firm mandate, while the deputies who had come in on a
democratic ticket were bound by loyalty to 'their' government and president.
This leaves much of the electorate disenfranchised: the mass of people have
experienced few benefits from reform but still have no credible
representatives and cling to Mr Yeltsin as a figure of authority, albeit a
harsh one.
The opposition was further emasculated by the behaviour and personalities of
two of the men closest to the presidential seat.
Mr Alexander Rutskoi, the vice-president, said before the Congress that he
was not going to repeat his strongly expressed critique of the cabinet, and
he kept his word.
Mr Ruslan Khasbulatov, the parliamentary speaker, naturally played a larger
role: he has been, ex officio, the producer of this drama. No 'speaker' in
the western sense, he directs barbs from his dais to wherever he wishes,
especially at the government, the members of which he called 'little boys
who get scared," trying by their resignation threat to blackmail parliament.
He has dismissed the IMF as both unwanted and unable to deliver the money
promised by the Group of Seven. He was 'sorry' for the US if it had no
better policy than to support Mr Gaidar.
Yet, in the end, he pledged loyalty to Mr Yeltsin because he cannot operate
outside the president's circle and thus at best, or worst, can only seek to
hobble the government, not destroy it.
Mr Yeltsin has had, in Mr Gaidar, a more determined opponent than he could
have thought before the congress. Mr Gaidar's four months in office has seen
an extraordinary assumption of political maturity.
He has grown from being only an academic-cum-journalist into a statesman,
from a novice politician who carelessly said he would only be in office a
few months to a fighter for his cause.
Mr Yeltsin, absent from the Congress since Saturday in another typical
retreat from engagements and visibility, has had his status confirmed rather
than enhanced. Like Mr Gorbachev before him, he remains dominant in part
because he does not directly oppose any of the main characters or forces
below him, even when they are fighting each other. Thus Mr Khasbulatov's
parliamentarians, Mr Rutskoi's supporters in the military-industrial complex
and Mr Gaidar's cabinet can all see in him 'their' leader.
This has its risks, as Mr Gorbachev's career shows, but Mr Yeltsin does not
yet have to struggle with an opponent as determined as he himself was in
opposing Mr Gorbachev. And, though many of the Russian Federation's
republics and regions are straining for greater autonomy, even independence,
they are not yet to be compared with the Baltics or Ukraine.
Little actual progress has been made. The main new measure to be put before
the congress - a new Russian constitution - has not been tabled and may not
be, or, if it is, will be unlikely to secure the required two-thirds
majority. The old, Soviet-period constitution remains in force, much
amended, and may have to serve for some time.
But the government, and something called reform, remains. Chaos is averted,
and Russian society and its government can turn back with relief to mere
crisis.

THE US yesterday launched a fresh diplomatic effort to end the fighting in
Bosnia-Hercegovina, where fighting broke out again despite a ceasefire.
Mr James Baker, the secretary of state, telephoned the foreign ministers of
Britain, France, Germany and Portugal, the current president of the European
Community, to discuss how to end the fighting.
A State Department spokeswoman described the conduct of the Serbian
leadership in Belgrade and Serbian armed forces in Bosnia as 'completely
outside the bounds of civilised behaviour.'
In London Mr Douglas Hurd, the British foreign secretary, said: 'It's not
acceptable that Yugoslav army or Serb irregulars or indeed Croatian
irregulars should intervene and provoke a civil war.'
Mr Cyrus Vance, the United Nations special envoy, yesterday said the UN
would not extend its peacekeeping operations to Bosnia-Hercegovina,
Mr Vance, who arrived in Belgrade for another round of peace talks, appealed
to Bosnian leaders to respect the ceasefire.
'The situation in Bosnia-Hercegovina is very, very serious and is causing us
great concern. It is therefore essential that all the parties live up to the
ceasefire agreement. War is not the answer. It will be ruinous to all sides
and nobody should think that he or she can gain a one-sided advantage.'
Mr Vance said the UN did not have enough troops to undertake peace-keeping
operations in Bosnia as well as Croatia. Nor is there any UN mandate to
operate in Bosnia.
Clashes yesterday were reported in Sarajevo, the capital of Bosnia, in
Bosanski Brod, on Bosnia's northern frontier with Croatia, and in Mostar, in
the south.
The federal army said it had secured Visegrad, a predominantly Moslem town
in south-east Bosnia. The fighting which has left dozens dead and forced
100,000 people to flee.

FT  16 APR 92 / City fraud squad arrests investment company director
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Kenneth Renton, a director of Wentworth Investment Services, was arrested
at Heathrow yesterday by the City of London Fraud Squad, in connection with
the alleged disappearance of Pounds 4.5m from four investors, according to
Fimbra, the financial advisers' self-regulatory body.
The City fraud squad said Mr Renton was helping police with their inquiries.
Fimbra said that from yesterday it had suspended authorisation for Mr Renton
to conduct investment business and the authorisation of Wentworth Investment
Services. Other Wentworth directors were said to have been unaware that Mr
Renton had been conducting investment business for the four investors.
Fimbra called in the squad on Tuesday after hearing from four investors that
Mr Renton had not been seen at his office at King Street in the City since
Friday. The four had tried to obtain refunds from him.
Mr Renton was a senior fund manager with the Tyndall banking and fund
management group during the 1970s. In 1975 he helped the Bank of England
sell its controlling interest in Mount Charlotte Investments, the hotels
group, which the Bank had taken over from Slater Walker.
Mr Renton became a director of Mount Charlotte shortly after and only
resigned in October 1990 after the company was taken over by Brierley
Investments.
A review of the firm's records did not reveal records of the four investors
seeking refunds and Fimbra called in the police. Fimbra is trying to
determine if other investors placed funds with Wentworth Investment Services
or with Mr Renton personally.
Wentworth was admitted to Fimbra in March 1989 under so-called category
three, allowing it to advise upon and arrange transactions in any investment
business, so long as the investment was in readily realiseable investments
through a regulated dealer. Mr Renton was also listed as a director of
Waverley Fund Management, unit trust and investment managers.

FT  16 APR 92 / Major will focus on housing, schools andinner cities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN MAJOR yesterday set housing, education and inner cities as priority
areas for the first legislative session of the new parliament as he
continued his wide-ranging ministerial reshuffle.
As the Labour party's deputy leadership race expanded into a four-candidate
contest which threatens to exacerbate its internal divisions, the new
cabinet met for the first time since the election. It started work on a
parliamentary programme that will last until the autumn of 1993.
The programme is almost certain to include a housing bill, incorporating
'rights to improve', giving compensation to council tenants improving their
homes, and 'rents to mortgages' schemes which will allow council tenants to
take a part share in their homes.
'Commonhold' legislation would also give residential leaseholders in blocks
of flats the right to acquire the freehold of the block at the market rate.
Mr Michael Howard, the new environment secretary, is also pushing for
legislation on inner cities, possibly to establish an Urban Regeneration
Agency to develop derelict land in inner cities.
The prime minister wants an emphasis on his Citizen's Charter proposals and
on education in the next parliament but legislative proposals have yet to be
agreed.
Other measures in the next parliament will be bills which failed to complete
their parliamentary stages before the election. They include an asylum bill
to tighten immigration procedures and a new finance bill. Mr David Mellor,
the new national heritage secretary, will unveil legislation for a national
lottery.
Also in the programme will be a short bill allowing the government to start
working with private sector advisers on the privatisation of British Rail -
although the form of the sell-off has still to be decided.
Mr Major shuffled the whips department last night. He appointed Mr David
Heathcoat-Amory, the former junior energy minister, as deputy chief whip.
Earlier Mr Major announced moves of senior civil servants which spread
former Treasury mandarins still further across Whitehall - including to the
most senior job at the new national heritage department.
He has also appointed a new principal private secretary at Downing Street
and replaced the soon-to-retire Sir Percy Cradock as foreign affairs adviser
by Sir Rodric Braithwaite, Britain's ambassador in Moscow.
Meanwhile the race for Labour's deputy leadership was joined last night by
Mrs Margaret Beckett, shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, and Mrs Ann
Clwyd, overseas development spokesman. Mr John Prescott, transport
spokesman, and Mr Bryan Gould are also candidates.
Mrs Beckett appears the favourite to win as deputy leader, along with Mr
John Smith, who is running for the leadership.

FT  16 APR 92 / High street sales decline in March
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HIGH STREET sales declined in March reversing seven successive months of
year-on-year growth, the Confederation of British Industry said yesterday.
The CBI monthly distributive trades survey showed that retail sales volumes
in March were not only lower than a year ago but were also down on the
previous month.
The drop in sales since February was unexpected and contradicted recent
tentative signs of economic recovery. However, Mr Nigel Whittaker, chairman
of the CBI's distributive trades panel, said that retailers expected sales
to improve now that the election was over.
Several factors distorted the year-on-year comparison for March, the CBI
said, notably the value added tax increase introduced after the 1991 Budget.
This gave a particular boost to sales of electrical and household goods in
March last year. The CBI attributed the monthly decline to election
uncertainties.
Before this survey, the CBI had been reporting a modest recovery in the high
street. Yesterday Mr Whittaker said he expected the improvement to resume in
April adding to patchy indications that the UK economy was on the brink of a
recovery.
Earlier this week, the Central Statistical Office released figures which
showed that manufacturing output increased by 1.1 per cent in February.
A survey of British purchasing managers two weeks ago indicated a revival of
manufacturing activity in March compared with February.
Meanwhile, Cullens, the food retailing chain, reported sales for the week
ending April 12 were the highest weekly total for 18 months.
Clothing and shoe retailers reported volumes in March down on a year ago as
price discounting, which boosted sales in January and February, ended.

FT  16 APR 92 / Japan hits at US and Europe over world trade: Confidential
letters call for swift action to end Gatt row
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON and DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO, BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN has sent unusually tough letters to Washington and Brussels expressing
concern that the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations is stalled
because the European Community and US have not fulfilled their obligations.
The Japanese government has become increasingly frustrated by the failure of
the EC and US to honour Uruguay Round proposal deadlines under the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. This frustration has finally surfaced in the
two confidential letters sent by Mr Michio Watanabe, the foreign minister
and deputy prime minister.
In the past, Tokyo has preferred to sit on the sidelines while the EC and US
argue over agricultural trade and industrial tariffs. The government now
believes that the multilateral round has reached a 'critical phase' and that
Brussels and Washington must act quickly.
Japan has therefore joined a growing number of interested parties expressing
their disquiet that resolution of the round, which will now miss its Easter
deadline, is proving so protracted.
More than 100 chief executives worldwide signed a letter published in the
Financial Times yesterday. In it they argued that 'the continuing stalemate
over the trade negotiations has contributed to the deterioration of the
economic climate and the postponement of many business initiatives'.
In Brussels, ahead of an EC-US summit in Washington next Wednesday, the
European Commission moved yesterday to damp hopes of a breakthrough in the
five-year-old round.
The meeting is between President George Bush, Mr Jacques Delors, the
Commission president, and Mr Anibal Cavaco Silva, prime minister of
Portugal, which currently holds the Community presidency. It is widely seen
as the last chance to conclude the round this year and give a much-needed
boost to world economic growth.
A spokesman for Mr Delors said that 'up to now, nothing indicates that there
will be an agreement'.
Mr Watanabe, in a letter to Mrs Carla Hills, US trade representative,
expressed his disappointment that Washington is seeking many exemptions in
services trade negotiations and failed to meet a deadline last month for the
submission of a list of industrial products and suggested tariff reductions.
Japan, one of about 15 countries to meet the deadline, submitted a 450-page
document, while the US furnished only a few pages and said qualitative
reductions were still under consideration.
The foreign minister lamented that the US had not submitted its list
apparently because bilateral negotiations with the EC are yet to be
completed. He regretted that the EC was using the same excuse to justify its
non-compliance.
A senior Japanese negotiator explained that Mr Watanabe was irritated
because the US and EC have the expertise to compile the tariff lists. He
believes their failure has set a poor example for developing countries for
which the process is far more exacting.
'It is six weeks since the deadline passed and still they have not produced
a list. How long are we supposed to wait? What sort of signal does this send
to other countries?' the official said.
In a separate letter to Mr Frans Andriessen, Commission vice-president, Mr
Watanabe expressed concern about the absence of detailed industrial tariff
proposals and about the EC seeking exemptions to liberalised trade in
services, particularly international shipping.

FT  16 APR 92 / Libyan flights blocked as UN sanctions begin
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
LIBYA challenged the United Nations air embargo imposed yesterday by
proceeding with scheduled flights to destinations in Europe and the Middle
East - but its aircraft were turned back.
At the same time the US, Japan and a number of European countries said they
would expel Libyan diplomats in accordance with UN sanctions. In Tripoli,
the Libyan news agency Jana said 'reciprocal measures' had begun against
states imposing sanctions. It did not give details, but it is likely western
diplomats in the Libyan capital will be sent home in retaliation.
The sanctions, passed on March 31, follow Libya's refusal to hand over two
men indicted in the west on suspicion of planting the bomb that destroyed
Pan Am flight 103 over Lockerbie in 1988.
Libya's neighbour, Egypt, became the first Arab country to enforce the air
embargo when it informed Tripoli that Egyptian airspace was closed. A
foreign ministry official in Cairo said Egypt 'respects international
legality'.
Libyan Arab Airlines flights were also turned back by Tunisia and
Switzerland, which has implemented sanctions even though it is not a member
of the UN. Two Italian air force jets were scrambled to deter a Libyan
Boeing 727 from entering Italy's airspace.
Japan's announcement that it would expel Libyan diplomats was followed by
similar statements from the US, Sweden, Italy and France.
A reduction in Libya's 16-member UN delegation in New York is to be
announced soon. The US has no diplomatic links with Tripoli.
However, the UK said that two Libyan envoys in Britain, working from the
Saudi Arabian embassy, would remain in their posts - at least while two
British diplomats still operated from the Italian embassy in Tripoli.
UN Resolution 748 bans the international movement of Libyan Arab Airlines,
bars the shipment of arms to Libya and requires a reduction in Libyan
diplomatic representation.
Under the sanctions, Libya is also required to turn over four men allegedly
involved in the bombing of a UTA jet in 1989 over Niger, and to take
concrete steps to disassociate itself from terrorism.
Hours after sanctions came into effect the UN Security Council set up a
committee to oversee implementation and deal with requests for exemptions.
These are expected mainly to allow foreign workers to fly out of Libya.
Resolution 748 empowers the sanctions committee to allow flights 'on grounds
of significant humanitarian need'.
The UK and US stressed that the sanctions resolution was mandatory. 'The
Council means business,' warned Sir David Hannay, UK ambassador to the UN,
noting that governments had until May 15 to report on measures taken to
implement the embargo.
Mr Douglas Hurd, the UK foreign secretary, interviewed on BBC radio, said
continued Libyan intransigence could prompt the US, Britain and France into
considering an oil embargo against Tripoli.
'That's obviously something that could be considered for the future,' he
said, though Foreign Office officials said such an embargo was not yet under
discussion.
The streets of the Libyan capital were reported to be calm but Libya's
official media maintained a barrage of criticism against the west.
Libyan Radio accused the US, Britain and France of 'renewing their colonial
attempt' to bring down the regime. It accused the west of seeking to 'make
up for the failure' of the US bombing raid six years ago, when the US
targeted Colonel Muammer Gad-affi's headquarters in an apparent attempt to
eliminate him.

FT  16 APR 92 / Survey of Swindon (11): Down to earth study - Natural
Environmental Research Council
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
LAST week's announcement that the ozone layer above northern Europe shrank
by 20 per cent in the first two months of the year was a tribute to the
international co-operation of 300 scientists working in 17 different
counties.
The scientists, members of European Arctic Stratospheric Ozone Experiment
(Easoe), established that conditions over the north Atlantic, Europe and New
England were so bad in early February, ozone was possibly being lost at the
rate of 1 per cent a day. One calculation suggests that for every 1 per cent
drop in the ozone screen, there could be a 2 per cent increase in
non-melanoma skins cancers, adding an extra Pounds 7m in treatment costs to
the NHS in Britain.
The experiment was also a tribute to the research policy of the
Swindon-based Natural Environmental Research Council (NERC), whose research
institute, the British Antarctic Survey, co-ordinated the investigation in
conjunction with the US space agency NASA. The discovery by NERC's
scientists of the ozone hole above the Antarctic in 1985 led to the Montreal
Protocol of 1989 on phasing out CFCs.
NERC is one of five research councils funded by the Department of Education
and Science. With a budget this year of Pounds 170m and a staff of 2,600
employed in 16 institutes and research units across the UK, it is charged
with the basic task of discovering how the earth's environment, which is now
known to be a network of interlocking natural systems, works.
Other projects include the construction of a new Pounds 40 Oceanographic
Centre at Southampton, and a new Geosciences Centre at Keyworth, near
Nottingham.
Its marine scientists have just completed an ambitious survey of the North
Sea, with a view to constructing a model of how its water quality changes
with the seasons. This has important political and economic implications.
The EC is planning to ban this dumping before the end of the decade. The
government believes it may be possible to dump sewage sludge in the right
place and the right time without doing environmental damage.
It is also investigating changing land use in Britain using satellite
sensing, land classification and on-the-ground sampling. This has already
established for example that some 25,000 miles of hedgerow disappeared
between 1978 and 1984. By comparing these figures with changes in flora and
fauna population changes, it is hoped to obtain a total picture of the
ecosystem.
NERC's work on analysing the biological rather than the chemical
constituents of water has already yielded a very valuable method of
monitoring water quality. A diagnostic computer programme, Rivpacs, designed
for use by water authorities, analyses the biological community which lives
in the water from which it is able to measure the levels of nitrates and
cocktail effects of impurities.
Rivpacs is just one example of NERC's increasing involvement in finding
practical answers to environmental problems. A quarter of NERC's income now
comes from research commissioned by a variety of public bodies and
industrial sectors in the UK and abroad. In the years ahead, it is clearly
set to grow.

FT  16 APR 92 / Survey of Swindon (12): First stop in the West - The town is
seeking ways to encourage tourism
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBIN REEVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LIKE MANY towns of comparable size and importance, Swindon has begun to seek
ways of encouraging tourism.
Several schemes are afoot. The local authority, Thamesdown Borough Council,
has joined forces with other Wiltshire councils to implement a Pounds
300,000 Tourism Development Action Programme over three years. It has just
agreed a new corporate image, 'Swindon - First Stop in the West Country',
and is about to fund a hotels' study over the next few months to see what
can be done to improve occupancy.
In practice, Swindon is not doing badly in the tourism market. Recently
published figures, covering spending in 1990, indicated that it accounted
for some Pounds 330m or 18 per cent of tourism in the West Country and
Wiltshire.
Even so, the council believes there is scope for improvement. 'We don't
expect people to come to Swindon for a fortnight's holiday. But we have a
good hotels' infrastructure and we think more people can be persuaded to
stop on their way to and from the West Country and visit attractions in the
vicinity,' explains Mr Keith Duesbury, Swindon economic development manager
with special responsibility for tourism.
The town also recognises that it must have good attractions and that one
tourism asset which it is not yet exploiting to the full is its unique
railway heritage.
There is a museum celebrating Swindon's historic role as the 'Great Western
Railway town', set in the heart of Brunel's railway village, itself a fine
example of model housing from the Victorian era.
The local authority recently started advertising the museum and as a result
it attracts some 40,000 visitors a year. But the council would like to make
far more of its fame as a railway town and create a more extensive
attraction in collaboration with Tarmac, owners and developers of the Brel
railway workshops site. Hitherto, it has not had the financial resources to
do so.
On the other hand, Swindon recently received confirmation of some news of a
development which will make the town, in some ways, heritage capital of
England. The Royal Commission on the Historic Monuments of England (RCHME)
announced in February it had reached agreement with Tarmac to relocate its
headquarters and archive records from London to Churchward, the former
British engineering works site. RCHME will occupy a 19th and 20th century
grade II listed building known as 'The Chief Mechanical Engineer's Office'
and also build alongside an environmentally-controlled archive store
containing a unique record of all the available evidence of England's past,
from pre-history top modern times.
The RCHME was established in 1908. Its central role is to maintain a record
of England's heritage by identifying all 'historic constructions' and
ensuring there is an adequate inventory and record of what survives.
Half its 200 staff are occupied with recording evidence on the ground, the
other half on building up its archive and increasingly sophisticated data
base.
RCHME maintains the National Buildings Record, a National Archaeological
Record and a National Library of Air Photographs. The Air Photography Unit,
headed by Dr Rowan Whimster, has already moved to temporary accommodation in
Swindon as an advanced guard for the main move in 1994.
Aerial photography is still a rich source of archaeological discoveries - an
exceptionally dry summer will make visible as many as 1,000 previously
invisible archaeological remains, ranging from a barrow to a large neolithic
village.
The unit also has responsibility for more than 3m aerial photographs of
England dating back to 1947-48 when the Royal Air Force was given the job of
systematically photographing the whole of Britain from the air for the first
time. The Ordnance Survey subsequently used this survey to produce 6
inches-to-the-mile scale maps of Britain.
Between them, RCHME's records provide a gazetteer of all identified sites of
historic interest in England and an archive of plans, drawings, and
photographs to support them. This unique national collection will be housed
in the new archive store to be built at Churchward. Its design will be, to
say the least, unusual.
Internally, to guard against risks of accidental damage, it will have no
water pipes or electricity cables. It will also be divided into sections
with different temperature and humidity environments to suit the particular
material being stored, and each section will have its own fire break.
Externally, the store presents an architectural challenge. The RCHME is
anxious not to produce a pastiche but a modern building which fits
harmoniously into the surroundings. That said, however it can have no
windows.
How big a tourist attraction might the new RCHME facility become? Visitors
to the RCHME's present archives total fewer than 10,000 a year. The
organisation is also experimenting with a prototype computer imaging system
which could provide users with the ability to tap into the archive data base
from afar. And obviously there is a physical limit to the number of visitors
using an archive store.
On the other hand, Dr Whimster stresses, the organisation does want to
increase public usage. To this end it has just appointed a director of
marketing to develop new services and products and to ensure this unique
English national resource is used more frequently and efficiently.

FT  16 APR 92 / Survey of Swindon (10): High on the mailing list - Swindon
has a large share of the UK's distribution business
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Post Office's bulk handling centre in Swindon deals with between 3m and
6.5m items each week or an average of more than 230m items a year, one of
the highest throughputs of any bulk mail office in Europe.
This is the measure of Swindon's big share in the growing business of direct
mail order marketing and distribution.
Well-known local companies which are heavy users of the bulk distribution
service include Reader's Digest, W H Smith - the headquarters of the
company's retail operations are located in the town - and a number of book
clubs.
But the company responsible perhaps more than any other for the development
of Swindon as a bulk distribution centre is the Ralton Group, one of the
UK's top five companies specialising in direct mail marketing. Soon after
Ralton's relocation to Swindon from London in the late 1970s, the Post
Office decided it had no option but to establish a bulk handling depot
nearby to handle the volume of business.
Every year, the overwhelming majority of the UK's 23m households are sent a
TV licence demand and many of them also have to be sent a reminder. Some
2.3m shareholders in British Gas must be sent copies of the annual report
and accounts to arrive on a date which complies with stock exchange rules.
These are just two routine items of business for Ralton. With a core staff
of 150, and another 100 casuals who can be called upon if required, Ralton
has built up its business to the point where it inserts more than 150m items
into paper or polythene envelopes every year and has the biggest polythene
wrap mail operation in the country.
Ralton's operation is multi-faceted. It is geared to handle everything from
the simple insertion of a brochure into a Sunday newspaper colour magazine,
to a complicated mail out, and running a complete direct marketing campaign.
Individual clients pick and mix to the precise service they require, though,
in practice, the minimum mail-out tends to be 50,000 envelopes. Below that
figure Ralton's service ceases to be cost effective.
The privatisation boom of the 1980s has been particularly beneficial to the
company's growth, enabling Ralton to make the most of its long experience of
handling the distribution of company reports and accounts. Mr James
Arrowsmith, sales and marketing director of Ralton, reckons the group
handles around 25 per cent of the report and account mailings of PLCs which
have more than 50,000 shareholders.
Stemming from its direct mailing experience, the group also knows a
considerable amount about list management and list broking for
business-to-business and consumer direct mailings.
Targeting potential customers using direct mail techniques is becoming a
very sophisticated business, though, Mr Arrowsmith stresses, there is still
plenty of scope for development, bearing in mind US experience.
The average US household receives 205 direct mail shots annually.
The comparable figure for Europe is 46 direct mailings a year, an average
which Ralton is hoping to increase greatly by a collaborative link-up which
it recently organised with comparable direct mail companies on the
Continent.
Euro Net, as it is called, links up independent direct marketing companies
in the main European Community member countries plus Norway, Sweden and
Switzerland and offers companies or organisations the opportunity to run
pan-European campaigns, yet deal with a single organisation.
However, Ralton sees as the most important area of growth in the 1990s, the
development of the group's telemarketing and product fulfilment services.
An ever-increasing number of companies are turning to direct response
advertising in newspapers and on television as the most cost-effective way
of reaching their potential customers. Ralton is geared to handle all
aspects of this business, from dealing with the telephone responses stemming
from TV, radio and press campaigns, market research, the generation of sales
leads, the building and refining of mailing lists, and sales promotion
services.
On the fulfilment side, it is not only geared to accepting and collating
orders for that holiday brochure or special coffee jug offer, but to
dispatching the orders as well.
Because of its confidence in the growth in this side of its business, Ralton
has installed a new telephone system in its telemarketing department which
allows each telephone number to receive 30 incoming calls at a time.
Mr Arrowsmith explains why. 'More and more companies are starting to use
direct response advertising. In five years time I am confident our
Telemarketing Division will be employing a staff of 100 which compares with
20 staff at present.'
The Post Office, too, is gearing up for increased business. The bulk
handling centre in Swindon has been put under the control of Royal Mail
Streamline, a new subsidiary of the Royal Mail with 16 offices around the UK
and its own independent distribution network to compete against the likes of
Federal Express and TNT and avoid the normal Royal Mail network becoming
overloaded.
Bulk service users have the option of either delivering their mail already
sorted and stamped or using what the Post Office describes as its deferred
service, available at a discount.
Mr John Bridgeman, the service liaison manager, explains: 'The customer
delivers his mail early and gives us a target delivery date. We then prepare
the mail for dispatch during quiet periods. By using our staff in this way,
we are able to even out the peaks and troughs in delivery.'

FT  16 APR 92 / Survey of Swindon (9): Nerve centre for advance into Europe
 -Profile: Motorola
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBIN REEVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MOTOROLA, the US-owned electronics and telecommunications manufacturing
group, has made Swindon the nerve centre of its drive to profit from the
next advance in mobile communications. This, in essence, will make the
mobile telephone internationally transportable. Calls on an international
handset can be made anywhere in Europe and billed back home.
The mobile cellular communications systems established in many European
countries during the 1980s - such as Cellnet in the UK - are based upon
analogue radio technology for which different national standards operate. As
a result, a cellular telephone from one country will not usually work in
another.
But for the next generation of mobile telephones, most European countries
have agreed a common standard based upon digital radio technology.
The new pan-European GSM (global system of mobile communications) standard,
as well as allowing the user to roam abroad, also offers better speech
quality and supports more subscribers for a given allocation of the radio
spectrum.
Motorola in Swindon, led by Mr David Hughes, general manager Europe, is
charged with carrying forward this new advance while also continuing to
service the requirements of its analogue customer base. Swindon has overall
management responsibility for developing the new GSM pan-European market and
also manufactures the radio frequency base stations required to pick up the
signal. More than Pounds 30m has been invested in the Swindon site for the
project.
An interesting development also being master-minded from Swindon is
Motorola's exploitation of the new markets in eastern Europe. Former Soviet
bloc countries are still using landline copper wire telephone systems.
Motorola has been offering a number of these countries proven analogue radio
technology as a rapid way of modernising their telecommunications at
reasonable cost.
While it may make sense, on the face of it, to leapfrog and adopt the GSM
standard straight away, the radio frequencies required are invariably held
by the military. Also, for some of these countries, digital radio technology
is still subject to Cold War trade restrictions.

THE JOKE about defence-oriented companies facing the 'threat of peace' began
in the mid-1980s soon after the coming to power of Soviet President
Gorbachev. But at the time, it was no laughing matter for one of Swindon's
leading manufacturers, Raychem, a US-owned materials technology company,
heavily dependent upon military procurement for much of its business.
Thanks to a sustained drive to find new markets and to reduce its costs
base, Raychem recently turned the corner - its sales to the civilian market
now exceed those to the military, demonstrating that there can be a peace
dividend for defence industry companies.
The turnaround has been achieved with minimum jobs losses among employees.
Some 70 out of 1,200 jobs in Swindon were cut two years ago and there were
about 800 cutbacks worldwide out of a total workforce of 11,000, effected
mainly via early retirement and voluntary redundancy. But otherwise, the
company has been riding out the recession with relative ease, thanks to
buoyant export markets which now account for 70 per cent of the company's
sales.
Raychem's expertise is in materials science in general and radiated
materials in particular. Many of its products are based on the discovery,
made in the 1950s, that materials bombarded with radiation create links
between the molecules which give it 'elastic memory'; that is, the ability
to return to the shape in which they were radiated when heated.
Raychem was the first company to take a commercial interest in the
phenomenon and has been running with it ever since producing a big range of
products and applications which last year resulted in worldwide sales of
Dollars l26bn.
Raychem in Swindon operates on two sites. One is dedicated to wire and cable
and research and development for the company's five European manufacturing
centres, and the other to Thermofit tubing, shrinkable tubing for wiring and
environmental seals.
In seeking to develop civilian markets for its expertise, Swindon
concentrated initially upon small-size, lightweight wire insulations for the
aircraft manufacturing industry which, in turn, led to low fire hazard
technology.
Many military applications can be switched. A tank harness (wiring system),
for instance, can be adapted to a civilian aircraft. However, the
specification for a harness for commercial use is very different from one
for the military. 'The thinner you can make the insulation, the better the
aircraft engineer likes it,' Mr Jim Webster, the divisional manager,
explains.
The demands of the civilian aerospace industry opened the way for orders for
new wire and cabling products for the Channel Tunnel rail carriages and
motor vehicle manufacturers. Raychem was recently awarded A grading by
Renault and Citroen, a quality standard which covers all aspects of a
company's operations and which will become a compulsory requirement for
component suppliers to these French motor manufacturers from 1993.
Similar technology has been used to develop a wide range of environmental
closures Raychem reckons to be the biggest single supplier in the world of
cable accessories; its products have replaced solder, for example, in many
cabling applications.
Environmental considerations have imposed themselves in the company's
dealings with Volkswagen. The German motor manufacturer is interested in how
environmentally-friendly a component will be, once it comes to the end of
its useful life and has to be discarded.
However, successes would not have been possible had Raychem not also been
addressing costs. In the manufacturing areas, the costs base has been
reduced by 20 per cent, mainly by changes in the way things are done. The
old hierarchical management structures have gone. In their place is a
flattened management structure in which staff have been empowered and
trained to work as a team. The net result is that the Swindon plant now
produces more cable in two shifts than it used to produce in three.
Japanese-style Total Quality Management and Just-in-Time techniques have
obviously played their part. So, too, has a big emphasis on quality
improvement training and vocational education.
As a measure of its importance within the company, Raychem recently received
a national award for a technical operator training scheme aimed at people on
the shop floor who had learned everything and whom the senior management
felt could do more. It has also just received another award for language
training for its staff who between them put in a total of 3,500 hours of
learning a year.
Raychem has also become a partner company in Warwick University's
manufacturing faculty which involves 15 members of staff spending one week
in six in Warwick training as project leaders. In short, for Raychem in
Swindon, the end of the Cold War is already paying a handsome 'peace
dividend'.

FT  16 APR 92 / Survey of Swindon (7): New stimulus for manufacturing -
Profile: Honda
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBIN REEVES

<TEXT>
ANYONE who believes the closure of Swindon's railway workshops was the end
of Swindon as a serious manufacturing centre needs to drive around the
town's north-eastern bypass. There, dominating the skyline near the village
of South Marston is the massive new factory of Honda of the UK Manufacturing
(HUM), which is now tooling up for an expansion from engine production into
full motor car assembly.
Far from having abandoned manufacturing, Swindon has become one of the key
participants in the revival of the British motor industry being spearheaded
by Japanese motor manufacturers.
Last November's announcement by Honda and the Rover Group that they were
extending the joint manufacturing relationship which first began in 1979
into the 1990s was particularly good news for the town. It revealed that
Honda had decided to produce a second model at Swindon. It also killed off
any lingering speculation, in the wake of British Aerospace's reluctant
take-over of the British car manufacturer and the more difficult market for
motor manufacturers in Europe generally, that Honda might prefer to find a
new, more successful partner in continental Europe.
That had always looked ears ago, HUM and Rover purchased 20 per cent in each
other. Even so, Rover's body pressings plant at Swindon was very glad to
have confirmation that it will continue as Honda's main European supplier of
metal body panels.
Honda's growth in Swindon has been rapid. Spurning the lure of development
area grants and incentives, the Japanese motor manufacturer first
established a presence near the town in 1985.
Like Toyota in Derby, Honda was evidently offered its present 360-acre site
 -complete with an old wartime airfield for test driving vehicles - at a
price which it could not refuse. The local authority was instrumental in
obtaining planning permission.
Plans for the engine plant were unveiled in 1987 and that project came on
stream in 1989, producing 70,000 units in its first year. Today, the engine
plant is producing at the rate of more than 100,000 1.6 litre double
overhead cam engines a year, all of which go to Rover's Longbridge assembly
plant for installation in Rover's 200 and 400 models and (some 40,000 of
them) in the Honda Concerto. The Concerto is assembled by Rover at
Longbridge for Honda under sub-contract.
The new Swindon assembly plant is due to come on stream this autumn,
manufacturing 'Synchro', the code name given to Honda's first range of
UK-assembled 2-litre cars for the European market.
The initial output of Synchro is to be 50,000 units a year, increasing to
100,000 by the mid-1990s. Production of the second model, a successor to the
Concerto, will begin in August 1994. By early 1995, when the assembly plant
is due to move to full two-shift working, Honda expects to be employing
2,000 workers, or 'associates' as the company prefers to call them.
This figure compares with a total of 753 'associates' employed on the
Swindon site at present.
Even by Japanese standards, Honda is famous for the very strong emphasis
which it places as a company on team work and respect for the individual, Mr
Andrew Jones, the plant manager explains.
'Associates' are selected on the basis that they will work and develop
together; have never worked in the motor industry before; and that they
fully accept the participatory style of working for which Japanese-style
manufacturing is famous.
With the exception of a few specialist senior engineers and computer
personnel, Honda recruits all its staff locally and trains them in-house.
Three of the departmental managers began their careers on the shop floor.
Mr Jones is proud of what has already been achieved. The productivity of the
engine plant is high - 99.88 per cent of engines coming off the assembly
line achieve right first time firing. More than 50 teams are working in
Quality Circles on ideas which could make it even more productive. Other
ideas, already implemented, have saved thousands of pounds annually.
'On July I, 1990, I told staff I was cutting their working week from 39 to
37 hours - a reduction in productive time of 5.1 per cent. I asked them if
they could return it in increased productivity - and they did,' Mr Jones
said.
Given this kind of performance, Honda in Swindon is on course to become a
strong player in the European car market of the 1990s.
By all accounts car manufacturers in Germany, France and Italy are beginning
to worry whether they will be able to compete with the lean production
techniques of Japanese-owned motor manufacturing plants being established in
the UK.
Honda looks well set to compete in other ways. Its location makes good sense
in view of the relationship with Rover. It is only two miles from Rover's
body and pressings plant in Swindon, 30 miles from Cowley, and 80 miles from
Longbridge; and it is within easy reach of Heathrow. It is also close to the
M4 and M5 and to the ports of Bristol for imports and Southampton for
exports.

FT  16 APR 92 / Survey of Swindon (6): On the right track - Swindon has
achieved a balanced economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEWART DALBY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SWINDON has successfully diversified its economy away from the railways
which for most of this century was the town's biggest employer.
After the Second World War, some 14,000 people were employed by Great
Western Railways in Swindon. After nationalisation, there was a gradual
rundown in operations until 1986-87 when British Rail Engineering Ltd
(Brel), the last of the big railway employers in the town, closed down with
a loss of 2,000 jobs.
Swindon has made good these losses and created new jobs in four broadly
defined areas - manufacturing, finan-cial services, distribution and mail
order, and electronics.
Although Swindon has been trying to limit its reliance on manufacturing,
around 26 per cent of the workforce is still involved in this sector. This
is higher than the national average of just under 24 per cent, and much
higher than the average for the south-east, where some towns have 18 per
cent or less of their workforce in manufacturing.
Swindon has achieved a genuinely balanced economy. So successful has the
diversification been that two years ago companies were concerned about
possible labour shortages and the overheating of wages which could follow.
Late in 1989 unemployment fell to 2.5 per cent.
Even success stories are not immune from the recession. Over the past two
years male unemployment has shot up to 9.2 per cent and the female rate to
4.1 per cent.
Ms Lorelei Hunt, a senior economic development officer at the borough
council, says the high rates are due to two factors: the slump in
construction work, and the decisions by the big financial services groups
not to take on new staff.
She says: 'For most of the 1980s Swindon was like one big building site.
Now, if you walk around the town you would be pushed to find one crane
operating.
'Once building activity picks up it will quickly make a hole in the
unemployment figures.'
As for female unemploy-ment, the large financial services groups such as
Allied Dunbar and Nationwide expanded constantly throughout the 1980s. Many
of the people they took on were mothers returning to work, school-leavers,
or even part-time employees.
The female unemployment figure therefore represents a new jobless pool that
did not exist before the economic expansion of the 1980s.
It is not just the construction industry and the female workers joining dole
queues for the first time that has swelled the numbers of people unemployed.
Many manufacturing companies have slimmed down and shed workers.

FT  16 APR 92 / Survey of Swindon (4): Giants dominate economy - Two large
businesses make up the core of the town's financial services
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEWART DALBY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SWINDON'S role as a financial services centre rests largely on the presence
of two large concerns - insurance and personal finance group, Allied Dunbar,
and leading building society Nationwide, both of which have chosen the town
as the centre for providing a range of back-office services.
The advantages it can offer as a location have also resulted, however, in a
number of small- and medium-sized companies flooding into the town, and
these in turn have attracted a number of correspondingly small and
medium-sized legal and accountancy firms. Large hotels with conference
facilities have also been set up, the latest of which is the De Vere Hotel.
There is a Holiday Inn and it is possible that a Hilton hotel will be built.
There are also several property and employment agencies. Mr Nicholas Davies,
a senior audit manager at accountants Ernst &amp; Young and president of the
Swindon Chamber of Commerce, says: 'Enough medium-sized businesses have
established themselves in Swindon to ensure that there is enough work for
lots of smallish accountants and not just the big boys. But the really large
companies like Allied Dunbar tend to carry out a lot of services in house.'
Swindon is, moreover, close enough to London (55 minutes by train) for large
concerns to rely on legal and other financial services in the capital.
Allied Dunbar has its national headquarters in Swindon and employs 2,500
people in various buildings throughout the town. Nationwide don, another
2,000 in Northampton and has a small headquarters in London with about 100
people.
Both companies moved to Swindon in the early 1970s when white-collar
businesses began leaving London in earnest.
Improved communications meant it was possible for service companies to move
most so-called 'back-office functions' out of London and save considerably
on wage, rent and rates costs .
Mr Bernard Simpson, the technology director of Nationwide, says: 'When the
company started looking at the options in the early 1970s, Swindon seemed
the best bet. It was close to London. There were tremendous communications
not just with London but with the rest of the country. There was a supply of
labour available from the railways. These workers also had wives who
increasingly wanted to work. There were no other significant white-collar
employers around at the time. The local authority was extremely welcoming in
finding accommodation.'
Nationwide has grown strongly over the years. It has just completed a move
into new buildings on the outskirts of Swindon and vacated six offices in
the town centre.
Mr Simpson says: 'We moved because it suited us better to have everyone
under one roof. Also, we wanted to avail ourselves of the latest information
technology. Swindon has a very good technological environment.' Mr Simpson
adds that Swindon remains an ideal location for the company. 'We have always
been able to recruit and, more importantly, keep the staff we needed.'
The company, Mr Simpson says, has been hit by the recession but only to the
extent that it has stopped taking on new staff. The company has not had to
lay off people.
Allied Dunbar has a similar story to tell. Mr Bob Gill, corporate affairs
director, says: 'The founders of Allied Dunbar were with Abbey Life in the
early 1970s. They were in a hurry to set up the new company. They came upon
Swindon and it seemed ideal. It was convenient. It was close to London. But
there was this huge captive labour market. The borough council was very
helpful and welcoming.'
Allied Dunbar has expanded considerably. In 1975 there were 75 employees.
Now there are 2,500 people working for the company in Swindon.
Mr Gill says: 'We have never had trouble in finding new staff. We have a
good, stable workforce. Turnover is very low.'
Mr Gill adds that costs have remained well under control in Swindon. Office
rents are also reasonable.
Just as with Nationwide, the recession has slowed Allied Dunbar's
recruitment rate, but the company has not announced any redundancies.
'We are still doing well. The company made Pounds 121m profit last year,' he
says. This compares with Pounds 118m the year before.
Looking to the future, Mr Gill says: 'I suppose if there were to be another
boom, then we might find it difficult to recruit the people we need. Two
years ago shortages were beginning to appear in the local labour market. The
town had virtually reached full employment. On the other hand, increasing
automation means we would probably not have to take on new people at the
same rate as we used to. Anyway, shortage of labour is not a problem that we
or Swindon have to worry about at the moment.'
With these two big companies firmly established, it is unlikely that Swindon
will attract any other large financial services group. Nevertheless, there
are nearly 5,000 people employed in financial services which makes this
sector an important part of the town's economy.

FT  16 APR 92 / Survey of Swindon (2): Driving force loses steam - Council
answers claims that it has turned away from further growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEWART DALBY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THAMESDOWN has been a very enterprising authority council for a long time
and has been the main driving force behind the town's expansion. From 70,000
in the 1950s, the population has more than doubled to 178,000 today.
After 30 years of active growth, however, there have been some signs more
recently of a slowing down and of some uncertainty over the scope and rate
at which future development should take place.
The evidence for this comes from a number of sources:
After examining sites in a number of locations,BMW and Coca-Cola decided not
to establish new plants in Swindon;
Norwich Union withdrew from a scheme with the borough council to redevelop
the main shopping complex in Swindon, the Brunel Centre;
There have been cutbacks in spending at the economic development department
which has been largely responsible for promoting Swindon in recent years;
The council has decided to oppose the development of new greenfield sites.
on promoting growth.
Mr Tony Mayer, the leader of the Labour-controlled borough council, firmly
denies that the council wants to stop further development.
He says: 'Frankly, developers are taking far too naive a view of what we are
doing. BMW wanted to develop a 92-acre site at Lydiard Fields at the western
extremity of Swindon, just outside Thamesdown's local government area in the
neighbouring district of north Wiltshire.
'There was a lot of local opposition to the development because there is a
great deal of traffic around there, at Junction 16 of the M4 motorway. In
the end, the application went to appeal to the department of the environment
and permission was given.
'It was at the time of the collapse of eastern Europe and BMW decided it
would be better off in Munich. The site is being developed.
'As for Coca-Cola, they wanted to develop the so-called Triangle site next
to Honda. It was Thames Water which raised objections saying that there
would not be enough water in the area for what the company had in mind, in
terms of bottling or canning. It would have put pressure on the town's
resources.
'With Norwich Union we went through a long list of potential developers and
chose Norwich because of its good track record.
'We own the Brunel Centre. We accept that it needs refurbishing and
upgrading. We were and still are keen to redevelop it. But come the
recession, Norwich pulled out. It was we who were left in the lurch.'
Mr Mayer says that in none of these cases could the blame for projects
falling through be laid at the council's door. He insists that Thamesdown
remains keen to help development wherever it can.
The deputy leader of the council, Mr Jim D'Avila, cites the case of Honda
setting up on the old airfield on the east of the town at South Marston.
Honda bought the 360-acre site for Pounds 3m in the late 1980s. This was
less than a third of the going commercial rate at the time.
Had it not been so cheap Honda would probably have gone to either Wales or
the north of England. The reason it was so cheap was that the land did not
have planning permission.
Mr D'Avila says: 'Once we knew that Honda was seriously interested we moved
heaven and earth to get the planning permission. We knew that Honda would
generate lots of jobs.
'Rover might have disappeared without Honda and Rover is a major employer.'
Mr Mayer maintains it is just not true that the council has not made enough
provision for further development of the town.
He says: 'It is nonsense to suggest that we are anti-development. If you
take in the northern development area, the Tarmac development at Churchward
next to the station, the area left in the western expansion and the space on
at least seven business parks, there are hundreds of acres for development.
There is certainly enough space for at least the next 10 years. There is
also around 1m sq ft of office space available in the town centre itself.'
He continues: 'The developers are interested in greenfield sites because
they are cheaper and easier to develop. However, we must strike a balance.
There has been a major expansion here in the past 20 years, one of the
fastest anywhere in the country.
'Pressures do develop and we want to make sure that we not only preserve the
physical and social environment but also the economic environment. It was,
after all, the employers who were complaining to us about labour shortages.'
Explaining the cutbacks at the economic development department where the
head of social and economic development has been made redundant from his
Pounds 40,000 a year job along with others, Mr Mayer says:
'There has been a programme of redundancies and natural wastage but this
reflects the severe cutbacks which we, along with other local authorities,
have had to cope with in our spending. It does not mean we are less
committed to promote the town.'
Mr Mayer says that the council's revenue budget has been slashed from Pounds
25m last year to Pounds 23m this year and will be cut to Pounds 21m next
year. Economic promotion is one area where cuts have been made.'
He says: 'Times are very hard. We have Pounds 23m sitting in the bank from
the sale of council homes but we are not allowed to spend it. Our capital
budget has come down from Pounds 20m to Pounds 4m in the last two years.'
The crux of the matter is that a council which has for so long been
vigorously entrepreneurial and pro-active now finds stiff limits on its
spending abilities.
The caps imposed on its outlays by the central government are not the only
reason for its low-key promotion activities.
Mr David Griffin of J P Sturge, a main estate agent, says: 'It is important
to recognise that the council is no longer a major landowner. It is like an
old aristocratic landowner who has been forced to sell his estate but still
wants a say in how it is run.'
A council officer who does not want to be identified puts it differently:
'The council has had to undergo a cultural change now that it does not have
the funds or the land to be an instigator of change. It is still coming to
terms with this. Its changed role may have created the impression that it
wants to blow the whistle on further development. This is not true.'
Unfortunately it has been rather careless in the way it has presented its
case for consolidation.
The danger is that once the institutional money starts flowing again after
the recession ends, it will bypass Swindon and go to places such as Cardiff
which is heavily promotional, because Swindon is thought not to be
interested.

land available for future development
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE Thamesdown Borough Council claims there is enough land set aside to
ensure Swindon's continued growth for at least another 10 years.
Yet some estate agents and developers argue that there exists a pent-up
demand for new greenfield sites over and above the council's planning
allocations.
It is almost impossible to tell who is right because the recession has had a
becalming effect. There is little construction, few lettings and many of the
planned developments are on hold.
On paper, however, it looks as as if there are sufficient development
projects to continue the growth which has characterised Swindon for more
than 20 years.
Tarmac is involved in a big development in Churchward next to the station.
About 45 acres of this is a conservation area. It features 11 listed
buildings some of them reputed to have been built by Isambard Kingdom
Brunel.
On the remaining acres (the total development could be 137 acres), there are
plans for more than 1m square feet of business space (B1 light industrial,
B2 heavy industrial and B2 warehousing and distribution), some 160,000 sq ft
of retail and 100,000 sq ft of leisure.
To the north of Swindon, in the so-called Northern Development Area at
Haydon there are plans for a 10,000-unit housing project over a 1,500-acre
area. This would be combined with an 80-acre industrial site earmarked for a
campus of the Cranfield College of Technology.
Elsewhere, there are at least seven industrial estates which still have land
available. These include the Interface Business Park which covers nine acres
and the Lydiard Fields (92 acres with 50 acres available for industrial and
commercial space and in which Hilton Hotels is interested. There is also
space on the Delta Business Park, and on Burderop Wood, a 28-acre park.
In addition, there is at least 1m sq ft vacant in the town centre. Some of
this is hanging over from the last speculative spurt of building in the mid
1980s.
But Nationwide Building Society has exacerbated the situation by vacating
around 250,000 sq ft of office space in six blocks and moving its employees
to a new site outside the town.
There are also hundreds of acres available for housing development and if
the housing programme were to go ahead the population could swell by at
least 30,000 by the end of the century.
The Haydon programme is on hold at present because one of the developers
pulled out because of the recession. But it is likely the houses will be
built in a better economic climate. Estate agents say there might be enough
space available to meet expected demand, but the property may not be the
right kind.
Mr Mark Wightman, a partner in agents Dreweatt Neate, says: 'All the
inquiries we have been getting in this office have been for designer-built
and owned properties on new sites. There is very little interest in the
existing office stock in the new town.'
He adds: 'Much of the office space in the town centre was built in the 1960s
and 1970s. It has become outdated in terms of what companies want now. I
think even without the recession it will be difficult to move some of the
space on offer. It will take a long time.
'Much of the stock will have to be refurbished and in some cases it might be
a question of tearing them down and starting again. Swindon does have a
problem with the town centre. Apart from the office overhang, the shopping
centre, the Brunel, badly needs upgrading.'
Mr Wightman cites the 'Honda effect'. Honda is nearing completion of its 1m
sq ft car assembly plant, north-east of Swindon close to the A419. The
feeling is that once the plant is off and running it will draw dozens of
subsidiary companies.
They, Mr Wightman believes, will be looking for space on new sites close to
the Honda works. He says: 'The general feeling of the local business
community, backed by the Swindon Chamber of Comm-erce and Industry, is that
while acknowledging that there are sites to be developed within the existing
urban area, it is inevitable that further land will have to be released for
employment purposes to balance the housing approvals already granted.'
Mr David Griffin, a partner in J P Sturge another leading agent in Swindon,
argues along the same lines. He says: 'There is an overhang of second-rate
space. This space is failing to attract occupiers.
'But it is vital to distinguish between this and new space. Appearances to
the contrary, Swindon has not seen excess-ive speculative development of
office and industrial space seen elsewhere along the M4.
'We are only just beginning to see the Honda effect. Some 140 companies have
been designated as suppliers to Honda. Not all of them will be Swindon, of
course, but many will. I think it is important that more greenfield land be
released if Swindon is not to lose out to other locations in the 21st
Century.'
The official position of the Thamesdown Borough Council is that there is
plenty of land available for any expansion of business at least until the
end of the century. It is opposed to giving planning for any new greenfield
sites.
But, as Mr Jim D'Avila, the deputy leader of the council, says: 'We are not
against reviewing the situation, say in 1996, if circumstances change.'

SWINDON, as a centre for relocation, is like an old variety artist who has
continued pulling in the audiences in spite of the emergence of brasher new
attractions.
In the past 30 years, Swindon has been one of the most outstanding success
stories of all towns along the M4 corridor. Its population has grown from
around 70,000 in the 1950s to 178,000 today.
Although there is criticism by business that the Thamesdown local authority
has halted growth on greenfield sites, Mr Jim D'Avila, the deputy leader of
the council, has outlined development which will take Swindon well into the
next century.
Companies began moving to Swindon in the 1960s and continued to flock there
until the economy started to go into recession at the end of the 1980s, even
though other areas such as south Wales and the north-east were able to offer
grants and subsidies.
The Japanese car maker, Honda, chose Swindon in the late 1980s, and will
eventually employ 2,000 at its site at the old Vickers airfield on the
outskirts of town, even though it is unusual for a Japanese manufacturer of
this size to select the south of England. Japanese companies have tended to
go to Wales or Scotland and other old industrial areas, where the land is
cheaper and government grants have been available, or to new towns such as
Telford or Milton Keynes.
One obvious reason for Swindon's continuing success is its position on the
M4 close to Heathrow airport and London. The M5 and M25 are also close by
road, and London is only 55 minutes away by train.
But, it is also due to the foresight of local government leaders, who in the
1950s and 1960s bought up thousands of acres of land at agricultural prices.
Men such as the late Mr David Murray John, who today would be called the
chief executive of the borough council, was the town clerk for most of the
1960s and part of the 1970s.
Swindon was asked to take overspill population from London, after the Second
World War, and he realised that, with the population growing, the economy
would have to be diversified away from the dependence on its principal
employer - the railways.
Swindon Old Town and New Town were incorporated into the borough of Swindon
in 1900. The Old Town was a small market centre, on a hill catering for the
agricultural hinterland, while Swindon new town, at the bottom of the hill,
was the result of the growth in the middle of the 19th Century of the Great
Western Railway, which made the town its main engineering base and workshop.
Today, Swindon itself is part of the borough of Thamesdown. After the Second
World War, when the Great Western was nationalised with the other railway
companies to form British Railways, some 14,000 people were employed by the
railway - but by then the seeds of the subsequent decline in numbers, as
facilities were rationalised and maintenance simplified, had already been
sown.
Armed with the substantial land bank, the local council (which has been
Labour-controlled apart from a small spell in the 1970s) set about
attracting new employers.
The borough council could not give subsidies or sell land cheaply but its
ownership and planning powers meant it was well placed to play an enabling
role for private developers.
With the railways shedding jobs, skilled labour was available for incoming
companies. Agressive marketing by the council and a favourable location,
meant that companies flooded in.
By 1986/87, when the last British Rail engineering workshop (Brel) closed,
throwing some 2,000 on to the labour market, the population had grown to
168,000 from 70,000 in the 1950s. It is now 178,000, and, before recession
struck, Swindon claimed to be the fastest growing town in Britain.
A wide range of companies have been attracted: in financial services Allied
Dunbar and the Nationwide Building Society; in dist-ribution WH Smith,
Reader's Digest and Book Club Associates; in engineering, Honda and Rover;
in electronics National Semiconductors, Motorola, Intel, among others.
The boundaries of Swindon are not tightly drawn, so that although there is a
central business district in and around the new town and a central shopping
and leisure district, most of the 22 business parks are on the periphery.
The houses that have had to be built for the growing workforce are also
spread around the town.
Until recently, Swindon had not experienced the kind of congestion seen in
other fast-growing centres. By 1989, however, Swindon, too, was showing
signs of overheating, with unemployment down to 2.5 per cent.
Mr Tony Mayer, the leader of Swindon Borough Council, says: 'It was not just
a question of pressure on the environment, traffic congestion, parking
problems and the like. Economic pressures were also starting to occur.
Unem-ployment had fallen virtually to nothing and many com-panies were
finding it difficult to find the kind of workers they needed.'
The council decided it was time to consolidate. Specifically, it decided to
oppose the development of any new greenfield sites. This, in turn, led some
sectors of the business community to feel that the council had become
anti-development.
Mr Lorne Barling, the editor of Swindon Business News, says: 'The move to
oppose new greenfield sites, together with the decisions by a couple of big
companies like BMW and Coca-Cola not to come to Swindon, created the
feeling, rightly or wrongly, that council was no longer interested in
developing the town.'
Mr David Griffin, of estate agents J P Sturge which acts for some of the big
developers, says: 'I wouldn't quite say the council turned anti-development,
but running a town is like running a business. Unless you continue to
develop, then you go into decline. After the recession there will be a
demand for greenfield sites and if they are not here, the institutions and
owner-occupier businesses will look elsewhere.'
Suggestions that the council has turned against the bus-iness community are
vigorously denied by Mr D'Avila.
'Developers have misrepresented what we plan. We have given consents which
take us well into the next century. Our structure plan envisages 30,000 jobs
being created by the year 2001. The northern township devel-opment alone
will mean 10,000 houses and nearly 100 acres for industrial use.
'There is the Tarmac site by the railway which is 150 acres and plenty of
empty office space in the city centre. We are not putting the shutters up.
There is as much development in the pipeline now as there has ever been, but
our parks and leisure facilities are at capacity, and many companies were
complaining to us about labour shortages.
'We have to make sure there are enough homes for people who want to come
here, to ensure there are enough schools and to sort out the city centre,
both in terms of traffic, and refurbishing the shopping in the centre.
Around 80 per cent of the people we asked in a survey we undertook wanted us
to consolidate before we had further industrial devel-opment.'
The recession has taken the heat out of the debate for the moment, since
little housing development is taking place either in the northern
development at Hayden or on the Tarmac site although a lot of
infrastructural work has taken place. Once the economy improves, however,
the pressure will be on again for headlong growth.

FT  16 APR 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STRONG demand continued in the derivatives market, sending stock index
futures sharply forward and turnover in the traded options market higher,
writes Joel Kibazo.
Trading in the June contract on the FT-SE followed the recent pattern of low
demand at the open and June had retreated by 10 points to 2657 by 9.30am,
which proved to be the low of the day. A spate of large buying orders from
leading institutions reversed June's falls sending it forward as a squeeze
developed after dealers rushed to fill the orders. Independent traders
dominated dealing during the afternoon session though demand remained high.
June closed at 2684, 41 ahead on the previous session and around 25 points
above its estimated fair value premium to cash of about 22.
Turnover in traded options remained high at 41,545 matching Tuesday's total,
ahead of next week's expiry date.
The FT-SE option was again busy, trading 13,365 contracts, while the Euro
FT-SE recorded a day's turnover of 6,789 lots. Thames Water remained the
busiest stock option. It traded 2,545 lots. This was followed by Hanson in
which 2,511 lots were and then by Boots with 1,352 contracts.

FT  16 APR 92 / London Stock Exchange: Footsie edges towards all-time high
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UK equity market moved to within striking distance of its all-time high
after another heavy wave of domestic and overseas buying interest stimulated
by last week's Conservative victory in the general election.
Yesterday's 39.7 jump took the FT-SE 100 share index up to 2,640.2, only
some 40 points short of the all-time high of 2,679.6, reached on September
2, 1991. Over the past five trading sessions - or since polling day - the
Footsie has risen almost 250 points, or 10.32 per cent per cent.
There was further strong encouragement for the market, and more particularly
for City investment houses, in the high level of turnover on the stockmarket
since last Friday's election result. Yesterday turnover expanded to 829.3m
shares, the second highest this year. This compared favourably with
Tuesday's 601.8m shares and Monday's 629.3m but fell well short of last
Friday's 1.34bn.
The sharp upturn in the number of shares traded obviously brings with it a
similar increase in the value of customer business and broker commissions.
'If nothing else, the Conservative election win has saved hundreds of jobs
in the City,' said one broker.
London was up and running from the outset, with strong buying of the Footsie
future after hours on Tuesday leading the cash market higher. The future
remained at a big premium to the cash market all day, closing some 47 points
above the footsie and 25 points above fair value.
Some traders said the market had been taken by surprise by the weight of
money pouring into UK equities since the election. 'We expected a big jump
but nothing like this,' said one who added that marketmakers, having sold
out of what were generally small bull positions in equities, are now looking
at short positions in many areas.
The initial burst of strength in London was helped by the big gains on the
world's two most important stockmarkets, Wall Street and Tokyo. Wall Street,
which hit an all-time peak on Tuesday, was moving ahead strongly as London
closed, while Tokyo, bruised and battered in the past few weeks, staged a
good rally overnight.
Worries that the market may have run ahead of itself in the post-election
euphoria were not taken too seriously by senior dealers. 'We have not seen
any real selling into the market and fund managers are very frightened to be
out of equities.'
He said the market was well aware of the likelihood of a big rights issue
queue forming up, but mentioned the good performance of sterling and the
recent signs that the economy is moving out of recession, albeit very
slowly.
Midland Bank remained the focus of attention as Hoare Govett, the
stockbroker, made another unsuccessful attempt to place a block of 60m
shares in Midland for the Kuwait Investment Office. Composite insurers
surged higher although specialists cautioned that the sector, battered by a
series of insurance disasters including natural disasters and colossal
claims for mortgage indemnity, could well be first in the queue to raise
much needed funds.

FT  16 APR 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): CAC-40 nears 2,000 in active
trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BOURSES closed mostly firmer in the run-up to Easter, writes Our Markets
Staff.
PARIS approached 2,000 on the CAC-40 index in active trading, buoyed up Wall
Street's record close overnight. The index went as high as 1,995.39 before
closing up 18.38 at 1,990.69. Volume was heavy at FFr4bn, but Perrier and
Exor accounted for just over FFr1bn.
Positive 1991 results pushed up several stocks. The builder GTM-Entrepose
rose FFr22 to FFr402 after announcing a 50 per cent rise in net attributable
profit last year, while L'Oreal added FFr20 to FFr865 after its pleasing
1991 figures. Dealers said that the shares in the beauty products company
were starting to look expensive.
Euro Disney continued to fall, closing down FFr3.20 or 2.3 per cent at
FFr136.30 while Eurotunnel weakened for a second day in heavy trading on
fears that it might announce a rights issue when it publishes its results on
April 24. The stock went as low as FFr36 before closing down 55 centimes at
FFr37.40 with 2.9m shares traded, its lowest close this year.
FRANKFURT took comfort from some encouraging economic data. The DAX index
rose 10.96 to 1,743.49 while the FAZ index, calculated at midsession, gained
1.97 to 709.09. Turnover rose to DM5.6bn from DM4.4bn.
Before the market opened the Bundesbank reported an improvement in the
annual rate of inflation, down to 3.5 per cent from about 4 per cent.
Further positive news came later in the day with a return to surplus in
February of the west German trade balance, after a deficit the previous
month.
The market seems to have discounted the threat of a public sector pay
dispute, with analysts noting that the difference between the two sides is
small. However, Bonn has said that the increase sought by the unions could
cost DM15bn.
There was little corporate news to excite the market. Daimler and Siemens
continued to advance on positive reports earlier in the week. Daimler rose
DM6 to DM787.50, while Siemens advanced DM4.10 to DM688.30.
Car stocks were generally positive after Tuesday's news of an improvement in
first quarter sales. BMW was DM4 ahead at DM586.50 and Volkswagen up DM3.20
at DM373.90.
In the construction sector Hochtief advanced DM7 to DM1,317. Analysts have
put out some encouraging reports recently on the sector, with Kleinwort
Benson forecasting that output in east Germany could grow by 17 per cent in
1992, after 5 per cent in 1991. Holzmann gained DM9 to DM1,193.
MILAN closed slightly firmer in technical trading at the close of the April
trading account. Dealers said the session started 10 minutes late as traders
wanting to carry over their short positions into the new account had
difficulty in borrowing stock for end-account purposes. The Comit index rose
0.38 to 499.54 in turnover estimated at L100bn after L87.7bn.
The overhang of short positions in Sip prompted some traders to attempt a
'bear squeeze' by pushing up the share price. Sip ended L31.50 or 2.2 per
cent higher at L1,489.5.
Fiat gained L30 to L4,755 while Pirelli rose L44 or 3.6 per cent to L1,270
on London buying.
Cir, the holding company of Mr Carlo De Benedetti's group, fell L19 or 1.2
per cent to L1,526. The court verdict on Mr De Benedetti for his alleged
involvement in the fraudulent bankruptcy of Banco Ambrosiano in 1982 is
expected today.
ZURICH advanced strongly. The SMI index rose 20.3 or 1.10 per cent to
1,874.1, just off a 1992 intraday high of 1,874.3, lifted by today's expiry
of share options and futures.
Georg Fischer bearers advanced SFr45 to SFr1,010 following Tuesday's
announcement on strong earnings growth this year.
Roche certificates gained SFr30 to SFr3,180, and Ciba-Geigy registered
shares, added SFr60 to SFr3,520.
AMSTERDAM saw a good performance from publishers. The CBS Tendency index
closed up 0.9 at 126.4.
Wolters Kluwer, which held its annual meeting, added Fl 1.40 to Fl 74 and
Elsevier gained Fl 1.30 to Fl 116.80.
Elsewhere, DSM rose Fl 2.20 to Fl 110 on better-than-expected first quarter
earnings estimates.
STOCKHOLM was lifted by Wall Street and a decline in domestic interest
rates. The Affarsvarlden general index rose 10.2 to 984.3 as turnover rose
to SKr570m from SKr390m. The forestry sector index gained 2.2 per cent.
MADRID gained ground. The general index rose 2.83 to 252 in turnover
estimated at Pta12bn.
Telefonica put on Pta15 to Pta1,100 in spite of a breakdown in pension fund
negotiations with the unions.
OSLO jumped 1.9 per cent, helped by rises on foreign stock markets. The
all-share index rose 7.77 to 420.18 in turnover worth NKr180m.

FT  16 APR 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Tokyo gains on buying by
investment trusts
</HEADLINE>

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
INVESTORS were encouraged by Tuesday's advance on Wall Street, and share
prices extended gains, briefly rising above the 18,000 level, writes Emiko
Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei average rose 508.43 to 17,948.01. After opening at the day's low
of 17,492.47, the index gained on large-lot orders by leading Japanese
brokers. The index advanced to the day's high of 18,041.45, recovering the
18,000 mark for the first time in seven trading days.
Volume increased to 350m shares from 250m. Investment trusts and dealers
were main buyers, while pension funds also placed orders at lower levels.
Foreigners were seen buying in small lots.
Advances led declines by 956 to 100, with 71 issues remaining unchanged. The
Topix index of all first section shares moved up 33.19 to 1,321.99. In
London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 1.27 to 1075.22.
The overnight rise of the Nikkei futures in Chicago also prompted buying in
the futures market. Mr Nick Cant at Baring Securities said the rise, in
spite of the lack of fresh news, was encouraging. He added that domestic
institutions' purchases of high-technology stocks supported sentiment.
Large orders were placed in the electronics sector, where stocks rose on
active trading. Hitachi, the most active issue of the day, rose Y16 to Y831
and Sony added Y190 to Y4,300.
Machinery issues, potential beneficiaries of the government's promotion of
labour-saving measures, gained ground. Amada rose Y60 to Y1,1170 and Takuma
added Y31 to Y911.
Speculative favourites were sought by short-term players. Nippon Carbon
continued its rise, gaining Y60 to Y711, and Citizen Watch rose Y36 to Y869.
Bank shares were higher: Industrial Bank of Japan rose Y110 to Y1,820 and
Mitsubishi Bank advanced Y70 to Y1,820.
Aids-related issues fell on profit-taking, with Okamoto Industries down Y20
to Y1,160 and Mochida Pharmaceutical easing Y60 to Y2,990. Teac, an
electronics maker, which has been promoted by Japanese brokers recently on
the 'US recovery theme', lost Y10 to Y1,030.
Sega Enterprises, the video game maker, lost Y490 to Y8,350. The issue has
fallen 16 per cent over the past three days, on an alleged patent
infringement.
In Osaka, the OSE average surged 517.44 to 19,861.74 with 24.5m shares
traded. Foreigners and domestic institutions sought high-technology issues,
but pharmaceuticals were depressed on profit-taking. Nintendo rose Y120 to
Y9,620, while Ono Pharmaceutical lost Y80 to Y6,200.
Roundup
THE overnight gains on Wall Street and Tokyo lifted most of the markets in
the Pacific Rim.
HONG KONG advanced strongly following the announcement on Tuesday of HSBC's
merger terms with Midland Bank of the UK. The Hang Seng index was 102.58
stronger at 4,986.11 in turnover of HKDollars 2.37bn.
HSBC rose HKDollars 1 to HKDollars 40.25, while Hang Seng Bank gained
HKDollars 2.50 or 6.8 per cent to HKDollars 39.00. Property stocks were also
higher, as Cheung Kong rose 50 cents to HKDollars 20.90.
SINGAPORE remained dull. The Straits Times Industrial index gained 17 to
1,394.32 in volume of 31.7m.
Malayan Credit, which is facing a takeover by a local car distributor, lost
1 cent to SDollars 2.16.
SEOUL rose in the afternoon session on rumours that the Market Stabilisation
Fund could be extended. The composite index rose 2.55 to 578.11, having
earlier reached an intraday high of 584.74. Turnover was Won253.9bn after
Won252.8bn.
TAIWAN reversed early gains. The weighted index fell 22.32 to 4,439.66 in
turnover of TDollars 15bn from TDollars 17.5bn.
MANILA was stronger. The composite index rose 21.56 to 1,170.80 in turnover
of 135m pesos.
KUALA LUMPUR moved ahead in quiet trade. The composite index gained 3.68 to
568.19 in volume of 23.4m shares.
AUSTRALIA was boosted by a survey showing that consumer confidence was
improving. The All Ordinaries index closed up 15 at 1,580.6 in turnover of
ADollars 219.3m.
News Corp closed up 82 cents at ADollars 18.92 and BHP was 20 cents firmer
at ADollars 13.60.

FT  16 APR 92 / World Stock Markets: Shopping around in a global retailing
sector - Investors who are increasingly seeing signs of new life in
pan-European retailers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN THORNHILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INVESTING IN European retailing stocks has primarily been determined by
national considerations with investors backing companies in countries where
economic growth and consumer spending promise to be the most buoyant.
The German retail sector has been a prime example of the phenomenon as
investors bid up retail stocks to take advantage of the strong consumer
sales and growth opportunities created by unification.
The German stores sector was lifted to a rating of 30 times earnings in 1990
but has since slipped back to 17 times in 1992 as the Bundesbank applied a
squeeze on interest rates to get inflation back under control.
The retail component of stock markets in several other European countries
has also fallen back as consumer spending expectations for 1992 have
remained generally bleak. But there appears to be a growing belief that
consumer spending should pick up markedly in the second half of this year
and many retail stocks are twitching back to life.
However, as retailers slowly internationalise their businesses, such simple
national economic determinants are becoming increasingly obsolete. Many of
the bigger European retailers have invested heavily outside their domestic
markets, broadening their exposure to growth in other countries and
continents.
For example, many French food retailers have sought to escape the
constraints of their dire home market by investing abroad. Carrefour now
derives 40 per cent of profits from hypermarket operations in Spain,
Argentina, Brazil, the US and Taiwan, while Promodes made 45 per cent of its
profits in 1990 from stores in Italy, Portugal, Spain and the US.
A study by UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, the London-based stockbroker, found that 22
of the 37 big quoted continental European retailers had some foreign
earnings - almost 18 per cent of their profits outside their domestic
markets.
Although this international exposure is considerably less than in most other
industrial sectors, some individual retailers, such as Delhaize Le Lion of
Belgium, and Ahold of the Netherlands, now derive more than half their
income from their stores in the US.
At an international retailing conference held by Goldman Sachs at the start
of April, Mr Tom Smith, chief executive officer of the successful Food Lion
grocery chain, which is partly owned by Delhaize, outlined an ambitious
expansion strategy, promising to open 125 stores this year.
Food Lion's rapid expansion has largely been responsible for Delhaize's
profits growth, which has been constrained in Belgium by the mature
retailing market and restrictive planning laws.
Partly as a result of these developments, many investors, particularly the
American and Japanese fund managers, are already viewing retailing stocks on
a pan-European basis. And as the single market develops and national
economies converge, there will increasingly be a case for investing in
individual retailing stocks rather than national sectors.
UBS Phillips &amp; Drew believes that two groups of European retailing stocks
offer attractive prospects: German retailers, which will benefit from the
upsurge of consumer spending in the eastern Lander; and the geographically
diversified retailers, such as Carrefour, Promodes, Delhaize and Ahold,
which are well positioned to sustain good international profits growth in
spite of saturated home markets.

FT  16 APR 92 / Money Markets: Easter tactics begin
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
EASTER was on everyone's minds yesterday as the players began the
traditional strategic dealing before the four-day weekend.
The most distinctive feature was a lack of action in the money markets in
the early morning, despite a forecast Pounds 1.05bn shortage.
Some analysts suggested that the resounding silence could have been due to a
watch and wait syndrome. 'They all sat back and waited to see what everyone
else was going to do. Therefore nothing was offered,' said Mr Nick Parsons
of CIBC.
The two days before Easter are among the most important days of the money
market year. This is when discount houses and clearing banks begin to try to
manipulate the overnight rates ahead of the long weekend.
For example, yesterday players held back paper, Mr Parsons suggests, thus
forcing up overnight rates. Today they will have more to offer and be able
to eliminate the shortage early in the morning. This will bring overnight
rates tumbling at just the point when players are seeking to fund their
sterling books. Since today is the last trading day for four days, the books
derive cheaper rates for longer periods.
Events in the market would appear to have supported this view. The Bank of
England did not take up offers in the early round, if any were made, forcing
the overnight rate as high as 11 1/2 per cent at one stage. However, just
before lunch, the Bank eliminated the shortage in one fell swoop with a
chunky Pounds 664m repo due on May 6 at 10 7/16 per cent, and a Pounds 386m
band one bank bill purchase at 10 3/8 per cent. Overnight rates tumbled
immediately to 9 1/2 per cent.
Further out, money rates moved very little. The key three-month interbank
rate eased slightly from 10 1/2 - 3/8 per cent to 10 3/8 - 5/16 per cent.
One year money was steady at 10 1/4 - 1/8 per cent.
On the futures market, the June short sterling contract ended eight points
higher at 89.88, implying an interest rate of 10.12 per cent in the medium
term.
In Germany, call rates were a shade easier following the Bundesbank's DM300m
injection, edging back from 9.60/70 to 9.60/65. In the US, the Federal
Reserve added liquidity to the system as funds were trading at 4 1/8 per
cent. The presumed target is 3 3/4 per cent, while the average yesterday was
3.68 per cent.

FT  16 APR 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Pound buoyed by ERM talk
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STERLING held firm yesterday, buoyed by the raft of rumours over a weekend
move to the narrow 2.25 per cent band of the exchange rate mechanism, writes
Peggy Hollinger.
Speculation mounted in the early part of the day that the UK and Spain would
move jointly over the weekend to join the narrow band. However, traders
dismissed the actual possibility that UK or Spanish authorities were ready
to yield the flexibility of the wider band.
Yesterday's rumours were only the opening shots in what will be a weekly
occurrence, some suggested. The trend has been for realignments, new
parities and moves to narrower bands all to occur after trading hours on a
Friday. This would mean that every Friday until the currency is actually
moved into the new band, rumours would support sterling.
'This is the first and I don't believe it,' said Mr Nick Parsons of CIBC.
'You will not see sterling join the narrow band this side of midsummer's
day.'
The UK currency ended the day in London 50 points higher at DM2.9175. This
reflected both the strong underlying demand for sterling and the general
weakness of the D-Mark.
The peseta suffered from the narrow band rumours, as the interest rate
implications filtered through to the market. The Spanish currency weakened
from Pta 62.54 to Pta 62.79 per D-Mark. The Spanish authorities refused to
comment on the rumours.
The French franc took traders by surprise with a late rally leaving it at a
12 month high against the D-Mark. Most were hard-pressed to explain the
rise, suggesting that D-Mark weakness was again to blame. However, others
said the franc had gained some support from the promotion of former finance
minister Pierre Beregovoy to Prime Minister, and from France's record in
dealing with inflation.
The dollar had another frustrating day, with markets muted ahead of the
Easter holiday. US industrial production figures - which were virtually flat
 -had little effect.
The greater influence came from comments out of Tokyo that the US and Japan
were ready to protect the yen if need be.
Dr Gerard Lyons, of DKB International argues that the focus is likely to
switch to the yen in the next few weeks. Speculation over deals between
Washington and Tokyo at the G7 meeting later this month could fuel more
volatile movements in the Japanese currency.
The dollar ended the day in London a touch stronger against the yen from
Y132.75 to Y133.45.
The fact that traders were reluctant to be short of dollars ahead of the
long weekend helped the US currency ignore otherwise depressing factors.

FT  16 APR 92 / World Commodities Prices: Wool
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
There are no auctions during the Easter recess and overseas wool prices were
firm or slightly dearer before the holiday took effect. The tendency was not
pronounced enough to bring in any urgent buying, however, and dull and
featureless trading is considered probable for the rest of this month.
Beyond that there is cautious confidence in firm wool values, but it is
recognised that 4 million bales of Australian stockpile wool still overhang
the market and that buying by the former Soviet Union areas will not put
pressure on supplies. Wool production forecasts meanwhile indicate a
continuing decline.

FT  16 APR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Bolivia prepares mining
industry for reincarnation - A wave of foreign investor interest is raising
hopes for the sector's recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BARHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BOLIVIA, LEFT for dead by the world mining industry when the bottom fell out
of the tin market during the 1980s, may yet see the resurgence of its once
flourishing mining sector. Excited mining analysts and businessmen claim the
country is on the threshold of a boom the like of which it has not seen
since the days of the tin barons of the 19th century.
A timely combination of new pro-business legislation and important
discoveries have attracted a swarm of international mining groups. Mr Scotty
Bruce, a mining consultant in La Paz, says: 'Out of 37 companies that have
recently come to Bolivia to look around, 21 have registered (with the
government) and have begun exploring'. Most of the companies are searching
for gold, silver and zinc.
Mr Bruce expects mining investment to rise to Dollars 120m this year. That
may be small change in the international mining game, but it is three times
the 1991 level. He believes that Bolivia 'can double export sales in the
next five years, from Dollars 400m now'.
In fact, the mining boom has been in gestation for some time. Inti Raymi, a
US-owned mining company, was set up seven years ago to develop gold deposits
around the Andean town of Oruro. It invested Dollars 17m to create Bolivia's
first open pit mine, marking an important shift in mining technologies.
Until then, Bolivian mining was limited to working narrow, dangerous and
labour-intensive underground veins.
Inti Raymi now produces 50,000 troy ounces of gold and 350,000 ounces of
silver annually - all of which is exported. In 1991 it reported sales of
Dollars 18m and net profit of Dollars 2.7m.
It is expanding the mine at a cost of Dollars 160m, in one of the largest
private investment projects ever undertaken in Bolivia. Mr Alvaro Ugalde
Canedo, Inti Raymi's general manager, says the expansion is well ahead of
schedule and should raise gold output to 240,000 ounces a year in 1993. The
company is 85 per cent-owned by Texas-based Battle Mountain Gold Company and
financed 63 per cent of the project with multilateral loans and the rest
with equity capital.
In another major advance, after years of negotiation, Bolivia has allowed
Lithium Corporation of the US to work a vast salt lake close to Oruro. It
awarded Lithco a 40-year concession to produce potassium, strontium and
boron at Salar de Uyuni, originally designated a national mineral reserve
and off-limits to private foreign companies.
But it was last year's approval of new mining legislation and foreign
investment regulations that put Bolivia back on the world mining map.
Bolivia treats local and foreign capital equally and has established what is
said to be the most pro-business tax regime in South America. Congress also
eased a constitutional ban on mining by foreign-owned companies in border
regions.
One of Bolivia's most powerful attractions may be the fact that it has never
been thoroughly surveyed. Newly-arrived companies are particularly active in
the little-explored eastern lowlands. The discovery seven months ago of a
major copper deposit known as Don Mario confirmed earlier suspicions that
the east was rich in minerals.
That followed the discovery in 1989 of similar deposits in the region by
Comsur, a company part-owned by RTZ of Britain. Inconclusive studies in the
region by the British Geological Survey between 1976 and 1984 are now being
re-evaluated in the light of these discoveries. However, more work is needed
before the lowlands can be proclaimed a Bolivian El Dorado.
Not all the action is in the east. After nationalising most of the mining
industry in 1952, the government made no great effort to explore the Andean
region or modernise technology; and private companies are now looking
closely at the Andes. The western cordillera is particularly attractive
because it abuts Chile's exhaustively surveyed Andes. Veins known to
continue over the border into Bolivia may now be brought into operation.
Also, Comibol, the moribund state mining corporation, is seeking joint
venture partners to take over management of its virtually exhausted mines.
Several companies have signed contracts, among them Paranapanema of Brazil,
whose discovery of huge tin deposits in the Amazon helped to destroy
Bolivia's tin industry.
The government is privatising one of Comibol's few promising properties.
Comsur outbid competitors for the high grade silver and zinc Bolivar mine.
But negotiations to transfer control are bogged Comsur is owned by the
Sanchez de Lozada family, which also dominates the largest opposition party.
However, mining in Bolivia will always be an uphill struggle, despite its
promising geology, cheap labour and attractive investment environment.
Labour accounts for only about 10 per cent of a project's costs. But
equipment and chemicals have to be imported.
To be competitive, Bolivia must achieve economies of scale, use expensive
modern technologies and keep exploring to add reserves. That is not easy,
especially with low world prices. As a landlocked country with difficult
topography and a hopelessly inadequate transport infrastructure, shipping
minerals to port is a heavy additional cost.
And Bolivia is far from attaining political and economic stability. It
adopted rigidly orthodox economic policies in 1985 to cope with
hyperinflation of 24,000 per cent a year, but has never achieved high
growth. Discontent is growing and there is a risk of an anti-business,
anti-multinational backlash in next year's presidential election campaign.
Companies therefore seek correspondingly high rates of return. But the first
phase of Inti Raymi's Oruro mine provided a rate of return of only 17 per
cent, far short of an ideal rate of 25-30 per cent. The new phase, using
state of the art carbon in leach processes, should boost to only 22-24 per
cent.
Still, businessmen say, more in hope than with great conviction, that the
next government's hands will be tied by the country's critical financial
constraints. Said a Comsur executive: 'Bolivia has a very narrow path to
tread, determined by economic realities. There is not much room for
populism'.

FT  16 APR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Palm oil price downturn
forecast
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   KUALA LUMPUR
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MALAYSIAN PALM oil output is gradually rising after a seasonal downturn and
traders say this could reverse the strong price uptrend as stocks, now the
lowest in three years, are also likely to build up again, reports Reuter
from Kuala Lumpur.
'We expect the market to hit a downturn in the coming months,' said one
trader. 'Forward months are already trading at a discount and we expect
strong selling at above MDollars 900 (Pounds 200) a tonne.'
Palm oil prices eased in afternoon trade yesterday on news that Malaysia
end-March palm oil stocks were higher than expected. The Palm Oil
Registration and Licensing Authority put them at 483,744 tonnes, down 4.66
per cent from the end of February, but that was higher than an earlier trade
estimate of 450,000-460,000 tonnes.
'There was active producer selling following the PORLA news,' one broker
said. The July contract on the local palm oil futures was hovering at
MDollars 892 a tonne, down from a previous close of MDollars 901 a tonne.
Palm oil output in Malaysia, the world's biggest producer, rose to 441,390
tonnes in March from 382,860 tonnes in the previous month, the authority
said. Traders said output could rise to 560,000 tonnes by June.
Production is likely to peak in October or November before a seasonal
downtrend sets in again.
Analysts and traders said local palm oil reserves could also rise to 570,000
tonnes by June and 800,000 tonnes by September unless demand picked up
sharply. 'We see stocks going up steadily in May, June and July,' said a
trader with a European firm. 'Again, it depends on the export side, both by
Malaysia and Indonesia.'
Palm oil futures had surged to MDollars 944 a tonne on March 20, the highest
since May 1989, on supply tightness.
Traders said the July contract could find support at MDollars 880 a tonne.

FT  16 APR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Anglo American announces Pounds
280m gold mine project
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   JOHANNESBURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE SOUTH African gold mining industry yesterday received a welcome fillip
with the announcement that the Anglo American Corporation is to develop a
R1.7bn (Pounds 280m) mine near Orkney in the Western Transvaal.
The announcement comes against the background of an industry whose profit
margins have been slashed in recent years by the combination of continuing
double digit cost inflation and stagnant gold revenues in rand terms. In
addition the March quarterly results indicate that the closure of two mines
 -West Rand Consolidated and Loraine - is likely in the near future.
Mr Clem Sunter, chairman of Anglo's gold and uranium division captured the
mood when he commented: 'We would like to provide some good news. We hope
this will be the turning point in the South African economy'.
The new mine is not a stand-alone project, but an extension to the Vaal
Reefs mine. The development of the Moab lease area - south-east of the
existing south lease area - will become the No. 11 shaft at Vaal Reefs. A
new company, Eastvaal Gold Holdings, will be formed to develop the mine and
will ultimately be listed. Vaal Reefs, with a market capitalisation of about
R3.6bn, is South Africa's second richest mine.
It is the first new development of a listed gold mine by Anglo since it
opened Elandsrand in the mid-1970s. It has subsequently opened some very
large new shafts, such as Freddies No. 1 last year and the No. 10 shaft at
Vaal Reefs, but none have involved opening up new lease areas. The last new
gold mines to be opened in South Africa were Joel and Oryx, both of which
have had slightly chequered careers.
Gold production will begin in 1997 and at full production the mine should
produce about 13 tonnes of gold per annum, making it a medium-sized
operation by South African standards. Over the 25-year life-span of the
project available reserves from the Moab area will provide some 26m tonnes
of ore for milling at an estimated recovery grade of 11 grams a tonne.
Although this makes it a high grade mine, Mr Sunter describes it as a
'tricky deposit', with parts of the ore body highly faulted. It is also
extremely deep: a main shaft will descend to about 2.5 km (1.5 miles)
underground, while two sub-shafts will go to 3.7 km.
Mr Sunter said the new project had been approached with 'Japanese logic':
instead of working out the capital expenditure of the project and then
having the rate of return determined by the level of the gold price, the
company had started with the current gold price, established a desired rate
of return, and then worked out what capital expenditure could be afforded.
He said that mine management had come up with lot of creative effort, which
had allowed the original capital cost to nearly be halved.
Mr Sunter added: 'It is a decent project at the current gold price, and we
actually feel we're at the bottom of the market'. He is predicting that an
upturn in world economies will be accompanied by an increase in gold
jewellery offtake and hence a tightening in demand and a rise in price.

FT  16 APR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Supply fears buoy sugar prices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FEARS OF a tighter sugar supply/demand balance in 1992-93 are supporting the
world market, according to reports from two London trade houses.
Raw sugar prices have recently touched eight-month highs, nudging 10 cents a
lb in the New York market, on fears of tight nearby supplies following
damage to the South African crop because of drought.
The trade houses, ED &amp; F. Man and Czarnikow, both point out in reports
published today that in the short term the changing export potential in
several countries will keep the lid on prices. The increasing likelihood of
a 1m-tonne increase in Thailand's crop, compared with the previous season,
together with the availability of exportable surpluses from India and Cuba,
should 'keep significant advances at bay', Man's latest sugar report says.
Man believes that reports of a catastrophic Cuban crop this season at 5m to
5.5m tonnes are unsupported by the evidence and estimates that the crop will
come in at about 6.5m tonnes. It is forecasting a crop of more than 5m
tonnes in Thailand and 12.6m tonnes in India.
The overall balance for the 1991-92 season remains marginally in surplus,
Man says, but it suggests that the situation is likely to be even more
tightly balanced in 1992-93.
Czarnikow's sugar review points out that the extent of the South African
drought has raised questions about the timing and coverage of the El Nino
weather phenomenon.
'Already a major drought is developing in Thailand which, if relief does not
arrive this month, could have serious implications for the next crop,' the
Czarnikow review says. 'If this is part of a regional phenomenon there might
be problems later in the year with the monsoon in India and this will need
to be monitored carefully.'

THE DANISH pig meat industry is to invest ADollars 80m to set up an advanced
pig meat processing plant in Scone, New South Wales, Australia, it was
announced here yesterday. The plant will be set up in a joint venture
between the Danish interests and the Australian pig meat producers, Brown &amp;
Hatton.
The Danish partner is Danpork, a consortium of leading Danish pig meat
interests, including meat processors Tulip International and Steff Houlberg,
the ESS Food meat trading organisation and institutional investors.
The Scone plant will be able to process 300,000 pigs a year initially,
rising to 600,000 after eight years.
The pig meat will be sold both domestically and in Asian markets.
Denmark is the world's leading exporter of pig meat products both to
European markets and to Asian countries.
Danpork was set up in 1990 with a view to utilising Danish expertise and
equipment to establish pig production and meat processing plants abroad.
Other projects are under consideration in Hungary, Poland, Malaysia, Korea
and Singapore.

GERMAN, DUTCH and Danish fishermen have called a summit meeting next month
to discuss ways of coping with a glut of North Sea prawns piled up in cold
stores.
Good fishing and breeding conditions have led to the build-up of more than
2,500 tonnes of prawns in the three countries, according to Mr Hermann Kock,
president of the Schleswig-Holstein prawn fishers' association.
'Wholesalers are not prepared to take any more,' he said yesterday. Prices
have fallen to about DM2.40 (83p) a kilogram.
His members, who between them operate 120 vessels, have already stopped
fishing at weekends and are reducing their weekly catch by up to 50 tonnes.
They are also planning to make long-term cuts and to switch some of their
fishing effort to catching sole.
The size of their boats and the unpredictability of the North Sea weather
confines the fleet to shallow, inshore fisheries.
The crisis meeting will be held on May 8 on the Danish island of Romo.

May SILVER futures fell below critical support at Dollars 4 a troy ounce on
Comex in hectic afternoon trading yesterday, depressing the precious metals
complex across the board. 'No one wants to buy it,' said one floor analyst,
while another predicted Dollars 3.50 would be hit in the short term.
Perceptions of more than adequate supply and lessening demand weighed on
sentiment after early selling by two big funds in Chicago. GOLD, which eased
further on the London bullion market, was setting life-of-contract lows on
Comex, also in hectic trading. London dealers said the failure to break
above Dollars 340 a troy ounce had turned sentiment bearish. On the LME
COPPER prices bounced off lows, three-month metal regaining the Dollars
2,200 a tonne level. Sentiment was helped by news that Chile's El Teniente
mine is closing its sub-level six until 1993 because of rock falls, although
Codelco said overall mine production should not be affected. New York
arabica COFFEE futures were sharply down at midsession after a rise in
warehouse stocks. 'This market just has no conviction to the upside,' said
one analyst, predicting a fall below 64 cents for the May contract.

FT  16 APR 92 / International Capital Markets: Taiwan remains vigilant on
inflow of foreign funds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALEXANDER NICOLL, Asia Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TAIWAN has had to slow inflows of foreign investment funds but remains
committed to deregulating and internationalising its markets, Mr Samuel
Shieh, governor of the island's central bank, said yesterday.
Mr Shieh told an audience of London brokers and investing institutions he
had decided to limit the remittance of foreign currencies to buy Taiwanese
equities because of concern about upward pressure on the Taiwan dollar.
'It is our policy to allow the funds to come in, but we also have to observe
some kind of stability of the exchange rate,' he said.
'Our economy is very export-oriented.' Inflows of between Dollars 20m and
Dollars 50m distorted the exchange rate because the foreign exchange market
in Taipei was very thin, doing business of only Dollars 30m to Dollars 80m a
day, he said.
Restrictions have been modified since the central bank suspended approvals
in February. Mr Shieh said the present policy was for each investing
institution or broker to negotiate a timing schedule with the central bank
before approval could be given.
Foreign brokers say they are generally able to obtain approval for
remittances of Dollars 5m per week for each investment scheme.
One investor told Mr Shieh it was a matter of concern that 'we can only in
invest in Taiwan when it suits you'. Mr Andrew Tuckey, chairman of Baring
Brothers, asked what could be done to expand the size of the foreign
exchange market. He said further moves to open Taiwan's markets would be
beneficial.
Mr Shieh said Taiwan had gone some way towards opening a foreign exchange
market. However, the move was sensitive because of the risk of excessive
speculation. 'The goal (of internationalisation) is to your liking. But the
speed may not be to your liking.'
Taiwan was discussing aid to the former Soviet bloc with the European Bank
for Reconstruction and Development, Mr Shieh said. He was a guest of Mr
Jacques Attali, EBRD chairman, at its annual meeting in Budapest this week.

ONE OF Sweden's largest brokers plans to develop a market for zero coupon
bonds of sub-investment - or 'junk' - grade.
The bonds - known as 'Jobs' or Junk Obligations - could be used to convert
non-performing loans to the troubled real estate sector into more easily
tradeable forms of debt, according to Ohman, a family-owned Swedish
brokerage.
Nordbanken, one of the Swedish commercial banks controlled by the Swedish
state, said it was looking at the securities as one possible way of dealing
with the non-performing real estate loans in its portfolio.
The use of such bonds has been limited so far. Ohman is close to finalising
details for the conversion of non-performing loans to Allhus, a Swedish real
estate company which made losses on property investments in London, into
SKr300m of sub-investment grade zero-coupon bonds.
The bonds will replace non-performing bank loans. The banks have agreed in
principle and will own the bonds, although Ohman hopes to act as
market-maker and sell bonds to investors, including speculators gambling on
a recovery in the real estate market.

THE chronic weakness of the Japanese stock market is dragging down other
south-east Asian markets, hindering new equity offerings.
Japanese investors, who had proved a mainstay, are scarce. However, dealers
said US fund managers were showing increasing interest.
China Steel's Dollars 400m offering of global depositary receipts, the first
Taiwanese deal this year, could be rather large for the market to digest,
according to some traders. Goldman Sachs is preparing to launch the deal.
Offerings of around Dollars 100m each are scheduled for President
Enterprises via Credit Suisse First Boston, and for Asia Cement via Morgan
Stanley.
Meanwhile, Samsung Electronics, the first Korean issuer to tap the market
this year, has tested the water for a series of Korean issues in the next
few months. The reception of Samsung's Dollars 100m convertible bond
offering, launched on Tuesday, suggests terms for future issuers will also
have to be enhanced.
The deal was originally planned to total Dollars 150m, with a 3 1/2 per cent
coupon, a premium of 10 to 16 per cent, and a yield to put of  1/8 to  3/8
point above the five-year Treasury. After initial marketing, the size of the
issue was cut, the coupon was indicated at 3 1/2 -3 3/4 per cent, and the
premium at 7-10 per cent. The yield to put was increased to  1/2 - 3/4 point
above the five-year Treasury.
'Bonds are being sold, but it is not a hot deal,' said one banker associated
with the transaction. However, Merrill Lynch said the deal was
oversubscribed.
Korea opened its stock market to foreign investors this year. The
convertible bond market, which was dominated by equity investors, has
suffered as a result.

FT  16 APR 92 / International Bonds: Mortgage-backed deal revives investor
interest
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN unusual mortgage-backed offering, structured to assuage the credit
concerns which have dogged the sector, revived interest in the sterling
mortgage-backed market yesterday.
The Pounds 170m deal was backed by mortgages originated by Union de Credit
pour le Batiment (UCB), the UK mortgage arm of Companie Bancaire, the French
financial services group.
Dealers said it met strong demand, due to the shortage of paper in the
market and attractive pricing of both public tranches of the issue.
The deal is the first securitisation of UCB's mortgage book, which totals
Pounds 4bn, and is designed to allow the company to increase its business in
the UK mortgage market by freeing up capital. However, there is speculation
that other foreign mortgage lenders who want to pull out of the market are
also looking at securitisation.
The sterling mortgage-backed market has been hit by growing credit concerns,
due to the high default rate as the UK housing market continues to sink.
Credit concerns have been heightened by the difficulties faced by pool
insurance providers such as Sun Alliance and Eagle Star, since many deals
were structured so that their triple-A ratings were based on the credit
quality of the insurance.
The UCB deal, dubbed LEO 1, does not rely on pool insurance for its triple-A
credit rating, but on its subordinated structure. The deal was divided into
three tranches; the third tranche consists of Pounds 12m of subordinated
notes.
In the sterling bond market, Hammerson Property, the UK property group,
became the third borrower in a week to tap the long-dated sterling market.
Dealers said the market, with its small investor base of UK institutions,
mainly insurance companies, was becoming overloaded with paper. The
unsecured bonds were priced to yield 227 basis points above the comparable
gilt.

FT  16 APR 92 / International Company News: Sega's winning touch in video
games - A company which has ridden out the recession
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When other Japanese companies revised profit estimates downwards and
expressed deep fears about the onset of recession, Sega Enterprises, the
video game maker, also reviewed forecasts, and concluded that its
expectations for sales and profits had been unduly modest.
Having scored unexpected victories over Nintendo, the world's leading home
video game maker, in the US and EC markets during the Christmas toy rush,
Sega's only foes appeared to be the villains in its ever more elaborate
software scenarios.
But Sega this week lost a battle against an unscripted enemy, a US patent
infringement action, and the Dollars 33m awarded to two inventors has
prompted concern in the Japanese electronics industry about a spate of
potential litigation from US and European companies and inventors.
The Sega case follows a ruling against Minolta, the camera maker, which
agreed last month to pay Dollars 127.5m to Honey well, the US technology
company, after a court decided that it had infringed on patents for
autofocus technology. About 15 other camera makers and electronics
manufacturers face similar litigation from Honeywell.
Mr Hayao Nakayama, the Sega president, and the architect of the company's
rise to international prominence over the past three years, is clearly
agitated by the Californian court ruling. He is angry that 'amateurs' are
allowed to sit on US juries deciding on complex technical issues, in this
case, colour image-displaying technology used in video games.
'We have concerns about the jury's level of understanding. This is a rather
simple case and its clear that we should be okay. We had certainly taken
professional advice before the hearing, and our professionals told us that
we would win,' Mr Nakayama said.
Sega now faces a dilemma similar to that of Minolta over whether to risk the
company's US prestige in a potentially protracted and image-damaging court
case. Minolta quickly settled with Honeywell after deciding that the likely
returns of an appeal were outweighed by the possible negative publicity.
The result of the case is already weighing down on the game company's share
price. Tokyo stocks have risen by an average 0.5 per cent during this week's
volatile trading, but Sega's price has fallen by 16 per cent since the
verdict was handed down at the weekend.
Mr Nakayama said that there would be 'benefits in a compromise for our young
company', but he is confident that the case will be won. And he also shows
supreme confidence that the company will be able to cope financially, if the
appeal is unsuccessful: 'We have a lot of cash, and this would be a one-time
payment.'
That large pile of cash, about Y60bn (Dollars 452m), has accumulated as the
company's sales have quadrupled over the past three years.
Sega is forecasting sales of Y210bn in the year to end-March, up from
Y106.6bn in the previous 11-month period, while pre-tax profit is expected
to double to Y32bn.
There are concerns that Japanese banks, burdened by bad debts and injured by
the stock market collapse, will be unable to meet their corporate customers'
needs for new lending. But Mr Nakayama said that Sega has no need for bank
finance, and apart from a Y20bn convertible bond issue last June, is able to
tap its cash flow.
The company, dominant in amusement arcade games within Japan, is expecting
to sell about 12m home game systems this year, up from 7.5m systems last
year, and reckons that it will share the world market 50-50 with the
hitherto all-conquering Nintendo.
While the company has successfully ridden out the recession in Europe and
the US, the downturn in the domestic economy has begun to influence consumer
spending. Tokyo department store sales for March fell by 7.8 per cent on a
year earlier, the largest real fall since 1965.
'In Europe, if you have a good product, then people are still prepared to
buy it, in spite of recession. In Japan, the psychology has changed. Until
recently, people bought whatever they wanted. Now it doesn't matter what
sort of product you launch, it's very difficult to attract them,' Mr
Nakayama said.
Another reason for Sega's slower penetration of the Japanese home video
market is that its game concepts have more appeal to foreigners than
Japanese, a difference that Mr Nakayam presumes is cultural. Europeans and
Americans, he says, like quick-hit, immediate gratification 'action games',
whereas Japanese tend to be fond of 'role-playing' games.
'These games require more thought, more attention to detail. Japanese like
to build little things. Some game maniacs in the US like the role playing
type, but it's the common thing in Japan,' he said.
There is likely to be more video competition in coming months, as Sega's
success has prompted the larger Japanese electronics groups, including NEC
and Sony, to expand their presence in the market. And Nintendo is upgrading
equipment and cutting prices in an attempt to take back the market share
lost over the past year.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR DAVID HUANG, chairman of Taiwan Aerospace, a consortium of the Taiwan
government and local companies, has resigned.
The move provides further evidence that the government is distancing itself
from the consortium's proposed Dollars 2bn deal with McDonnell Douglas, the
aircraft manufacturer, to buy up to 40 per cent of the US group's commercial
aircraft operations, and manufacture parts in Taiwan.
Mr Huang quit ahead of a meeting on April 22, when executives of Taiwan
Aerospace and Mr Vincent Siew, Economics Minister, are to decide to what
extent to go ahead with the deal.
Although state-owned companies hold 29 per cent of Taiwan Aerospace, the
government recently denied direct sponsorship of the proposed deal, in
response to criticism that financial problems make McDonnell Douglas a bad
choice for such a venture.
Analysts say that Mr Huang's resignation shows a cooling in the government's
approach to the deal, and indicates that Taiwan Aerospace might take as
little as a 25 per cent stake in McDonnell Douglas.

FT  16 APR 92 / International Company News: Gold mines face closure threat
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GENGOLD and Anglovaal managed to lift available profit from their gold
operations during the March quarter, but both are faced with the prospect of
soon having to close a mine.
In Gengold's case, West Rand Cons seems unlikely to last beyond the next
quarter, while Anglovaal's Loraine is also teetering on the brink.
Mr Jim Cockburn, Gengold consulting engineer, said bluntly: 'We've got a
disaster at WRC. Unless there's a substantial increase in the gold price
we're not going to be able to carry on.' The mine made a R2.6m loss during
the quarter. It lacks the ore reserves, and flexibility of grade, to turn
this position around, at the current gold price.
Anglovaal management said that they had been unable to secure 'adequate
forward prices beyond July 1992', a condition of Loraine staying open.
After-tax profit in the Anglovaal group was 2 per cent up at R42.3m (Dollars
14.7m) for the quarter, with R34.7m of this coming from Hartebeestfontein
whose performance was unchanged from the previous quarter.
Gengold lifted available profit after tax and capital expenditure by 45.6
per cent to R32.6m, compared to the December quarter.
Total gold production dropped by 0.4 per cent to 18,037kg. Working costs
were well held, rising by 0.2 per cent to R27,626 per kg, while the average
gold price received was 0.1 per cent lower at R32,534 per kg.
Mr Gary Maude, managing director of Gengold, said the two highlights of the
quarter were the return to profitability of Winkelhaak - which made an
available profit of R0.6m compared to a R10.1m loss in the previous quarter
 -and the ongoing increase in production at Unisel which had a difficult
1991. Bracken, Buffelsfontein, Grootvlei and Leslie all had improved
quarters.

FT  16 APR 92 / International Company News: Sappi in acquisition
negotiations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SAPPI, South Africa's largest pulp and paper group, looks set to expand
further abroad following an announcement that it is involved in negotiations
concerning a possible acquisition.
Sappi Europe, the group's European arm, was established in July 1990 after
the acquisition of five fine paper mills in the UK. In the 1991 annual
report Mr Eugene von As, now executive chairman, commented that 'much work
remains to be done on developing our European marketing, sales and
distribution network'. Any deal is likely to be in pursuit of these aims.
Last month Mondi, Sappi's main competitor, also took a further step into
Europe with the announcement that a consortium of Anglo American group
companies, including Mondi, was paying R550m (Dollars 191m) to acquire a 44
per cent stake in Frantschach, the Austrian pulp and paper producer.
Sappi also released its results yesterday for the 12 months to the end of
February. A recovery in the second half restricted the drop in net earnings
to a 17 per cent decline, to R313m. Net income had been 39 per cent down at
the halfway stage as Sappi faced depressed markets both at home and abroad.
Turnover rose by 6.5 per cent to R2.8bn, while operating income declined 17
per cent to R400.3m. Earnings per share were down 24.1 per cent to 402 cents
on account of enlarged share capital following a rights issue. The overall
dividend was unchanged at 200 cents per share.
Mr von As said the highlights of the year were the acquisition of Lotzaba
forests from Rand Mines and the R1bn rights issue. The former was an
important addition to the group's forest and mining timber business, while
the latter had helped lower group debt, and hence interest payments.

CANADIAN PACIFIC Forest Products reported a loss of CDollars 71.1m

shipments, poor prices for all products except timber and higher interest
costs.
A year earlier, the pulp and paper arm of Canadian Pacific incurred a loss
of CDollars 50.1m, or CDollars 1.14 a share. Sales in the quarter were
CDollars 430m against CDollars 488m.
Lower operating costs and a lower Canadian dollar continued to help, and
proceeds of a CDollars 218m equity issue had been used to reduce debt.
Pulp prices are firming and timber is up 25 per cent in the US since January
1. However, newsprint prices, remain depressed, while paperboard and
packaging and white papers are improving.

HONEYWELL, the US controls group, reported a sharp rise in first-quarter
income, lifted by a payment of Dollars 127.5m from Minolta, the Japanese
camera manufacturer, to settle a patent infringement dispute.
Net income for the quarter rose to Dollars 116.8m, or Dollars 1.67 per
share, from Dollars 71.8m, or Dollars 1.01, in the same period last year.
Worldwide sales revenues rose to Dollars 1.48bn from Dollars 1.47bn. 'In the
first quarter, we produced solid earnings in the midst of a languid
economy,' said Mr James J. Renier, chairman and chief executive officer.
The gain from the Minolta settlement was Dollars 108.3m after deducting
expenses associated with the legal dispute.
Honeywell took a Dollars 32.1m pre-tax charge for costs associated with
'productivity improvement programmes and the anticipated disposition of
certain non-strategic product lines'.
The company said this would include a unspecified number of job cuts.
'On a comparable basis, Honeywell earned Dollars 1.02 per share in the first
quarter of 1992, which is consistent with our expectations,' Mr Renier said.

FIRST Interstate Bancorp, one of the largest banks on the west coast of the
US, said it had talked recently to Kohlberg Kravis Roberts (KKR), the
leveraged buy-out specialists, about the possibility of discussions about
co-operative transactions.
Such transactions might involve First Interstate in acquiring thrifts or
banking operations in its existing geographic territory, the statement said,
and could lead to KKR making an additional investment in First Interstate's
shares or other securities.
The west coast bank stressed no deal was on the table. However, KKR holds a
9.69 per cent stake in First Interstate and the 'talks about talks' caused
the New York-based firm, best known for its Dollars 25bn bid for RJR
Nabisco, to make a new filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
KKR said that if talks started it might be unable to avail itself of the
'solely for the purpose of investment' exception to the anti-trust filing
requirements. The firm added that it did not intend taking its voting stake
in First Interstate beyond 10 per cent.
The Los Angeles-based bank tumbled into the red last year, hit by the
deterioration in the Californian economy and property market.
The bank's statement comes only days after it was disclosed that Aetna, the
large US insurer, has been talking to KKR about a possible buy-out of its
reinsurance subsidiary, American Re.
This underlined KKR's interest in the financial services sector, where - in
conjunction with Fleet/Nordstar - it recently acquired the failed Bank of
New England.

UNION Carbide, the US chemicals group, plans to sell its controlling stake
in the Indian subsidiary involved in the 1984 Bhopal poison gas disaster,
AP-DJ reports.
Part of the proceeds of the sale will go toward a previous pledge of Dollars
17m to fund a new hospital in Bhopal for victims of the disaster.
The company said Union Carbide India, the nation's largest maker of dry cell
batteries, was its last battery business. At the time of the Bhopal gas
leak, it also produced chemicals for agricultural pesticides. One of those
chemicals, methyl isocyanate, leaked from the plant, killing more than 3,000
people and seriously injuring 20,000.
Mr Robert Kennedy, chairman, said the company would seek 'a company or party
that's in a better position than we to provide the battery business with new
technologies and additional jobs.'
Union Carbide said it was seeking permission from Indian regulators to sell
its 50.9 per cent stake, or nearly 16.6m shares, at a price to be
determined. It said a quarter of the Indian company's shares were publicly
traded in Calcutta.
In 1989 the company settled all civil claims in connection with Bhopal for
Dollars 470m. Earlier this year, India set up five courts to process claims
by the victims of the disaster.
Union Carbide sold its Ever Ready/Energizer battery business in the US to
Ralston-Purina in 1986.

revalues

   HONG KONG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
IN THE wake of the disclosure of Hongkong and Shanghai Bank's true financial
position, after Tuesday's bid for Midland Bank, the colony's banking sector
was yesterday substantially revalued.
The finance sub-index of the Heng Seng index climbed 3.5 per cent, supported
by substantial gains from HSBC Holdings and its listed subsidiary Hang Seng
Bank, both of which started the trend toward full disclosure of their
financial position on Tuesday.
The overall market index rose 55.22 points, or 1.22 per cent, in the initial
five minutes of trading yesterday. The index ended the day 102.58 points, or
2.1 per cent, higher at 4,986.11, supported by a strong rise in Tokyo share
prices as well as the banks' rerating.
The remaining listed Hong Kong banks are all expected to announce inner
reserves in the short term, to avoid what would effectively be a false
market in their shares. Of these, only Bank of East Asia and Wing Lung are
expected to have reserves of any significance.
A spokesman for Bank of East Asia, Hong Kong's third largest banking group,
said: 'At the moment our board is not considering any plan to proceed with
disclosure of its inner reserves.' But the bank has in the past indicated it
would be unlikely to buck any trend on disclosure set by its competitors.
Inner reserves were introduced to enable the colony's banks to smooth out
earnings during times of trouble, in recognition of the important role banks
play in ensuring public confidence in the financial sector.
Hong Kong is prone to runs on banks for far less significant reasons than
the announcement of losses.
However, the international trend towards greater disclosure, combined with
the one-off positive effect of announcing higher earnings figures, seems
likely to win the day over a general tendency towards corporate secrecy in
Hong Kong.
'I think the smaller banks will follow suit soon. But I think the
declaration of inner reserves marks the high point for the banking sector,'
said Mr Ruary Neill, managing director of Schroder Securities (Hong Kong).
Hongkong Bank defied some pundits who had forecast a sharp fall in its share
price by closing up Dollars HK1 at HKDollars 40.25.
The bank's true profit in 1991 was HKDollars 8.46bn compared with the
reported profit of HKDollars 5.66bn after it had transferred an unspecified
amount to inner reserves.
That amount was HKDollars 2.8bn (USDollars 362m).
Hang Seng Bank on Tuesday said its results for 1991 were 60 per cent higher
than the profit figures disclosed in February, as a result of a HKDollars
1.7bn transfer to inner reserves.
Its shares rose HKDollars 2.50 to HKDollars 39, as investors reacted to the
higher-than-known figures.
Hong Kong's banks have had a remarkable 12 months, buoyed by their widest
mortgage lending margins since early 1985, enabling the banks to transfer
significant amounts to inner reserves while still disclosing substantial
earnings growth.
Analysts believe lending margins will widen further but there is no
indication of a contraction in the short term.

SOFT drink sales outside the US continued to fuel earnings growth at
Coca-Cola, the leading US carbonated beverage company that yesterday
reported a 19.4 per cent rise in its first-quarter net profit, to Dollars
383.1m.
The earnings improvement - slower than the 21.8 per cent increase achieved
during the last quarter of 1991 - translates into earnings per share of 58
cents, against 48 cents in the first quarter of 1991.
Revenues for the first quarter grew by 11.7 per cent, to Dollars 2.77bn,
while operating profits were 17.3 per cent higher at Dollars 579.4m.
Coca-Cola's slowest growth region in terms of unit case sales is in the US,
where such sales were only 2 per cent ahead in the first quarter of 1992. By
contrast, international unit case sales to retail customers improved by 7
per cent.
Sales in the European Community rose 6 per cent, including a 12 per cent
gain in France, 10 per cent in the Benelux region and 5 per cent in Germany.
Unit sales growth in the UK were sluggish at less than 3 per cent.
In the Far East, sales were 5 per cent higher, with a 12 per cent rise in
Japan, the largest market in the Pacific region.
Mr Robert Goizueta, chairman of Coca-Cola, said the strong volume and profit
performance in the first quarter 'bodes well for the rest of 1992'.
Wall Street appeared to agree with Mr Goizueta's prognosis and marked
Coca-Cola's share price Dollars  3/4 higher yesterday, to Dollars 82 3/4.

<TEXT>
WALL STREET securities house Bear Stearns yesterday reported record
third-quarter profits of Dollars 91.3m, a near 60 per cent increase on
earnings from the same quarter a year ago.
The company also announced a quarterly cash dividend of 15 cents a share on
outstanding common stock.
The strong third quarter took earnings for the first nine months of Bear
Stearns' fiscal year to Dollars 215.8m, which means profits are already
running 50 per cent ahead of the Dollars 143m earned in the entire fiscal
year 1990-1991.
The factors behind the company's record quarter were the same as those that
have powered Wall Street earnings since the middle of last year: strong
demand for bond and equity underwriting services, high levels of individual
investor activity in the US stock market, and favourable trading conditions
across all financial markets in the wake of declining domestic interest
rates.
Bear Stearns' total revenues for the quarter were Dollars 531.3m, up 47 per
cent from a year ago. A breakdown of the figures shows that revenues from
principal trading rose 77 per cent to Dollars 310.8m, from investment
banking they rose almost 50 per cent to Dollars 69.7m, while revenues from
commission fees climbed to 7 cent to Dollars 104.6m.
Total expenses in the quarter jumped sharply to Dollars 372.3m, but the bulk
of the rise was accounted for by higher employee compensation and benefits,
which are linked to profits and performance.

MERCK, one of the biggest US pharmaceutical companies, yesterday unveiled an
18 per cent increase in first-quarter earnings on sales which rose 9 per
cent.
Net income in the three months to March 31 was Dollars 568.7m or Dollars
1.47 a share, up from Dollars 483.5m or Dollars 1.25 in the first quarter of
1991. The results do not reflect Merck's three-for-one stock split which
will take effect on May 6.
Sales in the quarter were Dollars 2.22bn, against Dollars 2.05bn a year ago.
Foreign exchange translations cut sales by one percentage point. Mr Roy
Vagelos, chairman and chief executive, said sales growth was led by newer
products.
Although profits were in line with expectations, the 9 per cent growth in
sales was slower than expected and Wall Street marked Merck's shares Dollars
2 1/2 lower to Dollars 152 3/4 in morning trading.

AMERICAN Telephone and Telegraph (AT&amp;T), the biggest US long-distance
telephone carrier, yesterday reported a 17 per cent rise in its
first-quarter net profits to Dollars 883m or 67 cents a share, from Dollars
758m or 59 cents a year earlier.
Revenues were Dollars 15.38bn, compared with Dollars 15.27bn in the 1991
first quarter. All the figures include NCR, the large US computer
manufacturer AT&amp;T acquired last September.
AT&amp;T's sales of products and systems dipped 6 per cent to Dollars 3.45bn,
after falling 7 per cent to Dollars 4.4bn in the fourth quarter, although
sales of microelectronics components, consumer products, wireless and cable
systems and undersea cable rose in the quarter.
Revenues from computer products and systems sales tumbled 16 per cent in the
quarter. NCR, as a separate division, had operating income of Dollars 46m on
revenues of Dollars 1.54bn. Its results include extraordinary charges from
the company's merger with Teradata.
The recession in Europe and lower sales to some US telephone companies were
blamed for a 7 per cent decline in revenues from telecommunications network
products and systems business, which fell to Dollars 1.68bn.
Long distance calling volume rose 8 per cent in the quarter, while revenues
from financial services jumped 32 per cent, reflecting growth from AT&amp;T's
Universal Card.
On Wall Street, shares in AT&amp;T rose Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 42 7/8 at
midday.
Shares in Sprint climbed Dollars 1 7/8 to Dollars 23 1/4 after the third
biggest US long-distance carrier turned in first-quarter earnings of Dollars
136m or 62 cents a share, against Dollars 84m or 38 cents in the same period
of 1991.
Stripping out the impact of accounting changes, net income was Dollars 100m
in the latest quarter, while earnings per share rose 18.4 per cent to 45
cents.
Operating income from Sprint's long-distance operations rose to Dollars 67m
on revenues of Dollars 1.36bn, compared with income of Dollars 52m on
revenues of Dollars 1.34bn a year earlier. Local operations had a record
first quarter, with operating income of Dollars 178m on revenues of Dollars
714m, against Dollars 167m on revenues of Dollars 688m a year ago.

AMR, the parent company of American Airlines, yesterday met its forecast of
a small profit in the first quarter of 1992, turning in a surplus of Dollars
20m after tax.
American is one of the three largest US carriers, and only last week led an
important revamp of domestic air fare pricing.
This was matched by many competitors but it was then undercut by Trans World
Airlines and, to a lesser extent, USAir.
The modest first-quarter profit compares with the large Dollars 195m loss
American made during the first quarter of 1991, when the Gulf war-related
slump in traffic decimated the industry's profitability.
Mr Bob Crandall, AMR's forthright chairman, said that, although pleased to
be in profit, he still viewed the results as 'less than satisfactory'.
He said he hoped the new pricing structure - which centres on four basic
types of fares, all lower than previously offered in these classes, but
discards the numerous discount products - would produce 'the kind of
financial performance we seek'.
According to Mr Crandall, bookings with the airline have risen by 46 per
cent since the new pricing plan was announced.
Industry observers, however, have wondered how long American's simplified
system will 'stick'.
In the first quarter, American's revenues reached Dollars 3.51bn, compared
with the depressed Dollars 2.77bn a year earlier.
Fuel costs were 13.7 per cent lower, at Dollars 411m, and total operating
expenses rose 11.9 per cent to Dollars 3.37bn.
Revenue yield per passenger mile was up by 4.3 per cent to 13.98 cents,
while the load factor increased by 1.8 percentage points to 58.3 per cent.
American is also in talks with Canadian Airlines, over the acquisition of a
minority stake in the carrier.
Canadian told an airline industry conference in Toronto the two sides have
agreed in principle on the size and terms of the investment, and that a
services and marketing agreement could be finalised within weeks.
Mr Kevin Jenkins, president of Canadian, reportedly said he was
'comfortable' with suggestions that AMR will acquire 25 per cent of Canadian
for about CDollars 200m (USDollars 181.8m). Government agreements would then
be required.

<TEXT>
UPJOHN, the Michigan-based pharmaceuticals company, yesterday posted
first-quarter earnings growth of only 8 per cent in an industry where
leaders regularly turn in earnings growth of around 20 per cent.
Upjohn's slower growth reflects a 39 per cent drop in sales of the company's
controversial Halcion sleeping pill.
Before concerns about the drug's side-effects emerged, Halcion was the most
popular sleeping pill in the world and Upjohn's second-biggest product,
bringing in about 8 per cent of the company's sales and making an even
stronger contribution to earnings.
For the first three months of 1992, Upjohn had net income of Dollars 143.7m
or 80 cents a share, against Dollars 133.3m or 73 cents a year earlier.
Sales rose 9 per cent to Dollars 871.9m from Dollars 799.4m.
During the latest quarter, pre-tax earnings advanced 4 per cent to Dollars
189m, while operating income was 3 per cent higher at Dollars 186m.
Shares in the company rose Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 37 yesterday morning.

FT  16 APR 92 / International Company News: Apple suit dismissed in surprise
ruling
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SAN FRANCISCO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
APPLE Computer has suffered a stunning defeat in its landmark copyright
infringement suit against competitors Microsoft and Hewlett-Packard with the
dismissal of most of Apple's claims by a San Francisco court.
Apple filed suit against Microsoft and Hewlett-Packard in 1988 charging that
Microsoft's Windows program and Hewlett-Packard's NewWave program infringed
upon the copyrighted computer screen displays of Apple's popular Macintosh
personal computer.
In rulings issued late on Tuesday that surprised all parties, a San
Francisco judge granted virtually all of Microsoft and Hewlett-Packard's
arguments that elements of the computer displays, such as movable symbols or
'icons' and overlapping windows, are not protected by copyright, either
because they do not represent 'unique expressions' or because they were
covered by a 1985 licensing agreement between Apple and Microsoft.
The suit had cast a cloud over the runaway success of Microsoft's Windows,
which provides ease-of-use features similar to the Apple Macintosh for
IBM-compatible personal computers.
Microsoft has sold over 10m copies of Windows 3.0, a version of the program
launched in June 1990.
Apple had been expected to seek damages of Dollars 5.5bn according to
Microsoft, which recently disclosed the estimate of damages prepared for
Apple by an independent expert.
Microsoft's stock price surged on news of the rulings, rising to Dollars 129
in midday trading yesterday from a Tuesday close of Dollars 117.
Hewlett-Packard was up Dollars 1 3/4 at Dollars 81 5/8 , while Apple gained
Dollars  3/4 to trade at Dollars 59 1/2 .
Although some issues in the case have yet to be resolved, the rulings have
'substantially narrowed the areas of dispute' Mr Edward Stead, Apple's
general counsel, acknowledged.
Microsoft and HP officials hailed the rulings as a victory. 'Apple's case
has been eviscerated,' said Mr John Stark, an attorney representing
Hewlett-Packard. 'If it wasn't a complete victory, it was certainly at least
a 95 per cent of the way,' said Mr David McDonald, a lawyer for Microsoft.
What remain are 'miniscule' issues such as the appearance of a 'trash can'
image that symbolises the process of discarding unwanted data, said Mr
Stark. 'It now appears unlikely that the case will go before a jury,' he
added. 'The case is over in terms of liability.'
Apple is still analysing the rulings said Mr Stead. He indicated, however,
he may ask Judge Walker to reconsider his rulings.
If that fails, Apple will continue to pursue the remaining elements of the
case while considering an appeal.
However, Apple's chances of prevailing appear to have been significantly
diminished. Lawyers on both sides said the judge appeared to have been
strongly influenced by a recent appeals court ruling in a separate software
copyright case that rejected the 'overall appearance' approach.
In an appeal, Apple would have to persuade the same appeals court to reverse
its opinion.

ASEA Brown Boveri (ABB), the Swiss-Swedish engineering group, has acquired a
51 per cent stake in Elta, the Polish power transmission company, for
Dollars 10.4m.
Elta, one of the first companies in Poland's power generation sector to be
privatised, manufactures transformers, static converters and electrical
equipment for trains.
ABB signalled its interest in Elta about two years ago. The Swiss-Swedish
group has steadily built up its presence in the Polish market. It has two
joint ventures - ABB-Dolmel, in the power generator business, and
ABB-Zamech, which makes turbines. ABB's other operations in Poland produce
signal equipment, desulphurisation equipment and telecommunications parts.
ABB said it would take responsibility for the management of the Elta, which
would be consolidated in the ABB group. It plans to modernise the existing
production of transformers.

<TEXT>
AIR France, the French state-owned airline which recently concluded a
partnership deal with Sabena of Belgium, cut its loss in 1991 to FFr685m
(Dollars 122.3m), compared with a deficit of FFr717m in the previous 12
months.
The French airline, together with its international competitors, was badly
affected by the impact of the Gulf War on air travel during the first half
of last year when it posted a net loss of FFr1.16bn. However, it mustered a
recovery in the second half and managed to break even at an operational
level. For the year as a whole, operating profits stood at FFr213m, against
an operating loss of FFr1.14bn in the previous year.
Air France, which owns Air Inter, the domestic French airline and UTA cargo
service as well as its eponymous international airline, reduced operating
costs by 1.1 per cent during the year through its ongoing cost-cutting
programme.
The group experienced an overall increase in turnover of 1.4 per cent to
FFr57.6bn during 1991.
This was due to a modest rise in prices, which countered the effect of a
real decline in traffic in both the passenger and cargo sectors.
Air France had to swallow an increase in financing costs during the year,
mainly because of the impact of the 37 new aircraft of which it took
delivery in 1991.
It was also hit by provisions of FFr700m to finance its restructuring in
1992 and 1993. This will include shedding staff and internal reorganisation.
The contribution from exceptional gains fell from FFr1.93bn in 1990 to
FFr1.58bn in 1991, in spite of the proceeds of the sale of its Paris
headquarters at Square Max Hymans.
The Sabena deal, which was completed last week, involves Air France and its
Belgian financial partners injecting BFr6bn (Dollars 29.4m) into the Belgian
airline in return for a 37.5 per cent stake.
In addition the Belgian government will invest BFr9bn in Sabena.
The deal also involves forging commercial and managerial links between the
two airlines.
Air France's investment in Sabena forms the latest part of its long-term
strategy of broadening the base of its business across the international
airline industry.
Earlier this year Air France led a consortium of investors to take a 40 per
cent stake in Ceskeslovenske Aerolinie (CSA), the Czechoslovakian state
airline, in a Dollars 60m deal.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
DEERE &amp; CO, the troubled US construction equipment maker, has pulled out of
the three-way alliance with Fiat of Italy and Hitachi Construction Machinery
of Japan.
The decision has thrown into doubt the future of the deal, which was seen as
a response by three leading construction equipment makers to the crisis
facing their recession-hit industry.
The US group said the agreement signed in November last year to explore a
joint venture stipulated that a final decision on the accord would be made
after a period of evaluation and discussion.
'As a result of that evaluation, we decided that it was not in the interest
of Deere &amp; Co to proceed,' the company said.
Hitachi confirmed that it would continue discussions with Fiat but would not
elaborate. Fiat, which may have the most to lose from the Deere move, said
the two remaining partners, which already had a joint venture arrangement
before the latest deal, had decided to press ahead.
However, they are now likely to change substantially the nature of the
agreement, possibly reducing its scope or even seeking an alternative
partner.
The Fiat-Hitachi-Deere link envisaged the creation of a new company to be
majority-owned by Fiat. The new venture would use the Italian group's
existing sales network in Europe, the Middle East and Africa.
Fiat would have contributed its earth-moving equipment business, which is
partly covered by an existing joint venture with Hitachi, while Hitachi and
Deere would have contributed product and manufacturing expertise to the new
company.
The arrangement was seen as advantageous for all sides as it would have
helped to overcome the severe problems of over-capacity in the industry,
which has already experienced considerable concentration in takeovers and
co-operative ventures. It may even have paved the way for an eventual merger
of the three companies' European construction equipment businesses.
The reasons behind Deere's decision are not known. It is believed that Deere
was unhappy with the distribution arrangements for the backloader that it
was to have contributed to the venture.

<TEXT>
SKANSKA, Scandinavia's largest construction and property company, said
profits for 1991 more than halved, following huge write-downs on properties
and share investments.
The Swedish group's profit after financial items plummeted to SKr1bn
(Dollars 168m) last year - from SKr2.36bn in 1990 - after write-downs
amounting to SKr1.47bn.
Skanska proposed raising the dividend to SKr3.25 from SKr3.13 and said it
did not expect profit after financial items for 1992 to fall below the 1991
level of SKr1.001bn.
Group revenue dropped by 10 per cent to SKr33.55bn in 1991, with revenue
from the contracting operations falling 13 per cent to SKr30.4bn. Skanska's
rental revenue, both from development properties and from property
management, increased to SKr3.12bn from SKr2.43bn.
The fall in real estate prices - both in Sweden and abroad - has forced
Skanska to write down its development and investment properties by a total
of SKr1.15bn.
Standard &amp; Poor's, the US credit rating agency, yesterday placed the ratings
of Skandia, Hafnia and Uni Storebrand on CreditWatch following last week's
announced deal between the three Scandinavian insurance groups.
Under the proposed deal, Skandia of Sweden will take over Hafnia of Denmark
and will sell most of its own international reinsurance business to Uni
Storebrand of Norway.
S&amp;P has placed Skandia International Insurance's AA claims paying ability,
AA senior debt rating and A1 plus commercial paper rating on CreditWatch
with negative implications.
Uni Storebrand's A1 commercial paper rating has been placed on CreditWatch
with negative implications.
Hafnia Insurance Group's A claims-paying ability and its merchant bank's A2
Eurocommercial paper rating have been placed on CreditWatch with developing
implications, which means they could be either raised or lowered. S&amp;P said
the proposed takeover was likely to be positive for Hafnia.

<TEXT>
STRONG profits growth in Fortis's life, accident and health insurance
businesses helped the Dutch-Belgian insurance company to an Ecu408m (Dollars
331.7m) net profit last year, up 3.7 per cent on the 1990 figure of Ecu393m.
Fortis - formed in 1990 from a merger of the activities of Amev, the
Netherlands' third largest insurer, and Groupe AG, Belgium's largest
insurance company - said it expected operating profits to rise again in
1992.
Amev is proposing an increased dividend of Fl 3 a share, up from Fl 2.85,
while Groupe AG expects to pay BFr46 a share, against BFr41.25 last time.
Mr Maurice Lippens, co-chairman of Fortis, especially welcomed the
'spectacular results' of Amev's recently established venture with VSB, the
largest Dutch savings bank and a Fortis subsidiary, to sell insurance
products through its branches.
Fortis is becoming increasingly involved in the growing bank-insurance
sector. AG and Generale de Banque of Belgium are in talks about a deal
similar to that with VSB. Mr Lippens, who is also chairman of AG, would not
be drawn on the details or the progress of the talks, though he underlined
their difficulties.
Operating profit in the life insurance sector rose by nearly 17 per cent to
Ecu147m, from Ecu126m the previous year.
Operating profit in accident and health insurance rose to Ecu73.9m, against
Ecu58.1m. Only poor results from the Spanish car and fire insurance
operations and from the group's City of London subsidiary - since closed -
held back the insurance operation's profits.
Profit from banking activities rose from Ecu37.2m to Ecu53.8m, of which
Ecu51.2m was interest on group equity, compared with Ecu46.5m.
The group's total revenues increased by 19 per cent to Ecu7.47bn from
Ecu6.3bn.

POLISH investors learnt a bitter lesson about small shareholders' influence
over company policy at the first annual meeting of Wedel, the confectionery
producer which is 40 per cent owned by PepsiCo Foods International, the US
food snacks concern.
About 200 shareholders turned up at the annual meeting, many of them angry
that Wedel had decided not to pay a dividend out of its 1991 profit of Zl
163bn (Dollars 12.2m).
It was left to Mr James O'Neil, who heads PepsiCo Foods' north European
division, to field repeated questions about the dividend decision. 'It would
almost be a sin to take profits from this company and not invest them,' he
said.
PepsiCo itself was investing a further Dollars 17m in the business this year
or Dollars 2m more than expected under a five-year Dollars 56m
capital-spending plan, he explained.
The shareholders' plea was for a symbolic dividend or an undertaking that
dividends would be paid within two years.
'It's not that you haven't made yourself sufficiently clear but it's that we
don't agree with your decision,' a Polish investor replied to Mr O'Neil's
explanation.
Mr O Neil, who had not spent 25 years in the salty snacks business to let an
angry group of investors faze him, tried another tack. 'All I can say is
that the dividend question will be reviewed each year,' he said.
Under the voting system, weighted toward the board, it received 6.9m votes
while the shareholders managed to muster 43,141. The Polish government,
which holds 1.14m votes, voted with PepsiCo.
The small shareholders did not hide their disappointment. 'We took part in
staged meetings like this for 45 years knowing that there was absolutely no
point to them,' said one, remembering the communist past.

The ending of the Gulf war and the demise of the International Leisure Group
brought a surge of bookings to Airbreak Leisure Group, a tour operator.
As a result pre-tax profit for 1991 came to Pounds 1.63m, compared with
Pounds 1.5m forecast in the prospectus last August and with Pounds 711,000
achieved in 1990.
Sales for the current year were holding up strongly, said Mr David Lewis,
chairman. The acquisition of Sunsail International in February is expected
to make a notable contribution, along with a full year's benefit from
Goldcrest Aviation, the joint venture with Champion Holdings.
Turnover expanded to Pounds 43.2m (Pounds 18.8m) and the operating profit
increased to Pounds 1.6m, against Pounds 709,000 struck after Pounds 360,000
exceptional costs.
Earnings per share came to 5.92p (1.74p) and the dividend is 1.3125p as
forecast.
Following introduction to the USM, a further Pounds 2m cash subscription was
entered into by Champion, combined with the joint venture.

FT  16 APR 92 / UK Company News: Alexander Russell optimistic of growth
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Alexander Russell, the quarrying, concrete and coal group, recorded a 9 per
cent drop in pre-tax profit for 1991.
This is the second year of downturn but 'we believe that growth has now
resumed and will carry on strongly for many years to come', said Mr Russell
Nicholson, chairman.
Sales slipped to Pounds 37.7m (Pounds 38.8m) and profit fell to Pounds 1.66m
(Pounds 1.83m) on a restated basis. Expenditure on rationalisation and
closure of business in 1990 has been charged as exceptional, rather than
extraordinary.
Mr Nicholson said the reduction in quarrying turnover was limited to 6 per
cent and profits to 14 per cent.
In concrete, profits were up 5 per cent mainly because of an excellent
performance of the roof tile business. The opening of the Burton-on-Trent
plant increased tile sales substantially.
Profits from the coal division were much improved. Rationalisation was
nearing completion and had reached a level where steady profits were
expected.
Earnings per share were 2.59p (3.51p) basic and 3.32p (3.77p) fully diluted.
The final dividend is 1.15p for an unchanged total of 2.15p.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Barlows, the property investor and developer, incurred a pre-tax loss of
Pounds 339,000 for 1991 compared with a profit of Pounds 415,000 for the
previous year.
Turnover was little changed at Pounds 2m against Pounds 2.1m.
Net losses were 0.77p per share (earnings 1.23p) but the dividend total is
maintained 2.475p with a proposed final of 1.65p.
Directors said 1991 had been a difficult year. However borrowings had been
reduced, liquidity was firmly under control, interest was capped, and since
the year end significant lettings had been achieved.

<TEXT>
LOSSES AT Newarthill, the family-controlled holding company for the civil
engineer Sir Robert McAlpine, jumped from Pounds 6.2m to Pounds 42.8m in the
12 months to October 31.
The company turned round to a trading loss of Pounds 10.5m, against a profit
of Pounds 3.68m, and provided an exceptional Pounds 25m for writing down the
value of the property joint venture in Leicester.
Directors said the construction operations were profitable but the
performance of the Australian property interests was the main contributor to
the loss.
The financial reconstruction in Australia had been finalised; it entailed a
contingent debt/equity swap under which no interest was payable for the next
five years.
Below the line the company provided Pounds 33.5m for diminution in value of
fixed assets investments and properties and for contingent liabilities, to
leave an attributable loss of Pounds 71.8m (profit Pounds 12.6m). Losses per
share were 287.2p (80.7p).

FT  16 APR 92 / UK Company News: Allied-Lyons aims to lick Russian ice-cream
market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP RAWSTORNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ALLIED-LYONS, the drinks, food, and retailing group, has formed a joint
venture with the Russian ministry of trade to build a Pounds 30m ice-cream
manufacturing plant in the republic.
Work began yesterday on the factory which, from early 1994, will produce 8m
gallons of ice-cream a year to supply Allied's expanding chain of
Baskin-Robbins stores in Russia.
Agreements have been signed with 10 dairy farms in the Ruza region to supply
the factory with milk and cream. Technical support will be given to the milk
producers and equipment for the factory will be supplied by APV, another UK
company.
Baskin-Robbins opened its first franchised store in Russia four years ago.
It now operates five stores in Moscow and four more are opening in St
Petersburg, Zelenograd and Novgorod. Ice-cream is shipped to the stores at
present from the US.
Mr Tony Hales, Allied's chief executive, said yesterday: 'We are conscious
of the current economic difficulties the Russians are encountering and hope
that this move, which offers both technical and financial assistance, will
contribute to the rebuilding process.'
Allied was establishing 'a promising position' in eastern Europe, and the
group intended to develop further joint ventures, he added.

FT  16 APR 92 / UK Company News: US reorganisation sparks recovery at Tie
Rack
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TIE RACK, the specialist tie, scarf and fashion accessories retailer,
yesterday reported a sharp improvement in profits and a return to the
dividend list.
Pre-tax profits in the year to February 2 rose from Pounds 51,000 to Pounds
1.03m on sales up 1 per cent at Pounds 54.5m.
Last June's rights issue and a 29 per cent fall in stock levels helped turn
net borrowings of Pounds 6.3m into net cash of Pounds 3.2m. Interest charges
fell from Pounds 1.75m to Pounds 539,000.
The company also enjoyed a sharp reduction in the tax rate, following a
favourable ruling by the Inland Revenue that the loss-making US operation
was domiciled for tax purposes in the UK.
This helped reverse losses of 1.79p to earnings of 1.99p per share. The
company is to pay a 0.5p dividend, in line with its forecast at the time of
the rights issue, having passed the interim.
Mr Roy Bishko, chairman, said the results reflected progress made in
reorganising the US business which had not made a profit since it was
launched in 1986. The profits increase, after a Pounds 504,00 exceptional
charge for reorganisation, reflected tight management control of current and
capital expenditures.
The group also changed the profile of its businesses during the year. At the
year-end, only 78 of 257 shops were franchised, compared with 111 of 253 the
year before. While this had removed a number of poor performing franchises
from the system, the company was still committed to franchising if the
individuals concerned were well financed and fully involved in the running
of the companies.
On the trading side, the first quarter had been badly hit in the UK by the
Gulf war's impact on airport and central London sales. Trading since then
had been erratic and operating profits were down from Pounds 3.5m to Pounds
2.84m. In the US, the loss fell from Pounds 1.23m to Pounds 856,000 while in
non-UK Europe, profits fell from Pounds 1.22m to Pounds 1.08m.

underwriting losses

   DUBLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AGF-IRISH Life Holdings, Ireland's largest composite insurance group,
reported pre-tax profits of IPounds 7.3m (Pounds 6.68m sterling) for the
year to December 31, its first as a consolidated group.
Underwriting losses were IPounds 18.7m on gross premium income of IPounds
171m, while investment income amounted to IPounds 26m. In common with most
of the non-life insurance companies in Ireland, underwriting losses are now
a fact of life, offset by investment income accruing from the cashflow of
premium turnover.
Mr John O'Hanlon, group chief executive, said underwriting losses in the
motor sector had been reduced in the past year as a result of rerating 'but
we have not seen a similar improvement in ratings in other sectors.
There has been no mitigation in the level of awards and we continue to see
claims inflation, in excess of the overall inflation level'.
The group was formed in July 1990 by Assurances Generales de France (AGF)
and Irish Life, Ireland's largest life assurance company, to consolidate
their interests in the Irish non-life insurance market.
They acquired the Irish business of the Insurance Corporation of Ireland in
July 1990, and all of the issued share capital of Church and General
Insurance in June 1991.
AGF owns 66.3 per cent of the group, and Irish Life holds 30.4 per cent. The
balance is held by former minority shareholders in Church and General.
The group now has 14 per cent of the general insurance market in Ireland,
accounting for 24 per cent of the liability insurance, 9 per cent of the
motor insurance, 63 per cent in international, marine and aviation and 13
per cent in property.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR RICHARD Heley and Bernando will be competing today.
As the bay horse prances around the dressage ring, his rider will look cool,
calm and collected whatever is happening beneath him, writes Maggie Urry.
It is a skill Mr Heley, who is head of corporate finance at Hill Samuel, the
merchant bank, has perfected over the months since being appointed by Brent
Walker in September 1990.
He has been the chief architect of the financial side of the group's rescue.
His current holiday is only the second he has had since he took on the
gargantuan task. The first, in Italy last July, was accompanied by a fax
machine which was put out of action for four days by a Tuscan thunderstorm
causing considerable frustration back at the office.
Mr Heley says his two children still recognise him despite his late nights
at work and non-appearance at many school functions. His horse has
blossomed, reaching the regional finals last year in both the novice and
elementary classes for dressage, even though weekend competitions were often
squeezed between Brent Walker meetings in the morning and evening.
Unfortunately he cannot say how many hours work was involved in Brent
Walker.
'We made a fundamental error at an early stage,' he admits. Hill Samuel
agreed to work for a fixed fee rather than an hourly rate.
The two hardest periods were the seven weeks running up to the standstill
agreement reached with the banks in November 1990 and the weeks between
mid-February and June 7 last year when the proposals were put to the banks.
Then he was working at least 18 hours a day, seven days a week.
The work was even tougher on Hill Samuel's computer. There is nothing more
frustrating at 3am, Mr Heley says, than trying to put the next variant into
a 10-year cashflow projection model only to find that the computer's
capacity has been completely used.
Hill Samuel has re-equipped the department though, and is hoping to pick up
business from the other corporate restructurings now taking place.
'Brent Walker was the first one that went the full course,' he says, 'so
Hill Samuel has developed skills which others will find useful.'
One lesson he has learned - next time he will be charging by the hour.

FT  16 APR 92 / UK Company News: Smiths hints of expansion plans - Difficult
trading conditions in aerospace side cut profits to Pounds 44.3m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SMITHS INDUSTRIES, the UK defence and aerospace components group, which has
net cash of Pounds 95m, yesterday hinted that it was preparing to go on the
acquisition trail.
Mr Roger Hurn, chairman and chief executive, told analysts the group's
management was ready for 'a major challenge'.
Although not ruling out anything, it seems likely Smiths would seek to
diversify away from the defence and civil aerospace sectors. The group has a
high reputation in the City and could easily issue more shares for a
takeover.
Difficult trading conditions in aerospace were blamed for a 12.5 per cent
drop in pre-tax profits to Pounds 44.3m (Pounds 50.7m) in the six months to
February 1, even though turnover rose from Pounds 288m to Pounds 307.4m.
Medical systems lifted trading profits by 17 per cent to Pounds 11.6m and
industrial profits rose to Pounds 8m (Pounds 7.1m), boosted by a US
acquisition.
Turnover in aerospace was slightly down at Pounds 184m (Pounds 186m) and
trading profits fell from Pounds 24.6m to Pounds 18.2m. Smiths said it did
well to achieve profit margins of almost 10 per cent against a background of
defence cuts and reduced demand from large airlines.
The group this week announced 450 redundancies among aerospace workers in
the US and UK. Its overall workforce has been cut from 13,500 to 11,200 in
the past two years.
Mr Hurn said he hoped this would be the final round of job cuts in the
present recession.
Best performer was medical systems, which raised sales to Pounds 63.8m
(Pounds 56.8m) and trading profits to Pounds 11.6m (Pounds 9.9m).
European and North American operations performed strongly, and Middle
Eastern markets recovered. Eastern Europe was also generating firm orders.
The industrial side lifted turnover to Pounds 59.6m (Pounds 45.2m) and
trading profit to Pounds 8m (Pounds 7.1m). This expansion was helped by the
Pounds 33m acquisition of Flexible Technologies, a US manufacturer of hoses,
pipes and flexible connectors, which made a significant contribution after
financing costs and increased its share of a depressed market.
The other industrial businesses performed creditably, with encouraging
results from the UK engineering companies.
Earnings per share fell to 10.1p (11.4p) but the interim dividend is 4.1p
(3.9p).
COMMENT
What would Smiths buy? Market speculation has for some time singled out
Dowty, the aerospace components manufacturer, but most observers think
Smiths wants to reduce, not increase, its exposure to the woes of defence
and civil aviation. Medical systems has proved a very lucrative niche, but
would be expensive to expand by acquisition, rather than continued organic
growth. The success of last year's Flexible Technologies purchase suggests
industrial companies will provide the happiest hunting ground, with no
shortage of recession-struck targets. Smiths is currently forecast to earn
Pounds 109m this year, which puts the shares - up 16p to 309p - on a modest
multiple of 12.4. The high regard in which Mr Hurn and his team are held in
the City does not outweigh general pessimism about the outlook for defence
and civil aviation. Some analysts consider the shares are already good
value, but they are unlikely to enjoy a significant re-rating until the
acquisition intentions are clearer.

provisions

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HELICAL BAR, the property development, investment and trading company,
reported a pre-tax loss of Pounds 6.49m for the year to January 31 compared
with a profit of Pounds 2.71m.
The loss was struck after an exceptional charge of Pounds 4.62m relating to
provisions at its London properties in City Road.
Interest payable fell from Pounds 21.4m to Pounds 16.7m as borrowings
dropped because of the sale of properties worth Pounds 47m.
Extraordinary losses on sales of investment properties were Pounds 216,000
before tax.
Turnover declined to Pounds 31.1m (Pounds 74.7m) and rental income fell from
Pounds 18.8m to Pounds 16.5m.
The group warned that the property industry in the south-east would continue
to be depressed for the rest of the year. However, the bulk of the group's
properties are in the north-east and West Midlands, which have shown signs
of recovery.
Losses per share were 35.4p (earnings of 7.8p) and the final dividend is cut
to 1.6p (7.6p) making a total of 4p (10p).

FT  16 APR 92 / UK Company News: Trade Indemnity under pressure as Dutch
insurer enters market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HEIGHTENED competition for the trade credit insurance custom of the UK's
biggest companies is on the cards following the entry into the market
yesterday of Nederlandsche Credietverzekering Maatschappij (NCM), the Dutch
export credit insurer.
The news will bring further pressure to Trade Indemnity, the trade credit
insurer, whose 82 per cent plus market share could come under threat.
NCM, which has previously traded in the UK from its Dutch base, established
a new UK subsidiary, NCM Credit Insurance, following its purchase of the
privatised Insurance Services Group last December.
A dominant force in Dutch domestic and UK and Dutch export credit insurance,
NCM now intends to establish a sizeable market share in the UK domestic
market.
'We haven't entered this market to be a marginal player,' said Mr Colin
Foxall, managing director and chief executive.
NCM hoped eventually to offer domestic credit insurance to many of the 6,000
UK companies to which it already sells export credit insurance.
'We are entering the market because our customers have pressed us to do so,'
added Mr Foxall.
'One third of our customers already buy domestic credit insurance. We'd
expect that large numbers would want at least a quote from us.'
NCM said that it hopes to expand principally by selling to companies that
are currently uninsured. 'We want to raise the awareness of the usefulness
of the product,' said Mr Foxall.
No more than 7 per cent of GDP is insured in the UK, compared with as much
as 20 per cent in the Netherlands, Mr Foxall said yesterday.
Even so the new competition could spell problems for Trade Indemnity, which
has a had a tumultuous time in the past two years.
The company has been hard hit from claims as a result of the recession and
last month announced pre-tax losses of Pounds 46.6m for 1991, compared with
Pounds 28.8m in 1990. The group passed its dividend last year.
A decline in its share price from 93p last March to only 45p at yesterday's
close has wiped out more than half the group's market capitalisation.
NCM claims that its package is 'unique' in the UK. Claimants face no waiting
period and payment is effected immediately upon ascertaining insolvency.
Liability is based on the amount owing under the contract, not the amount
accepted in the insolvent estate, and recoveries are calculated from the
date of insolvency and not from the date of notification.

FT  16 APR 92 / UK Company News: Macmillan is refused Berlitz injunction
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND HUGHES, Law Courts Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MACMILLAN, the main pub-lishing subsidiary of the insolvent Maxwell
Communications Corporation, was yesterday refused an injunction stopping
four banks selling shares in Berlitz, the language company, pending the
trial later this year to resolve a dispute over ownership of the shares.
A High Court judge decided that, because of the volatility of the Berlitz
share price, an injunction could harm the banks more than the refusal of an
order would damage Macmillan.
However, after making his ruling, Mr Justice Hoffmann agreed that if
Macmillan could, within 24 hours, raise the money needed to cover the banks
against a Dollars 4 (220p) drop in the current share price - calculated by
Macmillan at Dollars 17.5m - it could have an injunction.
In November 1990 Macmillan's 56 per cent holding in Berlitz was transferred
to Bishopsgate Investment Trust, a private company in the Maxwell group, at
the instigation of the late Mr Robert Maxwell and his son Kevin. Some of the
10.6m shares were subsequently pledged to banks to secure loans to other
Maxwell companies.
The court was concerned with 1.9m shares held by Shearson Lehman Brothers
Holdings, 2.4m by Swiss Volksbank, 1.5m by Credit Suisse and 3.3m by Morgan
Stanley Trust Company.
Morgan Stanley did not claim to own its holding and did not oppose an
injunction.
The judge said the other banks questioned Macmillan's ability to pay them
damages if it was granted an injunction but lost at trial. Although
Macmillan's latest balance sheet showed a Dollars 162m excess of assets over
liabilities that was rapidly being eroded by losses.
In the year to March 31 the net loss had been Dollars 277m. Assets included
Dollars 1.5bn representing goodwill, and Dollars 221m for the value of the
Berlitz shares, ownership of about half of which was in dispute.
The judge said the Berlitz share price had ranged between Dollars 12.5 and
Dollars 20 in the last two years. He concluded that the likelihood of market
fluctuations causing loss to the banks was a great deal higher than any risk
of a loss of profit to Macmillan.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
INCREASED sales for all of its products in the domestic market helped Golden
Vale, the County Cork-based dairy produce group, lift pre-tax profits by 18
per cent to IPounds 14.7m (Pounds 13.4m) in 1991.
The advance from IPounds 12.5m was achieved on turnover up 41 per cent at
IPounds 295.5m (IPounds 209.7m). Increased borrowings of IPounds 20.8m at
the year-end gave gearing of 28.2 per cent (nil).
Group operating profits totalled IPounds 15.2m (IPounds 12.7m). The share of
profits of associated companies rose to IPounds 1.34m (IPounds 484,000),
though net interest payable increased to IPounds 1.79m (IPounds 775,000).
Earnings per share improved to 8.54p (7.47p) and the final dividend is
lifted to a proposed 0.94p for a total of 1.36p (1.14p).

FT  16 APR 92 / UK Company News: Forte falls to Pounds 73m as hotels and
restaurants feel the pinch
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FORTE, the hotels, contract catering and restaurants group, announced
pre-tax profits of Pounds 73m for the year ended January 31 1992, compared
to Pounds 190m last time.
Turnover rose 1 per cent to Pounds 2.6bn which, the company said, was wholly
attributable to a 10 per cent sales growth in its contract catering
business.
A final dividend of 7.16p brings the total to an unchanged 9.91p. Earnings
per share were 6p (18.8p), which meant dividend cover fell from 1.9 to 0.6
times.
Trading profit in hotels fell 53 per cent to Pounds 75m on sales down 8 per
cent to Pounds 835m.
Profits from contract catering rose 18 per cent to Pounds 47m on sales up 10
per cent to Pounds 1.1bn. Forte said its business benefited from companies
in the private sector attempting to reduce costs by bringing in contract
caterers. Public sector work also rose with increased contracting out of
catering in schools, hospitals and defence establishments.
Profits from restaurants fell 15 per cent to Pounds 63m on sales down 1 per
cent to Pounds 638m. Kentucky Fried Chicken and Wheelers had a difficult
year, particularly in areas which rely on tourism for a large proportion of
their income.
Welcome Break motorway service areas were affected by a decline in traffic
volumes. The Little Chef, Happy Eater and Harvester chains proved more
resilient.
The group said measures such as short-time working had saved Pounds 21m in
variable costs. It had also made fixed-cost savings of Pounds 40m.
Certain costs increased sharply, however. Business rates and the need to
absorb increases in value added tax had cost about Pounds 25m in lost
profit.
Pre-tax profits at the Savoy Group for the year to end-December fell 78 per
cent to Pounds 2.3m on turnover down 14 per cent to Pounds 79.2m. A tax
credit of Pounds 2.7m arising from the writing-back of over-provisions for
corporation tax in previous years and from a reduction in the provision for
deferred taxation resulted in profits after tax of Pounds 5m (Pounds 8.2m).
Earnings per A share fell to 17.5p (28.8p). The dividend is unchanged at 7p.

FT  16 APR 92 / UK Company News: Haden MacLellan tumbles to Pounds 14.6m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HADEN MACLELLAN Holdings, the industrial conglomerate, suffered difficult
trading conditions in its main markets and saw pre-tax profits fall from
Pounds 23.6m to Pounds 14.6m in 1991.
UK profits fell sharply while the US side dropped into losses.
However, directors recommended a maintained final dividend of 5p giving an
unchanged total of 8p, covered 1.4 times by earnings per share of 11p (20p).
Mr Philip Ling, non-executive chairman, said that there were as yet 'no
clear signs of an upturn' in business.
Group sales fell marginally to Pounds 352.2m (Pounds 354.5m) but an increase
in costs reduced cut operating profits to Pounds 14.5m (Pounds 25.7m).
Associate companies incurred a loss of Pounds 264,000 (profit Pounds
576,000).
However, there was interest received of Pounds 369,000, compared to a charge
of Pounds 2.6m. Cash balances stood at Pounds 18.2m at the year-end, up from
Pounds 12.8m.
After a tax bill increased to Pounds 4.4m (Pounds 6.8m), minorities of
Pounds 179,000 (Pounds 191,000), an extraordinary charge of Pounds 2.5m
(Pounds 1.2m) - relating to the possible closure of a paint recycling centre
in the US - and dividend costs, the group added a mere Pounds 100,000 to
reserves, against Pounds 8.3m last time.
Operating profits from the manufacturing division, where the products range
from vandal-proof toilets to iron bridges, were more than halved to Pounds
2.6m (Pounds 5.5m) as inquiries from customers failed to turn into orders.
Mr Ling said that so far in 1992 the inquiry level was high but there was
still no sign of orders improving.
Operating profits from distribution businesses - supplying nuts and bolts,
machine tools and spares for agricultural equipment - fell by a quarter,
from Pounds 5.3m to Pounds 4m, partly as a result of the disposal of the
Rubber and Allied Products group.
A strong performance was seen in the European and Australian parts of the
automated manufacturing systems division where profits advanced from Pounds
7.3m to Pounds 9.9m, benefiting from the completion of two significant paint
systems contracts.
Mr Ling warned it would not be possible to repeat the 1991 figure in 1992.
In the US there was a loss of Pounds 1.8m (profit Pounds 5.5m) and
management changes were being made.
COMMENT
These results were a surprise to no-one but are nevertheless a
disappointment. They must mark the end of the great hopes for the Drypure
paint recycling system, and they show how recession has exposed the
weaknesses of the US management. Costs have been cut, but with the end of
the two big orders in Europe, and no sign of orders picking up yet, it would
be prudent to expect no more than maintained profits and earnings in the
current year. The saving grace is that the group's cash-generative abilities
mean the dividend is safe. And with the shares unchanged yesterday at 120
1/2 p, the yield is 8.9 per cent.

FT  16 APR 92 / UK Company News: Blue Circle falls 51% to Pounds 124m: Sharp
drop in demand experienced in main markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BLUE CIRCLE Industries, the cement and building products group, suffered
sharp falls in demand in the UK and US, its main markets, and profits
dropped from Pounds 195m to Pounds 124.2m before tax in 1991.
Mr Jim McColgan, managing director, said that the year had turned out worse
than expected and proved one of the most difficult in business history. So
far there were few signs of economic improvement in the UK and US. The
shares fell 13p to 272p.
The 36 per cent profit drop was on sales down 8.3 per cent to Pounds 1.1bn.
Operating profits, after an exceptional item of Pounds 16.5m, fell a quarter
to Pounds 147m, and there was a rise in interest payable from Pounds 1.1m to
Pounds 22.8m.
The dividend is maintained at 11.25p with a proposed final of 7.5p. The
dividend is covered by fully diluted earnings per share of 13.6p (22.9p).
However, an extraordinary charge of Pounds 26m covering the losses and costs
of disposing of the garden products business, meant there was a retained
loss of Pounds 12.2m (profit Pounds 53m).
A 17 per cent drop in UK cement volumes caused operating profits in that
division to halve to Pounds 32.9m after Pounds 8m of redundancy costs.
A full year's contribution from BCI's 50 per cent owned Danish cement
company was Pounds 2.5m (Pounds 1.1m). In the US cement operating profits
fell 38 per cent to Pounds 11.5m.
These difficult markets were partly offset by strong demand in Chile and
Malaysia.
Chilean profits were up 16 per cent to Pounds 14.8m, of which Pounds 5.5m
(Pounds 3.7m) was returned to the UK.
Malaysian profits were up a third to Pounds 16m, with Pounds 5.2m (Pounds
7.5m) cash sent to the UK. In Africa, weaker demand in South Africa cut
profits from Pounds 19.2m to Pounds 17.7m. The South African associate has
been sold since the year end. Cash returned to the UK was Pounds 5.4m
(Pounds 5.8m).
The home products division, which BCI has been building up through
acquisitions, almost maintained profits at Pounds 42.6m (Pounds 42.9m)
although this included a Pounds 6.4m pension credit.
The Potterton Myson heating side increased profits, but the Armitage Shanks
bathrooms business bore a Pounds 7.5m exceptional provision against the
costs of closing a factory. A full year from the Italian sanitaryware
company bought in July 1990 meant higher profits there. The New World gas
cooker subsidiary cut its losses.
The property division saw profits fall from Pounds 15.3m to Pounds 11.6m
with both commercial and residential property down.
There was a Pounds 44.2m increase in borrowings, as cash flow from
operations failed to cover capital expenditure and acquisitions.
The depreciation charge of Pounds 78m compared with Pounds 74m of capital
expenditure. At the year end net borrowings were Pounds 305.7m excluding the
Pounds 90m convertible capital bond.

FT  16 APR 92 / UK Company News: Sales decline as Tarmac slumps to Pounds
21m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CONTINUING HIGH overheads set against declining sales were largely to blame
for yesterday's poor results from Tarmac, the quarry products, construction
and properties company.
Pre-tax profits slumped from Pounds 190.7m to Pounds 21m following
exceptional charges of Pounds 45m, including a Pounds 12m charge against the
Channel tunnel and Pounds 10m for falling land values.
Provisions of Pounds 18m for future rationalisation in the industrial and
building products divisions were also made, while there was an exceptional
profit of Pounds 6m on the sale of founder warrants in Eurotunnel.
Turnover fell 11 per cent to Pounds 3.23bn, slightly ahead of the
construction industry's estimated 10 per cent decline.
Operating profits dropped to Pounds 117m (Pounds 267m) while operating
margins fell from 7.4 per cent to 3.6 per cent due to the volume declines
and price competition.
Quarry products contained the decline in operating profits to Pounds 52.9m
(Pounds 80m) despite price competition. Construction also performed well,
increasing operating profits slightly to Pounds 40.8m (Pounds 40m) and
maintaining market share.
Capital expenditure was cut from Pounds 110m to Pounds 40m while
depreciation increased slightly to Pounds 68.3m (Pounds 60.3m).
Net cash outflows were contained to Pounds 10.3m due to improved working
capital controls, including a Pounds 125m reduction in the housing division.
The interest charge fell to Pounds 49.4m (Pounds 76.4m) due to lower
financing costs, principally in the US, but net debt increased to Pounds
456.9m (Pounds 411.6m) mainly due to exchange rate swings.
The debt/equity ratio increased from 39 per cent to 51 per cent, if auction
market preferred shares are treated as debt, or from 26 per cent to 33 per
cent if treated as equity.
Earnings fell to 0.2p (16.7p). The company is recommending a cut in its
final dividend to 2.5p (8.25p) to make a total of 5.5p (11.25p).
There was a retained loss for the year of Pounds 38.6m (Pounds 59.9m
retained profit).
Shareholders funds fell by Pounds 226.3m due to the uncovered dividend and
to a Pounds 149m downward revaluation of the company's mineral reserves.

FT  16 APR 92 / UK hotel groups report big falls
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EMPTY UK hotel rooms caused full-year pre-tax profits at Forte to fall 62
per cent to Pounds 73m while the Savoy Group fell 78 per cent to Pounds
2.3m.
Forte, whose interests include restaurants and contract catering as well as
hotels, said the Gulf war and the UK and US recessions had combined to make
1991 the worst year in almost a decade for the British hotel business.
Forte said: 'The impact on our large portfolio of London hotels was
particularly dramatic. There were sharp falls in the number of overseas
visitors, particularly from the United States.'
It said profits in its provincial hotels had been hit by cutbacks in the
corporate market, compounded by a decline in leisure travel in the second
half of 1991.
Mr Rocco Forte, chief executive, said occupancy in the group's London hotels
had fallen 20 per cent in the first half of last year and 5 per cent in the
second to give an overall drop for 1991 of 12 per cent.
In the provinces, occupancy fell 4 per cent over the year, with a slightly
bigger drop in the second half. Mr Forte declined to reveal last year's
level of room occupancy.
Mr Giles Shepard, managing director of the Savoy Group, in which Forte holds
69 per cent of the shares and 42.5 per cent of the voting shares, said its
London hotels had an occupancy rate of 60 per cent last year, compared with
more than 70 per cent in 1990.
The Lancaster, the Savoy group's Paris hotel, also suffered a sharp drop in
occupancy levels, from 78 per cent in 1990 to 63 per cent last year.
Mr Forte said he intended to reduce his group's dependence on the UK market
by increasing earnings from hotels abroad. Forte currently earns about 80 of
its hotel trading profit in the UK.
He said the group eventually hoped to gain 50 per cent of hotel trading
profits abroad. 'Our principal thrust is on the Continent. We hope to make
some moves in the not too distant future. We have some clear targets,' he
said.
Mr Shepard said international expansion was not an option for the Savoy
Group, which owns six hotels, five of which are in the UK.

FT  16 APR 92 / Economic Viewpoint: The moral victory that is still to be
won
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SAMUEL BRITTAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The British Labour party, which for all its much vaunted policy reviews,
still remained statist and anti-market, lost the UK election. And I noted
that there was another group of losers as well: the more embittered
Conservative Europhobes who were so obviously sharpening their knives for a
bloodbath against anyone in the Conservative party, or outside it, who had
anything to do with the decision to join the exchange rate mechanism.
The latter argument can wait quite a few months until much more evidence
becomes available of Germany's success in countering the inflationary
effects of reunification, and hence the prospect for European interest
rates.
The day before Good Friday, I want to touch on a more fundamental theme.
This is that the anti-collectivists won the general election, but have yet
to win the moral argument.
The evidence that market capitalism still has to win the moral victory comes
from the contrast between public opinion polls and the actual votes in the
polling booths. A significant margin of people evidently thought that in
some sense Labour policies for increasing the role of the state were right
and respectable and the thing to tell others they supported; but they shied
away from what they feared might be the personal consequences to themselves
and their families of a Labour government.
This feeling of moral inferiority is embedded in that awful proverb: 'Anyone
who is not a socialist before the age of 21 has no heart; and anyone who
remains one after the age of 21 has no head.' Nor is it at all comforting
that, in spite of the collapse of state socialism in the former Soviet
world, that so many of our own intellectuals and artists parade their
leftwing leanings. It is as vulgar to sneer at Islington woman as it is to
sneer at Basildon man. With all respect to David Mellor, a minister of
culture is not the complete answer to the anxieties of artists and authors
about a capitalist environment.
I know the glib answer: that men and women of letters, artists and
musicians, have to live under state socialism to turn against it. It would
be more satisfactory if they could bring themselves to see the moral case
for capitalism without such experiences.
Let me be more specific on two issues. All incomes do not belong to the
state; and two-tier or multi-tier health, education and other services are
inescapable in a free society.
It was the assumption that all incomes belong to the state that was the
ultimate rationale of John Smith's confiscatory Shadow Budget. If we are in
the position of children who are being given portions of pie by a mother,
then the only prima facie fair distribution is equality; and departures from
it have to be justified.
If, on the other hand, adults have obtained their holdings in exchange for
their labours, or through transactions with others, or by a gift or bequest,
then the pie theory does not hold; and it is the compulsory transfer to
others that has to be justified.
The anti-collectivists' case needs to be stated with great care. Rights to
income and property are not facts of nature. They are enforced by agencies
such as the police and courts; they are not unlimited, and they can
gradually change. It is quite legitimate for people to be required after due
political process to hand over a fraction of their income for the provision
of collective services or for redistribution to the poor. But if we want
more of some collective provisions - whether state education or anything
else - then most of us must contribute and not just the better off.
What in the end made the Smith-Kinnock approach immoral rather than moral
was their repeated assurance that they could fund a vast and open-ended
expansion of collective activities without the average family having to pay
any more in tax. The Shadow Budget went beyond even that. The increases in
taxes at the upper end of the income distribution were more than required to
finance the promised increase in pensions and child benefit. The object was
to churn enough money around so that there could be 'more winners than
losers'.
As I tried to explain at the beginning of the campaign, the Smith Shadow
Budget was devastatingly simple in its reasoning. If you have 10 piles of
coins of different heights and take from the two tallest piles to put
something in each of the others, then there will be more gainers than
losers. The Conservatives might have made people fear that there would be
bad side effects, or that Labour would not stop at the one or two tallest
piles. But there was no fundamental challenge to the right of a government
elected on a plurality to indulge in such confiscation.
This collectivist fallacy that our personal property comes from some
mythical entity called the state is enhanced every time any chancellor of
any party boasts of how much his Budget has 'done' for so many people. This
naturally encourages television reporters to go into the pubs and pick up
complaints that 'this Budget has done very little for me' or 'it will all be
taken away by the poll tax', or whatever.
The object of Budgets is not to provide people with something for nothing.
It is to raise money for collectively-provided or financed services. The
state can take more or less for this purpose. It has nothing to give.
To move on. The forces of freedom will not have won the moral battle so long
as they wince when accused of being in favour of 'two-tier' health or
two-tier education. There will always be different levels of provision so
long as people are free to spend their own incomes in their own ways - and
that would be true even if incomes were equal.
Two-tier provision could only be abolished if people were forbidden to
purchase private medicine or private education. In other words, people's
incomes would have to be treated as pocket money which they can spend on
gambling or holidays or restaurant meals, but not on anything they regard as
of prime importance.
The immediate response from the leftwing is the charge of queue-jumping.
Serious cases are supposedly left untreated so that a privately-insured
person can be pampered in a private ward. Here a tiny piece of
microeconomics does help to refute the charge. It all depends on the
'elasticity of supply' of medical services. If the total number of doctors,
nurses, surgical appliances, drugs, and hospital buildings were fixed, then
the leftwing charge would be difficult to answer, like the case for food
rationing in wartime.
But if, as is so obviously the case, the supply of such services is over a
few years responsive to demand, then the willingness of people to pay
themselves for treatment leads to a large expansion. More doctors stay in
this country. Others are attracted here from abroad. More hospitals are
built, and in the end there are more resources devoted to medical purposes.
* * *
The heroic anti-collectivist period of the 1980s is over. Those of us with a
preference for the market and personal over collective choice will have to
make our own case, with governments preferring to avoid high theory. For
there was always a paradox in those who proclaimed the belief in freedom
wanting one person to remain in power for ever and ever, and to amass more
and more centralised authority. We are back to the 1960s in the exciting
sense that the battle of ideas will be fought outside the corridors of
power.

FT  16 APR 92 / Letter: Pension fund managers support reform but warn
against sacrificing proven practices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr C K R NUNNELEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The members of this association, which includes virtually all the
leading independent managers of pension fund assets in the UK, are taking a
close interest in the suggestions for reform of the private occupational
pension fund system following the Maxwell affair.
Although some of the proposed reforms are not of direct relevance to fund
managers, and most of the proposals are still at the preliminary stage,
there are some on which we feel it right to comment now in order to
encourage progress in the right direction.
We fully approve the steps being taken to limit investment in assets
connected with a pension fund's sponsors. We also believe that it is
essential to strengthen the independence and powers of trustees, for example
by adding to their number either suitably qualified individuals, who would
perform a function equivalent to that of non-executive directors, or a trust
company, which might also act as custodian. All trustees should be able to
appeal to a body, such as the Occupational Pensions Board, with enhanced
powers to prevent misuse of a fund's assets.
However, some of the other changes which have been suggested in such areas
as custodial arrangements fail to address the overriding need to improve
protection against fraud and negligence and would have few, if any,
advantages. In particular, the practice, common in the UK, of holding
pension fund assets in the name of a nominee company associated with the
investment manager is efficient and free of risk where suitable
authorisation, systems and controls are in place. Also, although designation
of individual client holdings in a custodian account may superficially seem
attractive, it in fact adds to the cost and complications of administration
without any commensurate improvement in security or increase in control by
the trustees.
Insurance cover has a part to play, but it can never take the place of
preventative measures. All investment management firms have fidelity and
professional indemnity insurance, but the suggestion, made recently in a
letter to the FT (March 26), that they should be required to 'have insurance
cover to at least the total level of funds under management' is neither
sensible nor practicable. If the insurance market could provide cover for
over Pounds 450bn of assets, which it cannot, the cost would be horrendous
(and borne ultimately by the clients). A combination of effective procedures
and reputable agents provides a far better solution.
Above all, trustees can and should ensure that they select managers of good
reputation and that their own system of controls, and those of their agents,
give adequate protection.
They should not rely solely on authorisation by a regulatory agency as a
guarantee of honesty and efficiency but rather on their own investigations
and regular reviews.
The pension fund system has clear shortcomings and fund managers are ready
to play their part in identifying and correcting them. Our members hope,
however, that any pressure to make changes without proper consideration will
be resisted, especially if they entail the sacrifice of cost-effective
practices which have served pension funds well over many years.

FT  16 APR 92 / Letter: EC no part of fish crisis
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr BRUNO DETHOMAS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Mr Eaton (Letters, April 8) misleads your readers by comparing EC North
Atlantic Fisheries Organisation quotas with total EC catches to illustrate
over-fishing, without mentioning that the latter figure includes all stocks
for which fishing is free and there is no NAFO quota (because they are
either commercially uninteresting or not subject to conservation policies).
The EC indeed accepts and complies with every single recommendation by the
NAFO Scientific Council. It does not 'ignore important NAFO conservation
decisions including a moratorium' on fishing for offshore cod. The truth is
that this moratorium is not the result of a scientific recommendation by
NAFO; it does not apply to the Canadian fleet, whose own quota for this area
in 1991 was 185,000 tonnes.
Mr Eaton further implies that EC vessels are using illegal undersized nets.
In fact, EC nets fully comply with NAFO regulations.
Canadian authorities claim that there is a crisis in the offshore fishery
for cod. The EC simply responds that if that is the case, one should not
automatically blame foreign fleets but rather assess the situation and act
on the basis of independent scientific advice. This is why the EC has
already formally requested an extraordinary meeting of the NAFO Scientific
Council to study the cod stock. Unfortunately, Canada has so far rejected
this request saying that its own opinion is enough.
If an independent scientific opinion suggests that the EC fleet is the one
'responsible for the depletion of fish stocks off Newfoundland', the
Commission will be the first to support a moratorium in that area.
In response to a Canadian press campaign, not only the EC but, for the first
time, the EC Council of Ministers has unanimously declared that 'it cannot
accept that the poor state of cod stock . . .be presented as a consequence
of' EC fishing activities. The Community thus shows its unity, its political
goodwill, and its hopes to establish a constructive dialogue with Canada,
not through the press but with a serious effort to find solutions agreed by
all.

Sir, Bryn Jones (Letters April 15) gets it nearly all wrong in his critique
of David Willetts' perceptive and clear article (April 13).
Conservatives believe in open markets which are not the same as free markets
(see Adam Smith). The essential target of good marketing is a satisfied
customer.
That is the Majorite Conservative objective and the Majorite
Conservative/Citizen's Charter approach to improving education, the health
service, the railways, local government etc.
It may not be so cosy for those who are on the payrolls of these

HORACE'S SCHOOL: Redesigning the American High School
By Theodore R Sizer
Houghton Mifflin, Dollars 19.95
Two American public high schools exist in the world's imagination. The first
is the chronically under-funded inner-city school where many pupils drop out
before gaining a diploma. It is dominated by teenage gangs, and its teachers
have lost hope of providing a proper education to its poor, ethnic-minority
pupils.
The second imaginary high school is different. It is in the affluent suburbs
attended by pupils from different backgrounds whose parents want them to go
on to college. It offers an array of academic and vocational courses in
orderly classes. Students cheer for the football team and dream of the
school prom.
The trials of the first American high school are so familiar that it is hard
to envisage the second having problems. Opinion polls find most American
parents are happy with their local school in spite of their worry about the
state of education. They are happy for their children to enjoy its
comfortable traditions.
Yet it is hard to find an education pundit or a business leader who agrees
with them. The suburban high school is attracting more and more of the blame
for America's education malaise. Many of the 'lazy and ill-educated' workers
criticised in Japan are the products of these happy institutions.
The essential charge against the suburban high school is that it encourages
complacency and laziness. Students can wander through the 'shopping mall'
school taking undemanding courses. Outside the 'college prep' track, in
which pupils prepare for college entrance tests by taking optional academic
courses, there is little rigour. Even high achievers may have little
experience in reasoning or applying ideas: the Standard Aptitude Test (SAT)
for college is a multiple choice test of abstract facts.
This litany of complaints has led to attempts to change schools. Being
America, self help and local initiative have played as big a role in reform
as state governments or even school districts. Probably the best known is
the Coalition of Essential Schools led by Ted Sizer, a Brown University
professor.
The coalition was formed in 1984 after Sizer's first panegyric on schools in
Horace's Compromise. He described the problems of a fictional high school
teacher called Horace Smith. In the latest episode, Horace has the chance to
lead a team of teachers redesigning Franklin High School from scratch.
In spite of this rather unsophisticated device, the book feels like an
authentic description of a high school and the tribulations of trying to
reform it. One of the strengths of Sizer's approach is that he concentrates
on teaching methods and curriculum, and shows how pupils can evade serious
learning.
Sizer puts the pupil problem clearly on the first page of the book: 'Many
are lively, well-intentioned and adept at cranking out acceptable test
scores, but they are without the habits of serious thought, respectful
scepticism and curiosity about much of what lies beyond their immediate
lives.'
He attributes much of this to the style of teaching: a traditional method of
learning by rote without much pupil involvement. Instead, he recommends
'learning by conversation' in smaller classes, and the blending of different
subjects so students can understand concepts more practically. This has a
familiar smell to the British reader. Indeed, one curiosity of educational
debate in the US is the support for what the UK government regards with
suspicion as 'progressive'.
It is certainly hard to avoid the view that America might be better off with
schools that encouraged a little more reasoning and a little less
self-confidence. The bustle of ill-directed activity in high schools is a
long way from the 'thoughtful place to teach thoughtful young citizens' that
Sizer wants.
Yet his solution seems less than complete. He recommends that pupils are
tested by 'exhibitions' in which they would have to show a panel how they
achieved solutions to complex multi-disciplinary problems. These
'exhibitions' would be used alongside standardised mass tests to ensure real
learning.
What about simply having better pen and paper tests instead of these
mini-vivas? There is a raging debate about assessment methods in America at
the moment, and most people agree that something better than the SATs could
be devised. Sizer says this idea is pie in the sky because no one will bear
the cost.
But there is also a suspicion that he would prefer to leave matters in the
hands of teachers anyway. He thinks schools can be rebuilt from the inside
by well-intentioned parents and teachers. They do not need the heavy hand of
national testing, or even business involvement in new forms of curriculum.
That may be, but Horace had better act fast. It will not take too many
remarks by Japanese politicians before questions about national achievement
in maths and science overwhelm Sizer's wider concerns about authentic
teaching. Then the teachers and students of all the Franklin Highs will be
in for a rougher time.

FT  16 APR 92 / Leading Article: Gadaffi in the dock
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE MANDATORY sanctions imposed on Libya yesterday by the UN Security
Council were characterised by Mr Douglas Hurd, the British foreign
secretary, as persuasive rather than punitive. It is an important
distinction, since it underlines the difficulties involved in further
increasing the pressure on the regime of Col Muammer Gaddafi as a result of
its alleged involvement in the bombing of the Pan Am airliner over Scotland
in 1988 which killed 270 people.
This crude act of terrorism was universally condemned. The desire to bring
those responsible to justice is powerful. Col Gadaffi has for the past 20
years enjoyed fanning the flames of conflict within the Middle East and
elsewhere in the world, where small groups of violent people have been
encouraged to attack governments disliked by Libya. However the depth of
international distaste for the man and his methods should not be allowed to
dictate the response to the Lockerbie outrage.
The effectiveness of sanctions, including the relatively modest ones just
imposed on Libya, must always depend on the willingness of the international
community to stick to them. The US and British governments, in co-operation
with France which has its own arguments with Libya, have won majority
support within the Security Council for the measures so far adopted. But
they would face far stiffer hurdles in persuading others, including European
friends such as Germany, to impose further sanctions and most especially a
ban on Libyan oil exports.
Alleged criminals
There has already been some unease over the apportionment of blame for the
Lockerbie bombing and the subsequent use of the Security Council as a
vehicle for pursuing alleged criminals. The finger of suspicion, officially
guided, pointed first at Syria and Iran. Sceptics suggested that only after
Iraq's invasion of Kuwait did it become politically more expedient to
concentrate on Libya. The evidence against the two Libyans has been gathered
by British and US intelligence. It is not possible for other governments to
test the strength of that evidence.
By working through the Security Council, Britain and the US are making the
UN body the sole instrument of a policy which, if carried to its conclusion,
could lead to military action against Libya. Considering the scale of the
diplomatic effort needed to put together and hold a common UN position on
achieving the liberation of Kuwait, there can be little chance of that
process being repeated over the extradition of two men from Libya who have
yet to be proven guilty.
Strike out
The US, supported by Britain, can of course strike out alone as it did in
the 1986 bombing raids on Libya. It can be argued that the 1986 raid forced
Col Gadaffi to limit support for terrorism. Equally, Lockerbie might have
been the response to it. US and Israeli military dominance of the region
ensures that such attacks can be carried out with little immediate risk. But
whether that is primarily the message which Washington wants to send the
Middle East - at a time when it believes the opportunity has never been
better for a negotiated settlement to the Arab-Israel conflict - is another
matter.
Arab friends of the west have been trying to find a compromise, not liking
the prospect of sanctions against another Arab state, or of Col Gaddafi
being offered a further opportunity to posture as a defiant leader. The
majority of Arab League members are happy to see Libya restrained but are
concerned about the political impact on their own populations of western
actions which could appear vindictive. As they might note, there are other
identifiable international criminals against whom there is no threat of
prosecution, domestic or international.
The international response to terrorism has always had to be one of
containment rather than direct retribution. The latest UN sanctions
recognise that. Libya should be made to feel the weight of western ostracism
for so long as refuses to surrender the two men and does not co-operate more
broadly in the battle against terrorists. But Britain and the US would need
to think very carefully before adopting harsher measures that fail to win
the backing of their main allies.

FT  16 APR 92 / European puzzle still unsolved: There is no clear or simple
message to be derived from the fragmented results of recent elections
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD MORTIMER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'Men wiser and more learned than I have discerned in history a plot, a
rhythm, a predetermined pattern. These harmonies are concealed from me' - H
A L Fisher, in the preface to his History of Europe (1936).
'No generalisation is ever absolutely true, and neither is that one' - Anon.
The cartoon on the front page of Le Monde summed it up best. It showed Mr
John Major on his soap-box, giving the victory sign. President Francois
Mitterrand and Chancellor Helmut Kohl stand by with black eyes and bloody
noses, holding the empty ballot boxes from their regional elections. 'I told
you, Helmut,' Mr Mitterrand is saying, 'never expect solidarity from the
Brits'.
The British election result makes nonsense of any attempt to discern a clear
pattern in current European politics. If there had been a hung parliament,
with 'fringe' or 'protest' parties holding the balance of power, it would
have been so easy to depict Britain as afflicted by the same 'malaise' as
France, Germany and Italy. There would have been the same dilemmas - whether
to build coalitions or to soldier on with a minority government, daring the
other parties to vote you out - and the same accusations about unholy
alliances, secret deals, or nods and winks to obtain the support, or at
least the abstention, of parties supposedly beyond the pale of
respectability.
As it is, Britain has to be treated as an exception to any sweeping
generalisation about 'the fragmentation of political systems' or 'the crisis
of the traditional governing parties'. At best it may, with the Labour
party's fourth successive election defeat, be taken as an example of 'the
crisis of the left'.
That there is such a crisis no one can dispute. As Stanley Hoffmann, a
veteran American observer of European politics, put it in an interview with
the International Herald Tribune: 'Nowhere do socialists do very well. They
have not recovered from the general loss of faith in a traditional
dirigiste, welfare-state approach, and they haven't been able to find a
substitute.'
It should be noted that the crisis of social democracy antedates the
collapse of communism in the Soviet Union. It was already clearly visible
five years ago. The whole story of the 1980s was that of a revolt against
excessive taxation and regulation, a dismantling of traditional social
democratic policies even though carried out in some countries (notably
France and Spain) under nominally Socialist governments. So it is no good
west European socialists complaining that they have been unfairly tarred
with the brush of Soviet communism. They have been, in some cases, but that
is not the main reason for their discomfiture.
The end of the Cold War has helped to destroy the familiar framework of
party politics, especially in countries like Italy, and to a lesser extent
France, where the Communist party had been a central feature of that
framework since 1945. Together, these two phenomena have undermined the
traditional left-right polarisation which gave post-war European politics
its essential shape. At its simplest, this meant you voted for a left-wing
party if you wanted action by the state to produce a more egalitarian
society, and for a right-wing party if you feared that such action would
encroach unacceptably on your personal freedom.
To that extent, the British election should perhaps be seen as a last gasp
of the old politics rather than an example of the new, because it was still
essentially about the old left-right issue. The Labour party was still
putting forward the old social democratic recipe, albeit in a much
watered-down form, and fear of the consequences of this proved, in the end,
strong enough to give the Conservatives a working majority. In other
countries, the right, deprived of a credible left-wing bogeyman, has begun
to fragment. The governing Christian Democrats lost ground to more radical
right-wing parties in the German Lander elections, and to regional protest
parties in the Italian general election. In the French regional elections,
the mainstream conservative opposition did not benefit as it might have
expected from the Socialist party's debacle, the stray votes going instead
to the far right Front National, to rival ecology parties, and to local
candidates.
Clearly voting systems had something to do with this. Britain's
first-past-the-post system makes it peculiarly difficult for minority
parties to win seats, unless (like Plaid Cymru or the Ulster Unionists, or
in Scotland the Liberal Democrats) their support is heavily concentrated in
a small number of constituencies; and voters are naturally reluctant to
waste their votes on candidates who stand very little chance of being
elected. If last week's election had been held on a proportional system with
party lists, like those on the continent, a more politically 'fragmented'
Britain would almost certainly have emerged. It is certainly striking that
in the French cantonal elections, held at the same time as the regional ones
but on a two-ballot single-member-constituency system, only one seat out of
2,000 was won by the Front National, and only four by ecology candidates,
while the mainstream conservative opposition won a comfortable majority of
the votes cast (53.75 per cent).
So it is premature to conclude, even on the Continent, that the crisis of
the left has produced a general crisis of the right. France still lacks a
single powerful conservative party capable of dominating the political scene
as the Tories do in Britain or the Christian Democrats in Germany and Italy,
but that is an old problem. So long as they can work together, Gaullists and
Giscardiens do provide a credible alternative to the Socialist government,
and they can be pretty confident of winning an overall majority in the next
parliament now that the use of a proportional system to elect it has been
ruled out.
It is where conservatives are already in power, but socialists no longer
offer a credible alternative, that the dangers of fragmentation seem most
acute, especially if proportional voting systems continue to be used. The
test year for Germany will be 1994, when there will be elections for the
Bundestag, the European parliament, and for many state parliaments as well.
For that year, Mr Gerhard Frey, leader of the German People's Union (DVU)
which broke through into the Schleswig-Holstein state parliament last week,
is promising 'a breakthrough on the widest front'. But he may be deluding
himself. The far right is itself fragmented, with Mr Frey and Mr Franz
Schonhuber, whose Republican party made an even more spectacular
breakthrough last week in Baden-Wurttemberg, never missing an opportunity to
put each other down in public. Even united they would be far from certain of
reaching 5 per cent of the national vote, which is required for
representation in the Bundestag.
In Italy, some similar modification of the proportional system may be
adopted before the next elections. But whether that happens or not, it is
much too soon to write the epitaph of Christian Democrat dominance. Although
the Christian Democrats have fallen below 30 per cent of the national vote
for the first time since the war, the much worse fragmentation on the left
has widened the gap between them and their nearest rival, the ex-Communist
party, making it less than ever imaginable that any government could be
formed without them.
Perhaps the most striking feature of Europe's political fragmentation is
that the picture itself is fragmented. Generalisations break down as soon as
one examines each country's circumstances in detail. Even the superficially
similar results in France, Germany and Italy are less similar than they
look. In Germany, the main beneficiary of the government's unpopularity is
the far right; in France the far right shares the spoils with ecology
parties with which it has nothing in common; in Italy the neo-fascist vote
went down, and it seems too facile to lump together the devolutionist,
pro-European Lombard League with xenophobic nationalist parties like the
Front National or the Republikaner.
Nor should one forget those European countries which have not held elections
this year. Neither in Spain nor in the Netherlands is there a sense of
political crisis, or any sign that the extreme right is about to make a
breakthrough. In the Netherlands, it is business as usual, with friction
between the Christian Democrats and their Labour coalition partners. In
Spain, Mr Felipe Gonzalez, the 'Socialist' prime minister, adopts more and
more draconian anti-socialist policies and is more or less reconciled to
losing his overall majority next year, but expects to remain in power by
forming a coalition with a powerful regional bloc (probably the Catalans).
If there is a European 'malaise', no doubt recession and unemployment are
important factors in it. Clearly there is concern about immigration in many
countries, and that is usually associated with unemployment, housing
shortages and high crime rates. Unemployment is indeed unacceptably high
(8.9 per cent in 1991) throughout the Community, but it was higher still in
the mid-1980s (10.8 per cent in 1985). Moreover, the countries with the
highest rates, Spain and Ireland, are not the ones most obviously suffering
from political malaise, still less those where immigration is a burning
topic. (Spain has dealt with the problem simply but effectively by providing
road signs in Arabic, pointing the way to France.)
Economists can make out a case, without much difficulty, that growth
throughout Europe is being held back by high interest rates, which in turn
are dictated by the Bundesbank in its efforts to contain domestic inflation.
Thus we are all paying the price of German unity, through the European
exchange rate mechanism. That would be a good reason for political malaise,
and may partly explain the second thoughts about agreements made at the
European summit at Maastricht last December being expressed in some
countries. But no party made this a main theme of its campaign in any of the
recent elections, and there is no evidence that the connection has yet been
understood by voters. If the recession continues it is unlikely to escape
them much longer. The worst of the malaise may well be yet to come.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Irek Muhkhamedov has recruited nine colleagues from the Royal Ballet to join
him in occasional gala peformances. Nothing wildly original in that, except
that the artists are young and gifted, that Mukhamedov has had the wit to
commission new choreography, and that the presentation is polished, well and
honestly planned.
The example of this week's Stars of the Bolshoy evening - its latter part
mostly circus tricks - serves to highlight the merits of what Mukhamedov
proposed for his troupe's first outing at the Derngate Theatre, Northampton.
(This in itself a wise choice: the theatre has a lively policy in presenting
dance and has built up a knowledgeable audience - who responded ecstatically
to Tuesday's performance).
No scratch orchestra, sawing Minkus into useful lengths, but two fine
pianists (Paul Stobart, Tim Qualtrough) on fine pianos, and, for David
Bintley's new Undine, the young Zoe Mather to play Ravel with grace. The
statutory show-pieces were the Sleeping Beauty duet for Bonnie Moore and the
elegant Sergiu Pobereznik, and Vaganova's Diana and Actaeon, in which
Viviana Durante demonstrated a bright-edged attack, and Mukhamedov in heroic
form and a gold lame mini-skirt roared into the air, making us gasp and
cheer and hope that the stage was big enough to contain dancing of such
scale and physical grandeur.
It was the Royal Ballet's own traditions which shone in the rest of the
evening, with the work of six company choreographers on view - four of them
making pieces for the occasion. From Ashton's The Dream came the final duet
for Titania and Oberon, lovingly done by Bonnie Moore and William Trevitt.
In MacMillan's The Four Seasons, Durante and Mukhamedov blazed, and then
melted into the siesta mood of the 'Summer' pas de deux.
Bintley's Undine was a shimmering view of the water sprite reclaiming her
faithless beloved, and, in Deborah Bull's brilliant dancing, seeming to
glitter with drops of water. Portrait, by the young dancer Matthew Hart, was
a sketch of a mad maestro and his lady - inventive but not fully worked out,
despite sure performances from Larissa Bamber and Luke Heydon. Miss Bamber
was also seen, with Michael Nunn, in an admirably judged duet by William
Tuckett - The Unobtrusive Detail - set to a Chopin nocturne. It offered
unisex dress (black shirts and trousers) but subtle interplay between the
sexes - she dependent; he supportive - and was given with superb
concentration and emotional alertness.
A significant novelty was Ashley Page's Quartet. This uses a Liszt Hungarian
rhapsody, and the insidious curves of the melodic line have brought a
fascinating response from the choreographer. The costumes for the two
couples - Deborah Bull and William Trevitt; Belinda Hatley and Michael Nunn
 -are those designed for Page's Piano at Covent Garden three seasons ago. I
found ideas stated in that ballet - about balance; about the potential of a
distorted academic manner - shown more succinctly and more pungently in this
short piece than in the ambitious (and over-decorated) Piano.
Page has, in his earlier Pursuit and Carmen Arcadiae, started to re-form
(and reform) a classic style. Quartet, by its simplicities as by its
allusiveness, shows how well he can achieve this, and how well his dancers
respond to his probing inventions. One last offering, Kasyan Goleizovsky's
view of the Fledermaus waltz, looked a bit odd: it is Soviet kitsch,
dependent upon a lot of roguishness with a fan, and it lies entirely outside
the experience of British dancers. The gifted Belinda Hatley did what she
could, but it is not a matter worth bothering her pretty head and feet
about. The evening was, in all other respects, a triumph for Mukhamedov and
company.
At the Alhambra Theatre, Bradford, on Saturday April 18.

<TEXT>
The stage is a bare box. Two parallel bars are tracked around the midriff of
its walls; they provide home base for the troupe of male athletes in
jockstraps who emanate out of the action like human ectoplasm. Much of the
time they hang in poetic near-motionlessness from the bars, powdered ghostly
white to evoke figures in a cathedral frieze magicked into dramatic
half-life.
Then, at the faintest hint of obsessive passion or frenzy from the
characters on stage down below, they surge from their eyrie into silent
animation, hovering at the characters' heels like plague dogs, registering
each frisson of disturbance like curves on a demonic seismograph. In the
scene of convent exorcism that forms the opera's finale, they scuttle
through the lines of nuns, taunting and provoking them in sinuous leaps and
bounds, dragging their habits off, staging a mad, controlled riot.
They are devils made theatrical flesh; they are played by the Maryinsky
Acrobatic Troupe from St Petersburg; and they are the central invention of
the Royal Opera's superbly original and imaginatively daring new production
of Prokofiev's fourth opera (shared with the Maryinsky theatre, where it was
first shown last December).
The theme of The Fiery Angel is the demonic possession of its heroine, and
the havoc she wreaks on those who cross her path. By discovering a form at
once material and symbolic for that possession, David Freeman (producer) and
David Roger (designer) have found a method of articulating the supernatural
that proves instantly comprehensible on its own terms, simple and potent in
its music-theatre logic, and capable of rich response on many levels.
Freeman has achieved, indeed, a piece of 'naive' theatre - based upon few
props, plain costumes and an admirably fluid manner of scene-change - that
ranks with the very best of his work in London, and with the most exciting
opera-theatre the city has seen and heard in recent years. The Fiery Angel
has until now counted as perhaps the most significant missing link in the
London chain of 20th-century masterpieces - regularly inserted into and then
removed from the schedules of both London companies, and given previously
only a single Sadler's Wells outing (1965) by the New Opera Company and a
single, magnificent concert performance at last year's Albert Hall Proms.
Beyond all its visual thrills, the success of this first Covent Garden
production lies in the way it forces even the most knowledgeable of Fiery
Angel devotees to re-consider the work's supposed flaws - its discontinuous
plot-unfolding, odd-shaped structure, primitivist approach to
characterisation, and unreasonable demands on singers and players alike.
The staging allows both a 'modern' and a mystery-play context for the figure
of Renata, an irrational, vision-haunted outsider in a rigidly controlled
society; it makes for continuously gripping opera-theatre. No fixed
solutions are contrived for all the difficult questions of theme and
substance, yet all seems lucidly realised. And the music is housed with
electrifying responsiveness.
Freeman is one architect of Tuesday evening's triumph. The other is the
conductor, Edward Downes, who marks his 40th year at the house with this
production, the realisation of a lifelong dream. At last year's Fiery Angel
Prom his mastery over every element of the score was made manifest. In the
theatre that mastery appears more remarkable still.
Any competent conductor could, one feels, have a decent go with the opera's
set-pieces, buzzing with sulphurous thematic material, motor-driven rhythmic
patterns and glamorous, tingling orchestration. It takes a conductor of
Downes's experience and authority to squeeze theatrical juice from the less
obvious features of the score, the light touches of sardonic humour, the
bittersweet lyricism. The finale, that astonishing convent cantata for
soprano voices counterpointed by the bass imprecations of the Inquisitor, is
not just a big blow-out but an inevitable, logical conclusion. The opera
holds together.
The leading couple, Galina Gorchakova (Renata) and Sergey Leiferkus (her
besotted champion Ruprecht), are those of Downes's 1991 concert. The young
Siberian soprano floods the music with tone, ample, lustrous, warm and free,
unflecked by strain, wobble or screech. No one, heaven be thanked, seems to
have alerted her to the notorious voice-killer risks in the role, and so she
just lets it pour out with marvellous ease and vitality.
Leiferkus's artistry is of the most subtle and selfless kind; his darkly
burnished baritone finds moments of deep, finely nuanced beauty in his music
without ever elbowing them vulgarly forward. Ruprecht's pain and despair are
the more eloquent for being understated. In a large cast, Paata
Burchuladze's bull-like, thunderous Inquisitor, Robert Tear's slyly witty
Mephistopheles, the Fortune Teller of Gillian Knight and the Jacob Glock of
John Dobson stand out, but no one detracts from the richness of the overall
impression.
In sum, a brave, powerful, arresting performance - no-one who cares about
opera as theatre will want to miss it.

FT  16 APR 92 / Arts: Berlin Bertie
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD

<TEXT>
Odd how plays of a kind seem to flock together. At the Comedy we have the
Italian anarchic left in Dario Fo's The Pope and the Witch (reviewed
yesterday). At the Royal Court up, or perhaps down, goes the British left in
Howard Brenton's Berlin Bertie, a play about the illusions shattered by the
dismantling of the Berlin Wall.
The two pieces have a good deal in common: for example, a performance better
than the script deserves and the absence of targets worth hitting. As in
politics, the left may have run out of ideas. One senses that a theatrical
era is coming to an end, though the professionalism of the acting and the
direction remains.
Brenton is far too good a playwright not to have sensed that himself. The
Bertie in his title is, in part, Bertolt Brecht. This is a play as much
about theatrical approaches as about politics. Brecht stood for certainties,
even if eventually it required a wall to shore them up. The question is what
happens when people on the repressed side of the wall see the licence on the
other side.
Brenton lays it on thick. Here is south London, Easter 1990. Decadence is
all over the place: uncleared-away Chinese take-aways, piles of capitalist
newspapers, Coca Cola cans, Pepsis as well, mattresses on the floor, a dirty
television set. The most frequent word used by the most talkative of the
early characters begins with an 'f'. The same character wears a T-shirt
advertising Virgin Airlines.
When the principal female finally wakes up, she talks about the joys of
having breakfast travelling first class on Cathay Pacific and having sex in
the aircraft's loo. Then she drinks lager from the can. She is, of course, a
social worker, for whom life has gone wrong; she is also on drugs.
The girl on the other mattress is a 17-year-old suffering from venereal
disease, but unwilling to go to the doctor for treatment and preferring to
practise the skills of the commedia dell'arte. She spends quite a lot of
time standing on her head and wants to move south to the Avignon festival.
Outside is a backdrop of some of the ugliest buildings in East Berlin. From
there the sister of the social worker arrives, as does her lover, an
ex-Stasi official, sometimes posing as Brecht and wanting to make a new life
in the Netherlands. He asks questions like: 'Are these conditions
representative of a British working class house?'
One could go on. The play is not quite as awful as a description of the plot
makes it sound. Brenton can write, sometimes like Noel Coward, as in the
line: 'Strange how continental men have overdeveloped legs'. The acting is
very good, notably Penny Downie as the social worker and Diana Rigg as her
sister, Rosa. Some of the political observation is sharp. Rosa did her
thesis in East Germany on compulsive swearing, and notes there is a lot of
it about in South London.
Berlin Bertie is directed by Danny Boyle. Brenton has a prolific output and
must be going through a period of adjustment. One looks forward to where he
goes next.
Royal Court Theatre. Part of a season supported by Wilde Sapte, Solicitors.

FT  16 APR 92 / Arts: Photographic Exhibitions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LYNN MACRITCHIE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Photographic images are a staple of our culture with a vital role in our
visual arts, where they have been the rival, partner and tool of the painted
or graphic image since photography became generally accessible as a medium
in the mid-nineteenth century. The manner of presentation of photographic
images has been much debated, and forms an important current in the complex
aesthetic climate.
In 'Outer Space', at the Camden Arts Centre until April 26, eight artists
from different countries use photography in conjunction with installation
and video to explore a wide array of subjects, from the world outside the
gallery window - the cars photoscreened on the walls by Ulrich Gorlich seem
to have driven straight in from the Finchley Road - to the imaginary history
sparked off by the accidental discovery of a menu holder.
Cultural identity forms a common theme in the works shown by Willie Doherty,
Krystyna Ziach and Susan Trangmar, whose slide projection installation
simply but very effectively illustrates the complexity of symbols, from
embroidered Indian silks to Ninja Turtle badges, sported by the young pupils
of Virginia Primary School, east London.
One of the most successful pieces is Hotel Polen by Ania Bien, a Polish
artist who lives and works in Amsterdam. A series of large black-and-white
photographs, imposingly framed in black, lines the walls of a corridor-like
space. The photographs are of photographs, old photographs from the time of
the second world war displayed in a menu holder inscribed with the name of
the hotel.
As we walk and look from image to image, we become absorbed in the narrative
they seem to suggest. The people, places and objects shown were once real
enough. The connections we begin to fancy between them we construct for
ourselves, an excellent demonstration of the imaginative power that such a
careful conjuncture of image and presentation can achieve.
The notion of the photograph as bearer of secrets, recorder of hidden
worlds, is at the heart of the work of Sophie Calle, an example of which can
be seen in 'Doubletake', about to finish at the Hayward Gallery (until April
20).
She exhibits four works based on photos taken by the security camera of a
cash machine. Three of them show male heads, expressions differing a little
 -relaxed and whistling, clutching the forehead, distracted and maybe sad -
as they perform this everyday task. The fourth set of photos is very
different.
First we see a woman, concentrating as she looks down at the machine. In the
second frame, a man appears. In the third, the same man crouches in the
middle distance, intent on something on the pavement. The fourth picture
shows the man again, much closer to the camera, his torso naked.
Of those who chose to comment on this work, none noted that this sequence
showed not a cash transaction but a rape. An everyday urban event, perhaps,
but hardly, surely, unworthy of comment. Calle's grim and clever piece makes
plain that the notion of 'security' which devices such as hidden cameras are
supposed to represent has very little to do with what really constitutes
preservation of the self. The mechanical watcher with the indifferent eye
might provide useful evidence of a robbery but its programme did not include
summoning help in the case of an attack.
Also at the Hayward, Andreas Gursky shows very large colour photographs of
unremarkable scenes - the interior of a factory, the floor of the New York
Stock Exchange, the view over a bleak motorway landscape. He is not the only
artist choosing to present such images: Alex Webb, Reinhard Mucha, Thomas
Ruff, Jeff Wall and the partnership of Peter Fischli and David Weiss
(represented in 'Doubletake' by an installation) and others have all shown
similar photographs, capturing similar scenes with equally apparent
artlessness.
Only the grand scale of their printing, the exquisiteness of their finish,
gives the game away. This is the sort of work that prompts puzzlement and
irritation, bringing forth remarks such as: 'I could do that'.
Why? Because, by presenting in the privileged space reserved for the viewing
of art, images the content of which is so obviously ordinary, the artists
strip away the received and cherished notion that art must present itself
through certain forms or materials in order to be recognised as art, as
something which has been given the right to comment on our lives.
Gursky, like his colleagues, will have none of this. Instead, he chooses as
his subjects scenes of the everyday, the impersonal workplace, the tedious
journey, the drab bleakness of which we normally thole without comment.
It is a shock to be confronted with these familiar but unacknowledged
environments when we are least expecting them, when we had hoped, perhaps,
to have made our escape. Our lives, these works remind us, are lived in such
bland interior, traverse these weary spaces. We are the architects of our
own banality, and it is our everyday refusal to acknowledge this
responsibility which makes these pictures seem so odd, so surreal.

There are all sorts of weird and wonderful things on offer, this being the
start of a holiday weekend. Do you fancy watching Johnny Weissmuller in the
17th and last of his Tarzan films? Make sure you are tuned to BBC2 by 8.05
in the morning and you can see him and Brenda Joyce in Tarzan And The
Mermaids. At 1.10 on ITV you have yet another chance to catch the cuddly
little 'ewoks' and special effects in Return Of The Jedi.
Most promising movie offer is the first terrestrial TV screening of
Tavernier's 1990 work, These Foolish Things, starring Dirk Bogarde and Jane
Birkin (10.00 BBC2). The more interesting music programmes include an hour
of Couperin in Music For A Dying King (7.02 C4) the king being Louis XIV;
and Rossini's Stabat Mater (7.25 BBC2) with the BBC Welsh Symphony Orchestra
and Chorus.
As the years pass Jana Bokova's documentaries get longer and longer. Today
BBC2 shows the first of her three-part Arena on 'the musical heritage of
Argentina'. Her programmes are by turns intense, lyrical, irritating, and
funny, but rarely boring and always idiosyncratic.

FT  16 APR 92 / Business Law: Agents; the regulation revolution
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN SIDKIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Few EC directives aimed at harmonising national laws for the single market
are likely to have as profound an effect as the self-employed commercial
agents directive.
The draft Commercial Agents Regulations are the UK Department of Trade and
Industry's attempt to implement the directive. But the DTI recognises the
upheaval that the Regulations will mean for many UK businesses. The
Regulations are therefore unlikely to come into effect before the January 1
1994 deadline set by the European Council.
Nevertheless, as this date is little more than two years away, and the
changes will apply to all commercial agency agreements in force at that
time, UK businesses which act as agents or use them need to plan for how the
Regulations will affect their operations.
Last autumn, for example, Glaxo concluded six agency distribution agreements
with five wholesalers. Instead of buying and selling at a profit, an agency
fee will be paid to these wholesalers. How long will these arrangements
last?
One clothing manufacturer,
Mariett, is engaging agents under appointment letters only until the
Regulations are formalised.
Similar actions are expected in other industries, in particular in certain
parts of food manufacturing and jewellery.
The Regulations impose duties on principal and agent which are either
broadly similar to the common law position or make good sense. For example,
requiring the principal to provide his agent with the necessary
documentation and information for the performance of the contract.
Such duties should not create too many difficulties for principals except in
industries where documents are scarce. But the Regulations go further. A
principal will have to notify his agent as soon as he expects that business
volume will be significantly lower than the agent could normally have
expected.
Separately, a manufacturer will also be required to inform his agent of his
acceptance, refusal or non-execution of business arranged by the agent. The
agent will therefore have to be informed of any omissions by the principal
in completing a transaction.
All provisions on the rights/duties of principal and agent will be mandatory
 -it will not be possible to contract out.
There will also be express provisions on the agent's remuneration where the
contract is silent on this subject.
Transactions on which commission is payable to an agent will fall into two
categories: those concluded during the period of the agency; and those
concluded after the agency has been terminated. This is a new concept in
English law.
Commission will be payable to the agent provided:
the transaction is mainly attributable to the agent's efforts during the
period covered by the contract and was entered into within a reasonable time
after the termination of the contract. No cut-off point is specified for
transactions entered into after termination of the contract. Express
contractual provision will therefore need to be made in respect of
commission payments after termination if the possibility of dispute as to
reasonableness is to be avoided;
the order for the goods reached the principal or the agent before the
contract was terminated and the agent would have been entitled to commission
had the contract not been terminated.
The Regulations also state when the commission will become payable. These
provisions increase the burden on a principal of paying his agent. He will
no longer be able to delay payment merely because he has not himself been
paid by the customer. On the contrary, when a commission falls due, a
principal will have to pay his agent not later than the last day of the
month after the end of the quarter in which it became due.
The agent will also be entitled to a statement showing how the commission
has been calculated and access to all the information necessary to check it.
To avoid disclosing embarrassing or confidential information, the principal
will need to maintain records solely for the purpose of enabling commission
to be calculated.
Commission will be lost if, through no fault of the principal, no contract
between the customer and the principal is completed. But, again, radically,
the Regulations will provide that if a principal is indemnified for
non-performance of the contract, (for example, under an insurance policy or
guarantee), his agent will not lose the right to commission.
Regardless of any contrary agreement, either party will be entitled to
receive from the other a signed written statement setting out the terms of
the agency contract, including terms subsequently agreed.
An agency entered into for an indefinite period will be capable of being
terminated by either party giving written notice to the other. But the
period of notice will not be less than one month during the first year of
the contract, two months during the second year and three months during the
third and subsequent years of the contract. Alternatively, the parties can
agree on a longer period of notice. However, it will not be possible for
that period to be shorter for the principal than for his agent.
The most controversial departure from existing English law will be the
agent's right to compensation on termination of the contract. Compensation
will be payable if the principal terminates the contract (except as a result
of the agent's breach). Compensation will also be payable if the agent
terminates the contract as a result of the principal's breach or because of
the agent's inability to perform the contract (for example, because of
illness), or because of frustration of the contract.
Compensation payable will cover losses, liabilities, costs and expenses
incurred as a result of termination of the contract. Compensation will take
into account the commission that would have been earned had the contract
been properly performed, and the principal derived substantial benefit from
the agent's acts.
Compensation will also take account of the agent's costs and expenses
incurred on the principal's instruction, which he has not been able to
amortise. Compensation will not to be payable if the agent transferred his
contractual rights or duties to another person.
A written claim for compensation will have to be given to the principal
within one year of the termination.
Restraint of trade limitation clauses in agency contracts will also be
introduced by the Regulations. Validity will necessitate their being in
writing, reasonable, limited to a two-year period, and relating to the
geographical area, customers and the kind of goods in respect of which the
agent has a right to act.
These provisions concerning contract termination have been a part of the law
of certain EC countries for some years. In significant ways the provisions
are comparable to those in respect of unfair dismissal remedies under
English law.
Amendments may be made to the draft Regulations before they come into force.
But amendments will not alter the fact that, for many agency contracts, the
regulation of agents will be turned upside down.

Thank goodness for Channel 4. At 7.50, after Channel 4 News (still pretty
impressive), they screen the first in a series of five short programmes
called Things That Don't Exist. The series ranges from law to finance but
today's subject is common-law marriages.
In Opinions (8.00) American economist DeAnne Julius, who has lived in
Britain for the past six years, considers the global consequences of the
collapse of the US military-industrial complex.
That is followed by the last in the comedy series The Big One (8.30) in
which American romantic writer Mike McShane has been rubbing along uneasily
with English slob Sandi Givskot. . . oh all right, Toksvig. At 10.00, True
Stories deals with Rytasha, daughter of a baroness, former international
model, and now a guru in Bangladesh and dispenser of charity.
BBC2's consistently impressive series Taking Liberties (8.00) investigates
the high level of trust placed by courts in miracles of modern science and
in expert evidence. In particular they look at the case of James Ryan who
was gaoled after 'facial mapping' evidence, then released two years later
when the evidence collapsed.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Bob Kralovetz, the newly-appointed regional managing partner for central and
eastern Europe for Arthur Andersen, the accountancy firm, is returning to
his roots as he takes up his new position in Prague.
With 300 staff in offices in Budapest, Moscow, St Petersburg, Warsaw and
Prague, and new ones soon to be opened, the firm decided it was time to
install a partner permanently in the region to co-ordinate its future
growth.
Kralovetz comes from Wisconsin, but his family emigrated to the US from
Czechoslovakia in the early 19th century. He says that while he considered
working from London or Vienna, the need to be close to the new offices, plus
the beauty of the city and his family connections steered him to Prague.
He estimates the number of professionals under his charge will grow by more
than 50 per cent a year during his initial five year term, and hopes that -
in spite of high development costs - the firm will be generating profits in
the region before he leaves.
He says the greatest demand for the firm's services currently comes from its
existing global clients which are examining investment opportunities in the
area. Andersen is also trying to provide assistance to large indigent
companies and small, local entrepreneurs.
A new office is likely to be opened in Kiev within three months, and
preparations are already in hand for Riga and re-opening operations in
Zagreb. Over the next year, Sofia and Bucharest are also on the agenda.

FT  16 APR 92 / People: de Carmoy turns his hand to rent-collecting
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Having tried his hand at running an American and British bank and Belgium's
biggest holding company, Herve de Carmoy, the globe-trotting French banker,
has moved into the property business. He has been appointed non-executive
deputy chairman of the privately-owned Gross Hill Properties, which is
believed to be Britain's biggest investor in freehold residential ground
rents.
Michael Gross, who set up the company in 1983 in partnership with Hill
Samuel Bank, says that the 55-year-old de Carmoy has been a close friend for
20 years. De Carmoy began his banking career with Chase Manhattan in the
early 1960s and rose to become its general manager for Western Europe. It
was during this period that Gross came to know de Carmoy through business
deals he did with Chase.
This latest appointment comes a fortnight after Gross bought out Hill
Samuel's stake in his company. De Carmoy has also been appointed
non-executive deputy chairman of Sydney &amp; London Properties, a joint venture
between FAI Insurance Group of Australia and Gross Hill, established in
1987. It invests in commercial properties and has gross assets of around
Pounds 100m.
The arrival of de Carmoy on the board of Gross Hill and its associate should
enhance the credibility of this little known property operation at a time
when the property industry is going through a particularly difficult period.
Having made his mark first at Chase Manhattan and then at Midland Bank,
where he was head of international banking, de Carmoy went on to become
chief executive of Societe Generale de Belgique in 1988. However, since he
stepped down from this last post he has kept a low profile, although he does
sit on the business advisory board of the European Bank for Reconstruction
and Development headed by fellow Frenchman Jacques Attali.

Jimmy James, a veteran of the Duke of Westminster's Grosvenor Estate, and a
director of the Royal Bank of Scotland, is to take over the management of
the Duchy of Cornwall for the Prince of Wales from July next year. He
succeeds David Landale, who retires then.
Officially entitled 'Secretary and Keeper of the Records of the Duchy',
James will be familiar with the Prince of Wales's philosophy in forming
policy for the management of the land, residential and commercial property
because he has been on the Prince's Council, the Duchy's governing body,
since 1984.
Whatever he may think about such challenges as Poundbury, the model country
town Britain's future king wants to build in one corner of his land, James
comes to the Duchy at 57 as a hard-nosed real estate manager who is credited
with helping to bring Grosvenor into the modern world. A chartered surveyor
by training, he joined the Grosvenor Estate in 1961, and, since 1971, has
been executive trustee for the Estate's interests in Britain and overseas.

FT  16 APR 92 / Technology: The smart trolley goes shopping
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VALERIE WHITE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
First there was the smart house, then the smart car. Now comes the smart
trolley. It's called the videocart and it could change the way we shop.
The computerised trolley features a small liquid crystal display screen
attached to the handle. As the shopper moves round the store, infra-red
sensors located in the ceiling trigger radio signals which activate the
display, passing information to the consumer.
The first information to flash on to the screen is a floorplan of the store.
This is replaced by information specific to each aisle, such as special
offers. By pressing a button on the LCD the discount will automatically be
sent to the checkout. It can also offer nutrition tips and even suggest
possible menus.
For shoppers in a hurry, or those who are not familiar with the store, there
is an item locator which works by a simple push-button system. Narrow down
the choice until the required item is listed, and the screen will indicate
which aisle to head for. This can be done generically or by brand name.
In addition to store information, the LCD shows 10-second commercials.
Research indicates that 80 per cent of brand choices are made at the point
of purchase. The trolley's manufacturers see this form of advertising as a
rival to TV.
The trolley is the brainchild of Videocart Inc, a Chicago-based company
which developed it with IBM. Ten supermarket chains throughout the US,
including many Kroger stores, are using the trolleys. The company predicts
that 2,000 stores will be stocking videocarts by the end of 1993.
'Retail demand for the videocart has been incredible,' says Bill Dupre,
Videocart's vice president of retail relations. 'Retailers like the way it
personalises shopping and delivers customer service benefits without
increasing labour costs.'

series jibe lives on. However, the message from recruiters planning for the
future is no laughing matter for the graduates of the 1990s.
More than a decade after John Cleese ridiculed the profession as
'irrepressibly boring and dull' - and moved on to make lucrative management
training videos - the tarnished image lingers.
An advert in a recently-published student careers guide from BDO Binder
Hamlyn shows a fake brass plaque. On it is etched: 'Dull, Grey &amp; Ditchwater,
Chartered Accountants.' The caption reads: 'If you want to be a boring
accountant, go and work for someone else.'
Such defensiveness may seem surprising so long after the slur surfaced. It
should be doubly perplexing given the high level of recruits currently
circulating on the job market. It does, however, reflect something of the
changing nature of graduates that the accountancy firms are now seeking.
The supply of graduates seeking accountancy jobs has probably never been
higher. Price Waterhouse says that last year it had nearly 14,000
applicants. KPMG Peat Marwick estimates that in London alone there have been
about 4,000 applications for about 200 openings this year, while nationwide
it has nearly 10,000 students applying for some 700 places.
The demand from the firms has been dropping sharply. Ernst &amp; Young hired 650
graduates in 1989. This year the figure is likely to be about 500. At
Coopers &amp; Lybrand Deloitte, the number has fallen from about 1,000 in 1990
to 800 this year.
Mr Alan Fawcitt, a careers adviser at Cambridge University, estimates the
larger firms have cut back by an average of 25 per cent in 1991 and 1992.
'Accountancy is no longer a fall-back,' he says. 'The firms are being much
more selective. They have fewer vacancies, are finishing recruitment
earlier, and picking and choosing quality candidates.'
That has been good news for the firms, which have been able to attract
better applicants than in previous years - although they concede that the
best remain highly employable and are still difficult to entice.
Mr Dick Shervington, national recruitment partner at Price Waterhouse, says:
'We have been a great deal more selective this year. We had a lot of
applications in the autumn, some from people who have not entirely thought
through their choice.' The firm has set deliberately high standards. 'We've
been pretty harsh. We have not asked people to walk on water but at least to
take a few steps across the Thames.'
Even so, he has been surprised by the nervousness of recruits eager to seize
guarantees. Price Waterhouse normally assumes a 50 per cent acceptance rate
from those offered jobs, and was planning on a two-thirds rate last year
given the economic conditions. In fact, nearly 70 per cent accepted
nationwide.
Mr Fawcitt agrees that competition between graduates for accountancy jobs
has increased. 'Quite a number of students have had a shock when they have
found they have been turned down,' he says. 'That has not really happened
before in living graduate recruitment memory.'
The decline in numbers being recruited reflects the the recession. On one
hand, the slowdown of the economy has reduced demand for accountancy firms'
services, reducing the expansion curve of the past decade. On the other,
newly-qualified staff - and others at all levels within the firms - have
refused to move to other employment as part of the normal process of
wastage.
This has been driven by a contraction in the availability of other financial
service sector jobs, and because employees are less willing to take a risk
on an outside job when they know that there is less chance of being
re-employed by their firm.
It has resulted in widespread redundancies, and a scaling back in the
quantity of graduates being taken on in the first place.
The drop in numbers recruited also represents a resumption of a more
sustainable level of recruitment, down from an abnormal peak caused by the
mergers between large firms in the late 1980s. The firms have slimmed down
from an initial period of over-staffing, while the number of students
seeking accountancy employment has remained relatively stable.
That leaves a more worrying underlying trend. There seems to be little
prospect of renewed job growth, even when the economy picks up. Most firms
stress that their current recruitment plans stretch well beyond the
recession. 'You have got to look ahead three to five years,' says Ms Chris
Lynch, national recruitment manager at Ernst &amp; Young. 'We are recruiting for
the future.'
Mr Ian du Pre, national recruitment partner at Coopers &amp; Lybrand Deloitte,
expects numbers to fall further in the future. He says clients are taking a
firmer hold upon the work offered by the firms. They are increasingly vocal
about high fees, and expect more focused work from more highly-qualified,
experienced staff.
Growing use of technology and more strategic approaches to audit work are
reducing the need for armies of junior staff. The traditional pyramid
employment structure of the firms - with far more trainees at the bottom
than partners at the top - is likely to squash itself more into a rectangle.
'Gone are the Herculean days when we recruited one thousand graduates a
year,' says Mr David Clifford, national student recruitment partner at KPMG
Peat Marwick. 'Everyone recognises that the explosive growth of the 1980s
can't happen again. There is a degree of caution now.'
What remains is becoming more fragmented. The last few years have seen a
sharp growth in trainees recruited straight to the tax department. At
Coopers, about 10 per cent of graduate recruits study for qualifications
other than chartered accountancy, including exams in management accounting,
public finance and actuarial science.
One of the more radical schemes has been developed at Grant Thornton, which
launched a business adviser trainee scheme for 60 graduates last summer.
Those accepted are being offered a fast-track route with the prospect of
becoming partners within seven years. Accounting trainees, by contrast, will
become back-up staff to this elite, and increasingly shift from graduates to
non-graduates.
Those involved in the job market would do well to pay attention to these
trends. If the current pattern of accountancy firm recruitment continues, it
will place severe demands on those drafting the syllabi of the different
professional qualifications to keep them relevant.
It raises the question of who else will employ the enormous number of
graduates previously hired by the firms - which only a few years ago
represented about 10 per cent of all students entering paid employment.
It also suggests that companies may have to start increasing their own
training budgets or finding new sources of skilled staff as the smaller
number of recruits offered qualifications through the firms remain loyal to
their original employer.

<TEXT>
THE ACCOUNTING Standards Board is restructuring the way it arbitrates
contentious accounting practices following complaints from companies that
the mechanism is undemocratic, it emerged yesterday.
The changes will affect the operation of the urgent issues task force, which
was established by the ASB last year to give swift rulings on the legitimacy
of accounting practices as soon as they emerged.
The task force will publicise the subjects it is considering more widely,
produce an interim discussion of a subject and then allow at least a month
for additional consultation before its binding 'abstract' on a topic is
released.
The move follows widespread disgruntlement from businesses that they have
been taken by surprise at the speed and impact of previous task force
pronouncements. These include a controversial guideline on the treatment of
goodwill on the disposal of an acquisition, which was considered by the task
force in October, issued in December and came into force in January.
Mr David Tweedie, chairman of the ASB, said: 'People have felt they haven't
quite understood what was happening. This gives them more chance to comment.
It's a bit more democratic.'
The calls for more openness and a longer period to consider proposals come
in spite of the fact that the 16-strong task force includes five
representatives from industry.
Two other task force abstracts have already been issued - on restructuring
costs and premium put options. Another three are under discussion - on
post-retirement benefits, long-term debtors in current assets and low-start
finance.
The task force has advertised in the financial press to try to boost its
circulation list.

FT  16 APR 92 / Beckett challenge may split Labour
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE THREAT of a return to a bitter schism within the Labour party emerged
last night after Mrs Margaret Beckett, the shadow chief secretary to the
Treasury, reversed her earlier refusal to contest the deputy leadership.
Her candidacy looks set to command strong support and has fuelled
controversy over the role of the trade unions.
Others candidates in the four-horse race who opened their campaigns
yesterday are Mr John Prescott, shadow transport secretary, and Ms Ann
Clwyd, shadow development minister. Mr Bryan Gould, shadow environment
secretary, so far the only challenger to Mr John Smith for the leadership,
is also contesting the deputy's post.
Mrs Beckett's decision to run - seen alongside the decision of Mr Tony Blair
and Mr Gordon Brown to step aside - has fuelled charges from opponents that
both contests are increasingly looking like a 'stitch-up'.
With Mr Smith the odds-on favourite for the leadership, backed by the
leaders of the biggest unions, challengers say a victory for the shadow
chancellor and the woman with whom he has worked closely for three years
will lead to bitterness and division within the party.
A member of the Gould team said: 'It is clear there have been
behind-the-scenes negotiations which are not healthy for party unity or
democracy. The joint candidacy (of Mr Smith and Mrs Beckett) would appear to
lack any vision for the future and represents only the 'one-more-heave' view
of what Labour should do after the election defeat.'
Such charges have thrown Mr Smith and Mrs Beckett's camps on the defensive
with both insisting that there was no such thing as a Smith-Beckett 'dream
ticket.' Mrs Beckett also made a point of insisting yesterday that while she
supported Mr Smith for the leadership she had neither sought nor received
his endorsement as deputy.
However, aides close to Mr Brown and Mr Blair, respectively the trade and
industry and employment spokesmen, and both supporters of Mr Smith,
confirmed they had agreed to allow Mrs Beckett a clear run.
The hard-left Campaign group will meet next week to discuss whether to put
up Mr Ken Livingstone, the MP for Brent East, as a candidate.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MRS MARGARET BECKETT, MP for Derby South, began by ruling herself out and
has now opted back in. In spite of protestations from the Smith camp that it
is not running a slate, she will be privately promoted as the shadow
chancellor's choice. English, a woman and a one-time leftwinger, her profile
meshes perfectly with that of Mr John Smith - though to be completely ideal
she should represent a southern English seat.
Mrs Beckett, 49, earned a reputation as a tough-minded Kinnockite loyalist
in her position as shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, where she policed
the spending instincts of her colleagues. But she originally comes from the
hard left and is remembered for a vitriolic attack on Mr Kinnock in 1981 for
his failure to back Mr Tony Benn, then running for the deputy leadership.
Her transition reflects an instinctive political nose which is also shown in
a confident Commons style and calm but combative technique in broadcast
studios.
*****
MR BRYAN GOULD, MP for Dagenham, is running for deputy leader, as well as
leader. His dual candidacy, described as a 'radical' platform, is justified
as offering the party a broader on-going debate than the so-called 'dream
ticket' of Mr John Smith and Mrs Margaret Beckett.
Furthermore, supporters of Mr Gould said yesterday that a victory in the
race for either post would ensure that any tendency to believe that
'one-last-heave' was all the party needed to win an election outright would
be countered by a deeper reappraisal of what went wrong last week.
His appeal is intended to keep the interests of voters in the south of
England prominently in the minds of Labour tacticians. He has also promised
his backers that he will accelerate the internal reforms of the party's
constitution.
To his opponents, Mr Gould's hesitancy about Europe and his advocacy of a
re-evaluation of sterling's position in the exchange rate mechanism could
re-open old wounds.
*****
MS ANN CLWYD, MP for Cynon Valley, has built a high profile in the party for
her globe-trotting in her capacity as the Opposition's voice on overseas
development. Her travels have included visiting Kurds fleeing Iraq's
President Saddam Hussein.
Ms Clwyd, 55, has been an MP since a by-election in her south Wales
constituency in 1984. She was a member of the European parliament for five
years previously. She is regarded as an internationalist and the keeper of
the party's Third World conscience. She is campaigning on a four-point
programme: electoral reform for Westminster, a higher profile for women's
issues, a firmly pro-Community stance on Europe and more stress on the
environment.
Many will rank her the least likely candidate to gather the 55 MPs' votes
needed to pass to the final stage of the contest. However, she has surprised
before, scoring 137 votes last year to come top of the women candidates for
the shadow cabinet.
*****
MR JOHN PRESCOTT, MP for Hull East, is a fast-talking leftwinger. Aged 53
and an MP for more than two decades, he is a former seaman who almost
deliberately cultivates the image of a lovable rogue. He is fiery tempered
in political combat but meeker in private.
He is far from an intellectual or ideologue but has long argued that
Labour's message to its traditional working-class supporters and others, has
been lost behind public-relations gloss. He had an often fractious
relationship with Mr Neil Kinnock - largely because of his decision to run
for deputy leader in 1988. As transport spokesman he overcame strictures on
public spending by devising funding schemes with private finances.
His pitch centres almost exclusively on the need to turn the
deputy-leadership into an organisational post, charged with reinvigorating
the party grassroots, raising membership, boosting the campaigning focus and
shifting party resources to Labour's regional centres.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE possibility of Mr Chris Patten, Conservative party chairman, becoming
governor of Hong Kong provoked a warm reaction from the colony's civil
service yesterday
Mr John Major, the prime minister, is believed to have told Mr Patten that
he could have the job if he decided to make a break from UK politics.
However, Downing Street officials said a final decision remained some weeks
off.
Mr Patten may decide he wants to return to the House of Commons at an early
opportunity, following the loss of his Bath constituency in the general
election last week.
Hong Kong civil servants indicated they would prefer Mr Patten to Dr David
Owen, the former Labour foreign secretary and leader of the defunct Social
Democratic Party, who has also been tipped as a possible candidate.
The vacancy follows the retirement later this year of Lord Wilson, the
present governor.
The colony's nascent political parties gave guarded support to Mr Patten's
candidature. The United Democrats, which scored a near clean sweep in last
September's direct elections, see him as a liberal who is likely to be more
supportive of their calls for greater democracy than the present
administration.
Hong Kong government officials said that a politician with Mr Patten's
political skills would be an asset to the colony as it approaches the most
difficult period of its transition from UK rule to Chinese rule.
Mr Patten is seen as a leading political figure - not a has been - with
close ties to both Mr Major and Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary.
He has also had administrative experience, a quality seen as vital in Hong
Kong, given the scale of the local civil service.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE IMPERIAL War Museum is to establish a new complex, with a maritime bias,
on a former dockland site at Hartlepool, Cleveland, it was announced
yesterday, Chris Tighe writes.
The development, the first part of which will open by 1995, the 50th
anniversary of the end of the Second World War, is the museum's first site
in northern England. It will cost at least Pounds 10m and attract up to
500,000 visitors a year.
Hartlepool was chosen partly because no national museum has a presence in
north-east England. Financial help and encouragement from the Teesside
Development Corporation was also a factor. So were Hartlepool's wartime
links. It was the first British town to be bombarded by German warships in
1914 and has strong maritime traditions.
The museum will cover the two world wars and the post-1945 world.

FT  16 APR 92 / North-west business shows optimism
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON-FAZEY, Northern Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CORPORATE sector of north-west England has remained basically intact in
the recession, which appears to have bottomed out in the region, according
to Mr Rodger Hughes, senior partner of Price Waterhouse.
Mr Hughes' conclusion follows a survey of 1,097 companies, sponsored by the
accountants, conducted by Manchester Business School (MBS).
The survey of companies with headquarters or main operations in the
north-west covered the six-month winter period just ended. Sales and profits
fell for 46 per cent of the companies, compared with 41 per cent last summer
and 25 per cent in the winter of 1990-91.
However, profits were falling faster than sales last year, but seem to have
stabilised. Of the 54 per cent reporting sales and profits growth, 19 per
cent achieved profits increases of more than 10 per cent over last summer, a
result of cost-cutting measures to combat the downturn. Signs of optimism
last summer were not fulfilled, but confidence is growing.
Only 20 per cent thought things would get worse, compared with 30 per cent
six months ago. Also, 25 per cent expected improvement within six months,
compared with 21 per cent last October and only 9 per cent a year ago.
Mr Nitin Sanghavi, director of MBS's Centre for Business Research, said:
'There is still need for some to get leaner and fitter, but a lot of
restructuring had taken place before the recession started. There will be
strong recovery among these companies.'
Mr Hughes said: 'If you stand back and compare with, say, 1973-74, things
are very different. Then, some businesses were cornerstones of the regional
economy and if one of them went there was enormous damage.
'There is a wider spread of industry now. There have been closures, but the
structure is intact.'
Both said most business had been holding back on investment while awaiting
the general election result.

FT  16 APR 92 / World Trade News: EC to hit back at US steel 'dumping' suits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BRUSSELS told the US yesterday it would respond vigorously to the American
steel industry's launch of anti-dumping and subsidy suits against five EC
steelmakers.
The real purpose of the suits was to 'obstruct legitimate trade in steel or
force partners of the US to accept the renewal of voluntary restraint
agreements,' the European Commission charged.
The EC executive urged Washington to examine each anti-dumping complaint
rigorously, adding it would 'not hesitate to use all methods of recourse
available under Gatt' to contest the suits.
This new skirmish in the widening transatlantic trade dispute, although
anticipated, does little to improve chances of the EC and US settling their
wider differences within the Uruguay Round negotiations, the main subject of
next Wednesday's bilateral summit in Washington.
The US industry's complaint has been made against United Engineering of the
UK, Usinor and Ascometal of France, Thyssen and Saarstahl of Germany, and an
unnamed Brazilian steel producer.
The complaint wants countervailing duties of 53 per cent, and anti-subsidy
duties of 10 per cent against the UK company; the respective figures claimed
against the French producers are 69 and 20 per cent, and against the German
companies, 79 and 25 per cent.
The action follows the failure two weeks ago of talks on a Multilateral
Steel Agreement (MSA) to replace voluntary restraints on entering the US
market, which expired at the end of March.
EC officials say that some European steelmakers, especially those on
long-term contracts, could as a result of weakness in the dollar be selling
into the US more cheaply than at home.
But they insist that this 'technical dumping' would make it hard to prove
injury to US producers, especially when the EC had cracked down on state aid
to steelmakers, and total Community exports to the US had fallen back from
7m tonnes to under 6m tonnes since 1989.
The MSA talks made some progress before being broken off at the end of last
month, and the Commission yesterday urged their resumption 'without undue
delay.'

A US Justice Department official said yesterday there was 'no likelihood'
his department would reconsider its April 3 decision to enforce US
anti-trust laws against foreign companies on the basis of harm to US
exports, AP-DJ reports from Tokyo.
But Mr James Rill, assistant attorney-general, dismissed concerns that the
change would be used as a trade policy weapon, noting rather that it was 'a
strong way of avoiding a trade war'.
Mr Rill was speaking after attending a bilateral conference in Tokyo this
week on US and Japanese anti-monopoly laws. During the conference, Japanese
officials repeatedly expressed their opposition to the change in US policy.
Mr Setsuo Umezawa, head of the Japan Fair Trade Commission, said enforcement
of the policy could violate principles of international jurisdiction, and
expressed fears it would be abused as a trade policy tool.
Mr Umezawa and other Japanese officials indicated that implementing the
policy could fuel friction in US-Japan relations. They wanted to work on
convergence of anti-trust procedures multilaterally through the Organisation
for Economic Co-operation and Development.

FOREIGN ship orders received by Japanese yards rose slightly in tonnage in

Japan Ship Exporters' Association (JSEA) said, Reuter reports from Tokyo.
'Orders fell in September-March, but we saw reasonably steady growth in
1991-92,' Mr Yuichi Watanabe, JSEA's executive managing director, declared.
'Forecast of 1992-93 orders is likely to be lower on the weaker world
economy.' Total orders were 140 ships of 7,234,840 gross registered tons
(grt) in 1991-92, against 148 of 7,141,199 grt in 1990-91.
'We still cannot clearly judge the world economy's trend, but expect it to
recover by autumn,' Mr Watanabe said. 'Shipowners are judging when to put in
tanker orders following the new tanker law.' The new International Maritime
Organisation law says that, from July 6, 1995, existing crude tankers of
20,000 deadweight tonnes (dwt) and above and existing product carriers of
30,000 dwt must undergo stricter inspections to prevent oil spills.

THE US will delay retaliatory duties on Canadian beer imports while trying

Canada had agreed to relax the curbs over three years, but the US rejected
this, saying it would take too long to implement. The US had threatened to
impose retaliatory duties on Canadian beer imports to the US starting on
April 10 if Canada did not act quickly to remove the barriers.
'The Canadian response has been disappointing to date, but we have decided
to delay for a short time, in the hope we can achieve a negotiated solution
that will provide significant non-discriminatory market access by this

Pending the outcome of talks, the US Customs Service would withhold
liquidating duties on Canadian beer entered or withdrawn for consumption
from warehouses. No extra cash deposits or bonds would be needed.

FT  16 APR 92 / World Trade News: Caribbean feels cold winds blow -
Recession is hitting a once-thriving industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CANUTE JAMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AS THE Caribbean high season draws to a close, the glum faces in the tourist
industry and indications of despair among hoteliers suggest all is far from
well.
Few countries in the region are attracting the numbers of visitors they
traditionally entertain: there has been no especially cold northern winter
to drive shivering thousands southward and the recession in North America
and western Europe continues. The depression in the industry must be shared
by more than a few finance ministers in the region, particularly those in
which the leisure and travel industry has become a pillar of otherwise
straitened economies.
Many people involved in the industry reckon that a host of domestic and
international problems probably means the industry's fortunes this year will
be hardly better than in 'awful' 1991 when 11.6m tourists earned the resort
countries about Dollars 9bn (Pounds 5.2bn). Acknowledging the gravity of the
situation, Caribbean political leaders recently gathered in Jamaica to see
how the product might be improved and earn more. They concluded there was
much hard work ahead.
Mr Jean Holder, director of the Caribbean Tourism Organisation, says the
industry faces the threat of stagnation after 10 years' healthy growth. It
was first hit by the decline in leisure travel because of the Gulf war, then
by the recession in western European and North America, from where the US
provides three out of five of the region's tourists.
Amid these problems, the recent collapse of Pan American Airways could not
have come at a worse time. The airline was long an important carrier of US
tourists and had become more important with the earlier demise of Eastern
Airlines. American Airlines is now the only major carrier.
Mr Luther Miller, one of the organisation's marketing specialists, says: 'We
need to put our heads together to find the best possible position for the
Caribbean to secure our tourist industry. God forbid that, for whatever
reason, American Airlines should go on strike. The effect would be
catastrophic.'
Most of the Caribbean resorts cater to the higher end of the market, and the
region is generally regarded as an expensive destination. Competing for
market share, especially during a recession, is difficult, and destinations
which offer a better bargain will be preferred.
'A few years ago, you were doing somersaults in the marketplace,' says Mr
Gordon Stewart, one of Jamaica's leading hoteliers. 'You are going to have
to do triple somersaults at this time to simply stay where you were a couple
years ago.' The image of the region has also suffered from an increasing
number of well-publicised attacks on tourists. It is a problem which resorts
can ill-afford to treat lightly, and one which Mr Miller thinks has to be
faced by the governments of the region.
'Very seldom a day goes by,' he says, 'when I don't hear a horror story on
one island or another about crime against tourists. It is all well and good
to suggest there is more serious crime taking place in the city centres
where our tourists come from, but when someone comes here for a vacation,
they do not want to be interrupted by ugly experiences.'
Meanwhile, while the industry is still hoping for an improvement by way of
an upturn in the US economy, the traditional resorts are looking anxiously
at a renewed source of competition: the Cuban government has decided that
the almost instant cash which tourism provides, can offer it some relief
from its hard-currency shortage.
Cuba is expanding its tourism infrastructure and intends to increase its
hotel rooms, currently at 7,000, to 30,000 by 1995. Tourist arrivals last
year were 400,000, and the government in expecting half a million this year,
with over 1m a year from 1995 onwards, most from an increased market share
in Canada, Mexico and west Europe. Cuba could be expected to exploit its
control of all aspects of the industry, setting prices to undercut other
Caribbean resorts.

INDONESIA cleared the way yesterday for a Dollars 1.6bn (Pounds 930m)
petrochemical project, six months after the government announced its
postponement until after 1995. Go-ahead depends on the plant being 100 per
cent foreign-owned, the first time a wholly foreign-owned project has been
allowed outside the Batam Island export zone. Officials are studying new
rules to permit full foreign ownership of the project, to be in West Java.
The government's treatment of the project, an olefins complex to make
petrochemicals for domestic plastic and textile industries, as a special
case has attracted criticism. Proposed by Mr Prajogo Pangestu and Mr Henry
Pribadi, two Indonesian businessmen, in early 1990, it won the backing of
the Bimantara Citra Group, an Indonesian conglomerate headed by Mr Bambang
Trihatmodjo, President Suharto's second son.
Originally estimated to cost Dollars 2.25bn, it was one of four
petrochemical projects totalling Dollars 9bn postponed last October. That
decision was prompted by concern over a deteriorating current-account
deficit due partly to the cost of servicing Indonesia's Dollars 75bn
international debt. Site clearance on the project had already begun, and
Bank Bumi Daya (BBD), a state-owned bank, had committed Dollars 500m to the
venture.
Mr Radius Prawiro, economy minister, said the BBD loan would be turned into
a short-term bridging loan and the project would have to be financed
entirely by foreign equity. This meant any offshore loans arranged by
foreign companies would not be counted as Indonesian debt.
Dr Adrianus Mooy, central bank governor, said the project's 'impact on the
balance of payments was still there, but less serious than before', because
of the Dollars 625m cost reduction. Japanese banks will be the main
financiers, with Toyo Engineering and Marubeni doing the construction.

<TEXT>
SINGAPORE Airlines (SIA) is to suspend its thrice-weekly transatlantic
service to Toronto after failing to resolve a dispute over traffic rights
with Canada's two main airlines.
The dispute revolves around passengers carried by SIA between Toronto and
Amsterdam, which is the airline's stopover point en route to Singapore.
Neither Air Canada nor Canadian Airlines International has flights to
Amsterdam, but they contend that SIA is carrying a large number of
passengers who transfer to flights to other European cities.
In a concession to the Canadian carriers, SIA last month halted services to
Vienna, which is also served directly by Air Canada.
SIA claims that it carries only 1.5 per cent of passengers between Europe
and Canada.
It contends that passengers flying to most other European capitals prefer to
take the direct flights offered by other airlines from Toronto.
According to SIA, Canadian officials earlier this week rejected a proposal
that the airline suspend its transatlantic flights in exchange for an
expanded service across the Pacific to Vancouver.
SIA currently has a twice-weekly service to Canada's west coast.
SIA said it plans to suspend the Toronto service in July, Mr Paul Tan, but
an SIA vice-president based in Toronto, said yesterday he expects further
talks to take place in the forthcoming months.
The dispute led Canada to give one year's notice last August that it was
terminating a bilateral air services agreement with Singapore.
Mr Cheong Choong Kong, SIA managing director, said yesterday that 'we tried
our best to carry on, but with August 1992 fast approaching, we had to make
a decision.
'The uncertainty is unacceptable.'

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
VIETNAM'S national assembly yesterday approved a new constitution which
enshrines the market-oriented economic reforms undertaken since the late
1980s.
In the best communist tradition, the vote was reported by the state media to
have been unanimous, although hardline deputies wary of capitalism fought a
stiff rearguard action over the last three weeks and delayed the final vote
for several days.
The new constitution drops the dogmatic left-wing language of the 1980
version it replaces and explicitly recognises the right of citizens to
engage in private business. The exact wording of the text was not known last
night, but the latest public drafts contain guarantees against
nationalisation and grant the Vietnamese the constitutional right to travel
freely; for the time being, however, they still need exit visas to leave the
country.
The national assembly gains increased powers but the Communist Party retains
responsibility for guiding the state and 'leading the workers. . . according
to Marxism-Leninism and the thought of Ho Chi Minh (the late Vietnamese
communist leader).'
Even the party is expected to act in accordance with the law and the
constitution. 'Sometimes the party interferes, sometimes there's a phone
call from up above,' said Mrs Ngo Ba Tanh, the reformist who chairs the law
commission of the national assembly.
Outright private ownership of property is still not recognised but farmers
have the right to transfer their land to their heirs. Vietnam has attracted
intense interest from foreign investors in the past three years but a US
economic embargo remains an obstacle to more rapid growth.

FT  16 APR 92 / Zimbabwe economy under siege: Independence celebrations will
be low-key
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY HAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ZIMBABWEANS will mark the 12th anniversary of independence on Saturday
against a background of food shortages, rapid inflation and increasingly
serious economic crisis.
The official celebration will be a low-key affair with the government having
wisely decided to limit ostentatious public spending at a time of mounting
food shortages caused by the worst drought in living memory.
Try though it may to blame events outside its control for the visible
deterioration in the country, President Robert Mugabe's government has
become the target of unprecedented public criticism.
Even the normally obsequious state-controlled media has sharpened its tone
and industry minister Kumbirai Kangai was given a rough ride by questioners
on a recent TV programme wanting to know why the government had not
anticipated the food crisis.
Agriculture minister Witness Mangwende was a target of bitter criticism in
parliament from his own backbenchers, deriding his earlier statement that
maize imports would not be required.
Current estimates suggest that with the near total failure of the maize crop
Zimbabwe will have to import at least 1.7m tonnes of maize along with
300,000 tonnes of sugar and wheat.
Mr Mugabe was forced to send his transport minister, Mr Denis Norman, to
Cape Town earlier this month to speed South African deliveries of food
imports.
The first maize trains left the port of Durban this week and while Spoornet,
the South African railways, is confident of getting the food to the border
at Beit Bridge, there are question marks over the capacity of the
Zimbabwean, Zambian, Malawian and Mozambican transport systems to cope with
food distribution.
Even before the drought Mr Mugabe's ruling Zanu-PF party was in trouble. Its
popularity ebbed at the end of the 1980s as unemployment rose five-fold to
1.5m, and as the government was forced to backtrack on promises to resettle
162,000 families, provide free schooling and better housing.
At the end of 1990, Mr Mugabe officially abandoned his commitment to
socialism and with considerable misgivings agreed to a World Bank-designed
structural adjustment programme, funded by western donors to the tune of
Dollars 1.5bn (Pounds 852m).
Implementation has been fitful and unco-ordinated, inflation surged above 30
per cent in February with low income groups experiencing 37 per cent
inflation.
The familiar pain without gain syndrome is now compounded by drought. GDP is
forecast to fall five per cent this year while the current account payments
deficit will reach 20 per cent of GDP.
Even if good rains fall next summer, it will take at least until 1994 to
regain current living standards. By then, the president will be close to his
70th birthday and facing a general election in 1995.
So unpopular is Mr Mugabe's government today that few analysts believe it
can win a fourth victory at the polls.
Until a few months ago, its supporters believed that economic reform coupled
with the land acquisition bill which will provide up to five million
hectares of white-owned land for black resettlement schemes could tip the
scales in their favour in 1995.
But the drought has put paid to all that and it is now a question of whether
the government - under its present leadership - will last until the next
election or whether Mr Mugabe, like Mrs Thatcher and Mr Bob Hawke, will be
replaced.
However, the president can take comfort from the fact that there is no
viable political opposition nor an obvious and acceptable successor within
Zanu. But he has very little else to celebrate this weekend.

The US Agriculture Department has enough food to 'meet currently known US

FT  16 APR 92 / Rao brings Congress party into line
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   TIRUPATI
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE STRIKING fact to emerge from the landmark Congress party convention
being held in the Hindu pilgrim town of Tirupati is the dominance the prime
minister, Mr Narasimha Rao, has now established over his party.
Widely regarded as an aged, interim leader when he took over last June, this
plenary session of the Congress is demonstrating that he faces no internal
challenges to his authority.
'The net result (of this meeting) is that the prime minister will be
stronger,' said one minister yesterday. The government is thus expected to
move more rapidly in implementing controversial reforms to restructure the
state-owned banking system and towards providing industry with more leeway
in declaring redundancies.
Ministers and senior party officials claimed that one reason for the
apparent slowdown in the pace of reforms since the February budget was the
fear of provoking a grassroots backlash at the current Congress session.
These fears resulted in a catch-all economic resolution being put before the
All India Congress Committee (AICC) meeting that embraced all points of view
in the party from socialism and central planning to pro-market policies.
But party officials said yesterday that the resolution should be regarded as
a mandate for change. 'The significance of the resolution is its endorsement
of the new policies,' said Mr V N Gadgil, a party spokesman heading the
drafting committee on economic policy. 'The prime minister's position will
also be strengthened.'
The party has also endorsed the government's stand against signing the
Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty saying it was biased against countries that
did not have atomic weapons. The Congress party favoured a
'non-discriminatory nuclear non-proliferation treaty', but did not spell
that out.
The convention has given Mr Rao his first opportunity to face the massed
Congress ranks as prime minister. In choosing to hold the meeting in his own
southern state of Andhra Pradesh, Mr Rao's aim was to demonstrate that he
was boss and that the south now counts for more in Congress counsels.
As a leader, he fails to excite the crowds as the Gandhi family knew how to.
By the rowdy standards of Congress occasions this has been a low-key affair,
with delegates paying little attention to the debates. But with his quiet,
elder statesman style, Mr Rao impressively demonstrated his authority when
he intervened to quell minor disturbances in the hall yesterday.
He has restored the party's self confidence after the demoralisation that
followed both Rajiv Gandhi's assassination and the loss in the June election
of their traditional bastion of power in the Hindi-speaking north. Mr Rao is
seen to have steered the party through the pitfalls of recent months - from
the collapse of international confidence in India's economic management to
the threat of separatist movements on its borders.
His hesitant, scholarly approach does not arouse enthusiasm within the
party. But as one delegate put it yesterday: 'He is mildly liked by all and
few criticise him.'
The issue that has most agitated delegates is the holding of elections for
the 21-man committee that runs the party. As the new party president, Mr Rao
wants to allow competition for places for the first in 20 years. The
elections mark the difference of style with Rajiv Gandhi and his mother
Indira, who themselves appointed the committee.

CHINA and South Korea are moving closer to establishing diplomatic relations
after a visit to Beijing this week of Mr Lee Sang-ock, the South Korean
foreign minister.
Mr Lee is attending a United Nations gathering on economic development in
Asia, but the issue of normalisation between the two countries is expected
to be prominent in discussions with Qian Qichen, his Chinese counterpart.
Economic ties between the two countries have been rapidly expanding, with
South Korea's recent approval for the Bank of China to establish a branch in
Seoul a measure of the growth since the opening of trade offices in both
capitals.
The volume of trade between China and South Korea totalled Dollars 5.7bn
last year when each granted the other most-favoured-nation trade status.
Political differences have kept them apart. China has backed the North since
partition of the peninsular after the second world war and the US has been
patron to South Korea through the cold war decades.
North Korea is certain to be unhappy about the prospect of political ties
between its former 'closer than lips and teeth' ally, China, and its bitter
political and ideological enemy.
The South Korean foreign minister is attending the 48th session of the
Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP), which
opened in Beijing yesterday with a speech from Chinese Premier Li Peng.
The meeting is the first UN major forum to be hosted by China in four
decades.
Li Peng told the 700 delegates to ESCAP, originally called the Economic
Commission for Asia and the Far East when it was founded in Shanghai in
1947, that it had returned to its original home.

FT  16 APR 92 / Australia's big parties ponder voter backlash: Independent
win upsets main groupings - The recent by-election victory by a
protectionist independent candidate reflects growing concern over reduced
tariff protection and industrial deregulation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AUSTRALIA'S mainstream political parties are facing up to some uncomfortable
questions following the unexpected victory of an independent protectionist
candidate in a weekend by-election.
Mr Phil Cleary, a local sporting hero, took 34 per cent of first preference
votes in the inner-Melbourne seat of Wills to become only the second
independent MP in Australia's federal parliament.
Mr Cleary's victory was a severe embarrassment to the governing Labor Party,
which called the by-election following the resignation from parliament of Mr
Bob Hawke, the former prime minister.
It also dashed hopes of an electoral breakthrough by the conservative
Liberal/National Party coalition, which failed to take advantage of
Australia's worst recession since 1983.
Like many by-elections, the result was affected by local factors which make
it an unreliable guide to the outcome of the next general election, due by
mid-1993.
Both main political groupings chose inarticulate candidates who were unable
to overcome Mr Cleary's high profile as the successful coach of the local
Australian Rules football club.
However, Mr Cleary's victory reflected opposition to the government's
attempts to increase the efficiency of the economy by reducing tariff
protection and winding back industrial regulation.
Under a programme drafted by Mr Paul Keating, who replaced Mr Hawke as prime
minister in December, average effective tariffs for most industries will be
cut to 5 per cent by the year 2000, from more than 20 per cent in 1983.
The government has also tried to improve the efficiency of investment
allocation by deregulating the financial sector, floating the Australian
dollar and reforming the labour market.
The argument that high tariffs protect inefficient industries at the expense
of the efficient mining and rural sectors has become economic orthodoxy in
the federal leadership of all three main parties.
But it has never been accepted in Victoria, the heartland of Australian
manufacturing, where both the Labor state government and the Liberal
opposition remain wedded to protection.
As a result, Labor found it difficult to respond to Mr Cleary's claims that
tariff reductions have closed factories and put 11.6 per cent of Victorians
out of work, compared to a national average of 10.5 per cent.
The government was also reluctant to accept the alternative explanation that
high unemployment has been caused largely by 18 months of flat or negative
economic growth triggered by tight monetary policy. Some leading members of
the government, mostly left wingers from Victoria, see the by-election as a
warning to Labor not to risk moving too quickly away from the party's
protectionist roots.
Mr Gerry Hand, the immigration minister, was the most outspoken of several
who suggested the government should reconsider its economic reform programme
in the light of Mr Cleary's victory.
A slowdown in tariff reform is unlikely because it would embarrass Mr
Keating, the chief supporter of free trade, and lay the government open to
opposition charges of inconsistency.
However, the left is likely to use the by-election result to reopen an
earlier debate on whether the government should try to offset the impact of
tariff reform by supporting successful industries.
This approach, championed by Mr Simon Crean, the primary industries
minister, would offer limited government assistance to industries believed
to have a competitive future, such as food processing for export to Asia.
The idea has widespread support within the federal Labor Party, but is
opposed by the prime minister, who fears it would quickly degenerate into a
means of delivering disguised subsidies.
Mr Keating also indicated in a private speech to Labor MPs that he believes
the government can win the 1993 election without a potentially damaging
change of policy. His view is that the Wills by-election came too early to
allow Labor to benefit from signs of economic recovery over the last six
months, which he believes will be reinforced by a ADollars 2.3bn (Pounds
1bn) public spending stimulus announced last month.
National opinion polls show a steady drift to Labor since Mr Keating took
over from Mr Hawke. The government trailed the opposition coalition by only
5 percentage points in the latest opinion poll published on Tuesday compared
with 18 points in January.
Labor can also take comfort from the opposition's failure to win Wills,
which has stimulated a parallel debate over the coalition's commitment to a
comprehensive package of tariff cuts, tax reforms and labour market changes.
Mr John Hewson, the coalition leader, has faced calls for changes to the
package from state leaders in Victoria and Queensland, and criticism of his
leadership from Mr Malcolm Fraser, a former Liberal prime minister. Mr
Hewson, who became leader after the 1990 general election, has rejected Mr
Fraser's criticism and called a hasty meeting of federal and state leaders
to thrash out a fresh approach to selling the opposition package.
However, the coalition's failure in its first big test under his leadership
does not augur well for its hopes of ending a decade in the political
wilderness.

<TEXT>
WEST GERMANY'S inflation rate proved higher than first estimated last month.
Announcement yesterday of a 4.8 per cent annual rate came as public sector
workers considered whether to strike over a pay offer of exactly the same
size.
The new figure compares with the provisional 4.7 per cent earlier reported
for March by the federal statistics office based on returns from four
states.
The steady rise in German inflation above 4 per cent has prompted the
Bundesbank to lift official interest rates to record post-war levels, with
the central bank also concerned over the rapid increase in money supply.
Mr Otmar Issing, a Bundesbank director, said recently that although
inflation would fall well below 4 per cent by the year's end, it was
unfortunate in view of wage talks that it would remain above this level for
a while.
The public sector unions have called strike ballots after turning down a 4.8
per cent package.
Mr Issing said it was too early to tell when the higher interest rates would
brake money supply growth, indicating that they would not be cut for some
time.
'It's like a big tanker,' he said of the money supply expansion. 'If it's on
the wrong course, it takes time to correct this.'
West Germany's trade surplus totalled DM1.6bn (Pounds 560m) in February
against DM412m in January and DM2.1bn in February, 1991, the statistics
office said.
Figures for the whole of Germany, already reported, showed a February
surplus of DM2.2bn, up from DM45m in January.

FT  16 APR 92 / Russians prepare for formal claim to Crimea
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE TENSE relations between Russia and Ukraine, marked by the bitter dispute
over control of the former Soviet navy's Black Sea fleet, can be expected to
deteriorate today if the Russian parliament goes ahead with a vote to lay
formal claim to the Crimea, which is part of Ukraine.
The resolution to be considered by the Congress of People's Deputies seeks
to nullify the 1954 decision taken in 1954 to transfer the Crimea from
Russian to Ukrainian jurisdiction, claiming the move had no legal status
because it was never agreed by the Russian parliament and that the people of
Crimea were never consulted.
Russia's determination to keep control of the Black Sea fleet, now largely
obsolete, is seen by many as mainly governed by the territorial imperative
of getting back Crimea.
If voted through, the resolution would add a malign dimension to the
relations between the two states. Tension had eased slightly after an
agreement for high-level talks on the fate of the Black Sea fleet and
Ukraine's apparent reversal of its decision to retain tactical nuclear
weapons. The Crimean issue first flared up in February when it was brought
before parliament by Mr Vladimir Lukin, now Russia's ambassador to
Washington.
A key passage of the resolution says: 'The Russian parliament believes that
the restoration of historic justice is in the interests of all parties,
promotes peace and accord and hopes that the sovereign Ukraine will
demonstrate a similar approach.'

<TEXT>
MR CYRUS VANCE said yesterday that the UN would not extend its peacekeeping
operations to Bosnia-Hercegovina, where fresh clashes were reported despite
a ceasefire.
The United Nations special envoy, who arrived in Belgrade for another round
of peace talks, appealed to Bosnian leaders to respect the ceasefire.
'The situation in Bosnia-Hercegovina is very, very serious and is causing us
great concern. It is therefore essential that all the parties live up to the
ceasefire agreement. War is not the answer. It will be ruinous to all sides
and nobody should think that he or she can gain a one-sided advantage.'
Mr Vance said the UN did not have enough troops to undertake peace-keeping
operations in Bosnia as well as Croatia. Nor is there any UN mandate to
operate in Bosnia.
Despite the ceasefire agreed on Sunday by leaders of Bosnia's nearly 4.4m
Moslems, Serbs and Croats, clashes yesterday were reported in Sarajevo, the
capital of Bosnia, in Bosanski Brod, on Bosnia's northern frontier with
Croatia, and in Mostar, in the south.
The federal army said it had secured Visegrad, a predominantly Moslem town
in south-east Bosnia. The fighting has left dozens dead and forced 100,000
to flee.
David White, Defence Correspondent, adds: Britain's contribution to the
peacekeeping force in Yugoslavia will be a field ambulance unit and support
troops, 260 personnel in all, Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the UK defence secretary,
said yesterday.
The role of the lightly-armed troops will be to evacuate any wounded UN
personnel to hospitals.
The force is smaller than the 1,000-1,200 UK troops expected to be required.
Field Marshal Sir Richard Vincent, UK chief of defence staff, firmly
rejected any suggestion that Britain was 'dragging its feet' on UN
peacekeeping tasks.

</HEADLINE>

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE former Soviet republics in the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS)
may need Dollars 20bn aidthis year, in addition to the Dollars 24bn already
planned by industrialised nations for Russia, the International Monetary
Fund has warned.
Mr Michel Camdessus, IMF managing director, said in Washington yesterday he
had finished membership negotiations with 14 of the 15 republics - leaving
only Azerbaijan to complete the process - and hoped IMF members would
approve these arrangements by April 27, in time for the organisation's
spring meeting.
But he warned that the former Soviet Union would continue to require
substantial help for several years.
'The process of adjustment will be very difficult, very disruptive, but we
believe the burden of adjustment can be eased by financial assistance from
abroad,' he said.
The negotiation of membership quotas for all republics will play a
significant role in determining how much money they can borrow from the IMF,
once each has completed all its membership formalities and each has agreed
with the Fund a comprehensive economic adjustment programme.
Each country would normally be allowed to negotiate annual IMF drawings
equivalent to its quota, although Mr Camdessus said the size of the loan
arrangements was also tied to its needs and to the strength of its economic
programme.
The IMF chief said his organisation expected to invest Dollars 25bn to
Dollars 30bn in the former Soviet republics, including Russia, over the next
four years. The World Bank is expected to invest Dollars 12bn to Dollars
15bn over the same period, while the European Bank for Reconstruction and
Development will also make a significant contribution.
This would still, however, leave a significant shortfall to be made up by
bilateral assistance similar to the Dollars 24bn package agreed for Russia
by the Group of Seven leading industrial nations.

The Russian parliament yesterday adopted a declaration which allowed the
government to claim that it was free to pursue radical economic reforms
after a week of confrontation with deputies.
'This declaration gives the government the possibility of acting according
to reality, and gives us more time. The question of resignation is now off
the agenda,' said Mr Alexander Shokhin, the deputy prime minister.
Mr Peter Aven, chairman of the committee on foreign economic relations, said
the declaration allowed ministers complete discretion over the timing of
measures to soften the blow of the reforms.
He added: 'The reality is that the budget cannot afford these measures, and
so we cannot do them.'

MOLEX, the leading US electronic components company, reported solid results
in its third quarter, despite generally difficult times in the electronics
industry.
For the three months ended March 31, the company's net income was Dollars
16.6m, up 12.4 per cent over last year's Dollars 14.8m, on revenues of
Dollars 191.7m, an increase of 8.4 per cent over Dollars 176.8m last year.
Earnings per share for the third quarter were 33 cents, an increase of 3
cents from the same period last year.
For the first nine months, Molex's net income edged higher by 1 per cent to
Dollars 47.9m from Dollars 47.4m a year ago. Revenues for the first three
quarters were Dollars 568m, up 9 per cent from Dollars 521.2m last year.
Earnings per share for the first nine months were 96 cents, up just a penny
from 1991.
Mr John Krehbiel, chairman, said that the improving business in the US as
well as China and other countries in southern Asia outweighed declines
stemming from economic problems in Europe, Japan and Korea.

<TEXT>
MARRIOTT Corporation, the large but indebted hotels group, yesterday
reported static first-quarter profits of Dollars 11m after-tax (Dollars 10m
a year ago), and blamed the lack of progress on the continued over supply of
space in the domestic market.
Sales during the first quarter totalled Dollars 1.95bn (Dollars 1.83bn), and
Marriott claimed that  - once asset sales and some other non-comparable
factors were stripped out  - underlying operating profits improved by 11 per
cent.
It said occupancy rates for comparable units generally rose  - with the
full-service division showing a three percentage point increase, to the
mid-70s. However, average room rates were lower than a year ago in all four
lodging segments.
The company also announced that it had completed Dollars 200m-worth of asset
sales since the end of 1991  - part of programme to bring down debt  - and
has signed agreements for another Dollars 200m scheduled for completion by
the summer.
Polaroid, the photographic products company, reported a slip in
first-quarter sales, coupled with a sharper fall in earnings. After-tax
profits stood at Dollars 6.2m, compared with Dollars 16.4m in the same
period of 1991, while sales fell by 2 per cent to Dollars 431.3m.
Sales in the US were marginally higher, at Dollars 205.9m, but international
revenues fell to Dollars 225.4m. Polaroid, which had already warned of the
sales slippage, said that it was hit on the international side by the
stronger dollar, and weak economic climates in Europe and Japan.
Operating profits fell from Dollars 49.9m to Dollars 26.8m.

</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE long-delayed French debate over the Maastricht Treaty on European Union
seems finally to have been unleashed by President Mitterrand's weekend
declaration that he expected to be able to complete ratification soon,
probably by the summer.
The realisation that ratification and the accompanying reform of the French
constitution are now almost upon them, has suddenly goaded the critics of
the treaty into mounting their campaigns and mustering their forces.
The out-and-out nationalist opponents of Mr Mitterrand's vision of a
quasi-federal Europe appear too few to block the Maastricht treaty. However,
Mr Mitterrand could have more serious problems with moderate critics, who
are already manoeuvring to set conditions for ratification, which may seem
reasonable but could be incompatible with the treaty as signed.
The outright opponents include the Communists on the left, and small
nationalist fractions of the Socialist party, the centre-right UDF umbrella
grouping, and the right-wing Gaullist RPR party. Outside parliament, the
extreme right-wing National Front and the Greens may also be expected to
campaign against the treaty.
Mr Jean-Pierre Chevenement, former defence minister, will not vote for the
treaty, but his nationalist clan has shrunk to well under 10 per cent of the
Socialist party.
In the Gaullist party, Mr Philippe Seguin has launched the anti-Maastricht
campaign, with a book* co-authored with a group of like-minded politicians
and jurists. But after calling a meeting of Gaullists yesterday, he was
apparently able to draw only about a dozen.
The official line of the UDF is traditionally pro-European and
pro-federalist. Its leadership, headed by former President Valery Giscard
d'Estaing, has promised support in general terms. There are certainly two
ultra-nationalist UDF MPs, Mr Philippe de Villiers and Mr Alain de
Griotteray; but if there are more, they have not shown their colours.
Serious trouble is only likely to come from the Gaullists. So far Mr Jacques
Chirac, the party leader, has kept his head well down. The leadership is
manifestly determined not to oppose the treaty on principle; on the other
hand, it needs to satisfy the unreconstructed populists on the right as well
as the moderate modernisers in the centre. De l'Europe en General et de la
France en Particulier. Philippe Seguin and Marie-France Garaud, Le Pre Aux
Clercs, FFr110French inflation remained stable in March, and significantly
below the average of its main trading partners, according to provisional
figures released by the National Statistical Institute.

February and January. It takes the year-on-year rise to 3.2 per cent.

quarter results
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Wall Street
A STRING of mostly positive first quarter earnings announcements buoyed US
stock markets yesterday, lifting the index of blue-chip industrials to
record levels, writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 36.23 at 3,306.13,
below its highs for the day but still above the previous record close of
3,290.25 on March 3. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 also ended
sharply higher, up 6.31 at 412.39, while the Nasdaq composite index of
over-the-counter stocks jumped 6.66 to 594.81. Turnover was heavy at 232m
shares.
Although trading was busier than the previous day, the market was still
hindered by the disruption of futures trading created by Monday's flood in
Chicago, which put the Chicago Board of Trade, the country's main futures
exchange, out of business and curtailed liquidity in all financial markets.
The only economic news of the day was mixed. March retail sales fell 0.4 per
cent, but the broader figure showed an 11.9 per cent in real retail sales
during the first quarter.
The figures, however, were overshadowed by the first full day of the
quarterly reporting season and some solid corporate performances.
IBM climbed Dollars 1 to Dollars 88 3/8 after reporting first quarter income
Dollars 1.04 a share, above market expectations and better than the 97 cents
a share earned a year ago. IBM's figures boosted other big computer stocks,
with Hewlett-Packard adding Dollars 3 at Dollars 80, Digital Equipment
rising Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 46 7/8 , Compaq firming Dollars 1 to Dollars
26 1/4 and Motorola gaining Dollars 1 1/2 at Dollars 76.
Securities houses were notably firmer early on following release of record
first quarter results, but profit-taking and concern about future earnings
wiped out all the gains, with Merrill Lynch ending down Dollars  7/8 to
Dollars 50 1/8 , PaineWebber finishing unchanged at Dollars 20 3/4 and west
coast broker Charles Schwab closing up just Dollars  1/8 at Dollars 29 1/2 .
A rare decline was posted by LA Gear, which lost Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 12
5/8 after the sports shoe maker unveiled a 42 cents a share first quarter
loss and announced it had technically defaulted on a bank agreement.
American Home Products jumped Dollars 4 to Dollars 81 3/4 on news of a 15
per cent improvement in profits to Dollars 406.3m achieved on the back of
strong performances from the group's domestic pharmaceutical and consumer
health care businesses.
Ford rose Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 41 after it released details of a 9.1 per
cent increase in US-made car sales and a 14 per cent increase in truck sales
during the first ten days of April.
Canada
IN TORONTO falling interest rates helped boost share prices in active
trading. Based on preliminary data, the composite index rose 22.81 points,
or 0.67 per cent, to 3,412.64. Advancing issues outpaced declines 311 to
267. Volume was a solid 28.2m shares against 19.5m on Monday, and trading
value climbed to CDollars 318m from CDollars 178.4m.
The financial services sector gained 1.65 per cent, as National Bank rose
CDollars  3/8 to CDollars 9 1/4 , Scotiabank gained CDollars  3/8 to
CDollars 21 1/4 , Bank of Montreal was up CDollars  5/8 to CDollars 45, and
Royal Bank was up CDollars  1/2 to CDollars 24 1/8 .

FT  15 APR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: EC gives comfort to traditional
banana suppliers - Caribbean reactions to a decision to keep the fruit out
of the Gatt negotiations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CANUTE JAMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TRADITIONAL suppliers of bananas to the European Community, who fear a loss
of the trade when the single European market is created in eight months,
were comforted by last week's European Commission decision against the
inclusion of the fruit in the Gatt negotiations.
The commission's proposal to apply quotas to banana imports from other
sources, mainly the Latin American countries, rather than imposing tariffs
on these imports, is regarded by the traditional suppliers in the African,
Caribbean and Pacific group of countries as necessary for the survival of
their industries on which many small economies are dependent.
But the commission's position has apparently driven home to ACP producers,
which have higher production costs, the message that ultimate survival on
the European market means that they will have to increase productivity and
efficiency, and that it is not the wisest of courses to continue depending
heavily on bananas as a source of foreign earnings.
'We are pleased that they have decided not to use tariffication in dealing
with this very important matter,' said Mr Marshall Hall, chairman of
Jamaica's Banana Export Company. 'Tariffication would have exposed us to the
wealth of the multinational fruit companies, which can afford to lose some
money over several months in order to gain a market advantage.'
The ACP producers, who supply one fifth of the bananas consumed in the EC,
had been worried by the proposals made in the text of the current Gatt
negotiations that current trading conditions for current export volumes be
maintained for all sources until 1999. Anything above this would be subject
to tariffication, with tariffs being reduced progressively by an average of
36 per cent between 1993 and 1999.
Against this proposal, the EC had to set its own undertaking to the ACP
states that they would not be placed 'in a less favourable situation than in
the past or at present'. The commission, in arriving at a compromise,
proposed quotas on fruit from non-ACP sources. The quota can move upwards
depending on the growth of consumption in the EC, reducing prices to
consumers. But no figures have been set.
All this depends on the granting of a waiver by Gatt. Opposition is expected
from the Latin American producers and the US multinationals that operate in
those countries, and who, for a long time, have been casting envious glances
at the European market. Regardless of the outcome of impending negotiations,
Dame Eugenia Charles, prime minister of Dominica (one of the Windward
Islands) whose economy is 60 per cent dependent on banana exports, has drawn
some clear conclusions.
Caribbean bananas cost about 30 per cent more to produce than Latin American
fruit. There would be one clear and easy winner in open competition.
'We now have to ensure that we improve the quality of our bananas and that
we increase the level of productivity by raising yield per acre so the
farmer gets more,' she said. 'We also have to ensure that diversification
takes place because we must never again rely entirely on bananas. The
commission's decision gives us some time and some breathing space for us to
put the rest of our house in order. But it is not going to be easy.'
Latin American producers are hardly likely to be happy at the latest
developments. The Union of Banana Exporting Countries (UPEB), which is made
up of eight Latin American producers, has been seeking unrestricted EC
access for their cheaper fruit. A recent letter sent by UPEB members
(Colombia, Costa Rica, Honduras, Guatemala, Nicaragua, Venezuela, Dominican
Republic and Panama) to Mr Jacques Delors, the president of the European
Commission, questioned the need for continued protection for ACP fruit.
The Latin producers told Mr Delors that it was unacceptable and unusual to
exclude bananas and other tropical agricultural products from the
globalisation of markets being considered by the Gatt. UPEB said continuing
restrictions would halt the growth in the Latin countries' banana exports to
the EC.
ACP producers have launched a diplomatic offensive in Washington to counter
opposition from the US fruit industry to the EC position. Caribbean
officials, producers and traders say they expect a 'sympathetic' hearing,
while there is some optimism that the derogation under the Gatt will be
granted  - if the US does not ask too high a price of the EC in return.
'The question for the ACP producers now concerns the manner of the
administration of the quotas,' said Mr Hall. 'How will the quotas allow for
growth? For how long will they be in place? The next step is for ACP
producers to prepare their quota suggestions. I expect the European
Commission to receive a deluge of quota proposals.'

FT  15 APR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Mali hopes for return of golden
age - One of the great unexplored gold prospects
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR GUILD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GOLD MADE the ancient empire of Mali one of the richest in the world. And
now, six centuries later, West Africa is seen by mining companies as one of
the world's great unexplored gold prospects.
Carbon dating of pottery fragments found in ancient workings at Syama in the
far south of Mali, near the border with the Ivory Coast, indicate that oxide
ore was worked 740-400 years ago. BHP Minerals International, the first
major exploration and production company to establish a presence in the
region's gold fields, is negotiating with the Malian government before
making a final decision on an additional Dollars 70m investment in Syama.
Syama will yield 2.5 tonnes of gold this year and is expected to produce 3
tonnes for the next two years.
Then, the company, which up to now has been shifting dirt, will hit hard
rock. The new investment will extend the life of the main open cast mine, 1
km long and 330 metres across, by up to 20 years, while exploratory drills
at a further half a dozen satellite sites have indicated promising reserves.
Total reserves at Syama have been estimated at 80 tonnes.
The Australian-based multinational is investing a further Dollars 5.5m a
year on minerals exploration in West Africa as a whole, and in Mali, Ghana
and the Ivory Coast in particular.
BHP, among the world's largest minerals companies, has already invested
Dollars 40m in the pit in the three years since the signing of the
exploration agreement. The initial lease covered an area of 1,500 sq km, now
slightly reduced. The production agreement covers 20 sq km.
The average concentration of gold is currently 3.1 grams per tonne of ore.
But each day 13,000 tonnes of dirt is excavated from the main pit, of which
only 3,000 tonnes is processed through the mill.
'To justify our investment in management and infrastructure in West Africa,
BHP has to plan for a series of productive sites in the region,' says Mr
Daniel Johnson, mine manager at Syama. 'Syama is of huge significance for
Mali as its first, and so far only, large scale commercial venture into gold
mining using modern techniques. But for BHP it has to be seen in the context
of a turnover last year of Dollars 10bn.'
Syama by itself is also small in a regional context. For Mali, it represents
6 per cent of GDP. In Ghana, it would be considered a small to medium-sized
operation. Nevertheless, Mali is believed to have considerable, as yet
unexplored potential, similar to that of Ghana.
Mali has been bypassed by the major exploration companies, partly because of
the difficulties of detecting deposits, generally covered by thick layers of
laterite. Its poor infrastructure has been another factor  - for example,
industrial consumers pay 5 cents per kw hour for electricity in Ghana
compared with 25 cents in Mali. The gold has to be transported long
distances as Mali is landlocked  - BHP flys it first to Bamako, then to
Brussels, and finally to Geneva.
Mali's government ministries have been considered to be among the least
well-informed in the region. But things are changing. The United Nations
Development Programme recently completed an Dollars 8m, 12-year project to
give the country its own centre of expertise in minerals. UNDP's first
involvement in Mali's mineral sector dates back to 1979, when it located
early traces of mining. That provided the justification for heavier
involvement in exploration, and training of Malians. It was during this
phase that the Syama deposit was uncovered.
During the follow up, UNDP and the UN Department for Technical Co-operation
for Development, helped the Malian government negotiate and finalise the
agreement with BHP. The Malians struck what appears to be a favourable deal
at Syama, and it is one they are already starting to tighten up. In future,
the government is expected to take 6 per cent royalties, and a 20 per cent
stake. Taxation on profits will be levied at 45 per cent.
UNDP soon realised that the Malians themselves could take care of some
exploration at least. It financed teams to provide on-the-job training,
equipment for a geochemical laboratory and assistance with drilling. PDRM  -
the Programme pour le Developement de Resources Minerales  - has already
carried out contracts for analytical work, drilling, digging shafts and the
analysis of geological samples.
Minerals experts believe that Mali will now benefit considerably from an
aerial geophysical data set for the south and west of the country as a
back-up to surface mapping carried out by the Belgians, French and the UN,
much of it from the 1960s.
BHP is itself concerned to transfer as much expertise as possible to
Malians. For example, it already has ten West African exploration geologists
working in the region.
The company expects to start making a net return on its Syama investment by
the end of this next year.
Operating costs at Syama are thought to be in the range of Dollars 200 to
Dollars 250 a troy ounce, while the gold price has fallen from over Dollars
400 to Dollars 340 an ounce since Syama went into full scale production last
year. The feasibility study, on which the Syama investment was based,
assumed a price of Dollars 400 an ounce at 1988 exchange rates.
Elsewhere in Mali, the French Bureau de Recherches Geologiques et Minieres
has a concession on a deposit at Loulo, the west of the country. Here it is
negotiating a joint venture with the government and an as yet undisclosed
third party. These beds contain some 30 tonnes of gold to a depth of 100
metres, with between five and 10 grams of gold to every tonne of ore.
Mali will be hoping that it turns out to be more successful than its first
joint venture. The Kalana mine, which has gold reserves of 30 tonnes, and
the first large scale deposit to be exploited, was opened in 1984 and mined
with Soviet assistance. Officially, it was producing about 2 tonnes of gold
a year.
It has just closed, amid rumours that much of the production bypassed
official channels and was shared out by the country's now disgraced former
president, Moussa Traore, ousted in a coup in March last year, and the
Soviets. Most of what was left is said to have been exchanged by the
government for Soviet military hardware, much of it now useless with no-one
to service it or provide spare parts since the end of Soviet expansionism in
Africa.

FT  15 APR 92 / Government Bonds: Gilts shrug off production figures to
continue rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

UK GOVERNMENT bonds shrugged off industrial price and production figures
released yesterday which suggested that inflation and output may be
recovering more sharply than anticipated.
The benchmark 9.75 per cent gilt maturing 2002 opened at 104.00 and rose to
104 5/32 by the close for a yield of 9.11 per cent. At the close on Monday
the benchmark stood at 103 15/16 .
The June gilt futures contract on Liffe, the London futures exchange, closed
at 99.07, from 98.18 at the opening. Volume was 39,500 contracts.
Manufacturing output rose by 1.1 per cent during February, after recording a
0.6 per cent decline in January. Most analysts had anticipated a zero rate
of growth.
Factory gate prices rose 0.8 per cent in March, from 0.3 per cent during
February, for a year-on-year rate of 4.5 per cent  - the first rise in
factory gate prices since last October.
Market-makers were yesterday revising forecasts to take account of a slower
fall in underlying inflation. For example, Warburg Securities is now
forecasting 'core' UK inflation of 4 per cent by the end of this year,
compared with a previous forecast of 3.7 per cent.
However, the data had little negative impact on gilts. The market was
supported by positive sentiment following the Conservative election victory,
and an improvement in the German government bond market during the
afternoon.
GERMAN government bonds recovered from a gloomy start to close slightly
higher on the day, following news that an immediate political crisis in
Russia had been averted.
During early trading, sentiment was depressed by the prospect of domestic
strike action by 2.3m public sector workers. Late on Monday, the public
sector union walked out of pay negotiations with employers and will now
ballot members on industrial action. The union has claimed an average 9 per
cent pay increase, with the employers only willing to offer 4.8 per cent.
The benchmark 8 per cent Unity bond maturing 2002 fell to 100.54 in the
morning session, from 100.60 at the close on Monday. However, sentiment
improved later as news filtered through that the government of Boris Yeltsin
had won additional powers to pursue economic reform.
The benchmark bond closed higher on the day at 100.66, for a yield of 7.89
per cent. The bund futures contract on Liffe opened at 88.06 but slipped to
87.89 during early trading. It recovered through the afternoon to close at
88.08.
Money market conditions remain tight, suggesting little room for an easing
of monetary conditions. Despite an injection of funds yesterday under
section 17 of the Bundesbank Act, which allows the central bank to transfer
to the banking system cash held on deposit for public sector institutions,
short money rates rose slightly.
Overnight call money traded just below the 9.75 per cent Lombard Rate, the
Bundesbank's emergency funding rate for financial institutions.
US Treasury prices fell slightly, despite retail sales data which provided
evidence of continued sluggishness in economic activity.
In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was down  1/8 at 101
15/32 , yielding 7.865 per cent. The two-year note was also lower, down
1/16 at 101 1/8 , yielding 5.121 per cent.
For the second consecutive day, trading was subdued by the closure due to
flooding of the Chicago Board of Trade, which trades the main Treasury bond
futures contracts. This helped explain the lack of reaction to the news that
March retail sales fell 0.4 per cent, a figure that might normally boost
bond prices. The decline in sales, however, had been expected and already
discounted in prices.
In the credit markets, the Federal Reserve completed a round of two-day
system repurchases, with Fed funds trading at 3 per cent. Although the repos
were not anticipated, analysts said the intervention did not suggest that
the Fed was easing monetary policy again. Last week the Fed signalled it
wanted the Fed funds rate at 3 3/4 per cent.
JAPANESE government bonds were supported by the authorities overnight in
Tokyo but failed to sustain a rally, with sentiment dominated by concern
over the wider health of the financial system.
The benchmark 10-year government bond issue No 129 closed on a yield of 5.46
per cent, slightly better than 5.495 per cent on Monday.
The Ministry of Finance supported the market for the fourth time since the
end of last week, offering to buy up to Y50bn of government issues Nos 129,
126 and 119. It is not known how many bonds were bought in under the offer.
However, against the background of a weak stock market, both cash and bond
futures slipped. The June 10-year bond future fell to 101.53, from 101.61 on
Monday, as the Nikkei stock market index fell below 17,000. The futures
contract later recovered ground to finish at 101.64.
Traders expected the market to remain within tight ranges until the outlook
for interest rates and the financial system is clearer.
Yesterday, inflation data for March showed domestic wholesale price
inflation running at a negative rate of 0.8 per cent year on year, from a
negative 0.6 per cent in February.

FT  15 APR 92 / International Company News: L'Oreal announces 19.7 per cent
increase
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
L'OREAL yesterday announced a 19.7 per cent increase in net profits to
FFr2.02bn (Dollars 363m) in 1991, from FFr1.69bn in 1990.
The result was achieved despite 'a rather gloomy economic climate' which was
'undeniably affected by the Gulf war' and a 'significant slowdown in
consumer spending in some major countries", the company said.
L'Oreal, which operates worldwide with a number of well-known cosmetics and
haircare brands including Lancome skin products, Giorgio Armani fragrances
and Helena Rubinstein make-up, experienced sales growth of 10.2 per cent to
FFr33.44bn from FFr30.36bn .
Earnings per share rose by 19.7 per cent to FFr34.7 from FFr29. The board
proposed raising the dividend by 20 per cent to FFr8.4, from FFr7 a share.
The cosmetics division, which invested heavily last year in the relaunch of
the Helena Rubinstein business acquired three years ago, saw sales rise by
11.6 per cent to FFr29.51bn from FFr26.45bn. Mr Owen-Jones said the response
to the Rubinstein relaunch had been 'extremely thrilling'.
The weakest area was perfume and beauty, where L'Oreal, like its
competitors, was affected by the problems of the luxury goods market, which
has suffered from the recession in the US and the slowdown in Japan. L'Oreal
also lost FFr60m on its investment in Lanvin, the Paris fashion house now
being relaunched in a joint venture with the Recamier family.
L'Oreal plans to launch a new Armani women's scent this year and a male
version of its Paloma fragrance. Synthelabo, the pharmaceutical division,
recently expanded with the acquisition of two laboratories in France.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
HONEYWELL, the US controls group, reported a sharp rise in first-quarter
income, boosted by a payment of Dollars 127.5m from Minolta, the Japanese
camera manufacturer, to settle a patent infringement dispute.
Net income for the quarter rose to Dollars 116.8m, or Dollars 1.67 per
share, from Dollars 71.8m, or Dollars 1.01, in the same period last year.
Worldwide sales revenues rose to Dollars 1.48bn from Dollars 1.47bn. 'In the
first quarter, we produced solid earnings in the midst of a languid
economy,' said Mr James J. Renier, chairman and chief executive officer.
The gain from the Minolta settlement was Dollars 108.3m after deducting
expenses associated with the legal dispute.
Honeywell also took a Dollars 32.1m pre-tax charge for costs associated with
'productivity improvement programmes and the anticipated disposition of
certain non-strategic product lines'. It said this would include a number of
job cuts.
'On a comparable basis, Honeywell earned Dollars 1.02 per share in the first
quarter of 1992, which is consistent with our expectations,' Mr Renier said.

FT  15 APR 92 / International Company News: Losses deepen at Boise Cascade
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BOISE CASCADE, the US forest products group, remained in the red during the
first three months of 1992, reporting an after-tax loss of Dollars 42.9m.
This compares with a Dollars 16.8m deficit in the same period a year
earlier. Sales fell from Dollars 992.7m to Dollars 953m.
Boise, based in Idaho, blamed 'severely depressed prices' for some of its
key paper grades for the loss.
It said that prices for most grades of pulp and paper were down on a year
ago, while prices for its most important products fell 'substantially' from
already-depressed fourth quarter levels.
This latter category includes coated and uncoated business and printing
papers and newsprint.
Boise Cascade shares closed down Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 20 7/8 .
International Paper, another of the large US paper and packaging companies,
reported first-quarter profits after tax of Dollars 102m. Superficially,
this appeared to be a considerable improvement on the first-quarter loss of
Dollars 87m last year  - but the 1991 figure was struck after a one-off
accounting charge. The underlying 1991 figure stood at Dollars 128m.
Like Boise, International Paper cited declining printing and writing paper
prices as the principal reason for the fall in underlying profits. However,
it added a more optimistic note as well, saying that first-quarter profits
from distribution and specialty products, and from timber and wood products
had improved year-on-year.

CANADIAN PACIFIC Forest Products has reported a loss of CDollars 71.1m
(USDollars 59.70), or Dollars 1.47 a share, in the first quarter of this
year, writes Robert Gibbens in Montreal. It blamed lower newsprint
shipments, poor prices for all products except timber and higher interest
costs.
A year earlier, the pulp and paper arm of Canadian Pacific incured a loss of
CDollars 50.1m, or Dollars 1.14 a share. Sales in the quarter were CDollars
430m against CDollars 488m.
Lower operating costs and a lower Canadian dollar continued to help, and
proceeds of a CDollars 218m equity issue had been used to reduce debt.
Pulp prices are firming and timber is up 25 per cent in the US since January
1. Newsprint prices, however, remain depressed, while paperboard and
packaging and white papers are improving.

FT  15 APR 92 / International Company News: Sales fall 29% at LA Gear
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KAREN ZAGOR
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
LA GEAR, the embattled US athletic shoe and apparel maker, is once more in
technical default of its bank credit facilities after posting a
first-quarter loss.
In the first three months of 1992, the company suffered a loss from
continuing operations of Dollars 6.3m or 32 cents a share, against a loss of
Dollars 11.1m or 56 cents a year earlier. The net loss in the latest quarter
was Dollars 8.2m or 42 cents, compared with Dollars 12.5m or 63 cents in the
1991 quarter, which included a loss of Dollars 1.4m or 7 cents from
discontinued operations.
Net sales fell 29.5 per cent to Dollars 109.6m from Dollars 155.3m a year
ago.
Mr Mark Goldston, chief operating officer, blamed the falling sales on a
drop in the number of shoes sold worldwide and lower average selling prices.
'A substantial part of the volume decrease occurred in the domestic market
as a result of increased competition and continued weak demand from
department store and athletic footwear store customers,' he added.
LA Gear has been in the throes of reorganisation since it posted its first
loss in the fourth quarter of 1990.
Last May, the company had agreed to sell a 30 per cent stake to Trefoil
Capital Investors, a fund led by Mr Roy Disney, nephew of the late Walt
Disney and vice-chairman of the entertainment company.
Trefoil is believed to have pressed for the resignation of Mr Robert
Greenberg, LA Gear's founder, chairman and chief executive, who was replaced
earlier this year by Mr Stanley Gold, Trefoil's managing director.
Trefoil's role in LA Gear is expected to increase as a result of the latest
default.
The company said it did not expect to be able to satisfy the conditions
attached to the payment of preferred stock dividends at any time during
fiscal 1992.
As a result, Trefoil would have the right to elect additional directors and
would have the exclusive right to elect a majority of the company's board of
directors at the end of August.
On Wall Street, shares in LA Gear closed down Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 12
5/8 . Wall Street analysts had expected a first-quarter loss.

FT  15 APR 92 / International Company News: US brokers post record earnings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE CLEAREST evidence yet of Wall Street's sparkling first quarter was
provided yesterday when three large US securities houses, Merrill Lynch,
PaineWebber and Charles Schwab, reported record earnings for the opening
three months.
Profits at Merrill Lynch, the largest securities house in the US, rose 53
per cent to Dollars 277.5m, at PaineWebber they jumped 135 per cent to
Dollars 74.3m, and at Charles Schwab, the west coast-based broker, they
soared 180 per cent to Dollars 29.7m.
The figures show the momentum from late last year, when a big cut in US
interest rates lured more individual investors back into stocks, spurred
large issues of corporate debt and equity, and lifted share prices, was
maintained in the first quarter of this year.
Commission fees from individual investor business, asset management
revenues, earnings from stock and bond underwritings and principal trading
revenues were all higher over the three months. Expenses, other than
performance-related compensation which rose sharply, held relatively steady
due to cost containment measures.
Merrill Lynch fully capitalised on its position as the country's biggest
retail stockbroker and the world's busiest corporate debt and equity
underwriter during the quarter.
Total revenues for the period increased 9 per cent to a record Dollars
3.4bn. Revenues from investment banking were Dollars 361m, principal
transactions, Dollars 574m; commissions, Dollars 685m; while asset
management and custodial business registered Dollars 220m.
Although non-interest expenses at Merrill Lynch climbed 14 per cent in the
quarter to Dollars 1.7bn, the rise was due primarily to a rise in costs
related to business activity, profitability and compensation.
At PaineWebber, revenues increased 39 per cent to a record Dollars 658.7m
with its core businesses  - retail sales and marketing, capital markets,
asset management and investment banking  - recording improvements in
earnings.
The biggest increase was in PaineWebber's investment banking revenues, which
more than doubled to Dollars 97.9m.
San Francisco-based broker Charles Schwab saw its first-quarter earnings
leap 180 per cent to a record Dollars 29.7m, based on revenues of Dollars
219.9m.
Big increases were reported throughout the company's business. Commission
revenues rose 62 per cent to Dollars 137.3m, assets in client accounts
increased 40 per cent to a record Dollars 51bn, and average daily trading
activity gained 47 per cent.
Analysts believe the securities industry will be unable to maintain the
first-quarter pace of earnings growth throughout the rest of the year. US
interest rates are unlikely to fall much further, the rate of new corporate
debt and equity issues has slowed, and stock prices have remained stuck in a
narrow trading range.
The companies' shares improved in early trading on the New York Stock
Exchange yesterday, but profit-taking reduced their gains. Merrill fell
Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 50 1/8 , PaineWebber was unchanged at Dollars 20 3/4
and Charles Schwab added Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 29 1/2 .

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FIRST Interstate Bancorp, one of the largest banks on the west coast of the
US, said yesterday it had talked recently to Kohlberg Kravis Roberts (KKR),
the leveraged buy-out specialists, about the possibility of holding
discussions on potential 'co-operative' transactions.
Such transactions might involve First Interstate in acquiring thrifts or
banking operations in its existing geographic territory, the statement said,
and could lead to KKR making an additional investment in First Interstate's
shares or other securities.
The west coast bank stressed no deal was currently on the table. However,
KKR already holds a 9.69 per cent stake in First Interstate and the 'talks
about talks' caused the New York-based firm, best known for its Dollars 25bn
bid for RJR Nabisco, to make a new filing with the Securities and Exchange
Commission.
KKR said it believed that, if talks started, it might be unable to avail
itself of the 'solely for the purpose of investment' exception to the
anti-trust filing requirements. The firm added it did not intend to take its
voting stake in First Interstate beyond 10 per cent.
The Los Angeles-based bank tumbled into the red last year, hit by the
deterioration in the Californian economy and property market.
The bank's statement comes only days after it was disclosed that Aetna, the
large US insurer, has been talking to KKR about a possible buy-out of its
reinsurance subsidiary, American Re. This underlined KKR's current interest
in the financial services sector, where  - in conjunction with
Fleet/Nordstar  - it recently acquired the failed Bank of New England.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PFIZER, one of the biggest US drug companies, yesterday unveiled a 10 per
cent increase in first-quarter net income on sales which rose 4 per cent.
In February, Pfizer had warned that its first-half profits would grow only
modestly, and shares in the company held steady yesterday at Dollars 73 3/4
on Wall Street.
Pfizer's net income in the first three months of 1992 was Dollars 295.1m, or
87 cents a share, on sales of Dollars 1.76bn compared with Dollars 267.4m,
or 79 cents, on sales of Dollars 1.7bn a year ago. Stripping out divested

Shiley heart valves who become ill or die.

FT  15 APR 92 / International Company News: NY Times doubles earnings to
Dollars 13.9m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN FRIEDMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A RECOVERY in advertising revenue and lower newsprint costs helped The New
York Times to more than double net profits to Dollars 13.9m in the first
three months of 1992.
The profits rise, which translates into earnings of 18 cents per share,
against 7 cents in the first quarter of 1991, was struck on revenues of
Dollars 440.4m, up by 5.6 per cent.
The company attributed the much higher 1992 advertising revenues in its
newspaper and magazine divisions partly to the weakness experienced during
the opening months of last year, when advertising in US media was generally
depressed by the mood associated with the war against Iraq.
Increased advertising rates also helped revenues.
The flagship New York Times, together with 32 regional papers and a 50 per
cent stake in the International Herald Tribune, turned in an operating
profit of Dollars 32.2m in the first quarter, up sharply from Dollars 18.6m
in the first quarter of 1991.
The group's magazines division made an operating profit of just under
Dollars 2m in the first quarter of 1992, compared with a Dollars 2.4m loss
in the same period last year.
The broadcasting and information services division of the group benefited
from higher advertising revenues and achieved operating income of Dollars
2.9m in the opening quarter of 1992, against Dollars 2m a year ago.
Net interest expenses declined to Dollars 6.5m in the first quarter, from
Dollars 7.9m for the same period a year ago.

FT  15 APR 92 / International Company News: GTE lifts net income to Dollars

GTE, the largest local telephone company in the US, yesterday reported an
underlying increase in earnings per share in the three months to end-March.
GTE said total net income was Dollars 427m, compared with Dollars 201m in
the same period a year earlier. However, the first quarter of 1991 bore a
one-off charge, totalling Dollars 204m at the after-tax level, related to
the merger with Contel and the gain on the transfer of certain cellular
telephone assets.
Stripping out the effect of this and discontinued operations, GTE calculated
a 7 per cent improvement in earnings per share, with sales for the quarter
reaching Dollars 4.8bn, against Dollars 4.7bn a year ago.
GTE said it was pleased with the figures given the economic environment. It
added that all business areas showed an improvement, with the telephone and
cellular-mobile units faring particularly well.
Revenues on the telephone side rose 1 per cent to Dollars 3.8bn, while
operating profits were up 6 per cent at more than Dollars 1bn.
On the telecommunications products and services side, there was a 7 per cent
revenue gain, at Dollars 977m, with operating profits up from Dollars 18m to
Dollars 39m.
AMERITECH, one of the seven Baby Bells, said its first-quarter results
revealed signs that the Midwest's economy was emerging from the national
recession, writes Barbara Durr in Chicago.
Its net income for the first quarter was Dollars 337m, up 19.1 per cent over
last year's Dollars 283m. Earnings per share were Dollars 1.26 for the three
months ended March 31, compared with Dollars 1.07 a year ago.
Mr William Weiss, Ameritech's chairman, said the rate of line growth was
improving and that customers were using the telephones more.
Net income for the first quarter also included Dollars 28m, or about 10
cents per share, from interest income on a settlement with the Internal
Revenue Service.
Without the IRS settlement's interest, earnings per share were Dollars 1.16,
up 8.4 per cent.

A SHARP improvement in first-quarter results from American Home Products,
the US pharmaceutical company, prompted active trading in the company's
shares.
The New York-based company said net income grew 15 per cent to Dollars
406.3m, or Dollars 1.29 a share, in the first three months of 1992, compared
with Dollars 352.5m, or Dollars 1.12, a year earlier. Sales advanced 13 per
cent to Dollars 2bn from Dollars 1.76bn.
Sales growth was led by American Home Product's consumer health care
business, which saw a 20 per cent increase to Dollars 438.8bn.
Pharmaceutical sales rose 16 per cent to Dollars 1.16bn, while medical
supplies and diagnostics were only 2 per cent higher at Dollars 197.8m. Food
products sales fell 1 per cent in the quarter.
The company said two new drugs - Lodine for osteoarthritis and its Norplant
birth control implant - contributed to the strong pharmaceutical sales.
Wall Street reacted enthusiastically to the figures, marking American Home
Products shares closed Dollars 4 higher to Dollars 81 3/4 in active trading.
Genentech, a leading US biotechnology company which is controlled by the
Swiss group Hoffmann-La Roche, yesterday unveiled first-quarter net earnings
of Dollars 3.5m, or 3 cents a share, on revenues of Dollars 129m, against
income of Dollars 19.4m, or 17 cents, on sales of Dollars 99.5m last year.
The drop in income was attributed to the company's previously announced
increase in spending on research and development for 1992.
During the quarter, sales of Genentech's Protropin human growth hormone rose
10.3 per cent to Dollars 48.4m. Sales of the company's thrombolytic (clot
dissolver) Activase t-PA fell 19.8 per cent to Dollars 44.5m, reflecting
results of a controversial clinical trial.

<TEXT>
BANC ONE, the Ohio-based commercial banking group that has been aggressively
expanding through takeovers, yesterday announced the acquisition of Valley
National Bank of Arizona in a stock deal worth Dollars 1.2bn.
The acquisition of Valley National will increase Banc One's assets by
Dollars 11bn and make the Ohio institution the dominant bank in the Arizona
market.
This, in turn, will place Banc One in direct competition in the state with
the Bank of America.
The acquisition, the third by Banc One in the past four months, caused
Standard &amp; Poor's, the US rating service, to place about Dollars 921m of the
bank's debt on credit-watch for a possible downgrade. S&amp;P's concern was
mainly about asset quality problems at Valley National.
Banc One said it would seek to 'work through the concerns raised by Standard
&amp; Poor's'.
Banking analysts have generally been less troubled because Banc One is
considered an extremely well-run, super-regional institution with strong
earnings and a 7.7 per cent common equity-to-assets ratio.
Since the start of 1991 Banc One has made 11 acquisitions, including the
Dollars 782m purchase last month of Team Bancshares, the sixth largest bank
in Texas.
While the US banking system has been licking its wounds as a result of heavy
commercial property loan losses, Banc One has more than doubled its assets
over the past 15 months, from Dollars 30bn to Dollars 72bn.
With yesterday's deal, the bank holding company will control 57 separate
banks with 1,296 branches in 11 states. Banc One is thus well on its way to
becoming one of the most national of US retail banking groups.
Last year Banc One out-performed the US industry with a 25 per cent increase
in net profits, to Dollars 529.5m. Its success has been based on
conservative lending policies and a focus on lucrative business areas in and
near the midwest. Among the bank's other acquisitions last year were First
Illinois, together with banks in Indiana, Kentucky and Colorado.
Wall Street marked Banc One's share price Dollars 1 1/2 lower yesterday, to
Dollars 45 5/8 at close of trading.

FT  15 APR 92 / International Company News: MGM survival called into
question by auditor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN FRIEDMAN

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE survival of MGM, the once legendary Hollywood studio that has been
financially crippled by heavy debts and a lengthy legal dispute over its
ownership, was questioned yesterday by KPMG Peat Marwick, the company's
auditor.
In a report on MGM's 1991 results, which showed a total loss of Dollars
347.4m on revenues of Dollars 921.7m, the auditor questioned whether MGM
would be able to continue as 'a going concern'.
MGM's loss in the last quarter of 1991 was Dollars 114.2m on revenues of
Dollars 218.7m.
Peat Marwick's unusual qualification of the MGM accounts is based on the
fact that the studio is in default on Dollars 600m of loans from Credit
Lyonnais of France, and is dependent on the French state bank for additional
capital to fund its ongoing operation.
Although the company is trying to work out a new business plan with the
bank, which is also its majority shareholder, the auditor noted that there
was presently no commitment from Credit Lyonnais for the advance of
additional cash to MGM.
Mr Alan Ladd, the co-chairman of MGM, yesterday blamed the studio's woes on
'the disastrous actions and decisions of prior management.'
Mr Ladd was referring to the management of Mr Giancarlo Parretti, the
controversial Italian financier who in late 1990 paid Dollars 1.3bn to buy
MGM from Mr Kirk Kerkorian, the casino and hotel mogul.
Mr Parretti, who is appealing a four-year prison sentence and fraud
conviction in Naples, borrowed close to Dollars 1bn from Credit Lyonnais's
Netherlands office and secured the debt with MGM stock. The making of these
loans, in turn, has placed the chairman and top management of Credit
Lyonnais under intense scrutiny in Paris.
MGM was paralysed for much of last year as Mr Parretti and Credit Lyonnais
engaged in a vicious series of lawsuits against each other. Three months ago
a Delaware court finally ruled in favour of the French bank and gave control
of management and the board of directors back to Credit Lyonnais.
Mr Dennis Stanfill, the newly appointed co-chairman of MGM in charge of
finance, yesterday tried to put a brave face on the state of affairs at MGM.
'The key here is that we have the co-operation of the bank and we are
working with them to develop a long-term business plan. We hope to have one
in the near future,' Mr Stanfill said.
MGM's auditors also expressed concern about the 'risk of certain litigation
resulting in ultimate liabilities to MGM possibly in excess of current
provisions'.

Conforama for FFr4.83bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PINAULT, the French industrial concern which recently won control of the Au
Printemps department store group, has agreed terms to sell Conforama,
France's largest chain of furniture stores, to Au Printemps for FFr4.83bn
(Dollars 867m).
The decision to sell Conforama, which Pinault bought last year from the Au
Bon Marche retail group for FFr4.4bn in an ingeniously financed deal, forms
part of the long-standing strategy formulated by Mr Francois Pinault,
chairman, for the Au Printemps group.
Mr Pinault has just emerged from the cloud of controversy that greeted his
partial bid for Au Printemps. The bid caused a storm of complaints from
minority shareholders frustrated at being excluded from the deal. It is one
of the chief catalysts for the French government's ongoing review of
takeover legislation.
The sale of Conforama  - at a higher price than that paid by Pinault in May
last year  - will help the group to defray the cost of buying its majority
stake in Au Printemps.
Conforama  - France's biggest single furniture chain and the second largest
electrical retailer after the Darty group  - saw its net profits slip by 13
per cent to FFr260m on sales of FFr7bn last year.

NORWEB, the regional electricity supply company, is to start marketing gas.
It will be the fourth regional electricity company, after Midlands, Eastern,
Seeboard and Scottish Power, to try to undercut British Gas by competing in
the gas supply market.
The gas will be marketed by Northern Gas, a joint-venture between Norweb and
UtiliCorp United, the US electricity and gas company. Norweb has 75 per cent
of the venture.
The move will put more pressure on British Gas, which has agreed with the
Office of Fair Trading to halve its share of the industrial gas market by
1995.
Northern Gas will begin by distributing North Sea gas to 50-100 small and
medium-sized industrial and commercial consumers using over 25,000 therms.
The gas will initially be supplied by UtiliCorp which has interests in the
Indefatigable and Leman oil fields.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JA Devenish, the west country-based pub operator, yesterday announced that
it is leasing 115 pubs from Whitbread.
The pubs, which will be leased for eight years free of tied beer supplies,
increase the Devenish estate by 25 per cent to more than 500 pubs.
Mr John Clark, chief executive, said the pubs are located in two of the
company's development areas, along the M5 corridor and on the south coast
around Bournemouth, Southampton and Swanage. 'They provide us with a good
opportunity to expand our business without initial capital outlay,' he said.
Whitbread bought Devenish's beer brands for Pounds 9.75m during its
successful campaign against a takeover bid from Boddington last year and
supplies a range of beers to the company.
As part of its requirement to free 2,250 pubs from exclusive beer supplies
by November this year, Whitbread is planning a number of similar leasing
deals with regional brewers and pub retailers.

FT  15 APR 92 / UK Company News: RMC declines further to Pounds 167m -
Squeeze on margins and higher interest charges behind the fall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FALLING DEMAND for ready-mixed concrete in the UK hit RMC Group's profits
for the second year running, with the pre-tax figure of Pounds 167m in 1991
down from Pounds 216m in 1990 and Pounds 248m in 1989.
However, the group proposes a slightly higher final dividend of 13.4p to
give a total of 20p (19.3p). The dividend is covered 1.8 times by earnings
per share of 36p (57.9p).
The shares rose 22p in response to 606p.
Last September when the group reported interim results, Mr Jim Owen,
managing director, said that RMC would do well to match the 1991 profits in
1992. Mr Derek Jenkins, finance director, said yesterday that that view
still held, although he confessed to being 'a bit confident'.
Group sales were 8 per cent up at Pounds 2.8bn, but operating profits fell
by 16 per cent to Pounds 195m, reflecting a squeeze on margins.
Associates, mainly the company in Israel, contributed Pounds 6.7m (Pounds
4.1m).
Interest charges rose from Pounds 19.8m to Pounds 33.9m. Mr Jenkins said
that reflected a full year of financing the acquisition in eastern Germany
made at the end of 1990, and the capital expenditure programme of Pounds
248m in 1991 (Pounds 311m).
Interest cover was still 5.9 times (11.9).
The tax rate rose to 35.2 per cent (32.7 per cent) because of the higher
proportion of profits made in Germany, and minorities rose from Pounds 33.2m
to Pounds 38.5m again mainly reflecting the rise in German profits.
Operating profits from the UK fell 61 per cent to Pounds 34.9m, on sales 12
per cent lower at Pounds 903.6m.
Mr Jenkins said that the UK businesses all suffered. Ready-mixed volumes
were down about 20 per cent and a further 5 per cent fall might be seen in
1992.
However, he said reductions in capacity by RMC and its competitors were
beginning to arrest the fall in prices.
There was some hope that housing activity might pick up following the
election result, and this would help the group's Great Mills DIY stores. But
Mr Jenkins said he saw no recovery in commercial building until 1993.
In Germany operating profits rose 26 per cent to Pounds 90.4m on sales up 32
per cent to Pounds 926.7m. Mr Jenkins said that forecasts of slower economic
growth in Germany did not take account of expansion in eastern Germany where
RMC is building a cement plant and increasing the number of ready mix plants
it has. He said RMC hoped to at least maintain its German profits in 1992.
Elsewhere in the EC, operating profits fell 3.2 per cent to Pounds 55.1m as
lower profits from the Irish Republic, Belgium and the Netherlands offset
good performances in France and Spain.
Other countries, such as Israel and Austria, increased profits from Pounds
13.6m to Pounds 14.2m.
The group's balance sheet showed net debt of Pounds 326m (Pounds 220m) if
the Pounds 78m convertible capital bond is treated as debt rather than
equity. The bonds, which mature in 2006, have a conversion price of 810p.
Shareholders funds were Pounds 695m (Pounds 662m) and minority interests
Pounds 225m (Pounds 179m).

FT  15 APR 92 / UK Company News: Pounds 11m turnround puts Beckenham in red
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DON FARRELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN OPERATING deficit, substantial write-offs, and greatly increased interest
charges put Beckenham Group into a pre-tax loss of Pounds 5.45m in the year
to October 31.
That marked an Pounds 11m downswing on the Pounds 5.6m profit achieved in
the previous year.
Losses per share were 11p (earnings 7.9p). The final dividend is omitted,
leaving the total at 0.5p (3p). The dividend on the 9 per cent redeemable
cumulative preference shares will not be paid.
Mr Christopher Egleton, chairman of this group of contractors and
distributors, said the greatest difficulties were at Duffy Femwork, where
the group acquired an outstanding two thirds interest from the joint venture
partners. It made ductwork for Canary Wharf.
Recession had a deeper effect than anticipated at the halfway mark, with
contract starting dates delayed and pressure om margins increased. The
result was a 13 per cent decrease in turnover for continuing operations and
an operating loss of Pounds 2.45m.
A large scale reorganisation was put in hand. Resulting costs were heavy,
amounting to some Pounds 2.7m in redundancies and other closure costs and
write-downs, in addition to those for Docklands, and there were write-offs
for subsidiaries sold in previous years. The provisions have been taken as
Pounds 1.92m exceptional and Pounds 3.58m extraordinary.

The loss stems from the appointment of receivers to their client,

FT  15 APR 92 / Bid For Midland: Institutional holders disappointed by bid
level
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD and ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MIDLAND BANK's instit-utional shareholders yesterday expressed
disappointment at the recommended offer by HSBC Holdings as it emerged that
the Kuwait Investment Office had failed to reduce its 10.5 per cent holding
to 3 per cent.
The KIO is keen to secure cash upfront, at about 360p a share, for most of
its Midland shareholding rather than wait to take the Hongkong and Shanghai
Bank's paper and cash offer, valuing Midland shares at 378p.
However, it is thought that the KIO had failed to work up demand for its
shares which it continues to hold.
M&amp;G, which holds just under 6 per cent of the banks' shares, and Phillips
and Drew Fund Managers, with about 4 per cent of the stock, expressed
disappointment that the offer was not closer to the 400p which most
shareholders had hoped for.
Some of the smaller institutional shareholders, including the Prudential,
Norwich Union, and Mercury Asset Management, are hoping that Lloyds may come
in with a bigger offer.
One senior fund manager said: 'The Hongkong bank is pricing this one on the
nail. If Lloyds counter bid with a bigger offer it would almost certainly be
accepted. Nor should anyone automatically assume that the offer will be
accepted without a counter bid.'
Some shareholders criticised the management of Midland for failing to drive
a harder bargain.
However, most institutional shareholders accepted that it would be highly
unlikely for the offer to be rejected without a counter bid.
It is almost without precedent for shareholders of one party which have
agreed to be bought by another party to force them back to the negotiating
table in order to secure a higher offer.
Another fund manager said: 'Without a counter bid the odds are that this
offer will be accepted, however reluctantly.'
Midland's advisers remain confident that Lloyds' share price was likely to
fall in the event of it launching a counter bid, making it harder for the
bank to top its offer of 378p a share.
City analysts were also disappointed by the terms of Hongkong Bank's offer
for Midland yesterday.
Mr John Aitken, banking analyst at County Nat West, said the value of the
offer was between 20p and 30p too low.
'Midland has squandered a chance to deliver a much better deal for
shareholders. Hongkong Bank is a forced buyer and there is a moral case for
a higher offer be-cause interest has been shown by another party,' he said.
Mr David Poutney at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew said Hongkong Bank's offer was
inadequate. 'Hongkong Bank is getting about 13 per cent of the UK banking
market with only a slight premium to net asset value when Midland has good
recovery prospects.
'Given the risks in the Far East, our clients wanted to see a bigger bid at
around 400p,' he said.
Analysts speculated that the lower-than-expected offer, and opposition to it
from institutional shareholders, left the door open for another bidder to
appear.

FT  15 APR 92 / Taylor Woodrow takes Pounds 47m charge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TAYLOR Woodrow, the property and construction group, yesterday said it was
pulling out of US contracting and made exceptional write-downs of Pounds
46.5m to cover falls in UK and Spanish property and land values.
Mr Colin Parsons, who took over as chairman after Mr Peter Drew resigned
last month, is to simplify Taylor Woodrow's management. He will lead an
executive team of Mr Tony Palmer, chief executive, and Mr David Green,
finance director.
The company reported a loss before tax of Pounds 2.7m in the year to
December 31 compared with a profit of Pounds 83.4m a year ago. Mr Parsons
described the performance as 'far from satisfactory', and said costs needed
pruning. About 600 people have been made redundant, at a cost of about
Pounds 5m, and more redundancies are expected.
The results continued a string of disappointing performances and asset
write-downs from UK construction and property companies, hit by recession.
Taylor Woodrow is maintaining its final dividend, as earlier promised, at
7.64p to make an unchanged total of 9.5p. The shares gained 9p to 129p.
Mr Parsons defended the decision on the dividend, which is uncovered. 'It's
simply a matter of honour to pay that dividend.' Following last year's
rights issue, the company's debt/equity ratio improved to 23 per cent, from
30 per cent, on net borrowings of Pounds 156m, down from Pounds 205.1m.
Turnover fell slightly to Pounds 1.39bn from Pounds 1.41bn. The order book
finished the year at Pounds 850m against Pounds 1.25bn. Profits before
exceptionals fell to Pounds 43.8m from Pounds 75.9m. Worst hit was the
contracting division with losses of Pounds 19.6m, against a profit of Pounds
14.1m last time, following provisions of Pounds 11.5m on Taylor Woodrow's
share of the Channel tunnel, a Pounds 13m provision on the Storebaelt bridge
contract in Denmark and a Pounds 3.8m provision on Euro Disney contracts. In
the US, contracting ran up losses of Pounds 12m before being discontinued.
There was a loss per share of 1.4p, against earnings of 16.2p, adjusted.
Losses attributable to shareholders totalled Pounds 28.9m, against a Pounds
55.6m profit. Combined with a higher dividend charge, due to the rights
issue, there was a retained loss of Pounds 68.6m, against a Pounds 24m
profit.

FT  15 APR 92 / Digging a path out of the trough: Signs of hope for
construction equipment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
About six months' supply of hydraulic excavators is piling up outside
factories and at dealers' yards worldwide, according to the UK head of one
international supplier of construction equipment.
The stocks of unsold equipment bear witness to a global recession in the
construction equipment industry. For a sector that has always found it
difficult to face head-on the problems of overcapacity, they provide a
counterpoint to the ballyhoo of the world's largest construction equipment
exhibition, Bauma, in Munich last week.
'Last year was bad for the industry. All our weaknesses have been exposed.
Apart from Germany, it went all the way through the system,' says Mr Tuve
Johannesson, president and chief executive of VME Group, the big Swedish/US
producer.
VME and other big suppliers agree that, over the past two years, reunified
Germany has been a lifesaver for the industry. On the back of eastern
Germany's need to develop its infrastructure, reunified Germany now accounts
for 37 per cent of the western European equipment market, against 18 per
cent for west Germany in 1989, said London-based Corporate Intelligence
Group recently.
As German growth begins to level off, the first sparks of life elsewhere are
beginning to appear. Last week, the salesmen at Bauma were desperately
fanning the flames. Inquiries from non-German visitors to the stands were
higher than expected. The result was a mood of hope, rather than the
expectancy that characterised Bauma in 1989, when many markets boomed.
Since then, recession has spread from Australasia to North America, the UK
and more recently continental Europe. On top of that has come the collapse
of housing and construction markets.
In the UK, says a Scottish equipment buyer, 'you can virtually name your
price'. In the US, the Illinois-based analyst Manfredi &amp; Associates
estimates that 1991 was the second-worst year on record.
Outside Germany, European markets slipped badly last year, and business
conditions in Scandinavia are dire. The collapse of communism has converted
the former Soviet Union and eastern bloc countries into long-term prospects
but snuffed out immediate opportunities.
Even in Japan, equipment sales are falling. The hydraulic excavator market,
the largest in the world, is running at around 45,000 units a year against
the normal 60,000, says Mr H. Jay Takahashi, an international sales manager
at Hitachi Construction Machinery. 'Everything went down right after the
political scandals,' he says.
Overall, the world construction equipment industry lost money heavily last
year  - the leader, Caterpillar, suffered a Dollars 404m (Pounds 234m) loss,
its first since 1984. A number of companies are in trouble, although only
the handful of publicly quoted suppliers such as Tenneco, currently
restructuring its JI Case subsidiary, are forced to disclose their
difficulties.
On the whole, however, it is hard to avoid the conclusion that the industry
is to blame for its problems. Well-used to roller-coaster trading
conditions, it is financially weakened by overcapacity of perhaps 20 per
cent, while its structural fragmentation leads to duplication of effort.
Big companies such as Caterpillar, VME and Case have been forced to
rationalise in the recession. Cat has shed 2,400 white-collar jobs in the
past year, and has been in an acrimonious labour dispute that now appears to
be ending after efforts by mediators to restore peace.
The rationalisations are partially frustrated, however, by an unwillingness
among smaller European producers to give up their independence or forge
links with competitors to rationalise manufacturing capacity and products.
And while German reunification has kept the industry going over the past
year, it may also encourage smaller German beneficiaries to defer strategic
decisions which could collectively lift prices and profits.
The larger companies, meanwhile, have realised that restructuring and
cross-border co-operation must continue as each pursues the same objective
 -a viable presence in the world's three main markets of North America,
western Europe and Japan.
An announcement may be made soon on the most important deal being
negotiated, a three-way European joint venture between Fiat of Italy,
Hitachi and Deere of the US. But it is rumoured Deere has pulled out,
unhappy about distribution arrangements for the backhoe loader it was due to
contribute to the venture.
Of other deals in the pipeline, the most important involves the future of
O&amp;K, the German construction and mining equipment subsidiary of Hoesch, the
German steel group being taken over by its domestic rival Krupp.
Observers believe that Mannesmann Demag of Germany is the strongest
contender for O&amp;K's loss-making construction equipment side, although other
potential purchasers such as VME have been mentioned.
The third big question mark surrounds Clark Equipment's lift truck business,
up for sale since the autumn with a product range that could tempt European
or Korean rivals.
Such deals might help the industry avoid over-producing when next it hits a
downturn. Meanwhile, the market outlook is beginning to improve, albeit
somewhat patchily.
Mr Glen Barton, Caterpillar group president, says there are early
indications the US market is looking up, and last week's Fed fund rates
reduction should help the housing market. The projected rate of recovery for
the US economy is slower than normal, good year'.
Elsewhere, the improving economies of Latin America, excluding Brazil, are
the only growth spot other than Germany. Most of Europe remains in
recession, although Mr Barton says the Italian market is 'reasonable' and
sees 'a little bit of stability in Spain'. For many at Bauma, though, the
immediate question was how long can the German boom last  - growth is
already slowing after the surge of equipment buying last year.
Mr Michael Michaelis, export manager at Liebherr, the German-Swiss producer
which has been one of the leading beneficiaries of reunification, is
untroubled: 'The German boom will end, but by then other markets will have
picked up.' The early signs suggest he could be right.

FT  15 APR 92 / IBM lifts revenues 3.3% in quarter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   SAN FRANCISCO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
INTERNATIONAL Business Machines has reported a rise in revenue and earnings
for the first quarter, reversing a year-long decline. The computer group
said US revenues rose almost 10 per cent in the quarter. However, sales
outside the US remained flat.
Worldwide revenue for the first quarter of 1992 was Dollars 14bn (Pounds
8bn), up 3.3 per cent from Dollars 13.6bn a year ago. Net earnings from
operations for the three months were Dollars 595m, or Dollars 1.04 per
share. This compared with Dollars 556m, or 97 cents, a year earlier when IBM
took a Dollars 2.26bn charge against earnings reflecting a change in
accounting for health benefits. Net losses were Dollars 2.99 a share.
Comparisons with 1991 first quarter results were further complicated by the
restatement of earnings to reflect a new accounting method for software
revenue which increased earnings from operations by 4 cents a share.
'Overall, we're pleased with these results and believe we're on track toward
achieving our financial objectives for the year,' said Mr John Akers,
chairman.
IBM's results cheered Wall Street which had predicted earnings of between 90
cents and 95 cents for the quarter. IBM shares rose to Dollars 88 3/8 at
close of trade from a Monday close of Dollars 87 1/2 .
Analysts said the first-quarter results were a significant step toward IBM's
recovery. Last year IBM reported its worst-ever financial results including
its first-ever annual loss of Dollars 2.8bn after charges and its first
revenue decline in 45 years.
IBM announced plans in December to eliminate up to 20,000 jobs worldwide
this year. The company also launched a reorganisation of its operations to
give business units greater autonomy.
Details of IBM's first-quarter earnings show that revenue from hardware
sales slipped 2.7 per cent to Dollars 7.12bn from Dollars 7.31bn in the
first quarter of 1991. However, IBM said its 'almost double-digit' growth in
US revenues was led by hardware sales and services.
Total revenue in Europe declined in the quarter, IBM said. However, Asia
Pacific revenue rose, helped by IBM Japan's acquisition of the remaining
interest in Computer Systems Leasing, a finance company that leases IBM
equipment to users.

FT  15 APR 92 / Labour leadership election set for July after NEC compromise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE OPENING shots in the Labour leadership battle were fired yesterday as Mr
Bryan Gould found himself with just 12 weeks to halt the formidable
bandwagon rolling for his rival Mr John Smith.
As both men declared their candidacies, the party's national executive
agreed a compromise July 18 date for the election's conclusion.
Minutes later, Mr John Prescott, the Labour transport spokesman, became the
third candidate to enter the race by declaring his bid for the deputy
leadership, a post also being contested by Mr Gould.
The NEC's decision, reached by a 15 to 10 vote after a two-hour debate, was
reluctantly accepted by Mr Gould's supporters. They had been hoping to
maximise the period of debate in the belief that a longer campaign would
increase the shadow environment secretary's chances of winning round the
undecided.
Mr Neil Kinnock, the outgoing leader who had wanted a late June election,
said the July date was acceptable. But supporters of a motion by leftwingers
for an October election at the party conference said their 18 to 7 defeat
was a victory for Mr Smith and the party's right wing.
However, remarks from Mr Bill Jordan, the engineers' union leader, that
balloting members on the election would be 'a waste of time and money'
looked certain to spark fresh controversy.
At their opening news conferences, both Mr Smith and Mr Gould had called for
the fullest possible participation of unionists, including balloting
wherever feasible, to complement voting by MPs and constituency parties.
Mr Smith used his campaign launch to project his candidacy as the steady
continuation of the party and policy reform process undertaken by Mr
Kinnock.
Arguing for policies to convince voters that prosperity is best advanced by
a government which works for the welfare of the whole community, he said:
'Modern government should be pluralistic, decentralised and should be
underpinned by recognition of individual rights.'
In an effort to present himself as the candidate for change, Mr Gould
insisted that the party needed 'a period of serious reflection about what
went wrong and what needs to be done'.
Promising a 'positive and radical' agenda, he clearly sought to portray Mr
Smith as the 'steady as she goes' candidate who would not seek fundamental
shifts in policy.
'One more heave may have been the right response to our 1987 defeat,' he
said. 'It is a wholly inadequate response to our 1992 defeat. We cannot
simply change the face at the top and expect to win in 1996 on the programme
on which we lost in 1992.'
There were also clear differences between the two men on economic policy. Mr
Gould said it was now necessary to discuss broader economic issues beyond
the 'very narrow terrain' of tax policy, such as Britain's weighting in the
European exchange rate mechanism. Mr Smith has always insisted that a Labour
government would not tamper with sterling's exchange rate.

FT  15 APR 92 / Russian government wins chance to continue reforms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LEYLA BOULTON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Russian government yes-terday appeared to secure a hard-won compromise
with parliament, allowing it to remain in power and pursue unpopular
economic reforms, at least in the short term.
The compromise document, adopted by deputies as a basis for discussion,
still needs to be approved today. However, the political pressure for an
agreement is so strong that deputies are unlikely to reject it.
The draft accord, presented by Mr Yegor Gaidar, the first deputy prime
minister responsible for economic reform, and Mr Vladimir Shumeiko,
parliament's deputy speaker, frees the government from parliament's demands
for specific policy changes.
Without stating so explicitly, it also allows President Boris Yeltsin, who
currently heads the cabinet, to keep until December 1 his powers to rule by
decree, and to choose ministers.
The deal was achieved partly thanks to Mr Gaidar's warnings that a western
aid package of Dollars 24bn (Pounds 14bn) needed to underpin his reforms
could be lost if the government was forced to resign.
The western package now seems safe pending further upsets. But western
concern over Russian turmoil was underlined with a visit to Moscow yesterday
by Mr Nicholas Brady, the US Treasury secretary.
Before the compromise was announced, Mr Brady said: 'The matter of world
confidence in a reform programme here in Russia is one that is very
important in terms of the transfer of money to this country. Some of the
steps we have read about this week are steps backward in generating that
confidence.'
Mr Mikhail Gorbachev, the former Soviet president, added his weight to the
reforms, saying the future of world civilisation depended on their success.
Speaking in Tokyo, he appealed for investment in Russia. 'It is very
important for the global community to support this process of reform.'
The document's main concession to deputies commits the government to submit
by May 20 a list of measures to take 'into account economic and social
realities'. Mr Gaidar told parliament that he believed a majority of
deputies were in favour of an effective interaction with the executive.
'There are politically ambitious people . . . who want to hurt Russia, but
this is a misleading path,' he added. This was an apparent reference to Mr
Ruslan Khasbulatov, the parliamentary chairman who has been instrumental in
this week's showdown with the government.

FT  15 APR 92 / Annual pay rises remain above 7%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INCREASES IN pay are not falling as fast as employers and the government
have been hoping, according to the latest figures from the Confederation of
British Industry and the Department of Employment.
The Department of Employment is expected tomorrow to announce a slight drop
in the rise in underlying average earnings for February but this will not be
enough to push the annualised figure beneath 7 per cent.
Average earnings rising at more than 3 percentage points above inflation
will be a disappointment to Mrs Gillian Shephard, the new employment
secretary, who is also expected to announce a further large increase in
unemployment tomorrow.
She will take some comfort from the fact that the latest Manpower survey of
employment prospects shows a post-election surge in optimism.
There are also some positive signals in the latest Confederation of British
Industry pay databank figures, which show an increase in manufacturing pay
freezes in the first quarter to one in six of all settlements.
However, according to the CBI, average settlements in manufacturing have
risen slightly in the first quarter to 4.3 per cent compared with 4.2 per
cent in the last quarter of last year.
Productivity growth has fallen to 3.8 per cent from 5 per cent in the last
quarter of 1991. Unit labour costs in manufacturing are rising at about 4.7
per cent, which the CBI says is in line with Japan and Germany. Settlements
in the service sector were averaging 6 per cent in the second half of last
year, down from 7.1 per cent in the first half.
The government's average earnings index is slower to reflect the recession
and falling inflation because it takes into account all pay decisions over
the past 12 months.
But some analysts have been waiting since the summer for the annualised
average earnings figure to fall beneath 7 per cent for the first time since
the mid-1960s.
The pay of company executives continues to rise slightly faster than that of
other employees but the gap appears to be narrowing, according to the latest
survey by the business information group Noble Lowndes.

FT  15 APR 92 / Letter: Conservatives and community principles
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr BRYN JONES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, David Willetts ('Personal view', April 13) claims Majorite Conservatism
rests on a combination of markets and community. Unfortunately for this
aspiration, more than 100 years of both conservative and radical social
science have shown that market and community activities are inherently
contradictory. In a community, people act on the basis of moral values,
while markets work largely because values are excluded. As one of J G
Farrell's characters mockingly asks in his novel The Singapore Grip: 'Do you
expect a stockbroker to die for the Stock Exchange?'
On the other hand, pace David Willetts, support for welfare state
institutions, such as the National Health Service, is a reflection of moral
values. Contrary to Mr Willetts' view, the danger is that blanket support
for market processes will displace the shared values that sustain community
principles. If Conservatives are serious about 'community' they need to
re-think their blind faith in 'free' markets. Otherwise they may have to
face a more disillusioned electorate in 1997.

FT  15 APR 92 / An ambitious mission to mend a shattered land: Keeping the
peace and arranging elections in war-torn Cambodia is one of the biggest
challenges faced by the UN
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTOR MALLET
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When Mr Boutros Boutros-Ghali, the United Nations secretary general, visits
Cambodia on Friday to inspect one of the organisation's most ambitious
peacekeeping operations, he will find his UN soldiers and bureaucrats
confronting an unfamiliar challenge.
The UN in Cambodia is burdened not with the sort of intractable
international conflict to which it is accustomed in Cyprus, Lebanon or on
the borders of Iraq  - for once all the foreign powers and feuding domestic
factions have agreed on a peace plan. Instead, it faces the task of
rebuilding a nation and turning it into a functioning democracy in just over
a year.
The country has suffered more than two decades of civil war encompassing the
regime of the Khmer Rouge, the fanatical group responsible for the deaths of
an estimated 1m Cambodians between 1975 and 1978, and the Vietnamese
invasion which ended its reign of terror. Most Cambodians, from the refugee
camps on the Thai border to the flattened beach resort of Kep on the south
coast, are looking to the UN to resurrect their ruined land.
Mr Yasushi Akashi, the thoughtful 61-year-old Japanese who heads the UN
Transitional Authority in Cambodia (Untac), has no illusions about the
enormity of the task facing him and Lt-Gen John Sanderson, his Australian
military commander. They are seeking to implement the comprehensive Paris
peace accord concluded last October between international powers and the
four Cambodian factions: the Khmer Rouge, the Vietnamese - backed government
of Mr Hun Sen, the royalists, and Mr Son Sann's Khmer People's National
Liberation front.
By May 1993, according to the agreement, Untac is supposed to resettle
375,000 refugees from neighbouring Thailand, disarm 450,000 soldiers and
militiamen from the four main factions, and hold free elections: all this in
a country where many of the inhabitants have no experience of democracy,
where roads and communications are exceptionally poor, and where much of the
land has been made uninhabitable by mines. 'If one was a masochist one could
not wish for more,' said Mr Akashi.
Moreover, Mr Akashi has yet to be guaranteed he will receive the funds he
regards as necessary to do the job. He wants Dollars 1.9bn for Untac and its
proposed quota of more than 20,000 soldiers and officials, and a further
Dollars 900m in voluntary contributions to rebuild the country and resettle
the refugees.
He said he was disappointed at the delays in receiving finances. 'We (the
UN) are stretched,' he said, 'and many states are more willing to make
political commitments than assuring us of the means to fulfil these
mandates.'
Only Dollars 200m has so far been agreed for the operation, although Mr Hun
Sen, prime minister in the existing Cambodian government, is said to have
done a good job persuading US, Japanese and French officials of the
importance of Untac during a recent tour.
Aid is also available from multilateral organisations such as the Asian
Development Bank and from charities. But aid workers fear that a world
preoccupied with other crises, such as Yugoslavia, will forget Cambodia
after the elections. 'There is a danger that the west is going to suffer
Cambodia aid fatigue by then,' said an aid worker in Phnom Penh.
As if the funding of its own operations were not difficult enough, Untac is
being urged by Cambodians to finance the running costs of Mr Hun Sen's
lame-duck administration. Aid from the old east bloc countries dried up
nearly two years ago, leaving the government with few sources of finance
except the printing of new banknotes.
Financial shortages threaten the functioning of Mr Hun Sen's administration.
The pitiful salaries of civil servants and soldiers in the provinces  - a
medical worker at Kampot hospital receives about Dollars 5 a month plus
allowances for rice and paraffin  - are being paid about three months late,
and soldiers routinely hold up cars to extort cash.
Aid agencies are hoping that at least some foreign money can be spent on
maintaining basic administration, and the UN itself may be obliged to bear
some of the burden. Asked what sort of role Untac would play in the
government's finances, Mr Akashi said: 'It might be more extensive than we
would have liked. This country faces phenomenal difficulties in the area of
finance.'
No less substantial are concerns over security. The UN has successfully
brokered a fragile ceasefire between Khmer Rouge guerrillas and government
forces around the central town of Kompong Thom. But the Khmer Rouge has been
slow to fulfil its obligations under the peace accord and has continued to
refuse access to areas it controls along the country's borders with Thailand
and Laos.
More generally, UN officials expect that many Cambodians, accustomed to a
lifetime of warfare, will retain weapons in contravention of the peace
agreement, and that it will be difficult to reintegrate the demobilised
soldiers and guerrillas into society.
The biggest challenge will be to accommodate the Khmer Rouge. Although
included in the peace accord, western governments and most Cambodians are
anxious to ensure the guerrilla group is excluded from power. The Khmer
Rouge has tried to distance itself from its past and to promote a reformed
image through claims that it now supports democracy. At the same time, its
leaders appeal repeatedly to anti-Vietnamese sentiment.
But few voters are likely to support the Khmer Rouge in elections, and it is
assumed in Phnom Penh that the guerrilla group is biding its time in the
expectation that the next government will alienate the rural majority as
have previous Cambodian regimes.
Already there are ominous signs: Khmer Rouge officials are seeking
legitimacy by identifying themselves with the Supreme National Council (SNC)
 - which includes the four Cambodian factions and which is responsible,
along with the Untac, for implementing the peace plan. The group has also
sought to link itself with Prince Norodom Sihanouk, the country's
influential former leader.
The political situation throughout the country is unstable. Several
politicians and human rights activists have been assassinated in mysterious
circumstances, presumably on the orders of hardliners in Mr Hun Sen's
government, and there are doubts as to whether Prince Sihanouk himself,
chairman of the SNC, has the vision required to rebuild his country.
With so much working against the UN, its mission is having to feel its way
carefully. 'It's a country where the social and physical infrastructure has
been almost totally destroyed,' said Mr Akashi.
'We have no illusions that Cambodia will become an exemplary democracy at
the point where we leave, but at least we can lay the groundwork for
Cambodian democracy in the future.' If Untac does that, it will be a
remarkable achievement indeed.

FT  15 APR 92 / Leading Article: No soft option for the EBRD
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MODESTY has not been the hallmark of Mr Jacques Attali's reign as president
of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. For all Mr Attali's
high ambitions for the bank, its first year has been at best modestly
successful. Yet undaunted by the difficulties it faces in nurturing eastern
Europe's private sector, Mr Attali now wants the EBRD to take on the
daunting task of restructuring the ex-Soviet union's military-industrial
complex.
The EBRD has not yet proved it is anything more than an expensive political
gesture; but nor have its activities confirmed claims that it would be
either a diversion from or an obstacle to reform. Much of the last year has
been spent hiring staff and equipping offices. But the EBRD also had some
achievements to report to its first annual conference. It has approved about
20 projects, the first within three months of its launch, and committed some
Ecu 620m in lending, while sticking to its practice of accepting or
rejecting project proposals within 90 days.
Yet there has been rather more rejecting than accepting. Disappointingly,
the EBRD has so far been able to commit only a small fraction of the limited
capital at its disposal, and to dispense even less. It remains constrained
by the problem which threatened to plague it from the outset: it was
established to fill a niche which does not yet properly exist and for which
other private sector institutions may be better suited.
Investment catalyst
The EBRD was set up to be a catalyst for private sector investment. Its
statutes require the majority of its lending to go to the private sector on
commercial terms, at market interest rates and only if private sector
finance cannot do the job alone. So far there have been few suitable
projects, on a large enough scale to interest the EBRD, which meet these
criteria. Those that have arisen have been snapped up by private investors.
The EBRD, where it has been involved, has tended to be a minority partner
with large western multi-nationals, which is not quite what Mr Attali had in
mind.
It is not that private sector investment opportunities do not exist, given
the relatively high levels of education and low real wages in these
countries. But they tend to be small-scale, grass roots projects which
private banks find too risky. The EBRD was always going to be too remote to
fill that gap.
Little wonder then that the EBRD's president is trying to wriggle free of
the statutes and widen his bank's brief. Already the prohibition on lending
to the ex-Soviet republics has gone. Now Mr Attali wants to set up a special
restructuring facility which would make 'soft loans'  - that is at below
market interest rates  - to finance the conversion of the defence industries
to non-military production.
Short shrift
Predictably, the proposal has received short shrift from the bank's western
shareholders, particularly the US. Whether restructuring rather than
destroying the defence industries will speed and not impede the transition
is in itself debatable. If worthwhile, the World Bank is the only
institution with either the capacity or the expertise to assist the process.
Such a huge task is well beyond the scope of the Mr Attali's organisation.
Indeed, the west, including the EBRD, risks becoming obsessed with trying to
stabilise the ex-Soviet republics, which is a huge and long-term
undertaking, at the expense of helping the rest of eastern Europe. Mr
Attali's considerable skills as a lobbyist, as opposed to a banker, would be
better deployed in favour of improving access to western markets for Poland,
Hungary and Czechoslovakia, something on which the European Community
continues to drag its heels.
Before the EBRD can run, it must first learn to walk. It is the only
international institution with a specifically eastern European and private
sector mission. However limited in scope and difficult, the bank should
stick to it. Only when it has developed experience and credibility, and
eastern Europe has progressed further towards a market economy, will the
bank be able soundly to commit its capital. Until that task is achieved, it
should forget about bigger dreams.

FT  15 APR 92 / Leading Article: A patchwork of a cabinet
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
WITH THE junior ministerial appointments announced yesterday, Mr John
Major's government is complete. It has a few newcomers, notably Mr Jonathan
Aitken at defence and Mr Michael Mates at the Northern Ireland Office.
Although most of the faces are familiar the direction of Britain's affairs
is plainly under new management. This is the first administration since 1979
not to be constructed on foundations laid by Mrs Margaret Thatcher. Her
influence, which persisted after she left office, is finally set aside. The
full focus of public attention is now on the commanding presence of Mr
Major. Since last Thursday's convincing election victory, he is very much in
charge and the uncertainty that has characterised the government may be
replaced by a greater sureness of touch.
If the experience of the past 16 months is any guide the new cabinet's
business will be undertaken on collegiate lines. The prime minister has
taken particular care to carry his colleagues with him. Prior to the
election, he had little option if he was to maintain party unity. Yet there
is no reason to believe that his strategy of maintaining policy decisions
within a Tory consensus will be discontinued now that he is in a position to
reign supreme. He is supported by Mr Douglas Hurd, a superb foreign
secretary, and Mr Norman Lamont, a chancellor who has come through the fire.
Study in contrasts
That said, the pattern presented by his particular choices is a study in
contrasts. As chancellor, Mr Lamont will reassure the wing of the party that
is sceptical about the benefits of European monetary union; as secretary for
trade and industry, Mr Michael Heseltine will lead the charge of the
pro-Europeans. As chief secretary to the Treasury, Mr Michael Portillo will
have a reputation to enhance: his task will be to oversee an even more
difficult public spending round than usual. The new secretaries for
education and health, Mr John Patten and Mrs Virginia Bottomley, will expect
generous settlements. Mr Patten will have a powerful case to argue for more
money for education. Mrs Bottomley holds the prime minister's promise to
increase spending on the NHS in real terms.
Some of the appointments will remain intriguing, or puzzling, until the new
ministers have served a while. Mr Kenneth Clarke should be a strong home
secretary, able to tame the prison officers as he has the doctors and the
teachers before them, but we have to see him do it. Making Mr Peter Lilley
social security secretary could be merely to hide him away; alternatively Mr
Lilley could apply his sharp mind to further reforms, especially in the area
of pensions. He will need to temper his unsentimental economist's approach
with visible social concern.
Green credentials
Mr Michael Howard, the new environment secretary, is unquestionably on the
right of the party. It would be a disservice to democracy if he continued
the Thatcherite assault on local government. His green credentials have yet
to be established, as indeed have those of the government as a whole. Mr
Malcolm Rifkind is a clever minister whose plans for the privatisation of
British Rail went awry. The Department of Defence will test his abilities;
he will be required to display hitherto unrevealed strengths if he is to
resist the determined assaults of the defence lobbyists.
It cannot be said that the other appointments are all of a piece. Putting Mr
David Mellor in as secretary for the national heritage, which includes the
arts and broadcasting, is imaginative. To make Mr William Waldegrave
minister for the Citizen's Charter is curious. His record as health
secretary does not proclaim an ability to infuse the public with enthusiasm
for a novel idea. Mr John Mac-Gregor will have to draw on more than the
quiet doggedness he showed as education secretary if he is to disentangle BR
from public ownership. Mr Ian Lang will do best as Scottish secretary if he
can bridge the gap between the aspirations of the Scottish people and the
fears of the prime minister. It would be a mistake to adduce the marginal
increase in support in Scotland as a reason for refusing to rethink
devolution. Building a consensus government out of such a diverse cabinet
will test Mr Major's mettle.

FT  15 APR 92 / Banking on a little luck: The outlook for a Pounds 3.1bn
merger
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARTIN and SIMON HOLBERTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A century ago, the Hongkong and Shanghai Bank had a secret weapon: 'joss',
the pidgin English word for the protection of the local gods, the good luck
they bring. 'Truly joss take care this bank,' said a Shanghai businessman;
and one of its legendary early managers was known as 'Lucky' Jackson.
In announcing yesterday's Pounds 3.1bn bid for the UK's Midland Bank, its
boldest gamble yet, the Hongkong Bank has taken great care to minimise the
need for luck. It is making an all-paper offer, rather than the part-cash
bid that Midland's management asked for. It has pitched its offer at the
cautious end of the range. It has gone to great lengths to square as many of
the regulatory authorities as possible. Yet joss will still play a central
role in determining the takeover's fate.
Luck will be needed, first of all, in steering the bid to completion.
Stockbrokers' analysts were hoping for a higher price than the 378p a share
at which the bid values Midland. Shareholders were saying yesterday that
they had expected at least 400p, and that the bid would have to be raised.
Whether that is a realistic assessment depends on decisions at Lloyds Bank,
the most successful big UK bank of the past decade, which had made an
informal takeover approach to Midland before Hongkong Bank stepped in.
'Our view of a bid from another clearer,' said Mr Brian Pearse, Midland's
chief executive, yesterday, 'was that it was extremely unlikely that it
would have received the approval of the Monopolies and Mergers Commission.'
Even if it had, he said, the complementary factors were few, apart from the
possible cost savings from big redundancies. A combined Lloyds/Midland
'would have had even more of an emphasis on the UK' than at present.
Lloyds clearly has no fears of a UK concentration: it has based its recent
success on making money close to home. It is now mulling over what to do
next.
There are no other likely bidders, so if luck favours the Hongkong team and
Lloyds stays out of the bidding, the offer will be considered on its merits.
Midland's shareholders, who received only 4.53p per share in dividends last
year, will get 13.57p in dividends from their new shares in HSBC Holdings,
the Hongkong Bank's new London-based parent company, and another 11p
interest on the loan stock which makes up part of the offer. Investors will
have to balance that short-term gain against the possibility of a sharp rise
in post-tax earnings from an independent Midland Bank once the recession
ends.
One big shareholder, the Kuwait Investment Office, has been trying to sell
most of its 10 per cent holding of Midland shares, from the moment the terms
were announced  - an indication that it preferred cash today to the Hongkong
offer or to the possibility of a higher price from Lloyds.
If fortune favours its bid, the Hongkong Bank will still have to tackle the
task of running the merged operation. London will be the headquarters of the
holding company and the base for the senior executives who hold the main
functional responsibilities. Mr William Purves, HSBC's chairman and chief
executive, says that, in due course, 'there will be a group chairman and a
group chief executive, both with an overview of Hongkong Bank and Midland.
Both will be executives, with the chairman doing a lot of the
representational work, but the buck will stop with the chief executive, who
will reside in London.'
The group's individual banks  - in Hong Kong, the Midland in the UK, Marine
Midland in the US  - will retain their identities. But they will focus more
on retail business, leaving treasury management and technology to the
centre.
It is not clear how much influence the individual banks will have in
relationships with the group's 300 largest corporate customers. A central
team, described in the offer document as 'an enhanced International
Corporate Accounts capability', will keep a close eye on big customers.
Midland's big-time corporate bankers may find themselves reined-in.
The Hongkong team is confident it can run the merged group. 'We've been in
international banking for 130 years,' says Mr John Gray, deputy chairman of
HSBC Holdings. But he goes on: 'I would like to think we've learned our
lessons' from previous overseas problems in the US and in Australia.
Mr Purves, who will move to London to chair the combined group, makes a
similar point: 'I think I can be criticised for not making management
changes in Australia, UK and the US soon enough,' he said recently. The new
group management clearly intends to keep a close hold on its subsidiaries  -
but with important businesses on three continents, its inbred management
culture will be stretched to the limit.
If the Hongkong bid succeeds, and the management challenge is successfully
met, there is still a third need for luck. The merged bank will be very big,
and very strongly capitalised. It will rank, say the Hongkong people, in the
world's top 10 by size, and will be the second biggest outside Japan. More
importantly, perhaps, now that HSBC has revealed its Pounds 1bn of hidden
reserves, the merged bank will handsomely meet the Basle ratios for capital
adequacy, due to take effect at the end of this year. It will have 'tier 1'
capital (shareholders' funds) of 5.9 per cent of assets, nearly half as high
again as the Basle minimum of 4 per cent; and it will have total capital
equal to 10.9 per cent of assets, compared with Basle's 8 per cent minimum.
The takeover itself will cost money: HSBC will be making a provision of
Pounds 190m for the takeover and Pounds 200m to take account of the change
in HSBC's tax status in the UK. Mr Purves promised yesterday that the
synergies from the deal would outweigh these one-off costs. Potential areas
for synergy include trade finance, where Hongkong Bank believes it has much
to teach Midland; technology, where Mr Purves believes Hongkong Bank is a
world leader; treasury, where there are potential savings from merging the
two banks' operations; and investment banking, to be run as a global
business with shared back offices behind the separate identities of Samuel
Montagu, James Capel, Trinkaus &amp; Burkhardt, Euromobiliare and Wardley.
So far, so good. But another way of looking at the combined bank is to
assess the quality of its core businesses. On that basis, fortune is badly
needed. There is one enormously strong business, and a clutch of weaker
ones. The strong business is banking in Hong Kong, which generated pre-tax
profits for HSBC of Pounds 761m last year, 86 per cent of the total. Yet
uncertainties will hang over the Hong Kong business until the colony has
survived its transition to Chinese rule.
By comparison with Hong Kong, the other businesses are much less impressive
 - even the Pounds 117m earned in the rest of the Asia-Pacific region, or
the Pounds 73m in the Middle East and India. There were losses in the
Americas and in continental Europe. Midland Bank made only a Pounds 36m
profit before tax.
In the US, Marine Midland was back in profit in the first quarter and, in
the UK, Mr Pearse is optimistic about Midland's underlying trading. These
remain, however, weak banks in fiercely competitive markets. In time, with
hard work and careful decision-making, they can probably be rebuilt. But a
little joss would help.

FT  15 APR 92 / Arts: Musical life in Prague
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW CLARK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
What used to be forbidden is now de rigueur. What was available before has
lost much of its value. It has been a classic case of over-reaction. Never
mind the quality, Prague is gorging itself on musical freedom after 40 years
of rigid Communist control. Money and experience may be lacking in the new
era of market-led culture, but there is no shortage of activity and
enthusiasm.
Before the revolution, there were two concert agencies. Now there are 65.
Three years ago, Prague had an average monthly total of 90 concerts. Now
there are 240. Five societies for contemporary music have sprung up.
Just like the stall-owners hawking their wares on Wenceslas Square, the
music market has become overcrowded. Sooner or later the market will decide
who survives. But for the time being, now the initial shock of freedom has
passed, everyone is joining in the free-for-all, an indiscriminate scramble
for audiences, publicity, money, kudos, status. The old imposed rules are
gone, along with huge state subsidies. Self-help is the order of the day.
Particularly striking is the way western Europe has become the unchallenged
role-model. The Prague Spring Festival, formerly a showcase for East
European state culture, is this year dominated by high-earning western
artists.
The Smetana Theatre, newly divorced from the monolithic National Theatre,
has virtually wiped Czech works from the repertory and renamed itself the
Prague State Opera. It has held its first opera ball, now advertises
performances with a yellow airship-balloon, and has ventured into the
high-risk business of gala performances. The assumption is that it can sell
out Tosca with Mara Zampieri and Neil Shicoff at some 15 times normal seat
prices  - all a far cry from the days when the red star hung above the
proscenium.
In an atmosphere of public acrimony, the Czech Philharmonic Orchestra has
removed Jiri Belohlavek as chief conductor and elected a German, Gerd
Albrecht, in his place  - the first non-Czech to hold the post. It could
turn out to be an expensive mistake, for the orchestra's home-grown Czech
tradition was always its unique selling-point for foreign tour promoters and
record companies.
Even in Prague, the orchestra has discovered the downside to its new
autonomy: the renovation of its historic home, the Rudolfinum (due to be
re-opened on May 14), has cost three times more than estimated.
What no-one expected was that Prague should prove so immediately attractive
for foreign musicians. Little-known western conductors and stage directors
are accepting low pay in return for valuable experience. Several Georgian
and Ukrainian artists fleeing from poverty and instability in the former
Soviet empire have also picked up contracts, often with higher salaries but
no greater talent than their Czech colleagues.
There are plenty of other anomalies. Supraphon, the state recording company,
has produced 20 CD issues in the past three years  - but they have made
little or no impact in Prague shops, because Supraphon's local distribution
network has disappeared. The Prague Symphony Orchestra, overshadowed by the
Czech Philharmonic for most of its 60-year history, has begun to cut a more
confident profile at home and abroad  - but salaries are still only
two-thirds of the senior orchestra. 'People here don't earn a lot, but they
have faith in the future,' says the orchestra manager, Roman Belor. 'We
believe Prague is the hidden treasure of Europe.'
So, despite inflationary pressures and uncertainty over privatisation, the
underlying atmosphere is positive. Czech emigres such as the conductor
Martin Turnovsky have found a new lease of life, using hard-won experience
from 20 years' exile for the benefit of Prague's music institutions. The
main orchestras have given overdue recognition to composers such as Jan
Klusak and Petr Eben, whose careers had fallen foul of Communism.
The two leading opera companies have proved adept at tapping the pockets of
foreign visitors, thanks to improved marketing and a conversion to
original-language performance. The quality of singing and staging still
leaves much to be desired  - but after a period of administrative chaos,
operatic life is booming.
The latest crop of productions offers a mirror of Prague's current artistic
health. The particular attraction of the Zemlinsky double-bill at the State
Opera is its link with the past: it was performed in the same building
(Prague's former German theatre) where Zemlinsky spent 16 fruitful years as
music director before and after the First World War.
His one-act operas Eine florentinische Tragodie and Der Geburtstag der
Infantin are typical of the exotic repertory preferred by the State Opera's
dynamic young director, Karel Drgac, whose staging was both honest and
unpretentious.
In the first work, a tale of medieval blood-lust, the claustrophobia of the
Mediterranean night air was particularly well realised. The conductor Hilary
Griffiths ensured that the rich Straussian orchestra was heard to stupendous
effect  - so much so that it drowned the three singers.
The other work  - Zemlinsky's portrait of a heartless princess and a
heart-broken dwarf  - packs a much stronger punch, and offers plum parts to
its principal soprano and tenor, impressively sung by Zora Jehlickova and
Peter Svensson.
Otello was an equally ambitious undertaking but much less successful. The
staging by the Swiss director Dominik Neuner was arty and artificial, and
the cast (including the black American tenor Moises Parker and a Ukrainian
soprano, Tereza Slupska) were left in a dramatic vacuum. Only the Iago  -
the Czech baritone Ivan Kusnjer  - was a proper match for his part. The
performance was saved by the conducting of Martin Turnovsky, who inspired
the orchestra to rare heights of flexibility, precision and dynamic shading.
Orchestra and conductor were also the saving grace of the National Theatre's
new production of La boheme. Oliver von Dohnanyi, who has recently made some
well-noticed visits to Britain, supervised a brisk, shapely account, full of
verve, catching all the climaxes on the cusp. The cast worked like an
ensemble, their well-characterised spontaneity partly compensating for a
crass production by the German stage director Franz Winter. Helena Kaupova's
matronly Mimi had the best voice of the evening. The most exciting stage
personality was Natalja Melnik, who turned Musetta into a sexy man-eater in
black suspenders.

FT  15 APR 92 / Arts: Caviare to the general - Television
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER DUNKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is as much a waste of time to complain about the general vulgarity of
television as to object to the average height of the population. Once you
involve the profit motive (or, as Ben Elton kept saying on election night,
the 'profit motif', unless it was 'Prophet Mo Teef') it is inevitable that a
mass medium such as television will seek to maximise its audience.
Experience suggests that this may be true even without the profit motive:
the BBC has long felt the need to get big ratings some of the time in order
to sustain its claim on the licence fee. The important consideration for the
more demanding viewer is, what proportion of the output is vulgar nonsense,
and, as television continues to expand, the extent to which bad is driving
out good.
For newspaper commentators to condemn programmes such as It's Bizarre] is
hypocritical and pointless. Hypocritical because this new Saturday night
'infotainment' series on parts of the ITV network is remarkably similar in
subject and tone to much of the popular press. True, Tit Bits and Weekend
which relied on a similar collection of 'just fancy that' stories, no longer
exist. But many of the items in the opening edition would have sat quite
unremarkably in the pages of The Sun or Sunday People and, I suspect, in
several instances have already done so. The woman 'married' to identical
twins, the 'wolf boys', and the sex therapist who rented Norman Lamont's
house, all seemed distinctly familiar, though the Welshman who eats live
worms was certainly, er, novel.
Co-presenter Linda Lusardi first came to public attention on Page 3 of The
Sun where, of course, very large parts of her were on display. It might be
argued that covering up her main assets before putting her on television was
counter-productive, but presumably most people would regard her television
appearance as less 'vulgar' than her newspaper appearance. Furthermore, in
any contest for the sleaziest, not to say most ridiculous, excesses of the
mass media, print would still beat television hands down. No broadcaster has
yet come up with anything to compete with the US's National Enquirer or
Britain's own Sunday Sport.
There is even one instance at present where it could be argued that the
bringing of vulgarity to the screen is something of a triumph. Benny Hill,
having been banished thanks to the undue influence of a few feminists and
right-on alternative comedians in the silliest example yet of 'political
correctness' in British broadcasting, has been quietly reinstated on Tuesday
evenings at peak time. Having banned Hill's shows from British screens, the
people at ITV must have felt rather silly when commentators such as Anthony
Burgess, John Mortimer and Michael Bentine began praising him as a classic
clown, and newspapers revealed to the British public that the shows, sold of
course by ITV, were being screened with extraordinary success in 100
countries overseas, including the US.
As it happens, I find Hill's screen persona embarrassingly ingratiating and
would not normally choose to watch him, but there is surely no more sense in
campaigning against the vulgarity of his shows than in campaigning against
the vulgarity of hamburgers. 'Vulgar' comes from 'vulgus', Latin for 'the
great multitude of the people', and all it really implies is that something
is popular. If the world is full of people who actually prefer hamburgers to
whitebait or oxtail, never mind pate de foie gras, it scarcely seems worth
wasting breath in trying to convert them; we must just kick aside the
hamburger cartons as we walk to the wet fish shop and the family butcher.
However, the time when we are surely entitled to start shouting is when the
hamburger joints start putting the fish shops and butchers out of business.
In television terms that means the time when, despite the growing number of
channels and the increasing number of hours, it begins to look as though the
number of high quality programmes is going down (although it should be going
up if the proportions were being maintained) and vulgarity is creeping in
even to places where it was once notably absent.
Previously the BBC's Young Musician Of The Year contest was one of the most
heartening events in the calendar, offering a showcase for talent and
providing several programmes of unadulterated music. Humphrey Burton  -
enthusiastic, knowledgeable, and highly professional  - was the presenter,
and his brief interviews gave us a bit of background on the competitors.
Burton did present the final this year, but the heats had been changed. They
were presented by a young woman with a strong regional accent and a young
black man with an exotic hairstyle, all of which would be unremarkable
provided they had proved with their knowledge and professionalism that they
had been selected as the best at the job and not for being politically
correct. Unfortunately there was little sign of this. Worse, no sooner had
one of the competitors started performing than the picture faded away, the
music became 'background', and we found ourselves watching a contestant
riding her horse or wandering along a canal gossiping about his hobbies. A
unique series of occasions for music lovers had been turned into another set
of chat shows.
Why? Television is overloaded with shows which combine casual chat and
musical interludes. In addition to six lots of Jonathan Ross and two lots of
Wogan every week, we get Cilla Black's Surprise Surprise, Phillip Schofield
with Television's Greatest Hits (which turns out to be a chat'n'clip show)
and of course Aspel And Company which, this week, contained one of the
stickiest confrontations in living memory. Aspel's questions were mostly
longer than Cher's answers, of which one of the more informative was 'I
don't know'. Friday saw the start of yet another music and chat series:
Bruce's Guest Night on BBC1, in which Bruce Forsyth clowns and sings with
pop stars and sportsmen.
If that is what people want, let them have it, but why did Channel 4's
programme on Sunday called Sue Farrow Plays Mozart have to go down the same
road? No doubt you have to trick out a lot of modern pop music with laser
shows and funny clothing since viewers would not stay tuned for the music on
its own, but Mozart's Symphony No 40 is a very different kettle of fish.
With the orchestra in white tie, it is ludicrous to bring on a conductor
with a crew cut, black leather trousers, black leather waistcoat and open
necked shirt. . . particularly when the conductor happens to be a woman. To
surround her in a cone of laser beams, bathe the musicians in pink or orange
light, and then insert more than 50 edits in the space of 60 seconds is
plain daft: nobody could watch that sort of frenzy and properly appreciate
the music.
Up to now, the familiar British middle-class attitude of superciliousness
towards television as a whole has been as nonsensical as a similar attitude
towards the whole of print or food. Most of the material in all these
spheres has always been aimed at mass taste. But, as the appalling Thatcher
Broadcasting Act begins to have its effect, we had better watch more
carefully than ever to see what is happening to that proportion of
television which used to have higher ambitions because, if we are not
careful, we may indeed end up with nothing but the vulgar.

FT  15 APR 92 / City businesses tighten security to combat IRA
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY, BETHAN HUTTON, ANDREW JACK, RICHARD LAPPER and CATHERINE
MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CITY BUSINESSES have been tightening security and emergency planning
arrangements following the threat of renewed terrorist action from the IRA.
Mr Ian Johnson, managing director of IJA Group, a risk and security
management consultancy, said his company was one of several which had
received calls from existing and potential clients following the explosion
of the bomb in the City last Friday evening.
He said that in the short term many companies were employing extra guards to
raise the visibility of security, partly as a deterrent and partly to
restore staff confidence.
Mr Johnson said: 'It happened after the firebombs at Christmas, and with the
Easter holiday coming up companies are ensuring they are as secure as
possible. The bomb has concentrated senior managers' minds on disaster
planning.'
Security guards outside the City office complex which houses Chase
Manhattan, the US investment bank, and Slaughter &amp; May, the solicitors, were
at work yesterday noting the number plates of cars parked outside.
Mr Owen Kelly, City of London police commissioner, appealed to companies
yesterday which had security cameras or closed circuit televisions to ensure
they were in good working order.
Most businesses are reluctant to discuss security arrangements in any
detail. National Westminster Bank revealed that it had special anti-shatter
film on the windows in its tower before the blast last week.
'It worked very well in the circumstances on Friday,' a spokesman said.
'Most of the panes just fractured, but stayed in place, which lessened the
damage and prevented glass blowing in or falling out on to the street.'
Touche Ross, the accountancy firm, said it had pre-empted Friday's bombing
by chance, and was already planning to adopt tighter security measures.
These involve all members of staff having to show a security pass to get
into the building, and visitors being issued with passes only after being
positively identified by a member of staff. Video cameras protect the
entrances, and guards also carry out patrols.
Wine bars are also paying more attention to security. Balls Brothers, a
chain with a dozen branches around the City, has not given staff specific
advice but the manager of one branch said he was 'very vigilant about left
parcels and briefcases'. Posters warning customers to keep their belongings
to hand in case of theft help keep down the number of false alarms.
The exposure of the UK's leading insurers to loss from the bomb damage will
be limited to possibly less than Pounds 150m, it emerged yesterday.
The bulk of the loss  - which with claims from both property damage and
business interruption could amount to up to Pounds 1bn  - will be met by
reinsurers in London and overseas.

FT  15 APR 92 / North's economy may be reviving
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SALES, employment and profits fell in the first quarter of the year among
companies in the north of England. Optimism about prospects for the year
ahead increased, however, according to the latest Business Survey North,
published yesterday.
Mr John Bridge, chief executive of the Northern Development Company, said
the findings suggested that the north's economy could be approaching a
'turning point'.
The report, based on responses from 1,017 companies in north-east England
and Cumbria, shows exports in the first quarter at their lowest level since
the quarterly surveys began at the start of last year. Company profits
dropped sharply, showing their first negative balance for a year.
But the survey, carried out by the NDC and the Tyne and Wear and Teesside
chambers of commerce, records increased investment in plant, machinery and
buildings, a rise in expenditure on training and a marginal improvement in
domestic and export orders.
Business confidence, which slumped in the final quarter of last year, has
rallied although it is still below its 1991 third-quarter level. In the
latest survey 28.6 per cent of companies predicted an improvement in the
April to July period and 17.3 per cent a deterioration, compared with 16 per
cent and 27.9 per cent respectively last time.
Overall the service sector outperformed manufacturing in the latest quarter
and was more optimistic.
In manufacturing large companies did better than small ones; in the service
sector it was the reverse.
Nearly a third of manufacturers cut their workforce, yet more than a third
of those which recruited had problems hiring skilled manual workers.
The proportion of companies working at more than 90 per cent capacity
increased slightly to 21.1 per cent.
The NDC funded the latest survey.

FT  15 APR 92 / Unions accuse BBC of risking 10,000 jobs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BROADCASTING unions yesterday accused the BBC of imposing a 'double whammy'
on its staff, which could cost up to 10,000 jobs by 1996.
Mr Tony Lennon, joint president of Bectu, the Broadcasting Entertainment
Cinematograph and Theatre Union, predicted that this would be the scale of
losses arising from internal recommendations about the future of the
corporation and the move towards buying services in the open market.
Bectu yesterday distributed the confidential summary conclusions of the 15
BBC task forces examining the corporation's role.
Proposals include increasing use of independent producers, closing Radio 5
in its present form, floating BBC Education as a private limited company and
closing BBC World Service TV unless it becomes self-financing by March 1994.
None of the recommendations are BBC policy. The board of management and the
governors will begin discussing the proposals next month.
As Bectu distributed copies of the documents, the union began ballotting its
14,000 BBC members for a day of industrial action on May 15 to express lack
of confidence in the BBC management.
One task force document  - The BBC: The Standard Setter  - is severely
critical of the corporation's decision making. It looked at a range of BBC
decisions, such as those on starting Daytime TV and creating Radio 5.
Defence and expansion of territory had been the most potent motivation in
Daytime TV, it said. With Radio 5, structural changes had been made to solve
editorial problems.
'The decision-making process would fall short of high public-service
standards on the grounds that not enough neutral, well-researched
information on crucial questions was fed into the decisions,' the report
says.
Another  - The Mission  - admitted that Channel 4 had ended the BBC's
monopoly of culturally adventurous programme making, that ITV was
outperforming the BBC in popular drama, and that between 1987 and 1991 there
had been no BBC dramatisations of classic literary works.
At a press conference yesterday Mr Lennon said the move to the outside
market was costing the corporation money.
Earlier this year the BBC had sold 60 years of stock scenery items for
Pounds 75,000. The purchaser charged the BBC Pounds 1,100 for the hire of
just three of the items for two days.
Bectu fears that the structure and programme capacity of the BBC could be
seriously weakened before the new national heritage department under Mr
David Mellor has a chance to look at the future role and financing of the
BBC.
Sir Michael Checkland, director-general of the corporation, has already made
it clear he will reject some of the task force recommendations such as the
privatisation of BBC orchestras and levels of contracting out.

NATIONAL Westminster Bank yesterday announced plans to spend Pounds 80m on
redeveloping a 1.25 acre site beside the Bank of England in the City,
Vanessa Houlder writes.
The bank intends to construct three office buildings totalling 230,000 sq
ft, 22 shops, a restaurant and a wine bar on the triangular site which spans
40 to 53 Threadneedle Street and 1 to 18 Old Broad Street.
The site, which at present contains 10 buildings, six of which are listed,
is in the Bank Conservation Area covering the financial and commercial core
of the City. NatWest intends to keep the majority of the elevations and to
restore two of the banking halls. It plans to construct a building in the
form of a rotunda at 1 Old Broad Street.

FT  15 APR 92 / Channel 5 winner will have to retune VCRs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Independent Television Commission confirmed yesterday that the
successful applicant for the Channel 5 franchise will have to carry out the
retuning of several million video recorders. Estimates for the retuning cost
have ranged from Pounds 50m to Pounds 200m.
In advertising the franchise the ITC warned it might not award a licence at
all unless the work could be done efficiently.
The new television channel will be able to reach 74 per cent of the
population but about 3m video recorders would suffer serious interference
because they are tuned to frequencies to be used by Channel 5.
Applicants for the franchise are expected to include Mr Silvio Berlusconi,
the Italian television entrepreneur, and Five TV, a consortium which
includes Mr Moses Znaimer, founder of City TV in Toronto.
Mr Oliver Novick, vice-president for corporate development at Mr
Berlusconi's Fininvest, said yesterday the ITC announcement 'means we can
now get down to the business of developing detailed and comprehensive
plans'.
The winner of the franchise will have to pay for most of the retuning.
Bidders have to include a detailed plan on how they propose to retune or
modify the 15 per cent to 20 per cent of VCRs and the 10 per cent of
satellite receivers expected to face interference.
The plans will be published for comment and will be taken into account in
deciding whether the ITC believes a bidder will be able to maintain a
service throughout the 10-year period of the licence.
Mr George Russell, chairman of the ITC, has described retuning as 'at best a
headache, at worst a nightmare'.
Mr David Glencross, chief executive of the ITC, said he was optimistic the
problem could be solved. If the commission was not satisfied 'it will feel
it is justified in not awarding the licence'.
The ITC has prepared a code of practice which specifies that retuning should
be done within 21 days of a request being made or interference beginning,
whichever is later.
The winner of the competitive tender for the new channel will also face
growing competition from cable and satellite television.
Mr Glencross said yesterday: 'We are not guaranteeing that we will award it
(the licence). We are not guaranteeing that if it is awarded it will be a
commercial success. It is a commercial risk.'
The new channel must start by January 1 1995 and should cover no less than
30 per cent of the population from the outset. The full 74 per cent coverage
has to be reached within six years of launch. It must begin with at least 30
per cent original programming.
News, current affairs, childrens' and religious programmes are mandatory.
Six further programme types are listed such as documentaries, adult
education, drama and arts. A bidder deciding not to show such programme
types has to explain how it can meet the government's stipulation that
Channel 5 offer high-quality programmes catering to a wide variety of tastes
and interests.
Mr Glencross emphasised that nothing in the 1990 Broadcasting Act specified
that Channel 5 should be located outside London, and the ITC was not allowed
to discriminate in favour of an applicant offering local television services
as opposed to a single national channel.
Channel 5 could, however, be a subscription service rather than one funded
by advertising.

FT  15 APR 92 / Scottish companies seek telecom licences
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE TWO Scottish electricity companies have become the first UK electricity
companies to apply for licences to enter the telecommunications market and
compete with BT and Mercury.
Yesterday ScottishPower said it intended to begin by providing leased
circuits for business customers, but would eventually offer
telecommunications services to residential users. It has applied to the
Department of Trade and Industry for a licence.
It emerged yesterday that Scottish Hydro-Electric, which operates in
northern Scotland, made an application a few weeks ago. No other electricity
utility appears on the latest register of companies applying for
telecommunications licences maintained by Oftel, the industry regulator, but
others are expected to apply.
Last year the government opened the UK telecommunications market to
competition, encouraging utilities and other companies to apply for
licences.
ScottishPower, like other electricity companies, already has a large
telecommunications network using packet switching and digital-data
transmission between power stations and control rooms.
It also has access to customers' premises through its electricity supply
cables. The ducts through which these cables run can carry optical-fibre
telecommunications cables without suffering electrical interference.
ScottishPower intends to expand its telecommunications network and connect
it to the premises of companies which wish to use its service. It will
initially offer companies leased circuits for internal communications
between sites.
Mr Hugh Wilson, ScottishPower's telecommunications business manager who
recently joined the company from BT, said it hoped to expand across the UK
and overseas through links with other utilities. He said ScottishPower had
already had discussions with other regional electricity companies.
He would not say how much ScottishPower intended to invest in its
telecommunications venture, but acknowledged that it would take hundreds of
millions of pounds over a long period to make an impact.
Hydro-Electric said it had applied for a licence within the last month but
did not wish to comment further. For either company to offer a comprehensive
service in Scotland would require them to co-operate and use the
telecommunications links which already exist between them.
PowerGen said it was not applying for a licence because, unlike the regional
electricity companies and integrated utilities, it did not have connections
to customers' premises.
So far seven telecommunications companies have been granted licences by the
DTI to operate services.

FT  15 APR 92 / Court advocacy changes endorsed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE, Legal Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE END of the Bar's 200-year monopoly on advocacy in the higher courts in
England and Wales came a step closer yesterday as the committee set up to
advise the Lord Chancellor endorsed wider advocacy rights for solicitors.
Solicitors in private practice, qualified for three years, who can show
experience of advocacy in the lower courts and who are prepared to attend a
training course and pass tests on evidence and procedure, will be allowed to
present cases in the higher courts.
But the Lord Chancellor's Advisory Committee, established under the 1990
Courts and Legal Services Act, rejected applications for wider advocacy
rights for employed solicitors and barristers in the Crown Prosecution
Service, the Government Legal Service, local authorities and in commerce,
finance and industry.
Lord Griffiths, the law lord who chairs the committee, said advocates in the
higher courts had to be able to show detachment and impartiality and to
appear often enough in such courts to maintain their competence.
The committee felt employed lawyers were unlikely to meet either criterion
and said there was also no demand for lawyers in commerce and industry to
have wider advocacy rights.
It had also concluded that giving the CPS wider rights of audience would
build up a 'monolithic prosecution service' leading to polarisation of
attitudes between prosecution and defence as in the US.
Lord Griffiths said there was some attraction in a mixed system with
independent advocates prosecuting most crown court cases with the option for
the CPS to prosecute a limited number of less serious cases. But the CPS had
not overcome its problems of underfunding and a lack of skilled personnel.
The Law Society welcomed the extension of rights for the practising
profession, but was dismayed by the proposal to discriminate against
employed solicitors. The CPS and the Government Legal Service, in a joint
statement, also expressed concern that the committee had differentiated
between certain groups of equally qualified lawyers.
The Bar, which has been fighting a rearguard action to keep its monopoly,
yesterday criticised the committee for 'two profound failures'.
Mr Gareth Williams QC, Bar chairman, said the committee had failed to
understand the public importance of the Bar's 'cab-rank' rule - which
prevents barristers from refusing to act for clients - and had not imposed
any obligation on solicitors to do legal aid work. He also criticised the
minimal extra training solicitors would have to undergo to get wider
advocacy rights.

FT  15 APR 92 / Isle of Man to run budget deficit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SUE STUART
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Isle of Man plans a budget deficit for 1992-93.
Announcing its budget yesterday, the Manx government said an estimated
increase in receipts of 5.9 per cent over last year to Pounds 190m would be
countered by expected net spending of Pounds 194.5m. Last year the surplus
was Pounds 2.5m.
Mr Donald Gelling, Manx treasury minister, said: 'The island has ridden the
UK recession well but there is certainly not the growth we have had in
recent years.'
The government will not borrow to meet the deficit. It will bring funds
forward from last year and use interest on the Pounds 64.75m reserves and
the government's current account.
Mr Gelling announced capital spending of Pounds 48m for the coming year.
This includes spending on the island's airport, the health service's estate,
community accommodation for the mentally handicapped and a new
meat-processing plant.
Encouragement is given to the local business community by introduction of a
temporary 10 per cent rebate on employers' National Insurance contributions,
to be reviewed after a year. The island will not introduce National
Insurance contributions on the benefit of cars and fuel.
Company fees are to be increased by 16 per cent, but the maximum fee for
company registration is cut from Pounds 50,000 to Pounds 5,000 to attract
larger concerns to register in the island.
Income tax remains at 15 per cent on the first taxable Pounds 8,000 and 20
per cent thereafter for residents and 20 per cent on all taxable income for
non-residents and companies. Allowances will rise 6.2 per cent to Pounds
6,000 for a single person. The combined, fully transferable allowance for a
married couple will be Pounds 12,000.

FT  15 APR 92 / Boost for job prospects reported
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JOB prospects have been boosted by the Conservatives' general election
victory, according to a post - election survey by Manpower, one of the
country's largest providers of employment services, Lisa Wood writes.
The survey, which covered 349 companies from the 2,074 polled regularly each
quarter, showed greatest optimism in the service sector.
Before the election 16 per cent of service businesses in the private sector
planned job increases. This rose to 22 per cent after the election, while
those forecasting cuts fell from 17 per cent to 11 per cent.
In the service sector the greatest increase in confidence was in the
transport, retailing and energy and water industries. There was a smaller
increase in optimism in the manufacturing sector.
The number of employers forecasting cuts fell from 17 per cent to 14 per
cent. Those forecasting job creation remained at 16 per cent.

FT  15 APR 92 / Cautious response to manufacturing figures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FEBRUARY'S surprise jump in manufacturing output was greeted cautiously by
economists yesterday.
Although the seasonally adjusted 1.1 per cent monthly increase was the
biggest rise since March 1990, this set of data is notoriously erratic on a
monthly basis and Central Statistical Office statisticians prefer to look at
quarterly trends.
The rise also comes after January's extremely weak figures when
manufacturing output fell by 0.6 per cent.
Mr Gerard Lyons, chief economist at DKB International, said: 'I think there
could be a lot of misplaced optimism. High interest rates and debt overhang
still remain a problem.'
A breakdown of the production industries  - manufacturing plus energy and
water production  - shows that in the latest three months the only sector to
increase output was consumer goods. Here output rose by 0.8 per cent on the
previous three months, prompting some economists to suggest the recovery
would be consumer-led.
Output of the energy industries fell by 2 per cent. The CSO said this was
because February's weather was much milder than last year.
Production of plant and machinery suffered the heaviest year-on-year
decline, falling 6.6 per cent in the latest three months compared with the
same period a year ago. On the previous three months, sector output fell by
1.9 per cent.
Output of metals fell 1.3 per cent in the latest three months. Production of
chemicals, up 6.5 per cent on the year, fell by 0.7 per cent in the three
months.
The engineering sector suffered the heaviest annual decline among
manufacturing industries. Output fell 6.9 per cent compared with the same
three months a year ago. On the latest three months it fell by 1.1 per cent.
Within engineering, however, output of cars rose by 1.5 per cent. The CSO
suggested this was because carmakers reduced stocks during the winter which
they were now rebuilding.
There was a modest rise in output in the 'other manufacturing' component of
the data.

FT  15 APR 92 / British Airways sues Virgin
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH AIRWAYS is counter-suing its rival Virgin Atlantic, and its chairman
Mr Richard Branson, for libel over allegations that BA had used 'dirty
tricks' to win custom.
The move comes three weeks after Virgin began an action against BA for
alleged defamation. BA had asserted that the dirty tricks allegations were a
publicity stunt.
Explaining the decision to counter-sue, Mr Mervyn Walker, BA's legal
director, said: 'Virgin and Mr Branson have chosen to continue their
campaign against us by commencing legal proceedings. They have left us no
other choice.'
BA's decision followed within hours of Virgin's application for its case to
be listed for trial.
Mr Justice Drake said the listing should be on June 15, a decision which
each side claimed as a victory.
'Virgin failed in its application for a speedy trial,' said BA.
Virgin replied: 'That's not true. We applied for the earliest possible date
which was June 15.'
Both sides seem entrenched in their positions. BA is not prepared to
withdraw unless Virgin does so first. Virgin said that it needed an apology
and a recantation of alleged actions to damage Virgin.
It is understood that a trial would probably take place before the end of
July. BA said it would not apply for any postponement.
BA said yesterday that it had conducted an internal review to check whether
'some corner of the company' could be to blame for any orchestrated campaign
against Virgin. The review found nothing.
The company then decided to go ahead with the counter suit, which claims
that a letter dated December 11 last year, and circulated to some BA
directors and the press, was defamatory of BA.
'We have made it clear that those accusations are untrue,' said Mr Walker.
Talks between the two companies broke down in mid-March and have not
restarted.

FT  15 APR 92 / Teachers told to accept opt-outs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LEADER of one of the largest teaching unions conceded yesterday that
'opt-out' schools were 'here to stay' and had to be accepted by the
education establishment.
A rapid increase in the number of schools opting out of local authority
control lay at the heart of the Conservative election manifesto and will be
a high priority for Mr John Patten, the new education secretary.
Mr Peter Smith, general secretary of the AMMA, the second-largest teachers'
union, warned teachers not to 'Siberianise' themselves after the election.
They had to recognise that grant-maintained schools were likely to become
the norm, he said. 'They're here to stay, let's make them work,' he said at
AMMA's annual conference in Birmingham.
As yet only 213 of the 25,000 state schools in England and Wales have opted
out, with 80 seeking permission to do so.
Grant-maintained schools are funded from Whitehall and have discretion over
their budgets and recruitment subject to statutory and national curriculum
requirements.
The conference rejected moves to link pay to performance and urged that the
government's plan to shift 80 per cent of teacher training to schools be
delayed.

FT  15 APR 92 / Gould seeks to offer radical agenda: The race to lead Labour
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT IS a measure of the task facing Mr Bryan Gould that his candidacy for the
Labour leadership is being championed in terms of the need for a frank
post-election debate on what direction the party should take.
Mr Gould is a thoughtful man who campaigns effectively and has the knack of
getting on with people.
He can claim to have leadership qualities. But instead his candidacy is
being presented as a means to an end, so as not to be seen as a spoiler
prepared to sacrifice party unity on the altar of personal ambition.
If he is to upset the already formidable Smith bandwagon, Mr Gould will have
to demonstrate that he has a cogent and distinctive view of what the future
should hold.
This may be easier said than done, not because the shadow environment
secretary lacks vision but because the traditional categories of left versus
right are of limited value in delineating how his and the shadow
chancellor's views differ.
A more fruitful tack, as Mr Gould's supporters may find, could be to portray
their New Zealand-born protege as the radical alternative to Mr Smith's
small 'c' conservatism.
This was the approach Mr Gould appeared to be groping towards yesterday when
he spoke of the need to 'move forward with a positive and radical agenda'.
A key aim of his campaign would be to convince party power brokers  - in the
words of one aide  - that 'reassuring people who defected in 1983 and 1987
is no longer the name of the game'. To triumph in 1996 the party would need
to do more than elect a safe pair of hands as leader.
Mr Gould's radical bow has several strings. On economics he has argued
strongly that a realignment of sterling within the exchange rate mechanism
is necessary.
Devaluation should be a once and for all step and could be accompanied by a
move to the mechanism's narrow band.
This stance is in tune with his notion of the 'proper purpose' of the
exchange rate being to 'allow the economy to grow at a reasonable rate'.
As a champion of the interests of industry against City short-termism, he
has never been slow to highlight the link between an over-valued currency
and poor manufacturing competitiveness.
On Europe he still has a reputation as a sceptic but his true position is
more complex and pragmatic, as he was anxious to point out yesterday.
Britain's position in the European Community should be accepted and
exploited, he argues.
Although an advocate of 'subsidiarity', or power being exercised at the
lowest possible level, he concedes there are areas of policy where a
Europe-wide mandate could be desirable and appropriate.
On Labour's internal reform he is a strong believer in one member, one vote.
He said yesterday that he would favour the phasing out of the union block
vote more rapidly than is currently timetabled.
Mr Gould is one of the staunchest remaining apologists of redistributive
taxation among senior party figures and sees a key role for employee share
ownership in achieving a more equal society.
On proportional representation, by contrast, he is almost as tortured as his
opponent, resorting to the formula that he has so far endorsed the Plant
Commission's recommendations. He yesterday advocated setting up a convention
to deal with important constitutional matters but he gave no inkling of
where his personal preferences lay.
Mr Gould may also be able to exploit his yuppie flair in so far as it
contrasts with Mr Smith's caution and dependability.

FT  15 APR 92 / Non-Cabinet appointments
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Richard Needham
THE NEW trade and industry minister, is a chirpy and interventionist Tory
likely to fit comfortably in a department headed by Mr Michael Heseltine. In
his previous job as Northern Ireland's economy minister, Mr Needham believed
in taking a pro-active role in encouraging investment. Aged 50, he holds the
record for continuous service at the Northern Ireland Office  - a testimony
as much to the unease with which he fitted into Mrs Margaret Thatcher's
government as to his dedication to Ulster.
At times he survived only by luck. His biggest claim to fame came after
terrorists intercepted a telephone conversation about Mrs Margaret Thatcher
in which he wished 'the silly cow would resign'. A few months later she did.
Mr Needham is witty, sometimes a show off and frequently a tease, annoying
his staff by running behind schedule. He can be over-sensitive and unable to
summon sufficient political brutality to push ideas through into practice.
He succeeded in uniting nationalist and Unionist politicians in Northern
Ireland against his plans for privatising the province's electricity
industry.
Anthony Nelson
MR NELSON, who has been appointed economic secretary to the Treasury, used
his detailed knowledge of the working of the City to press for the more
effective regulation of the financial services sector during the passage of
the legislation which established the Securities and Investments Board.
Mr Nelson, MP for Chichester since October 1974, led the final stage of the
campaign for televising the Commons.
A frequent participant in finance bill debates and a staunch advocate of
Britain's membership of the European Community, Mr Nelson will bring panache
and style to the Treasury team.
He was a merchant banker with NM Rothschild before entering the Commons and
was one of Mrs Virginia Bottomley's 'political minders' when she won the
South West Surrey by-election in 1984.
Mr Nelson was one of the backbenchers who successfully pressed Mr Norman
Lamont, the chancellor, to take action in his pre-election budget to freeze
the transitional element in the uniform business rate by ensuring that the
increase in 1992-93 did not exceed the rate of inflation.
Stephen Dorrell
THE incoming financial secretary to the Treasury, who steps up from junior
health minister, was secretary of the Conservative backbench Treasury
committee from 1980 to 1982.
He became identified with the 'wet' wing of the Conservative party at the
age of 22 when acting as personal assistant to Mr Peter Walker in the
general election held in February 1974. After capturing Loughborough to
become the youngest member of the Commons in 1979, Mr Dorrell served as
secretary to the Conservative backbench trade and industry committee before
becoming a parliamentary private secretary and serving in the whips office.
Mr Dorrell demonstrated combative qualities when appointed junior health
minister in 1990. He championed the NHS reforms, and his robust denials of
Labour's claims that the NHS was being privatised impressed senior
colleagues.
Early associations with 'one nation' Toryism handicapped Mr Dorrell during
the Thatcher years when he was described as 'excessively moderate' by Mr
Julian Critchley, the sage of the Tory backbenches. In Major's era his
political roots should prove a developing asset.
Sir John Cope
SIR JOHN has earned his reward for his time spent overseeing Tory party
finances with his appointment as Treasury minister.
The former deputy chairman of the Conservative party is a popular, genial
MP, specialising in small behind-the-scenes triumphs. Although Central
Office does not publish its detailed accounts, Sir John appears to have gone
some way towards reversing the fall-off in donations to the Conservative
party.
Aged 54, Sir John is an unassuming figure likely to suit an important, but
relatively low-profile, job. He does not have political panache, an
excessive appetite for publicity, or the clout of a heavyweight. But he has
a warmth and intelligence that makes him able to work effectively as part of
a team.
He also has business acumen from a background as a chartered accountant and
past company directorships. In his political life he has paid particular
interest to the needs of small businesses.
His past incarnations include a respected tenure as deputy chief whip and a
less impressive period as Northern Ireland security minister. He has also
been an employment minister.
Tim Eggar
IT IS an indication of how obscure Mr Tim Eggar's progress through the
ministerial ranks to his new appointment at the Department of Trade and
Industry that he is perhaps best known for an altercation, more than two
years ago, after he caught a six-year-old girl taking flowers from his
garden.
That incident led to the girl's father being convicted of assaulting Mr
Eggar, but the judge also criticised the then employment minister's
behaviour.
While this incident may have reinforced his pugnacious reputation, he is
also tough and determined. Having been selected as prospective parliamentary
candidate for Enfield North at the age of 23 in October 1975, he spent three
nights a week and most weekends there for the next three years,
familiarising himself with constituents' concerns.
In July, he will complete three years as a minister, first at employment,
then at education under Mr Kenneth Clarke, now at Mr Michael Heseltine's
DTI.
An advocate of privatisation throughout the 1980s, he has been credited with
engineering the change in Tory thinking in favour of vocational education.
Jonathan Aitken
Although a deeply ingrained Euro-sceptic, Mr Jonathan Aitken,the new
minister of state for defence, made a timely decision not to vote against
thegovernment in the most recent division in the Commons on the European
Community Budget.
He also lavished praise on Mr John Major,the prime minister, for his defence
of British interests when negotiating the Maastricht treaty.
Fittingly, after 18 years on the Tory backbenches, Mr Aitken, a Beaverbrook
scion, has reached the front bench by skipping the lowest rung on the
ladder.
As a journalist he campaigned against the Official Secrets Act and was
cleared of breaching it at the Old Bailey.
Mr Aitken has a trenchant debating style, which he demonstrated when
likening the private legislation authorising self-regulation for the Lloyd's
insurance market to 'cleaning the Augean stables with a toothbrush'.
The MP for Thanet South, he championed his constituents' interests and
maintained a Euro-sceptic stance when voting against the 'inadequate,
unfair, partisan and rushed' plans for the Channel tunnel.

FT  15 APR 92 / Smith cautious as he outlines his battle plan: The race to
lead Labour
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN SMITH was in characteristically circumspect mood as he launched his
bid yesterday for the Labour party leadership. The man who has built his
standing in the party  - and his popularity with the voters - on a
reputation for dispassionate sobriety was not about to break the habit of a
lifetime.
So instead of a brave new world, the shadow chancellor offered the serried
ranks of the press some cautious pointers to the direction in which he would
take the party.
Labour would be pro-European, realistic in its economic policy, relevant in
its social aspirations, and committed to constitutional reform. It would be
gradualist. He might almost have said conservative.
But the phrase that crept in most frequently when he was quizzed on the
details of his policies  - particularly towards the role of the trade unions
 - was that these were matters which required 'most careful consideration'.
It was an uncomfortable performance. He had the demeanour of a man who knows
he is going to win but is aware the manner of his victory could make for a
difficult future.
Denying that the trade union barons had 'stitched up' the succession to Mr
Neil Kinnock, he emphasised he wanted the widest possible debate among party
members, Westminster colleagues and affiliated trade unions before the
leadership contest.
He was happy to see the date of the contest put back to allow time for every
constituency party to ballot its membership and for affiliated organisations
to consult widely among their membership. It took just a few hours for one
of the trade union barons to undermine Mr Smith's effort to ensure the
democratic legitimacy of his candidature when Britain's second-biggest
union, the AEU engineering union, immediately endorsed him as its preferred
candidate. Mr Bill Jordan, the union president, brushed aside the commitment
to the 'wider democracy' offered by Mr Smith with the comment that he did
not want to 'waste time and money on a ballot of members'.
The response from Mr Smith's opponents was predictable. No wonder, they
said, the shadow chancellor had refused at his press conference to offer any
commitment to get rid of the trade union block vote.
That was less than fair. If Mr Smith was determined not to set in concrete
his prescription for electoral success, his outlook is hardly shrouded in
mystery. He is committed to devolution both for Scotland and Wales and for
the English regions. Yesterday he backed the introduction of a 'Bill of
Rights'. He is not prepared yet to put on the record his support for
electoral reform at Westminster but is moving inexorably in that direction.
Mr Robin Cook and Mr Jack Cunningham, his two campaign managers, are among
the most committed in the shadow cabinet to proportional representation. For
all his reticence yesterday, Mr Smith also believes there is no long-term
future for the trade union block vote in shaping Labour's policies.

MR PADDY Ashdown, Liberal Democrat leader, yesterday called on the next
Labour leader to join his party in initiating a commission on electoral
reform.
A joint inquiry should be an early priority for the incoming Labour leader,
because as the next general election approaches, 'political competition will
inevitably come between us, disappointing many millions who want to see an
end to Conservative hegemony', Mr Ashdown said.
He proposed a National Electoral Reform Commission open to politicians,
churches, trade unionists and other organisations. It would resolve how a

   By JAMES BUXTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR John Major, the prime minister, has caused a significant shift in the
political alignment of the Scottish Office ministerial team, which could
herald a change in government policy for Scotland.
He has brought in two new faces. Lord Fraser of Carmyllie, up to now Lord
Advocate, is to be minister of state and deputy to Mr Ian Lang, the
secretary of state. Sir Hector Monro, the MP for Dumfries, is to be one of
three parliamentary under-secretaries.
Mr Michael Forsyth, formerly minister of state in charge of education and
health, is to leave the Scottish Office for the Department of Employment.
Lord Strathclyde is also to leave the Scottish Office for the same
department.
Lord James Douglas-Hamilton and Mr Allan Stewart will remain as
parliamentary under-secretaries.
Whereas Mr Forsyth is known for his Thatcherite views, and Lord Strathclyde
is to the right of the Conservative party, Lord Fraser, who has become well
known to the public for his handling of the Lockerbie bombing in 1998, is to
the left of many in the Tory party. He is an honorary president of the Tory
Reform Group in Scotland, which favours some form of devolved Scottish
assembly.
Sir Hector, who last held ministerial office at the Environment Department
in 1981, has been critical of some of the Thatcherite policies pursued by Mr
Forsyth.

FT  15 APR 92 / Most unions reject ballots despite criticism: The race to
lead Labour
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MOST UNION leaderships are to reject the idea of balloting their members on
who to support in the Labour leadership election, in spite of criticism that
other methods give too much influence to union leaders.
Leaders of the AEU engineering decided yesterday on 'widespread
consultation' among members rather than a secret ballot. The executive of
the Usdaw shop workers said its union conference would make the decision.
Leaders of both unions have indicated support for Mr John Smith, shadow
chancellor. Usdaw said it was advising its conference to back him.
Among the 10 largest unions only the GMB general workers, the GPMU print
workers and the NCU communication workers seem certain to hold ballots.
The TGWU general union is likely to consult members through branches and the
MSF general technical union's decision is likely to be made by its annual
conference.
If Nupe follows the practice it adopted during the last leadership election,
the matter will be decided by shows of hands at branch meetings.
Mr Smith, declaring his candidacy yesterday, called for ballots wherever
possible. Unions cite lack of time and money as reasons for rejecting
ballots. One difficulty is separating members who contribute to union
political funds from others who could not expect a vote in a ballot.
In the party's electoral college 40 per cent of the votes will be cast by
unions.
Mr Bill Jordan, AEU president, said a ballot could not be arranged quickly
and the union's political fund was empty following the general election.
Balloting the AEU's 630,000 members would cost Pounds 110,000. That cost
would increase after the AEU merges with the 360,000 EETPU electricians'
union next month. The executive of the EETPU is also against a ballot.
Although the AEU decision was made before the Labour national executive
chose July 18, rather than June, for a special conference, the executive is
still likely to be against a ballot because of the cost.
Ironically, the AEU believes that the Labour leadership should be decided by
one person, one vote among party members. Along with the EETPU, the AEU
championed wide use of ballots in internal leadership contests.
The AEU executive decision could, however, be challenged when the union's
policy-making national committee meets next month.
Mr Jimmy Airlie, an AEU executive councillor, argued yesterday that the
union should abstain in the leadership election if it could not hold a
ballot.
Mr Garfield Davies, Usdaw general secretary, said his membership would be
fully consulted through the branch structure and the executive would vote to
tell the 800 conference delegates whether to accept the executive's
recommendation to support Mr Smith.
Mr Davies said a ballot would be expensive and turnout would be low. Usdaw's
method would provide the best gauge of membership opinion.

be clear for President Bush and EC President Jacques Delors, who meet in
Washington next week, to end a deadlock in the Uruguay Round of world trade
talks.
Brussels officials would say only that the negotiators were meeting for one
day at a hotel near London's Heathrow airport. They refused to disclose if
headway was made.
Next week's Washington summit, originally a routine meeting between the two
leaders, has assumed greater importance as it has become clear it provides
one of the last chances for significant progress in winning a Uruguay Round
agreement before November's US presidential elections. If it fails, many
fear trade conflicts will grow in the months ahead, especially between the
US, the EC and Japan  - as international business leaders have indicated in
a letter to heads of state and governments of major trading nations.*
The US negotiating team was made up of Mr Julius Katz and Mr Richard Crowder
from the US Trade Representative's Office. EC negotiators were Mr Guy
Legras, director-general for agriculture, and Mr Hugo Paeman, the EC's
senior trade negotiator. After months of often acrimonious negotiation
between the US and the EC on farm trade reform, differences have been
narrowed to:
EC demands that income support to farmers should not be defined as
trade-distorting;
EC demands for the US to restrain exports to Europe of cereal substitutes;
US demands for the EC to limit the volume as well as the value of farm
exports;
EC demands that the US accept a 'peace clause' under which US companies
agree not to challenge EC subsidies under US law.
Observers in Geneva say differences on these issues are now small, the only
thing preventing agreement being a lack of political will. At the fore of
those pressing for a farm trade settlement is Mr Jurgen Mollemann, Germany's
economics minister, who argued recently that leaders from the Group of Seven
industrial countries should call a special summit if next week's Washington
talks fail to win a breakthrough.
Germans' anxieties focus on a G7 summit being hosted by Chancellor Helmut
Kohl in Munich in July. They fear acrimony over the failure to liberalise
trade may sour the meeting. But France, the EC's biggest farm exporter, has
shown no sign of the flexibility needed for a Gatt deal. French farmers
believe the new premier, Mr Pierre Beregovoy, will resist pressure for deep
cuts in farm subsidies.

<TEXT>
THE United Auto Workers union has agreed to end its strike against
Caterpillar, the world's biggest maker of earth-moving equipment, according
to the federal mediator assigned to talks, Reuter reports from Chicago.
The UAW will continue to meet company officials to negotiate a new labour
contract.
After two days of meetings in Chicago, the Federal Mediation and
Conciliation Service said in a statement that Caterpillar agreed not to
replace those UAW workers who had been on strike against the company.
Mr Bernard DeLury, the mediator, said he had made various recommendations to
representatives of Caterpillar and the UAW to end the strike and that the
union had agreed to return to work without condition.
There was no immediate indication of when about 12,000 striking union
members would return to their jobs at Caterpillar plants in several Illinois
communities.
Last week Caterpillar unilaterally imposed its final contract offer and
asked strikers to return to their jobs. It claims that more than 750 have
crossed the picket line.
The UAW went on strike in November when the company refused to accept a new
three-year labour agreement patterned after the union's contract with Deere
&amp; Co, the tractor manufacturer.
The dispute is regarded as the most serious US labour-management
confrontation in a decade.
Separately, Caterpillar said in a statement that an Illinois circuit court
judge would ask the UAW to show why it was not in contempt of court for
allegedly violating an injunction restricting picket-line activities.
Caterpillar said 18 strikers blocked plant gates and threatened returning
workers with bodily harm.
A contempt hearing will be held on May 18.

FT  15 APR 92 / Trading in Chicago hit for second day: Flooded business
district is declared disaster area
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CHICAGO'S business district was declared a disaster area yesterday after
flooding of the city's underground tunnel system on Monday cut power
supplies and closed offices.
Many buildings in the city's downtown area were shut for a second day after
a tunnel under the Chicago River burst. Damages could reach several billion
dollars, although assessments are still being made.
The Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) remained closed and the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange (CME), while unaffected directly, closed early except for trading
in its stock index futures. The equity-based futures, which have an
important impact on share dealing in New York, were traded during normal
hours.
The CME said it shortened its day as the clearing of trades was difficult
given that many member firms were closed by the flood.
The CBOT, which still has a flooded basement, will open from noon to 2pm
local time today while the CME will be trading normally.
Emergency crews cut the water flow into the tunnels to a trickle yesterday.
Many of the buildings affected by flooding were still without electricity
and thousands of workers were unable to return to work or were sent home
early.
Companies scrambled to find temporary office space, some trying to fulfil an
April 15 deadline for tax receipts. However, the Internal Revenue Service
extended the tax deadline by a week for those affected by the flood.
Mayor Richard Daley has dismissed the city's acting director of
transportation, Mr John LaPlante, who knew about a leak in the tunnel at
least a month before it burst, but failed to act quickly enough to correct
it.

FT  15 APR 92 / Half of America turns to the apathy party: The decline in
voter participation in the US, especially among blacks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHILE some US voters have shown how disgruntled they are with their
political leaders this year by voting them out of office, more have joined
the other half who do not vote at all.
Last week, in New York state's apparently vigorously contested Democratic
primary, fewer than 1m people troubled to register their preference between
Governor Bill Clinton of Arkansas, former Governor Jerry Brown of California
and the phantom candidate, former Senator Paul Tsongas of Massachusetts  - a
38 per cent fall from the turnout in 1988.
Except for New Hampshire, which held the first primary, turnout has declined
uniformly this year. Only around 9.4m Democratic voters have turned out in
primaries so far this year, compared with 11.8m at the same stage of the
1988 presidential campaign.
But if voter participation has declined overall, in the black population it
has plummeted: down 40 per cent in Georgia, for example, and down 61 per
cent in Louisiana.
Some of the low turnout, both in general and among black voters in
particular, can be attributed to voters' dissatisfaction with the way in
which candidates are addressing the issues that most concern them, say
activists working for greater voter participation.
'What we have seen so far is candidates of both parties speaking to the
so-called forgotten middle class but not couching their language in such a
way as to appeal to black voters,' says Ms Sonia Jarvis, executive director
of the National Coalition on Black Voter Participation.
Another factor has been the attempt by many states, especially in the south,
to maximise their electoral clout by grouping their primaries.
With seven states voting on March 3 and another 11 on March 10, so-called
'Super Tuesday', candidates had to spread their resources thinly and were
unable to whip up much enthusiasm among voters who barely knew their names,
far less their faces or their policies.
But low turnout also reflects both structural barriers to voting and a
long-term trend of declining participation. Unlike other industrialised
countries, the US requires its citizens to jump through several hoops to
register to vote.
Many states, for example, require voters to appear in person at the
registrar's office  - which may be open only during weekday office hours.
Even those that allow citizens to register by post sometime require
notarised proof of identity.
'There is a notion that voting is really a privilege rather than a
fundamental right, and people have to prove themselves worthy by taking the
initiative,' says Mr Ed Brown, director of the Voter Education Project  - an
Atlanta-based organisation which took the lead in breaking down the barriers
raised against black voters in the south in the 1960s, but which closed its
doors last month for lack of money.
The charitable foundations which used to fund its work have turned to other
causes. Some, more politically aligned, became disillusioned in the 1980s as
voter registration drives bore more fruit for the Republicans than for the
Democratic party. Those that remain interested in voter participation have
turned to legislative efforts to make registration easier.
Ms Jarvis says that registration rules in most states were drawn up either
after the Civil War or at the turn of the century at a time of heavy
immigration from central Europe, and were always intended to discriminate.
While blacks are no longer made to construe Greek or count the bubbles in a
bar of soap  - traditional tests used to prevent them from registering in
the old south  - the barriers of inconvenience affect the generally
lower-income black population disproportionately.
'If you're poor and black and live in rural Mississippi and work in a
catfish processing plant, no one is going to give you time off to go to
register to vote,' Mr Brown says.
But Mr Curtis Gans, director of the Committee for the Study of the American
Electorate, warns that there is a long-term trend of declining electoral
participation that reflects voters' disillusionment with the political
process.
Changes in the law to allow citizens to register to vote at the polling
booth on election day might add another 6m or 7m voters to the 91.6m who
voted in the last presidential election, he says, but would not reverse the
trend.
'A lot of the declining participation has to do with the erosion of the will
to vote,' he says.
Reduced black participation is likely to be particularly damaging to the
Democratic candidate in the presidential election in November. Although the
black vote has become much less monolithic than in the recent past, some 75
to 85 per cent are still likely to vote Democratic.
It is not a matter of whether the Democratic candidate garners the black
vote, says Mr Brown, it is a question of how much.
'The view is that blacks have nowhere else to go but blacks always have
somewhere to go: they can go fishing.'

FT  15 APR 92 / Bond formally declared bankrupt: Order marks the end of
entrepreneur's involvement in business
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN

<DATELINE>
   SYDNEY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR ALAN BOND, the Australian entrepreneur whose flamboyant rise was matched
only by his dramatic fall, was declared bankrupt yesterday after a legal
battle lasting almost a year.
The bankruptcy order marks the formal end of Mr Bond's involvement in
business, but not the end of his career as a public figure, which is likely
to last for at least another year.
In addition to further bankruptcy hearings, he faces criminal charges in
Perth, and is the subject of inquiries by the Australian Securities
Commission (ASC) and a Royal Commission into alleged corruption in Western
Australia. Mr Bond is also in early stages of divorce proceedings from his
wife Eileen, which could become entangled with bankruptcy hearings into the
disposal of his assets.
Ironically, Mr Bond was not in the federal court in Sydney to hear Mr
Justice Morling appoint Mr Robert Ramsay, a Western Australian accountant,
as his trustee in bankruptcy.
Mr Bond was giving evidence to the royal commission in Perth, which sat in
secret to avoid compromising his trial on fraud charges, which is due to
open on May 25. Mr Bond denies the charges.
The judge's ruling followed a series of court hearings and appeals by Mr
Bond against an earlier order that he was liable to pay a personal debt of
USDollars 194m to to a banking syndicate led by the Hongkong Bank of
Australia.
The debt relates to personal guarantees given by Mr Bond against loans by
the syndicate to Dallhold Investments, a private company controlled by the
Bond family which has nickel mining interests.
Justice Morling rejected arguments by Mr Bond's lawyers that an affidavit
presented by the creditors was deficient, and that the hearing should be
postponed for two weeks to allow him to take further legal advice.
Mr Ramsay said he expected to meet Mr Bond shortly to demand a statement of
his financial affairs and assets, confiscate his passport, and begin an
examination of a group of family trusts.
Mr Bond will have to ask Mr Ramsay's permission to travel abroad, own a car
worth more than ADollars 2,500, or negotiate credit of more than ADollars
500. 'He would have to have a good reason to convince me that he should have
his passport back,' Mr Ramsay said.
Mr Bond resigned as chairman of Bond Corporation Holdings, his flagship
listed company, in September 1990, two days before the group announced an
Australian record loss of ADollars 2.24bn.
Bond Corp is being restructured under a debt for equity swap which will
transfer more than 90 per cent of the company's equity to its creditors,
mostly European bondholders. Most of the company's assets have been sold.
At his peak in the mid 1980s, Mr Bond was estimated by an Australian
business magazine to be worth more than ADollars 100m. He won the America's
Cup for Australia, and in 1987 was named Australian of the Year. His public
displays of wealth were famous, and his life seemed divided between country
estates in Britain and Australia, luxury yachts and intercontinental
commuting by private aircraft.
Bond Corp and a network of subsidiaries and associates controlled
newspapers, television stations, and a number of major breweries, including
G. Heilemann in the US and the Toohey's, Castlemaine XXXX and Swan brands in
Australia. The group also built up significant shareholdings in a range of
overseas companies, including Allied Lyons, the diversified UK food and
drink group; TV-am, the UK television station; M &amp; G, Britain's biggest unit
trust, and Airship Industries.
The end came after a risky foray against Lonrho, the diversified UK group
managed by Mr Roland 'Tiny' Rowland, provoked a document identifying
numerous financial weaknesses in Bond Corp's structure.
Mr Bond's remaining assets are unclear. He told a court last September that
he had little left apart from ADollars 50,000 in three bank accounts. Some
personal assets such as furniture are believed to have been disposed of
since then.

ISRAEL'S defence minister, Mr Moshe Arens, told a parliamentary committee
yesterday that the government was in favour of holding municipal elections
in the occupied territories for the first time in 16 years, Reuter reports
officials as saying in Jerusalem.
They said he told the foreign affairs and defence committee that the
government wanted to appoint municipal committees in the West Bank and Gaza
Strip to prepare for elections.
Palestinian peace negotiators oppose the idea, first raised publicly during
a visit by a senior defence ministry official to the West Bank city of
Hebron last week. Ghassan al-Khatib said that raising the elections idea
pre-empted Palestinian demands for general elections for a legislative
council in the West Bank and Gaza.
The last municipal elections in the West Bank were in 1976. Israel has since
refused Palestinian demands for elections and has appointed local officials
to run the municipalities.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
WESTERN diplomats have issued a formal warning to Iraq not to provoke the
coalition forces operating in the north of the country.
Diplomats from the US, France and the UK met Mr Abdul Amir al Anbari, the
Iraqi ambassador to the United Nations, yesterday to warn him of the
consequences if his country did not halt all threatening military activity.
The coalition members demanded the withdrawal of the anti-aircraft missiles
Iraq has deployed north of the 36th parallel in an area close to the
protected zone they have established to safeguard Kurdish refugees.
They also warned Iraq not to fly fighter aircraft north of the 36th
parallel, and not to attack either the Kurds in the north or the Shia
minority in the south of the country.
Diplomats said that although the demarche was made only by the US, France
and the UK, it had been discussed beforehand with other coalition members,
including Turkey. Turkey is understood to have shown some reluctance to go
along with the warning, in part because of its conflict with its own Kurdish
minority.
Iraq's deployment of Soviet-made Sam-2 and Sam-3 missile batteries and its
attempts to track coalition aircraft with the batteries' radar have aroused
considerable concern among the allies.
Mr Brent Scowcroft, President George Bush's national security adviser,
described the move as 'very ominous' and said that he would not rule out
military action if Iraq persisted.
Admiral David Jeremiah, vice-chairman of the US joint chiefs of staff, added
the coalition partners viewed the presence of the missiles with
'considerable concern'.
'Surface-to-air missiles have no purpose other than to be used against
aircraft, and the only aircraft flying in that area are allied,' he said.

<TEXT>
INDIA'S prime minister, Mr P V Narasimha Rao, appeared last night to have
silenced critics of his economic policies in the ruling Congress party with
a statement of party doctrine emphasising cautious change.
A resolution put last night before the All India Congress Committee (AICC)
 -the party's main policy-making body -reaffirmed the party's commitment to
pursuing policies to improve competitiveness and productivity. But he also
paid lip service to the legacy of the Nehru family by declaring his support
for 'the Nehru vision of democracy, socialism and planning'.
The resolution, expected to be approved today, denies that there has been
any U-turn in economic policies and emphasises 'change with continuity'.
It makes no mention of privatisation or of controversial proposed measures
to allow industry more freedom to declare redundancies.
The cautious language of the document underlines the resistance that
pro-market economic policies still face within the party. But the
endorsement of February's budget, including partial convertibility of the
rupee, is believed to give the prime minister a free hand to continue
liberalisation.

THE US yesterday intervened in Angola's faltering peace process, telling
government and opposition parties preparations for September elections were

Mr Herman Cohen, US assistant secretary of state for Africa, said in Luanda
that although progress had been made, including the announcement of a date
for the polls on September 29 and 30, there was still much to be done and
little time to do it in.
A peace accord was signed in May last year between the governing MPLA and
opposition Unita movement, ending 16 years of hostilities.
Mr Cohen urged the government of Mr Jose Eduardo dos Santos to complete the
legalisation of opposition parties and rapidly appoint a director-general to
supervise an electoral commission. He also said it was essential that the
central administration be extended to territory controlled by Unita.

EXPERTS battling the flow of lava on Mount Etna have claimed their first

threatening the village of Zafferana, Reuter reports.
Italian navy experts set off 400lbs of explosives to break open the walls of
a channel down which the lava is flowing from the volcano at a rate of five
yards an hour. Much of the lava then poured out of the channel and
dispersed, considerably reducing the main flow.
Mr Nicola Capria, civil protection minister, said: 'The situation is now
less dramatic but. . . the monster is very, very strong.'
Further down Etna, the lava engulfed a small white-walled cottage within
1,000 yards of the outskirts of Zafferana.

UKRAINE is to resume transfers of tactical nuclear weapons to Russia for
destruction, Mr Anatoly Zlenko, the country's foreign minister, said
yesterday, Reuter reports from Kiev.
Mr Zlenko said the transfers would resume in 'the coming days,' but gave no
date.
The suspension had widened divisions with Russia over military policy and
brought a sharp response from the West.
The cessation had threatened the Start treaty between the Soviet Union and
the US to slash nuclear arsenals and heightened concern inabout the former
Soviet nuclear arsenal slipping out of control.

FT  15 APR 92 / Parliament's champion takes on Yeltsin
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SCARCELY noticed by the outside world, Mr Ruslan Khasbulatov, the Russian
parliament's powerful chairman, has been pulling the strings in this week's
showdown between the government and parliament, writes Leyla Boulton in
Moscow.
Although a tentative peace was reached yesterday without his involvement, he
will remain a key figure after the dust settles from this conflict and the
ground is prepared for an inevitable second round.
The cabinet, pushed to the brink of resigning by Mr Khasbulatov's attempts
to be the key influence over both economic policy and the government, will
today try to make the settlement of the reform issue as final as possible.
'I think he wants absolute power,' warned one cabinet minister. 'He wants to
have the government under the full control of parliament, one that is his
own.'
Sometimes his behaviour is counterproductive, however. On Monday he
described the government as 'kids who had lost their nerve', causing such a
storm that he felt he had to appear on nationwide television to apologise  -
and ended up aiding the government he was seeking to criticise.
Behind him stands a solid majority of deputies, elected under an antiquated
electoral system which makes them fear for their survival in the new Russia.
They initially refused to elect the former economics professor when his
candidacy was put forward by President Boris Yeltsin last year, but they
have now rallied round him because of his struggle for more powers for
parliament.
Despite distaste for his often sharp and contemptuous behaviour, their
interests now fully coincide.
As Russia's parliamentary chairman, Mr Khasbulatov has greater powers than a
western-style parliamentary speaker, especially in the legal limbo while
Russia decides a new constitution.
For months he has carefully cultivated all the interest groups  - from state
industry to collective farms to ethnic minorities  - which have been
alienated or hurt by the radical market reforms of Mr Yegor Gaidar, the
first deputy prime minister. Making much of his own background in economics,
his claims of less painful ways to build a market economy have found lively
support.
Mr Plotnikov said Mr Khasbulatov was now intent on distancing parliament
from the government which he described as 'a deadweight which would drown
any swimmer'. 'This cabinet is clearly doomed to go - but only sometime this
autumn. At that point it will have to be replaced by others because the
population of Russia does not approve of being dragged through such misery.'
Mr Khasbulatov has little respect for democratic niceties, saying of
Moscow's directly-elected mayor: 'We can remove him as easily as we
installed him.'
Such a fate might one day befall him. Asked if Mr Khasbulatov could win, Mr
Pyotr Filippov, a radical deputy, says: 'In the short-term maybe but not in
the long term. The president needs to deliver just one blow.'

FT  15 APR 92 / Pay figures bring disappointment
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
LATEST figures showing pay levels falling, but not as quickly as hoped, will
disappoint both employers and the government. The Department of Employment
is expected to announce a small drop in underlying average earnings for
February  - which still leaves average earnings rising at more than 3
percentage points above the rate of inflation.

FT  15 APR 92 / Output rise gives boost to UK recovery hopes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN and EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HOPES THAT the British economy might be recovering from recession were given
a boost yesterday by news that industrial production and manufacturing
output increased by 1.1 per cent in February.
The increase, which caught economists by surprise, brought the seasonally
adjusted index of manufacturing output back to the levels last seen in the
autumn. It also helped to push sterling to a six-month high against the
D-Mark of just under DM2.92, before closing in London at DM2.9125 compared
with Monday's DM2.915. In late New York trading it stood at DM2.9145.
The government received somewhat less encouraging news on inflation.
The output price index for home sales of manufactured goods increased by 0.8
per cent between February and March, lifting the year-on-year inflation rate
for goods at the factory gate to 4.5 per cent last month from 4.4 per cent
in February.
Economists said this slight upwards movement in output price inflation
reduced still further the prospect of an early cut in UK bank base rates
from their current 10.5 per cent level.
In spite of February's growth in output, manufacturing production was down
by 2.9 per cent in the three months to February compared with the same
period a year ago.
Comparisons of production trends in the latest three months with the three
months to November last year also show an economy still stuck in recession.
Output of the energy industries fell by 2 per cent, due mainly to February's
milder weather, while manufacturing output between the two latest three
month periods declined by 0.5 per cent.
However, a 0.8 per cent rise in output of consumer goods in the latest three
months led to some speculation that a consumer-led recovery might be
imminent.
Production in the engineering industries suffered a 1.1 per cent drop in the
latest three months, despite higher car production in February.
The rise in industrial production in February came after several recent
tentative indicators of recovery. Treasury officials said that with election
uncertainties out of the way February's manufacturing production level might
now be a platform for further output growth.
Some increase in output prices had been expected last month because the
government increased excise duties in its March 10 Budget. A 0.4 per cent
increase in the output price index excluding food, drink and tobacco between
February and March suggested that manufacturers' prices rose for other
reasons too.
However, the Treasury saw little reason to fear a resurgence of output price
inflation.
Input prices were subdued. The price index for materials and fuel purchased
by manufacturers fell by a seasonally adjusted 0.5 per cent between February
and March and rose 0.1 per cent in the 12 months to March.

FT  15 APR 92 / Hongkong bids Pounds 3.1bn for Midland: City disappointed as
all-paper offer falls well below expected level of 400p a share
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BARCHARD, ALEXANDER NICOLL and ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HONGKONG and Shanghai Bank yesterday offered Pounds 3.1bn in shares and
bonds for Midland, the UK's third-largest bank, when it announced terms of
its long-awaited bid.
The offer, which is being recommended to Midland's shareholders by the
bank's board, would make Midland one of the six main subsidiaries within an
enlarged Hongkong and Shanghai group, though it would retain its own board
and senior executives as well as its name.
In the City, where investors have been waiting since March 16 for news of
the offer by HSBC Holdings, parent of Hongkong Bank, there was
disappointment at the price of 378p for each Midland share. This was well
below the expected level of about 400p, the price understood to have been
offered by Lloyds Bank in an informal approach earlier this year to
Midland's board.
Midland's shares fell by 7p during the day to close at 365p. Before talks
between Midland and HSBC were announced in March, Midland shares were
trading at 253p. In Hong Kong, HSBC's share price ended 25 cents down at
HKDollars 39.25 (288p).
Mr Brian Pearse, Midland's chief executive, said he was sad the bank was
surrendering its independence, but had concluded that the deal with HSBC
would give Midland the extra capital strength it needed. Midland, the
weakest of the 'Big Four' UK clearing banks, made a slender profit of Pounds
36m in 1991.
Mr Pearse emphasised that if the takeover did not go through, Midland would
be strong enough to survive on its own.
A merger between HSBC and Midland has been on the cards since 1987 when HSBC
bought 14.9 per cent of Midland and the two banks began to merge some of
their international operations.
The takeover would make HSBC group the second-largest bank in the world
outside Japan, with total assets of Pounds 145bn and 3,300 offices in 68
countries. HSBC Holdings, the Hong Kong bank's parent, is already legally
based in London. It plans to move its management to London next January,
making the group resident in the UK for tax purposes.
HSBC will apply for a primary listing on the London Stock Exchange, making
it eligible for the FT-SE 100 index. It will retain its primary listing in
Hong Kong.
HSBC will issue 704m new shares and Pounds 704m in 10-year bonds to pay for
the purchase of Midland. Shareholders will be offered one share in the new
HSBC holding company and Pounds 1 in the HSBC bonds for each Midland share,
leaving them with about a third of the new group. Under Takeover Panel
rules, the offer document must be sent to shareholders within 28 days.
The advisers on the deal are Schroders for HSBC, and SG Warburg and Samuel
Montagu for Midland.
Lloyds was yesterday studying the offer for Midland before deciding on a
possible counterbid. It does not feel under any pressure to launch a bid
immediately, because of the timescale involved in the offer.
Midland turned down the bid by Lloyds because it was concerned that the UK
and European Community competition authorities would block any offer by
Lloyds. However, Lloyds believes it can present a good case to the
competition authorities.
Lloyds wants to buy Midland because it believes it can make huge cost
savings by combining the banks' branch networks, closing down hundreds of
branches and cutting the workforce by about 20,000.
The Chinese government yesterday indicated it would not hinder HSBC's
takeover of Midland, though it repeated its demand that the crown colony's
biggest bank continue to play a full role in its economy.
The statement made no comment on the terms of the proposed deal, but it was
the clearest sign yet that HSBC, which has kept the Chinese authorities
informed of its plans, would not run into opposition from Beijing.

FT  15 APR 92 / Major draws on wide range of party views in shake-up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN MAJOR showed evi-dence of determination to draw his government from
all elements of the Conservative party in his first full-scale ministerial
reshuffle.
He promoted Mr Jonathan Aitken, a long-standing backbench Euro-sceptic, and
Mr Michael Mates, who ran Mr Michael Heseltine's leadership campaign.
But the largest shake-up of government posts since 1979, including the
cabinet moves, hit an unexpected obstacle when Mrs Edwina Currie turned down
the chance to return to government.
The sharpest promotion is that of Mr Stephen Dorrell, who moves from junior
health minister to become financial secretary to the Treasury.
Other new Treasury ministers are Sir John Cope, a Tory party deputy chairman
previously a minister, and Mr Anthony Nelson, who joins the government as
economic secretary.
Mr Major has appointed some longer-serving MPs whose abilities languished on
the back benches during the Thatcher years. These include Mr Nigel Forman,
parliamentary private secretary to Mr Nigel Lawson as chancellor, who
becomes a junior education minister, and Mr Charles Wardle, who goes to the
Home Office.
Mr Aitken becomes a defence minister while Mr Mates, chairman of the
cross-party Anglo-Irish Group and a former army colonel, becomes a minister
at the Northern Ireland Office.
The most rapid promotion goes to Sir Derek Spencer QC, elected Conservative
MP for Brighton Pavilion last week, who collected a knighthood on being
appointed solicitor-general.
Sir Derek, 56, parliamentary private secretary to the attorney-general in
1986-87, was MP for Leicester South from 1983 until the 1987 general
election when he lost the seat to Labour by 1,877 votes.
The reshuffle is also intended to strengthen the ministerial team in the
House of Lords. Baroness Denton becomes a junior trade and industry
minister, and Baroness Cumberlege a junior health minister.
Mr John Redwood, former corporate affairs minister, and Mr David Maclean,
who was at the agriculture ministry, become Environment Department ministers
of state. Mr Tim Eggar and Mr Richard Needham become the trade and industry
ministers. Mr Robert Atkins, the sports minister, becomes a minister of
state, Northern Ireland.
There was surprise at Westminster that Mrs Currie turned down the
opportunity to be a middle-ranking minister. The speculation was that she
had been offered a minister of state post at the Home Office.
She said she thought someone else could 'do the job far better than I, so I
have declined'. Mr Kenneth Clarke, home secretary, was health secretary at
the time Mrs Currie resigned as a junior health minister over remarks about
British egg production being infected with salmonella.
Taking into account the cabinet changes and those ministers who lost their
seats, 22 have left the government, though only six of those resigned
yesterday.

FT  15 APR 92 / UN spurns Tripoli's offer of Malta trial
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   CAIRO, THE UN, THE HAGUE
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
LIBYA faces worldwide sanctions today, after the United Nations last night
brushed aside Tripoli's offer to put the two alleged Lockerbie bombers on
trial in Malta.
The 15-member UN Security Council rejected a Moroccan request in private
consultations in New York to delay sanctions to consider the Libyan offer.
The UN resolve set the stage for punitive measures, including an arms and
air embargo, against the North African state.
Sir David Hannay, Britain's ambassador to the UN, said sanctions would go
ahead unless Libya made a last-minute decision to comply fully with UN
demands  - which he considered 'extraordinarily unlikely'.
The UN wants the two men  - accused of blowing up the Pan Am jet over
Lockerbie in Scotland in 1988 with the loss of 270 lives  - surrendered for
trial in Britain or the US.
Malta said yesterday it would agree to Libya's request to put the men on
trial, provided all parties agreed to this.
But Sir David Hannay said Libya's proposal 'posed a condition which is
unacceptable to our governments, which is that the trial can only,
exclusively, take place in Malta'.
Earlier yesterday the International Court in The Hague rejected Libya's plea
to bar the US and Britain from taking punitive measures.
The court said Security Council Resolution 748 imposing sanctions should
override all other international agreements. President George Bush said this
was 'a very good decision'.
Libya defiantly isolated itself from the world yesterday by declaring a 'day
of mourning' and cutting external air and telecommunications links. The
national news agency Jana said this had nothing to do with sanctions but was
a mark of respect for 37 Libyans who died in US bombing raids in April 1986.
Most Arab states have indicated that they would reluctantly agree to fall
into line with the UN air embargo, although both Egypt and Tunisia are
planning to facilitate travel across their frontiers with Libya.
EgyptAir and Libyan Arab Airlines have agreed to begin shuttle services to
airstrips on each side of the Egypt-Libya border. Tunisia is making similar
arrangements.
Some 30 offices of Libyan Arab Airlines are expected to be closed worldwide
and Libyan diplomatic representation will be thinned out under the terms of
the UN resolution. The sanctions will not affect Libyan oil exports or
shipping services.

FT  15 APR 92 / Survey of Seville and World Expo '92 (11): A feast of
architecture - Top international designers have a field day
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By COLIN AMERY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STOCKHOLM FAIR, 1930; New York World Fair, 1939; Festival of Britain, 1951;
Brussels World Fair, 1958; Montreal, 1967; Osaka, 1970 - the list of great
exhibitions this century has offered a great series of opportunities for
architects and builders to raise structures symbolic of their times. How
often have the opportunities been seized to make architectural and
engineering advances that might compare to the daring originality of the
Crystal Palace designed for the Great Exhibition in London of 1851?
It was in 1929 that Seville last hosted a great international exhibition,
the Exposicion Ibero-Americana which was a companion to the Barcelona
Exposicion Internacional in the same year.
This year, the original plan was for Chicago to share the commemoration of
the 1492 journey of discovery to America by hosting a parallel event in the
Windy City. It would also have marked the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition
 -one of the most architecturally magnificent fairs on the shores of Lake
Michigan but its palaces were made of plaster and decidedly temporary.
Architecturally, what is to be made of Seville's expo? Siting the Expo on
the 500 acres of the island of La Cartuja provided a more or less virgin
site around the old monastery. The situation also necessitated new bridges
and an upgrading of the river banks which will be a positive and lasting
benefit to the city. The island site has natural limits and so any visitor
may well be surprised at the very high density of the exhibition layout.
There are 103 participating nations and, although the planning allows for
shaded walks and fountains, the pavilions are crammed together.
The architectural dilemma facing any designer for a pavilion for a world
fair is how can contemporary architecture, which is more or less a universal
language, be used to exemplify national characteristics ? National
architectural styles do appear at Seville, but the overall appearance is of
futuristic modernism in keeping with the theme of 'Discovery' which runs
through the fair.
The organisers of the fair did lay down some ground rules for designers.
They insisted on what they called 'urban architecture' - more substantial
designs than is usual for temporary exhibitions as some 35 per cent of the
structures will remain as will most of the infrastructure as the basis of a
science and research park. Maximum height limits have been imposed (up to 25
metres) and, in the turgid language of the brief, 'homogenous density of
building following a city/garden typology', has meant an agreeable scale and
a sense of an extremely well landscaped site.
There has also been insistence upon 'green' environmental conditions and the
use of water and planting to ensure some relief from the intense heat of a
Seville summer. There is also a unity of design in the street furniture,
signage, paving, pergolas, and fountains. The overall sense of a site
devised to reflect the best features of outdoor Mediterranean life looks
very successful.
The whole site is organised into a series of five international avenues, and
an avenue of discovery that is the backbone of the expo. There is also a
series of special public and performance areas around water. There are,
besides the national pavilions, theme pavilions on subjects such as
'discovery', 'the future' and 'navigation', and the Expo Building itself,
which has a definite future as a World Trade Centre.
It is the Avenue of Europe (designers Hennin and Lippsmeier) which is the
visible centre of the site. Here is also made plain the difficulty that
modern designers have in expressing political ideas in any convincing built
form. The 12 countries of the European Community are represented by 12
30-metre high towers.
In shape these towers resemble the chimneys of the old Carthusian monastery
and they are also designed to cool the air in the manner of the simple
towers that cooled Moorish houses in Spain and North Africa. At the centre
of the European boulevard is a giant plastic funnel composed of a swirl of
translucent flags of the 12 nations. The lack of any shared symbolism is
depressing - the glorious union of a free Europe that has vanquished
communism and atheism is not represented ]
For the visitor it is worth singling out some of the most interesting
architecture of the national pavilions. With more than 100 to choose from
the selection has to be subjective. The most cohesive and effective example
of national architecture is the Japanese pavilion designed by Tadao Ando. It
is a 25-metre high timber structure that is reminiscent of a brooding
ancient temple. An escalator and staircase climb steeply to the bridge that
is at its centre. It is both monumental and simple - and cleverly
representative of both the past and the present in Japan.
The Greek pavilion (architect Mariano Villalonga) looks like a truncated
petrol station with a few attached columns; and the Italian pavilion
(architects Gae Aulenti and Pier Luigi Spadolini) sadly is more like an
office block than the fortified Italian palazzo it is supposed to represent.
The Hungarian pavilion (architect Imre Makowecz) is a remarkable and
beautifully built example of a national tradition. Representing a
seven-towered wooden rural church, the interior is filled by a complete
tree, its roots visible through a glass floor. The symbolism is clear - a
country wanting to show that its roots belong in the west and it is now free
to celebrate both its history and its future.
The British pavilion is designed by Nicholas Grimshaw and it takes up the
water theme of the expo in a spectacular way with a wall of moving water as
the main elevation of the pavilion. Is there some significance that the
British pavilion faces down the Avenue of Europe but has to be entered by a
bridge over the troubled waters of its own moat?
As an example of high-tech architecture the British pavilion is one of the
most rational designs and visually undoubtedly a great success. It is
worthwhile to compare it with the German pavilion - another exercise in
structural virtuosity designed by architect Lippsmeier.
Although the architectural opportunities at Seville have been significant I
suspect that it will be the planning of the site and the landscaping efforts
that have been made to cope with the extremes of climate that will be of
more lasting interest and value. Visitors will probably sense how hard it is
for contemporary international architecture to reflect national values. The
memory they take away will be of trees and fountains and perhaps the
brooding presence of Japan.

FT  15 APR 92 / Survey of Seville and World Expo '92 (12): Inhale jasmine
sense the past - Tom Burns in the hidden city
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CONNOISSEURS of Seville descend on it throughout the year to sip a chilled
fino, to inhale jasmine and orange blossom, to look at art treasures and to
sense the past. The current hype about the city might put them off visiting
it until the universal show is all over and that could be a mistake.
The Expo months when everybody, starting with the locals, is packed into the
Isla de la Cartuja's Exhibition zone until four in the morning, ought to be
the best time to rendezvous with the half as old as time Seville that knows
nothing and cares less about electronic visual displays.
Instead of boarding an Expo-bound bus on the River Guadalquivir's embankment
by the drum-shaped Torre del Oro watchtower, such visitors should cross the
Paseo de Colon boulevard to the newly built Maestranza opera house and
stroll into the city heading towards the Cathedral.
There will be a Zefirelli production of Don Giovanni at the Maestranza in
September and doubtlessly there will be many more to come in the years
ahead. Those who really want to meet the role model for the Mozart-Da Ponte
hero should visit the Hospital de la Caridad which lies just behind the
opera house.
Built as an old people's home in 1645, the Hospital's cool courtyard has all
Seville's decorative bags of tricks - geranium pots, glazed tiles, stucco,
and pastel strips of ochre and bull's blood on blindingly whitewashed walls.
Its adjoining church drips with baroque ornateness.
The building was endowed by the original Don Giovanni, an aristocratic hell
raiser and womaniser called Miguel de Manara who became a charitable
benefactor after narrowly surviving one of his endless duels or (according
to another version) the death of his long suffering pious wife.
Never one to do things by halves, Manara founded a religious order called
the Very Humble Brotherhood whose principal job was to bury the city's
paupers and its executed criminals. The Hospital, where he is buried, was
Manara's chief legacy and two Valds Leal pictures in the Hospital's church
were the weird emblems of the reformed rake's regained paradise.
Valds Leal, a Sevillian contemporary of Velazquez, Zurbaran and Murillo, was
commissioned by Manara to paint death with all the trimmings. His rendering
of rotting flesh and crumbling earthy goods, of worms and maggots, is an
astonishing allegory of the obsession with decay that marked the baroque
period in general and Sevilla in particular.
There are more art treasures and sensations in the Cathedral, a power
statement if ever there was one, and in the Reales Alcazares, the nearby
Moorish palace where all is languid lightness after the Cathedral's gothic
gloom. Later Christian kings added extensively to the palace and to its
gardens but they retained, even improved upon, the sherbet sparkle that the
first emirs built into their home.
There are scents aplenty in these gardens and they lead the visitor by the
nose into the Barrio de Santa Cruz, Seville's pueblo within a city
neighbourhood that lies beyond the walls of the Reales Alcazares. In the
heart of the Barrio, the plaza de los Venerables is most Seville lovers'
favourite bijou square.
Occupying one of the plaza's facades, the Venerables building, once a home
for retired Cathedral canons, has recently been restored to serve as an
exhibition centre. It has a stunning columned patio built around a fountain
that is driven, Moorish-style, into the ground. The ubiquitous Valds Leal
decorated the chapel.
On one corner of the plaza de los Venerables, the Casa Romn has smoked hams
swinging from its roofbeams, period Sevillian pictures on the walls, sawdust
on the floor, platters of tapas spreadeagled around the bar and ice cold
fino on tap. There are umpteen such places in Seville but a good one for
more sipping and nibbling close by is the Bar las Teresas which stands on
Calle Teresa, the street where Murillo lived and died.
Las Teresas has the inevitable bullfight photographs, glazed tiles and hams
overhead. It also has a good-looking big wall clock which must have been
locally manufactured. The clock has 'Sevilla' engraved on its face and it
makes a telling point about the city's sense of pace for it has been stopped
at 11 o'clock since as far back as anyone can remember.
Nobody need be a Seville connoisseur to think of walking through the Barrio
de Santa Cruz late at night when the moon hangs from the Cathedral's Giralda
tower and purposefully getting lost among whitewashed alleyways and intimate
plazas, dodging past orange trees, brushing against the hanging jasmine and
avoiding the thorns of the bougainvillea creepers.
But veteran Seville hands usually end up in a drinking haunt of old called
Abades which has no welcoming sign on its great coffered doors. It is a 17th
century town mansion that lies on Calle Abades number 13, just between the
Barrio de Santa Cruz and the Cathedral.
Sedately chic with decadent undertones, Abades is where people drink and
chat into the early morning and reassure themselves that in Seville they are
zillions of miles from anywhere, Expo '92 included.

FT  15 APR 92 / Survey of Seville and World Expo '92 (9): Short cuts to a
happy visit - Practical hints on the art of surviving Expo

How long to stay? The organisers say that the conscientious Expo '92 visitor
will need 100 hours to 'do' it properly. Promoters of such events are honour
bound to make such claims. But in the case of this Universal Exposition, the
biggest ever staged, the boast is not so wild.
There is a truly daunting amount to see and sample. A total of 110 nations
are taking part. The previous Universal Exposition was set by Osaka, Japan,
in 1970 when there were 77 participating countries.
Those who are painstakingly thorough should therefore take out a Pta30,000
(Dollars 300) season ticket for the show's six-month duration and spread
their visit.
By the end they might never want to be within a 100-hour radius of anything
that calls itself a multi-media experience or that mentions the word
'discovery' in its promotional blurb.
Others will find the three-day Pta10,000 pass more than sufficient. Only the
'if it's Tuesday it must be Seville, Spain' brigade will want to go for the
one-day Pta4,000 ticket. Over-65s and children aged five-14 will pay
Pta1,500 for a day ticket and the under-fives get in free.
Those who just want to party in Seville during the coming months should note
that a Pta1,000 Expo Noche ticket will give them the run of the exhibition
zone between 8pm and 4am. They will also have two hours in which to see some
of the pavilions before these close at 10pm.
A Pta10,000 Expo Noche season ticket will keep the the ravers fiesta-ing
after-hours from April to October. They, too, might never want to hear
flamenco hand clapping, salsa or Caribbean steel bands for a very long time.
Choice of accommodation: Seville's hotel prices have gone through the roof.
Travel agents will normally be booking for their clients through an Expo
organisation called Coral which controls most of the hotel beds in the city.
The cost is quite exorbitant.
Those not prepared to be fleeced by a three-star hotel which has doubled its
rates to charge Dollars 200 a night should head for the Costa del Sol, drive
inland from Seville to the neighbouring city of Cordoba, or get out of Spain
altogether and into Portugal's far more reasonably priced Algarve resorts.
There is plenty of accommodation within, at most, a 2 1/2 -hour drive from
Expo.
Coral has also organised a bed-and-breakfast network in Seville private
homes and acts as a clearing agency for local camping sites.
What must not be missed: The must exhibits are the theme pavilions. One of
them, which was dubbed Expo's Time Machine and dealt with discoveries over
the past 500 years, was gutted by fire in February. But four remain to take
visitors from a pre-renaissance and pre-Columbus world to a space travel
future. In the middle of it all there is a recreation of Seville's 16th
century harbour, the port that monopolised the yellow brick road to El
Dorado.
Anything between 10,000 to 20,000 souls are expected at the theme pavilions
every day. They will encounter a combination of light and sound, of laser
projections and films, of humans and robots, of interactive things to play
with and things to look at, of objects and artefacts that will be both
genuine and reproduced.
The organisers promise a 'new exhibiting philosophy' that is described as 'a
far cry from traditional museum norms'. The emphasis is on 'atmosphere and
metaphor', on 'communication and participation'.
Those who shy away from such venues should find solace in the adjoining
botanical and tropical gardens where the electronic world will be noticeable
by its absence. These gardens contain 1,000 plant species, nearly half of
them from Latin America
Certain national pavilions, undoubtedly Japan, Italy and Spain, will draw
the big crowds. But the undervisited pavilions will also offer unexpected
rewards.
Those who bypass the Swiss pavilion, for example, for fear of gnomes and
cuckoo clocks, will miss a restaurant created by Swiss artist Daniel Spoerri
who was a friend of Andy Warhol.
It has remnants of food glued on to the walls (hygienically lacquered over),
tables covered by half finished meals hanging from the ceiling and a central
fountain made out of 100 meat grinders. The decor may be very un-Swiss but
the food is of the safe fondu variety.
There are contrasts aplenty at Expo. Monaco's pavilion is mostly a
walkthrough aquarium and Saudi Arabia's is furnished by desert sands. Haiti
has brought to Seville the anchor that belonged to Columbus's flag ship, the
Santa Maria. Some 60 security guards will be guarding an original American
Bill of Rights in the US pavilion.
One part of the Expo spectacle is the architectural bravado of the site and
the imaginative use of cooling fountains, water channels and luxuriously
hanging gardens. The other is the non-stop open-air entertainment provided
by street theatre groups and bands.
As dusk falls a daily cavalcade starts up and nightfall is marked by
fireworks and more laser beams in yet another multi-media show, a gigantic
one this time that is staged over the site's main lake. Then, with Expo
Noche, the night-time knees-up gets underway.
After-hours events include film shows of the silver screen's greats for
those who are incapable of moving another inch.
Among the more mind-boggling of Expo's steady stream of statistics is the
promise of 55,000 live performances of one kind or another, the vast
majority of them free, over its six months duration. Some performances are
not free but very much worth paying serious money for.
When Expo is over and done with, Seville should seriously consider renewing
annually the arts festival that it has created in the shadow of the
high-tech extravaganza.
The best time to go: Avoid July and August. These are the months when
Spaniards, like most people, take their holidays and they for certain will
be making a bee-line for Expo. Seville's temperatures in those months will
be anything between 36 deg C (97 deg F) and 44C (111F). Even if the
bioclimatic cooling features of the exhibition zone are all they are cracked
out to be, it will still be incredibly hot.
May and September are Expo's best months from the weather point of view. The
trouble is that a lot of people know that. June is on balance the best bet.
Once in Seville there is no problem reaching Expo for it lies on an island
in the Guadalquivir river that girds the city. Visitors may enter by river
boat, picking up a launch at the Torre del Oro in downtown Seville, by train
on a commuter link with the city's railway station, and by cable cars which
depart directly opposite the Exposition zone and whisk across the river into
the centre of Expo.
Visitors can also walk across one of three stylish new pedestrian bridges
thrown across the Guadalquivir to the island and which are served by the
city's buses.
A slower stroller starting from Seville's cathedral can make the first of
the bridges in less than half an hour.
All entrances to Expo should be approached with reserves of energy, light
clothing and a high degree of tolerance for excitable crowds.

FT  15 APR 92 / Survey of Seville and World Expo '92 (10): A beneficial
conquest - Spanish Viewpoint / Pilar Cambria argues that Spain should feel
pride, rather than shame, at its record of colonisation in Latin America
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PILAR CAMBRIA
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR the past 18 months public debate about 1492 and all that has dwelt
excessively on the guilt that Spaniards are expected to feel over their role
in Latin America.
There is no calm debate about the implications of the discovery of America,
simply an insistence that things would have been better all round if on
October 13, 1492, after a day's rest on the island which he called San
Salvador, Columbus had simply turned round and gone home.
However, the Spaniards who found America were motivated by three things that
we have never tried to hide - idealism, economic necessity, and a scientific
curiosity about geographic theory.
Of course, among the Discoverers there were psychotics worthy of attention
by Sigmund Freud as well as cruel and greedy men. But there were no
professional exterminators.
It is absurd to assume that Hernan Cortez had genocide in mind as he moved
into huge and unknown Mexico with an army of 200 footsoldiers, 15 horsemen
and 1,500 friendly Indians.
In the eyes of the great Aztec Empire, Cortez and his cast must have
resembled a line of ants that August of 1519. Pizarro did not take many more
troops with him to the Peru of the Incas, who numbered 20m.
Reading Bernal Diaz del Castillo, one of Cortes' soldiers and the best
reporter of the times, the Discoverers seem like wide-eyed Indiana Joneses,
constantly amazed by new worlds, new cultures and new adventures.
And how quickly they did their work. By 1550, only 58 years after Columbus's
navigational 'mistake', the American continent had been mapped in detail
from the Rio Grande to Tierra del Fuego. After Europe it was easily the best
documented continent.
As both technocrats and idealists, the Discoverers knew exactly what they
had to do. If the hostility of the Mayas, the Incas, the Aztecs or the Carib
Indians demanded war, then they fought. But their objective was not war but
to claim new souls for their God and land and riches for their Kings. They
were not choosy about the prizes either. Gold and silver were valued, but so
were Andean llamas, tobacco, tomatoes and potatoes. And there were no slaves
among that booty.
The Spanish and Portuguese coined a new verb in Mexico and in central and
South America - colonizar (to colonise). But it would soon become common
usage by the other European powers as well.
Spain and Portugal, a historian has written, 'sent to America handpicked
subjects - not groups of prisoners  - who created families, homes and cities
and rebuilt there the same laws as in the mother country. They went to
America because they had found it but also with the blessing of the Catholic
Church justifying occupation if it was accompanied by evangelising. And in
those days to evangelise was to civilise.'
So the Spaniards went, and gave political and administrative identity to
their American territories; as a civilising vehicle they used a common
language, Castilian, and they educated Whites and Indians in the same
schools and universities from the beginning of the 16th century. They
eliminated polygamy, cannibalism and human sacrifice.
Spaniards took to America their ways of loving and believing, of hoping, of
dreaming and of dying. And they did it in the only easy and efficient way -
el mestizaje (crossbreeding).
Today, 55 per cent of the population of Mexico is mestiza. The union, which
did not result from wholesale rape, began quickly. An Indian woman became
Hernan Cortes' closest companion during his Mexican adventure and he is said
to have loved her passionately.
We Spanish do not expect much praise for having invented this humane form of
colonisation. Crossbreeding is, for us, quite natural, and we were not doing
anything in America that other peoples had not done for centuries in other
places.
It is easy to criticise October 12, 1492 and its consequences. But the
Discovery meant the beginning of a new trade route, new colonies and a new
cultural frontier. For those already there - Mayas, Incas, Caribs and Aztecs
 -it constituted a great leap forward from Prehistory to Modernity. Sooner
or later, America would have had to make that leap.
Many people say that all this history simply boils down to the meeting of
two cultures: on the sands of Guahani Columbus and his crews were astonished
at the stiff hair of the Indians and, upon seeing them nude, pitied their
'poverty'. The Indians, for their part, were intrigued by the beards of the
Spanish and cut their fingers on their swords.
Five hundred years later, the cultures of Spain and America still throw up
remarkable encounters; a few months ago the foremost conservative leader in
Spain, Manuel Fraga Iribarne, was in Cuba, where he embraced Fidel Castro,
the last and most recalcitrant exponent of Marxist Leninism in the
Caribbean.
Five centuries after the Discovery, I fully endorse the judgment of the
historian Arnold Toynbee:
'I admire the work done by the Spanish Crown and by the Catholic Church in
this vast region. I admire the Crown for having kept the conquistadores
under control. The conquistadores were greedy, cruel and revolting. They
were also brave.
'They were, therefore, formidable. And I admire both, the Crown and the
Church, for having treated the natives as human beings and for trying to
protect them.'

filled his sails - The Europe in which Columbus launched his great adventure

NO-ONE should belittle Spain's determination to make the world recognise
1992 as a turning point in its modern history.
The Spanish regard their homeland as Western Europe's last frontier. Five
hundred years ago it still remained undecided whether their portion of the
Iberian Peninsula formed the northernmost outpost of Africa or the
south-western extremity of Christendom. Spain was located on the wrong side
of the Pyrenees.
More, it had been occupied by the Moslems too long, in parts for almost 800
years. And who ruled Spain? Kings or cardinals or robber knights or the
Hermandad, the powerful organisation of 'brotherhoods' that originated as a
militia policing the regions and doubled as a national tax-collecting
agency? But times were ready for change when IsabelIa of Castile married
Ferdinand of Aragon in 1469, against strong popular feeling in both states
and while neither was as yet a crowned head. The financing of Ferdinand's
suit, quite beyond the capacity of his bankrupt father King John of Aragon,
was provided by Jewish financiers in the royal employ, acting in collusion
with a Catalan official of the Vatican, the future Borgia Pope Alexander VI.
IsabelIa was 18, Ferdinand a year younger. Unlike Portugal, which prospered
by espousing the Atlantic as a second province, Spain was an unmade bed.
Much of Andalucia in the south still remained Moslem territory. The
Reconquista, called a crusade, was not yet completed in 1491. Concentration
on the mission had created an inward-looking Spanish people of passionate
intensity.
This was accompanied by intermarriage on a scale to make it difficult to
discern whether an individual was of Christian or Hebrew or Arab descent.
A mountainous land dry as dust bred a dogged population attached to their
patch. This national introspection goes some way to account for the ferocity
of the Civil War in the 20th century which cost three quarters of a million
lives, and the fact that Spain kept out of this century's two great European
conflagrations.
The voyage of Christopher Columbus as a Spanish enterprise owed nothing to
the young monarchs' empire-building desires. They had no such ambition. The
man from Genoa had peddled his proposition to a succession of rulers, but
without success. He first appealed to King John of Portugal, only to be
rebuffed. Columbus next approached Isabella and Ferdinand, again being
refused. Then, in desperation, he besought the brilliant Regent of France,
Anne of Beaujeu; and finally Henry VII of England.
None was interested. They exhausted their wealth in battles over ownership
of a town, or a river, or a forest within Europe. But they were deaf to the
concept of a second shore to the Atlantic where, according to Columbus,
realms beyond dreams were available for the taking.
He returned to Spain, waiting impatiently outside the royal headquarters
during the protracted campaign against Granada. Years passed before the
Queen's advisers, notably the baptised Jew Luis de Santangel, persuaded her
to grant Columbus her patronage. What had she to lose, they urged, with a
negligible gamble of three tiny caravels? They had just hoisted the royal
standard, together with a huge silver cross given by the Pope, on the
Alhambra, the defeated Moorish kingdom's architectural masterpiece.
Because Columbus stole the historic moment for his perilous adventure into
the unknown, the immense strategic achievement in closing the Straits of
Gibraltar against exit by Ottoman fleets remained for a time unremarked. It
was as crucial to the future of the European races as the annexation of
America. The Catholic monarchs had thereby locked the Sultan of Turkey
within the Mediterranean.
Had the Sublime Porte been able to pass its ships into the Atlantic it could
well have encircled this continent. Turkey was already master of the greater
portion of south-eastern Europe. Western countries lay unprotected on their
oceanic side, the Portuguese being too few to engage a major enemy. France
was preoccupied with internal consolidation and in eternal dispute with
others over the Low Countries, while England had not yet recovered from the
wounds of the Hundred Years War or the Wars of the Roses.
To be sure, Turkey may not have succeeded in replacing Christianity with
Islam in Europe, but physical control was all the Crescent aspired to, as in
the Balkans. Ventures deep into the Atlantic would then have been automatic,
with the New World doubtless given another conqueror and a different
history. Moslem mariners were no less skilled than the European, as witness
their navigation of the Indian Ocean as far as the Malabar coast. Portuguese
ships hugged the western shores of Africa but had not as yet properly
rounded the Cape.
Amazingly, Europe itself, when Columbus planted Isabella's banner on the
Arawak island he baptised San Salvador on October 12, 1492, counted no more
than as a mere promontory hanging precariously over the ledge of Asia.
Europe comprised a jigsaw of statelets torn by perennial strife.
Eastwards, Europe was ever dangerously exposed to a resolute predator.
Following the conquest of Constantinople in 1453 there seemed no stopping
the Turk. He would reach the outskirts of Vienna in 1519, to hold the
Austrian capital in siege for a further century and a half. He had swallowed
Hungary and threatened Poland, while Muscovy had only recently shaken off
Tatar tutelage.
Only in 1571 did Spain, now the greatest European power, manage to clip the
Sultan's sails at Lepanto in Greek waters, where Cervantes lost an arm. The
long retreat and decline of the Ottomans on land had not yet begun.
Returning to the annus mirabilis of 1492, we find the young Ferdinand mostly
apathetic to Columbus and the consequences of a new continent joined to
Spain. Ownership of the colonies came specifically to Isabella's Castile.
Ferdinand was busy scheming his way into the possession of the southern half
of Italy. A minor princeling on his marriage, he founded a dynasty destined
for the ultimate tiara available to a European monarch - the crown of the
Holy Roman Empire. Of the offspring from his union with Isabella two girls
survived - the demented Joanna and the unhappy Katharine, first wife of
Henry VIII.
Joanna proved the vessel in which the great design was consummated. Her
marriage to a Habsburg produced Charles V, the king-emperor reigning over
half of Europe and extensive dominions across the world. The last of his
line, Dr. Otto von Habsburg, has renounced all claims to a throne and today
sits in the European parliament as a representative of Bavaria.
So is this the picture to set the scene for the Quincentenary? Crowns lost,
empires rising and declining, a theatre of global proportions with entire
populations observing the spectacle? Hardly. The year 1492 heralded the
Europeans' domination of the rest not only by the prerogative of conquest
but also through the sinews of trade and the spirit of the Renaissance.
Commerce reached global dimensions with the overseas acquisitions of the two
Iberian powers east and west. The world's abundance funnelled into Lisbon
and Seville, eclipsing Venice in the process. Lombard and Flemish bankers
lubricated the system and promoted Antwerp to Europe's premier metropolis.
Capitalism came into its own.
Peruvian silver soon flooded into Europe to create new money markets and
destabilise currencies. Within 100 years both Portugal and Spain faltered,
losing their capability to sustain their distant possessions. The field
cleared for successor empires, English, French and Dutch.
Simultaneously, Europeans began exploring new frontiers of the mind. The
Renaissance might be described as a rediscovery by man of his own emotional
creativity. Out of Italy, impotent plaything of Franco-Spanish rivalries,
the shoots grew into a dazzling cultural and intellectual harvest. This
began in Tuscany, more exactly Medicean Florence, then spread throughout
western Europe.
European philosophers, artists and theologians dared to challenge a doctrine
that pronounced every human endeavour to be directed by God's will, unless
foiled by the Anti-Christ. Thomas More's Utopia, published in 1516, was
inspired by news of a virgin civilisation across the Atlantic to advance the
idea of a state based on social justice, tolerance of all religions.
The work exerted a profound influence on some clerics, among them Bartolome
de Las Casas, a friar domiciled in Mexico, who had the ear of the Emperor
Charles V. In consequence of Las Casas' agitation against his
fellow-colonists for their inhuman treatment of their slaves, Charles
ordered stringent rules to protect the surviving Indian tribes - too late,
unhappily, to avoid a genocidal catastrophe.
Current attitudes induce a cynicism regarding the intentions of Columbus,
and Spain, in bringing European religion, with its social and cultural
mores, to corrupt the innocents of the new territories. We protest too much.
Three hundred years after the Discoverer sailed, and with the American War
of Independence and the French Declaration of the Rights of Man already
history, Britain began a colonisation of Australia. The result for the
aboriginal population there equalled that earlier epoch of expropriation
drenched with slaughter.

age - The Semitic Heritage

WITH the curtain about to rise on Expo '92 at Seville, Spain intends a tour
de force bridging ancient splendours with the promise of an auspicious
future, writes BARNET LITVINOFF.
But first a stigma had to be expunged, for Seville and the Quincentenary
recall not only the epic of Columbus but also the historic crimes
perpetrated upon the two proud communities that shared this homeland with
the Christians.
Three developments in quick succession followed each other in the early days
of January 1492:
the last Moorish kingdom ceased to exist;
Columbus received the official sponsorship he had sought so long;
and professing Jews were given the alternatives of conversion or departure
from Spanish dominion.
Influential Jews, notably Abraham Senior, the Crown Rabbi of Castile, and
the 'converso' Luis de Santangel, Treasurer of the Royal household and the
man who persuaded Isabella to grant Columbus her assent, employed every
argument to annul the edict.
In vain. Catholic hysteria swept the land on Granada's extinction. The
decree was to take effect on March 31 with four months grace allowed for the
people to liquidate their affairs.
In the event, some 150,000 Jews departed, of whom about 20,000 (the very
poor, of course) disappeared in transit, either dying of starvation or sold
into slavery. Senior himself led 50,000 or so into the Church, the king and
queen standing as godparents at his baptism.
Off went the Jews, the majority in temporary sojourn, at a price of eight
cruzados per head, to Portugal. A warm welcome awaited many others in Turkey
and the Low Countries, where they revived their fortunes.
The expulsion of the Jews in 1492 coincided with the institution of a
regimen of brutal oppression against the Moors, until they too were driven
out of Spain in 1609. Theirs was a lingering agony of persecution with the
proscription of the Arabic language, until they too were expelled in 1609.
Some 275,000 Hispanic Moslems took to the Maghreb.
The Jewish presence in Spain dated back to Roman times; the Arabs to AD 711.
Both Semitic races had produced philosophers, scientists and poets to cross
the divide separating east and west.
Little wonder that the present government of Spain felt honoured to host the
first direct negotiation between Israelis and Arabs last year.
By a paradox, all three peoples, Catholics, Moslems and Jews, before their
incompatibility was declared, cohabited in relative harmony for many
centuries. In contrast with their golden age of science and culture, the
rest of Europe dwelt in a medieval chiaroscuro rife with lawlessness and
illiteracy. While Toledo gave the hallmark to Jewish achievement, Seville on
the banks of the Guadalquivir rivalled Granada and Cordoba in grace and
purposeful activity.
Toledo is being reclaimed as a cultural and spiritual centre for Sephardic
Jewry, while Seville (in Arabic Ishbiliya) will extend a welcome to scholars
from the Islamic world.
Seville was the principal port of the Spanish-American connection and
enjoyed the monopoly of all Atlantic trade for 200 years following the
expedition of Columbus. One might have thought, therefore, that this city
and its hinterland would have flourished ever afterwards. But Seville's
prosperity, attracting entrepreneurs from all Europe, could not endure.
Situated deeply inland on the river, it suffered a gradual silting and the
spread of marsh. Cadiz supplanted Seville as the leading port early in the
18th century, precisely as Antwerp stole the role from Bruges in earlier
days.
Seville's present population of 700,000 is half the size of Cadiz.
Nevertheless the authorities hope to revive its fortunes by renewing the
Ibero-American bond which gave the city its unique position in mercantile
history. Expo '92 is making the association with Latin America one of its
major concerns. In this it includes Portuguese-speaking Brazil and the
proliferation of Hispanics in the US. Transatlantic investment is being
encouraged as well as cultural exchanges and, of course, more visits from
the general public. Spain believes it will thus bring an extra dimension to
its participation in Europe.
One Spanish characteristic is a preoccupation with the national past, almost
a neurosis. The Inquisition was inaugurated in Seville in 1478, originally
against Papal opposition: this cruellest of tribunals - hands chopped from
the 'guilty' preceded the consignment of living men and women to the pyre -
was not directed against Jews and Moslems who openly professed their faith.
By Catholic doctrine they were doomed for perdition anyway.
The Inquisition sought out heretics, mainly converted Jews who, having
accepted baptism, were believed to be practising their Hebraic rites in
secret. A person (and they included Catholic priests) might be arraigned on
the strength of information brought to the tribunal by an aggrieved servant,
even an estranged relative. There indeed existed such closet Jews (closet
Moslems were much fewer) who proclaimed their true identity and followed the
overtly orthodox into exile on the Edict of Expulsion in 1492.
Superstition has it that a curse was laid upon Seville as the place where in
1480 the Inquisition was begun in Spain. It was also established in Portugal
and subsequently in the colonies overseas, surviving, with chastisement of
Protestants, too, until 1820. King Juan Carlos has just joined hands with
the President of Israel at a service of reconciliation in Madrid's
synagogue: atonement for the infamy of his ancestors.
So be it. Jews have not forgotten that General Franco, a fascist dictator,
refrained from joining Nazi Germany in the Second World War, and protected
refugees succeeding in finding a haven across the Pyrenees.

MEXICO'S tortured feelings about its conquest by Spain and relations with
the once colonial power have been sorely tested by the celebrations of
Columbus's 'discovery' of the Americas.
Almost as soon as the Spaniards formed their preparatory committee to
organise the celebration, Mexicans and other Latin Americans objected. The
Americas were not discovered, they pointed out - rather there was a 'meeting
of two worlds'. The 500th anniversary, they said, should not be a
celebration, but a commemoration.
Even this is too benign a description for many. The brutal conquest of
Mexico and the subsequent annihilation (through disease) of most of the
indigenous population, could hardly be described as a 'meeting'. In Mexico,
indigenous leaders will celebrate 'the day of the race' (as it is called) by
taking wreaths from the statue of Columbus and laying them at the foot of
the last Aztec Emperor, Cuauhtemoc.
Mexico's ambassador to Spain, Jesus Silva Herzog, in a recent interview with
the newspaper La Journada, went to some considerable effort to explain
Mexico's position: 'Our pavilion in the Seville fair is going to show the
world that Mexico did not begin in 1492, that before the Spanish arrived we
were already an important group of nations, with a city, Tenochtitlan, that
was probably larger than whatever European city of that era. And now we
desire and hope to place ourself in a world forum with a dynamic project,
equally multiethnic, multiracial, multicultural, that shows we are more than
30 centuries old, and not a mere 500 years old.'
Such defensiveness is understandable. The typical Mexican when asked about
Hernan Cortes, who conquered Aztec Mexico with a few hundred soldiers, will
say he was a brutal blood-thirsty mercenary - far from the hero many in
Spain portray him to be. While in Peru statutes of their conqueror,
Francisco Pizarro, abound, Mexico City sports none of Cortes.
Mexico's attitude to the 500th anniversary is complicated by the hope many
Mexican intellectuals have that it will force the country to confront its
colonial past, and come to terms with its mestizaje (mixed-blood heritage).
Carlos Fuentes, the writer, has renewed an old controversy by suggesting the
city build a statute to Cortes. As he said 'I wish we could have a statue of
Hernan Cortes on his horse so that we could end the complex of having been
colonised. I believe this is more honest; we must accept our mother and
father.'
Such views are echoed by other intellectuals, who, as a group, form a
strangely important role in Mexican society. In a television debate on the
meaning of 1492, Enrique Florescano, a respected historian, made an
impassioned plea. 'The (historical) interpretations that developed during
the period of Mexican nationalism cut off our colonial past; the result is
we have not been able to incorporate the huge impact of its politics,
religion, culture and science on our history, which has created an identity
crisis. We have to use their 500th anniversary to re-evaluate our history.'
Others present disagreed, claiming Mexico has a perfectly strong sense of
national identity. Mr Fuentes's proposal has similarly been roundly
condemned. The philosopher Leopoldo Zea called the idea 'an offence and act
of idolatry'. The writer Carlos Monsivais joined the fray saying 'it is one
thing to suppress unnecessary quarrels, and quite another to provoke them
with stone and bronze'.
Indigenous peoples (about 10 per cent of the population), and perhaps a
majority of the mestizos (mixed-bloods) are understandably concerned that a
statue to Cortes would symbolically suggest approval for his brutal
conquest, and primacy for the Spanish part of the country's heritage.
Mexico's confused relationship with Cortes (and by implication with its
mixed-blood heritage) has had a profound effect on its relations with Spain.
For most of the 19th century relations were frosty, as Mexico struggled to
assert its independence. In the 20th century Mexico broke off relations with
General Franco's Spain, and welcomed some 40,000 republican exiles to its
shores. Alan Riding in his book Distant Neighbours writes (going perhaps too
far) that Franco 'had come to signify Cortes' who by breaking off of
relations 'could be symbolically punished'.
Since then Mexico and Spain have grown closer, especially under Felipe
Gonzalez and Carlos Salinas de Gortari. Members of Mr Salinas's cabinet are
said to be deeply impressed by Spain's 'transition' since Franco's death,
and are keen to emulate a similar type of transition themselves - even if
Mexico's situation is strikingly different. Hence, just as Spain joined the
European Community in the belief that economic integration would fuel
growth, capital inflows, and promote political stability, Mexico has sought
membership of a North American free trade area for similar reasons.
Spain has recently replaced France as Mexico's closest political partner in
the EC. Mr Gonzalez and President Salinas have cooperated closely over
policy to Cuba, while Spain offered help during the El Salvador peace talks.
(In the early 1980s, by contrast, France and Mexico had cooperated closely
over Central American policy.) Spain, eager to make up for past insults, has
showered Mexico (and the rest of Latin America) with trade credits, and
promises of cooperation.
The annual Ibero-American summit, held last year for the first time in
Mexico, and to be hosted this year in Spain, aims to strengthen these links
still further. Mexico and Latin America hope (rather forlornly) that Spain
will promote its interests in the European Community, just as Britain and
France won trade concessions for former colonies.
Spain in turns wants to build a foothold in the import-hungry Latin American
economies. Already Spain's airline, Iberia, has become an Ibero-American
carrier, with stakes in the airlines of Venezuela and Argentina. Two Spanish
banks have bought stakes in Mexican banks; Spanish investment in Cuban
tourism is vital to the island's battered economy.
But in spite of the rhetoric of Ibero-American integration, the chances of
deeper cooperation are limited. Spain's future clearly lies in Europe, and
it is much too concerned about becoming a first-rank member of the EC to
waste energy on promoting Latin America to other countries. Indeed, Spain's
investment in Mexico is behind that of France, Germany, Japan, Switzerland
and the UK, suggesting, if anything, Spain could learn from other European
countries about doing business amongst its former colonies.
Similarly, the future of Latin America (Cuba apart) evidently lies with the
US. The US political and commercial presence is and always will be
substantially larger than Spain's. In Mexico, for example, accumulated
Spanish investment up to August 1991 was a paltry Dollars 726m, compared to
the US investment of Dollars 20.7bn. In recognition of the economic reality,
Mexico, and the rest of Latin America, are queueing up to form free trade
agreements with the US. Spain lags far behind in their priorities.

wreckage - Medieval palaces are being restored

MANY visitors to the Expo over the next six months will want to stay to see
the older sites of a city that still has a remarkable beauty and a very
distinctive architecture.
But they will have to look hard for a sense of the past in a city that has,
more than many of the other great cities of southern Spain, already suffered
the ravages of the late 20th century. Compare Seville with the more intact
cities of Cordoba or Granada and the differences are sadly obvious.
Looking back at old engravings of Seville and even early photographs of the
19th century and there is a city intact behind medieval walls with tall
towers and great gates. Today, those walls have gone and the visitor to Expo
will have to search hard for ancient Seville. The reopening of the river and
canal system of the Guadalquivir in 1971 brought visual disaster as well as
industrial blessings to the city.
It is hard to believe that Triana on the left bank of the river was once as
picturesque as Rome's Trastevere or Florence's Oltranto. Seville's suburbs
are featureless and the high rise blocks of the Los Remedios area have
damaged much of the skyline.
Tourists naturally flock to the great gothic cathedral where Columbus is
presumed to lie in his giant sarcophagus. Around the cathedral in the small
streets and gardens of the Barrio de Santa Cruz the visitor can find
something of the old atmosphere that is strongly Moorish. Narrow streets of
whitewashed houses lead to the shaded courtyards, filled in summer with
orange blossom, roses and the heavy scent of lilies.
But do not be too taken in by this area because many of the streets that
lead to the Plaza Santa Maria and the Plaza de Dona Elvira were entirely
rebuilt as recently as 1924. The real Barrio lies beyond this area of
pastiche, from Santa Maria la Blanca to Plaza de las Mercerias. Here the
visitor will still find the 17th century palaces of the Dukes of Bejar and
the Marques de Marchelina.
There are also churches incorporating the remains of mosques such as San
Esteban and if you look hard there are relics of Roman buildings that are
now parts of much later structures. The interesting thing about this area is
that right up to the 19th century builders followed the rules - tall
windows, iron balconies and cool enclosed courts.
It was the development of the tower blocks of Los Remedios that caused the
emptying of much of this quarter and led to its decay. This movement of
population from the inner city coincided with planning laws passed during
the Franco era which favoured speculation and led to excessive demolition
and insensitive redevelopment.
There was a reaction in Seville to the steady erosion of the older parts of
the inner city, largely led by an organisation called Pro Sevilla. The
initiative came mainly from the Duke of Segorbe who drew up a charter to
encourage the participation of many of the leading Spanish banks including
the Banco Hispano-Americano and the Banco Occidental.
The Duke of Segorbe's family, the Medinaceli, played an important part in
the history of Seville and their palace - the Casa de Pilatos  - is one of
the city's most beautiful places.
Pro Sevilla was unusual in the world of conservation because it set out to
be commercial and to show that investment in real estate need not be
incompatible with the conservation and careful urban renewal. In the early
1980s the organisation owned some 130 buildings in the areas of San
Bartolome and Santiago. Some of these decaying houses and tenements were
restored by Pro Sevilla itself, using traditional methods right down to old
limewash techniques for painting the walls to ensure that they fade to the
right colour.
One of the most recently completed restoration and renewal projects is the
creation of an apartment hotel known as Las Casas de la Juderia, in a
section of the city that was for a long period home to the Jews. Many of the
houses belonged to the Duke de Bejar and were palatial in scale. The
conversion of this particular hotel shows that it is entirely possible to
keep the best of the old and refurbish it so that it is a commercial
proposition. Particularly well done are the internal arcaded courtyard
gardens. Each apartment has either a courtyard or a terrace and the
interiors are very sympathetically decorated.
The restoration work of Pro Sevilla is exceptional because the organisation
does not believe in the creation of pastiche architecture. Instead it
commissions new elements for older buildings from the best contemporary
architects. One tiny 16th century barber shop on Plaza de San Lorenzo
(perhaps the haunt of Figaro himself?) is now a house with a spectacular
modern interior. The Italian architect Aldo Rossi was commissioned to carry
out the conversion of the Corral del Conde - his design to turn this
building into flats is modern but conforms in scale and fenestration to its
neighbours.
Throughout Seville this year the example of Pro Sevilla seems to be catching
on and there is a mass of scaffolding, building repair and cleaning. Behind
the restored facade are new spaces for work and leisure that demonstrate the
vitality of the old city. The political decision to pour money into the
Seville region for Expo has benefited both old and new parts of the city.
These funds cannot rebuild the medieval city but they are helping to retain
the best of old Seville and give it new life.

indifferent - The People of Seville

WHEN the bullfighter Rafael Gomez 'El Gallo' returned from an exhausting
tour of South America to the Northwestern port of La Coruna he was reputedly
impatient to get home to Seville.
'Seville is a long way away, Rafael,' his friends told him. 'Seville is
where it ought to be,' said the matador. 'What's far away is this place.'
That was in the pre-World War One days of long transatlantic crossings and
slow steam engines. Seville now has a huge airport and a high speed train
but the attitude of its native sons has not visibly changed: the city
remains the centre of their universe and they are not particularly curious
about what lies beyond it.
Such thinking means that Universal Expositions don't count for all that much
in Seville. At best Expo '92 is a welcome, but in no way imperative,
addition to the city. At worst it is an imposition.
Seville, the most class-ridden and laidback big city in Spain, has evolved a
rhythm of its own. Its Holy Week religious processions, which will take
place the week before Expo opens, and its annual Feria, which starts its
blitzkrieg of fino drinking, flamenco dancing and corrida rituals a week
after the Exposition's inauguration, are far more important events.
The city is fussy about form although it is often short on content.
Modernity and innovation arouse suspicions and all hype that is not
associated with the madonnas at Holy Week or with an idolised matador during
the Feria bullfights is considered bad form.
Disneyland happenings are distinctly ersatz for a society that takes pride
in what it describes as its 'baroque' world view and that believes utterly
in duende, a word that literally means ghost and which suggests rarefied
behaviour.
Sevillians are turned on by a high stepping horse, by the grace with which a
gypsy dancer moves her arms and by the stylishness that a young blood
employs at Feria time to tilt his broad brimmed hat over his right eyebrow.
The sheer size and scope of Expo doesn't impress the locals. They know all
about that because, amongst other things, their cathedral, which was built
nearly a century before Columbus's landfall in the New World, is quite vast.
'Let us build a church so enormous that everyone who looks at it will take
us for madmen,' announced the Cathedral's chapter as they laid down its
first stone. Sevillians relish telling that story.
The present day city mayor, Alejandro Rojas Marcos, has provided a lead in
the local refusal to be overawed by the great event. He complains that Expo
has been built 'without taking Seville into account' and, up to the last
moment, he has been a headache to its organisers.
Recently he demanded that Pta2bn should be paid from the state budget into
Seville's municipal coffers as compensation for the disruption caused to the
city's life by the Exposition. He even threatened to refuse municipal
building licences to Expo pavilions that had already been built, thus in
theory preventing the public from entering them, unless his demand was met.
The mayor is the leader of the Andalucian regional party and, as a long time
opponent of Felipe Gonzalez, the socialist premier and fellow Sevillian, he
can be counted upon to seize every opportunity to embarrass the ruling
party. But his decidedly lukewarm attitude towards Expo is widely shared
locally.
The overwhelming number of those who have made Expo happen, including its
commissioner-general Emilio Cassinello and its chief executive Jacinto
Pellon, are non-Sevillians. Middle ranking officials, drafted in from
Madrid, Bilbao and elsewhere over the past four years to put the show on the
road, often reciprocate with their ambivalent views about Seville society.
Some officials talk about a closed off Seville society that views outsiders
with near hostility. And they confess to extreme frustrations over local
traders and business people who appeared incapable of producing sensible
budgets and of delivering on time. One of the Spainish pavilions decided
early on to have its brochures printed in Madrid and another preferred to
fly in electricians for a day's work.
None of this means that Sevillians won't have the time of their lives for
the next six months thanks to the fact that Expo has landed on their
doorstep.
Tens of thousands poured into the exhibition zone when it held its open days
during the construction phase and they filled it with the infectious sense
of joy that they call alegria. They have snapped up the season ticket passes
and they will certainly turn the Exposition into the biggest fiesta ever
staged.
To satisfy Seville's irrepressible joie de vivre, the organisers have broken
new ground with what is called Expo Noche, an after hours and cut price
schedule of concerts, open air film shows and other attractions that will
last until 4 am. It will undoubtably set new standards for all night
partying. But whether Seville will use the Expo windfall to vault into the
21st century is quite another matter.
Expo will be fun but it is a wholly serious enterprise in as far as it has
been the catalyst for one of the most ambitious regional development efforts
ever undertaken by a European government. Seville has received the finest
communications infrastructure that money can buy.
It could be that Sevillians, with so much of Expo's 'Ages of Discoveries'
drummed into their minds for 176 days, will discover that they have it in
themselves to break out of their ancestral pleasure-seeking lethargy.
But they might echo 'El Gallo' and, deciding that Expo, once over, was
something far away, return to a Seville that will forever remain where it
ought to be.

twinge of envy - Spain is all agog at the scale of the project

EXPO '92 IS, on the face of it, a custom-built super-city with a six-month
life span on a river island alongside Seville. But it is a lot more than
just that and the rest of Spain is muttering as a result.
Barcelona envies Seville its 300kph high speed train link with Madrid; and
Madrid, cursed with a wholly inadequate airport, wonders why Seville's has
passenger terminals quite out of proportion both to its runway facilities
and to its projected traffic.
Valencia, Spain's third city, is upset about both the train link and the
airport and it asks why, as an infinitely busier commercial centre, it has
not been favoured with fibre-optic communications, with 70kms worth of
ringroads and with a dual carriage highway to Madrid.
Spaniards in general would not begrudge Seville a couple of new bridges to
help it straddle its Guadalquivir river. But eight?
Seville's new bridges have doubled the city's existing number and three of
them lead solely to the Expo island. Industrial Bilbao, hemmed in by the
Nervion river, could certainly have done with a few of them.
The government, led by Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez who is Sevillian born
and bred, attempts to silence the mutterers by insisting that Expo is a
modernising vehicle for one of Spain's least favoured regions; that there is
far more to the Exposition than the 'come to the big party' hype would
suggest.
Mr Gonzalez frequently voices fears that Spain's richer areas, near the
French frontier, will surge ahead in a Single Market Europe while the
Southern belt of Andalucia, which lies within sight of Africa, risks a
barren future.
The threat of widening regional imbalances during the 1990s is real enough
and the Prime Minister is determined to prevent his home region decoupling
from the rest of Spain.
Expo thus represents development economics with a vengeance. More than
Pta900bn in the past five years has been pumped by the government into an
area whose GDP is 20 per cent lower than the national average and 54 per
cent of that of the EC.
According to the government's thinking, market forces will improve
Valencia's infrastructure and they will pay for the airport overhaul that is
overdue in Madrid. They will also ensure a bullet train between Madrid and
Barcelona and beyond to the French frontier.
But were it not for Expo no meaningful capital investment, public or
private, would have been lured to Southern Spain. Certainly the high speed
tracks would never have reached Seville.
Now, as Expo prepares to pack in the public, the administration's focus has
uncompromisingly shifted from the Exposition itself to what happens
afterwards to Seville and to Andalucia. There are few worries about the 18m
who are expected to visit Expo. There is more concern over what will occur
at the Exposition site when its last visitor has left.
A project called Cartuja '93, named after the Cartuja island where the
exposition stands, has been set up with the future specifically in mind. It
seeks to fuel the technological development of the region by exploiting the
global promotion that Seville will receive over the next six months and by
re-utilising Expo's infrastructure and equipment.
Funded by the Spanish government with the Andalucia regional executive and
the Seville city council as minority partners, Cartuja '93 is a state
project backed by Spanish and European research bodies including the EC's
Institute for Prospective Technology and the International Centre for
Technology Transfer. According to Expo commissioner-general Emilio
Cassinello, it is 'the most important and ambitious programme' of the whole
1992 extravaganza.
The hoped for scientific and technological complex has been given something
of a start by those Expo participants that have already said they wish to
remain on the site after the show is over. Italy seeks to convert its
pavilion into an industrial design centre and IBM will base a Language
Technology laboratory in its corporate pavilion with the aim of transferring
to Spanish its breakthroughs in voice synthesis and recognition.
Siemens and Rank Xerox are also understood to be studying continued use of
their Expo pavilions and France has announced that its building will stay on
the Cartuja island to house the biggest French cultural and bibliographical
research centre outside Paris.
Mr Rafael de la Cruz, a former senior official in the Spanish Treasury who
was appointed Cartuja '93 chairman last October, says that he remains
'flexible' about the sort of businesses which will be welcomed into the
future park. Much of his work to date has concerned with negotiating the
details of fiscal breaks and other incentives to attract investment.
The project's main promotional effort will start as soon as Expo opens its
doors to the public. 'The six months of the exposition are going to be
fundamental because they will allow us to explain our objectives,' Mr de la
Cruz says. He claims two dozen companies so far have expressed an initial
interest in the park.
The success or failure of Expo '92 will be judged by the subsequent fortunes
of Cartuja '93. Only if the project turns into a genuinely viable scientific
and technological park propelling Andalucia into the 21st century will the
immense investment be justified and the mutterers silenced.

JAPAN HAS a built a four storey wooden pavilion, a massive African teak and
Canadian pine teahouse. It is claimed to be the biggest wooden building ever
erected and not a nail has been used to knock it together.
Japanese salesmanship and ingenuity is omnipresent at the Exposition and the
disarmingly unstressed Japan pavilion is therefore able to emphasise the
concept of Kinari or nature as the fount of all culture. The pavilion
flaunts a society that has gone through the high tech tube and come out the
other side.
Chile has brought along an iceberg. The 60 tonnes worth of freezing mass was
fished off the Antarctic coast before Christmas and arrived in Seville
stored in 10 containers like so many ice cubes for a giant's drink. A 'cold
air curtain' and a system of inner tubes will keep the ice flow healthy in
Chile's futuristic pavilion throughout Seville's soaring summer heat.
Nobody knows what will happen to the iceberg when Expo rings down its
curtain and there are those who recoil at the thought of transporting one to
Southern Europe. But the idea is to impress the public with Chile's frozen
food export potential.
Hungary has reproduced a rural church with seven belfries. Forty aluminium
bells will peel out the same carillon which in 1456 informed the Western
world that the Turkish advance had been stopped at the battle of Belgrade
and that Europe had been saved.
If Hungary had had time and money to experiment with Seville's climatic
conditions it would have packed its pavilion with thousands of chrysalises
and had butterflies hatching by the half hour for the duration of Expo. They
would have symbolised the rebirth of a nation.
It has, instead, installed a fair-sized oak tree in a glass vacuum. Visitors
will walk around the tree, look down through the glass to examine its
spreading roots and perhaps take home the message that bell-ringing Hungary
lies firmly in the Western World.
Expo 92's Commissioner General, Emilio Cassinello, likes to say that the
participants in the great event are paying tribute to 'imaginative
intelligence'. Expo participants have mostly understood the mix of spirit
and brains to be a once in a lifetime opportunity to let themselves go. The
national buildings show off art works and tradition, they display present
day industrial and creative muscle and they project a future of collective
illusions. Most have restaurants, bars serving out the ethnic tipple and
competitive souvenir stalls.
The British pavilion commissioner is a former ambassador called Sir John Ure
and he incarnates the flag-waving motivation.
Convinced that 'the world and his wife' will be visiting Expo, Sir John is
determined that 'we should put our best foot forward'.
The British pavilion is the size of St Paul's Cathedral and it is entered by
way of a very impressive waterfall. 'We are still a major world and European
player and I would deeply resent doing things on the cheap,' says Sir John.
Anything other than an arresting presence would 'give the wrong message'.
Ireland's pavilion faces the British one and is a seventh of the size. Its
commissioner, an engaging professional actor called Denis Rafter, says it is
'a gentle and honest pavilion.' Mr Rafter shows off what the Irish have
achieved - their milestones, apart from the Atlantic voyages of St. Brendan
and their modern literature, included the invention of the Dunlop tyre and
of the hypodermic needle. Mr Rafter, an enthusiastic hispanophile, has
recruited a troupe of fluent Spanish-speaking Irish graduates to run his
pavilion. 'They are all at least trilingual,' he says. Their role is to
'project our young and skilled labour force'. The exit from the Irish
pavilion is through a series of panels that detail the country's principal
foreign investors.
If there was not an Expo in the wake of the Cold War and on the eve of a
Single Market, nations such as Hungary and Ireland would no doubt have felt
the need to invent one.
The talk of Expo as it limbers up to its inauguration is the Italian
pavilion which is almost as big as the Spanish one and constitutes a
determined attempt at Latin one-upmanship.
Expo officials are tolerant: 'Spain is stealing the Southern European show
and Italy had to respond, Columbus being Cristofolo Colombo and all that,'
says one.
The US pavilion, in contrast, is an embarrassment. Its twin geodesic domes
are second hand structures that have already served their time on the trade
fair circuit. It is dwarfed by the neighbouring New Zealand pavilion which
has a facade that reproduces the rocky coastline that Captain Cook first
saw.
Commissioner-General Cassinello, who was once Spanish ambassador in Mexico,
tries to be understanding about the US. 'They never properly understood that
this was going to be a great exhibition.'
US corporations have nevertheless made up for Washington's lack of vision.
Coca Cola is an official sponsor and also a chief cheer leader of a daily
parade that will snake its way through the pavilions every evening to
announce that daytime exhibits are about to close and that Expo's night
entertainment is due to start.
Rank Xerox, which is providing Expo with its information and document
management systems, is, together with Siemens and Fujitsu, one of three
multinationals that has set up a corporate pavilion. Enthusiastic Rank Xerox
officials say that Expo is 'the best living showroom' for the corporation's
products and an 'outstanding opportunity' to exhibit them.
Spain, naturally, stands to gain most of all. The host country's pavilion
has the choicest location; it looks out, on one side, to the Avenue of
Europe comprising the EC member nations and, on the other, it surveys an
artificial lake bordered by the pavilions of the 17 regions or autonomous
communities that make up the modern Spanish nation.
Expo, centred on the magnificently restored gothic Charterhouse in which
Columbus rested between his voyages, is an eyecatching reminder that Spain
enlarged the globe in 1492. And it reflects Spain's ambitions 500 years
later.
Money for the exposition zone, for the main pavilion, for the regional ones
and for the big thematic showstoppers has been no object. The overall budget
for the exposition, after four upward revisions in as many years, now stands
at Pta202bn.
As Spain digs ever deeper into its pocket, the government keeps smiling.
Every overshoot is justifiable, the organisers say, because it goes towards
'building a bigger and better Expo'. Expo knockers have claimed for months
that the show could not be ready on time. They are going to have to eat
their words. They also say it is all a Quixotic venture. But then pundits in
Lisbon and London scoffed at Columbus until he came to Spain.

THE WORLD'S most sophisticated railway lines run up to it. Europe's newest
airport was built for it. Spain's best roads have just reached it. What if
no one comes to it?
Of course they will] Welcome to the 1992 Universal Exposition, or Expo '92,
in Seville, the biggest, certainly the most expensive, and easily the most
rapidly assembled celebration of any single event, probably, in human
history.
The cost? About Dollars 9bn, but who's counting? It is too easy to knock
Expo - it is a big, brash, fabulous waste of money  - and much harder to
appreciate what its success means to Spain.
This is a country gripped by one dominating and rampaging anxiety - what do
other people think of it? Hardly a week goes by in Spain without a symposium
somewhere devoted to this very serious matter. Its newspapers write articles
about what foreign newspapers write about Spain.
Now, in these few days before Expo opens and the country's 1992 celebrations
(including the Olympics in Barcelona in July) really get underway, Spain is
fluffing its skirts and patting its hair like a young lady preparing for her
first date, hoping to get a glimpse of herself in a nice big mirror before
the night is over.
Expo and the foreigners that go to it are that mirror. By Expo's success and
by the smiles on the faces of its visitors, Spain, or a large part of it,
will judge itself. Spaniards know that many northern Europeans think they
are a lazy, good for nothing and untrustworthy lot.
It is nonsense, of course, but there have been some horrible moments along
the way to Expo: when a terrible fire, caused by careless working practices,
destroyed one of the Expo's most important pavilions in February, the press
was vicious.
'Chapuza Nacional' screamed one - national cock-up  - as if to say it before
some foreigner did. Earlier a replica of the first ship to sail round the
world toppled over moments after being launched and some crew in replicas of
Columbus's three ships tried to run away when they reached the US.
About 18m people, the organisers say, will go to Seville to meander about
the town and the Expo site between its opening on April 20 and its closure
176 days later on October 12, 500 years to the day that Christopher Columbus
first set foot in the new World.
The site is Cartuja Island, once home to a monastery where Columbus often
rested after his great voyages. The 450 hectare island sits in the middle of
the Guadalquivir River that skirts Seville and up which eventually sailed
gold-laden galleons for the century or so in which Spain was able to reap
maximum benefit from the colonisation of Latin America that Columbus had
begun.
The monastery still stands, but dwarfed by the incredible Expo city that has
been built around it. It is impossible to stand in the middle of it - even
while frantic last-minute preparations continued  - and not be thrilled by
the sheer scale of what has been put down on Cartuja and the speed with
which it has been done.
Just 18 months ago Cartuja was little more than a swampy bulldozed mess. In
four days time the Expo will open its 95 pavilions, 70 bars, 150 shops,
40,000-place car park, 16 banks to the public. Somehow, the organisers have
managed to squeeze in 55,000 different pieces of entertainment at 21 stages
dotted around the site. The New York Metropolitan Opera will be coming, and
so will opera from Vienna, Dresden and Milan. Trinidad and Tobago are
sending a steel band.
The whole point is that everyone is coming and Expo '92 is probably going to
be the last truly great cultural statement of this century. It is not, or it
should not be, a trade fair. It is a celebration of knowledge and,
specifically, discovery. The country, theme and corporate pavilions may not
push the barriers of architectural knowledge beyond what we already know,
but nowhere on earth are the eccentric and conventional forms and structures
of the late 20th century so brilliantly scrambled together. At the risk of
sounding like a publicist, Expo promises to be terrific fun.
This is, after all, Andalucia. The incredible noise on the streets and in
the bars of Seville could just as easily be the sound of Spain's beating
heart. These people taught the rest of Spain the meaning of fiesta.
Visitors might find Seville a little cramped - not any more so than during
its Easter fiesta - but it is the smallest city ever to host a Universal
Exposition and it has managed to attract the greatest number of countries to
take part. One result will be a great shortage of accommodation and what is
available will be very expensive.
For most of the time the fair is opened, it will also be unspeakably hot.
That partly explains why the Expo site will be open until four in the
morning every day and also why the organisers felt it necessary to plant
350,000 trees and shrubs around the site. Shade will be Expo's most valuable
commodity.
Just how valuable the Expo is to Seville is already easy to measure. It was
King Juan Carlos who first suggested (naturally, when one is the King, one's
ideas are always one's very own ideas) holding an Expo at Seville in 1992.
That was in the late 1970s. But it was the election of the socialist
government, led by Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez, in 1982 that really set
things moving.
Mr Gonzalez and his most senior advisers were all Andalucians in the early
years and they have bent over backwards to make sure that, along with the
Expo, Andalucia in 1992 would be used to mark the return of Spain to
prominence as a major economic and democratic power. Their Andalucia was
(and still is) a largely poor, dry and illiterate place. It has bred some
wonderful people but given them precious little to live off.
So Andalucia has been showered with gifts for this year. Easily the most
exotic is the world's newest high-speed train line, between Madrid and
Seville, with a branch to the Expo entrance.
Just outside Seville, where the airport was once little more than a
blockhouse, stands a spanking new terminal capable of taking 8m passengers a
year.
After the Expo, it could take Seville 20 years to use that airport to
capacity. Around the city are nearly 70km of new roads and eight new bridges
cross the Guadalquivir, while five new highways connect Seville with
Andalucia's other great centres and with Madrid.
This is Andalucia's big chance. It has become fashionable to speak of
Andalucia as Europe's next, or first, Silicon Valley. But it may just find
the imagination needed to turn the infrastructure it has been showered with
in the past few years to its advantage once all the visitors have gone.
The Expo organisers have already established a project - Cartuja 93  - which
is designed to preserve the Expo site more or less intact for use as a base
for research and study. Andalucia has never shown much interest in the
future, but Cartuja may change that.
Just as it may change the way Spaniards think about their past. What is
being celebrated here is Columbus's discovery of America, or what he thought
was the East, and the firm establishment, for arguably the first time, of
true democracy in Spain. Both are important, for the Expo has neatly
coincided with an intense effort by Spain to reconnect itself with its
former colonies in Latin America, which now account for just 3 per cent of
Spain's trade.
Latin America holds up a rather different mirror to Spain than do its
admiring European partners. It is an older mirror, perhaps darker too. The
devastation wrought by the Conquistadores on the native populations of the
countries they invaded still provokes quick and fiery argument in Spain.
Should Spain feel shame at that memory? Surely not now, just as it has been
able to welcome back and legalise the Jews 500 years after their expulsion
by Ferdinand and Isabella.
This is not a very contemplative society, but Spaniards who think about
themselves might want to extract as much as they can from the Latin
Americans who come to Seville. That continent's chaos, its struggle for
democracy, has a frighteningly clear reflection in Spain as well. Some
people think they know why - that by the time the Conquistadores sallied
forth democracy in Spain had already been lost as a trade off for land and
title.
That notion is suspect simply for being so neat and tidy and the lessons to
be drawn from what Columbus began 500 years ago in Latin America are not
easily defined. The Spanish started planning for 1992 calling it the year of
Discovery until South Americans reminded Spaniards that people were living
in the new world long before 1492. Spain changed the theme of 1992, then, to
the Re-encounter. That seems more apt and, even if it says nothing much, it
is at least a mark of a new humility.

FT  15 APR 92 / Survey of Monaco (8): A pivotal role - Tourism
</HEADLINE>

GONE are the days when the Grand Dukes of Russia would while away the summer
months in Monte Carlo, commandeering whole floors of the Hotel de Paris
where they spent their days scoffing salmon pojardy and blinis doused down
with magnums of the finest champagne.
The Monte Carlo of today still plays host to Europe's old and new wealth
when they descend on Monaco for the Bal du Rose in March, the Tennis Open in
April or the Grand Prix every May. It is for these visitors that most of
Monte Carlo's hotels are still in the luxury category and that the Place du
Casino is littered with the glossy shopfronts of Chanel and Cartier.
But the bulk of the principality's 3.5m annual visitors have more mundane
tastes. More than 3m of them are day trippers. These tourists have their own
attractions. The Societe des Bains de Mers (SBM), which owns the opulent
Hotel de Paris and the Monte Carlo casino, has renovated the Cafe de Paris
with its al fresco tables and ranks of gaming machines for them. Meanwhile
the Societe Monegasque de Tourisme Sous-Marine has sunk an aged tug-boat and
a replica Roman galley to entertain the passengers on its new Seabus
submarine during their 45-minute sub-aquatic tour of the harbour among the
seaweed, sponges and sea anemones.
Tourism is still a pivotal part of Monaco's economy, representing roughly 25
per cent of GDP. Monaco, like other tourist centres, was affected last year
by the impact of the Gulf war on international travel from the US and Japan
in the early months of 1991. The number of visitors staying for at least one
night fell by 20 per cent in the first half of 1991 but rallied in the
second half to produce an overall reduction of just 2 per cent to 239,043
for the full year.
The market has since recovered. 'Tourism started to pick up last August and
since then demand has been very healthy,' said Mr Gilles Noghes, managing
director of the Monaco Tourism Board. 'So far everything suggests that 1992
should be a very satisfactory year.'
Although day trippers, mainly from nearby France and Italy, now represent
the majority of Monaco's visitors, the 240,000 or so people who stay
overnight in the principality each year are much more important in terms of
revenue.
Until relatively recently, Monaco's tourism market was dominated by leisure
travellers rather than those on business. The principality's social calendar
 -from the charity balls to a new Jazz Festival, the first of which will be
held this June - aims at this market.
But in recent years business travel has become increasingly important,
providing 30 per cent of the principality's overnight visitors last year
compared with 10 per cent in the early 1970s. Business travel is seen as a
big growth market for the future. Monaco is already established as a centre
for management conferences - such as the TV Festival earlier this year - but
the government is now investing heavily in the construction of new
exhibition facilities, the Centre Culturel des Expositions, scheduled to
open on the Avenue Princess Grace in three years' time.
This project will be accompanied by an extension of Monaco's hotel
facilities. Two new hotels have already opened. The luxury Metropole, with
its marble floors and tapestry-draped walls, opened two years ago on the
Avenue de la Madonne near Place du Casino as a joint venture between Mr
Nabil Boustany, a Lebanese businessman, and the Conrad International arm of
the Hilton group. At about the same time the Abela Hotel also opened as a
200-room complex near the Fontvieille industrial development. In three
years' time, yet another new hotel will come on stream when the SBM
completes its new 400-room luxury hotel and casino complex near the Sporting
Club.
Mr Noghes is convinced that the market can withstand this increase in
capacity. 'This is an expanding market,' he said. 'The Metropole and the
Abela are both doing well as are the older hotels. The fact of the matter is
that at certain times of the year Monaco still does not have enough hotel
rooms and it will need even more in the future when the new exhibition
centre opens.'
The projected growth in business travel also ought to help alleviate the
problem of the seasonality of Monaco's appeal. Conferences and exhibitions
can, after all, be held at the times when the social calendar is quietest
and leisure tourism is quietest. The principality's sunny climate means that
Monaco is still attractive to visitors even at those quieter times of the
year. The SBM plans to invest in new services for business visitors in its
luxury hotels, such as faxes in rooms, to meet the needs of this market.
However, as the local tourist industry is well aware, it would be
counter-productive to boost business travel to such an extent that Monaco
was relegated to the ranks of the year-round conference centres. Much of its
appeal, even to people visiting the principality for exhibitions,
conferences or business meetings is its leisurely ambience.
The tourist board is also investing in the leisure travel sector. It
recently introduced a 'Passport to Monte Carlo' package of weekend breaks
intended to fill the big hotels during off-season weekends after the weekday
conference visitors have gone home.
It is also seeking to develop new national markets. Most of Monaco's
visitors come from Italy (30 per cent) and France (19 per cent) followed by
the US (12 per cent) where Monaco still has a special cachet thanks largely
to the legacy of Princess Grace. The tourist board now has marketing and
information offices in Japan and the US, as well as in Europe. Last year it
opened its first office in Madrid to try to develop the Spanish market.
Mr Raoul Biancheri, executive chairman of the SBM, is convinced that the
southern Mediterranean will be increasingly important as a source of custom
in the future. 'This region must be a key growth market for us,' he said.
But there is one group of tourists that Monaco will probably never attract.
The tone of the principality may be a touch lower than in the days when the
Russian Grand Dukes drank the cellars dry at the Hotel de Paris, but Monte
Carlo is still well beyond the means of the budget traveller. So much so
that the 'Let's Go Budget Guide to France' advises its impecunious readers
to eschew the hotels and hostelries of Monaco in favour of 'exile in Beau
Soleil' just across the French border 'where hotels are slightly cheaper'.

FT  15 APR 92 / Survey of Monaco (7): Furs, follies and glitterati - Out on
the town
</HEADLINE>

KATHERINE MANSFIELD, the 1920s writer, was known for her tart tongue and
waspish ways, but when it came to Monte Carlo, she was especially acerbic.
'It's real hell,' she said, 'the cleanest, most polished place I've ever
seen.'
The cleanliness and polish that so infuriated Ms Mansfield are probably the
very attributes that attract Monaco's residents and visitors today. Monaco,
with its hefty proportion of policemen per capita and plethora of litter
bins, is one of the few places where people can - and do  - walk around
wearing the furs and jewels they would be too frightened to flaunt in
Manhattan or Milan.
Over the years, Monaco has opened a stream of new attractions to entertain
its visitors. There is the Musee de l'Oceanographie, a highly-regarded
academic centre for marine research; or the 'Monte Carlo Story', an
English-language film on the principality's history which doubles as a
sanitised soap opera of the lives the royal family. And there is also the
rusty tug-boat sunk in the harbour last autumn to entertain the voyagers on
the new Seabus submarine.
Nearly everywhere you go in Monaco there are views of the luxury yachts and
cruisers moored in the harbour and of the sun glistening on the sea. But for
most visitors, Monaco polarises between the hills on either side of the
harbour - Monaco-Ville to the west, and Monte Carlo to the east.
Monaco-Ville is the home of the old town, the vieille ville, with its narrow
alleyways and the Prince's Palace. The streets are littered with souvenir
shops and pizza parlours. But even the clutter of Princess Grace plates and
the posters for her daughter, Stephanie's latest perfume, cannot completely
disguise the charm of the candy-coloured houses with their curves, cupolas
and the wrought-iron twists on their belle epoque balconies.
The Place de Palais is packed with Italian day-trippers, prancing
precariously on the ornamental cannon-balls or snapping up Monaco matelot
T-shirts from the souvenir stalls. Other visitors, presumably less
enthusiastic about devoting an entire day to the vain hope of spotting the
wayward Princess Stephanie, or one of her siblings, speeding away from the
palace, repair to the Jardins St Antoine that straggle along the cliffs
where Guillaume Apollinaire, the poet, once walked each day to seek
inspiration.
On the opposite side of the harbour, Monte Carlo, named in deference to
Prince Charles III, the 19th century monarch who transformed the
principality's finances by opening the casino, is the stamping ground for
the glitterati.
Here the visitor can join the gaggle of grandes dames who turn up day after
day - swathed in fur, whatever the weather  - to take tea, or something
stronger, and hound the waiters in the American Bar of the Hotel de Paris.
Or they can saunter around the shops. Cartier, Christian Dior, Chanel, Louis
Vuitton, Hermes and Valentino are all a stone's throw away from the Place du
Casino. The merchandise is the same as in Milan or Paris, but the shops are
quieter and the Monegasque assistants far friendlier than their famously
frosty Parisian counterparts.
Then there is the casino, the folly built by Charles Garnier, architect of
the Paris Opera, with its heart-shaped stucco mouldings and sensational
views out to sea.
This is the place where Mata Hari shot a German spy, where an Englishman,
Charles Deville Wells, won FFr10,000 one night to become 'the man who broke
the bank at Monte Carlo', and where Richard Burton gave Elizabeth Taylor
(yet another) knuckle duster of a diamond ring.
Nowadays there are slot machines in the casino's foyer and the Salle
Americaine opens every afternoon for games of craps or roulette at minimum
FFr25 bets. The serious players, the grands joueurs who will risk winning or
losing tens of thousands of francs at a sitting, arrive later in the evening
 -long after the casual visitors to the 'clean and polished' principality
have disappeared.

FT  15 APR 92 / Survey of Monaco (5): Image of refined riches - The Art
Market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONE by one the dealers trooped through the art deco portals of the Sporting
D'Hiver in Monte Carlo to collect their green cards and take their seats for
the start of Sotheby's sale of the Schlumberger collection.
'This is a very important sale,' said Princess Laure de Beauveau Craon, head
of Sotheby's in France. 'It is our first real opportunity to test the market
in 1992. There are pieces here at every level - from FFr22,000 all the way
to a pair of Dubois console tables at FFr8m.'
Princess Laure had no real cause for concern. However depressed the art
market may have been in recent years, the success of the Schlumberger sale
was sealed from the start when the first lot, a Louis XVI canape, sold for
FFr85,000, more than double the price in the catalogue. Even the exquisite -
and very expensive  - Dubois console tables met their target of FFr8m.
Sotheby's, the London-based auction house, has dominated Monaco's art market
ever since its first sale in the principality, the Dede Rothschild, in 1975.
It now holds about 20 sales a year in Monte Carlo and has been joined there
by most of its international competitors, including Christie's, its
arch-rival.
Monaco owes its role as an auction centre to Mr Peter Wilson, chairman of
Sotheby's in the 1960s and 1970s. France houses some of the world's most
important art and furniture collections. It is also a leading centre for
dealers and collectors. But the French government then, as now, imposed
rigorous restrictions on the sale of works of art and on their export out of
France
Even today it is virtually impossible for a foreign auction house such as
Sotheby's or Christie's to hold a sale in France.
The French market is in the grip of the Commissaires Priseurs, an arcane
band of individuals who can only acquire their auctioneers' licences from
someone retiring from the industry, subject to the justice ministry's
approval.
Some of the commissaires have banded together into partnerships. But their
ability to finance large international sales is inhibited by additional
restrictions preventing outside investors from owning more than 25 per cent
of their equity.
At the same time, the limitations on art exports make it difficult for the
international houses, such as Sotheby's and Christie's, from taking pieces
out of France for sale in London, Geneva or New York.
The French government is not only able to exercise the usual right of
pre-emption by buying any work sold in France at the 'hammer' price (the
price agreed at the auction), but is entitled to buy anything bound for a
foreign auction at the usually much lower minimum reserve price.
This last restriction, as Sotheby's Mr Wilson shrewdly observed, does not
apply to pieces sold in Monaco, where the French government must buy at the
'hammer price'. This means that, although anything sold in the principality
may be whisked back to France, at least the auctioneer does not lose out
financially. Mr Wilson saw Monaco, or rather Monte Carlo, as a solution to
Sotheby's 'French problem', acting as a sales centre for French collections
and as a local market for buyers in Italy and France.
The Monegasque government was only too happy to oblige. Art auctions were
completely compatible with the image of refined riches that Prince Rainier
and Princess Grace were so eager to instil in the principality. They would
be fun for the residents. They would also provide a new source of custom for
the local hotels as the art dealers checked in and out for the Monte Carlo
sales.
Monaco is now established as an important international art centre,
particularly for sales of French furniture, old master paintings, art deco
and art nouveau. The big auctions attract professional buyers from all over
the world, as well as local residents. However, as Mr Humphrey Burton, head
of Christie's in France, noted: 'A great deal of business in Monaco is
conducted by telephone bids. You don't find as many buyers in Monte Carlo as
in larger centres like London or New York.'
Over the years Monaco has hosted a number of significant sales. Christie's
started in 1985 with its FFr40m Clore sale, selling the furniture collected
by Sir Charles Clore, the British retailing magnate. Sotheby's staged its
Florence Gould and Claud Cartier sales there.
It has also chosen Monte Carlo for some of its more off-beat auctions such
as last autumn's FFr1.6m sale of the collection of Memphis furniture amassed
by Mr Karl Lagerfeld, the fashion designer, who lives in the principality.
In the 1980s, Monte Carlo also made a name as a centre for classic car
sales. Sotheby's set a world record for cars in the principality in 1990
when it sold a 1962 Ferrari 250 for FFr59m. But the car market has been in
the doldrums for the past year or so and neither Sotheby's nor Christie's
plans to hold motor auctions in Monaco this year.
By contrast, the core of the Monaco market - French furniture and 19th
century fine art - has remained relatively resilient, despite the depressed
state of the international art world.
'These are traditional areas of our business which did not attract
speculators in the 1980s, so have stayed stable since the market has become
more difficult,' said Princesse Laure of Sotheby's.
The big cloud hovering over the Monaco market is the prospect of France
being forced to reform - and relax  - its restrictions on art auctions in
line with those of other European Community countries after 1992. As soon as
that happens Sotheby's, Christie's and other houses will transfer some of
their Monegasque auctions to Paris.
However the auctioneers are convinced that there will still be a role for
Monaco. 'Clearly it will make sense for us to move some of our French sales
to Paris,' said Princess Laure. 'The dealers are there. Almost all our
French customers have one of their homes there. But we will still operate in
Monte Carlo. It is a very special place.'
Mr Burton of Christie's agreed. 'We would be crazy to sacrifice everything
we have built up in Monaco on the Parisian altar,' he said. 'Monte Carlo
will always play a part in the international art world. After all, it's fun
to do business here.'

FT  15 APR 92 / Survey of Monaco (6): Privacy eludes royal family - The
Grimaldis
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN Hello], the most gushing and garrulous of Britain's gossip magazines,
recently polled its readers on whom they considered to be their favourite
'celebrity' and 'Hello] cover star', the name of Princess Caroline of Monaco
came close to the top of every list.
In any other year it would have been entirely predictable that the
Chanel-clad Caroline with her glossy good looks and penchant for the Paris
fashion shows should have appeared in such a poll. But Hello] had polled its
readers little more than a year after the sudden death of her husband, Mr
Stefano Casiraghi, in a power boat race.
Princess Caroline had spent that year as a recluse. She had retreated with
her children to a tiny village in rural Provence. She had cropped her hair,
worn mourning black and, on the very rare occasions when she did appear in
public, she had done so bereft of make-up and hidden behind a pair of
sunglasses.
In short, she had done everything she could to signal to the world at large
 -and the paparazzi in particular  - that, devastated by the death of her
husband, she needed peace and privacy.
But privacy is elusive for Monaco's royal family. Princess Caroline and the
other Grimaldis have lived their lives in a blaze of publicity and the glare
of paparazzi flashes. So much so that Caroline has been as hounded by the
press in her Provencal retreat as she was when a feted figure at Paris
parties and Monte Carlo galas.
It was not always thus. The Grimaldis and their domain, a rocky stretch of
Riviera coastline, were dismissed as yet another anachronism of the European
aristocracy until April 1956 when Prince Rainier III, Monaco's 33rd
sovereign, married Miss Grace Patricia Kelly, the Hitchcock blonde who was
one of Hollywood's most stylish movie stars.
More than 1,600 journalists and photographers descended on Monaco for their
wedding. They, and their successors, have haunted the Grimaldis ever since.
At first, Prince Rainier and Princess Grace turned the press attention to
their - and Monaco's  - advantage.
In 1949, when the 26-year-old Rainier took the throne, Monaco was seen, as
the writer Somerset Maugham put it, as 'a sunny place for shady people', as
a glitzy, gambling centre for the sleazier end of the Cote D'Azur sybaritic
set.
If the new prince was to secure its future he needed to clean up Monaco's
image and to revitalise the economy to stem the flow of emigres to the US
and France.
Rainier did this by turning his principality into the sort of place where
the seriously wealthy would want to live and visit. In short, Monaco was
restyled in the image of his wife, Princess Grace, with her blend of
American affluence and Hollywood glamour.
Her old friends - Frank Sinatra, Cary Grant and Gregory Peck  - flocked to
see her as she inaugurated hospitals, theatres, flower festivals and charity
balls. The European and American press covered it all.
Monaco became a haven for sun-loving taxphobes and middle-aged millionaires.
It is, or so says Tatler magazine, 'a place where every August you wear your
wealth to the Red Cross Ball and for five hours there is more money in
diamonds and gold under the sliding roof of Le Sporting than anywhere else
on the continent'. Monaco's new residents and visitors have transformed the
economy, creating a thriving financial centre with Dollars 10bn of deposits
lodged in its bank vaults and a flourishing tourist industry with employment
and business opportunities for the indigenous Monegasques.
Rainier and Grace seemed prepared to accept the glare of press attention as
the price to be paid for stability and prosperity. But as their children -
Albert and Stephanie, as well as Caroline  - grew older, the price became
higher and higher.
The Grimaldis live in a world where photographers camp outside their Paris
apartments, where journalists hire para-gliders to fly over their country
home hoping to catch the princesses sunbathing topless, and where the
paparazzi throw tacks on to roads hoping to stop their cars.
Everything they do - from Prince Albert cocooning on a yacht with the latest
in his long line of blondes, to Stephanie hurling obscenities at journalists
as she speeds away in her sports car, and Caroline sobbing at her husband's
funeral - is splashed all over the gossip pages. There are even small
photographic agencies in France and Italy that survive simply by preying on
the Monaco royal family.
Over the years the Grimaldis have given the press everything. There have
been the tragedies - the dramatic deaths of Grace and Stefano haunted by the
curse of the beautiful Flemish girl betrayed by one of Rainier's womanising
predecessors who vowed 'Never will a Grimaldi find true happiness in
marriage'. There have been the scandals - the failure of Caroline's first
marriage, Albert's cast list of blondes and, of course, Princess Stephanie.
The youngest of the Grimaldis has been God's gift to the paparazzi. Caroline
may have had a wild time in her 20s, but she is now cast by the press as the
'good girl', the devoted wife and mother who knuckled under to take Grace's
place as the first lady of Monaco after her mother's death. Luckily for the
gossip columns, her sister, Stephanie, has been only too adept at filling
the empty role of 'bad girl'.
Stephanie has had even more boyfriends than Albert has had blondes. She
seldom seems to wear a bikini-top. And she can always be relied upon to reel
out of night clubs in the not so early hours of the morning. She has also
led a more public life than her siblings, having pursued brief careers as a
fashion designer, a model and then recording a pop single.
When her latest perfume, L'Insaisissable (The Unpossessable), came out,
glossy magazines were peppered with quotes from her former boyfriends saying
'when it comes to being fickle she's a professional' and 'men are just toys
to her'.
There is a serious sub-text to all this. The Grimaldis are absolute
monarchs. Prince Rainier not only rules the principality, advised by his
counsellors, but his family sets the tone.
Rainier is now in his 70s and, still haunted by the memory of his wife's
sudden death, he is said to want to abdicate to clear the way for Albert and
spend more time with his grandchildren.
Only he knows whether he will feel able to do so while his son and daughters
are still being splashed all over the gossip columns and preyed upon by
photographers armed with telephoto lenses.

IF you ask the chairman of one of Europe's larger leisure groups about his
company's prospects for the coming year, you don't really expect him to say
that it depends on how many high stakes gamblers, or grands joueurs, come to
his casinos and whether they win or lose.
But that is exactly how Mr Raoul Biancheri, executive chairman of Societe
des Bains de Mers (SBM), by far the biggest single business in Monaco,
responds to such a question. 'In a business like our's, the grands (itals)
joueurs (itals) can make an enormous difference,' he says. 'Everything
depends on whether they come to Monte Carlo and on how well they play.'
The fluctuating fortunes of the grands joueurs have dominated SBM's
development ever since its formation in 1863.
SBM, then known as the Societe Anonyme des Bains de Mer et du Cercle des
Etrangers, was founded by princely decree when Prince Charles III of Monaco
gave Mr Francois Blanc, the man who had turned the obscure town of Bad
Homburg in Bavaria into the glitzy gambling centre of Europe, a 50-year
licence to run a casino in Monte Carlo.
Before the casino, Monaco had been a small, poverty-stricken village
clinging to its cliff on the coastline along from the flourishing Riviera
towns of Nice and Cannes. Prince Charles III had seen how gambling had
transformed the Bavarian economy. Gambling was then illegal in France, but
that law did not apply to the independent state of Monaco.
The prince dispatched his private secretary to Bad Homburg to investigate
and founded the SBM - euphemistically called a 'Sea Bathing Company' so as
not to arouse the suspicions of the French authorities - to own and operate
a casino in Monte Carlo, together with hotels to house its wealthy patrons.
Monaco's first attempts at casino management were not a success.
For starters, even the most enthusiastic of would-be gamblers must have
baulked at the journey to Monaco which involved risking life and limb on a
four-hour ride from Nice in a rickety vehicle or an equally unpleasant
journey in the Palmaria, a sea tub stuffed with flour and olive oil.
In its first week, the casino attracted just one player and he walked out
having won FFr2.
Mr Francois Blanc had more ambitious plans. His first project, the Hotel de
Paris, opened its doors in 1864 on a scrap of wasteland on the rock opposite
the royal palace which was rechristened, in deference to its princely
patron, Mount Charles, or Monte Carlo.
By the time Mr Blanc died in 1877, there were 35 hotels in Monte Carlo and
his casino was taking FFr10m a year.
Four years later, his widow, Marie, commissioned Charles Garnier, architect
of the opulent Opera in Paris, to build a brand new casino.
Hotels and gambling have been the base of SBM's business ever since. The SBM
of today owns four hotels - the Hermitage, Mirabeau and Monte Carlo Beach,
as well as the Hotel de Paris - with interests in gambling, sports
facilities and discotheques.
It is an institution in Monaco, being 67 per cent owned by the state, the
biggest single employer with a workforce of more than 2,000, and owning one
twelfth of the principality's land.
The SBM's financial fortunes have waxed and waned over the years. Its
profits declined in the mid-1980s because of losses at the main casino and
low occupancy rates in its big hotels, which have historically been seen as
loss-leaders to attract clients to its casinos.
Its performance improved in the late 1980s when the casino returned to
profit. By the 1988-89 financial year, the SBM was able to swallow an
accelerated write-off on sports facilities, increased provisions for
gambling risks and even an ill-fated investment in Badouin, the failed Paris
stockbroker - to make net profits of FFr198m on sales of FFr1.5bn.
By the following year its profits had risen to FFr290m and sales to FFr1.7bn
despite a decline in its hotel interests where operating profits slipped
from FFr30m to FFr22m because of the disruption to tourism caused by the
Gulf war.
By contrast its gambling receipts rose from FFr215 to FFr284m during the
year.
Mr Biancheri said that, so far, 1991-92 had shown a marked recovery. One
indication of the improved climate is the occupancy rates at the hotels, all
of which are back to above 60 per cent for 1991-92.
Meanwhile, the SBM is locked into a long-term investment programme to
protect its position in an increasingly competitive market.
The SBM is building a 400-room luxury hotel and casino next to the Sporting
Club, scheduled to open in three years' time.
But the Hotel de Paris and the Hermitage recently acquired a new rival in
the Metropole, complete with four stars, Christofle cutlery, Limoges china
and a baby jacuzzi in every bathtub.
The SBM is responding by renovating the rooms at the Hermitage and a series
of improvements at the Hotel de Paris. Its FFr2m investment in the Louis XV
restaurant at the Hotel de Paris has already paid off in terms of three
Michelin stars and higher receipts for the Louis XV and its superstar chef,
Mr Alain Ducasse.
As for gambling, the new hotel development will include a casino for
American games, following the success of the Cafe de Paris scheme.
Earlier this year, the SBM introduced two new American games - Punto Banco,
a derivative of baccarat, and Pago Poker, a form of stud poker - to the main
casino.
The SBM's critics claim it should be more adventurous and plough its hefty
cash pile into new areas of activity inside and outside Monaco. But Mr
Biancheri, possibly still bruised by the memory of the Badouin debacle,
brushes aside such comments.
'Our business is in hotels and casinos,' he says. 'Those are the areas that
we know and that we are good at. So we will stick to them.'
