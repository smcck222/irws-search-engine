AUSTRALIA's mainstream political parties suffered a sharp defeat in a
by-election on Saturday to fill the seat vacated by Mr Bob Hawke, the former
prime minister.
More than 30 per cent of the electorate in Wills, a working-class district
of Melbourne, registered their anger over unemployment by voting for Mr Phil
Cleary, an independent candidate and local football hero.
The result was a disaster for the ruling Labor party. Wills has
traditionally been a safe Labor seat but in Saturday's election the party's
share of support fell by 20 per cent compared with the last election two
years ago.
This was despite heavy campaigning by Mr Paul Keating, the prime minister.
Labor officials have conceded the prolonged recession and high unemployment
in the area led to the party's defeat.
Wills has the highest unemployment rate in Victoria, the state which itself
has the highest jobless level in the country.
Almost 20,000 are unemployed out of a total population of about 140,000.
The result also delivered a big blow to the Liberal party's hopes of
becoming an acceptable alternative to Labour. While the party suffered only
a 7 per cent fall in its primary vote, it failed to pick up the protest vote
against Labor.

FT  13 APR 92 / Rafsanjani poised for victory over hardliners

<TEXT>
IRAN'S President Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani appeared last night to have
won a significant victory over hardliners in parliamentary elections,
allowing him to push ahead with economic reform and stronger ties with the
west.
According to early results, with counting completed in most provinces, the
president's moderate supporters appear to have won a two-thirds majority
over hardliners after last Friday's election to the 270-seat Majlis, or
parliament.
While a full tally will not be available until tonight, Mr Rafsanjani's
rivals have so far won few seats. Hojatoleslam Ali Akbar Mohtashemi, former
minister of the interior and chief among the president's opponents, won only
13,000 votes, putting him well down the list of candidates in Tehran, the
capital.
Hardliners held the majority in the outgoing Majlis, which was elected a
year before Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's death in 1989.
Voter turnout was low throughout the country, especially in Tehran, in
protest at the government's handling of the economy. Recent privatisation
and deregulation of the heavily centralised economy have led to soaring
prices and an unstable currency. The rial is worth only one-twentieth of its
pre-revolutionary value against the dollar.

FT  13 APR 92 / Mitterrand launches drive for Maastricht ratification
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Francois Mitterrand last night launched his campaign for the
ratification of the Maastricht Treaty of European Union, which he described
as 'a great undertaking for the prosperity of France'.
In an hour-long television interview, the president passionately defended
his commitment to the European Community, which he claimed was essential for
France's future.
'France is our motherland and Europe is our future,' he said. He vigorously
rejected the idea that the project for European Monetary Union would deprive
France of its monetary independence: 'Do you think we have it now?' he
asked.
The president made clear that the Maastricht Treaty would have to be
ratified as it stood, and could be neither modified nor postponed.
Ratification would have to be completed in time for the treaty to come into
force on January 1 1993, and he hoped that it would be complete by the
summer.
He indicated his clear preference for ratification of the Maastricht Treaty
by a purely parliamentary procedure in a joint session of the National
Assembly and the Senate. However, he held out the possibility of a popular
referendum if the joint session looked likely to fall short of the necessary
three-fifths majority.
Mr Mitterrand's television appearance follows hard on last Thursday's report
by the Constitutional Council, which identified three features of the
Maastricht Treaty which would require changes in the French constitution
before the treaty could be ratified. These three issues all related to
different forms of the loss of national sovereignty.
First, the extension of voting rights in local elections to residents from
other EC member states: the problem is that municipal authorities contribute
to the electoral colleges of local notables which elect the Senate members,
and thus play an indirect role in the exercise of national sovereignty.
Second, the Community's declared objective of monetary union.
Third, the Community's policy on the visas required by foreign travellers,
which would be decided by majority voting as from 1996.
In theory, President Mitterrand ought to be able to push through these
constitutional reforms without great difficulty, despite the opposition of
the Communist party and the National Front.
On the other hand, all political calculations in France have become more
delicate as a result of his administration's humiliating defeat in last
month's regional elections.
The president can certainly count on the support of virtually all the
Socialist party, apart from a small nationalist faction led by Mr
Jean-Pierre Chevenement, the former defence minister. In addition, he can
expect the support of the centre-right UDF grouping.
However, the right-wing Gaullist RPR party has already indicated opposition
to local voting rights for foreigners, and a single European currency. It
seems unlikely that the Gaullists will oppose the Maastricht Treaty as a
whole.
A majority of the French public would like a referendum on the Maastrict
Treaty on European union, according to an IPSOS opinion poll published in
yesterday's Journal de Dimanche, reports Alice Rawsthorn in Paris.
In the poll, 66 per cent favoured a referendum, with 24 per cent voting
against. Almost half, 48 per cent, said they would endorse the Maastricht
summit.

FURTHER progress is not possible in negotiations on tariff cuts and services
liberalisation in the Uruguay Round of global trade talks without a
breakthrough on farm subsidies, Mr Arthur Dunkel, director-general of the
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt), will tell negotiators today.
US and EC negotiators will meet again this week when Brussels is expected to
put forward new proposals for a farm subsidy accord.
This has raised hopes that agreement could be finalised at an April 22
meeting in Washington between President George Bush, Mr Jacques Delors,
president of the EC Commission, and Mr Anibal Cavaco Silva, the prime
minister of Portugal, which holds the EC presidency.
Mr Bush said last week that he was more optimistic about a deal, having
learnt that Mr Delors considered the two sides 'very, very close'.
Though the Easter deadline for completion of the 108-nation Round will be
missed, trade officials hope that, if the US and EC can settle their
differences over farm trade reform by the end of April, other outstanding
differences and technical details of the Uruguay Round agreement could be
settled in two months.
This would allow completion of the Round before the end of June.

<TEXT>
ON the eve of his first official visit to Turkey, France's President
Francois Mitterrand has moved to stem an embarrassing controversy over his
wife's support for the Kurds, signalling his government's backing for
Ankara's Kurdish reform programme.
A week ago France, together with other EC members, criticised Turkey's
handling of recent Kurdish unrest, in which 100 demonstrators were killed in
clashes with security forces. Mrs Danielle Mitterrand, whose human rights
group, France Libertes, campaigns for Kurdish rights, is not accompanying
her husband.
But French officials are keen the Kurdish controversy should not cloud the
Mitterrand visit, the first by a French head of state in 24 years.
He is taking five ministers, including Mr Roland Dumas, the foreign
minister, who is expected to initial a new diplomatic protocol. Top of the
agenda will be security, in particular Turkey's role in the Caucasus and in
north Iraq, where French aircraft are using Turkish bases to provide
security for Iraqi Kurds.
In the past four years France has emerged as Turkey's leading investment
partner, with French groups taking strategic positions in the Turkish
cement, gas and insurance sectors.

FT  13 APR 92 / City struggles to beat bomb: Two buildings face demolition
as total damage is costed at Pounds 1.5bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHY MILTON, JIMMY BURNS and RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CITY of London will today struggle to work in the wake of the IRA bomb
which killed three people and injured dozens of City workers on Friday
night.
Up to 14 buildings suffered severe structural damage in the attack. At least
two - the Baltic Exchange and the Chamber of Shipping, both in St Mary Axe -
face demolition, according to City surveyor Mr Ted Hartill.
Fears that the attack will damage the City's position as a financial centre
were dismissed yesterday by the lord mayor of London, Sir Brian Jenkins. 'It
is appalling and horrific but I don't believe it will have any effect on
this great financial centre,' he said.
Sir Brian said efforts were being made to find accommodation for companies
whose offices were destroyed. He said the surplus of office space in central
London was making the task easier. The City corporation has already
re-located 85 per cent of affected businesses
The Baltic Exchange, which arranges most of the world's freight chartering
and more than half of the world's ship sales, took the full force of the
explosion. Mr Peter Tudball, the exchange's chairman, said: 'It looked to me
like a film set for an earthquake. Somebody else said it looked like
Beirut.'
The bomb, contained in a van, was the biggest on mainland Britain since the
Second World War and injured 91 people.
The Chamber of Shipping, whose building stands next to the Baltic Exchange,
seems likely to be demolished. The 50 staff at the chamber, which is the
trade association for UK companies that own and manage ships, have been
offered accommodation in west Smithfield.
The future of the Commercial Union tower, also in St Mary Axe, also appears
to be in doubt. CU, one of Britain's biggest insurance groups, intends to
move its 650 staff who worked in the building to six sites, four of them in
Croydon, south London, and two elsewhere in the City.
Official estimates yesterday put the total number of affected businesses at
36, in some 40 buildings. Surveyors and engineers who spent the weekend
inspecting the damage caused to some 1m sq ft of office space estimated the
cost of repairs at Pounds 1.5bn.
The Bank of England has opened an emergency advice line (071-601 4444),
manned by banking experts and other City specialists, to advise foreign
exchange dealers facing problems as a result of damage. Staff are advised to
call their companies to find out where they should go. A public information
point will be set up at Guildhall, Gresham Street.
British Telecom, which said up to 12,000 lines served by its exchange in the
area were disrupted by the blast, will be re-routing calls to companies
forced to relocate.
The Association of British Insurers said companies would be paying out under
explosion insurance which covered acts of terrorism.
The only business in the severely damaged buildings that declared itself
unable to operate today was the European Bank for Reconstruction and
Development, whose 400 employees work in a building between the Commercial
Union Tower and Lloyd's.
Mr David Coleridge, chairman of Lloyd's, said he believed the bombers had
intended to target the insurance market. The Lloyd's building was virtually
unscathed and, pending police approval, intends to open this morning.
Mr Coleridge said he intended to offer space at Lloyd's to the Baltic
Exchange.
Police manned security cordons in the City over the weekend although by this
morning only an area immediately around the centre of the blast will remain
closed to allow police to continue forensic investigations.
Another IRA bomb early on Saturday which damaged a road at the south-west
corner of Staples Corner roundabout in north-west London is expected to
cause up to 12 months of delays.

FT  13 APR 92 / Major focuses on industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN MAJOR has put government support for British industry at the centre
of his post-election strategy with the appointment of Mr Michael Heseltine
to head an enlarged Department of Trade and Industry.
Mr Heseltine's move, part of a weekend cabinet reshuffle which saw Mr Norman
Lamont confirmed as chancellor, was described by senior Whitehall officials
as an attempt to make Mr Major's administration more 'industry-friendly'.
The reshuffle, the first real opportunity Mr Major has had to stamp his
authority on the cabinet since taking over from Mrs Margaret Thatcher 16
months ago, saw a large-scale redistribution of cabinet responsibilities.
Mr Kenneth Baker, the former home secretary, and Mr Tom King, the former
defence secretary, were among four ministers to lose their jobs. Among the
newcomers, Mr Michael Portillo, an unapologetic Thatcherite on economic
policy, takes charge of public spending as the new chief secretary.
The new cabinet line-up, with Mr Kenneth Clarke promoted to home secretary
and Mr John Patten given responsibility for education, signals Mr Major's
intention of giving the government a more responsive image while sticking to
the core of its economic strategy.
The prime minister has balanced promotions for those on the left and centre
of his party with comparable moves for the most prominent figures on the
right. Mr Michael Howard, a leading free-marketeer, takes over an expanded
environment department.
Some ministers had expected Mr Lamont to be moved from the Treasury, but Mr
Major was said to have been impressed by the chancellor's determination to
curb inflation in the approach to the election. Mr Lamont will also be a key
figure in piloting through the House of Commons legislation to give effect
to the treaty on economic and monetary union agreed at Maastricht.
Mr Major's decision to reward Mr Heseltine for his vigorous role in the
election campaign will give the DTI much greater influence in shaping policy
towards business. He will take the department of employment's previous
responsibilities for small businesses and the DTI will also take charge of
the oil and coal industries.

FT  13 APR 92 / Smith and Gould set to vie for Labour leadership
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY and RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN SMITH, the shadow chancellor, and Mr Bryan Gould, the shadow
environment secretary, emerged over the weekend as the main challengers in
any race for leadership of the Labour party.
Mr Neil Kinnock, the Labour leader, and Mr Roy Hattersley, his deputy, are
expected today to announce formally that they will not be seeking
renomination to their posts in the wake of last week's general election
defeat.
Several other possible contenders are understood to have opted not to run
after it became clear that Mr Smith, aged 53, the odds-on favourite, had
already received firm pledges of support from many leading Labour MPs and
trade unions.
The hard-left Campaign Group is expected to put forward Mr Ken Livingstone,
MP for Brent East, or Mr Dennis Skinner, MP for Bolsover, in a largely
symbolic gesture. The group has protested against a rule that candidates
need the backing of 20 per cent of the parliamentary party - 55 MPs in the
new parliament - which it believes it will be unable to attain.
Mr Kinnock, aged 50, is said to be anxious for a quick transition, so there
is a possibility that a special party conference - sitting as an electoral
college - could be convened as soon as June. A vote on the leadership
normally takes place at the party conference in October.
The option of a June conference, opposed by Mr Gould, 53, could be agreed at
a specially convened meeting of Labour's national executive committee this
week. Normally, the NEC meets at the end of the month.
The fiercest battle could be for the deputy leadership which Mr Gould may
also contend, alongside Mrs Margaret Beckett, the shadow chief secretary,
and, possibly, Mr John Prescott, the left-wing transport spokesman.
Speculation that Mr Gordon Brown and Mr Robin Cook, the Scottish trade and
health spokesmen, might put in a leadership challenge has been firmly
denied. Both men support Mr Smith and are determined not to split loyalties
within the Scottish Labour party at a time when divisions are emerging as to
how to react to the election defeat and the consequent collapse of Labour's
plan for a Scottish parliament.
Last night, Mr Donald Dewar, Labour's Scottish secretary, attempted to
pre-empt pressure for an alliance with the Scottish National party by
demanding a referendum on the country's constitutional future.
In a parallel development, Mr Paddy Ashdown, the Liberal Democrat leader,
made clear he would consult today with parliamentary colleagues about an
appeal to the Labour leadership for a cross-party commission on electoral
reform.
He plans to write to Labour calling for an inquiry along the lines of the
Scottish constitutional convention. It would be aimed at winning greater
public support for proportional representation.
Under Labour's rules, the leadership is decided by the party conference
sitting as an electoral college with the trade unions commanding 40 per cent
of the votes and MPs and the constituency parties holding 30 per cent each.
Mr Smith is widely expected to win outright in all three divisions.
Supporters of Mr Gould believe that his best hope is if there is a lengthy
interval before the election takes place. Mr David Blunkett, Labour's local
government spokesman, warned against an early rush to select a new party
leader.

FT  13 APR 92 / Farewell Asimov, prince of Sci-Fi: America
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   I may be wrong, but I suspect most British intellectuals
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
certainly those with literary pretensions - have nothing but disdain for
Isaac Asimov, the prolific American science fiction writer. Asimov is
associated with ray guns, lurid covers and worthless prose. It may come as a
surprise, therefore, that his death last week was marked by long,
appreciative obituaries in leading US newspapers. The Washington Post
honoured his passing with an editorial.
My own view of Asimov, I confess, is far from objective. In the late 1960s,
at the age of about 12, I became addicted to science fiction. I remember,
for example, being utterly absorbed by Asimov's famous Foundation trilogy,
which described the fall of a future Galactic Empire and efforts by social
scientists to head off a feared descent into 30,000 years of barbarism.
Asimov later admitted that the Foundation stories were inspired by Gibbon's
Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, which he had read twice as a young
man. But the name Gibbon would have meant nothing to me then.
Asimov, of course, was more than just a sci-fi writer. From his mid-30s he
was motivated mainly by a desire to make complex ideas accessible to lay
readers. Working at a frenetic pace, he produced nearly 500 books, mostly
nonfiction. He seemed able to master just about any subject, turning out
Asimov 'guides' on topics as diverse as atomic physics, neurology, the
Bible, Greek culture and Shakespeare. Marvelling at his energy, the Post
editorial hails him as a throwback to earlier centuries when scholars had
the confidence to embrace all branches of human knowledge.
I share the Post's admiration for his phenomenal range. But I cannot help
wondering whether an English Asimov would be feasible: the American writer
surely benefited from the greatest virtue of American education: the lack of
specialisation at high schools and colleges.
Asimov embodied several American virtues. He raised himself by hard graft as
much as by intellect, typically working a 15-hour day. (His parents, poor
Russian immigrants, provided a fine example, keeping their Brooklyn candy
store open from 6am to 1am, seven days a week.) He was intensely
individualistic, writing about space travel but refusing to fly, indifferent
to his considerable wealth, and conspicuous only for bushy white sideburns
that looked almost as odd as the pointed ears of Mr Spock of Star Trek fame.
He was a democrat with a small 'd", writing without condescension for often
poorly educated readers. Above all, he reflected modern America's
infatuation with science and technology: it always amazes me that routine
flights of the space-shuttle rate top billing on TV and radio.
What value, however, should we place on Asimov, the sci-fi writer? By normal
literary standards, his work is indeed thin gruel; characters are poorly
developed and his use of language lacks sophistication. Yet contempt for
sci-fi is often misplaced. In a sympathetic recent assessment in the
Atlantic magazine, Mr Thomas Disch, a US theatre critic and sci-fi writer,
argues that the genre should be understood - and hence judged - primarily as
a form of children's fiction. This seems too harsh: the huge sales of sci-fi
books and the dazzling success of movies such as Star Wars, ET, Blade Runner
and Back to the Future demonstrates its appeal to adults. A better way to
characterise sci-fi is to say that it is dedicated to the exploration of
ideas. It hardly matters if the human beings are wooden because they are
often of secondary importance.
Asimov produced his best fiction in the 1940s and 1950s, a period of
extraordinary creativity for sci-fi. Many of the ideas were far ahead of
their time. Asimov, for example, coined the term robotics and invented laws
for programming androids' brains when the electronic computer was in its
infancy and long before artificial intelligence existed as an academic
discipline. He conceived worlds where holograms were so perfect that human
beings ceased to interact physically. His compatriot James Blish imagined
engines and force-fields that would allow US cities such as New York to
break free from the Earth and fly anarchically through outer space. Arthur C
Clarke, later famous for the movie 2001: A Space Odyssey, anticipated
earth-orbiting satellites and wrote about colonising Mars.
Technology played a central role in most of the stories. But some writers
engaged in social satire. Frederick Pohl, for example, satirised American
consumerism in the 1950s, depicting an inverted social pyramid in which the
poorer you got, the more goods and services you were forced to consume; only
the ultra rich were thin and free to live in comparative austerity.
It is hard to know what spurred the creativity of Asimov and his fellow
sci-fi writers. The invention of atom bombs, rockets and gadgets of all
kinds must have impressed young minds. But their penchant for extravagant
scientific fantasy probably also reflected the stability and dominance of US
society in the post-war years - and its focus on technological rather than
economic or social values. When everyday life is dull and predictable, young
minds start free-wheeling. It was, after all, in the late summer of
Victorian stability that young H G Wells produced such classics as The Time
Machine and The War of the Worlds.

FT  13 APR 92 / The weaknesses of strength: Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN DAVIDSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
After last Thursday's general election, it looks as if Britain is once again
the odd man out in Europe. The governments of France, Germany and Italy have
all been hammered in recent elections by a wave of protest votes; the
British government alone has managed to get solidly re-elected.
This striking contrast cannot be explained in terms of merit. The setback
suffered by the Andreotti government in Italy may be a long-delayed and
well-deserved punishment for decades of incompetent and corrupt
administration. But by most ordinary yardsticks, France and Germany enjoy
standards of economic management and political government which are not
merely worthy, but manifestly superior to those of Britain. The return to
power of the Conservatives in Britain, and the ferocity of the popular
rejection of the Mitterrand administration in France, are equally difficult
to justify.
These differences are relatively uninteresting, however, compared with the
fact that there is now one issue common to a number of European countries,
and that is the issue of constitutional reform. At first glance, this may
seem a pure coincidence. In Britain, proportional representation was a hot
subject when the country was facing the prospect of a hung parliament. In
Italy, the question of electoral reform has forced its way on to the agenda
as a result of the election disaster. In France, constitutional reform has
been placed on the agenda by President Mitterrand as part of his political
end-game.
Yet this coincidence may not be quite as fortuitous as it looks. First,
there is a fairly obvious correlation in each of these countries between the
shortcomings of government performance and the defects of the constitutional
systems. In France, for example, there are some real advantages in the
quasi-regal presidency; the drawback is that the president is so powerful
that the government ceases to be responsible and the parliament ceases to be
significant.
Second, almost every western European country will have to re-examine and
perhaps reform its constitutional arrangements, in the context of the future
development of the European Community. France will have to revise its
constitution in order to give residents from other Community countries the
vote in local French elections; Italy will have to change its budgetary
machinery if it wants to keep up with monetary union in Europe.
Britain's Conservatives will naturally reject both halves of this
proposition. They will, of course, claim their clear election victory last
Thursday as the ultimate vindication of Britain's existing constitutional
arrangements, starting with its first-past-the-post voting system. This
system, unique in Europe, has once again ensured that a minority of votes
produces a majority in parliament. Therefore the government can once again
reject all talk of electoral reform, bills of rights, freedom of
information, devolution and the protection of the citizen.
Yet the government would be making a mistake if it were to conclude that
these constitutional issues, which were debated so intensely during the
election campaign in anticipation of a hung parliament, can now be stuffed
back in the broom closet.
During the election campaign, Mr John Major argued against proportional
representation on the grounds that it would prevent 'strong' government. The
trouble is that strong government is either unnecessary in present
circumstances, or it is disreputable. A country may need strong government
in wartime, because popular sacrifices may be required which are not readily
volunteered. But if there is no such national emergency, strong government
is merely government for the convenience of the governors: one which has the
power to impose partisan or ideological policies against the will of the
people.
There is no shortage of suitable words to describe good government. Perhaps
we need stable government; or reasonable government; or moderate government;
or considerate, government; or rational, responsible or even intelligent
government, for heaven's sake. What we do not need is strong government. In
the past 45 years, Britain has had many bouts of strong government; just
look at the results.
One reason why we do not need strong government, in Mr Major's sense, is
that it is by definition highly centralised government. As it is, British
government is already far too centralised, and this defect was made worse by
Mrs Thatcher. Centralised government may have been appropriate for Britain
and France in the era of expanding empires in the 19th century; it makes no
sense for countries inside the European Community.
The future development of the Community will unavoidably mean progressive
transfers of competence from national capitals to European institutions.
Those transfers will be increasingly difficult to handle politically, unless
national governments become more responsive to national electorates, and
also counter-balance lost sovereignty through the devolution of other
competences closer to the grass roots. Mr Major's victory will not protect
him from the need to make constitutional changes as a counter-point to the
developing Community.

FT  13 APR 92 / Foreign Exchanges and Money Markets: To cut or not to cut
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WITH STERLING still riding high from last week's shock Conservative victory,
debate this week in the markets will doubtless continue to focus on the
chances for a cut in UK base rates, Emma Tucker writes.
In the heat of the election's aftermath let it not, after all, be forgotten
that Britain is still struggling to come out of a deep recession and a cut
in the cost of borrowing would help beleaguered businesses invest for future
growth.
Key economic data out this week may well be disappointing. Although
manufacturing output and imports should show signs of recovery, M4 lending
and retail sales may not.
But with a five year mandate secured, the political pressure to cut base
rates has been lifted off the shoulders of the Conservative government, and
they may decide to wait for the pound to strengthen before they even
consider a further reduction.
According to Mr Chris Dillow at Nomura Research Institute, views on sterling
divide into two camps - those who expect an early base rate cut and those
who expect the Conservatives to fulfil their promise to take sterling into
the narrow band of the ERM at a central rate of DM2.95.
'The former camp are likely to be disappointed,' says Mr Dillow. 'With
German interest rates unlikely to fall until next year, the effective floor
for UK rates will remain high. In this context, cuts in rates by Japan and
the US would not help UK rates down. Indeed, quite the opposite, if they
weaken sterling against the DM.'
Another important factor determining the government's behaviour should be
the memory factor. Mr Nigel Lawson, the then chancellor, eased policy after
the general election in 1987, to, eventually, disastrous effect.

FT  13 APR 92 / Japanese Bonds: Fears eased as Nikkei bounces back
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FEARS of a 'flight from Tokyo', triggered by the recent downswing in
Japanese share prices, were eased by last week's 7 per cent rebound of the
Nikkei stock average.
Japanese bond prices, which were previously depressed by the turmoil in the
Tokyo stock market and rumours of leading overseas investors pulling funds
from Tokyo's financial markets, finally rebounded, ending the week on a
positive note.
After an uneventful March, when financial markets waited for the Bank of
Japan to cut the official discount rate, the bond market saw volatile
movements on low volumes.
Markets tumbled as dealers and investors dismissed the emergency economic
stimulus package, announced on March 31, as ineffective. The yield on the
10-year benchmark bond surged by 39 basis points during the week, the
largest since the Gulf war in August 1990.
The rate cut at the beginning of this month by 75 basis points to 3.75 per
cent, was seen as too late. Some market participants were discouraged, as
the size of the cut suggested the Bank would not consider a further cut
shortly.
However, the gloom and doom in the market seems to have been overdone. 'The
sell-off was a bizarre blip,' said Mr Robert Feldman of Salomon Brothers in
Tokyo. With continued declines in inflation and a slowing economy, Mr
Feldman believes simple long-term government bond yields will fall to around
4.85 per cent in the next few months.
With the government's economic emergency package, which includes
frontloading of 75 per cent of the government's public works projects for
this fiscal year ending March 1993 into the first half of the financial
year, and frontloading capital investments of power companies and other
public utilities, some Y3,000bn of fiscal spending has been moved up into
the first half. As with previous economic stimulus packages, a supplementary
public spending package of around Y5,000bn is expected by the middle of the
year.
Fiscal stimulus could support the bond market, giving participants
confidence in a recovery, allowing companies facing financial difficulties
to solve problems through earnings growth, rather than asset liquidation.
Additional bond issues to fund the supplementary budget is expected to be
minimal. Mr Marshall Gittler at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew in Tokyo reckons the
government would need to issue Y1,700bn in bonds.
However, a long queue of companies waiting to issue straight bond issues
will be an adverse factor. With financing through equity-linked issues
virtually impossible due to the stock market decline, corporations, which in
the next 18 months face redemptions of up to Dollars 111bn in equity-linked
paper raised through Euro markets, are desperate for funds.
With the government ready to allow companies to issue short-term bonds of
under five years, and floating-rate bonds, an increasing number of
corporations are expected to dip into the straight bond market.
Some of the over-supply concerns will be alleviated by an expected increase
in demand. Institutional investors will avert risks by shifting funds into
the bond market.

FT  13 APR 92 / UK Gilts: Tory win sparks surge in demand
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BANK of England has kicked off its gilt funding programme for the
1992-93 financial year at a much healthier rate than it could have envisaged
a week ago, thanks to the surge in the market sparked by the surprise
Conservative election victory.
A massive rise in gilt prices of nearly 4 points on Friday pushed yields
down to levels last seen at the end of February, just before the gloomy
period in the gilt market.
The strength of demand enabled the Bank to sell up to Pounds 4bn worth of
gilts in less than 24 hours, a good start to a financial year in which it
will probably have to find buyers for some Pounds 30bn worth of the
securities to fund Britain's large public sector borrowing requirement.
Including gilt sales already in the pipeline due to Bank actions taken in
the 1991-92 financial year, Threadneedle Street has already accounted for
about Pounds 5bn of the total gilt funding which it will need to arrange
during 1992-93.
A hint of the pace of funding ahead came with Friday's announcement that the
Bank will hold its next gilts auction on April 29. This is expected to be
the first of a programme of auctions which could number one a month over the
next two years. It is likely to invite bids for Pounds 2bn-Pounds 3bn of
stock, in a range of stocks due between 2015 and 2020.
The auction announcement is the first sign that the Bank intends to issue
large amounts of stock at the distant end of the yield curve, where demand
is relatively low due to a shortage of available securities. Issuing large
volumes of such bonds could push down prices and increase yields, leading to
a marked flattening in the currently downward-sloping yield curve. Details
will be announced on April 21.
Underlining the extent of the task ahead for the Bank in funding the PSBR
will be figures due out on Thursday on the borrowing requirement for March,
the final month of the 1991-92 financial year. This is expected to be a huge
Pounds 6.2bn, pushing up the total PSBR for 1991-92 to nearly Pounds 14bn.
In the current financial year, the Treasury expects the borrowing
requirement to be about Pounds 28bn, jumping to Pounds 32bn in 1992-93.
An important question for gilt practitioners is whether the surge in demand
for gilts last week, which was especially marked from foreign investors, can
be sustained in the coming months. Essentially, the Tory election victory
confirmed to gilt investors that the chances of a sterling devaluation are
extremely unlikely.
At their prices on Friday, gilt yields are roughly 1.6 per centage points
above those of comparable German bonds. At the start of last week, as a
result of a depressed four-week period in which gilt yields had been pushed
up by concern about the election outcome, yields were more than 2 percentage
points above those of their German counterparts.
According to projections by UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, the difference between
yields for German and UK bonds will continue to decline, to about 1.4
percentage points by mid-1992 and just 1 percentage point by the end of the
year.
The strength of sterling last week in the wake of the election victory has
sparked speculation that the government may soon cut base rates, held at
10.5 per cent for more than seven months. However, many economists believe
the government is more likely to keep interest rates at their current level
for some months.
It may instead capitalise on the strength of sterling and the newly found
confidence on financial markets to make a decision soon to move sterling to
a narrow, 2.25 per cent band in the exchange rate mechanism, a move that
could accelerate progress in narrowing the UK and German yield differential.

FT  13 APR 92 / US Money and Credit: Good and bad news bring confusion
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GOOD news and bad news suffused the US bond markets in speedy succession
last week. The result was confusion.
The best came first. Bond prices raced higher after the Federal Reserve
moved to lower interest rates on Thursday morning, by adding reserves to the
banking system through a round of overnight system repurchase agreements.
The action came when the Fed funds rate was trading below 4 per cent, and
was immediately interpreted as a decision by the authorities to lower the
rate by 25 basis points. The new target rate stands at 3 3/4 per cent.
It was a signal which the market had been anticipating for months - only to
see its hopes dashed in the past. A week previously, for example, bond
prices rallied when two reports revealed US money supply was shrinking and
employment expanding slowly at best. Speculation that an easing of monetary
policy was in view grew again during the first trading sessions last week.
As a result, the yield on the benchmark long bond slipped to 7.88 per cent
by Tuesday night.
Wednesday, admittedly, brought a sharp reversal, but this was largely thanks
to a Dollars 9.75bn auction of seven-year Treasury notes. Seven-year notes
have a reputation for poor reception among investors, and this issue proved
no exception. By the end of the day, the long bond yield - reflecting
weakness in the market overall  - had risen to 7.91 per cent.
But Thursday, with Fed funds easing, was another story, and the yield on the
30-year bond quickly returned below the 7.9 per cent mark. Yet, even then,
the response at the long end of the market was far less pronounced than
among shorter-term securities - a steepening of the yield curve which
underlined the markets' puzzlement over the timing and size of the interest
rate cut.
The confusion is understandable. On the one hand, those pundits who believe
the economy needs real stimulus to kick-start it, are convinced that the
authorities have sat on the sidelines for too long. The latest move, in
their view, scarcely remedies the situation: a small easing of the Fed funds
rate, for example, is unlikely to generate any change in commercial banks'
lending rates.
'The Fed's move this week was unexpected and hard to justify in terms of the
particulars for its timing - it was about two months late,' commented Mr
Robert Brusca at Nikko Securities. 'It is hard to argue that the move
damaged anything . . . (but) the Fed must learn to link its moves to
events.'
By contrast, those economists who are more sanguine about the economic
prospects, were equally baffled. 'Why so soon?' questioned pundits at Smith
Barney. 'March employment growth was disappointing but total hours worked
held up reasonably well, and private sector surveys suggest some increase in
hiring activity over the months ahead. Private surveys of the March retail
sales situation also were downtrodden, but the chain store sales data for
March didn't seem as bad; it was essentially a mixed bag.'
Twenty-four hours later, when the March consumer price inflation data
arrived, the situation was muddied further. The consumer price index report
showed a 0.5 per cent rise, significantly higher than the 0.3 per cent rise
which experts were predicting. The so-called 'core' rate for March - which
excludes energy and food prices  - rose 0.5 per cent.
The bond markets' knee-jerk reaction was to plunge by more than half a
point, before deciding that - given all the other economic news recently -
this was really not so bad. By the end of the week, the long bond yield had
rallied sufficiently to stand at 7.88 per cent, from the 7.87 per cent a
week earlier.
Next week's smattering of statistics will include March retail sales,
projected to be flat to modestly lower (partly because of Easter's timing),
and industrial production for the same month. The latter is forecast to show
a very small rise - perhaps 0.2 per cent, after a 0.6 per cent gain in
February - with the capacity utilisation rate unchanged.
No doubt, the figures will be examined from every angle. Whether they
clarify the meaning of the Fed's latest move, and hence give the market a
better sense of whether further easing can be expected, is another matter
altogether.

<TEXT>
HACHIDAI Corporation, an apartment and resort developer, has been been
declared insolvent by Japanese credit research agencies, following the
suspension of bank transactions with the ailing company, which has
outstanding debts of Y114bn (Dollars 858m).
The collapse of Hachidai, also a dealer in golf club memberships and a
hospital proprietor, is the fourth largest in Japan this year, and shows
that Japanese banks are not willing to restructure all troubled clients,
particularly those with heavy exposure in the property market.
The three largest bankruptcies so far this year have been linked to the
Koshin stock speculators group, with the largest failure that of KSG, which
had Y142.4bn in outstanding debts. Mr Mitsuhiro Kotani, the Koshin head
charged with allegedly manipulating stock prices, was declared bankrupt
earlier this week with personal debts of Y122.5bn
Banks are wary of con-tinuing their relationships with scandal-tainted
companies, and Hachidai was linked to a controversy involving the alleged
mismanagement of its hospital in December last year.
The company, along with many other mid-sized property developers, has been
hurt by the higher interest rates and the fall in apartment and golf club
membership prices, as well by a finance ministry order that banks limit
property-related lending.

SULZER, the Swiss engineering group, has revealed a 23 per cent fall in last
year's net consolidated earnings to SFr119m (Dollars 78.8m) from SFr155m in
1990. Turnover was up 4 per cent to SFr6.5bn.
The company blamed the profits fall on 'serious losses' at the Sulzer Ruti
weaving machinery division. In spite of deteriorating economic conditions,
the three divisions concerned with medical technology, plant and building
services, and paper technology, hydraulics and turbines ended the year 'with
very good results'. The Winterthur power systems and locomotive works also
achieved a good result despite high losses in foundry operations.
Net earnings of the parent company, Sulzer Brothers, fell to SFr48m in 1991
from SFr60m in 1990.
The board proposes to cut the dividend to SFr130 from SFr150 per registered
share with a nominal value of SFr1,000, and to SFr13 from SFr15 for
registered shares and participation certificates with a par value of SFr100.
In March the company said it was opening its share ledger to foreigners. The
annual meeting in May will be asked to approve a 10-for-1 share split of
registered shares with a nominal value of SFr1,000.
In January Sulzer said orders for the group had risen 2 per cent in 1991 to
SFr6.4bn, but this mainly reflected strong growth for the medical technology
division, Sulzermedica. Orders for weaving machinery and foundries fell.
SMH (Societe Suisse de Microelectronique et d'Horlogerie), the Swiss
watchmaker best known for the Swatch plastic watch and Omega and Rado luxury
brands, boosted net consolidated earnings by 32 per cent to SFr252m in 1991.
Turnover rose 10.9 per cent to SFr2.37bn, while sales of watches and
movements jumped 34 per cent.

THOMSON-CSF of France, the state-controlled defence group and
Washington-based Carlyle Group have won the war for control of LTV's missile
and aerospace businesses with a joint offer worth Dollars 450m.
The US bankruptcy court ruled on Friday that the Thomson-Carlyle bid was
'the highest and best offer,' beating a Dollars 385m joint bid from two US
defence companies - Martin Marietta and Lockheed.
LTV has been operating under Chapter 11 of the US bankruptcy code since 1986
and requires the court's approval to dispose of any assets.
Thomson and Carlyle, an investment company headed by Mr Frank Carlucci, a
former US defence secretary, came into the contest after LTV had agreed to
sell the businesses to Vought Corporation, a joint venture between Lockheed

Thomson will pay Dollars 300m in cash for the missiles business, with Hughes
Aircraft, a General Motors unit, buying a 15 per cent stake in that
business.

<TEXT>
GROUPE Victoire, the French insurance company owned by Compagnie Financiere
de Suez, staged a modest recovery from a steep fall in profits during the
first half of 1991 to report a slight reduction in net profits of 1.7 per
cent to FFr1.81bn (Dollars 320m) for the full year.
During the first half of 1991, Victoire experienced a 33 per cent decline in
net profits to FFr924m because of a reduction in exceptional gains. The
company had benefited from substantial asset sales in the first half of 1990
to fund the acquisition of Colonia, the German insurance group.
The company made a mild recovery in the second half, but did not achieve the
goal outlined by Mr Jean Arvis, chairman, when the interim results were
published, of equalling or slightly increasing its 1990 profits.
Victoire said yesterday it had been affected by the global downturn in the
insurance market during 1991, particularly by the increase in business
claims in France and Germany.
The group's turnover rose by 9.7 per cent to FFr64bn in 1991. Net profits
before paying minority interests rose by 2.9 per cent to FFr2.2bn. The board
proposed raising the dividend from FFr15 in 1990 to FFr19.50 for 1991.

FT  13 APR 92 / UK Company News: New generation looks to the future - The
recession-battered UK mortgage market
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
AFTER THREE years of recession in the housing market the UK mortgage
business is littered with the corpses of former hopefuls who entered it at
the height of the 1980s mortgage boom.
No fewer than thirty mortgage portfolios belonging to smaller lenders are
currently on the market.
Some of the stars of the 1980s mortgage market, such as National Home Loans
and The Mortgage Corporation, have more or less put lending on a backburner
for the time being.
Others have given up completely. Chase Manhattan sold its mortgage business
to the Household Mortgage Corporation last year, while Canadian Imperial
Bank of Commerce has been seeking a buyer for many months.
Prior to this some American banks, such as Chemical Bank and Bank of
America, abandoned the UK mortgage market even before the housing boom had
ended because of balance sheet pressures in the US. Citybank, however, one
of the survivors, has remained in the market. Little is also heard these
days from United Bank of Kuwait and Sumitomo, the two foreign banks which
attracted widespread publicity in the mid-1980s by undercutting other
mortgage lenders.
However, one group of recent entrants to the UK mortgage market shows no
signs of folding its tents. It is the group of banks from mainland Europe,
mostly from France, which entered the market in the late 1980s with a view
to learning about the British mortgage industry in advance of 1993 and the
Single European Market.
'We want to be in most of the European Community countries and this is the
best mortgage market in Europe, with more transactions and a higher
percentage of home ownership than anywhere else. It is also the easiest to
get into since there are fewer government restrictions,' says Mr James
Schoedinger, chairman of UCB, a French mortgage and commercial lender, owned
by Compagnie Bancaire and the Paribas Group.
UCB entered the UK mortgage market in 1986 by buying up Commercial Credit's
mortgage operation which then had a book of Pounds 200m. It now has 16
branches and a mortgage book of Pounds 2.7bn which would put it nearly half
way up the table of the top twenty building societies.
Other French banks in the UK mortgage market include Credit Agricole, with a
book of Pounds 600m; BNP, which bought Chemical Bank's mortgage book in 1989
and now has a book of Pounds 2bn, Credit Fonciere and Societe Generale. The
last two are represented by a joint venture called Capital Home Loans which
has a book of Pounds 200m.
The stream of new recruits has not dried up. Credit Lyonnais is currently
setting up a UK mortgage operation, to be run by Mr Alan Guyatt, the former
manager of Chase Manhattan's mortgage operation. French banks have been able
to enter the UK market and stay in it partly because most of them are
state-owned institutions which are not under the same capital constraints as
their competitors in other countries.
But they are not alone. One Italian Bank, San Paolo, remains in the UK
market and another Italian housing finance specialist institution says that
it is still contemplating entering the UK.
Scandinavia is represented by Mortgage Trust, owned by Scandinavian Bank,
with a mortgage book of around Pounds 1bn.
Hypo-Bank, Germany's second largest mortgage lender, also entered the UK
market in 1989 as Mortgage Services and has since built up a sizeable
lending book of about Pounds 1.5bn.
'It was difficult to get the business at that time but we have also had
fewer problems than the earlier entrants did. We want to expand into a high
quality long-term book,' says Mr Peter Sewell, managing director of MSL.
MSL has kept a low profile in the UK market partly because Germany has a
highly regulated housing finance system which, unlike France or Spain, most
foreign banks have so far regarded as an almost impossible tough nut to
crack - Single Market or no Single Market. 'There are a lot of lessons to be
learned on both sides. The UK can learn a lot about fixed rate mortgages
from the Germans,' says Mr Sewell.
The Europeans in the UK mortgage market have learned some painful lessons
themselves. Last year UCB made a profit of around Pounds 6m on its mortgage
business, but not everyone has found it so easy.
Like the other 1980s specialist mortgage companies, the UK mortgage
subsidiaries of the European banks sold most of their mortgages via the life
assurance industry and panels of intermediaries. This was the sort of
lending which later turned out to be most risky.
Mr Pierre Dardalhon, chief executive of Capital Home Loans, says: 'We are
not a money-losing operation, but it is difficult to make a profit in this
market.' Mr John Schuster, chief executive of BNP Mortgage, says that all
the European lenders are now going for quality.
They all look set to stay in the UK. Though none of the other lenders can
rival UCB's 16 branches and 700 staff, most now have substantial presences
in the UK. Even the newest entrant, Credit Lyonnais, has an existing network
of eight branches handling corporate business. A generation of mainland
European bankers is growing up with personal experience of life in the UK
markets.
The unspoken question among many British banks and building societies is how
long will it take before at least some of these continental mortgage
operations develop into springboards for full scale retail banking
operations.

FT  13 APR 92 / UK Company News: Harland and Wolff makes Pounds 4m
provisions
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
HARLAND AND Wolff, the Belfast shipbuilder, made a profit of Pounds 2.11m in
1991, after Pounds 3.96m exceptional provisions.
Mr John Parker, chairman and chief executive, said Pounds 2.5m was
restructuring costs to cover redundancies, as the shipping side reshapes
during 1992 from a mixed naval and merchant builder to a series build
merchant operation.
There were also one time provisions in Trassey Shipping for costs which were
previously expected to be incurred over four years as the Knock Ardy traded.
The exceptionals were on top of a Pounds 4.4m operating loss, but the
aggregate deficit was offset by interest received of Pounds 11m.
A redemption premium of Pounds 12m paid by the DED on the termination of its
obligations under the recourse agreement pushed net profit up to Pounds
12.6m. Earnings per share were 3.8p and the final dividend is 2p for a total
of 5.5p.
The extended programme on the AOR vessel added substantially to costs in the
protective coatings and technical services companies as they both operate on
fixed price contracts. The ship repair side and outfit service company had
positive results. Electrical services results were unsatisfactory.
In the 18 months to December 31 1990 the group made a pre-tax profit of
Pounds 11.7m.

FT  13 APR 92 / UK Company News: March chairman resigns as losses increase
sharply to Pounds 4m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MARCH Group, which last year sold its specialist racing car and engineering
businesses and has been under share suspension from the USM since last July,
has announced increased losses and the resignation of its chairman, Mr John
Cowen.
In the year ended October 31 1991 pre-tax losses were Pounds 3.97m (Pounds
1.3m).
There were also extraordinary debits of Pounds 1.67m (Pounds 1.85m) stemming
from losses on the disposal of the motor racing business, provisions for a
subsidiary in receivership and legal costs. That resulted in a loss per
share of 12.7p (5.4p).
Mr Cowen retired on Friday and is being replaced as non-executive chairman
by Mr David Cunningham, a corporate financier. Williams de Broe, the
stockbroker, has also proposed, and had accepted, the appointment of two
businessmen as executive directors.
March has finished winding down Cobbold Roach, the Southampton stockbroker
acquired from Elders IXL. During March's ten months of ownership, Cobbold
ran up more than Pounds 1m in losses and was made 'virtually worthless' by a
major fraud, the company said. Although most of Cobbald's liabilities have
been met, some small claims are outstanding, leading to the freezing of some
surplus cash balances.
Two court cases involving March have been settled out of court, although
both led to lower than hoped for awards to March. Early this year, the
company accepted a Pounds 2.1m settlement from Alfa Lancia which followed a
disputed contract. An earlier settlement of Dollars 750,000 had been agreed
with Patrick Racing in a related dispute.

<TEXT>
DAVIS SERVICE group, the business services company formerly known as Godfrey
Davis, has taken a further step away from its previous focus of vehicle hire
and dealership with the sale of its contract hire subsidiary for Pounds
5.75m.
Davis is selling Godfrey Davis (Contract Hire), which operates more than
11,500 vehicles, to NWS Bank, a subsidiary of the Bank of Scotland. The
price compares with a net asset value of Pounds 5.6m. The division reported
reduced profits after interest charges of Pounds 800,000 (Pounds 2.6m) in
1991 as clients reduced their fleets.
The disposal follows the sale last May of three of Davis' four Ford
dealerships. The remaining outlet is in St Albans, and the company has
expressed interest in selling that. Davis' other divisions are involved in
cleaning, work wear and site services.

FT  13 APR 92 / UK Company News: CRA facing difficult year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRUCE JACQUES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SYDNEY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CRA, the Australian mining house, faces further earnings difficulties in
1992 following the net profit fall from Dollars A472.5m to Dollars A350m in
1991.
Mr John Uhrig, the chairman, and Mr John Ralph, managing director, have
outlined another year of pressure in the annual report.
Mr Ralph said it would be imprudent to try to anticipate the timing of a
recovery in metal prices and demand. 'In the medium to long-term, the
recovery of the principal economies and the reconstruction of the Eastern
European economies should see metal prices rise,' he claimed.
"However, the immediate effect of the changes occuring in Eastern Europe and
the former USSR has been to increase the amount of metal in world markets,
swelling inventories and dampening prices.
"While no resource company can escape the global influence of diminished
economic growth rates, the CRA group is favourably placed in relation to its
international competition."
Mr Uhrig said there was unlikely to be a marked improvement in demand for
the company's products in 1992. 'However, the far from favourable conditions
which persisted during 1991 still saw some significant improvements in
several of CRA's businesses.
'I am confident that similar gains in efficiency will be sought and obtained
throughout the CRA business units in the current year."
Gearing remained among the lowest of any Australian resource company,
although rising from 20 to 25 per cent.

FT  13 APR 92 / Reichmann to ask for 90-day grace on debts: O&amp;Y founder to
unveil 10-year repayment plan in Toronto today
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON and BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Paul Reichmann will today make an offer to 100 banks which he hopes that
they cannot refuse. The founder of the world's biggest property developer,
Olympia &amp; York Developments, will ask the banks at an afternoon meeting in
Toronto's Sheraton hotel to reschedule principal and interest payments on
between USDollars 4bn (Pounds 2.2bn) and Dollars 5bn of loans.
O&amp;Y will warn that if the banks refuse they risk unbearable losses on
Dollars 12bn, which is the debt in all O&amp;Y companies, excluding its
non-property subsidiaries. Those loans are less than some analysts believed.
Nonetheless, if O&amp;Y were to have asked for a reconstruction of all that,
some banks could have been in difficulties.
O&amp;Y does not expect the banks to give agreement to the plan without months
of wrangling.
As a first step, O&amp;Y wants a 90-day period of grace during which principal
payments will be frozen and some interest will be deferred. The final plan
will, however, involve rescheduling principal and rolling up interest to the
end of the decade.
This famously secretive company will make a detailed presentation of how the
crisis evolved and its long-term prospects. Banks will receive hundreds of
pages of financial documents. There will also be speeches from Mr Steve
Miller, partner in investment bank James D Wolfensohn Inc, and from O&amp;Y's
key managers, such as Mr Michael Dennis, in charge of O&amp;Y's UK operations,
which are at the heart of the company's difficulties.
Whenever a company asks for a financial reconstruction, banks are forced by
regulators to make big provisions to cover the risk of losses on loans to
that company. O&amp;Y is bending over backwards to minimise the provisions banks
will have to make. It hopes to convince them that in time they will be
repaid in full.
'The rationale behind the restructuring is that everyone eventually gets 100
per cent', said a source close to the talks between O&amp;Y and its banks, which
are led by Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, Citicorp of the US and
Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation.
Banks will be told that O&amp;Y's net assets, at market value, are between
Dollars 5bn and Dollars 5.5bn. The balance sheet value of those assets,
based on their cost rather than their market worth, is Dollars 4bn.
Both those figures are calculated on the assumption that O&amp;Y remains out of
liquidation. If there were a fire sale of its properties and shareholdings,
it is by no means certain that the proceeds would cover its borrowings.
O&amp;Y is so influential in certain markets, such as the Manhattan office
market, that if it collapsed, the effect on prices would be devastating.
It is confident that by the late 1990s, an economic upswing will push up
both rental income from its properties and the value of the buildings
themselves. The banks may question some of those assumptions.
Of the debt to be rescheduled, only Dollars 300m is unsecured. The Dollars
4bn to Dollars 5bn being renegotiated has four main elements:
Dollars 2.5bn provided by a banking syndicate.
Another Dollars 500m in a separate syndicated loan.
Dollars 300m in working capital lines.
Around Dollars 1bn borrowed to finance the construction of Canary Wharf in
London's docklands.
Around 50 banks in all, out of O&amp;Y's 100 banks, will be affected by the
rescheduling. O&amp;Y's future depends in part on whether they can be persuaded
that it is fair that the remaining 50 will not be asked to make sacrifices.
Mr Reichmann wants to insulate all debt outside the central holding company
from the reconstruction. Banks which have provided finance for individual
property developments in the US and Canada - totalling Dollars 5.8bn for the
US properties and USDollars 1.8bn for the Canadian - will not be asked to
reschedule, since rental income from most of these properties will be
sufficient to service the loans. O&amp;Y will also argue that the interests of
lenders to the parent will be damaged if the property finance is
renegotiated. It will note that the intrinsic value of the parent rests on
its reputation for honouring all its commitments on individual buildings.
However, some lenders may be convinced that O&amp;Y's reputation has already
been damaged considerably. They may ask what more they have to lose by
pulling the rug.
'If we have to reschedule', they may argue, 'everyone has to reschedule'.
Mr Reichmann has to convince them that threat would be suicidal.

FT  13 APR 92 / Lloyd's may form fund to aid Names
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LLOYD'S OF LONDON may set up a market fund to help Names - the individuals
whose assets back underwriting at the insurance market - hardest hit by the
market's recent heavy losses, Mr David Coleridge, Lloyd's chairman,
confirmed yesterday.
A number of schemes have been examined and it is possible that Mr Coleridge
could recommend the adoption of one of them at a meeting of the Council, the
market's governing body, later this month.
Mr Coleridge said he didn't want to 'raise expectations' but he was 'looking
very carefully to see if there was a scheme he could recommend'.
The fund would be designed to cap the losses of hundreds of Names incurred
by their participation in syndicates specialising in catastrophe
reinsurance.
Syndicates managed by Feltrim, Gooda Walker and other agencies ran up half
the market's 1989 loss of over Pounds 1.35bn, which Lloyd's will report in
June.
Many are involved in litigation either against Lloyd's or their agents.
'For Lloyd's to be seen to be looking after its walking wounded would be
well received around the world,' said Mr Coleridge.
'One has to look at these schemes. It is humane and necessary,' he added.
'If I wasn't looking at it I would not be doing my duty.'
Mr Coleridge said he had been considering the idea for some months. Cost was
a problem - the fund would need to be financed by the market as a whole,
possibly by a levy on members.
But as a condition of benefiting, Names would agree to drop litigation
either against Lloyd's or their agents. As part of the deal Lloyd's would
establish a new arbitration procedure to handle disputes.
'If negligence were found this would still have to be paid for,' said Mr
Coleridge,
Over 2,000 Names are currently involved in legal action.
The Commercial Court meets today in the fourth day of an action brought by
820 Names seeking injunctions to prevent Lloyd's from drawing down from
their deposits to meet cash calls.
A new grouping of Names, formed last week by representatives of action
groups, can be expected to participate in any negotiations about a deal.

FT  13 APR 92 / A victim of hubris falls at Canary Wharf
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON and BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Olympia &amp; York was a victim of hubris, 300 bankers representing 100 banks
will be told today. In 1988, it appeared to be the strongest property
company in the world. Its net assets were worth CDollars 11bn (Pounds 5.3bn)
and parent company borrowings were less than CDollars 2bn. That gave Mr Paul
Reichmann the confidence to make the biggest gamble of his career: the
creation of a financial city in London's docklands at Canary Wharf.
It started work that year on a dozen Canary Wharf buildings simultaneously.
If O&amp;Y had followed traditional practice in the property industry, it would
have brought in partners, or arranged bank finance before construction work
started. But given its strength in North America, it chose to do neither.
It went solo, using its own resources for the initial development, planning
to bring in partners and project finance at a later stage. In the succeeding
three years, O&amp;Y spent USDollars 3bn (Pounds 1.70bn) on the project from its
own resources. By 1990, it was ready to raise finance from banks for
individual buildings directly without recourse to its own balance sheet. But
by then, the market for property finance had dried up, thanks in part to the
unease caused by Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.
O&amp;Y was caught in a double squeeze. The value of its US and Canadian
properties was falling. Cash flow from its non-property investments, such as
the forest products group Abitibi-Price, was dwindling as well. Because of
Canary Wharf, group borrowings were rising sharply. It did raise a Pounds
500m facility from a club of 10 banks specifically for Canary Wharf in
November 1990, but even this was guaranteed by the parent. Far more money
was needed. In the second half of 1991, it was close to getting Pounds 300m,
secured against the main Canary Wharf Tower, from another club of banks. But
one bank dropped out and the deal collapsed. This was the straw that broke
O&amp;Y's back. From the beginning of February to early March, Mr Reichmann
tried every device he knew to raise cash.
He persuaded a group of Canadian banks, led by Canadian Imperial Bank of
Commerce, to provide Dollars 240m for a couple of years, until the property
financing market recovered. But before the funds were actually advanced to
O&amp;Y, the company faced a rapid depletion of its cash resources. Investors
were refusing to repurchase commercial paper, or short-term debt securities,
after a credit rating agency, Dominion Bond Rating Services, issued a gloomy
assessment of O&amp;Y's credit-worthiness.
To add insult to injury, one of the banks in the Dollars 240m syndicate
questioned whether the money should be provided. The bank feared the funds
would be used to redeem commercial paper.
By this stage, Mr Reichmann was exploring every avenue for raising funds. To
allay the fears of the banking syndicate, he talked to investment bankers
about the possibility of selling non-property assets. Almost immediately
afterwards, there was a wave of rumours that O&amp;Y was in serious financial
difficulties. O&amp;Y decided to sell Interprovincial PipeLine and shares in
that oil pipeline company were suspended.
This move was widely misunderstood. The chairman of a big Far Eastern bank
rang Mr Reichmann to warn him that he had heard O&amp;Y was bankrupt. The
rumours made it inevitable that holders of all CDollars 800m of O&amp;Y's
commercial paper would want their money back. At the same time, three
attempts by O&amp;Y to raise funds in London - Pounds 250m from an Enterprise
Zone unit trust, Dollars 300m from a loan on a building let to the US
investment bank Morgan Stanley and Pounds 250m from selling bonds secured
against the Canary Wharf Tower - all collapsed. By mid-March Mr Reichmann
had no doubts about the cost of his Canary Wharf gamble. For the first time
in his career, he would have to admit to the banks that O&amp;Y could not pay
its debts on time.

FT  13 APR 92 / Japanese banks hit Basle threshold
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE latest decline of Tokyo equity prices has left many Japanese banks short
of international capital adequacy standards which come into full force next
year.
A report by IBCA, the London-based credit rating agency which specialises in
the banking sector, said that the fall in the Nikkei stock market index
below 17,000 last week left virtually all Japanese banks below the 8 per
cent capital-to-assets ratio demanded by the Basle Accord on international
capital adequacy.
Analysts at Daiwa Securities in London also calculate that the average
capital ratio of Japanese banks is now just below the threshold demanded by
the international agreement.
IBCA noted that a fall in the Nikkei to around the 15,000 level would wipe
out the hidden reserves of some banks, including Bank of Tokyo, forcing them
to take valuation losses by writing down equity investments.
'If the authorities were to rigidly insist on maintaining capital ratios,
the Japanese banks would have to dramatically reduce lending. They have
already done this on the international scene but so far there are no signs
of a credit crunch in Japan,' the report said.
There are no international sanctions in place against banks which fail to
meet the Basle targets.
However, regulators are already concerned that they have inadequate control
over foreign bank branches operating in their jurisdiction.

   From Mr JOHN CHEELE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Re Mr Bob Garratt's letter (April 8), if we are moved to have our
corporations directed by boards of professional governors rather than of
promoted operational managers, and are still not prepared to adopt 'twin
boards', then we need clearly to define and separate the often incompatible
roles of governing and managing.
Perhaps we could now consider clear role separation by adopting a convention
that a significant majority of a board's members cannot also be employees of
their company - moving towards the upper, non-executive tier of twin boards,
but preserving scope for companies to evolve their own specific board
structures.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I would not like your readers to retain the impression that Ms Reed's
experience of registering with the Securities and Futures Authority was
necessarily typical (Management: 'Financial stamp of disapproval', April 7).
I am also a one-person business. Recently, after being made redundant, I
registered with the SFA as an investment adviser, but also not to handle
client money, nor to deal with the general public.
It was clear from the application forms that the fee was non-refundable:
this is part of the cost of starting up in business. Lawyers' and
accountants' fees were also incurred, but were kept to a minimum by having
them review my own work. It was, after all, my future business plan.
It was also clear from the documentation that my accountants would also need
to be approved, but they registered in parallel with my application. I did
not find the process onerous, but did follow the SFA's advice of submitting
all the details at the same time.
In my experience, the SFA provided constructive and timely assistance
throughout. I was elected to membership just four months from receiving the
first information package.

FT  13 APR 92 / A self-righteous orgy of purging the perks: Public anger
over the privileges enjoyed by American government officials
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In 1977, when he first came to Washington as President Jimmy Carter's press
secretary, Jody Powell was asked if he intended to have a portable phone
installed in his car, a decrepit VW beetle. 'Nah,' he drawled, 'it couldn't
stand the extra weight,' and everybody laughed.
Nobody is laughing now at the weight that is dragging Washington's name
through the mud. The debate is over whether 'this town' (local cave dwellers
never call it anything else) is so stuffed to the gills with the perquisites
of office that it has lost all touch with the reality that is the lives of
average Americans.
This kind of puritanism is not exactly new. Sherman Adams, President
Eisenhower's right hand, had to resign for accepting a free fur coat; the
G-man himself, J Edgar Hoover, got into deep trouble for having free window
valances installed; and the fall of John Sununu, President Bush's White
House chief of staff, was pretty much determined when it became known last
year that he used government aircraft as lesser mortals might taxis.
Some administrations have tried to set an honourable example. Mr Carter, for
example, stipulated economy-class air travel. But the sight of Paul Volcker,
the then chairman of the Federal Reserve, miserably curling his
six-and-a-half-foot frame into a back seat, unlit stogie in hand, while on
missions to save the dollar did not have the desired effect. Others have not
even bothered; the 'sleaze factor' was notorious in the Teflon Reagan years,
even to the point of the First Lady soliciting contributions for the upkeep
of her ballgowns.
But this year the unpopularity of 'this town' in the nation knows no bounds.
Add to this some vicious election-season partisan politics and there emerges
the extraordinary spectacle of a self-righteous orgy of purging the perk. It
should be funny, and sometimes is, if it were not taken quite so seriously.
Congress is the most defensive because it has seemed to be the main
offender, as anyone listening to a radio phone-in programme realises within
three minutes. In the wake of revelations that the House bank never bounced
cheques, and of charges that its post office delivered cocaine more
efficiently than letters, all the little things that make the congressional
life a touch easier are under scrutiny. They include subsidised restaurants,
hair cuts and gymnasia, free potted plants and subscription drugs, gratis
parking at the Capitol and at local airports, the fixing of any tickets, and
wholesale price gifts and knick-knacks.
In the aggregate, and excepting the abuse of the House bank, they do not
appear to amount to anything that is not commonly provided for executives in
the corporate sector, including the media. But abuses have inevitably
occurred; last year, for example, it emerged there were Dollars 300,000 in
unpaid bills owing at the House restaurants, which is a little steep for a
canteen.
Any increase in the salaries of Congress, which decides its own pay,
invariably invites public criticism. At Dollars 129,500 a year now, these
are not bad by national standards, except that many members have to support
homes both in Washington and their own constituencies, which explains why
this year an abnormal number are retiring to go out and make real money. The
lobbyists and lawyers with whom they routinely mingle in this town are
usually paid a lot more.
Tom Foley, speaker of the House, finally decided he had had enough of these
assaults on an institution he loves so much. His counter-attack is that
people in glass houses (Republicans and the White House, not, of course, the
public) should not throw stones. He chose not to stoop so low as to take
away the free car from his chief congressional tormentor, Newt Gingrich, the
Republican whip (at least not yet, though if Mr Gingrich goes on much more
about 'institutional corruption' he will be lucky to find a rack for his
bicycle). But in ordering an investigation into the perks enjoyed by the
executive branch it looks as though he does not intend to spare even the
president.
Mr George Bush's perks are not insubstantial, as a recent Washington Post
article pointed out. They run to a Dollars 7.26m annual operating budget for
the White House itself, covering nearly 100 domestic employees - including
five florists, spending Dollars 200,000 a year on displays, and five
calligraphers, presumably deciphering the presidential scrawl. There is also
in the official residence a bowling alley, cinema, swimming pool, putting
green (Vice-President Dan Quayle recently had a high-tech version with
variable breaks installed in his mansion), tennis courts, a basketball court
and a horseshoe pit; and a free box at the Kennedy Centre for the performing
arts.
There is Camp David and there is, of course, Air Force One (there are
actually two of them, specially modified Boeing 747s) and a constant supply
of helicopters, which is the most seductive of all. When asked what he would
miss most on ceasing to be president, Lyndon Johnson wordlessly waved an arm
at the helicopter pad on the White House lawn.
Mr Foley's more tangible target is the staff of the executive branch and
indeed it appears that, outside the cabinet, senior officials enjoy a range
of privileges pretty similar to those of Congress. Among them is the
provision of home-to-office limousine services for nine White House
heavyweights. Unfortunately for Mr Foley, it transpired that this privilege
had been authorised (surprise, surprise) by Congress itself.
Also under the gun are frequent flyer programmes. Congress last year
specifically allowed its members and staff to use mileage accrued on
official business for their personal use, on the grounds, possibly now
questionable, that this was the norm in the private sector. The executive
branch, it appears, has no policy governing frequent flying and, if it had,
you can be sure Mr Sununu would have used it to the hilt. Congress, however,
has been obliged to put limits on the outside income its members may earn in
honoraria; curiously, a federal judge last month ruled that the ban on civil
servants supplementing their incomes in this way was unlawful.
This fixation with perks, while the stuff of good 'n' dirty politics,
completely misses the point. There is something wrong with the governance of
America, but it is not simply because those who govern have grown fat and
greedy. The root causes are complex, but must include the unrealistic
personal standards asked of public figures and the decline in the
controlling influence of the two main parties. The two have led to the
absence of leaders of quality and a fragmentation of the body politic.
As Senator Warren Rudman, the New Hampshire Republican, explained when he
bowed out last month, the system is not working and real issues are being
ducked. If it were, and they were not, no one would be wailing over free
potted plants and floral displays.

FT  13 APR 92 / Letter: Top executive pay schemes must be effective and
'transparent'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr KEVIN O'SULLIVAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your leader, 'How to pay top executives' (April 8), was timely and
important.
The key principle, as you say, must be to align directors' interests with
those of shareholders. A simple system is best. A basic salary paid at
market rates, supplemented by a bonus arithmetically related to earnings per
share (EPS) is effective, easily understood and 'transparent' (an important
quality). Bonuses of this kind should be generous where performance is good,
so that the EPS-related component will sometimes represent a large
proportion of a successful manager's earnings.
For smaller companies, a system of employee shareholding reaching down to
key people well below board level is an excellent motivator, either in
addition to, or instead of, such a scheme. Such a system, by requiring
directors and staff to pay for their shares, and thereby to take on the full
responsibilities of ownership, is far more conducive to responsible
management than an option scheme. A share option scheme is a one-way bet
(you can win, but you can't lose, and you stake nothing) which can encourage
people merely to 'have a punt on the firm' rather than to settle down to
build it.

FT  13 APR 92 / Personal View: Markets and community
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WILLETTS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is not only the pollsters who got the election wrong. Equally mistaken
were those commentators who argued there was no sharp difference of
principle between the two main parties. They did not grasp the nature of
modern Conservatism, nor how it differs even from the air-brushed,
deodorised socialism of Neil Kinnock's Labour party.
Both parties did, of course, try to reach out to the floating voters who
finally determined the result. Ever since his first speech at the
Conservative party conference as chancellor, John Major has repeatedly said
that he wants the party to reach out to all. Neil Kinnock wanted the Labour
party to escape from its shrinking unionised base to take in the prosperous,
including those working in the service industries. Mr Major succeeded, and
Mr Kinnock failed. That is because of a fundamental difference in the
Conservative and Labour understanding of how a nation is held together.
For Labour, the task of integration is, above all, for the state. Even after
all its policy reviews, it remained the party of high spending, high taxes
and more regulation, that is, big government.
The first objection to these beliefs is that they undermine the operation of
the free market, which had to be fought for in the 1980s. But there is
another deeper objection. Big government does not bring the nation together;
it divides it. Interest groups are engaged in a struggle for taxpayers'
money and special favours - with the state as the battlefield. John Smith's
shadow budget was a classic example of the perils of such an approach. He
doubtless thought he was being politically ingenious by hitting one-sixth of
the working population with the biggest post-war tax increase to finance
small electoral bribes for the rest. But, if a highwayman robs your
neighbour, you may fear it will be your turn next. Many electors were afraid
a future Labour government would raise their taxes too.
Instead, the prime minister has a very different and authentically Tory view
of what holds the community together - culture. This is not simply high
culture, but, as T S Eliot observed: 'It includes all the characteristic
activities and interests of a people: Derby Day, Henley Regatta, Cowes, the
12th of August, a cup final, the dog races, the pin table, the dartboard,
Wensleydale cheese, boiled cabbage cut into sections, beetroot in vinegar,
19th-century Gothic churches, and the music of Elgar.' The prominence given
to David Mellor's new ministry, bringing together everything from
Manchester's Olympic bid to the Royal Opera House and the BBC, recognises
the power of culture in its broadest sense, in sustaining national identity.
The constitution is also part of this shared culture. Only the most absurd
reactionary would suggest it is so perfect as never to require further
change. But, equally, the Labour and Liberal Democrat parties seemed
afflicted with an itch to intervene everywhere. Having lost the intellectual
battle on detailed intervention in the economy, their restless spirits
wanted to fiddle with the constitution instead. Regional government,
devolution, new quangos and commissions, a new bill of rights together would
have meant years of constitutional turmoil, with little practical gain.
Conservatives fought the election as the only party prepared to speak out
for the traditional strengths of the British constitution.
Another striking feature of the election campaign was how the public sector
unions from Nupe to the Inland Revenue staff federation devoted their funds
to advertising against the Conservatives. They may have thought they were
helping Labour, but in practice they aroused suspicions that Labour's
much-vaunted commitment to the welfare state was really just to the unions
within it. By contrast, the reforms of health and education and the
Citizen's Charter all aligned the Conservatives with the vast majority, who
are users of the public services and have a shared interest in higher
standards and consumer responsiveness.
While one threat to the sense of community comes from interventionism and
egalitarianism, another comes from snobs who believe that British culture
does not belong to all, but to a narrow elite. The destruction of
traditional education in the 1960s and 1970s was only possible because
people in power believed that Dickens or Shakespeare or the Tudors and
Stuarts or the rules of English grammar were only for the privileged few.
The snobs thus played into the hands of the progressives. We can only
protect what we value by trying to make it the birthright of everyone. That
is perhaps the reason for the fervour with which the prime minister and
education secretary have fought for good quality traditional education to be
available to all.
The task now for Conservatives is to set this belief in community alongside
a commitment to the free market. Together they form the bedrock of
Conservatism for the 1990s, as they have done throughout its history.
The author is the newly-elected MP for Havant. His book Modern Conservatism
was published last month by Penguin.

FT  13 APR 92 / Carrot and stick for middle classes: John Major may want to
edge economic policies toward the centre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARRY RILEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Britain's middle classes can breathe again. Neil Kinnock, with his 59 per
cent income taxes, did not get the key to Number 10 Downing Street after
all. He will not be given the chance to threaten the incomes, the lifestyle
and the house prices of the well-off.
But even John Major, planning his strategy for a five-year term as prime
minister, may need to rethink some of the tenets of Thatcherism. He will not
wish to leave room for another class-based attack on the Conservatives in
1996 or 1997. True, Britain's recent poor economic performance has not had
the anticipated fatal consequences for Mr Major and his government, but he
would be foolish to rely on repeated opposition failure.
It was quite a scare for the middle classes, who feared that they would be
wide open to high marginal tax rates in the absence of the myriad tax breaks
and allowances that used to protect them in the 1970s. Their self-confidence
has anyway been slipping under the burden of slumping house prices and the
decimation by bankruptcy of the small business sector. These are the people
who run the country: they are the managers, the professionals, the higher
civil servants and the successful businessmen. Under Margaret Thatcher the
Conservatives had swept to power three times - twice with Commons majorities
of more than 100 - on the theme that low income taxes, free markets and the
encouragement of individual enterprise would transform the British economy.
The muddled corporatism of the 1970s had failed.
The new Toryism was much more radical than the one-nation approach of
Macmillan and Heath. The heady rhetoric in the early 1980s was that if the
middle classes were given the opportunity and the incentives, they would
deliver. The whole country would benefit. But amid the longest recession
since the 1930s the question must inevitably be asked, have the middle
classes reneged on that promise? Comparatively few voters last Thursday
apparently thought that Labour's strategies would prove any more effective,
but the radical Tory approach has proved disappointing, too. Delicately,
John Major may want to edge his economic policies towards the centre ground.
For a brief few years, it is true, the British economy boomed. In the five
years between 1985 and 1989 economic growth averaged 3.7 per cent a year.
But it was quite unsustainable and we are paying for it now. Although loudly
celebrated at the time, the Thatcher 'miracle' now appears largely to have
been an illusion.
You can make numbers tell most tales if you try, but over the 12 years of
Conservative rule up to 1991, economic growth averaged just 1.7 per cent a
year. This was marginally better than the 1.4 per cent a year achieved
during the previous six years of Labour government. Margaret Thatcher
notably failed, however, to restore on any consistent basis the more dynamic
growth rates recorded up to 1973.
Indeed, the early 1970s appear to have been the watershed. In the 30 years
up to 1973, growth averaged 3.1 per cent, but in the 18 years since then the
pace of expansion has been only half as rapid. There can, of course, be many
explanations for these secular changes, including the strength of the world
economy at large and, at home, changes in population size and structure. In
the 1960s the British population was rising at 0.6 per cent a year, in the
1980s at only 0.2 per cent. Other countries, such as Germany, also suffered
an economic deceleration in the 1980s. The slowdown may not have been any
fault of the politicians. Yet they claim the credit for good times and will
inevitably get the blame for the bad.
Nevertheless, to give the middle classes their head can have tremendously
positive effects. In the 1980s, for instance, managers were given back the
right to manage, and the efficiency of much of British private enterprise
greatly improved. A new wave of entrepreneurs sprang up, and changed the
face of much of the the corporate sector.
But the middle classes can also be snobbish and money-grabbing. They are
drawn towards pleasant service industries rather than to manufacturing
industry, and to the south of England rather than the north. Home ownership
is a middle class ideal symbolising independence and wealth, but in the
context of financial deregulation it can - and did - turn into an excuse for
rampant speculation.
High rewards for those who achieve great commercial success, especially if
they accept high risks, are eminently justifiable. But there must also be a
culture of self-restraint, or uncontrolled greed will take over. We have
seen far too much of this as top company executives have entered into a
dizzy pay spiral in which each pay rise is self-justifying in relation to
the rewards of competitors, in the absence of any independent concept of
fair or appropriate reward.
In the late 1970s the top 20 per cent of households received 43 per cent of
gross income and 37 per cent of post-tax income. By 1988 these households -
essentially, the middle classes  - were enjoying a 50 per cent share of
gross income, and 44 per cent after tax. During the 1980s the ratio of the
pre-tax earnings of the top 10 per cent of employees to those of the bottom
10 per cent rose from 2.6 to 3.1 times, and pay of the chief executive of
the average large UK public company climbed from Pounds 90,000 to Pounds
400,000. These increases in differentials could have been justified by
improved growth, but the evidence for any positive impact is hard to find at
present, although admittedly the bottom of a recession may not be the best
time to look.
Spending, meantime, seemed to grow even faster than incomes. Margaret
Thatcher's home-grown economics based upon living within one's means and
being self-reliant culture of huge borrowing and overconsumption in which
asset price inflation was expected to bail out - and indeed handsomely
reward - every debtor. A government which began by sternly fighting
inflation and declaring strict monetarist principles presided over a
borrowing binge from the mid-1980s onwards. Bank and building society
lending was climbing at about Pounds 14bn a year when the Tories took over
but at the peak in 1989 it was almost Pounds 90bn. House price inflation in
London had reached 20 per cent by 1987, but middle-class greed was allowed
to run unchecked.
By the late 1980s millions of young people seeking a foothold on the housing
ladder were being sucked into a dangerous vortex of speculation which now
leaves many of them technically bankrupt. The Conservatives might have
expected to be more severely punished at the election for this betrayal.
Again, the principle of privatisation, itself a tremendously potent idea for
improving the dynamics of the economy, was somehow twisted by middle-class
greed. As with housing the profit motive was brought into play, this time
with the ostensible motive of turning people into private shareholders. But
the profit should be proportional to the risks. Instead, privatisation
offers too often became the route to a quick and easy gain for those who had
the stake money and knew how to deal in shares.
The neglect of manufacturing industry was another characteristic feature of
the years of Tory rule. Britain has produced huge numbers of accountants and
lawyers, many of them handsomely paid, and the media, financial services and
all sorts of consultancy services are bursting with talents. But the
dominant middle-class ethic has been hostile to manufacturing industry, and
few of the best products of our education system head in that direction:
relative pay levels clearly tell them not to. You can argue that this
explains the loss of half of the former economic growth rate. Failure
adequately to supply domestic demand for manufactured goods has become
painfully obvious in the current recession, when visible trade has remained
substantially in the red despite the weakness of domestic consumption
overall, which has trimmed import demand.
Manufacturing output has grown by only 0.5 per cent a year over the 12 years
since 1979, and hopes for a revival in the 1990s now rest largely upon
imported Japanese expertise in sectors such as motors and electronics. These
hopes may seem rather more fragile now that the Japanese stock market is in
process of collapse and its banking system may follow suit. Some of the
Japanese money may go home.
If excessive taxation is unfair and disruptive, as the Tories have succeeded
in persuading the British electorate, so is an excessively unequal
distribution of rewards. And the natural priorities of the British middle
classes do not necessarily harmonise with the requirements of a modern
economy. A nation of accountants will soon forget the skills needed to build
motor cars. Moreover a nation can only get rich quite slowly, and if large
numbers of individuals are getting rich quickly it is a sign of the
misdirection of resources.
Margaret Thatcher thought it was enough to dangle a bunch of carrots. In
chasing them, the middle classes would naturally head in the right
direction. Neil Kinnock wanted to take back the carrots and wield a heavy
stick. Now John Major will maintain the incentives, but does he also need to
apply the occasional touch of the whip in order to keep his troublesome cart
horses in line? Certainly he will want to keep any recovery in the house
market well under control, or excessive credit growth will lead to problems
for sterling within the European Monetary System. The government will look
to improvements in standards of corporate governance to keep a lid on pay
awards to top executives. But there are few real signs that the Major regime
has yet moved far in the direction of developing an industrial policy that
might get the battered and distorted British economy back into a more
balanced shape.
In the end the middle classes are paid by results. Their greatly enhanced
perks and differentials have scarcely been justified by the economic
achievements of the past decade or so. Yet this does not mean that the
middle classes cannot produce the goods, just that they need better
leadership. Perhaps a re-elected Conservative government without the
distractions of an early poll to worry about will be able to supply it.

FT  13 APR 92 / Arts: Ciesinski Sisters - Purcell Room
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW CLEMENTS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The sisters Ciesinski have both been heard in London in the opera house  -
soprano Kristine far more often than mezzo Katherine - but their recital on
Thursday with the pianist Iain Burnside was their first appearance here
together. The programme of duets and solo songs was a nicely thematic one:
built around the title of 'All in the Family", it allowed them to range from
an exploration of filial associations in the German Lied, through songs by
sisters (Nadia and Lili Boulanger, Maria Malibran and Pauline Viardot) and
other halves (Fanny Mendelssohn, Clara Schumann, Alma Mahler), to a final
dose of glutinous American sentimentality from Dominick Argento and Lee
Hoiby.
It was a thoughtful compilation, full of intriguing curios. Malibran's songs
may be pure corn and Viardot's arrangements of Chopin disarmingly tasteless,
but at least one of Clara Schumann's Op. 12 settings, written in 1840, her
husband's 'year of song", would stand comparison with many of Robert's
lesser offerings. Alma Mahler's foray into Bergian expressionism in her
version of Dehmel's 'Ansturm' was partial confirmation of the theory that
she suppressed her own creative gifts in deference to her husband's fragile
ego, while Lili Boulanger's beguiling distillation of Debussy and Duparc
made one eager to hear all of the 1919 cycle Clarieres dans le ciel.
No one who has seen any of Kristine Ciesinski's roles at the Coliseum or
Katherine's fearsome Cassandra in the Scottish Opera Trojans could doubt
their dramatic gifts. Scaling those down to the intimacy of a Purcell Room
recital is another matter. Katherine's fierce intensity in Mahler's 'Das
irdische Leben' from Das Knaben Wunderhorn was thoroughly appropriate, so
too was their larger-than-life duetting in Brahms's 'Guter Rat'. But often
the proportions were wrong, the acting too intrusive , and the final effect
well over the top. In the straightforward Lieder Kristine seemed hesitant
and to be struggling to sustain her phrases.
The Ciesinskis communicate a vitality and enjoyment in their singing which
is infectious; they put on a fine show, though one that needs plenty of
space around it.

The BBC's public access series Open Space returns with a programme which to
some may sound self-serving: a defence of the BBC licence fee by an
organisation called Voice Of The Listener (7.40). However, VOL and its
moving spirit, Jocelyn Hay, are certainly not creatures of the corporation.
Indeed they are, when they feel the urge, highly critical of the BBC,
arguing, as in this programme, that it should be far more accountable to
licence payers.
Seeing how the Los Angeles police behave when they know that cameras from
World In Action are with them (8.30) you wonder how much worse they could
possibly be when unobserved. Fortunately (for the public) a secretly shot
video, now famous, shows only too clearly: a crowd of LAPD officers dragged
a black man from his car and beat him senseless with clubs.
C4 celebrates the 250th anniversary of the first performance of Handel's
Messiah with a live broadcast from Dublin where it had its premiere (8.30).
BBC2 repeats the excellent spy parody Sleepers, in two 90-minute episodes,
with Nigel Havers and Warren Clarke playing KGB moles in Britain (9.00).

FT  13 APR 92 / Arts: Little Tramp
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Haymarket Theatre in Basingstoke is about to close for a refurbishment.
Wanting to go out on a high note this agreeable venue's resident company,
the Horseshoe, is presenting the 'world premiere' of a musical about Charlie
Chaplin. Little Tramp was written - music, lyrics and co-libretto - David
Pomeranz, an American, and has been waiting some time for a public exposure.
I'm afraid the whole brave, ambitious, project is an exercise in
self-delusion.
Director Adrian Reynolds was bowled over by a tape of the music for the show
offered to him by an accountant, Colin Essex, whose company is sponsoring
the production. Peter Duncan, still best known as a Blue Peter presenter,
accepted the starring role. One fears that fantasies of a West End, nay
Broadway, transfer are as whimsical as Chaplin's Tramp.
There is one worthwhile moment - when Duncan invents the Little Tramp
character for the first time. He looks convincing. But then the performance
falls apart.
There is no attempt to re-create any of Chaplin's routines, to try to convey
his genius.
Instead there are banal lyrics, featureless songs, and unappealing acting.
Every character is a caricature - all policemen brutal, all journalists
venal, the rich all snobs, Chaplin's wives (apart from Oona) all gold
diggers. The production is subsumed in sentimentality as Chaplin's life is
tediously surveyed from honest London poverty to belated Hollywood honours
and his prickly personality sanitised.
In Alan Ayckbourn's plays misguided musicals are presented as a load of
laughs. There is not a smile to be raised from Little Tramp which stretches
three hours into a fair resemblance of Chaplin's near 90 years.

Corporation, as non-executive chairman of its London operation.
Hardy, who stands some six feet eight inches tall, is an old City hand who
has seen the game from a number of perspectives. Finance director of Tate &amp;
Lyle in the mid 1970s, he is more recently remembered for the bruising,
ultimately unsuccessful, fight he put up on behalf of Globe Investment Trust
against the British Coal Pension Funds. He was chairman of Globe when BCPF
swallowed what was then Britain's largest investment trust in 1990. He is
currently also on the board of a number of other companies, including
Hanson.
While the role of LDCC has been at best controversial, he claims to have
'created jobs at a very competitive cost. I'm still convinced Docklands is
the place of the future,' adds the 61-year-old Hardy - admitting to being
'shattered' by the turmoil into which Canadian developer Olympia &amp; York is
now plunged.
While Bankers Trust manages Pounds 75bn of funds worldwide, London accounts
for a small proportion of that whole, with BTIM Ltd specialising in active
management of European equities as well as structured quantitative
techniques. BT claims to be among the top five index managers in the UK, but
Hardy, with his extensive contacts, has been taken aboard to raise the
profile of the European business further. His contribution will be in
'developing the European corporate and marketing strategy'.
Previously, BTIM Ltd was chaired by Kent Atkins, the New York-based boss of
the worldwide investment management group.

FT  13 APR 92 / People: Plum job at O&amp;M
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The top of the advertising tree is still largely dominated by men, but the
Texan-born Charlotte Beers, 56, has bucked that trend by taking one of the
industry's plum jobs as chairman of Ogilvy &amp; Mather Worldwide, part of the
WPP marketing services group.
Beers - a graduate in maths and physics  - has one of the most impressive
track records in US advertising. In 1987 she became the first - and as yet
only  - woman to chair the American Association of Advertising Agencies.
Before joining O&amp;M she spent ten years as chief executive of Chicago-based
Tatham, part of the Paris-based Euro RSCG group, the world's sixth largest
advertising group. In her stint there Tatham quad-rupled its billings.
Beers takes over from Graham Phillips, 53, who after 27 years with O&amp;M is to
take a rather more back seat as vice chairman. Martin Sorrell, WPP's chief
executive, stresses the smoothness of the transition - Phillips himself
sought out Beers to head up the agency, which has billings of some Dollars
5.4bn annually.
Beers says she is 'elated to be working rather than be the subject of so
much press speculation' as to which agency she would be joining. She picked
out O&amp;M because 'I've always had an image of O&amp;M as the best brand of
agency. Another attractive aspect is that there has been such a natural
transition, with Graham still being there in support.'

Results due
THE outlook for UK construction stocks should become clearer this week with
several major companies announcing final results for last year.
Recession in the housing and construction sectors are expected to take a
heavy toll, with provisions for property write-downs, losses and cut
dividends expected. But the market will also be looking for signs of
optimism, and will take its first early pointers on the outlook for UK
residential property especially.
John Mowlem, the construction group which also owns 90 per cent of London
City Airport, is expected to announce today pre-tax profits of Pounds 10m,
down by more than two-thirds. The company's scaffolding subsidiary had a
poor first half and a dividend cut is expected.
Taylor Woodrow, which has suffered badly from both the property and
construction recessions, is expected to do tomorrow no better than break
even (against Pounds 83.4m pre-tax profits a year earlier). Heavy
provisions, and possible write downs on its property portfolio, are
expected, although the dividend is probably safe.
RMC, the world's biggest cement maker which reports on the same day, is
unlikely to surprise tomorrow with pre-tax profits down one quarter to
Pounds 160m. Strong performance in Germany is likely to buffer the company
from a weak UK.
Tarmac, the UK's largest housebuilder, looks likely to cut its dividend when
it reports a plunge in profits on Wednesday to around Pounds 35m (Pounds
190.7m). The company is expected to make a Pounds 12m provision on the
Channel Tunnel, and a possible land write down.
Blue Circle Industries, the building materials group, announcing the same
day, is expected to be in much better shape and to limit profits fall to
Pounds 126m (Pounds 195m). The dividend should be maintained. Although the
UK's performance will be poor, there are hopes for signs of an upturn in the
US.
Smiths Industries, the aerospace and medical equipment maker, is expected to
turn in on Wednesday interim pre-tax profits of around Pounds 45m (Pounds
50.7m) and an unchanged interim dividend of 3.9p.
Investors will be keen to hear whether Smiths is closer to sewing up a
partnership agreement with Collins Avionics, a division of Rockwell
International of the US. Such a pairing would create a third force capable
of offering a full range of commercial aircraft avionics. The other two are
Honeywell of the US and Sextant of France.
The UK's struggling hotels will take the limelight on Wednesday when both
Forte and the Savoy Group report full-year results. Forte is expected to
announce pre-tax profits sharply down from 1990's Pounds 190m, with
estimates ranging from Pounds 73m to Pounds 78m. The Savoy could drop from
last year's Pounds 10.3m to Pounds 2m. This year should be much better,
particularly with the prospect of an upturn in business travel after the
decisive UK election.

FT  13 APR 92 / Economics: Focus on UK jobless total
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ATTENTION in the UK will focus on whether recent faint signs of economic
recovery will be reflected in the latest unemployment figures, to be
published on Thursday.
In the US, analysts will study a raft of economic data for clues as to the
hesitant revival, while the markets wait anxiously to see how far the latest
figures for industrial production in Japan indicate the economy is slowing
down.
Economists think the UK will announce a March rise in joblessness of about
40,000, similar to February's figure. The government is also expected to
announce a high public sector borrowing requirement in March of about Pounds
6.2bn, bringing the PSBR for the 1991-92 financial year to nearly Pounds
14bn.
Unemployment below 40,000 might indicate stronger signs of an economic
recovery than have been apparent over the past few weeks. Some economists
believe the continuation of Conservative economic policies after last week's
election result will reduce consumer and industrial uncertainties and lead
to a surge in spending in the next few months, a development which could
lead to more favourable growth prospects.
Highlights of the week ahead, with projections in brackets provided by
financial information company MMS International, are as follows:
Today: Switzerland, monthly meeting of central bank govenors at Bank of
International Settlements. Japan, February trade surplus (Dollars 10.8bn).
New Zealand, March food price index.
Tomorrow: US, March retail sales (down 0.4 per cent), car sales in week
April 1-10. UK, March producer prices index (raw materials index up 0.4 per
cent on month, 4.9 per cent year-on-year; factory-gate prices up 0.5 per
cent on month, 4.2 per cent year-on-year), February manufacturing output
(down 0.1 per cent on month, down 2.7 per cent year-on-year), February
industrial production (down 0.2 per cent on month). France, March consumer
prices index (up 0.2 per cent on month, 3.1 per cent on year). Japan,
February machinery orders. New Zealand, 4th quarter gross domestic product.
Canada, February inventories to shipments ratio (1.55), February unfilled
orders (down 0.4 per cent on month).
Wednesday: US, March industrial production (up 0.3 per cent), capacity
utilisation (78.2 per cent), February business inventories (down 0.1 per
cent). Sweden, March trade surplus (SKr5.2bn); Japan, February industrial
production.
Thursday: Germany, Bundesbank council meeting (no change in interest rates
expected). US, February merchandise exports (Dollars 36bn), imports (Dollars
41.5bn), trade deficit (Dollars 5.5bn), money supply figures for March and
week ending April 6, initial claims for week ending April 4. UK,
Confederation of British Industry distributive trades survey for March,
March public sector borrowing requirement (Pounds 6.2bn), March unemployment
(up 40,000), average earnings in year to February (up 7 per cent), February
unit labour costs (4.5 per cent year-on-year). Canada, March consumer prices
index (up 0.3 per cent on month, 1.5 per cent on year).
Friday: US, March housing starts (1.25m), building permits. Markets closed
in many countries.
During the week: Germany, March producer prices index (0.3 per cent up on
month, 2.5 per cent on year); Denmark, March consumer prices index (O2 per
cent up on month, 2.4 per cent on year); Norway, March trade balance; Japan,
March money supply data; Spain, March consumer prices index; Italy, February
industrial production.

FT  13 APR 92 / Management: Revolution behind closed doors - US boards have
been described by a critic as '10 friends of management, a woman and a
black'. But Martin Dickson says that bosses now have something to fear from
non-executive directors.
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
A remarkable display of muscle-flexing by non-executive directors of General
Motors is sending shock waves across corporate America and may lead to a big
shift in the balance of power in US board rooms.
The potential winners: shareholders and non-executive directors. The losers:
entrenched management.
On Monday of last week the GM board's non-executive members, tired of the
company's heavy losses and impatient at its pace of change, took matters
into their own hands.
Led by John Smale, a former chairman of Procter &amp; Gamble, the consumer
products group, the directors demoted two of the company's top managers,
including the right hand man of Robert Stempel, the chairman.
They also changed the functions of the board's executive committee - which
theoretically wielded power between board meetings but in practice never met
 -to make it a more active body to offer advice to Stempel. And at its head
they installed Smale.
The upshot is that while Stempel is still running the company on a daily
basis, he has a powerful group of directors breathing down his neck - and
one which is plugged in to a more comprehensive flow of information about
the business.
This, coupled with the demotion of his lieutenant, Lloyd Reuss, GM's
55-year-old president, sends a simple but powerful message: perform, or
else. Reuss was replaced by Jack Smith, head of GM's international
operations, who has also been appointed chief operating officer.
America's non-executive directors have a well deserved reputation as 'rubber
stamps', passively accepting the decisions of day-to-day management. Yet
over the past few years an increasing number have been trying to shed this
image.
Directors of motor manufacturer, Chrysler, recently resisted efforts by Lee
Iacocca to stay on as chairman after his retirement date. And last autumn
the board of Compaq Computer dismissed Rod Canion, chief executive and
co-founder of the business, in a clash over poor results and management
style.
But such behaviour at a company like General Motors, the largest industrial
business in the US, is nothing short of revolutionary. For decades, the
company has been a by-word for insularity and bureaucratic complacency.
So the GM directors have created a powerful example which other companies
may now follow. 'This is a landmark development for the US,' says Howard
Sherman of Institutional Shareholder Services, a Washington-based group
which advises large US investors on corporate affairs. 'An act like this
will really galvanise a lot of boards.'
In the US, as in the UK, non-executive directors are meant to act on behalf
of shareholders as a supportive check on the managers hired to run the
business. But too often, say critics, they are merely 'the parsley on the
fish'.
It is impossible to quantify just how influential non-executives have become
because much of the action takes place behind closed doors. Dressing-downs
as public as that delivered at GM remain rare.
Still, ISS's Sherman says his extensive discussions with outside directors
makes clear that 'they see their jobs very differently from just two years
ago'.
An important factor is the increasing importance in the US of institutional
investors demanding better 'corporate governance' - insisting that managers
should be more responsive to shareholders.
The corporate governance movement was given a fillip by the 1980s takeover
wave. On the one hand, this encouraged managers to introduce anti-takeover
'poison pills' which protected their positions, but did not necessarily best
serve shareholders. On the other, it made investors realise that it could be
cheaper, and more effective, to simply change the management of a poorly
performing company than go through the loops of a bid battle.
In its early stages the corporate governance movement concentrated on
correcting specific abuses by management, such as 'poison pills'. But over
the last two years, it has begun to say that a much more comprehensive
change in the way boards are constituted and run is needed. Fix the board,
runs the argument, and most other problems will fix themselves.
But that is a great deal easier said than done. The first problem is the
nature of the individuals chosen to serve as non-executives. A company's
outside directors will typically consist of senior managers from other
businesses, often friends of the chief executive, together with a sprinkling
of retired politicians, celebrities and worthies.
Graef Crystal, one of America's best-known critics of management pay-scales,
has described boards as '10 friends of management, a woman and a black'.
'Directors are picked because the chief executive knows them and knows they
are likely to be on his side,' says Robert Monks, a leader of the corporate
governance movement, who highlighted the issue last year when he
independently fought an unsuccessful campaign to get a board seat at Sears,
Roebuck, the ailing stores group.
In theory, investors have the ultimate say over the choice of directors,
since a shareholder vote is necessary for them to be elected to the board.
Until recently, investors tended simply to nod through management's nominees
but there are now signs of growing dissatisfaction with this process.
For example, some corporate governance activists have been trying to set up
a data base of potential outside directors. Investors also played a big role
in selecting nominees for the board of Lockheed, the aerospace group, when
it found itself under threat from a corporate raider a year ago.
But even if some independent spirits do make it on to a board, they are
likely to find it hard to take effective action.
Most large American companies have a majority of non-executive directors on
their board but most also combine the positions of chairman and chief
executive. This gives a company's top manager immense powers to set the
agenda of the board which is meant to be monitoring his performance.
Here too there are signs of incipient shareholder revolt. At Sears, Roebuck,
shareholders have put down resolutions for next month's annual meeting
calling for the roles of chairman and CEO to be split.
Institutions are also trying to limit the power of chief executives by
ensuring that board sub-committees, where much of directors' most important
work is done, are controlled by outside directors.
For example, the California Public Employees' Retirement System (Calpers),
the largest US public pension fund, and United Shareholders Association,
another corporate governance group, recently pressured Ryder System, a large
truck leasing business, into changing its corporate by-laws to ensure than a
majority of directors, and all members of its pay and nominating committees,
are non-executives.
Yet even if such reforms are carried out, non-executives can remain
ineffective if they lack information. A powerful chief executive can keep a
great deal from his board, whose non-executive members are busy people with
limited time to spend digging around the business.
The GM board's action in this area is particularly intriguing. First, Smale
appears to have spent many hours inside the company conducting a survey on
senior executives' performance before launching last week's bombshell.
Second, his assumption of the executive committee chairmanship means that
non-executives should be better placed to receive quick intelligence of what
is going on.
Ross Perot, the combative Texan billionaire who was ousted from the GM board
in 1986 after criticising management, used to describe his fellow directors
there as 'pet rocks'. Last week the rocks stirred, and the result could be a
small earthquake in many board rooms.

FT  13 APR 92 / Management: How to keep up with the corporate Joneses - Why
companies are turning to benchmarking to measure their performance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
How does a company measure and improve its own performance? One way is by
'benchmarking' its competitors.
Benchmarking is becoming increasingly popular, even though some companies
are uncertain about how to do it, and others worried that it is somehow
unethical.
For the uninitiated, benchmarking involves comparing the performance of a
company to that of other companies. It is an alternative to the more usual
internal yardsticks of performance.
Despite the undertones of industrial espionage, benchmarking is completely
above board. There are two main ways of doing it, one which focuses on
customers, the other on processes.
Competitor benchmarking covers the performance and relative strengths of
direct competitors. The sources for the information include customer and
supplier interviews and published data from research reports, conference
reports, trade bodies and press comment.
By contrast, process benchmarking is not restricted to direct competition so
data may be easier to obtain. Information is exchanged between companies
with similar administrative and manufacturing processes - often through an
intermediary to preserve confidentiality.
This provides all the participants with useful benchmarks without
compromising competitive positions. British Steel's change from being a
nationalised loss-maker into a lean, low-cost producer is one success
claimed by benchmarking's fans.
British Steel began using benchmarking in 1988 before privatisation at a
macro level to compare performance against other companies, and at a micro
level to undertake detailed measurements against other steel plants.
Today, the company benchmarks costs, customer service, quality, reliability
and responsiveness. Teams of technical and operational managers identify
processes and plants and then measure them against comparable plants and the
'best in the world'. An action plan is then drawn up, perhaps linked to a
capital expenditure plan.
In the service sector, British Airways used benchmarking since 1987 to help
transform itself from a stodgy, state-controlled enterprise to a leading
world airline.
Project teams of senior and front line staff from various departments
analyse business processes and identify the weakest elements. They then
visit direct competitors and other relevant organisations with checklists
and questions.
British Airways has found that competitors are often willing to share
information in the pursuit of answers to jointly perceived problems.
Once the project teams have collected their information, they make
recommendations to senior management.
The proposals are made by the people who will have to live with them, which
British Airways says is an important factor in making benchmarking work.
The success of these benchmarking exercises depends on focusing improvement
in key areas, and setting targets which are challenging, but achievable. A T
Kearney,the international management consultants, have used benchmarking in
their client work for 10 years.
Companies increasingly recognise that motivating staff to improve current
processes and setting tough but achievable targets requires identifying and
quantifying 'best practice', says Steve Young, A T Kearney vice president.
'The problem is that terms like 'best practice' and 'world class' are widely
used and abused. Benchmarking gives a common framework by providing hard
data. We find it makes organisations sit up and appreciate - often for the
first time  - the degree of change required.'

FT  13 APR 92 / Creation of Edinburgh as 'second capital' urged
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
EDINBURGH should become Britain's second capital and government departments
should be moved to Scotland, according to the Institute of Economic Affairs,
the rightwing think tank.
Professor Christie Davies, Professor of Sociology at Reading University,
says the creation of a second capital would create jobs and aid development
in Scotland and halt moves towards political independence.
Making Edinburgh a second capital would 'siphon off some of the excessive
development of the south-east and channel it to Scotland,' he says in an
article in Economic Affairs, the institute journal.
'An all-British presence in Scotland would provide Scotland with far more
jobs and a far greater sense of national importance than a regional assembly
or a Caledonian government ever could.'
Prof Davies warns that if Scotland became independent it would fall 'into
the kind of hopeless poverty that afflicts all the small countries on the
fringe of the European Community'.

FT  13 APR 92 / Election 1992: EC presents foreign policy challenge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MARSH, European Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN Major's greatest foreign policy challenge during the next five years
will be to turn relations with the European Community into a source of
opportunity, rather than a threat to British interests.
By returning to power with a solid mandate at a time when governments in the
other three main EC countries - Germany, France and Italy  - are looking
shaky, Mr Major has been dealt a strong hand.
The move towards a 'federal' Europe - attacked by Mr Major during his
election campaign - has been dealt a severe blow during recent weeks, as
some of the compromises agreed at last December's Maastricht summit have
started to come unstuck.
Senior British ministers believe that the Maastricht timetable towards
monetary union has been slowed by Germany's post-unity difficulties. German
officials are now talking of the possibility that Germany may fail to meet
the economic performance targets laid down as criteria for movement to a
single European currency in 1996-97.
Mr Major's trump card is likely to be his friendship with Mr Helmut Kohl,
the German chancellor. Although he is not ill-disposed towards Mr Neil
Kinnock, Mr Kohl showed a clear preference for Mr Major remaining in office.
Germany's waning enthusiasm for rapid moves towards European union is likely
to create more room for common ground between London and Bonn. Britain hopes
to stage a summit meeting with the German government in June, shortly before
the UK takes over the presidency of the EC.
The prime minister expects to devote considerable attention during the
British presidency to the question of widening the Community. Sweden, in
particular, is looking to Britain for a lead to advance its hopes for EC
membership.
Mr Major is also expected to arrange soon a meeting with Mr Pierre
Beregovoy, the new French prime minister. The two already know each other
from their previous meetings as finance ministers. Mr Major respects Mr
Beregovoy's pragmatism, and has noted with satisfaction his introduction of
tax cuts to try to get the French economy moving.
While the Franco-German relationship remains the key bilateral partnership
in the EC, links between Paris and Bonn have been affected by
disillusionment since German reunification. British officials believe that
Mr Major may be in a strong position to vie for Chancellor Kohl's favours -
and possibly push his relationship with President Francois Mitterrand into
second place.
A crucial test will come during attempts to solve the impasse in the
negotiations on the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt) during the
next few weeks. Mr Major will use his influence with Chancellor Kohl to try
to work for a free-trade breakthrough. Here, Mr Kohl would risk alienating
France, which has opposed central elements of the proposed Gatt measures to
liberalise agriculture.
Defence is another area in which Britain will need to show imagination in
European policies. Hopes of genuine trilateral co-operation between Britain,
France and Germany in working out a new European security partnership have
so far foundered on the three countries' differing perceptions of their
national interests.
However, British officials are optimistic that Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the new
defence secretary, will strike up a constructive relationship with Mr Volker
Ruhe, the new German defence minister.
One British official yesterday described the Rifkind-Ruhe tandem as 'made in
heaven'. The simultaneous arrival of two younger generation defence
ministers offered a golden opportunity to break the European defence
impasse, he said.

FT  13 APR 92 / Election 1992: Union leaders will look to Brussels for
muscle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UNION leaders surveyed Labour's election defeat and concluded that the fight
for influence will have to continue through the European Community. 'We will
have to fight London from Brussels,' said Mr John Edmonds, leader of the GMB
general union.
Leaders such as Mr Edmonds believe that British employment law will be
increasingly influenced by EC regulations, in spite of the government's
'opt-out' from an extension of EC employment legislation.
Others, including Mr Bill Morris, head of the more leftwing TGWU general
union, said another attempt must be made to offer a 'consensus agenda' to
employers and the government. He said: 'The government must at least be
given a chance to show if it is interested in consensus.'
The acid test will be whether the government proceeds with plans to further
restrict union action and finances. Some union leaders believe the planned
legislation was a gambit to sustain the union bogey in the election
campaign, and will now be dropped.
The government proposals include ending the automatic 'check off' of dues. .
This could exacerbate the financial crisis facing many unions.
Financial pressure could lead to a review of the role of the Trades Union
Congress. Union mergers are creating 'super-unions', which believe they can
do most of the things that the TUC does and resent paying large affiliation
fees to it. The TUC's role may be reduced to European lobbying, health and
safety, and campaigning on a few themes such as women's equality.
Mergers will continue, and the Tory victory is likely to speed up the
much-rumoured one between the TGWU and the GMB general unions.
The unions will continue to play an important part in the Labour party,
providing much of its financial backing. But if it appears that Labour can
never win an election, the trend towards a loosening of the ties will gather
pace.

FT  13 APR 92 / Election 1992: Welfare lobbyists wary of Lilley
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR PETER Lilley's appointment as social security secretary puts a
right-winger in charge of Whitehall's biggest spending department - a
prospect likely to worry groups lobbying on behalf of welfare recipients and
the low paid.
Mr Lilley was not a political heavyweight in his past incarnation as trade
and industry secretary, but he had a reputation for ideological purity and
for defending the values of the Thatcherite No Turning Back group.
Looking younger than his 48 years, his experience as a junior Treasury
minister only convinced him of the necessity of controlling state
intervention and spending.
At the social security department he will have to reconcile gut convictions
with the political pitfalls of a high spending department. If he fails to
lobby hard for extra spending in what are always difficult negotiations with
the Treasury, he could quickly find himself resented by Conservatives as
well as by the opposition.
As his predecessor Mr Tony Newton found, the department usually only brings
a high profile when events are against you. And Mr Lilley's omens are not
good. At the DTI he was more concerned that his decisions should be
ideologically correct, rather than politically convenient. He was sometimes
indecisive and failed to strike a rapport with either Tory backbenchers or
industrialists.
As a Commons performer he lacks panache. At party conferences he is happier
with self-deprecating jokes rather than manufacturing the self-esteem and
confidence more usual of cabinet ministers. Protecting Mr Lilley will be the
prime minister's personal commitment to the social security system and the
explicit commitment in the Conservative manifesto to keep child benefit as
'the cornerstone' of Tory policy for families with children and to increase
the benefit in line with inflation.
A more immediate challenge for Mr Lilley will be to respond to the pressure
for reform of pension legislation in the wake of the late Mr Robert Maxwell
raiding pension funds of companies he controlled.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FOREIGN ministers of the Organisation of American States (OAS) meeting in
Washington today will discuss the possible imposition of sanctions against
Peru's seven-day-old dictatorship.
Mr Augusto Blacker Miller, Peru's foreign minister, will have a tough task
persuading the OAS that President Alberto Fujimori's suspension of Congress
and the Supreme Court are 'transitional' measures.
He is likely to argue that the old democracy was flawed and that time is
needed to correct Peru's 'corrupt' institutions. He will also seek to
legitimise Mr Fujimori's military-backed coup with opinion polls showing
overwhelming support for the new regime.
The disbanded Congress, which met in secret last Thursday to impeach Mr
Fujimori, will be sending its own envoy to the OAS. Mr Maximo San Roman,
Peru's vice-president who was in Miami at the time of the coup, will ask the
OAS not to recognise the de facto government.
The OAS is believed to be reluctant to impose economic sanctions against
Peru, although US President George Bush has not ruled out this option.
Diplomats in Lima said the OAS would probably send a peace mission to Peru
in an attempt to broker an early return to democracy.
In an attempt to mollify international opinion, Mr Fujimori has restored
press freedom and released most politicians who were under house arrest at
the weekend. The president has also decreed tough penalties for drug
trafficking and money laundering and has ordered the air force to bomb
landing strips in the Huallaga Valley - the centre of Peru's cocaine
traffic. The last two orders appeared designed to soften US condemnation of
the new government.
Peru faces deep international isolation; the US has suspended some Dollars
320m (Pounds 186m) of economic and military aid, Germany has frozen Dollars
110m in development aid, Spain about Dollars 50m, and Colombia has broken
off integration talks.
At present Peru has about Dollars 1.5bn in foreign reserves. This is enough
to tide the new government over until international outrage subsides.
Mr Fujimori is gambling the US will eventually resume business with him,
given that the fight against drug trafficking remains Washington's main
policy goal in the region.

THE state-owned Korea Development Bank (KDB) is refusing industrial loans to
the Hyundai group, the second largest business group in South Korea, because
of a dispute between the conglomerate and the government.
Hyundai has complained that while the KDB granted Won250bn (Pounds 190m) in
loans to the group last year for the expansion or improvement of plant
facilities, the bank has not acted on its request for Won300bn in loans this
year.
KDB said it was refusing to make loans to Hyundai because its
creditworthiness could deteriorate due to its conflict with the government.
The government has imposed a series of financial restrictions on Hyundai
following the recent success in the National Assembly election of the
political party established by the founder of Hyundai, Mr Chung Ju-yung.
However, the government made conciliatory moves over the weekend in an
apparent effort to defuse the situation.
Mr Chung Se-yung, Hyundai chairman, met Mr Lee Jin-seol, senior presidential
secretary for economic affairs, to discuss the impact the feud would have on
the economy.
The Office of Bank Supervision (OBS) also postponed a decision to deprive
Hyundai Electronics Industries (HEI) of its preferential rights to bank
loans.

JAPAN'S ruling Liberal Democratic party (LDP) was shaken yesterday by the
murder of Mr Shinjiro Yamamura, the parliamentary budget committee chairman
who had also played an important role in improving links between Japan and
North Korea.
Mr Yamamura, 58, died at his home early yesterday after being stabbed in the
neck and chest. Police have detained his 24-year-old daughter; she was
receiving psychiatric treatment last night.
The politician was due to leave for North Korea today as part of an LDP
delegation attending the 80th birthday celebrations of President Kim Il
Sung. LDP members will seek clarity from Pyongyang on allowing international
inspection of its nuclear facilities, to which the country has recently
agreed.
Mr Yamamura's North Korean connection dates back to 1970, when he offered to
fly to Pyongyang in return for the release of passengers aboard an aircraft
hijacked by a Japanese terrorist group.
He was first elected to parliament in 1964 and, in spite of being implicated
in the Lockheed scandal in 1976, was re-elected nine times, having terms as
transport and agriculture minister.
Mr Yamamura was responsible for successfully steering this year's budget
through parliament.
The LDP easily retained a seat in parliament's upper house yesterday in a
by-election in which it faced little opposition, AP adds.
Mrs Yasu Kano was opposed only by the Communist party in the election in
Ibaraki prefecture. The opposition Socialists did not field a candidate.

LORD WILSON, Hong Kong's outgoing governor, has urged Mr John Major, the
British premier, to make an early decision on his successor.
Lord Wilson said at the weekend that he hoped his replacement would be named
within the next few weeks and that the individual chosen would have
knowledge of China and Hong Kong.
Lord Wilson is expected to travel to London by the end of the month for
talks with Mr Major and Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary.
The choice of governor is likely to be one of Mr Major's most difficult
appointments. The next occupant of government house is likely to be the
person who hands back the UK's last big colony to a communist regime. The
job is not seen to be for someone who wants a political career after 1997.
Senior colonial officials are adamant the appointment of a 'failed'
politician would be detrimental to Hong Kong. Persistent reports from London
that Dr David Owen, the former Labour foreign secretary and leader of the
Social Democrats, is a favourite for the post worries officials.
The job is demanding and requires a high degree of administrative skill. The
governor is one of the last true plenipotentiates; he presides over a civil
service of over 100,000 and possesses wide reserve powers.
In addition, since last September's elections in Hong Kong - which returned
18 democratically elected individuals to the 60 member Legislative Council -
politics in the colony has become more fractious and the government has come
under greater pressure to justify and explain its policies.
High on the agenda of a new governor will be how to incorporate some of the
democratically-elected politicians into his cabinet, or Executive Council.
Lord Wilson failed to do this, and it has cost his administration dear.

FT  13 APR 92 / Spanish government struggles to repair damage of inflation
data leaks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER BRUCE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE SPANISH government is trying to repair the damage to its reputation in
international bond and money markets amid evidence that its monthly
inflation data is being leaked days before being officially announced.
Analysts and traders, particularly in London, have been angered by what they
see as the Spanish authorities' lax attitude to the leaking of the figures
and about what some market professionals believe to be market manipulation
by official institutions.
On Friday an unsigned article in a Madrid newspaper close to the finance
ministry suggested some officials at the national statistics institute (INE)
had been sacked for leaking information and that the numbers were once again
'absolutely secret'.
But late last week, the ministry also conceded it was still 'trying to find
out how' the US financial service, Telerate, had delivered the official
inflation figure up to 40 minutes before its main market rival, Reuters, for
the past four months.
Bond dealers in London say remarkably accurate rumours about the Spanish
inflation figure - well wide of market expectations  - circulated in the
City and in Madrid a few days before they were formally announced by the INE
in November, December and January. Dealers were angered further by
inaccurate guidance from both the Bank of Spain and the Treasury last month
that the February inflation figure would be much lower than it was.
Before the February consumer price index announcement (in March), dealers
bought heavily into peseta debt and the market collapsed just before
official publication. The monetary authorities nevertheless had offloaded
large volumes of short term debt. This suits Madrid which is loath to sell
long-term bonds while interest rates are falling.
In January and February, analysts were expecting high CPI increases in the
preceding months and on both occasions rumours began to circulate a few days
before publication which predicted much lower CPI rises with complete
accuracy. While Spain focuses on bringing inflation under control, the
monthly CPI figure is its key economic indicator.
'The December and January data were leaked,' said Ms Jan Samols, a bond
analyst with UBS Phillips &amp; Drew. 'We were getting the leaks four days in
advance.'
Many analysts in London believe the information has filtered on to the
market through an as yet unidentified Madrid broker. Analysts visiting
Madrid have complained informally of the leaks and of inaccurate official
guidance.
'Everyone knows about the leaks,' said the head of the treasury department
at a large UK merchant bank. 'Last month (with the February CPI) you could
have made a lot of money on the bond markets.'
Mr Steven Major, senior bond analyst with Credit Lyonnais Euro-Securities,
said that by February 'things were getting quite bad. People were calling up
from Madrid claiming to know what the inflation figures were. It is highly
unprofessional.' Because some of the accurate leaks have widely contradicted
market expectations, they have embarrassed bond analysts, who advise
dealers.
The inflation figure does not seem to have been leaked a few days ahead of
the March CPI figure, due to be released by the INE this morning, but the
market is taking few chances and has remained flat ahead of the
announcement.
None the less, it will still be alert to a last-minute leak. Since November,
Telerate has beaten Reuters to the figure. Telerate is serviced by one of
Spain's most experienced financial journalists, Mr Primo Gonzalez. He has
beaten Reuters by up to 40 minutes through what he describes as superior
journalistic footwork.
While the finance ministry says it is trying to establish how Mr Gonzalez
does this, an official noted that 'last time it was only 10 minutes ahead'.
"We can move billions of pesetas in a one minute phone call,' remarks one
bond dealer in London. 'The Spanish authorities do not appreciate what is
happening here.' The INE said Reuters is being beaten because at the moment
the CPI figure is telexed to news agencies, its Madrid telex may be
occupied.
Telerate though, has been publishing the figure before the INE releases it.
Ms Samols says she called the INE to ask for a breakdown of the CPI after
she saw it come up on Telerate two months ago. She was told this was
impossible because it had not yet been published.
Mr Major remembers the market being heavily bid up the morning the February
CPI figure was being published. 'Suddenly the currency started to come off
sharply and bond yields started to go up,' he says. There was still nothing
on his Reuters screen and the INE had still not made its announcement.

A TREATY creating a 19-country European Economic Area is likely to be signed
next month after the European Court of Justice cleared it at the weekend.
The EEA accord, negotiated between the European Community and the European
Free Trade Association, was thrown into doubt by an objection from the Court
of Justice two months after its conclusion in October. The court said a
proposed joint EEA panel of judges would undermine its own autonomy as the
Community's supreme court.
EC-Efta negotiators agreed to resolve disputes over the judicial
interpretation of EEA laws through a joint political committee, rather than
a fully-fledged court.
On Saturday the Community Court said it had no objection to this, but said
the committee's decisions 'must not be contrary' to its own rulings. This
may have to be added to the treaty as a protocol, Efta diplomats said
yesterday.
The EEA agreement means the EC is, in effect, extending single market
freedoms to 40m Scandinavians, Austrians and Swiss. It will increase trade
between the two groups, which are already each other's largest commercial
partners, leading eventually to a free flow of goods, capital, services and
labour between the groups.
The Efta countries will be able to shape, but not take, EC decisions. They
will be consulted at an early stage by the European Commission on
forthcoming legislation but they will not have a vote in the Council of
Ministers.
However, the agreement has stirred institutional jealousy precisely because
it gives Efta countries a kind of half-membership of the Community. After
the EC judges, the next group that needs placating are MEPs, who have passed
a resolution saying they 'will not approve an agreement which would weaken
community institutions, and notably the European Parliament, in their
legislative functions'.
The agreement is due to come into effect on January 1 1993, although its
practical effect may be shortlived as three of the six Efta countries -
Austria, Sweden and Finland - have already applied for full EC membership.

THE RAIN stayed away yesterday as Euro Disneyland, Europe's biggest leisure
park, opened for business amid a barrage of publicity, including a Dollars
10m television Europe-wide advertising campaign capped by a two-hour live
broadcast to 30 countries on Saturday night.
The trains which should have carried opening day guests stayed away too,
halted by striking railway employees who claim that the extension of the
suburban line to the park, 20 miles east of Paris, has created staffing and
security problems.
Also absent was a speech of welcome from France's socialist government. Mr
Michael Eisner, Disney's chairman, declared the park open, on a cool and
hazy day, from a platform halfway up Sleeping Beauty's castle, and is seen
(above) escorting a 8-year-old Gorka Gallier, first visitor to the park.
Despite the virulent opposition of some French intellectuals and the
apparent reticence of the government, Disney's executives were warm in their
appreciation of their host country's efforts.
Mr Roy Disney, founder Walt's nephew, described the park as an emotional
homecoming for the family. The Disneys, he said, were French until the
Norman invasion brought them to England. The family's name was once
d'Isigny, after the town of Isigny-sur-Mer in Normandy.
The company is hoping for 11m customers this year, but queues at the
entrance three hours after opening were no more than four or five deep.
As to the park itself, France's anxious intellectuals can probably relax.
The idea of Euro Disney as a threat to French civilisation seems a bit
overdone when confronted with the reality of a spin on a fairground
attraction called Dumbo the Flying Elephant.

FT  13 APR 92 / Bosnian leaders agree on ceasefire
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   BELGRADE
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
LEADERS of Bosnia-Hercegovina yesterday agreed to a ceasefire from midnight
last night among the warring ethnic groups in the former Yugoslav republic.
Moslem, Serb and Croat leaders agreed terms during peace talks brokered by
Mr Jose Cutilheiro, the European Community envoy.
The agreement called for an end to mobilisation and the disbanding of all
paramilitary groups to be carried out under the control of EC monitors,
according to Tanjug, the Belgrade-based news agency.
It called for 'all activities which endanger the safety of citizens' to be
stopped within 24 hours. These include 'the cessation of sniper
reconnaissance, the search of flats, the withdrawal of all artillery
weapons' - to be placed under the control of EC monitors.
It was unclear yesterday whether any group had the authority to force the
numerous paramilitary groups to comply with the orders to disband.
Fighting in the republic appeared to abate yesterday but many feared it
would resume when EC officials left Sarajevo, the capital. Radio Sarajevo
reported clashes in several towns in east Bosnia, on the frontier with
Serbia. Tanjug news agency said two bridges were blown up south of Sarajevo.
Sporadic shooting, which has become part of every day life, was also
reported.
Dozens of people have been killed in fighting throughout the republic
following the international recognition of Bosnian independence. Moslems,
who make up 44 per cent of the nearly 4.4m population, and Croats, 17 per
cent, support independence, while the Serbs, accounting for 31 per cent of
the population, are against. They want to remain in a federation with
Serbia, and the smaller republic of Montenegro, a close ally.
Tens of thousands of refugees, mainly Moslems, have been fleeing into the
countryside from towns where the violence is worst.
The accord stipulates that refugees should be allowed to return to their
homes. Representatives of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees
at the weekend said the rival ethnic leaders had signed an agreement
promising humanitarian treatment for refugees.
The agreement also states that territorial changes made by force would not
be recognised. This appeared to be aimed mainly at Serb paramilitary groups
and the federal army. Serb irregulars on Friday seized control of Zvornik, a
predominantly Moslem town in northeastern Bosnia.
The accord calls for talks to resume on the division of Bosnia, which the
Moslems oppose. However, Mr Radovan Karadzic, a leader of Bosnia's Serbs,
said earlier yesterday: 'We reached an agreement to start redrawing the map
of Bosnia-Hercegovina very soon.'

FT  13 APR 92 / Yugoslavia devalues by 57% to fight inflation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURA SILBER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Yugoslav federal government is to devalue the dinar by 57.5 per cent
today, in an attempt to combat soaring inflation.
It follows the announcement on Friday by the National Bank of Yugoslavia
that it would seek rescheduling from the International Monetary Fund, World
Bank and commercial creditors of its Dollars 15bn (Pounds 8.7bn) debt.
'Despite our intention to go on paying our foreign obligations in the second
quarter, we shall have to talk to our creditors on reprogramming our debts,'
said Mr Dusan Vlatkovic, the governor of the NBY.
He said Dollars 2.4bn of currency reserves would be 'wiped out after paying
an estimated Dollars 300m which has been allotted for the IMF and World Bank
and the most basic needs of the Yugoslav federation'.
About a third of the debt is owed to western commercial banks, but the
question of how to divide the debt among the former Yugoslav republics has
not been resolved.
'It is currently impossible to negotiate this question while the war is
going on,' a western diplomat said.
The economic situation in the rump Yugoslav federation - comprising Serbia,
Montenegro and the southern republic of Macedonia - has rapidly
deteriorated.
Exports of Dollars 1.625bn in the first quarter this year were down by at
least 26 per cent on the year before. March exports fell 22 per cent on
February. Prices have soared. Agricultural products and foodstuff prices
this year were 567.2 per cent higher than in 1991.
The Yugoslav dinar is still the official currency in Serbia, Montenegro,
Bosnia-Hercegovina and Macedonia. Croatia and Slovenia, the former Yugoslav
republics which in January were recognised as independent states, have
introduced their own currency.
Economists yesterday doubted the devaluation would shore up the national
currency. The official rate is now 200 dinars to DM1, down from 85 dinars.
'The official rate is still far below the black market rate of one D-Mark to
500 dinars,' economist Ivan Vujacic said. 'We can expect it to fall even
further.' The move to curb inflation, which economist say could reach an
annual rate of 100,000 per cent, follows a 26 per cent devaluation in March.

FT  13 APR 92 / The European Market: Quiet relief at Tory victory's likely
effect on labour costs - Some EC governments may be glad of an excuse to
slow the growth of costly employment laws
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Conservative victory in last week's UK election may have been greeted
with quiet relief in the more cautious European labour ministries.
A Labour victory should have been more to their liking. Labour was committed
to scrapping the Conservative government's opt-out from the Maastricht
social chapter, which extends the scope of EC employment legislation, and
pushing UK industrial relations closer to Europe's more legalistic
mainstream.
It is likely that even in a more liberal Conservative administration the
British opt-out will prevail (possibly amended to allow UK participation in
some aspects of the social chapter).
On the one hand, Britain's 11 EC partners, which have signed the social
chapter, have had fears that the opt-out would give UK employers an unfair
advantage by not having to implement EC-wide minimum rights at work.
But with the EC moving into a period of slower growth, some EC governments
might be glad of an excuse to reduce the growth of potentially costly EC
employment legislation.
The Maastricht social chapter gives the 11 the freedom to move ahead in the
employment field without the UK, but several are likely to argue that until
the UK can be persuaded to join in, changes should be limited. In other
words, a Conservative victory continues to allow other EC governments to pay
little more than lip-service to 'social Europe', if they choose to do so.
Nonetheless, the UK is likely to remain one of the cheaper countries in the
EC, provided it maintains relatively low non-wage labour costs, according to
a recent study for the London Economics group by Professor Doug McWilliams,
an adviser to the Confederation of British Industry. A Conservative
government maintaining the social chapter opt-out makes such a prediction
more than likely.
The study predicts wage and salary levels in Europe will converge less
rapidly over the next 20 years than they have over the past 20.
Spanish wages in 1970 were 29 per cent of those in Germany: in 1990 they had
risen to 66 per cent, to the study said.
What will happen over the next 20 years as the European economies grow
closer together but labour mobility remains restricted by cultural and
linguistic barriers?
Wage volatility will relent, according to Professor McWilliams, thanks to
harmonisation of inflation levels and there will be strong pressure for unit
labour costs to increase no faster than the rate in the leading EC economy,
Germany.
There will also be some further wage convergence, but without significant
movement among the three broad categories that Professor McWilliams defines:
the high-wage zone of Germany, Belgium, Denmark and the Netherlands; the
middle-wage zone of France, Britain and Ireland; and the low-wage zone of
Italy, Greece, Portugal and Spain.
In the high-wage zone, the only significant change predicted is that German
wages will fall from 125 per cent of the EC average in 1991 to 115 per cent
in 2010, as a result of integrating eastern Germany. In the middle-wage zone
Ireland's position will move from 92 per cent of the average to 100 per
cent. In the low-wage zone, Spanish wages will rise slightly and Greek and
Portuguese wages will rise from 45 and 36 per cent of the average to 62 and
57 per cent.
Widely varying non-wage labour costs - such as unemployment or health
insurance paid by employers - complicate the picture. Only three EC
countries - the UK (41 per cent), Ireland (44 per cent) and Denmark (22 per
cent) - keep non-wage labour costs below 60 per cent of wage costs.
Some of the measures proposed in the EC's social action programme, such as
improving minimum maternity leave, could directly increase non-wage labour
costs in those countries where the EC proposal is more costly than the
existing national minimum.
Other measures, such as European works councils for multinationals or
controls on weekly working time, do not necessarily add significantly to
non-wage labour costs. But for a country such as the UK, the short-term
organisational cost of adapting to more regulated European norms, as
embodied in the EC's social action programme, would be quite high.
In 1990 UK wages were 8 per cent above the EC average but non-wage labour
costs were very low, and overall labour costs were 12 per cent below the EC
average.
The UK will still be under pressure to conform to some EC norms. Despite the
opt-out, bigger UK companies which operate in other EC countries will be
affected by some social chapter legislation such as provision for works
councils.

FT  13 APR 92 / US set to block EBRD expansion in east Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS DENTON and JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BUDAPEST
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US is set to block the drive by the European Bank for Reconstruction and
Development for an expanded role in eastern Europe, at the first annual
meeting of the Bank beginning in Budapest today.
Mr Nicholas Brady, US treasury secretary, yesterday categorically rejected
proposals by Mr Jacques Attali, EBRD president, to relax the bank's
stringent commercial criteria for investments and set up a facility for soft
loans.
'That would be a diversion of the EBRD's efforts,' said Mr Brady. He called
on the bank to maintain its focus on promoting private enterprise and
commercially viable projects. 'Economic restructuring would not be advanced
by the EBRD adding a pittance of a soft-loan programme.'
Mr Attali raised the idea of loans on easy terms as a response to the EBRD's
growing realisation over its first year of operation that suitable
investment projects are scarce. The EBRD's room for manoeuvre has proved
limited - on the one hand by the requirement to support only commercially
viable projects, and on the other by the rule that it should not act as a
substitute for private investors.
Mr Attali said in a recent interview: 'The bank has more money than it has
projects.' The EBRD committed about Ecu500m (Pounds 358m) to credit and
equity financing in its first year, a sum which is expected to double and
then redouble over the next two years.
Mr Attali is today proposing the creation of a subsidiary institution within
the EBRD for soft loans in order to circumvent the rule that 60 per cent of
its investments should be in competitive private sector projects.
EBRD officials also saw soft loans as a means of promoting the smooth
conversion of military industries. 'We have to take into account that the
military-industrial sector is huge and still employs a vast labour force,'
said Mr Mario Sarcinelli, vice-president and head of the EBRD's development
arm. 'This sector cannot be converted overnight. An abrupt and radical
recipe would have unforeseeable consequences.'
The emphasis on conversion of military industry follows the bank's increased
focus on the former Soviet Union. The country's disintegration into separate
republics also raised the membership of the EBRD to 55.
Support for Mr Attali from several west European delegations sets the scene
for a sharp dispute with the US at today's meeting of the EBRDs board of
governors. Mr Brady's uncompromising remarks could spark a revival of the
tension between the US, the EBRD's largest shareholder, and some European
countries, which soured the bank's inception.
Mr Brady's remarks came against a background of criticism that multilateral
financial institutions such as the EBRD, World Bank, International Finance
Corporation and International Monetary Fund were still tripping over each
other in efforts to help eastern Europe out of economic crisis. 'For them
all to do each others' jobs is not the way to go ahead,' agreed Mr Brady.
However, EBRD governors have repeatedly stated that its relations with the
other international institutions have improved.

FT  13 APR 92 / Rate cut hopes rest on market reaction
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD BALLS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TREASURY officials are waiting to see the markets' considered reaction to
the election result before deciding whether to cut interest rates.
The pound gained 2 1/2 pfennigs during Friday's trading. But the Treasury
dampened hopes of a rapid rate cut to speed recovery.
'Friday's reaction was not necessarily the last word about whether or not
the election result alters the scope for interest rate cuts,' a Treasury
official said.
City analysts expect the government to resist an early interest rate cut, or
a move to narrow bands within the European exchange rate mechanism until the
recovery is clearly underway.
Mr Bill Martin, chief UK economist at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, thinks the
government will wait to see how much pent-up expenditure was delayed by the
election before deciding whether to cut rates.
The government's room for manoeuvre on interest rates may be limited by high
German rates. UK rates are only  3/4 of a percentage point higher than in
Germany and no ERM country has lower rates than in Germany.

FT  13 APR 92 / Pounds 350m in new funds needed for Canary Wharf
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON and ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
OLYMPIA &amp; YORK, the cash-strapped property developer, will today ask its
banks for some Pounds 350m of new funds for London's Canary Wharf project
and concessions on USDollars 4bn (Pounds 2.3bn) of existing debt.
In presenting a debt restructuring plan, the group will assure the banks
that they should eventually get all their money back once property markets
recover. But it will warn that opposition to the restructuring plan may
cause them enormous losses.
O&amp;Y officials, led by newly appointed financial adviser Mr Steve Miller of
the New York investment bank James D. Wolfensohn, will present the proposals
to representatives of about 100 North American, European and Far Eastern
banks in the ballroom of Toronto's Sheraton Hotel.
Discussions will also take place over the next two days with smaller groups
of banks.
O&amp;Y, which is privately owned by Canada's Reichmann family, is expected to
disclose that its debts total just over USDollars 15bn. Of that amount,
about Dollars 3bn is debt of non-property subsidiaries, such as
Abitibi-Price, the newsprint maker, and Gulf Canada Resources, oil and gas
producer.
The slump in property markets has slashed O&amp;Y's estimate of its total equity
from a peak of CDollars 11bn (Pounds 5.3bn) in 1988 to CDollars 5bn-CDollars
5.5bn.
From being relatively conservatively financed, with a debt-to-equity ratio
of about 50 per cent, the company's debt ratio has moved up to 75-80 per
cent. It has also run out of cash.
O&amp;Y will urge the banks to leave most of the debt in its vast real estate
empire outside the restructuring net. With the exception of Canary Wharf and
a handful of North American buildings, it maintains that cash flow from its
buildings is adequate to meet debt servicing obligations. It will also argue
that including these projects in the restructuring might endanger their
smooth operation, and thus their asset value.
More than two thirds of the Dollars 4bn debt at the core of the
restructuring has been provided by a group of 10 banks, led by Canadian
Imperial Bank of Commerce, Citicorp of the US, Hongkong and Shanghai Banking
Corp, three other Canadian banks and one Japanese bank.
The proposed Pounds 350m financing for Canary Wharf is required for work
over the next two years to ensure that the Docklands project is attractive
to prospective tenants. It also includes O&amp;Y's initial contribution to the
Jubilee Line extension, although the company is expected to try and
renegotiate that commitment.
Mr Paul Reichmann, O&amp;Y's chief strategist, is expected to devote more time
to Canary Wharf. Day-to-day operations in North America will be left in the
hands of a new president, who is likely to be appointed within the next week
or two.
Mr Tom Johnson, the US banker who left the company after only two weeks as
president, has indicated that he will not be returning to O&amp;Y full time. It
has emerged that Mr Johnson's withdrawal was due in part to bank opposition
to certain elements of his remuneration package.

FT  11 APR 92 / Motoring: EC speed limits threat
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STUART MARSHALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FORGET national politics. It is the bureaucrats of Brussels who will ensure
that cars such as the Porsche 928GTS may have only a short life span, writes
Stuart Marshall.
These cars will, regrettably, be victims of a pincer movement from speed
limits on the one hand and fuel consumption limits on the other. This
superbly engineered car is the latest  - perhaps the final  - and
unquestionably the best version of the V8 engined 2+2 introduced by this
idiosyncratic manufacturer in 1977.
Outwardly, it has changed little in 15 years. Under its chubby, slant-tailed
hatchback body much is different. The all-aluminium, 32 valve engine has
grown from 4.5 litres to 5.4 litres, its output to 350 horsepower.
The brakes and wheels are bigger, the tyres wider and squatter. The rear
wheels are driven through either a 5-speed manual or 4-speed automatic
transmission combined with the final drive.
At legal speeds on the road, this magnificent machine is only half awake.
Porsche says it will reach 170 mph (275 kmh) and accelerate hard from 125
mph (200 kmh) in high gear. Alas, it does not say where, though it makes the
point that a 928GTS's performance can only be explored fully on a private
racing circuit. It handles superbly, rides with surprising resilience and
feels quite docile until a prod with the right toe lets the wild beast off
its chain.
The mere existence of the 928GTS is a good reason for wanting to be rich. Of
the 30 coming to Britain from the end of this month (at about Pounds
65,000), 15 have been spoken for.

FT  11 APR 92 / Cookery: Great Cooks and their Recipes
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
'Charcoal kills us, but what does it matter? The shorter the life the
greater the glory.'
Not the words of Napoleon Bonaparte but those of that Napoleon of the
kitchen, Antonin Careme who was often styled 'the greatest cook of all
time.' A delightful evocation of his life re-appears in an updated and
re-illustrated version of Anne Willan's Great Cooks and their Recipes, From
Taillevent to Escoffier (Pavilion Books, Pounds 25) published this week.
Specially-commissioned colour paintings by Michael Boys, and the use of
period paintings and etchings, make it worth its place in the dining room.
Willan gives a potted biography of 14 chefs and choses recipes to illustrate
the strength of each. Recipes appear in their original form with a
re-working for the 1990s cook. The book's most appealing aspect is the
descriptions of the lives of the great cooks. Bedtime as well as kitchen
reading.

FT  11 APR 92 / Lloyds 'ready' to bid for Midland: Counter-offer hinges on
the terms of Hongkong's takeover move
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LLOYDS BANK is likely to make a bid for its rival, Midland Bank, if Hongkong
and Shanghai Bank does not offer enough for Midland in its takeover attempt,
sources close to Lloyds said yesterday.
An adviser to Lloyds said it 'stands ready' to make an offer. 'We are
continuing to look at the situation.'
Another source said Lloyds' continued interest in buying Midland explained
why it had resolutely refused to make any public statements on the subject.
If it were to make a statement about a bid, its scope for changing its mind
would be limited by the Takeover Code.
Hongkong Bank and Midland are in negotiations about the terms of Hongkong
Bank's offer, which is expected to be made in the next fortnight. If
Hongkong Bank offers too little for Midland, Lloyds may make a
counter-offer.
It is understood that Lloyds made an offer of around 400p per Midland share
during a secret takeover approach last month.
Hongkong Bank is expected to offer Midland's shareholders a mixture of
shares and loan notes. In other words, the value of its offer is directly
linked to the strength of its own share price. Since it disclosed its
intention to buy Midland, its shares have fallen by 16 per cent in sterling
terms to 283p last night.
If Midland's talks with Hongkong Bank were to falter, Lloyds would have
little hesitation in pouncing, a source said. 'Midland would be wide open.'
Lloyds also believes it can convince Midland's shareholders they should
support a bid from it rather than from Hongkong Bank. A takeover by Lloyds
would lead to big cost savings, as the two banks would be able to combine
their branch networks, close superfluous outlets and reduce staff by 20,000.
The alternative deal with Hongkong Bank would not lead to comparable
savings.
Lloyds believes it can also make a strong case against the takeover of
Midland being blocked by the UK and European competition authorities.
The re-election of a Conservative government has reduced the likelihood that
a bid would encounter overwhelming resistance in Whitehall and Westminster,
Lloyds feels.

FT  11 APR 92 / BAe to sell stake in business jet arm
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS, Aerospace Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH AEROSPACE yesterday put up for sale a majority stake in its
profitable corporate jets business. The move is part of a rationalisation
strategy designed to focus the group on its core defence and aerospace
activities.
To facilitate the sale, BAe said it was forming a company called Corporate
Jets, which would incorporate its business aircraft activities. These employ
about 1,200 people at Hatfield and Chester.
Corporate jets have been one of the most profitable businesses in the
group's commercial aircraft operations. But BAe has been reluctant to commit
itself to the investment needed to develop a new range of business jets.
Faced with a squeeze on resources, BAe said it had concluded it was in the
best interests of the company and the division to offer a majority stake to
a partner.
City analysts said BAe would find little difficulty in selling control of
the business because several international aerospace companies are seeking
to consolidate their position in the corporate jet market.
They said a 51 per cent stake in the new company could fetch about Pounds
125m.
This would represent about half the value of the corporate jets BAe expects
to deliver to customers this year.
BAe produces the eight-to-10 seater 125 family of medium-sized twin-engine
corporate jets and has 45-50 per cent of the world market for this type of
aircraft.
Since the first version of the 125 was produced 28 years ago, BAe has sold
816 business jets. Recently, it has had to consider investing in the
development of new aircraft instead of relying on derivatives of the
original 125 airframe.
Faced with a squeeze on its resources, in the past 12 months, BAe has opted
to sell majority control of its corporate jet business to a partner that is
prepared to invest in the future development of aircraft.
Kleinwort Benson is advising BAe on the sale and search for a suitable
partner. Companies expected to show interest include the French Dassault
group, Gulfstream and Raytheon-Beechcraft of the US. All three
unsuccessfully bid for Cessna, the corporate aircraft manufacturer which the
US General Dynamics group sold for Dollars 600m (Pounds 340m) to Textron.
BAe has embarked on a substantial rationalisation of its commercial aircraft
operations, which lost Pounds 56m last year.
Apart from the sale of the corporate jet business, it is also looking for
partners for its loss-making regional aircraft activities.
The company intends to focus its longer-term commercial aircraft operations
on its 20 per cent stake in the European Airbus programme.

FT  11 APR 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Rate cut sustains advance in
the Dow
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
US STOCK markets continued to draw strength from Thursday's interest rate
cut, with share prices posting solid advances, writes Patrick Harverson in
New York.
At the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 30.41 at 3,255.37. The
more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 also ended firmer, up 3.63 at
404.27. The Nasdaq composite index of over-the-counter stocks, however, gave
up its early gains, and ended down 2.51 at 584.24.
Turnover on the NYSE was heavy at 201m shares, and advances led declines by
a ratio of more than two to one.
The momentum provided by the quarter-point cut in the federal funds rate
sustained the market for a second day. The easing of policy relieved
investors, who were concerned that the economy lacked sufficient stimulus to
stage a decent recovery. The rate cut also raised hopes that the Fed may
loosen the monetary reins further in the near future.
The only hiccup yesterday came in the consumer prices data, which showed an
increase in March of 0.5 per cent, well above market estimates. The news
sent bond prices tumbling - theyield on the benchmark 30-year bond briefly
rose above 7.9 per cent - but failed to disturb sentiment in the equity
market. Most economists believed that the March CPI figure was an aberration
caused by one-off seasonal factors.
Among individual stocks, Digital Equipment continued to slide following
Thursday's disappointing fiscal third quarter loss, falling another Dollars
3 to Dollars 44 1/4 in turnover of almost 3m shares.
Also lower in the technology sector was Cypress Semiconductor, which dropped
Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 11 after Merrill Lynch downgraded its investment
rating on the stock and cut its first quarter estimates.
First Chicago stood out in the financial sector, rising Dollars 1 1/2 to
Dollars 29 1/2 after reporting first quarter profits of 71 cents a share, up
from 63 cents a share a year ago. Yet, in spite of the cut in interest
rates, other bank and securities industry stocks were in mixed form.
Chemical rose Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 31 3/4 , BankAmerica firmed Dollars
1/4 to Dollars 41 1/8 and Chase Manhattan added Dollars  1/4 at Dollars 22
5/8 , but Citicorp fell Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 15 5/8 , JP Morgan slipped
Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 55 1/4 , and Merrill Lynch gave up Dollars 1 3/8 at
Dollars 50.
On the over-the-counter market, Intel plunged Dollars 6 1/8 to Dollars 51
1/8 in turnover of almost 8.5m shares on news of a drop in first quarter
profits from 95 cents a share a year ago to 86 cents a share.
Ross Systems fell Dollars 3 3/8 to Dollars 10 3/8 after the company warned
it would post a loss of about 30 cents a share for the quarter ending last
month.
Canada
TORONTO STOCKS finished a wild week on a positive note. Based on preliminary
data, the composite index climbed 27.61 points to 3,376.64, about 9 points
on the week. Advances outnumbered declines 365 to 195 on volume of 23,896m
shares and trading value was CDollars 260.8m.
Every sub-group made gains, with the gold group up 2.58 per cent on index.
Management rose 1.23 per cent, real estate was up 1.10 per cent, energy
climbed 1.08 per cent and industrial products were up 1.08 per cent.
Consumer products, and mining were up moderately.

FT  11 APR 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Sterling flies on Tory win
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
STERLING reacted with predictable elan to the news of the Conservative
party's unexpectedly easy election win.
In overnight trading the pound had already risen three pfennigs against the
D-mark. It opened at DM2.8799, climbed over the day, and closed at DM2.8850.
'As soon as the exit polls came out showing the Conservatives in front,
people started piling into sterling and it's gone up in leaps and bounds
ever since,' said the head of one London foreign exchange.
He described the outcome of the election as 'the result the market had
dreamed of' and said the market now expected to see new money from fund
mangers and overseas investors beginning to fly in over the next few days.
As the UK currency continued to strengthen and short sterling futures
soared, there was speculation of a base rate cut. However, some analysts
cast doubt on this scenario, especially with the removal of political
pressure on the Conservatives to do so.
Mr David Mackie, UK economist at JP Morgan, thought the jump in sterling and
the slide in interest rates reflected an unwinding of the political risk
premium that appeared when the election campaign started.
The dollar sprang higher in confused late European trading. Mr Neil
Mackinnon, chief economist at Yamaichi, the Japanese securities house, in
London pointed out that the dollar had managed to shrug off the Federal
Reserve's rate reduction on Thursday.
'This is a constructive sign for the dollar,' he said.
By late afternoon the dollar had jumped to DM1.6360 from a DM1.6235 start
and a DM1.6164 close in New York on Thursday. It rose to Y132.85 from a
start of Y132.28 and a close in New York of Y132.02.
In the US the dollar opened higher against the D-mark and the yen but fell
agains sterling. One factor helping to off set Thursday's Fed easing was a
higher than expected rise in the consumer price index. The 0.5 per cent
increase prompted inflation fears which put pressure on the long end of the
bond market.
The D-mark gained sharply on the Swiss franc, but dealers detected no sign
of intervention by the Swiss National Bank which came into the market twice
last month to support the franc.
In mid-afternoon the D-mark broke through resistance at 92 centimes - a
point last reached in April 1981 - which was the signal for heavy stop-loss
orders to emerge.
The D-Mark ended sharply lower against sterling, closing at its lowest in
London for over five weeks.

FT  11 APR 92 / Major makes a monkey of us all: The Conservatives' success -
and the prospect of 18 years of one-party rule
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOE ROGALY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Welcome to Japan - or is it Italy? Whichever analogy you choose, Britain
feels very like a one-party state this morning. Its people have the right to
change the government, but it is beginning to look as if 57 per cent of them
always remain hopelessly divided, while the other 43 per cent invariably put
the same lot in. By the time of the next election, the Conservatives will
have been in power for 17 or 18 years. Why should they lose then? On
Thursday, they emerged triumphant in the middle of a debilitating recession.
They will surely try to time it better on the next occasion.
They should also be technically well placed to win in 1996 or 1997. Changes
in constituency boundaries are expected to favour the government to the
extent of 10 or more seats. If Scotland is given self-rule - a very big 'if'
in view of Thursday's results  - the price will almost certainly be a
reduction in Scottish, and therefore Labour, representation at Westminster.
More to the point, Mr John Major, the unseasoned prime minister who
surprised everyone except himself by winning, will by then be a mature
leader. He will be able to draw upon five or six years of experience, not to
mention memories of this year's painful campaign. Painful? He has been
almost universally derided over the past three weeks. Clearly this lack of
confidence was misplaced. Under his leadership, soapbox and all, the Tories
attracted more than 14m votes, a record in British polling history. He won
against tougher opposition than any Mrs Margaret Thatcher faced. If he could
pull that off now, in spite of what seemed to many observers to be a
sequence of tactical errors, think how well he should do when his
apprenticeship is long behind him.
To talk in this way is not to qualify my acknowledgement of Mr Major's
achievement. It deserves to be recognised for what it is. He held his nerve
against a barrage of criticism and adverse opinion poll results. His
unassuming personality won through. His sense of the popular mood was
superior to that of all the polls and all the pundits. During the past 21
days, I have written more than once about the possibility of a hung
parliament with the Conservatives the largest party. I said that if they won
more than 315 seats, Mr Major would stay as prime minister. So did others.
Yet during the campaign there were very few who admitted publicly to a
belief that the prime minister would win a secure overall majority. He has
made monkeys of us all. If this gives him quiet satisfaction, he has earned
it.
A reign lasting to 2000 and beyond is another matter. Nobody deserves that.
Continuous power can be bad for the character of anyone, including the
political parties that hold it. In Japan and Italy it has led to large-scale
financial and political corruption. British corruption, actual or potential,
is of a different sort. It is not a case of politicians lining their
pockets, selling favours, or peddling preferment, although none of these is
unheard of in our recent history. It is more a sense of creeping
omnipotence, first noticed under Mrs Thatcher after her third victory in a
row in 1987.
This has already led to the gradual politicisation of the civil service and
the dominance of government supporters in every public body over which the
prime minister or one of his cabinet colleagues can exercise the power of
patronage. We must hope that Mr Major reverts to the earlier custom of
drawing on a wide spectrum of interests and political allegiance when
looking to fill the boards of the Tories' many quangos.
During the past year, I have discussed the possibility of a fourth
Conservative victory with various ministers and expressed such concerns to
them. The reply is threefold. First, we are British. We have a tradition of
relative probity in government. To take one small example - look at how
ministers are denied the use of official cars while on campaign. Second, Mr
Major is not like Mrs Thatcher. He has tried to run a more collegiate
cabinet than she did. He is committed to more open government. He has a
strict sense of the traditional proprieties, as illustrated by his all-party
approach to the conduct of affairs during the Gulf war.
Third, democracy prevails even if the Conservatives come back every time.
The natural party of government is obliged to take into account the
possibility of being turfed out. It can win many elections in a row, but it
will be kept honest and sane by the knowledge that every election is a risk.
It also has to be said that the Japanese economy has done very well under
the continuous rule of a single party. It may be sliding into recession now,
but it has become the most dynamic growth machine in the contemporary world.
Yet it would be rash to assert that the cause of Japan's success is the
apparently permanent rule of its Liberal Democratic party. As to Italy, it
is true that its northern half has prospered. under the Christian Democrats,
who nearly always provide the prime minister in their coalitions. Yet its
governance is not often praised, and rarely as an example for Britain to
follow.
The reason is plain. Coalitions are anathema to the English. The idea of
alternating bouts of power by opposing parties is ingrained in the national
character. It seems like a necessary ingredient of our democracy. It will be
absent unless the non-Conservative opposition finds a way of winning
elections. You can see part of what has to happen by considering the last
three contests. In 1983, Labour's worst post-war year, Mr Michael Foot led
the people's party downhill to a mere 27.6 per cent of the total vote. The
Liberals and Social Democrats did almost as well, with 25.4 per cent. In
1987, Mr Neil Kinnock's first election, Labour pulled ahead, to 30.8 per
cent against the Alliance's 22.6 per cent. This represented a 3 per cent
swing back to Labour from the Liberals and the schismatics of the SDP.
There was a further swing to Labour of roughly 4.4 per cent on Thursday. Mr
Kinnock's party ended up at 35 per cent to the Liberal Democrats' 18 per
cent. For most of the campaign, the polls suggested that both Mr Kinnock and
Mr Paddy Ashdown would do better than that, but on the day more closet
Tories fled home from the Liberal Democrats than even the most optimistic
Conservatives could have hoped for.
Some people in the Labour party will now be tempted to argue that one more
heave is required. Then the Lib Dems will be back to the single-figure
percentages that prevailed when Labour won so well in 1945 and 1966. This is
worthy of debate. All that Labour requires in order to achieve such a
consummation is new policies, a new leader, a new party constitution and a
new name. For it does not seem possible for it to get elected while it
advocates redistribution of the incomes of high earners to the public sector
and low-income groups, nor - in spite of his untiring efforts - under Mr
Kinnock, nor while allied to the trade unions that founded it, nor while the
name 'Labour' reminds a vital extra margin of voters of the disasters of the
1970s.
Back to the drawing-board. A second line of argument, propounded in this
space immediately after the 1987 election, is that Labour should make its
peace with the Lib-Dems. That would require new policies, a divorce from the
unions and possibly a new leader. It is not certain that it would work. It
appears that on its own, Labour cannot be elected in sufficient southern
constituencies to win nationally. If it were part of a pre-electoral pact,
the thought of helping it to victory by voting Liberal Democrat might
continue to frighten some voters into the Tories' arms.
If the parties of what is still for convenience called the 'left' were led
by selfless men or women of far-sighted vision there might be hope that
something practical could be constructed. As it is, Labour seems likely to
revert to a period of internal bickering and bids for the leadership, while
the Liberal Democrats must await either the break up of Labour, or a
proposal of alliance, or virtual extinction by a renewed Labour party. Mr
Ashdown does have his eye on a realignment of the opposition parties, or the
resurgence of his own, but he does not have any obvious means of making his
dream come true. If the floundering of competing opposition parties is what
we are in for, Mr Major can safely set his eyes on the millennium.
Konichi-wa. Benvenuti.

FT  11 APR 92 / From now on, he'll do it his way: The changes of emphasis to
be expected in the prime minister's 'classic conservatism' for the 1990s
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Now it is Mr John Major's government. As he stood triumphant in Downing
Street yesterday, the youngest prime minister this century repeated the
pledge he gave in November 1990 to create a nation at ease with itself. He
is assured of five years in office to keep that promise.
This week's mandate from the voters gives Mr Major the authority to shape
the Conservative party in his image. His majority at Westminster may be only
a fifth of that achieved by Mrs Margaret Thatcher in 1987, but in an
election fought in the depths of a recession he secured a share of the
popular vote close to the level she won during an economic boom.
The outlook is not trouble-free. Even if, as Mr Major hopes, the election is
followed by the return of confidence needed to trigger economic recovery,
the legacy of the recession will not be easily brushed aside. Public
borrowing this year looks set to rise above the Pounds 28bn announced only a
month ago in Mr Norman Lamont's Budget. Unemployment could continue to climb
for much of this year. Over the medium-term, economic prospects will depend
on how well industry can adjust to the constraints of a fixed exchange rate.
Ministers were claiming publicly yesterday that the gains made by the
Conservatives in Scotland underlined the strength of the government's case
against devolution. In private they were acknowledging that the pressures
north of the border for more self-government can not simply be wished away.
During the campaign, the prime minister promised a 'great debate' on the
future of the Union. It may be harder to deliver it.
But Mr Major now has the authority to govern without worrying always about
divisions in his party. The team he announces this weekend will be the first
that is his own. He will never be in a stronger position to make his own
decisions about who should sit at the cabinet table. The signs last night
were that it would be a radical shake-up.
Many of the old guard, including Mr Kenneth Baker, the home secretary, and
Mr Tom King, the defence secretary, are expected to depart. Mr Michael
Heseltine, the author of Mrs Thatcher's downfall, can expect a more
prominent role in her successor's government.
Unless a clever device is found to keep him, Mr Chris Patten, defeated in
Bath, will not be in the cabinet, even though he did most to articulate Mr
Major's prospectus for the 1990s. But in any event the party chairman's
social market conservatism is likely to be at the heart of a programme for
the next five years designed to add substance to the change in style and
rhetoric seen over the past 16 months.
Mr Major's victory will herald the largest shake-up of Whitehall
responsibilities since the early 1970s. The Treasury and the department will
both be given greater responsibilities.
A new cabinet-level post will be created to oversee the Citizen's Charter,
to take responsibility for reforms of the civil service, and to monitor a
new drive to improve Whitehall efficiency and public purchasing. A second
new department will merge the responsibilities - currently split between
several ministries - for broadcasting, arts, sports, heritage, tourism and
the film industry.
Most of the duties of the department of energy will be transferred to trade
and industry. Employment will lose charge of tourism and small businesses
but gain women's issues.
It is not just the structure of Whitehall which will change.
Mr Major's succession to the leadership at the height of his party's civil
war over Europe and the poll tax left him with an awkward balancing act. As
Mrs Thatcher's chosen successor, he had to keep faith with her revolution.
Until the Maastricht summit in December, there was always a danger that his
party at Westminster might yet tear itself apart over Europe. But alongside
this defence of his inheritance, the new prime minister had to sketch out a
prospectus for a different future to win back an electorate disenchanted
with permanent revolution.
It did not always go smoothly. During the campaign, he sometimes looked
uncertain as to whether he was addressing audiences packed with his
predecessor's disciples or was seeking to reach out to the disenchanted with
his brand of more caring conservatism.
Now Mrs Thatcher has left the Commons, Mr Major's authority is unassailable.
Some on the right of his party will remain restless over Europe, concerned
that his instincts are to spend rather than cut taxes. If the economic
recovery is long delayed there may be voices questioning sterling's place in
the exchange rate mechanism. But such dissent will have little resonance.
The Conservatives are committed to Mr Major's prospectus.
Those looking for a decisive break with all that has gone before will be
disappointed. But so too will those who believe that Mr Major is a convinced
Thatcherite. The prime minister is a politician guided by his instincts
rather than by any ideological certainties. There is no grand design vision
for the 1990s. Instead, he believes that his personal grasp of the mood and
aspirations of the country can be fitted to the business of government.
People want the choice, opportunity and individual responsibility at the
heart of conservatism during the 1980s; but they also want the welfare state
to which Mrs Thatcher was never fully reconciled.
It was no accident that one of Mr Major's priorities in Downing Street was
to underline that he would remain a trustworthy guardian of a free National
Health Service.
The election manifesto with which Mr Major launched his campaign lays out in
characteristically painstaking detail the promised continuities with the
1980s and the shift in emphasis for the 1990s.
Mr Major called it 'classic conservatism'. A senior colleague described it
as a prospectus for the post-socialist era; a few seconds later he added
that it was one also for a post-Thatcherite world. It is a manifesto as
concerned with practicalities as with political philosophy.
The new government will remain faithful to the central economic 'truths' of
the 1980s. The prime minister believes that the benefits of market economics
 -of deregulation and liberalisation  - have been obscured rather than
discredited by the recession. Low taxes, low inflation, enterprise and curbs
on trades union power remain the precondition for prosperity.
He is convinced of the virtues of privatisation. The franchising of British
Rail passenger services is planned as the precursor to an eventual sale.
British Coal is to be sold and contracts with the private sector for local
authority and Whitehall services are to be accelerated. There are promises
too of further deregulation and plans to weaken public and private
monopolies.
Mr Major is equally serious about his goal of stable prices. His commitment
to the ERM has strengthened rather than weakened since Britain joined two
years ago. A move to the narrow bands is promised after the election.
Ownership, another favourite theme of the 1980s, will be just as central to
the Conservative agenda for the 1990s. The manifesto promises further tax
incentives to encourage savings and another drive to boost home ownership
through 'rents-into-mortgages' schemes. Inheritance tax will be diluted to
ensure that wealth 'cascades' down the generations.
Mr Major has made it clear that the new lower rate band of income tax will
be the route from a progressive, if gradual, move down to a 20p basic rate
of tax.
But there are also distinct changes of emphasis. As one senior colleague put
it yesterday, income tax cuts are 'an aspiration rather than a firm goal'.
Mr Major has little time for those on the right who would like to see the
top as well as the basic rate reduced.
The prime minister stressed repeatedly that the looming explosion in public
borrowing next year as a result of the recession will not produce
post-election cuts in spending on the welfare state. The next spending round
will be tough but Mr Major is a politician who believes that some problems
at least can be solved by spending money.
The election victory will be followed by an acceleration in the education
and health service reforms started by his predecessor. But the final
destination will be different. Mrs Thatcher saw privatisation as the
ultimate goal. For Mr Major, the disciplines of the market are designed to
strengthen state-run health and education services.
None of this adds up to an ideological 'ism'. It may be that in five years
time it will be possible to define something called Majorism. But for now,
the politician who has journeyed from Brixton's Coldharbour Lane to No 10
Downing Street is promising no more and no less than a government which is
responsive as well as radical.

FT  11 APR 92 / Breathing space for Scots Tories: A shifting political
landscape north of the border
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In the paradoxical world of Scottish politics a party has only to take two
seats and produce a decidedly modest total of 11 MPs out of 72 to be awarded
the victor's crown. Yet that was the remarkable position of the Scottish
Conservative party yesterday.
The fact that the party won the election in the rest of the country meant
that it could claim a decisive victory in Scotland. It was vital for the
Scottish Tories to retain all the nine seats with which they entered the
contest, otherwise they would have been in even more of a minority. It was a
triumph to pick up two more, including Kincardine and Deeside which they
lost to the Liberal Democrats in last November's by-election.
Until election night many Scottish Conservatives gave every sign that they
believed opinion polls showing them trailing the Labour party by 14 points
and the Scottish National party by three points. But the bad news is all
behind them. The question is whether their success will lead to a new
approach to the administration of Scotland, and in particular to the issue
of Scotland's constitutional future.
The Conservatives, whose share of the Scottish vote went up by 1.6
percentage points to 25.7 per cent, can claim that their policy of trying to
make the constitutional debate a stark choice between independence and the
status quo was a success. This is despite campaign opinion polls showing
that three-quarters of the Scottish electorate want constitutional change.
The Tories' policy of polarising the opposition over the constitutional
debate pushed up the SNP vote sufficiently to weaken Labour, without
boosting it enough to enable the Nationalists to win Tory seats - though Mr
Ian Lang, the Scottish Secretary, had a close shave in Galloway.
Scottish Tories will find it difficult to change their policy on home rule.
Two committed opponents of devolution won their seats - Mr Michael Forsyth,
the Thatcherite Scottish Office minister, and Mr Phil Gallie, the new MP for
Ayr. Mr Struan Stevenson, an ardent devolutionist, failed to win Edinburgh
South. The Tories also failed to take seats that should have been within
their grasp such as Edinburgh South which stayed with Labour, and
Strathkelvin and Bearsden, on the outskirts of Glasgow, where Labour also
won.
What the Scottish Tories have won is a breathing space. The election result
may even make it possible to change the line-up of familiar faces at the
Scottish Office. 'It would have been very difficult for the Tories to bring
in English MPs to fill the four Scottish Office ministerial jobs when it was
the only way of manning them,' says an observer of the Scottish scene, 'but
now that they have enough MPs to fill them, it could be a lot easier.'
New ministerial faces could open the way for Mr Lang and Mr Forsyth to
escape what has been called 'that grim cookhouse of government' and move to
Whitehall. An expatriate Scot of acceptable Scottish credentials such as Mr
John MacGregor, leader of the House of Commons in the last parliament, could
become Scottish Secretary.
It might eventually be possible to make some modest change in Scotland's
relationship with Westminster which would meet the party's criterion of not
'damaging the union', and partially fulfil the aspirations of some Scots for
some form of self-government.
For the losers, there will be an agonising period of readjustment, made more
bitter for Labour and the Liberal Democrats by the dashing of hopes that a
Scottish parliament may soon be at hand. For the Scottish National party,
Scotland's independence in Europe seems as far away as ever, maybe farther.
Labour and the SNP will be distracted by their own internal difficulties for
months. Labour is vulnerable to the accusation of the SNP that it talked
Scots out of voting for independence by promising a majority Labour
government which would then usher in a Scottish parliament.
In the event it failed at the UK level and its Scottish vote fell three
points to 39 per cent. The SNP's share of the vote was 21 per cent, several
points below its standing in the opinion polls during the campaign but more
than seven points up on 1987.
One faction within the Scottish Labour party covertly favours full
independence, rather than a slow process of devolution. Neither of these
developments now seems possible and the frustration of some Labour
supporters at the election outcome could boil over. Mr Charles Gray, the
Labour leader of Strathclyde regional council, said on election night:
'We'll have to live a little dangerously,' adding that it 'may come to'
civil disobedience. Significantly, Mr Alex Salmond, the SNP leader,
yesterday refused to rule it out.
One possibility for disaffected Labour MPs is to defect to the SNP. Or they
could form a breakaway Labour group along the lines of Scottish Labour
Action, created after the 1987 debacle when Labour won 50 seats in Scotland
but the Tories formed the UK government. Yesterday, Mr George Galloway,
Labour MP for Glasgow Hillhead, called for a 'patriotic front of anti-Tory
forces'. Such a group could co-operate with the Nationalists to strengthen
the forces seeking independence, but this would be opposed by the Labour
leadership.
For now the SNP's priority is to avenge its failure at the polls by
achieving a big vote for the Nationalists and against Labour in the district
council elections on May 7. That, Mr Andrew Welsh, one of the party's three
MPs, said yesterday, is 'the only message that London will understand'. It
did not sound like a message destined to bring the disunited Tory opposition
together.

FT  11 APR 92 / Alleged faking of Ford parts is probed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TRADING standards officers in London are investigating a suspected
international fraud involving counterfeit Ford parts.
Parts suspected of being fake were seized by police when they raided
premises in Haringey, north London. Trading standards officers said no
charges had yet been made but a prosecution was being considered.
Officers confirmed that consignments of allegedly fake Ford spare parts had
been confiscated, and added that there was believed to be a South American
connection in the source of the parts.
Ford said it had experienced difficulties for many years from the
importation of counterfeit parts. It added that the main source of such
parts had appeared to be Taiwan, but the supply now appeared to be coming
from South America and Turkey.
Ford said yesterday: 'We lose considerable revenues from the loss of sales
of genuine parts. But what is equally worrying is that the customer can
suffer. They may be fitting parts that are copies in every respect except in
quality - they could be lethal and dangerous.'

FT  11 APR 92 / Businesses urged to account for goodwill
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COMPANY accounts should include both goodwill and intangible assets on their
balance sheets, a paper commissioned by the Accounting Standards Board has
recommended.
The accounts must also include detailed information on how valuations of the
assets have been determined so that outside observers can assess their
reliability, the authors argue.
Intangible assets are the non-physical parts of a business that generate
future earnings, such as brand names. Goodwill is defined as the difference
between the purchase price of an acquisition and the value of its tangible
assets.
Companies have in growing numbers begun including intangible assets on their
balance sheets.
Mr David Tweedie, chairman of the Accounting Standards Board, said yesterday
that the report was only preliminary and the academics had now been asked to
provide a further study examining practical applications of the concepts.
Although his own previously published views appear to reflect much of the
content of the paper, Mr Tweedie emphasises that the board has not yet
formed a view on the subject. It is expected to produce a discussion
document in the autumn for a standard covering goodwill and possibly
intangible assets.
The study, co-ordinated by Mr John Arnold at Manchester University, says
goodwill on acquisitions comprises three elements: the fair value of any
intangible assets, the present value of benefits arising, and any
underpayment or over-payment. The first two should be included on the
balance sheet and depreciated, the third written off.
The study argues that long-term investments are already treated on the
balance sheet in that way, and that intangibles should be included to retain
consistency.

FT  11 APR 92 / Inflation rate down to 4% last month
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE inflation rate fell last month to 4 per cent from 4.1 per cent in
February, according to figures released yesterday by the Central Statistical
Office.
Behind the change was a relatively large rise between February and March in
prices of petrol and certain types of retail goods, in spite of reductions
in mortgage-interest payments and the prices of seasonal foods.
The overall increase in the retail prices index (RPI) between February and
March was 0.3 per cent. That pushed the index to 136.7 in March, after 136.3
in February, based on a figure of 100 in January 1987.
The change in the RPI in the year to March was 4 per cent, higher than the
3.8 per cent expected in the City. In the year to February, the RPI rose by
4.1 per cent.
The relatively big month-on-month change may be a sign that extra demand is
pushing up prices, an indicator of a hesitant revival in economic activity.
March was the third consecutive month in which the year-on-year rate had
failed to show a rise. In December the figure was 4.5 per cent.
Underlying inflation, as measured by the RPI, excluding mortgage-interest
payments, showed an increase from a year-on-year rate of 5.6 per cent in
February to 5.7 per cent in March. That figure has hovered between 5.6 per
cent and 5.8 per cent for the past five months.
Higher demand was reflected in a 1.5 per cent increase during the month in
prices of clothing and footwear, and a 1 per cent rise in prices of
household goods such as furniture and electrical appliances. The price
increases came after a winter of slack demand which had propelled retailers
into extended price-cutting.
The price of four-star petrol rose by 4p a gallon during March to Pounds
2.19. Together with price rises for used cars and spare parts, that pushed
up motoring costs by 1 per cent for the month.
The upward pressure on the RPI was constrained by a 0.9 per cent fall in
housing costs between February and March - due mainly to a fall in mortgage
payments as the average mortgage rate declined by 0.4 percentage points to
11.1 per cent.
Between February and March, prices of seasonal foods fell by 1 per cent,
thanks mainly to a drop in prices of fresh fruit.

FT  11 APR 92 / Struggle to save the half-life of a silent reactor: A
scientists' campaign to show that an old nuclear station is still safe and
viable
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIET SYCHRAVA
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRADWELL, a quiet village near Southend-on-Sea, is particularly quiet this
month. The humming noise that used to be heard in the village has gone.
Bradwell power station, Britain's oldest surviving commercial nuclear
station, closed this month, its 30th birthday.
It cannot reopen until Nuclear Electric, which owns and operates Bradwell
and the other nuclear stations of England and Wales, convinces the Nuclear
Installations Inspectorate (NII), the industry watchdog, that it is safe.
Today, the station looks deserted. Above the reactor core, a few
white-coated men are gathered round a piece of equipment. Outside, radiation
monitors registering zero radiation stand like silent washing machines in an
old-fashioned launderette.
Nuclear Electric is fighting to reopen Bradwell, commissioned in 1962. Its
efforts to keep running Bradwell and the six other stations of similar
design - named Magnox after the fuel they use  - is controversial. The
stations are all more than 20 years old.
Environmental lobby groups such as Greenpeace believe they are unsafe and
should close. Bradwell is doing its best to convince the public that that is
not true. Posters on the walls of the visitors' room explain why the nuclear
disaster at Chernobyl could not happen at Bradwell.
Nuclear Electric has spent Pounds 10m on refurbishing the station, on top of
a share of the Pounds 80m it has allocated to all seven Magnoxes.
It wants the inspectorate's permission to continue operating Bradwell for a
further seven or so years. Nuclear Electric also hopes to extend the life of
the other Magnoxes beyond 30 years.
That means intensive testing to show that the stations are safe. Mr Andrew
Clarke, the company's technical services manager, says: 'We've inspected the
pipes - to check they are still fit  - and the cables, using special
infra-red techniques to check for overheating.
'We have looked at the reactor vessel. We have a scheme which monitors
samples of the plate material inside the vessel . . . We'll finish the
inspection by the end of June, and we think the NII will reach a view by
then.'
Opposition to extending the life of Bradwell and its sister stations is
strong. Nuclear Electric's critics say the company is stretching out the
life of the Magnoxes because it cannot afford to close them. If it did, it
would lose revenues from the cheap power they generate - because their
capital costs are written down - and would have to pay to dismantle or
decommission the stations.
Mr Simon Roberts, energy campaigner for Friends of the Earth, says: 'The
cost of decommissioning is beginning to make the PSBR look like small
change.' He believes the government itself might could find it hard to do
without the revenues from the stations. 'There will be economic pressure to
keep them open,' he says.
Nuclear Electric agrees that decommissioning the eight Magnoxes will cost
around Pounds 1,200m, but denies ignoring safety issues because of economic
pressure. The Magnoxes, Nuclear Electric argues, are 'good engineering
workhorses.' Their original 20-year lifespan was not based on the length of
the period during which they would be safe. It was simply an economic
payback period.
Bradwell, with its 1960s design, certainly looks out of date. But, Mr Clarke
stresses, safety is paramount.
Whatever the government and the NII decide, Bradwell's fate will only be
postponed, not averted. Within another decade, the station will be
permanently silenced.

FT  11 APR 92 / Company failure may affect football clubs: Ability to meet
costs incurred after promotion to higher divisions may be jeopardised
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LIQUIDATION last month of a small insurance company may leave a number
of professional football clubs with financial difficulties. Continental
Insurance, which went into liquidation on March 27, sold a range of
high-risk insurances - including 'prize indemnity' contingency policies for
football clubs which protect against extra costs incurred as a result of
promotion to higher divisions.
With the league season coming to a close, a number of clubs that bought such
prize indemnity policies are running for promotion and will incur
substantial financial obligations as result.
The cash needed to pay contractually agreed bonuses to players and improve
grounds to higher-division standards would have come from their insurers,
but Continental's liquidators are unlikely to have sufficient resources to
meet potential claims.
Already many clubs, especially those in the lower divisions of the English
football league, are under financial pressure with the cost of ground
improvements a significant obstacle. In 1990 the government accepted the
terms of the Taylor Report into safety at football grounds and insisted that
first-division and second-division clubs should have all-seater stadiums by
1994, while third and fourth-division clubs should introduce similar
facilities by 1999.
Aldershot FC went into liquidation last month, while a number of other clubs
have decided to adopt semi-professional status.
Continental has found itself in difficulties partially as a result of more
than Pounds 700,000 in losses incurred on prize indemnity policies covering
the 1990-91 season. Its total shortfall amounted to Pounds 810,000,
according to a statement of affairs signed by directors on February 20. The
deficiency takes into account a reserve for unexpired premiums of Pounds
1.38m.
In a report to creditors, joint liquidators Mr David Buchler of Buchler
Phillips and Mr Chris Hughes of Cork Gully say that losses from high-risk
travel have also been particularly troublesome for the company.
Accounts for last year are not yet available, but in 1990 Continental
reported pre-tax losses of Pounds 1.3m on premium income of Pounds 3.8m,
compared with claims and expenses of Pounds 5.1m.
Total underwriting losses in 1990 amounted to Pounds 1.17m, and last year
reached Pounds 1.18m. Losses for 1990 losses include Pounds 700,000 incurred
on football contingency contracts during the 1990-91 season. In addition,
loans of about Pounds 2m made by Continental to its parent company,
Yorkdale, have proved to be irrecoverable, according to Cork Gully.

UK STEEL output last month was 2.7 per cent higher than in March last year,
British Steel reported yesterday. It added that signs of an overall recovery
nevertheless remained muted.
The rise was caused largely by the need to boost stocks in anticipation of a
scheduled six-month rebuilding of one of the main blast furnaces at British
Steel's plant at Port Talbot in south Wales.
Output averaged 334,700 tonnes a week in March, 2.6 per cent down on
February. Production in the first three months of this year averaged 325,900
tonnes a week, 4 per cent higher than the 313,500 tonnes recorded in the
first quarter of last year.

FT  11 APR 92 / Criticism over revenue disclosure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FEW COMPANIES disclose enough information about their revenues in annual
reports, according to a survey of 50 companies in construction and
contracting.
The survey by Company Reporting, the Edinburgh-based monitoring service of
accounts, says that only 28 companies in its survey specified how income was
spread over the life of a contract.
Revenue recognition policies - which determine over what period revenues
should be included in the accounts - vary considerably between companies and
sectors.
Revenue may be recognised at differing times in accounts, such as after
completion of contracts, invoicing, delivery of goods or receipt of cash.
The different policies adopted can have a significant impact on the figures
produced in accounts.
In a separate analysis of 34 companies in the business-services sector, it
finds at least eight with evidence of revenue from long-term contracts, of
which three do not show how revenue is accounted for.
Auditors are persuading clients to disclose more information on accounting
policies that can give a misleading impression that there has been a
material change, Company Reporting warns.
It quotes KPMG Peat Marwick, the accountancy firm, which for the first time
instructed Macarthy, the pharmaceuticals group, to include a statement last
year that research and development expenditure is capitalised, although
there had been no change in its accounting.

FT  11 APR 92 / Financial services report optimism
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
OPTIMISM is increasing in Britain's financial services sector even though
business volumes are still falling, according to a survey of business
prospects among 361 companies by the Confederation of British Industry and
Coopers &amp; Lybrand Deloitte, the accountancy firm.
Against that, banks, which comprise the largest single financial services
industry, were more pessimistic than in the last quarter of last year.
The survey, carried out between February 27 and March 18 and published
yesterday, shows that 31 per cent of financial institutions expect their
business volumes to rise in the present quarter, compared with 17 per cent
expecting a decline.
The strongest signs of optimism came from venture capitalists, fund managers
and building societies.
Although business volumes are still falling, companies in the survey report
that their overall profitability is improving for the first time for two
years. Insurance brokers and fund managers experienced the highest increases
in profitability, but falls in profitability were reported by banks, venture
capitalists and life assurance companies.
'Rising profitability is being helped by the rise in the value of fee,
commission, or premium income received and a marked reduction in operating
costs,' the report says. In spite of the drop in business volumes, almost
all types of financial services companies are managing to bring down their
operating costs. The only exceptions recorded in the survey are insurance
brokers.
Building societies and general insurance companies say they expect a further
reduction in their costs over the next three months.
At the time of the survey, though, the financial services sector appeared
uncertain about future investment decisions. Although investment in
information technology looks likely to continue to grow over the next 12
months, most companies reported cuts in investment in land and building.
Although the banks surveyed are more pessimistic than other types of
institution, with 30 per cent reporting reduced optimism, the report says
there are signs that the decline in business confidence among banks is
slowing.
Banks say the volume of business they are handling declined in the first
quarter of the year for the seventh successive quarter.
They are not expecting business volumes to change in the present quarter,
and three quarters of the banks in the survey say low demand is likely to
limit business growth.

FT  11 APR 92 / Election 1992: Party professionals come of age in new intake
 -A close look at the make-up of the Commons, which will reconvene on April
27
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BYRON CRIDDLE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE NEW intake of MPs provides stark proof that politics has become less a
job done by Conservative lawyers or Labour teachers than by political
full-timers who have spent their adult lives on their party's payroll.
Five are past or present members of Labour's Walworth Road staff: Peter
Mandelson (Hartlepool), Jean Corston (Bristol E), Mike Capes (Ilford S),
Gordon Prentice (Pendle) and Janet Anderson (Rossendale and Darwen).
The same trend appears in the new Conservative intake, with John Wittingdale
(Colchester S &amp; Maldon) Judith Chaplin (Newbury) and Hartley Booth
(Finchley) all from No. 10 Downing Street; David Faber (Westbury) from
Central Office; and David Willetts (Havant) from the Centre for Policy
Studies.
Such professional politicians are mainly pragmatists anxious to secure and
retain office, and thus are important ballast for their leaderships.
Union links. A significant proportion (14 per cent) of the new Labour intake
has built careers on union payrolls, notably Keith Hill (Streatham), Rachael
Squire (Dunfermline W), Angela Eagle (Wallasey), George Mudie (Leeds E),
Richard Burden (Birmingham Northfield), John Spellar (Warley W) and Roger
Codsiff (Birmingham Small Heath).
The new parliamentary Labour party comprises 138 union-sponsored MPs,
roughly the same proportion as in the last Commons. This underscoring of
Labour's union links implies less a radical reversal of Conservative trade
union legislation than a defence of the public sector, in which a large
number of the sponsored MPs' unions are active.
Richard Burden's union (the local government union Nalgo), for example, took
full-page advertisements in newspapers during the campaign to attack
Conservative health and education policies.
Equally, however, union insiders such as Keith Hill are the sort of
ambitious pragmatists whose defence of the public sector (in Mr Hill's case,
the railways) will be tempered by a broader view of their party's
longer-term interests. Ambitious politicians in marginal Labour seats have
an interest in breaking the historic pattern of short periods of Labour rule
interrupted by four-term Conservative governments.
Local government leaders. The large number of new Labour MPs from local
government underlines Labour's involvement in defence of the local authority
infrastructure.
Many of Labour's new intake are senior local government figures with long
experience of running municipal authorities: George Mudie (Leeds E), Jamie
Cann (Ipswich), John Gunnell (Leeds S &amp; Morley), Neil Gerrard (Walthamstow),
John Heppell (Nottingham E), Clive Betts (Sheffield Attercliffe) and John
Austin-Walker (Woolwich).
The only equivalents in the new Tory intake are those from 'flagship'
Conservative councils: Wandsworth's Sir Paul Beresford (Croydon C) and
Bradford's Eric Pickles (Brentwood and Ongar).
Political families. The decline of the old-Etonian contingent to 33 MPs (31
Conservatives, two Labour) confirms the demise of the political dynasties,
reduced now to the Churchills, Guinnesses (Channons and Lennox-Boyds),
Benns, Hoggs, Hurds, and Emma Nicholson's family, which has provided many
MPs in an unbroken line since the 1890s.
But the continuing importance of family is reflected in the election of Lady
Olga Maitland (Sutton &amp; Cheam) and Bernard Jenkin (Colchester N), both
children of former MPs, David Faber (Westbury), grandson of Harold
Macmillan, and Geoffrey Clifton-Brown (Cirencester &amp; Tewkesbury), whose
family has provided five MPs this century.
Labour's new intake brings a husband and wife to the Commons - Bridget
Prentice (Lewisham E) and Gordon Prentice (Pendle) - to rival the
Conservative couples, the Bottomleys and the Wintertons. The election of
Helen Jackson (Sheffield Hillsborough) brings to the House the sister of a
former MP, Chris Price.
Retreads. The new intake includes 16 former MPs, nine Conservative, three
Labour and one Liberal Democrat.
Conservatives in this bracket are Derek Spencer (Brighton Pavilion), Richard
Ottaway (Croydon S), Gerry Malone (Winchester), Michael Ancram (Devizes),
Piers Merchant (Beckenham), Warren Hawksley (Halesowen &amp; Stourbridge), Mark
Robinson (Somerton &amp; Frome), Iain Sproat (Harwich) and John Horam, whose
parliamentary career includes periods as first a Labour and then an SDP MP,
and who now sits as Conservative member for Orpington.
Labour's retreads are Bryan Davies (Oldham C &amp; Royton), John Spellar (Warley
W) and Nick Raynsford (Greenwich). The Liberal Democrats returned Paul Tyler
(Cornwall N). Three MEPs - all Labour  - have affirmed their faith in the
importance of Westminster over Strasbourg by entering the Commons: Llew
Smith (Blaenau Gwent), Geoff Hoon (Ashfield) and George Stevenson (Stoke S).
Two other past or present MEPs (Richard Balfe, Labour, and Andrew Pearce,
Conservative) failed to make the reverse Channel crossing.
Women. The new House contains a record 57 women MPs, up from 44 in the last
parliament. Labour, in spite of the failure of half its women candidates to
secure election in key marginals, supplies 34 of the new total, including
Tessa Jowell (Dulwich), Glenda Jackson (Hampstead &amp; Highgate) and Barbara
Roche (Hornsey and Wood Green).
Because of the selection of six new women for safe seats - such as Cheryl
Gillan (Chesham &amp; Amersham) and Angela Browning (Tiverton) - the Tories have
ensured that, in spite of the defeat of women such as Lynda Chalker in
marginal seats, the government benches contain 20 women, an increase of
three on the last parliament. Elizabeth Lynne's election at Rochdale means
the Liberal Democrats have two women MPs.
Ethnic minorities. The new House has two new Asian MPs, joining the three
black and one Asian MPs (all Labour) elected in 1987. Piara Khabra retained
Southall for Labour in spite of the rebel candidacy of the deselected MP Syd
Bidwell. Tory attempts to bring black MPs on to their benches succeeded at
Brentford &amp; Isleworth, where Nirj Deva retained the seat. But at Cheltenham,
the resistance to the imposition of black barrister John Taylor almost
certainly eased the way for the Liberal Democrats. Age. In the tough world
of contemporary politics, few MPs stay on after 70. Edward Heath (Old Bexley
&amp; Sidcup) and his Conservative colleague Sir Trevor Skeet (North
Bedfordshire) are the only remaining septuagenarians. Six Labour MPs were
born in 1923; the oldest is Andrew Faulds (Warley E). Mr Heath and Mr Tony
Benn are the only survivors of the 1950 parliament. The youngest MP remains
the re-elected Liberal Democrat, Matthew Taylor (Truro), born 1963.
Political trends. How leftwing is the new parliamentary Labour party?
No more than a handful of the new MPs are likely to identify with the
hard-left Campaign group, which had some 30 members in the last House.
Michael Connarty (Falkirk E), John Simpson (Nottingham S) and John Denham
(Southampton Itchen) were noted for their hard left attitudes in the early
1980s, but all are said to have mellowed.
It remains to be seen whether the frustration of national defeat prompts
dissent from the more hardline MPs. The Tories' attempt to focus on MPs who
have dropped or concealed their unilateralist credentials savours a little
of flogging a dead horse.
Nor does Europe carry such divisive potential, with many leftwingers
reconciled to the European Commission's social policy. With Mr Kinnock's
leadership in the balance, however, it is unclear whether the broad
consensus will remain.
Many of the new Conservative intake were selected during Mrs Thatcher's
reign and reflect its orthodoxies. Men such as Liam Fox and Charles Hendry
(High Peak) were teenagers when she won the leadership and came of age
politically during her premiership.
These 'Thatcher's children' may be expected to carry their political
nostrums with them through their parliamentary careers as did the One Nation
generation of retiring MPs such as Sir Ian Gilmour and Sir Paul Dean, whose
seats they have inherited.
Others of the new intake are explicitly identified with Thatcherite
positions, notably John Wittingdale (Colchester S), Sir Paul Beresford
(Croydon C), Iain Sproat (Harwich) and Warren Hawksley (Halesowen &amp;
Stourbridge).
A new intake heavily weighted by such people has a potential for embarassing
a government with a relatively small majority.

FT  11 APR 92 / Election 1992: Ex-MPs' pay-offs could cost Pounds 2m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE 80 MPs retiring and the more than 40 others who lost their seats could
cost the taxpayer about Pounds 2m in resettlement grants.
The grants, which are additional to the arrangements for contributory
parliamentary pensions, are at least half of the MPs' annual salary,
currently Pounds 30,854. Even if all those leaving parliament were to
qualify for the minimum only, it would cost Pounds 1.85m.
An MP becomes eligible for higher percentages on calculations based on age
and number of years at Westminster. An MP aged 55-64 who has served for 15
years or more is entitled to a full year's salary on leaving the Commons.
The taxpayer will also be paying out lesser sums for the ministers who lost
their posts, and who are entitled to three months' ministerial salary. These
include Mr Francis Maude, Mr Christopher Chope and Mrs Lynda Chalker.
More than 900 candidates failed to win the 5 per cent of the vote needed to
keep their deposits, contributing Pounds 454,000 to the exchequer. The
biggest net contributor was the Natural Law Party - its 303 candidates
averaged only a couple of hundred votes, yielding Pounds 151,500. The Greens
handed over Pounds 127,500 from 255 candidates.

FT  11 APR 92 / Election 1992: Waverers frightened back into the fold - The
Tories played on fears of higher taxes to hang on in the south
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEAR . . . and yet so very, very far. In a range of crucial southern
constituencies which Labour had to win to take office, the Tories held on
with reduced majorities, leaving the shire counties almost as strongly
bathed in ultramarine as they had been in 1987.
Fear of the effect of a Labour government on mortgage payments and taxes,
skilfully and brutally played upon by the Conservatives in the final days of
campaigning, steered waverers firmly into the Tory camp.
Mr Alan Whitehead, the Labour leader of Southampton City Council, who
achieved a 5.6 per cent swing but failed by 585 votes to unseat the Tory
incumbent in the city's Test constituency, concluded glumly yesterday: 'Neil
Kinnock succeeded in making Labour electable, but not elected.'
As a consolation prize, Labour gained Southampton Itchen with a 6.6 per cent
swing over the Conservatives.
Mr Whitehead said the Tories succeeded in 'scaring voters into the polling
booths' with a cascade of leaflets warning the electorate of financial
disadvantages under Labour. 'People's hands hovered over Labour, but they
decided to hang on to nurse for fear of finding something worse,' he said.
The Tories lost Thurrock in Essex on a 1.8 per cent swing to Labour, but
hung on to Basildon, Swindon, Slough and Dover, and successfully defended
Portsmouth South against a well-organised Liberal Democrat drive.
Apart from unseating Mr Chris Patten in Bath, the Liberal Democrats' only
southern scalp was Cheltenham, taken with a 1,668 majority. Antagonism by
Tory traditionalists to the black Conservative candidate, Mr John Taylor,
was undoubtedly an important factor behind the 5.2 per cent swing to the
Liberal Democrats in the spa town. Liberal Democrat organisers yesterday
angrily accused the Tories of organising a last-minute smear campaign
against Mr Nigel Jones, the new MP.
Mr Don Foster, the Liberal Democrat victor in Bath, with a 5 per cent swing
in his favour, toured the city yesterday in an open-top bus. But he said he
was 'terribly disappointed' by the poor Liberal Democrat showing nationwide.
Mr Patten's downfall was caused not just by poll tax protests, but also by
voters' desire for a return to 'compassion' after the 'selfishness' of the
Thatcher years, Mr Foster said.
However, Mr Nick Troup, a healthfood shop proprietor, who helped organise
the tactical voting campaign that swayed the Bath result, was sceptical
about prospects for a change in direction. Mr Foster's win vindicated two
years of planning to unseat the Tory chairman, Mr Troup said. But the
prospect of five more years of Conservative government was 'a nightmare'. Mr
Troup said he might emigrate to Bombay.
Elsewhere in the south, the Tory mood was understandably buoyant. Mr Simon
Coombs, the acerbic MP for Swindon, who achieved a reduced 2,826 majority,
said: 'Tory voters were dissatisfied with government policies but fearful of
the alternative. If someone shoves you in the arm, you don't shoot yourself
in the other arm.'
Mr Coombs said that Labour's defeat showed that Britain was 'now a
homeowning, share-owning democracy that doesn't want its freedoms tampered
with'.
Labour faced a terrible dilemma, he added. 'If they put forward policies
which are not in the interest of these people, they do not get the votes. If
they do put forward such policies, people say 'why vote for them?''
Mr John Watts, returned in the marginal seat of Slough with a slender 514
majority, said 'the Kinnock factor' was the main reason behind the Tory
surge. Mr Watts had targeted the 4 per cent of the Slough electorate
identified as uncertain Tory voters. Party organisers also pulled out all
the stops in bringing supporters to the polls.
'No one who said they would vote for us didn't vote for us, unless they were
dead,' Mr Watts said. 'If we can hold on to the same share of our vote in a
recession as after the Falklands war and during the 1987 boom, it suggests
we have a firmly entrenched chunk of support. Unless there is some
realignment in the opposition there is no alternative government,' he added.

FT  11 APR 92 / Election 1992: Labour retains Welsh heartland
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY MORETON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE TORY dream of chal-lenging Labour superiority in its south Wales
heartland lay in tatters yesterday - while Plaid Cymru, the Welsh
nationalist party, was celebrating the fact that it now has more MPs than
the higher-profile Scottish National party.
From a record 14 of the principality's 38 seats in 1983, the Tories dropped
to six in 1987, a figure they could not improve on yesterday. 'A mixed bag,'
Mr David Hunt, Welsh secretary, called the results.
The six included retaking three by-election losses - Monmouth and the Vale
of Glamorgan from Labour and Brecon and Radnor from the Liberal Democrats.
The Tories lost Delyn, Pembroke and Cardiff Central to Labour.
The Brecon result, an-nounced just after lunch yesterday after a recount,
means that for the second election running Wales has the seat with the
smallest majority in Britain. Five years ago Mr Richard Livsey held the seat
by 56. Now Mr Walter Sweeney has a majority of 17.
If the Conservative dream has been badly dented Plaid has every reason to be
pleased. Although a minuscule force in terms of votes cast, the party
increased its number of seats from three to four by capturing Ceredigion and
Pembroke North from the Liberal Democrats and ran Labour a very close second
in Carmarthen.
Mr Dafydd Williams, Plaid secretary, said the party had 'now come out of its
Gwynedd fortress'. Plaid's three seats in the last parliament had all been
won in the one Welsh county where Welsh is very much the medium of
conversation.
Mr Dafydd Wigley, the party leader and MP for Caernarfon, pointed out that
Plaid still had to win substantial votes in the industrial valleys of south
Wales. Here its share of the vote was very small: 1,659 in Gower, 1,606 in
Mr Neil Kinnock's Islwyn, 716 in Newport East and 653 in Newport West.
With the Liberal Democrats losing two of their three seats, Wales remains
what it has been since the early 1920s - Labour territory. Labour made a net
gain of one seat, taking its total to 27 out of the 38 available.
Labour polled well in Wales and pushed up its majorities handsomely.
Mr Alun Michael, returned for Cardiff South and Penarth, and more than
doubling his majority, said: 'We have come out of the election with
increased authority. The result nationally was disappointing but we can be
satisfied with that in Wales.'
The question of devolution was never a real issue but whether it will recede
from the voters' minds is another matter. Mr Michael said there was 'a
consensus among all parties of a need for change'. Welsh secretary Mr David
Hunt would not necessarily agree with him.

FT  11 APR 92 / Election 1992: Scottish opposition shares out the blame
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON and CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LABOUR and the Scottish National party angrily blamed each other for their
loss of a seat each to the Tory party, while Mr Ian Lang, the Scottish
secretary, claimed a mandate to rule Scotland in spite of holding only 11 of
the 72 Scottish seats.
Mr Alex Salmond, leader of the SNP, blamed its poor electoral showing on
opinion polls a week before the election which convinced SNP waverers that
Labour was about to win the election in the UK and could deliver its promise
of a Scottish assembly.
He said Labour had conned the Scottish people and delivered them into the
hands of a fourth English Tory government.
Mr Donald Dewar, shadow Scottish secretary, attacked the SNP for splitting
the vote in seats including Stirling, permitting Mr Michael Forsyth's
re-election.
Condemning the SNP as isolationist and 'constantly unconstructive', Mr Dewar
said it must compromise on its absolutist position.
Both Labour and the SNP argued that the Tories had no mandate to pursue
policies Scotland had rejected. The Conservatives would face serious
political troubles if they ignored calls for constitutional reform, Mr Dewar
warned.
But Mr Lang insisted: 'We are the legitimate voice for the people of
Scotland. We are the United Kingdom government.'
He did not rule out the possibility of a referendum on constitutional
change. He also hinted at working more closely with other parties in
Scotland.
Mr Salmond spoke of the 'frustration, anger, disappointment and despair that
will be felt in Scottish society that once again Scotland is to be faced
with another term of an English Tory government elected on the votes south
of Birmingham'.
Mr Andrew Welsh, one of the SNP MPs returned, said the election result had
proved that independence was the only way for Scots to be properly
represented. 'The devolution option is a road to nowhere. It has failed
where it always will fail, at the London Westminster road block,' he said.
Mr Dewar, pressed to spell out what Labour could now do to achieve
devolution, said it would continue campaigning. He rejected suggestions
Labour faced a 'doomsday scenario' in Scotland - the Tories ruling on a
minority vote and denying influence to the majority.
Mr Dewar denied that the party could face defections from within its ranks -
but signs of potential division were already apparent yesterday. Mr George
Galloway, re-elected MP for Glasgow Hillhead, called for a 'patriotic front
of anti-Tory forces' and a revamping of the constitutional convention.
'We're going to have to extend the hand of friendship to the SNP and they'll
have to be big enough to accept it,' he said.
Mr Salmond said the SNP was looking at the 'potential meeting of minds' with
individuals from other parties who shared the eventual goal of independence,
but rejected joining the pro-devolution constitutional convention.
Repeated questions about whether he would rule out civil disobedience met a
stone wall from Mr Salmond.
For the Scottish Liberal Democrats, Mr Malcolm Bruce said: 'Scottish
Conservatives must not forget that their gains have been made as a result of
a split opposition and does not represent a vote of confidence in the status
quo; 75 per cent of the Scottish electorate voted against this government.'
The case for electoral reform was now unanswerable, he said.

FT  11 APR 92 / Election 1992: Sinn Fein loses Belfast West after tactical
vote
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM COONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SINN FEIN, the political wing of the Provisional IRA, yesterday lost its
Belfast West seat after the extremist loyalist Ulster Defence Association
advised the strongly Protestant Shankill area to vote tactically for a
moderate nationalist candidate.
The defeat of Mr Gerry Adams, who had never taken up the Commons seat he won
in 1987, by local GP Mr Joe Hendron of the Social Democratic and Labour
party, brought diverse reactions ranging from claims of an SDLP
'breakthrough' to a warning that military actions by the IRA could be
stepped up.
Mr Adams maintained his vote in the constituency at over 16,800, and Mr
Hendron appears to have won largely as a result of tactical voting by
Unionist supporters.
Unionist leaders urged the minority Protestant community in Belfast West to
vote for the Ulster Unionist party, but the UDA, which has a strong presence
in the Shankill area, recommended a tactical vote in favour of the SDLP.
The UDA put out a leaflet on the Shankill Road which said a vote for the UUP
was 'a vote for Sinn Fein'.
The UUP vote in the constituency fell 37 per cent to 4,766 from 7,646 in
1987, while the SDLP jumped to 17,415 from 14,641, giving it a slim 600
majority over Sinn Fein.
Mr Hendron described the result as 'a rejection of violence, of all
paramilitary groups'.
Mr Seamus Mallon, deputy leader of the SDLP, said it was the 'real
breakthrough' the party had been looking for in its effort to deprive the
IRA of its political base in Northern Ireland.
Mr Peter Robinson, deputy leader of the Democratic Unionist party, warned:
'There are still 17,000 Provo supporters in west Belfast who may now be
about to put both hands on the Armalite. The security forces must be on the
alert for an upsurge in violence now that (Mr Adams) has lost his political
card.'
Mr Adams described his defeat as 'a temporary setback' and Sinn Fein
officials pointed out that their vote had largely held firm throughout the
province.
Mr Jonathan Stephenson, a spokesman for the SDLP, warned: 'It would be wrong
to claim that a major shift to the SDLP has started.'
He said the real test would be in next year's local elections. 'Sinn Fein
has had a good group of community politicians in west Belfast who have done
a lot of work on the ground,' he said.
A question raised by Mr Adams' defeat is whether it will undermine his
recent efforts to forge a separate identity for Sinn Fein from the IRA, or
whether the militarists will once again win the upper hand.
The UUP and DUP have meanwhile seen their overall share of the Northern
Ireland vote slip by about 2 percentage points, adding to the loss of 2.3
points in 1987.
The DUP and UUP put up competing candidates in three constituencies, where a
split Unionist vote would not let in a nationalist candidate. In South Down,
where the SDLP was defending a narrow 731 majority against a UUP challenge,
a recount was needed.
Mr Ian Paisley, the DUP leader, characteristically began his victory speech
on being returned to his seat at North Antrim by singing 'Oh God, from whom
all blessings flow'. In a thinly disguised criticism of his UUP challenger
he said: 'This constituency needs my voice, my representation and the stand
that I take.'
The appearance of the Conservatives for the first time in a concerted
electoral effort in Northern Ireland made significant inroads into both the
Alliance vote and that of the UUP.
Dr Laurence Kennedy, the Tory candidate in North Down, said that, in spite
of his failure to oust the independent Unionist Mr Jim Kilfedder, 'the
Conservative party is now well-established as an electoral force in Northern
Ireland'.
The Conservatives appear to have won about 7 per cent of the overall vote in
the province.

<TEXT>
DAVID AMESS appears to be the only person in Basildon not surprised that
Essex man, as predicted by Margaret Thatcher, had returned him as
Conservative MP.
Like the pundits, residents of this new town were astonished that Labour
could not muster the 2.7 per cent swing needed to capture it. Unemployment
that has doubled, a poll tax among the highest in the country, repossessions
of council houses bought enthusiastically in the boom-boom 1980s - all
should have played into Labour's hands.
But come the crunch, the migrants from the east end of London and their
much-mocked offspring commuting to smart office jobs in the City clung to
the dimming memory of loadsamoney
In particular they judged that Labour would probably increase the costs of
mortgages which a generation ago many would not have dreamed they would ever
have.
'It all boils down to money,' said Phil Hayllar, a mechanic at Churchs
Motorcycles, who has seen sales of the large super bikes collapse. 'People
voted with their pockets.'
'A lot of people have bought their council houses and are right on the
edge,' said Roy Payne, a mini-cab driver who sold his ex-council house at a
profit, bought a bungalow with the proceeds and is now at full stretch. 'We
are very disillusioned by the Conservative party but you can't blame them
for worldwide recession, it's technology that has done that.'
Gary Francis, who works in administration in the City, was caught by higher
mortgage rates. 'I always voted Labour but I wavered thinking about my
mortgage on the house I bought three years ago, a bad time to buy,' he said.
'I couldn't stand Thatcher but John Major is not too bad.'
As damaging as fears of higher interest rates was Mr John Smith's pledge of
tax increases for anyone earning more than Pounds 21,000.
Roy Wood, a security guard, earns over that amount and believes higher taxes
would have hit too many modest earners. 'Most of the people round here are
high earners above that level,' he said. He was thrilled at the savings the
Tory victory will bestow on his son, whose move from Basildon to a career as
an insurance underwriter is what many Essex parents would aspire to for
their offspring.
Poll tax was a factor in Basildon, but not against the Tories, although they
had introduced it. Labour's candidate, John Potter, served on the Labour
council which had such large debts it had to set such a high poll tax.
Yesterday, voters dissecting their preferences in the Jolly Friers pub, had
conjured up clearer images of Labour's 1970s strike record than of the
Tory-induced hardships of poll tax 18 months ago.
'I was surprised Labour weren't given a chance,' said Paul Corey, who runs a
one-man window and carpet-cleaning business, the second part of which has
run into the wall this year because of the recession.

FT  11 APR 92 / Election 1992: Voters follow same pattern across country
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN and IAN HAMILTON FAZEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PATTERN was the same virtually throughout the country. Labour made some
progress, mainly at the expense of the Liberal Democrats. But with the
Conservative vote holding up unexpectedly well, it was not nearly enough.
In spite of a professional and imaginative campaign, Mr Neil Kinnock's party
fell short of its targets in all three of the main marginal-rich regions.
The party fared best in the Midlands, capturing all but one of its target
seats in Birmingham, although the move in the west Midlands was less
conclusive at around 3 per cent.
It did less well in the north-west of England and Greater London, capturing
only about half the critical seats as it fell short of the 7 per cent to 8
per cent swing it required.
In Scotland, the Conservatives confounded pundits by increasing their share
of the vote and picking up two seats, and ministers Mr Ian Lang and Mr
Michael Forsyth survived against the odds. The Scottish National party lost
one of its four MPs with the defeat of Mr Jim Sillars.
Another blip in the overall pattern was in the south-east, where Essex man
spectacularly declined to turn against his 1980s benefactor, notwithstanding
the severity of the regional recession.
In London, Labour's decision to concentrate on 24 marginals in the second
half of the campaign was vindicated as the party secured a greater swing in
these seats than across the whole capital.
But the dozen seats it won was not nearly enough. A swathe of marginals
manifested a substantial but inadequate move to Labour of between 5 per cent
and 6 per cent. Mitcham and Morden provided an early warning sign for the
party, as Ms Angela Rumbold, home office minister, held on in defiance of a
5 per cent swing. It also fell just short in Edmonton, where Dr Ian Twinn
held on for the Tories by some 600 votes.
In the east Midlands, Labour achieved its biggest regional swing from the
Tories at nearly 5 per cent, winning in fine style in Nottingham East and
Nottingham South.
In the north-west, the remarkable firmness of the Conservative vote meant
Labour was even more dependent than elsewhere on squeezing Liberal Democrat
support to make headway.
It did this to a significant degree, with a 4.2 per cent swing away from Mr
Paddy Ashdown's party. But with turnout exceptionally high, it pulled up
short in too many constituencies. Bury South, where Tory Mr David Sumberg
polled just 5 fewer votes than in 1987 but had his majority trimmed to 800,
was typical.
In the region, the Conservatives suffered little or no swing against them in
15 of the 20 marginal seats at stake. Labour won none, the Tories held 10.
Against all expectations, there was a swing to the Conservatives in five of
the marginals and no swing in another three seats. In another eight, the
swing against them was less than 1 per cent.
Only Barrow and Furness showed the sort of swing from Conservative that
Labour was hoping to see repeated across the regions - 2.6 per cent against
the Conservatives and 1.7 per cent against the Liberal Democrats to give
Labour a 4.2 per cent swing and a winning margin of 6.4 per cent.

FT  11 APR 92 / Election 1992: Private sector urged to boost recovery drive
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON and ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CHAIRMEN of City firms and big companies welcomed the Conservative election
victory and urged the private sector to do its part to put the country back
on the road to economic recovery.
'Business must rise to the occasion,' said Sir John Cuckney, chairman of 3i,
provider of long-term finance to small companies, and also chairman of Royal
Insurance. 'We must bring forward our investment plans and take more risks.'
Mr Nigel Rudd, chairman of Williams Holdings, the industrial conglomerate,
said: 'I think people will go out and spend money now the Conservatives have
been re-elected. Our middle managers are very relieved'.
For City firms, the outlook was 'better', according to Mr Peter
Meinertzhagen, chairman of stockbroker Hoare Govett. 'But the market is
still highly competitive', he added.
Merchant bankers expected the takeover market to revive. 'Companies will be
dusting off acquisition plans they shelved in the past few months', said
one.
Mr Brian Pearse, chief executive of Midland Bank, said businessmen's
confidence would improve and that would accelerate recovery. 'A clear cut
result is excellent', he said. Mr Pearse hoped the outcome would give 'a big
boost to the housing market'.
Mr Robin Biggam, chairman and chief executive of BICC, the construction,
engineering and cables group, said: 'The result is just bound to be good for
business. Everyone will feel that much more confident, sterling has
recovered and I now hope we will have the interest rate cut that the country
so badly needs.'
The need for a cut was also stressed by Mr Chris Haskins, who as chairman of
Northern Foods was one of the few top businessmen to express any support for
Labour's policies during the campaign. 'On economic policies, there was not
a lot of difference between the parties,' he said.
He said his company might have accelerated its investment plans had Labour
won, to take account of Labour's promise of increased tax allowances on
capital spending.
However Mr Martin Taylor, vice chairman of the Anglo-American conglomerate
Hanson, said: 'The economic stability of a Conservative government will mean
the investment from the Japanese and Americans will persist when it might
not have had the other lot won'.
The need for the government to improve the competitive position of the UK
economy was stressed by Sir Nicholas Goodison, chairman of the banking group
TSB and also president of the British Bankers Association.
'The government should concentrate on steering the UK into economic and
monetary union with other European Community countries', he said. 'It should
make sure we meet the convergence criteria (a series of economic tests) for
EMU.'
Sir Nicholas, who also called on the government to keep public expenditure
under control, said there were already signs of economic recovery.
Prominent Conservative supporters said they never had any doubt about the
outcome. Sir Tim Bell, head of the financial public relations firm Lowe Bell
and a long-standing adviser to the Conservatives, said: 'I forecast this
result.'

FT  11 APR 92 / Election 1992: Bank joins market surge with big gilts sale -
Billions pour into government bonds; Unprecedented move as Bank of England
trades at 2.30am; Demand high throughout night
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Bank of England early yesterday morning joined a huge surge in market
activity, selling between Pounds 3bn and Pounds 5bn of gilts.
The Bank - acting as investors responded to news that a Tory government had
been returned - took a large bite out of what had previously seemed a
dauntingly large projected borrowing requirement of Pounds 28bn for the
current financial year.
Even the Bank's massive sales did not dent prices, leaving room for UK
companies to issue bonds to take advantage of falling long-term interest
rates.
Investors began to buy gilts heavily from 1.30am yesterday as the first
projections of an outright Conservative victory began to appear, gilts
traders said. Demand remained constant during the night and throughout
yesterday.
'It's probably the most business the market has seen on any day since Big
Bang,' said Mr Andy Tweed, head of gilts at Barclays de Zoete Wedd, one of
the biggest gilts firms. 'It's been huge.'
As investors began to buy the Bank sold unofficially at first, but then, at
the unprecedented time of 2.30am, through an official sale of Pounds 800m of
gilts. It repeated the exercise with a further Pounds 800m at 7.30am as
demand continued.
Further unofficial sales, which are not disclosed, were put by gilt
market-makers at anything between Pounds 1.5bn-Pounds 3.5bn.
BZW estimated that the Bank had sold more than Pounds 4bn of gilts in all.
UK institutional investors, which had sat on cash rather than put money into
the gilts market ahead of the election, probably bought more than Pounds
1.5bn of gilts, said Mr David Shaw, head of fixed income investment at Legal
&amp; General, the large UK insurer.
Driving the enthusiasm was a belief that the danger of a devaluation of
sterling - or a need to put up interest rates to defend the pound  - had
passed with the failure of the Labour party to win at the ballot box.
Investors expressed confidence that longer-term UK interest rates will once
again move downwards towards those of Germany, as the UK's chances improve
of hitting the conditions for European economic and monetary union that were
laid down at Maastricht last year.
The difference between 10-year German and UK bond yields fell to around 1.5
per cent, having touched 2 per cent only a week ago.
BAA and Cable &amp; Wireless were the only UK borrowers to move quickly to take
advantage of the fall in longer-term interest rates in the sterling bond
market.
BAA borrowed Pounds 150m at a yield of 10.5 per cent - a full 1.25 per cent
lower than when it last borrowed long-term just over a year ago.
Cable &amp; Wireless issued Pounds 50m of 10-year bonds. The cost: an all-in
yield of around 10.37 per cent, compared with the 10.5 per cent Cable &amp;
Wireless paid for an identical issue of Pounds 150m of bonds at the
beginning of March (before yields on sterling bonds soared ahead of the
election).
The prospect of falling inflation, declining short-term interest rates and a
move by sterling into the narrow band of the Exchange Rate Mechanism all
point towards greater demand by investors for sterling bonds, treasurers
said.
However, the lack of demand for cash could keep companies away from the
markets in the short term. 'If there is no economic upturn, then why will
companies want to invest?' said Mr Arthur Burgess, treasurer of British Gas.
'The demand I will have for cash will come through for next winter. I'm
perfectly relaxed about sitting on my hands for the next six months.'
The Bank announced it would sell a further Pounds 2bn of gilts on April 29,
marking the first extra-long dated issue of bonds since government finances
moved back into deficit. The bonds will have a life of between 23 years and
28 years, the Bank said, compared with usual issues of up to 20 years.
The longer-dated bonds would appeal particularly to life assurance companies
or pension funds.

FT  11 APR 92 / Election 1992: Allies welcome a clear victory for continuity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN, GEORGE GRAHAM and JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS, WASHINGTON, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SIR LEON Brittan, the Tory politician and the UK's senior EC commissioner,
yesterday welcomed his party's election victory as providing useful
stability and continuity in preparing Britain to take over the presidency of
the EC Council of Ministers on July 1.
The election result boosts Sir Leon's chances of staying on in the
Commission for the next two years and perhaps switching from competition to
EC external affairs - a portfolio he is known to covet.
As long as the UK, as a larger EC member, fields two commissioners, the
convention is that the junior one is nominated by the government from the
main opposition party.
Mr Bruce Millan, a former Labour secretary of state for Scotland who is the
EC regional commissioner, still has a good chance of being renominated,
unless Labour wants someone else.
Mr John Major's government would probably accept another Labour nominee,
unless it was highly controversial, like a choice to put Mr Neil Kinnock,
the Labour leader, out to pasture in Brussels.
In the name of the Commission, Mr Jacques Delors, its president, sent Mr
Major a message congratulating him and looking forward 'to continuing our
fruitful and close co-operation'. If, as is highly probable, he continues to
head the Commission in 1993-94, Mr Delors faces operating separate
constitutional arrangements on social policy negotiated for Britain and its
11 partners at Maastricht.
But Mr Major's victory is valued in Brussels for providing in one corner of
the EC a stability that recent German, French and Italian elections have
shown to be a rare commodity. This was pointed up yesterday, when the
Commission spokesman was asked if the EC executive had sent congratulations
after last week's Italian election. 'Yes, we will send a message to the
Italian government,' he said, 'when there is one.'
PRESIDENT George Bush has enthusiastically applauded the Conservative
party's victory in the UK general election.
'It was substantial, it was wonderful,' he said yesterday morning, promising
to discuss the result more fully at a news conference later in the day.
Mr Bush, who has elevated male bonding to the status of a foreign policy
tool, tried to avoid taking sides during the British election campaign, but
still made it clear he would rather carry on working with Mr Major than have
to develop a new relationship with Mr Kinnock.
'I expect the worst thing an American president could do would be to try to
intervene in an election in another country. I think it would be
inappropriate if I got into picking winners and losers in a British election
or French election or German election,' Mr Bush said last month.
'Having said all that, the respect I have for the prime minister knows no
bounds. John Major is a superb leader, and I work very, very closely with
him.'
Mr Major's battle to win re-election has been viewed in the US as something
of a preview to Mr Bush's own re-election campaign this autumn.
'Like George Bush, he is a 'kinder, gentler' sequel to a highly ideological
predecessor,' commented Mr Joe White, of the Brookings Institution
think-tank, in the Washington Post.
'Each inherited a debt-burdened economy that was about to collapse, angering
the electorate.
'Each is heir to a movement that has remade industrial nations' economic
policies in the 1980s.'
However, Mr Bush has the advantage that by November when the US election
will take place, his domestic economy is expected to be in much stronger
shape. Mr Major cemented his relationship with Mr Bush with an exchange of
gifts.
BRITAIN'S election result was described as good news for Conservatives
everywhere in a personal message to Mr Major from Mr Helmut Kohl, the German
Chancellor.
Mr Kohl said: 'The British people have entrusted you with leadership for
five more years at a time of many international uncertainties and in the
face of world economic challenges.'
According to Mr Carl Bildt, the Swedish prime minister, Labour's defeat
confirmed the picture of a 'deepening crisis for the social democrats and
socialists in western Europe'.
The theme was echoed in France where the socialists have suffered electoral
reverses in recent weeks.
There was no immediate comment from the government, but Le Monde, the
respected daily newspaper, said in its editorial that Mr Major's victory
'sounded the death knell of hopes for all those, not only on the Left, who
believed that Britain was ready for a change'. The Spanish newspapers were
so convinced of a Labour victory that many of them claimed Mr Kinnock had
won in their first edition stories. But Mr Felipe Gonzalez, Spain's
socialist prime minister, chose temporarily to suspend his ideological
affinities with the British Labour party for the sake of improved bilateral
relations between his country and the UK on issues such as the future of
Europe.
In Japan, which has experienced the kind of unchanging party power structure
which is now taking hold in the UK, there was no official reaction to the UK
election result.
In Hong Kong, by contrast, Mr Major's victory refuelled pressure for
political change, with politicians calling on the UK to announce without
delay the next governor for the crucial run-up to the 1997 hand-over to
China.

FT  11 APR 92 / Election 1992: Consumers expected to give fillip to high
street spending
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GUY DE JONQUIERES, DAVID BARCHARD, PEGGY HOLLINGER, GARY MEAD, PHILIP
RAWSTORNE and MICHAEL SKAPINKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE election result sent a wave of qualified elation through Britain's high
streets yesterday as retailers, building societies, travel agents and other
consumer businesses forecast that it would add impetus to a recent tentative
revival in spending.
However, views differed sharply over the likely speed and strength of a
recovery. It was not always clear how far attitudes were influenced by
relief that a long period of political uncertainty had ended or how far they
reflected positive confidence in the economic outlook under a new Tory
administration.
Many businessmen expected an immediate burst of consumer spending -
particularly in the south-east - and a few said that it had already started.
Texas Homecare said takings at its chain of DIY stores shot up yesterday to
double the level of recent Fridays.
But many companies also doubted whether a recovery could be sustained
without additional measures to stimulate the economy - above all, a cut in
interest rates.
One of the most optimistic prognoses came from Mr Geoffrey Miller, managing
director of Barclays Banking Divisions, who said: 'We are pretty confident
that a consumer-led recovery will now get under way and the housing market
will be the first sector that benefits.'
Mr Stanley Kalms, chairman of Dixons, the electrical and electronics
retailer, said: 'I am quite sure the result is going to give a very
important fillip to the high street. At last consumers know what the name of
the game is and can make spending assessments.'
Mr Kalms, who threatened before the election to freeze planned investments
worth as much as Pounds 50m if Labour won, said the programme would now go
ahead and would be pitched 'at the upper end of the range'.
In the travel industry, which had viewed a hung parliament as the biggest
threat to business, the mood was also jubilant. 'The election is brilliant
news. A decisive result was fundamentally important,' said Mr Roger Allard,
managing director of Owners Abroad, the second-largest UK travel company.
There were forecasts of a pick-up in advertising. 'Much to do with
advertising and marketing budgets depends on a 'feel-good' factor. One
result of the election is that people in charge of advertising and marketing
budgets are bound to have much greater confidence,' said Mr Mike Walsh,
chairman of Ogilvy &amp; Mather in London.
However, other businesses dependent on consumer spending were more cautious.
Kingfisher, which owns the Woolworth, Comet, B&amp;Q and Superdrug chains,
agreed that the election had removed a cloud over confidence but it added:
'Recoveries are not created by elections.'
Laura Ashley, the fashion and furnishings group, also struck a cautious
note. 'There will be a lot of euphoria around in the next two weeks, but I
think it will be misplaced. Recovery will come, but it won't be very rapid,'
said Mr David Oliver, corporate affairs director.
Mr Michael Jackaman, chairman of Allied-Lyons, the drinks, food and
retailing group, was even more downbeat: 'We were not looking for fireworks
from UK consumer spending before the election and our view hasn't changed.'
The optimists claim the main obstacle to a consumer-led recovery has not
been a lack of money, but of confidence. They argue that political
uncertainty and Labour's tax proposals have delayed purchases by consumers -
particularly those in higher income brackets, who account for a
disproportionate amount of spending. The clearer political outlook should
thus unleash a wave of pent up demand.
More cautious observers do not dispute this but point out that the election
has not resolved deep-seated economic worries, notably fear of unemployment
and high interest rates. They doubt that confidence will remain buoyant for
long while these concerns persist.
Views on interest rates differ widely. Although many banks expect a decline,
Mr Michael Shaw, chief executive of Britannia Building Society, warned
yesterday that it could be slowed by increased competition for savings.
Lower mortgage rates could take several months to work through to the
housing market. 'I think the market will pick up slowly, but buying a house
will never be as easy or cheap again as it is now,' said Mr John Bayliss,
managing director of Abbey National.
In the words of Mr Tim Park, a corporate finance director of Williams
Holdings, which owns conservatory maker Amdega and kitchen supplier
Smallbone: 'It is early days. The economic situation has not changed in the
last 24 hours.'

FT  11 APR 92 / Election 1992: Industry leaders welcome decisive result
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Industrial Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ANXIETY at the prospect of a Labour administration, which reached such a
pitch last week that even some of the Tories' most senior industrial
supporters were resigned to defeat, faded yesterday.
There was also relief that the uncertainty which would have accompanied a
hung parliament had been avoided. In addition, there was a sense of excited
surprise that the Tory win was so convincing.
Sir John Banham, director-general of the Confederation of British Industry,
said: 'Of all the possible outcomes this was the best possible result for
British business.'
Sir Denys Henderson, chairman of Imperial Chemical Industries, said: 'We
welcome the fact there has been a clear result which helps to remove
uncertainty and allows business to plan more constructively in what is still
a very difficult world environment.'
There is a widespread belief in business that the political uncertainty of
the past few months over the timing and outcome of the election had held
back recovery. So will the Tories' decisive win clear the path out of
recession or is it so deep rooted that Britain will remain in depression?
Relief that Labour had not won was based on more than executives' panic
about their personal tax bills. Companies in sectors such as cars, retailing
and construction had feared that a mixture of higher taxes for the better
paid and higher interest rates would have scuppered recovery.
The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders said: 'With the recent
reduction from 10 to 5 per cent in special car tax, followed now by the
removal of political uncertainty, the motor industry looks forward to a
major improvement in new vehicle sales.'
The impact on investment is likely to be mixed. About a third of companies
in the FT-Mori poll of executives conducted during the election said they
would invest less under Labour. But most large companies, such as GKN, the
motor components group, say their investment plans are so long term a change
of government would not have affected them.
The most immediate benefits should come through a restoration of consumer
and business confidence, especially if the Tory victory leads to an interest
rate cut but executives were cautious about how much of an effect this would
have.
Mr Martin Taylor, chief executive of Courtaulds Textiles said: 'There is an
awful lot of middle-class money that has been hoarded in the run up to the
election. There could be a consumer boomlet, which may ignite a recovery.'
The building industry let out a collective sigh of relief.
The Building Employers' Confederation said: 'We were looking for a clear
result rather than anything else. We are going to go on pressing for an
increase in spending by local authorities from council asset sales receipts.
With a clear result and a Conservative win we would hope that people who'd
been holding back on projects would now come forward.'
Mr Ian McAllister, chairman of Ford GB, said the company was holding by its
earlier forecast of a 4 per cent to 7 per cent increase in new-car sales
this year to 1.65m-1.7m.
Yet with much of the rest of Europe facing recession and slower growth in
the Far East, recovery will take more than a Tory win. Business has been so
worried by the threat of Labour's tax plans that it has ignored the risk
that fiscal pressures may force the Tories to consider raising taxes. In
spite of the win, industry will be looking to Mr Major to change the style
of government's approach to business, by offering more direct support,
particularly for exports.
Mr Alan Sugar, chairman of computer group Amstrad, summed up the mood: 'It
is a great victory for good old-fashioned common sense. But the new
government should listen a bit more to what business has to say and the
recovery will depend on much more than a national sigh of relief. Lower
interest rates, low inflation and the encouragement of enterprise through
low taxation are all crucial.

FT  11 APR 92 / Election 1992: EC hopes for a more positive Major
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT MAUTHNER, Diplomatic Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE new British government will be faced with a series of important foreign
policy decisions, some of which have been delayed pending the outcome of the
general election.
Britain's European Community partners hope that the Conservatives' victory
will allow Mr John Major, the prime minister, to adopt a more positive
attitude towards European economic and monetary union than he displayed at
December's negotiations on the Maastricht Treaty. They do not, however,
expect him to alter his refusal to sign the treaty's social provisions.
EC governments expressed relief that the election produced a government with
a clear majority which would provide the Community with a steady hand on the
helm when the UK takes the EC presidency for a six-month period on July 1.
This is considered particularly important given the agenda which the EC has
to deal with during the latter half of this year. Not only are the member
countries striving to get the Maastricht Treaty ratified by the end of the
year, but member states must also complete their single market by January 1
and agree five-year budgetary provisions. In addition they must take
decisions on the enlargement of the community.
Mr Douglas Hurd is widely expected to retain his post as foreign secretary.
Among other urgent difficulties are the British contribution to the United
Nations peace-keeping force in Yugoslavia, measures to reverse Iraq's
decision to deploy anti-aircraft missiles in the protected area of northern
Iraq, and UN sanctions against Libya if Tripoli refuses to extradite two of
its nationals alleged to be responsible for the 1988 Lockerbie bombing.

FT  11 APR 92 / Election 1992: Personal mandate delights Major
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN MAJOR, speaking outside No 10 Downing Street yesterday, described
himself as delighted with the outcome of the general election, and in having
his own mandate.
He said: 'I can now accept that the country has elected me in my own right.'
Asked when the UK would be out of recession, he replied: 'No one can be
precisely sure when we will be out of recession. The final ingredient to
lift us out of recession was our election victory. We can now move forward.'
The prime minister, speaking to reporters and members of the public, said
that many governments facing elections in a recession had lost power. 'We
have bucked that trend,' he declared, 'and we have bucked that trend in the
most spectacular fashion.'
Commenting on the opinion polls during the election campaign, he said, 'They
were wrong, the Conservative party was right.'
It was, he claimed, the result that showed that the British people
understood the realities. 'They understand who is going to get them out of
the recession, who is going to build the recovery.
'They actually want to have more of their money in their pockets, to spend
in their fashion and they want those choices and opportunities that we are
proposing to give them.'
Describing his previous 17 months of office as 'exhilarating', Mr Major
said: 'We have in the next few years the most remarkable opportunities in
front of us in this country. I want to make sure that this country is in the
right position to take advantage of all these opportunities.'
He continued: 'The first thing we must do is to move the country out of a
recession and back into growth, and then we must continue to extend those
opportunities and those choices which make such a difference to people's
lifestyles, such a difference in the way in which they live their everyday
lives free of interferences from outside.'
The prime minister added: 'I want to see those education opportunities that
we have spoken of, the extra training opportunities, the chance for an
ever-increasing number of our fellow citizens to own their own homes, to
build up their own wealth and their own shares, and to have the opportunity
 -in due course  - of making sure that what they have earned in their
lifetime can be handed on to the people they love, and passed on between
generations.
'We do believe, as a party, in the cascade of wealth between generations,
not least with the security and independence that that provides the people.
Mr Major said: 'Let me make it clear beyond a doubt: we shall continue to
build up and cherish the National Health Service.
'It will remain as it is now, it will not be privatised, not now, not at any
stage while I am in Downing Street.
'We will continue to build it up as an NHS available for all the people in
this country in precisely the way it has been in the past.'
Speaking of foreign relations, he said: 'We propose to do all we can to
build up Britain's standing in the world, to play a leading role in the
Group of Seven, in the European Community, in the United Nations and in the
international events in the world.'
Mr Major went on: 'When I first had the opportunity of standing on the steps
of Downing Street, I said that I believed in a nation at ease with itself,
the development of a truly classless society with opportunities for all from
wherever they come, and to do whatever they can with their own lives by
their own efforts and with encouragement to achieve everything that they
can.
'That is the sort of society that my colleagues and I will be working hard
to build in the next few years.'
Asked about the Conservative party's performance in Scotland, Mr Major said
that - in spite of some predictions that the party there would be 'wiped
out' - 'as far as I can see, our votes were up in Scotland, our seats were
up in Scotland and our argument is getting through in Scotland. We will
continue to debate all the constitutional issues in Scotland and take stock
as I promised.'

FT  11 APR 92 / Election 1992: Pollsters face questions over their methods
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN and GARETH SMYTH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE POLLSTERS woke up yesterday morning with some explaining to do.
After a campaign in which Labour had consistently led in poll averages, it
was the worst result since at least 1970 for the chroniclers of the nation's
views and intentions.
'I think it has put market research back a long way,' said Mr Julian Bond,
new-product development director at Research International, which has a
policy of not doing political polling. 'Political pollsters don't get enough
opportunities to analyse their data against actual results.'
Mr Robert Worcester of Mori said on BBC radio: 'We have to go back to the
drawing board.'
After an inquest yesterday afternoon, the readiest explanation was that the
polls provided a reasonably accurate snapshot during the campaign but a late
swing, hinted at by Wednesday's surveys and the Harris/ITN exit poll, had
carried things the Conservatives' way.
'All the signs are there was a late switch,' said Mr Brian Gosschalk of
Mori, noting that the company would get more details from a recall survey of
respondents who had been interviewed throughout the campaign.
Newspaper deadlines precluded Mori from interviewing on the evening before
polling day, as it had done in the three previous elections which it
predicted much more accurately.
Mr Nick Sparrow, managing director of ICM, speculated that the Tories owed
their victory to 'a relatively small number of people walking into polling
booths who voted Tory without a great deal of enthusiasm'.
One explanation put forward by pollsters was that people were unwilling to
say they were voting for financial motives, but would consult their wallets
rather than their consciences in the privacy of the polling booth.
From the beginning of the campaign Tory strategists set out to exploit what
psephologists call 'pocket-book voting'. They succeeded. The simplest
explanation for the result is that voters felt they would be better off
under the Conservatives.
Thursday's NOP/BBC exit poll found nearly two-thirds of voters feared that a
Labour government would increase the basic rate of income tax. The Tories
were 16 points ahead on the economy as a whole.
The Harris/ITN exit poll found that 49 per cent of voters believed they
would be worse off under Labour's 'taxation and benefit policies'. Just
under half (48 per cent) of the crucial C2s, the skilled manual workers,
believed they would be worse off.
Undermining Labour's credibility was crucial for the Conservative strategy.
Voters seemed ready for the message: Harris in a poll in January had found
46 of Liberal Democrat voters and 50 per cent of women believed Labour had
'changed just to win the election'. During the election ministers seized on
every opportunity to pounce when Labour spokesmen hinted at additional
spending commitments. It paid off in the end.
The key slogan of the campaign was simple, but telling: 'You can't trust
Labour.'
After their sub-standard performance, pollsters must be hoping there is no
knock-on effect for the commercial market-research business that is meat and
drink to most of them.
Were clients to conclude that their findings on consumer attitudes to soap
powders were no more accurate than recent poll forecasts, the consequences
might be serious indeed.
The Market Research Society said yesterday that it would hold an inquiry
into the performance of opinion polls during the election.

FT  11 APR 92 / Election 1992: Defeat dawns on opposition that has lost its
rosy glow

<TEXT>
AS THE Champagne corks popped around Conservative Central Office's
neo-Georgian building in Smith Square, dawn rose to beer cans and tears at
Labour's down-at-heel headquarters in Walworth Road.
There, on the steps, Mr Neil Kinnock - dog-tired after the three-hour drive
from his constituency - made his closing remarks of the campaign.
'It is essential that the Labour party retain the vitality and the unity
which it demonstrated in recent years and manifested so well during this
general election campaign, ' he said.
'We are and we will remain the only party capable of offering an alternative
government. . . . We will continue therefore to appeal to the breadth of the
nation; to appeal to its best qualities of generosity and creativity and to
its desire to build economic success and to build fair opportunities.'
Such noble sentiments could not disguise the bitterness he felt nor his
continuing bemusement that that 'breadth of appeal' proved insufficient to
see him to Downing Street.
Before him stood the three audiences he has addressed frequently over the
past three weeks. On the scruffy office terrace were Labour's backroom
workers and the motley crew of showbiz stars who had returned from the wake
in a slick Millbank office block to share in the cruel denouement.
In front of him were the massed media, coralled for the last intrusive
camera shot. And behind them, cut off by a line of police, were the human
flotsam and jetsam of Southwark - the ragged underclass  - whose plight his
campaign had, at least in part, sought both to raise and address.
Yet it was key players of the election who were conspicuous by their
absence: the skilled workers and junior managers of southern England whose
votes deserted once again across the river to the more bourgeois comforts of
Westminster.
It was the failure of these voters to turn out, not the fate of Neil
Kinnock, that is the overriding issue that Labour's strategists must now
confront. 'Hampstead and Highgate voted for us, Basildon voted against,' one
party insider said.
Many party supporters laid much of the blame on the tabloid press. Baroness
Blackstone, warden of Birkbeck College, London, observed that in the last
few days of the campaign, canvassers on the doorsteps had found voters
earning only Pounds 9,000 a year who were convinced they would be hit by a
John Smith budget.
She said: 'Whatever anyone says about the press being ignored, it has the
effect of a drip on a stone.'
That too is only part of the story. Wearing her more contemplative hat as a
founder of the Institute of Public Policy Research, the left-leaning think
tank, the Labour peeress also acknowledged that the Hampstead-Basildon
conundrum was a key factor.
Labour had once again captured the guilty middle-class but it had still
signally failed to make substantial inroads into the C2s and the lower ranks
of middle-management. How to address this perennial question is now at the
heart of Labour's post-mortem.
In the medium term, without a root and branch rethink, the party's fate can
only get worse. Fighting in the worst recession since the war on the most
mild-mannered economic programme ever concocted (pace higher-rate
taxpayers), Labour still lost. It now must face a constituency boundary
reform that will almost certainly cost it another 20-odd seats.
Already yesterday simmering anger in Scotland suggested that a schism north
of the border may not be far off. Although the Scottish nationalists did
poorly on Thursday, they might reap their revenge on Labour in the local
government elections next month, provoking an implosion in the Scottish
Labour party.
Arguing for an all-party anti-Tory alliance in Scotland firebrands such as
Mr George Galloway, returned for Labour in Glasgow Hillhead, were yesterday
talking seriously of non-violent civil disobedience campaigns.
What then are the forces behind a full-blown realignment of the left
nationwide - a Lib-Lab anti-Tory coalition that will concentrate Britain's
political dogfight into something closer to Democrats versus Republicans?
Although this - called only half-jokingly the Popular Front of the Mind -
has long been the dream of many progressive intellectuals, support among
Labour's blue-collar rank and file has always been thin.
It may now grow, but only gradually. There are also obvious Catch 22 factors
that lie behind the idealistic chat. If Mr Paddy Ashdown's price for a deal
is a firm commitment to proportional representation, Labour, though drifting
that way under its own steam, might easily split.
Professor Ben Pimlott, also of Birkbeck College and a founder of the radical
Samizdat magazine, pointed out yesterday that Lib-Lab pacts always favoured
the Liberals. If Mr Ashdown's voters did not feel like obeying a truce, many
of them would simply peel off to the Conservatives. Labour coalitionists had
no alternative port of call. 'A Lib-Lab pact sounds nice and sensible, but
it doesn't look like happening.'
Yet a number of Labour leaders - some from unexpected roots  - are being
forced to contemplate a deal.
Mr David Blunkett, the party's local government spokesman, can hardly be
decribed as a yuppy but yesterday even he was spelling out stark choices. He
said: 'There are only two ways we can get rid of the Tories: by winning a
straight majority or by a pact with the Liberals that apportions seats
between us.'
With the gritty views of a one-time Labour leader of Sheffield, Mr Blunkett
is one of many who believe that the campaign, as in 1987, was too public
image and opinion led. He thinks it was Mr Major's direct approach on such
issues as proportional representation and Scotland in the last few days that
swung the voters behind him.
'Politicians should run campaigns on the lessons they learn from their
surgeries. If you hand it over to professional communicators you lose
something.' Mr Blunkett added: 'Style can never replace straight talking and
high principles.'
That said there were none yesterday who dared argue that the blame lies with
the leader. Most Labour strategists believe that even had the
confidence-inducing Mr John Smith headed the team, the scale of the party's
defeat suggests he could not have crossed the tape in front of the
Conservatives.
Yet by early afternoon it was already clear that - genuine sympathy for Mr
Kinnock aside - the telephone lines of the key players in a future
leadership contest were already buzzing. Few doubt that one will take place,
ending at the Blackpool conference in October.
For the unions, Mr Smith, the sober-suited shadow chancellor, will prove the
obvious safety-first choice. But if he runs there are others who must decide
whether they can make their pitch, if only to put down a marker for future
contests.
Mr Gordon Brown and Mr Tony Blair, the trade and employment spokesmen, have
both been repeatedly tipped as the 'skip a generation' options. Mr Robin
Cook, the PR supporter and shadow health spokesman, has been named as a
figure who could bridge the gap between the left and the constitutional
reforming right.
Mr Bryan Gould, the environment spokesman, could be a dark horse while Mr
John Prescott, the bluntly-spoken leftwinger at transport, could bid for the
blue-collar vote.
Each must reconciled themselves to the fact that this contest will be
different. Personality alone will not decide the race, a credible agenda
must be laid before a party still incredulous at its defeat.
What is more the winner has to devise an answer to the conundrum that Labour
has still not resolved: how a reformist party can successfully win a mandate
from a country that has proved itself, once again, ever more cautiously
conservative.

FT  11 APR 92 / Election 1992: Ashdown blames fear of Labour for Tory swing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WAVERING TORY voters' fears of a Labour government were blamed yesterday by
Mr Paddy Ashdown for turning what could have been a remarkable lift-off for
his Liberal Democrat party into a damage limitation exercise.
The Liberal Democrats, as much as Labour, were victims of a late swing back
to the Tories - apparently only hours before polling began  - and a false
air of optimism they allowed to build among campaign workers.
With opinion polls last weekend putting their support as high as 21 per
cent, strategists had talked of winning up to eight extra seats.
When the last results arrived yesterday, that uplift had evaporated. They
have 20 seats in the new parliament, two fewer than before. The Liberal
Democrats won 18 per cent of the vote, down five percentage points on 1987.
The sense of disappointment, exacerbated by exhaustion, was palpable when Mr
Ashdown addressed party workers in London before heading for his Yeovil
constituency.
'Our vote would have been very substantially higher had it not been for the
fear, the concern, that people had for the prospect of a Labour government,'
Mr Ashdown said.
He also attacked Britain's 'first past the post' system, claiming that the
Liberal Democrats would hold more than 100 seats under proportional
representation and predicted that Labour would have to back electoral reform
before the next election.
Mr Ashdown was initially dismissive of forming an 'anti-Tory' coalition with
Labour but appeared not to rule it out completely.
'It is time for the parties to reflect. I don't think you should go any
further than that,' he said.
Mr Ashdown's private ambition had been to build the Liberal Democrat party
so that it could challenge Labour's claim to be the main alternative to the
Tories. To that extent, Thursday's results were helpful. A question-mark had
been raised over whether Labour could ever be re-elected, Mr Ashdown said
yesterday. But the swing from Liberal Democrat to Labour on Thursday may
dash his hopes.
The Liberal Democrats had a right to feel robbed - at least by the polling
organisations. Their energetic, low-budget campaign, engineered by Mr Des
Wilson, the former director of Shelter, the charity for the homeless, was
regarded as better than both the Labour and Tory campaigns. Mr Ashdown's
frantic dashes across the UK and populist slogans boosted his leadership
ratings.
The Liberal Democrat pledge to increase education spending by putting a
penny on income tax was backed by 78 per cent of voters, according to an NOP
poll.
However, the Liberal Democrats were perhaps more vulnerable than Labour to
voters telling one story to pollsters and then, in the privacy of the
polling booth, voting for the benefit of their pockets.
The Liberal Democrats also lost seats by failing to protect their rear
flank. While good targeting won seats like Devon North, Cornwall North,
Cheltenham and Bath, they lost their celebrated by-election wins of the last
parliament - Eastbourne, Ribble Valley and Kincardine and Deeside.
Ceredigion and Pembroke North and Southport, lost by the Liberal Democrat
incumbents, did not even feature on lists of vulnerable seats.
Nor was there evidence of widespread tactical voting in the swathe of seats
in southern England where the former Alliance parties were the main
challengers in 1987.
Yet Mr Ashdown was able yesterday to argue that the party had established
useful foundations on which to build. Two years ago, as Mr Wilson began to
plan the party's election strategy, support for the Liberal Democrats stood
at single figures in opinion polls. In the 1989 European elections the party
trailed behind the Greens.
Amid the continuing anger and confusion over the merger of the former
Alliance parties, the Liberal Democrats were in danger of political
extinction. Only recently have party officials admitted how close the party
came to bankruptcy. It has finished the 1992 election with a relatively
healthy balance sheet.
Against that backdrop, 20 seats is a solid performance, a reminder to Labour
and the Tories that Britain has not reverted to two-party politics. It looks
poorer largely because of the deliberate expectation-building by Liberal
Democrat strategists, in the last few days of the campaign, in the hope of
starting a bandwagon effect.
Where does the campaign leave Mr Ashdown? Unlike Mr Kinnock there is no
question-mark over his future. He enjoyed the campaign and would probably
like to lead his party into another election. 'It has been tremendous fun,'
he told party workers yesterday.

HARDLINE Afghan guerrilla leaders yesterday rejected UN-brokered plans for a
new ruling council to take power in Afghanistan as the first step towards
ending the 14-year civil war, Reuter reports from Islamabad.
But their host, Pakistan, welcomed the United Nations move to set up the
council and appealed to all Afghans to join the peace process.
UN Secretary-General Mr Boutros Boutros-Ghali announced in Geneva earlier
yesterday that agreement had been reached to set up a 15-member council to
take power from President Najibullah's government in Kabul. The council is
to precede an interim government.
There was no comment from the Kabul government or moderate guerrilla
representatives but hardline guerrilla chiefs condemned the proposal.
'Any government made by any foreign agency will not be tolerated even for a
moment,' main hardline guerrilla leader Gulbuddin Hekmatyar said.
'We completely reject this council,' Ittehad-i-Islami party leader Abdurrab
Rasul Sayyaf and Hezb-i-Islami (Khalis) party leader Younus Khalis said.
They said the Afghan people would not accept any government imposed on them
except one of Mujahideen guerrillas. Sayyaf is the prime minister of a
divided guerrilla government based in Pakistan in which Khalis is the
interior minister.
There was no immediate comment from the rebel government's moderate
President Sibghatullah Mojaddidi, who supports the UN plan.
The ruling Watan (homeland) Party said in Kabul the council would include
former ministers, exiled intellectuals and bureaucrats.
Mr Boutros-Ghali said the council would be composed of impartial
personalities. 'We have reached an agreement in principle to have a
pre-transitional council of 15 members in Kabul which will take power now.
This is the first step of reconciliation,' he said.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SOUTH AFRICA'S President F W de Klerk yesterday declared a historic
breakthrough in relations with Nigeria after a two-day state visit marked by
surprising cordiality.
General Ibrahim Babangida, the Nigerian president, showered Mr de Klerk with
praise during his visit, the first by a South African leader.
He said Mr de Klerk deserved a place alongside the most famous black South
African anti-apartheid fighters: Mr Nelson Mandela, president of the African
National Congress (ANC), Mr Steve Biko, the black consciousness leader who
died in police custody under a previous white government, and Archbishop
Desmond Tutu, the anti-apartheid cleric.
These were extraordinary words from a Nigerian, given the open hostility
which has characterised Nigeria's relations with South Africa for decades.
But Gen Babangida went beyond rhetoric to physical embrace: he grasped Mr de
Klerk's hand and the two men stood swaying to the strains of Nigerian music,
a remarkable demonstration of their new-found reconciliation.
Nigerian officials say President Babangida wants to establish diplomatic
relations with Pretoria and to sponsor South Africa's entry into the
Organisation of African Unity, of which he is currently chairman. This would
be possible only after a multi-racial interim government is established in
South Africa, likely within months.
Reconciliation with South Africa may prove the largest foreign affairs
achievement of President Babangida's career. He is due to hand over to a
civilian government at end of the year.
Both President Babangida and Mr de Klerk repeatedly stressed their joint
vision of a brave new future for Africa built around a Lagos-Pretoria axis
which they hope will give the continent new clout in international
relations.
There were protestations of African brotherhood from both, each eyeing the
economic benefits of closer co-operation. President Babangida said: 'We are
delighted that we have at last found someone in South Africa with whom we
can do business.' Indeed, the real prize of the trip will be normalised
commercial relations between Africa's two superpowers.

<TEXT>
SUPPORT for the German government has fallen to its lowest level for three
years, and anxiety over the flood of asylum-seekers has risen sharply,
according to a poll by the ZDF television station this week, writes
Christopher Parkes in Bonn.
Although support for far-right parties, which made strong gains in state
elections last weekend, has increased, they would be unlikely to win seats
in the federal parliament if an election were held tomorrow.
Almost two-thirds of the sample named asylum as the country's most serious
problem. This was the issue which won the Deutsche Volksunion and the
Republicans their backing last weekend. Latest estimates suggest 400,000

FT  11 APR 92 / PM plans radical reshuffle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN MAJOR will today radically reshape his government in the wake of a
spectacular general election victory which gave him a personal mandate from
the voters and guaranteed the Conservatives an historic fourth term in
office.
As the final results confounded all the predictions of the opinion polls to
give him a 21-seat overall majority, the prime minister prepared to put his
personal stamp on the new administration with a large-scale cabinet
reshuffle.
The Conservative victory celebrations were mirrored by the an agonising
post-mortem by Labour which is expected to lead to Mr Neil Kinnock's
resignation as party leader. Mr Paddy Ashdown blamed a slump in support for
the Liberal Democrats on a last-minute flight of supporters to the
Conservatives because of their fear of a Labour government.
Senior figures on all sides agreed that the key to Mr Major's victory had
been his strong personal standing alongside powerful fears among voters that
Labour's tax and economic policies would hit incomes and prolong the
recession.
Mr Kenneth Baker, home secretary, Mr Tom King, defence secretary, and Mr
Peter Lilley, trade and industry secretary, were among those tipped last
night to be among the casualties of a reshuffle.
Among those likely to be rewarded with a more prominent role were Mr Michael
Heseltine, environment secretary, Mr Kenneth Clarke, education secretary and
Mr David Mellor, chief secretary to the Treasury. Mr Major is expected to
promote a woman to the cabinet, giving the department of employment to Mrs
Gillian Shepherd or Baroness Emily Blatch. There was uncertainty over
whether Mr Norman Lamont would remain as chancellor or whether he would be
offered another senior post at the Home Office or defence.
Mr Major's task was complicated by the defeat in Bath of Mr Chris Patten,
the Conservative party chairman. The prime minister is determined that Mr
Patten - the most senior of eight ministers to lose their seats - should
retain a prominent role in shaping his government's programme.
The reshuffle, which will underline the prime minister's break with Mrs
Margaret Thatcher, will be accompanied by the most radical shake-up of
Whitehall responsibilities since the early 1970s. Two cabinet posts are to
be created, the department of energy abolished and several departments will
see some of their responsibilities transferred. The Treasury will take over
the Trade and Industry Department's responsibility for regulation of the
financial services industry.
Speaking at a victory celebration in Downing Street, Mr Major repeated a
promise, first given when he replaced Mrs Thatcher as party leader, to work
towards the creation of a classless society 'at ease with itself'.

FT  11 APR 92 / House prices may gain from victory
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BARCHARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BANKS and building societies believe the Conservative election victory has
set the stage for a recovery in the housing market in the second half of the
year.
However, a pick-up may take some months to assert itself. Most mortgage
lenders believe any recovery in the second half will simply cancel out the
fall in prices in first half, leaving the market flat at the end of the
year. By next year, the picture could be different as house prices make
further gains.
Halifax Building Society, the largest mortgage lender, said: 'The end of
uncertainty is good news for the market. Confidence should now return, with
a gradual recovery in prices.'
Figures published by Halifax yesterday show that house prices were static
last month after falling 1.2 per cent in January. House prices in the
south-east are now 7.7 per cent below their level of a year ago. Halifax
forecast that prices should be on a rising trend by the year end.
Banks expect a gradual decline in base rates. But Mr Michael Shaw, chief
executive of Britannia Building Society, warned there may be increased
competition for savings, meaning that rates do not fall as quickly as they
might have otherwise done.

FT  11 APR 92 / Markets soar on Tory win
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BILLIONS of pounds poured into UK government bonds yesterday from investors
in Britain and around the world who reacted with relief to news that the
Conservative government had been returned with a clear majority.
Shares, sterling and government bonds all surged yesterday indicating the
belief within financial markets that Mr John Major's return to Downing
Street strengthens the chances of a UK economic recovery.
Mr Major's victory also sparked expectations that the government might soon
cut base rates, now at 10.5 per cent, in a bid to bolster the fragile signs
of an upturn.
However, the Bank of England, in its money-market operations, signalled that
any imminent move to shave borrowing costs was unlikely.
Banks and building societies believe the Conservative election victory has
set the stage for a recovery in the housing market in the second half of the
year.
On the London stock market, the FT-SE 100 index of leading shares leapt by
136.2 to 2,572.6, the biggest one-day rise since October 1987.
UK government bonds - or gilts - closed up to 4 points higher, enabling the
Bank of England to sell up to Pounds 4bn worth of bonds during the day. A
large proportion of these bonds, sales of which help to pay for
public-sector borrowing, were purchased by investors from Japan, the US and
other parts of Europe.
Also fuelling optimism was the overnight rise in the Tokyo stock market,
combined with a firm tone on Wall Street, which bolstered hopes that the
flagging Japanese economy would not materially affect global growth
prospects.
Investors also switched money out of other currencies into sterling, which
rose nearly 3 pfennigs in London at DM2.885. In New York it finished at
DM2.8903.
Mr Paul Chertkow, chief currency analyst at the London office of Citibank,
the US bank, said: 'The election outcome has created a much more favourable
situation for an economic recovery in the UK.'
However, Mr Michael Saunders, UK economist at Salomon Brothers, the US bank,
warned that the weak state of the economy meant that any recovery would be
modest. 'We are unlikely to see the economy steamroller away,' he said.
Yesterday's euphoric mood among investors ended a depressed four-week period
for UK financial markets.
Yesterday's buying support was aided by a resilient tone on Wall Street,
where the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed at 3,255.37, up 30.41.
While sterling was little changed against a stronger dollar, closing in
London at Dollars 1.764 and in New York at Dollars 1.7655, it yesterday
climbed back against the D-Mark to heights last seen consistently in
February. The move took the pound comfortably above its DM2.78 lower limit
in the European exchange rate mechanism.

FT  11 APR 92 / Race for Labour's leadership begins
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY and RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Labour leadership race was under way last night amid feverish behind the
scenes debate about who may replace Mr Neil Kinnock.
Widespread speculation put Mr John Smith as odds-on favourite, but the
shadow chancellor said he would 'wait to see what Mr Kinnock decides' when
the Labour leader makes a statement on his intentions on Monday.
Officials insisted that Mr Kinnock had fought a highly-praised campaign and
might opt to continue in the leadership. But close colleagues were convinced
he would step down in the wake of Thursday's defeat.
'The party is determined that he is not pushed,' one said. 'But the feeling
is that he will not want to go on.' No candidate wishes to be seen as
throwing his or her hat into the ring before Mr Kinnock decides on his
future. There was also public praise for his conduct of the campaign.
However, Labour's unexpected failure to win even a hung parliament after
hopes had been so high has persuaded even Kinnock loyalists that his
position will be contested. Mr Roy Hattersley, deputy leader, is also
expected to step down, but is believed to have delayed his decision so as
not to embarrass the leader.
The expected battle for the succession is thought likely to start almost at
once and not to end until the party's autumn conference in Blackpool. It
threatens to be a serious distraction for the party from next month's local
government elections and could also form the focus of the lengthy
post-mortem into the defeat.
Despite his refusal to comment, supporters of Mr Smith, who is likely to win
the backing of some of the big trade unions, believe he is certain to run.
They also expect he would put his name forward early and hope to avoid a
damaging contest.
This strategy may well be disrupted by the intervention of other candidates.
Among those whose names are the subject of speculation are Mr Robin Cook,
the health spokesman, Mr Gordon Brown, at trade, Mr Bryan Gould, at
environment, Mr John Prescott, at transport, and Mr Tony Blair, at
employment.
Candidates for the leadership must win the backing of at least a fifth of
the parliamentary Labour party. They must then win a majority of an
electoral college comprising 40 per cent unions and 30 per cent each
constituency parties and PLP.
Mr Kinnock said he will make a statement on Monday about the action he
proposes to take.

FT  11 APR 92 / City car bomb kills 2
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS and KEVIN DONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TWO people died and nearly 90 were injured in a car bomb explosion in the
heart of the City last night. One person was critically injured and 14 were
seriously hurt.
A second heavy blast followed within hours when a van bomb exploded at
Staples Corner, injuring one person. The second blast was heard more than
six miles away by emergency services clearing up in the City.
Police said the first bomb, in a car containing more than 100 pounds of high
explosive, had gone off outside the Baltic Exchange in St Mary Axe, close to
the Lloyd's and Commercial Union build-ings.
The blast, which came as City workers celebrated the Conservative election
victory, sent ceilings crashing and glass cascading into the streets as
bleeding and terrified people ran for their lives.
Cdr George Churchill-Coleman, head of the anti-terrorist squad, said early
today that the blast bore indications of being the work of the IRA.
A warning call on the City bomb included an IRA code word. Its reference to
a bomb at the Stock Exchange - half a mile from blast 20 minutes later - was
'designed to delay', he said.
The Baltic Exchange and the Commercial Union headquarters were badly damaged
and police said 'a number of structures have collapsed'.
A maintenance worker on the roof of a nearby building said the billowing
smoke and debris was 'up to the height of the NatWest tower'.
The blast blew out windows in shops and offices up to a quarter of a mile
away. Witnesses reported people injured by flying glass, and one man said
the CU building was 'in tatters'.
The injured were taken to St Bartholomew's, Guys and the Royal London
hospitals.
The explosion left a big crater in the road, reduced the fronts of buildings
to rubble, and collapsed roofs. Glass was piled two inches thick over a
widespread area, police said.
The blast, felt throughout much of central London, was heard by the prime
minster, Mr John Major, in Downing Street as he worked on his new cabinet
appointments.
One witness told Sky TV that a single-decker bus had been 'blown across the
street' by an 'almighty explosion'.
Mr Martin Verrills, an assistant underwriter at Lloyd's, who was in a nearby
public house at the time of the explosion, said there was 'a burning mass
from a car bomb in the middle of the road'.
The City bomb - thought to be one of the biggest planted on the British
mainland - came only hours after Sinn Fein president Gerry Adams lost his
West Belfast parliamentary seat in the election.
A warning about the Staples Corner bomb was received at Portadown in
Northern Ireland at 12.20am.

FT  11 APR 92 / Without benefit of hindsight: Why the Tory campaign was such
a disaster
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DOMINIC LAWSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Note to Editor: Here is my piece for Saturday's FT. I'm afraid I've had to
file on Wednesday: I have pressing financial matters to attend to in the
Cayman Islands and there's only one flight a week. But the polls are
remarkably consistent that there will be a Tory defeat, so this piece should
hold.
SO, as all the pundits predicted, the Conservatives have suffered a crushing
rebuff from the electorate. It is, as the polls forecast so unanimously, the
biggest swing against a party in power since the war.
Now the Tory inquest must begin - although it had begun unofficially over
the past three weeks as it became increasingly clear that John Major's
campaign was running into the sands.
I am not writing with the benefit of hindsight when I say that the
shortcomings of the Tory campaign have not been the result only of poor
presentation. Rather, they reflect a real weakness at the heart of Tory
policy-making. The party has not yet come to terms with the departure of
Margaret Thatcher and is suffering an identity crisis as a result. It had
almost nothing to say about the need to reform the way the country is
governed, even though it is now clear that change was both inevitable and
desirable.
As the electorate has correctly sensed, a healthy democracy requires change
and choice in the character of government. It would have required very
compelling arguments to re-elect any party after 13 years in power: the
Tories looked as if they had run out of steam and needed to re-think their
priorities away from the cares of office.
For all that, the Conservatives might have won this election had they run
the campaign with even half the verve and style of their opponents, both
Labour and Liberal Democrats.
But John Major cannot compete with Neil Kinnock as a platform orator and the
contrast was there for all to see on the television news. Major's attempt to
counter this by standing on a soap-box at every opportunity was a gimmick
which, we can now see, back-fired horribly. It was un-prime ministerial and
undignified. In the purge which will now take place at Conservative Central
Office, the first person to lose his job will be the one who thought-up the
soap-box - that is, if anyone can be found to admit to it.
John Major himself, however, must take much of the blame on to his own
shoulders. The greatest challenge that faces a prime minister is the
loneliest one: the responsibility of choosing when to go to the people.
John Major funked it on two occasions. First, in the immediate aftermath of
the Gulf War. That was when Margaret Thatcher would have dissolved
parliament. Indeed, had Michael Heseltine been elected leader of the
Conservative Party that is what he would have done, too. And either would
have won a khaki election.
Even less forgiveably, Major failed to call a General Election in November,
as many of us advocated, before the full depth of the recession became
evident. That was probably his last chance ahead of the tidal wave of
mortgage re-possessions and business failures which ate into the traditional
Tory bedrock of support in the south-east.
The sad truth is that Major is not quite the asset he once was to the
Tories. There was a time when Central Office regarded him as the
election-winner. His decency and compassion were what would get the Tories
through, even though they were fighting in the middle of a recession. But
the lack-lustre Tory campaign, coupled with the fact that Major, himself, is
not a naturally impressive campaigner, has diminished the Conservative
leader in the public's eye. Kinnock has survived the election unscathed,
indeed enhanced - that is the true measure of just how bad the Tory campaign
has been.
The judgment of history may well be thus: that John Major was elected leader
of the Conservative Party because he was not Margaret Thatcher but failed to
be elected as prime minister for the same reason.
Hope that's OK for this weekend. Should the unimaginable happen and John
Major is returned to Downing Street with a workable overall majority, just
scrap this and run my Easter piece "Humility: An Unfashionable Virtue".
Best. Dominic.

FT  11 APR 92 / The movement that lost its soul: Martin Jacques, former
editor of Marxism Today, on Labour's defeat
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN JACQUES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UNTIL THOSE opinion polls on the eve of the election, I, like many others,
thought Labour would form the next government. It was the first time since
1974 that I have thought this. Ever since the Thatcherite revolution of the
1980s, I have been a pessimist about Labour's chances. The attempts at
renewal always seemed to fall far short of what was needed. History demanded
something special, something profound. What was offered always seemed too
narrow and pragmatic. But this time, I thought, maybe . . . I was wrong.
The reason for Labour's defeat does not lie in this campaign. We have to go
back to that crucial period of the 1980s when the relationship between left
and right was redrawn. Thatcher recognised that the Labour movement was
losing its popular base. She comprehensibly took it on and thereby
transformed the parameters of politics. The reason for her success was a
combination of ideology and material change, not least the decline of the
old working class.
Labour's initial response was in kind: it came under the sway of Tony Benn,
who argued that Labour had lost in 1979 because it had strayed from the
verities of socialism. The 1983 election proved this to be unsustainable.
Along came Neil Kinnock who, in his own pragmatic way, saw that many of the
old socialist nostra now had a distinctly hollow ring. Out went public
ownership, 1970s style interventionism, opposition to the European
Community, and unilateralism. The unions and the producer interests were
consigned to the back seat.
There is no doubt that Kinnock was basically right. The problem, though, was
one of motivation and effect. The changes were driven by electoral
exigencies. One by one, those branches of Labour's tree that were deemed to
be electorally unpopular were lopped off. But these amputations left the
patient lifeless. Labour lost its soul. The process was a product of two
factors: electability and a Thatcherite agenda. In so far as it had
intellectual roots, they belonged in the past: to Croslandite revisionism
and the SDP. There was nothing wrong with that - except that its inspiration
derived from the 1950s or 1960s. In contrast, Thatcherism was much more up
to date. So a momentous change was made without an accompanying revival of
intellectual dynamism or energy. Labour's repositioning was, above all, a
marketing exercise.
The evidence is legion. Labour has sought to convey the impression that it
is pro European. Yet in this election it it failed entirely to talk
seriously about the European issue. It has edged towards a radical position
on the constitution, but only the Liberal Democrats were prepared to argue
the case. As the party which has championed the public sector, Labour has
steadfastly clung to a conservative view of reform in the sector. Here is a
party which, rightly, has begun to see itself as a modernising, European
social-democratic party, but which has not been prepared to come out of its
corner, work out exactly what that means and share it with the electorate.
In a situation where Labour has abandoned its past, and the ground rules of
politics have been transformed by the Thatcherite revolution, that is
utterly inadequate.
Labour now faces a task which is truly monumental. With this victory the
Conservatives are now more than half established as the permanent governing
party. This election was the true test. It is not just the magic figure of
four consecutive victories. Even more important is the fact that the Tories
won after they had made the transition from Thatcherism to something rather
wetter. They themselves provided the country with the political choice. It
will now take something truly historic and momentous to shift them. The era
of pragmatic modernisation, which is how one might describe 'Kinnockery', is
not up to the task.
The Kinnock era provided one crucial point of departure. There can and will
be no return to traditional socialist politics. Those days are over. But the
task of defining a progressive, post-socialist alternative to Conservatism
is clearly only beginning. Electoral reform and the new convergence of the
Liberal Democrats and Labour is one prerequisite. But the problem is not
simply electoral arithmetic, as the extraordinarily resilient Conservative
share of the vote demonstrates. A successful progressive alternative will
need to slice into that vote, not simply bring together those who are
already non-Conservatives.
There is one sense in which this election has been part of the European
landscape. Although Europe was barely mentioned in the campaign and there
was no hint of the fragmentation evident in recent elections in Germany,
France and Italy, these contests all have one thing in common. Everywhere
the left is in trouble. The search for a progressive alternative has an
international dimension.
As I contemplated the results of the election on the morning after, my mind
suddenly flashed back to my time at Marxism Today. I did not realise how
profound and enduring its arguments about the decline of the left, the
novelty of Thatcherism and the characteristics of our time were likely to
prove. They seem as relevant now as when they were first written.

FT  11 APR 92 / Private View: The man who discovered Japan Inc - Professor
James Abegglen has spent 40 years in a country he believes the West
misunderstands
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTIAN TYLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN THE shambling bear of Soviet Communism lost his claws, Americans found
a new bogeyman in Japan. Their fear of a Kremlin plot to conquer by force of
arms was replaced by fear of a Japanese conspiracy to achieve world economic
domination.
One of the first people to alert the world to Japan's post-war success story
was Professor James Abegglen, the American son of a Swiss cheesemaker from
Riplinger, Wisconsin. Abegglen is the man who invented the phrase 'Japan
Inc', and who gave the Japanese a word for their system of lifetime
employment: shushinkoyo.
As a US marine he fought on Guam and Iwo Jima and was twice wounded. Later
he joined the team that surveyed the bomb damage in Hiroshima. Ten years
after the war, armed with a Chicago PhD in social anthropology and a Harvard
diploma in Japanese, he went back.
He has lived there ever since. He is married, for the second time, to a
Japanese wife, Hiroko; they have a small flat in Tokyo and a big seafront
house in a picturesque fishing village on Chiba Bay.
A young and humorous 66, Abegglen claims to be the first westerner to make a
serious study ofJapanese industrial organisation after the war, thus may be
considered the doyen of management consultants in his field.
So, on one of his flying visits to London, I asked him whether Americans -
or any of us  - were right to fear the Japanese.
'At a micro level' (this is how management consultants talk) 'you could say
that to the extent Japan succeeded in automobiles and the US failed, someone
has lost a job. It's not surprising that as the US senses its diminished
position in the world, it casts about for a scapegoat.
'But in any ultimate sense, of course, no. The enormous economic success of
the US was not at the expense of Europe. Economics isn't a zero-sum game.'
Abegglen's thesis is that the West, encouraged by the rhetoric of ignorant
Washington politicians, has invented a cunning Oriental demon to explain
away Japan's startling success. We have made a mystery where there is none.
But what about the unfair trading practices which have been identified over
the years? I asked.
'No, I'm sorry. It's all very well to say the Japanese cheated on this or
that, but everyone does. The US is protectionist in its way. I've no doubt
that Britain has its own little protectionist games, too. In the last decade
or so the Japanese economy is as open to trade and investment as any - and
in some ways more open.'
Did Japan succeed in spite of protectionism, or because of it?
'One has to be careful not to get too sweeping about these things. Every
nation has always had to protect infant industries. Until the late 1960s
Japan was the most closed economy in the world. But as it reached a certain
degree of competence, size, scale and efficiency, it opened. Had it not
opened it would not have become as powerful as it is now. 'In the US we had
enormous amounts of protection through the 19th century. As we took off, we
opened up - in our own interests. It wasn't because we were nice fellows.'
So what do people mean by 'Japan Inc.', then?
'I rather wish I could take that phrase back. As I used it originally I was
trying to convey the sense of a quite homogeneous society where there was
competition between divisions but a common financial policy. It seemed
useful at that time. to describe Japan as a kind of super-conglomerate.
'Unfortunately, because the term turned out to be very catchy, it came to
mean conspiratorial Japan - some bearded gentleman at the console of a
computer, that kind of thing. And that of course was never the case.'
But whole books have been written about their industrialists' secret
cartels, I said.
'You know, I think we should really face a couple of things. Japan's success
has had no historical precedent. That in itself is very hard for us to get
used to. The other is that it came from Asia, and Asians are not supposed to
be industrially rich. Emotionally, we in the West find this very, very hard
to deal with.
'That leads us to say it must have been done by cheating. But I don't think
we have any sense how long Japan was working at it - its industrial efforts
go back to the 1870s. Also, I suppose, we took for granted that we have some
commanding position in technology and income levels. Americans think they
have some God-given right to be the richest.'
The professor agreed, however, that the Japanese contribute to foreigners'
suspicion by their own responses. 'In trade negotiations, instead of telling
the Americans to go to hell, they always try to give ground. The Americans
take that as a sign there's something there, and ask for more.'
Do none of the racial stereotypes have any truth? What about their
reputation for conformism?
'Certainly Japan has eccentrics - though perhaps quite not to the British
degree. I mean one thinks of the extraordinary achievements in drama,
poetry, design. One has to be careful. If I describe the Japanese as a bit
more group-focussed, family-oriented, more prone to identify with the
company, that's a fact, a sociological fact. But I'm not saying that they
all conform.
'I suppose the fact they are very far away, that they all look alike to us,
has a great deal to do with it. We like simplicity. It's nice to say, well,
they're a bunch of conformists, they all march together. Surely we're aware
that if that were the case they would not have so successful a society.'
What about the common allegation that they can't invent?
'Well, it's not true. I think we're past that. You say they can't invent but
they have the Noh Theatre, the Kabuki Theatre.'
That's pretty stylised and traditional.
'Someone had to invent it.'
But it hasn't changed since 1300 or something.
'Yet we find that in Paris Japanese designers are high fashion. They have
great architects, Nobel prizewinning novelists. How can we still insist
there's no originality?'
'But they do have a talent for picking up other people's ideas, don't they?
'Yes, I would say that. And simultaneously preserving their system. But the
first stage of development is always copying, as you know.'
Why, asked the professor, were we so reluctant to give the Japanese the
credit for what they had done?
'Here are people who came out of extraordinary destruction and defeat. They
do not trade in weapons. They do not contribute to these ghastly wars that
man is engaging in. They do not impose their values on other nations by
seeking to change governments. They mind their own business and are now the
largest suppliers of aid in the world.
'Why is it that we have to view them as an enemy and try to say they don't
really succeed in technology - that they just change the colour from fuchsia
to chartreuse and slap a patent on?'
What is your answer to that?
'In the first place, I don't think the Japanese are terribly comfortable
people - not very relaxed or casual. They don't have quite the ease of
humour: they're a bit towards the German end of the spectrum. They don't
blend easily with others which makes them, I think, a little harder to
handle. But I say again, we find the speed and magnitude of Japanese success
terribly threatening.'
Prof Abegglen can easily sound like a mere apologist. So I asked him: Have
you gone native?
He laughed. 'I don't feel I have.'
But perhaps your analysis is mistrusted?
'Well, that happens. Certainly I'm accused of being an apologist because I
disagree with some of the more hostile cliches about Japan. But I still have
major international companies as clients. They don't see me as a patsy.'
If Japan had an institutional weakness, he said, it was its political
immaturity: 'There isn't the political leadership to take care of things
like reducing the working week.'
Is their success threatened by the young becoming westernised?
'That's a tricky area. Heavens, I don't understand my own children so I
don't profess to understand young Japanese either. If one of my
stepdaughters - I have two lovely Japanese stepdaughters  - wears blue jeans
instead of kimono has she changed her basic values? Or is she simply
consuming differently?
'My own sense is that the values have changed rather slowly. One doesn't see
signs of increased criminal activity, for example, or dropouts from school.
People worry about it, but the incidence isn't going up.'
Abegglen is unapologetic admirer of Japanese companies' ability to combine
intense commercial competition with egalitarian and humane employment
policies.
'When they compete they compete hard. It's not a marshmallow roast. But the
grotesque compensation paid in the US to chief executive officers would be
unthinkable in Japan.
'Their system is very attractive and it produces marvellous results. They
have gone further than any in the world to deal with people in a decent
fashion. In the US, we throw people away.'
Westerners should not make the mistake of seeing the Japanese as ten feet
tall, he concluded.
'We focus on the massive successes, the two huge engines that drive the
economy - electronics and autos. But I will give you a parallel list in
which Japanese companies have no distinction whatsoever: they have no
aerospace industry to speak of, their chemical industry is fragmented,
petroleum refining is a disaster both technologically and financially . . .
There's a long list.'
The forces slowing Japan down were already visible: the population was
ageing, which would lead to a decline in savings. That would affect
investment and labour supply. Growth would slow to 2 or 3 per cent a year,
normal for a mature economy.
'But by the time that happens,' said Professor Abegglen with a smile, 'the
Japanese will be by far the richest people on earth.'

ELECTION Day. It is 1.45pm in Westminster North and I am scuttling round to
the polling station to cast my vote and help usher in an era of civilised,
consensual, coalition governance in these weary, wracked isles. I am also
hoping for proportional representation, Pounds 1bn more on education, faster
trains, better food, brighter newspapers, cleaner cinemas, smaller telephone
bills and a dramatic uplift in the price of gold.
Yes, I am voting for Wing-Commander Paddy Ashdown and his valiant Liberal
Democrats. The only blot on the landscape, the only fly in the pie, is the
knowledge that my vote for liberty, fraternity and Wing-Commander Ashdown
will be neutralised and ground to dust by the vote of Miss Lee, my executive
assistant, a hardline Thatcherite.
I saw her just a moment ago, wearing a lot of Jaeger. 'Good afternoon, Miss
Lee', I said. 'Off to vote for five years more of Tory Terror? Another four
nuclear subs? Tax breaks for stag hunts?'
I have to be careful how I goad her. If I overstep the mark she shuts
herself in her office and rings her 24-hour emergency gardener. Among the
Jaeger mob in Kensington and Notting Hill, 24-hour emergency gardeners are
very much the thing. All are tall and hirsute. I believe they have mobile
phones.
2.55pm. I have now walked about half-a-mile west, to the Portobello Road, so
have crossed the constituency boundary between Westminster North and
Kensington. The Tory MP in Kensington is Dudley Fishburn. The Tory MP in
Westminster North is an even nicer man, the unbelievably industrious Sir
John Wheeler. Pity he's got to go.
I am shopping for cauliflowers. Also a duck. This is Rasta territory, though
there is scant sign of the brothers, or of election fever. I can hear about
17 languages. I buy a cauliflower. Also an 8 lbs duck. I return to my own
constituency. Miss Lee is not impressed. She is wearing her afternoon
jewellery. 'That is not a cauliflower', she says, 'and that is not a duck.
We shall have to dine out this evening.'
6pm. On the Six O'Clock News, Anna Ford tells us that a high election
turnout is expected, and shows us pictures of the three leaders voting in
their constituencies. The Wing-Commander looks jubilant.
8.15pm. I and Miss Lee walk to Queensway to dine. It must be the most
cosmopolitan street in Britain: a mixture of Cairo, Marseilles and Mazatlan.
Quirkily, it sets me thinking about the ozone layer and the rainforests, the
Japanese stockmarket crash and the great wind machine of international
finance, refugees and immigration - in short, the sort of issues that were
virtually ignored during the election campaign because the media (not the
politicians) were lazily obsessed with cranking out stories about minute
fluctuations in the opinion polls, as though anyone apart from the pollsters
and pundits cared more than a paragraph's worth about such claptrap.
10.55pm. Not much action yet, though the TV channels are manufacturing vast
clouds of nonsense based on the projected swings shown by . . . exit polls.
11.45pm. On BBC1, David Dimbleby declares that a long night looms.
Friday, 1am. I stroll to Porchester Hall, hoping to attend the count for
Westminster North. The door is blocked by police. 'Where's your yellow
ticket?' a constable asks. 'You should have applied for a yellow ticket four
weeks ago. We cannot let you in, Sir. Those are our instructions. We are
only carrying them out.'
2.57am. 'John Wheeler holds Westminster N' flashes across the bottom of my
TV screen. The Tories look home and dry, which means I'll have to wait a few
more years for faster trains, better food, brighter newspapers, cleaner
cinemas and smaller telephone bills. God knows what the gold price is doing.
5.28am. Neil Kinnock makes a dignified and moving speech outside Labour
party headquarters which ought to haunt those who voted for a few extra
grubby pounds in their pay packets.
7.15am: Miss Lee sweeps into the room where I am eating a lonely breakfast.
She is dressed entirely in Chanel. There are emeralds all about her. Her
skin glows like silk. 'I expect you journalists will want to be at your
typing-stations pretty smartish this morning', she says. 'Most of you have
spent months writing drivel. You'll want to find some stories, want to get
back to news.'

FT  11 APR 92 / Entertainment: Workshop crowded with disciples - The
Rembrandt exhibition
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICIA MORISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR ALL the intense critical reaction excited by Rembrandt: The Master And
His Workshop, now at the National Gallery, one key issue has hardly been
mentioned: what did it mean to be a pupil in Rembrandt's workshop? And yet
this relationship of master to pupil is a crucial element in the debate,
over a century old, over what Rembrandt did or did not paint.
In addition to the marvellous display of paintings undoubtedly by Rembrandt,
the exhibition's second agenda is to show paintings securely ascribed to 11
of the master's associates: Jan Lievens, Frans Bols, Flink, Carel Fabritius,
Jan Victors, and so on - plus, in each case, one painting hitherto given to
Rembrandt.
The unattributing is, of course, the work of the notorious Rembrandt
Research Project. The Dutch government funds the RRP to the tune of Pounds
50,000 per annum, with additional sponsorship on the scientific side coming
from DMS, the Dutch chemical company. (A modest cost for an enterprise which
can wipe millions off the value of paintings as widely loved as the Frick
Collection's Polish Rider.)
For a highly critical account of the RRP's methodology, I recommend Simon
Schama's review in the Times Literary Supplement last March 20. With that
honourable exception, critical comment on the RRP has been a mixture of
parti-pris and arrogance.
Reaction to the proposed reattributions falls into two categories. Some
spring to the defence of a painting like The Vision of Daniel, raging
against the RRP like a 17th-century Dutch mother whose daughter's virtue had
been slighted. Then there are the triumphalists, shocked that weak-eyed
curators and connoisseurs could ever have imagined Rembrandt painting the
feeble Apostle Thomas (which, they fail to observe, is terribly damaged) or
the garish Feast of Esther.
Instead of all the howling and crowing, it is more rewarding to get one's
mind round The Master and His Workshop. Is it plausible that so many pupils,
for a time at least, painted so thoroughly in the manner of their
astonishingly various master?
I believe it is. For one thing, 'pupil' is a tricky word because it tempts
us to under-rate these artists. It was said that Rembrandt always had
children de bonne famille studying with him, and that he sold their work.
Presumably he only accepted pupils with talent - easy, in an age of amazing
precocity: Jan Lievens, Rembrandt's associate, set up in business when he
was 12.
Pupils, or disciples as they were also called, still accepted the medieval
view that they must sink their artistic identity in the master's. Today's
society, obsessed with individuality, find such a relationship hard to
grasp.
Another difficulty is the fashionable comment that Rembrandt ran a 'factory'
where artists laboured over canvases which Rembrandt, arch-capitalist and
unsuccessful stock-market speculator, signed to keep the business off the
rocks. But how many anachronistic assumptions underly this picture]
The atmosphere in the workshop must have been fiercely competitive, and the
young artists no doubt dreamed of the day when they would (and did) take the
bread from their task-master's mouth. Did emulation or affection inspire the
many portraits of Rembrandt, subsequently often labelled self-portraits?
Think of Frans Hals, each night taken home roaring drunk by pupils,
undressed, and tucked up in bed. Probably the pupils felt pride and
cameraderie in belonging to Rembrandt's gang.
Modern research shows Rembrandt as a pretty rough character, but that does
not necessarily give us leave to smirk because his signature appeared on
pupils' work. Le Corbusier did exactly the same. Contemporary collectors
listed both Rembrandts and copies in their inventories, suggesting they were
bought as separate items. It seems quite plausible that Rembrandt told
clients, 'An Oriental head by me is pricey, but one by a top pupil with my
signature comes cheaper.'
Unlike Rubens or Van Dyck, it seems that Rembrandt almost never let
assistants work with him on a painting, in which case a painting was either
the master's or it wasn't. Furthermore, the Amsterdam art-market was
regulated. When a Jewish customer complained that a portrait looked unlike
the sitter, asking Rembrandt either to repaint or repay back the fee, the
dispute was laid before the Guild of St Luke. Would Rembrandt have risked
scandal by selling workshop paintings as his own when the work of his
talented pupils fetched a good price?
The pity of the current show is that the selection of work by the other
artists is too small. Many will not realise that good, even terrific,
paintings by 'mere' pupils hang in abundance in our public collections.
Carel Fabritius's self-portrait merits its place among the Rembrandts
hanging upstairs. The young Jan Lievens was a superb painter. I, for one, am
very fond of Bols's drummerboy in Rotterdam, and Aart Van de Gelder's
glowing paintings of Esther.
Van de Gelder - sadly not in the exhibition  - was the only pupil who stuck
to a Rembrandtesque style once it became unfashionable. Young women, as
Nicholas Maes noted, disliked all the brown in Rembrandt. The very fact that
Maes and Co. adapted so swiftly to fashion presupposes an age of artistic
chameleons, as quick to change out of Rembrandt browns as into them.
Recently a critic wrote that the idea of Gerrit Dou painting Anna and Tobit
is 'only marginally more sensible than to argue that Walt Disney painted the
Sistine ceiling.' And yet, later paintings such as the well-loved Quack
Doctor mark Dou as a brilliant artist of the Golden Age. Dou, earliest of
Rembrandt's pupils, soaks up his finely detailed manner of the 'thirties,
and surpasses himself with this haunting scene. Is it such an incredible
scenario?
A splendid spin-off from the RRP would be a major exhibition of paintings by
Rembrandt's best pupils, separating the sheep from the sheep, so to speak.
If Drost painted the Wallace Collection's atmospheric Unmerciful Servant and
The Polish Rider, then he is indeed an intensely interesting artist.
I am not saying the RRP's judgment is 100 per cent correct. But at least the
team's views are based on scrutiny of an enormous number of paintings. I
rate them higher than the petulance of critics. When it comes to
narrow-mindedness, who is more at fault: art-historians supposedly obsessed
with 'narrow taxonomies,' or sentimental status quo-ites unwilling to
consider a different view of Rembrandt?

FT  11 APR 92 / Entertainment: A mean old man without a mummy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TANITCH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CAPTAIN James Hook made his first entrance at the Duke of York's Theatre,
London, on the December 23 1904, in Peter Pan, and Freudians have been
hooked ever since. Steven Spielberg's film fantasy, Hook, is a reworking of
this instant children's classic and Dustin Hoffman becomes the latest in a
long line of actors who have played the pirate chief.
Hook is a parody of a stage villain: part blood-curdling, lip-smacking
relation of Robert Louis Stevenson's Long John Silver; part highly educated,
cigar-smoking scoundrel in a Victorian melodrama; part Shakespearian ham
(shades of Macbeth and Richard III); part Restoration fop with his
extraordinary oaths ("Split-me-infinitives]' and 'No, bicarbonate of
soda]'); and part music-hall comedian in his double-act with Smee.
Barrie, whose stage directions are nearly as long as the play proper, says
this about him: 'Cadaverous and blackavised, his hair dressed in long curls
which look like black candles about to melt, his eyes blue as the
forget-me-not and of a profound insensibility, save when he claws, at which
time a red spot appears in them. He has an iron hook instead of a right
hand, and it is with this he claws.
'He is never more sinister than when he is being polite, and the eloquence
of his diction, the distinction of his demeanour, show him to be of a
different class from his crew, a solitary among uncultured companions. This
courtliness impresses even his victims on the high seas, who note that he
always says 'Sorry' when prodding them along the plank.'
The role was created by Gerald du Maurier whose daughter, Daphne, has left a
vivid picture of her father:
'When Hook first paced his quarter-deck in the year 1904, children were
carried screaming from the stalls, and even big boys of 12 were known to
reach for their mother's hand in the friendly shelter of the boxes. How he
was hated, with his flourish, his poses, his dreaded diabolical smile] That
ashen face, those blood-red lips, the long, dank, greasy curls; the sardonic
laugh, the maniacal scream, the appalling courtesy of his gestures; and that
above all most terrible of movements when he descended the stairs and with
slow, most merciless cunning poured the poison into Peter's glass.
Du Maurier set the precedent for doubling Hook and Mr Darling. But then, of
course, Hook is Mr Darling in disguise, and his death is the Darling
children's Oedipal revenge for his trying to 'poison' Nana, the dog, with
the medicine he was too cowardly to take. Hook ends up inside the ticking
crocodile. Mr Darling ends up in the dog-house (literally). When Sir George
Curzon played both roles, some critics were persuaded that Hook was really
much the more pleasant man.
Ernest Thesiger asked Barrie to give him a hint on the characterisation.
'Always remember', he said, 'that the Captain was educated at Balliol.' The
Captain was also educated at Eton and politically he was a Conservative.
Barrie was not keen for Charles Laughton to play Hook, fearing that Hook
might turn into Bligh and frighten the children. So anxious was Laughton not
to offend that he went to the other extreme. 'This is a portly rounded
pirate,' said The Times, 'with whom it would be pleasant to dine at ease
after a morning's murder and a little plank-walking with afternoon tea.'
The play, a mixture of romantic fantasy, gooey sentiment, Edwardian
spectacle, patriotism and religion, has been kept alive by generations of
parents, rather than by their children. The Spielberg epic (a tribute to
mother-love and a kick in the teeth for workaholic dads who neglect their
kids) will also appeal to grown-ups, especially when spunky little Wendy
dismisses Hook as a 'mean old man without a mummy]'

SO THE people have decided.
They want a bumper Ministry of Culture, encompassing the arts, heritage,
broadcasting, sport and tourism. One of the lesser ironies of the election
campaign was that the Conservatives were offering the radical reform of the
arts industry, with a seat in the cabinet for the new supremo.
Of course this totally reverses the Tories' recent practice in office, when
the arts minister has been a politician whose career has peaked, and who is
seeking a soothing run down towards retirement.
But if the Conservative manifesto commitment is taken seriously, what does
it mean for the arts?
Well, at a stroke, running the extended arts brief becomes an important job,
attractive to a politician on the up. If he is sensible, David Mellor - who
had an enjoyably revolutionary few weeks in the job in 1990 - would return
to the department, where he could make his name reorganising broadcasting,
introducing the lottery, planning the Millennium celebrations, and generally
becoming as popular (and as reviled) as Jack Lang, the celebrated French
cultural minister.
Another name in the frame is John Patten. But the arts would also provide a
comfortably soft post for the token woman in John Major's new cabinet -
perhaps Virginia Bottomley who, after all, is known in her constituency as
Mary Poppins.
It seems likely that the current arts minister, Tim Renton, will give up the
job. He seemed to sense as much before the election, when he stirred things
dramatically by tearing up the enshrined arms-length principle, and
suggesting that the Arts Council's control over funding for the big national
companies like the Royal Opera House at Covent Garden, and the Royal
National Theatre, should be taken over by the minister.
The Conservative victory will worry the Arts Council, which has slimmed down
greatly in the past year as it hands over funding responsibilities to the
regional arts boards. The Arts Council sees its role as the advocate for the
arts and the paymaster of regional touring and the big national companies.
But the Conservatives have pledged a review - and it could be reviewed out
of existence.

ANOTHER outcome that was awaited, though with only moderate eagerness, on
election night was that of the second Donatella Flick Conducting
Competition, being concluded at the Queen Elizabeth Hall.
Ms Flick, who is a wealthy Italian patroness of the arts, has given backing
to productions at English National Opera; last year she turned her
attentions to tyro British conductors. The prize is Pounds 5,000 worth of
specialist study in Italy.
I suspect that conducting competitions, like all the other musical
competitions with which we seem to be plague-ridden, do more harm than good;
demoralising the losers, inflating the winner, and suggesting that the
spiritual art of making music is a sport like any other. Conducting
competitions are more disconcerting than other kinds: the mystique and
authority considered indispensable to the conductor are readily exposed as
sham when everyone is having a go at having them, and there is no very solid
basis for purely technical evaluation of candidates.
Of course real authority and charisma are bound to come through, even in
these artifical and gladiatorial conditions, but the two evenings of the
Flick finals yielded little in this regard. The four contestants were chosen
on their CVs and references, and each was allocated half a concert and an
afternoon rehearsal slot.
Each conducted a Mozart concert aria (soprano Tinuke Olafimihan) and a
middling length piece, and had to give an unrehearsed reading of the last
few minutes of Bartok's Dance Suite. The orchestra was Young Musicians'
Symphony - the largest I have ever heard in this hall.
I found all the Mozart arias disappointing. Each began with a spasm of bad
intonation; none quite found its stylistic way. But they are testing to
perform at the best of times, and these were the worst.
Far more successful were the Romantic items. Graham Jackson (who alone
conducted from memory) directed a well-paced, interestingly detailed account
of Sibelius's Karelia Suite; altogether he gave evidence of solid, if not
electrifying, ability. Ian Hughes did a decent job with Rimsky-Korsakov's
Spanish Capriccio, and Andrew Dunscombe offered up a fair Romeo and Juliet
fantasy-overture.
Timothy Lole instilled passion and vibrant musicianship into the performance
of Elgar's In The South. It was decidedly impressive, and he deserved his
prize.

SHAW'S Pygmalion reads and looks so like the plot for a musical that, with
hindsight, it is remarkable that more than 40 years elapsed before the
emergence of My Fair Lady. No modern audience can now see the play without
being reminded of the lyrics and probably coming to the conclusion that the
musical is better than the original.
The new production at the Royal National Theatre does not seek to conceal
those facts; it would be foolish to try. Instead it makes a virtue of them:
here is the piece that led to an even greater success in different form and
an invitation to see why.
The attempt is about 90 per cent successful, which is high praise given the
odds against. Oddly enough, Howard Davies' direction is at its weakest when
it seeks to dwell on Pygmalion as some kind of Hollywood ballet, with Eliza
Doolittle drifting through the streets of London, the music playing in the
background, the scenery moving and the lights flickering. One might say the
same about the ball scene.
There is a period early in the second act when there is virtually no
dialogue. However heroic William Dudley's designs and Mark Henderson's - and
both are on the grand scale - this contrasts strangely with what has gone
before.
For Pygmalion, above all, is a play about words and language. That is why
Shaw wrote it and why even the musical depends on having such good lyrics,
some of the lines being taken almost literally from the original play text.
For at least 10 minutes I thought that the production had gone seriously off
the rails before dialogue returned.
And return it does. Pygmalion has a very good plot, with excellent parts all
round. There may be reservations nowadays about Eliza's father, Alfred, just
as there are about Captain Shotover in Shaw's Heartbreak House, which is
currently playing at the Haymarket. When Alfred seeks to make the
distinction between the deserving and the undeserving poor and to moralise
about the role of the middle class, there is a little too much of Shaw the
paradoxical thinker rather than Shaw the brilliant playwright. This element
has not worn well. Although there is nothing wrong with Michael Bryant's
playing of the part, he would be happier in the musical with some of the
lines cut.
One of the smaller parts that is superbly played is Alison Fiske's Mrs
Pearce, the housekeeper. She has a wonderfully indispensable role in the
Wimpole street bachelor house. Watch her putting Eliza in the bath - a
marvellous vignette in itself. It is a great pity that the part disappears
as the play goes on.
Gillian Barge also shows how much can be made of Mrs Higgins, mother of
Henry. She is a formidable lady with all Lady Bracknell's presence, but
without her intolerance.
Alan Howard, as Henry Higgins, is her very boyish son. He is the professor
who never grows up. She knows that; he knows it too, and in the end Eliza
comes to realise it as well. He is a clever, self-indulgent child with the
bachelor habits of premature middle age.
Howard understands the part through and through. Robin Bailey as the older
Colonel Pickering is the perfect foil, and rightly does not attempt more
than that.
That leaves Eliza. Curiously, it is rather a straight part. We know where
she comes from and where she goes. All she has to do is deliver - but the
play would fall if she put a foot wrong. Frances Barber never does. As the
play closes, she radiates self-confidence - both as Eliza and as Frances
Barber.

<TEXT>
WITH ABOUT half its nationwide tour behind it, Opera 80 is well into its
stride. There are two operas on offer this spring, and on Thursday the
company gave the audience at Brighton's Theatre Royal a Don Giovanni full of
vigour and passion which should fairly completely have taken everybody's
mind off the political drama unfolding during the course of that evening.
It might not have been so. There has been a tendency, in recent years, for
productions of this opera to make great play of the political issues raised
by this many-faceted masterpiece, at the expense of the rest.
We saw one side of that in the recent Royal Opera production. Don Giovanni -
it told us in no uncertain fashion  - is a serious affair. The action took
place in sets of unremitting gloom, as the lights went out on many of the
opera's sensual attractions and all its comedy.
In this production (well designed for touring, by Lez Brotherston) there is
still a lot of low-lit activity; but it is a nocturnal drama shot through
with many shafts of lighter wit and warmer human feelings. Stephen Medcalf,
Opera 80's director of productions, has done the company proud in delivering
a staging which is true to traditional ideas about the opera, while having
an energy that is entirely fresh and invigorating.
No apology is made for the fact that sexual drive is at the heart of what
Don Giovanni is all about. And rightly so, when Mozart's perceptions on that
subject are not at all old-fashioned even in the 20th century.
It is one of those evenings when everybody knows his or her place in the
drama, even if vocal standards are up and down at times. Michael John
Pearson is a Leporello who has learned plenty, from watching his master at
work, about how to be a charmer. Lisa Tyrrell sings an attractive Zerlina.
The soprano Fiona Cameron, strong and steady of voice, makes a dignified
Donna Anna.
An innovation on Thursday (to be followed at three other venues on the tour)
was the provision of a running commentary in sign language for the hard of
hearing. At the speed at which a lot of this performance went, under Paul
McGrath, it was a heroic job for the interpreter just to keep up. Plenty of
life, then, all round - more, arguably, than in the Royal Opera's staging;
far more than in Opera Factory's recent lacklustre showing. London audiences
could do worse than to catch this Don Giovanni when it comes to Sadler's
Wells in May.
The other opera on tour is Albert Herring, which also has a generally
commendable cast. Richard Edgar-Wilson is the nervy Albert, still hanging on
mum's apron strings. Susan Gorton gives a remarkable impression of Peggy
Mount trying to outdo Margaret Rutherford in the role of Miss Pike. Penelope
Chalmers is suitably dragon-like as the manic, bald Lady Billows, who lives
inside a perspex cage.
But wait a moment. Bald? Living in a perspex cage? Yes: unfortunately this
is one of those productions which got impossibly carried away with its own
ingenuity, and has ended up turning people who are caricatures anyway into
grotesque Spitting Image-like puppet versions of their real selves. The
comedy has turned into farce. The satire has become vicious hyperbole.
Benjamin Britten, the composer, would certainly not have been amused, and I
fear that not many in the audience were either, to judge from the
disappointingly low laughter level.
But there was one delightful coincidence. Brighton was lucky enough to see
this Albert Herring on April 10, the very day when Lady Billows and her
fellow village worthies meet to elect a Queen of the May: a satirical
observation, perhaps, on election week.
Opera 80 is on tour in England. It will play two weeks at Sadler's Wells
Theatre, London, from May 19 to 30 (Box Office 071-278-8916)

FT  11 APR 92 / Arts: Trio too cute in tinsel
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IS THERE life after Bananarama? Well, yes and no; more a kind of purgatory,
with a deep dread that things might get worse. Siobhan Fahey was responsible
for a third of the outrages of Bananarama, the manufactured all-girl trio
which gave the public what they wanted to hear and the critics what they
wanted to tear apart.
Fed up with stealing sweets from children, she teamed up with Marcella
Detroit, a substantial songwriter in every sense, to form Shakespear's
Sister. The jokey name (note the dropping of the final 'e') says it all, as
did the empty stage at the Town and Country - empty apart from multi-tonnes
of hardware, which confronted the packed audience for many tedious minutes
before the girls leapt on to it, wearing the kind of tinselly jump suits
that you thought had disappeared with Sweet.
There is nothing much wrong with Shakespear's Sister - dammit, they have a
heavy selling single in 'Stay' - which a little objectivity would not cure.
They are just too consciously cute, Fahey larking about the stage like an
ingenue auditioning for 'That's Life.' But their management has been able to
afford a very professional back-up band - not least the guitarist, a louche
youth who looks incredulous when Fahey lies down, hammering her heels into
the stage, over-excited by his performance.
So it is just a show, with the music a bit Poppy, a bit punky, a bit
pretentious. The unique selling proposition is the strong voices of the duo,
plus their white-faced girls-on-top look. It is all rather reminiscent of
1970s Poly rock. The best songs were the more soulful, like 'Heaven is in
Your Heartbeat,' which seems at odds with the relentless clowning.
Superficially, Shakespear's Sister are fine, but there is enough talent on
offer to produce an enduring class act. Perhaps success has come too easy,
too soon.

</HEADLINE>

   By B A YOUNG
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PLOT of Ostrovsky's play, written in 1850 and censored on the Tsar's
orders, runs fundamentally like this: to hoodwink his creditors, the wealthy
merchant Bolshov makes over most of his assets to his clerk Lazar and goes
bankrupt. The scheme is that he can settle his debts at some trivial rate,
and Lazar with then return the property. To ensure Lazar's loyalty, Bolshov
marries him to his daughter Lipochka, although a matchmaker has already
found her a husband more to her taste.
Lazar has learnt much from his master, however. He is content see him
languish in a debtor's gaol, rather than return his property; and Lipochka
has used all the ill-gotten wealth to buy herself into a society as good as
whatever she may have missed.
Nick Dear's adaptation goes easy on Ostrovsky's financial complexities, but
emphasises the comedy and the sex, much of which is his own addition. The
result is a very funny play, but without such condemnation of the merchant
class as led to the original ban, and this is a pity. The dishonesty is
taken as a joke, and pages of the admirable programme are given over to the
comic affairs of the Guinness takeover, the Clowes swindle, and the Robert
Maxwell pensions affair.
Director Martin Houghton is clearly more on Dear's side that Ostrovsky's.
The self-conscious excess of dirty words may have come from the adapter, and
there is frequent public coupling, in more detail than one is used to in
this kind of theatre. (The only two out of a cast of eight that I never saw
at it were Bolshov and his wife.) Like the merchant's ill-dealing, this is
presented with no sign of disapproval.
Mark Chatterton's Lazar graduates from simple clerkdom to a sublime
self-satisfaction that he learned from Robin Polley's Bolshov without
incorporating the built-in bad temper. Sharon Muircroft's Lipochka is a
blonde career-girl, very much of our day rather than Ostrovsky's; and there
is delightful work from Tina Jones as the match-maker and John Fleming as a
drinking solicitor. The costumes and decor by Nettie Edwardsare as
effectively between periods as Dear's script.

FT  11 APR 92 / Arts: In debt to Russia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE CAUSE could not be better, more deserving of support, or nearer to the
hearts of ballet and opera lovers. The Mariinsky Theatre, that most
beautiful of lyric houses, needs help in these times of renewal. A
performance by members of the theatre's opera and ballet troupes, by its
orchestra, and by the students of the Vaganova Academy which shapes the
future dancers for the Petersburg ballet, must tell something of the debt we
owe to Russian dance and music. Hence Thursday night's gala at Covent
Garden, London, under the inelegant title 'Welcome back St. Petersburg.'
Galas, by their charitable nature - generosity from artists as from patrons
 -defy criticism. It would be idle, though, to pretend that all was quite
for the best in aid of the best of all possible theatres. As an omen, the
programme book provided a photograph that would have us believe that the
Mariinsky Theatre is externally blue, instead of that pale and mysterious
Petersburg green, and there are errors in the text which suggest hurried
editing.
The evening comprised in the main arias from operas by Tchaikovsky,
Rimsky-Korsakov, Musorgsky, Rakhmaninov, plus four larger sections (the end
of Prince Igor's first act; the Kromy forest scene from Boris; the Streltsy
scene from Khovanshchina; the Epilogue from Prokofiev's War and Peace), and
some balletic 'gems from the classics'.
The result was over-generous - and with a running time of four hours, a tax
on enthusiasm. With less, but more extended, contributions - the ballet
looked distinctly under par on the terms of fly-by-night virtuosity - the
evening would have been a truer, more flattering portrait of the lyric arts
in St. Petersburg. The Vaganova school students - very young, limbs still
delicate  - were proud upholders of their academy's traditions in the
children's polonaise and mazurka from Paquita: they showed dancing already
nuanced, elegant.
The overwhelming merit of the evening came from those elements which were
most truly themselves: the orchestra and the opera chorus. The opening
orchestral item - the Introduction and dances from Tchaikovsky's The
Sorceress - proclaimed, yet again, the magnificence of the Mariinsky
musicians, with supremely sensitive strings, and Valery Gergiev led playing
of passionate involvement.
The chorus was no less splendid. In the closing moments of the Streltsy
scene, tears must have been near many eyes as we heard the voice of Russia
plain: noble, glorious. And in the epilogue to War and Peace, the hymn of
thanksgiving for deliverance had a renewed relevance for Russia and for all
of us who love that great country, and acknowledge our profound debt to its
arts.
In an introduction to the evening, Sir Peter Ustinov recalled telling a
Moscow crowd that 'we have much to learn from each other.' What we have to
give - and benefactors please note  - is practical support, as one would to
a dear friend. We cannot do less for a theatre and its artists who so
enriched our lives.

FT  11 APR 92 / Arts: A twisting road west - Sergey Leiferkus
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAX LOPPERT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'IT HAS nothing to do with glasnost or the political changes in Russia -
nothing]'. Sergey Leiferkus underlines his point with an amiable rap on the
table, his brilliant blue eyes flashing friendly fire. We are tracing the
twists and turns of a career launched in the West in 1982 which has made him
the singer from eastern Europe most regularly seen and heard by British
audiences since the war.
It has been an extraordinary career, for which he gives thanks entirely to
fate. Not quite ten years ago Leiferkus arrived from Leningrad to take the
leading male role in Massenet's Griselidis at the Wexford Festival. Next
Tuesday he does the same in the new Royal Opera production of Prokofiev's
Fiery Angel. In between his Irish Massenet and Covent Garden Prokofiev there
have been an unprecedented number of engagements on the stages of the
British Isles.
The Coliseum performances were, of course, sung in English; his accented but
clear and highly expressive use of the language only added to the eclat of
his performances. Covent Garden saw him first during the 1987 London visit
of the Kirov; the house's own 1989 new Trovatore production followed, and
Prince Igor the following year.
Leningrad reverted to the name St Petersburg, and the Kirov that of
Maryinsky. While maintaining his close connections with both, Leiferkus
sings throughout Europe and America. He has bought himself a house near
Oxford, and delights in the 'family atmosphere' of British artistic
institutions; he tells people, with relish, that he 'lives in a village,
Iffley, on an island, Britain'.
How did it happen? It was his good fortune to acquire an English agent,
Robert Slotover, of Allied Artists, via a recommendation from the celebrated
Russian bass Yevgeny Nesterenko; luck also attracted the attention of
Wexford's artistic director, Elaine Padmore, a talent scout of renown. But
it was those qualities immediately sensed in Leiferkus's Griselidis Marquis
that must have encouraged other British houses to persevere with him.
It was true that the flow of Russian singers to British houses never
entirely ceased even during the iciest periods of Cold War hostility. But
often those singers, once arrived, looked and sounded out of place, with
vocal and physical gestures that proclaimed entirely different - and
apparently unmalleable - traditions of operatic rhetoric.
Nature and education had already prepared Leiferkus for a different sort of
encounter. Though finding himself initially ill-equipped for Western life
and Western artistic practices he was ready to embrace both. For one thing,
he had learned English at school; and from his youthful days at the Maly
Theatre (now grandiosely re-named the National Theatre of St Petersburg) he
had worked up an appetite for many varieties of operatic idioms and
stage-styles - not just the heavy naturalism practised at the Kirov and
Bolshoy.
He needed it. His first British show was the Scottish Opera Don Giovanni
production by Graham Vick that soon became notorious for, among other
things, the scene in which Giovanni, a gangster in sharp suit and fedora,
dunks Masetto's head in an onstage lavatory bowl. 'I really loved that
production. I miss it. It was so clever, so alive in its presentation of the
characters and the relationships'. He enjoyed no less the chance offered by
David Pountney's ENO Carmen, set in a car-wreckers' yard, to play Escamillo
with Elvis Presley hairdo, leather jacket and swagger; and he speaks with
the born stage-animal's close interest in detail of the unforeseen physical
demands required of his Scarpia by Opera North's Tosca, moved forward to
Puccini's own time.
In the 'school' (as he calls it) of Western production Leiferkus has
developed into one of the world's most remarkable singing-actors: a
chameleon of medium size and compact build who seems to grow in inches when
playing noble leaders such as Prince Igor or swell with just the right
degree of hauteur for Onegin; the secondary figures in his repertory tend to
develop a weight of impact unrelated to the time they spend on stage.
But in the end, the supreme distinguishing attribute of the great
singing-actor is the voice itself. Leiferkus's lean, dark-toned baritone,
mettled for the heavier assignments like Wagner's Telramund and Verdi's Iago
as well as for Mozart and Tchaikovsky, is an instrument of wide compass and
wonderful but rather undemonstrative beauty. Lacking the rich lustre of the
younger Russian Hvorostovsky and the Italianate vibrancy of Vladimir
Chernov, his Maryinsky colleague, he tends to make his points through that
specially subtle, eloquent musicianship afforded by expert vocal technique.
After a recent New York Queen of Spades concert performance Andrew Porter
was moved to remark (in the New Yorker) that in '(Leiferkus's) command of
every vocal resource . . . the great days of Imperial Russian singing seem
to return'. Yet he is oddly dismissive of his voice - 'I don't really like
it, the timbre is never quite what I expect'. While quietly confident of his
suitability to Onegin (which he has sung more than any other), he responds
to criticisms of his Italian enunciation with a modesty that is refreshing.
Like all artists of his calibre he is continually absorbed in niceties of
style, in the need to offer more than peacock vocal displays. For that
reason, too, he is anxious that the durably valuable features of Russian
opera should not be abandoned amid all the turmoil of change. Whether on the
operatic stage or the concert platform he reveals himself as belonging to
that most elevated species of international performers - the singing-actor
with a strong national identity and unbounded artistic horizons.
Fiery Angel plays at Covent Garden from April 14 to May 2).

THE RUSSIAN GIRL by Kingsley Amis Hutchinson, Pounds 14.99, 296 pages
ANNA DANILOVA is a Russian poet, arrived in Britain to campaign for the
release of her brother, imprisoned during the last days of the Soviet Union.
She encounters Richard Vaizey, professor of Russian at the London 'School of
Slavonic Studies', and they fall in love. There are complications: Vaizey is
married, to the beautiful, rich but impossible Cordelia; Anna is not a
particularly distinguished poet, in fact she is a very bad one, and it turns
out that her brother is behind bars probably because he deserves to be. When
Vaizey finally signs the petition for his release, he does so in the
knowledge that his academic reputation will be damaged.
The Russian Girl is a thin affair, with its clutch of interwoven themes
buried in prose that is too often clotted and uneven. One wades through
pages of opaque narrative, tripping over the sentence construction, in the
hope of the odd jewelled one-liner, an attack on a familiar Amis target
(overbearing women, vulgar pretension, ill-educated youth) or the occasional
more extended passage when the writing comes into sharp focus.
Those moments of lucidity underline the uncertainty of the rest. Just before
all the loose ends are tied up, before Cordelia is allowed her petty revenge
and Anna and Richard, poorer but happy, can go off into the sunset together,
there is a short exchange between Vaizey and Cordelia's first husband,
Godfrey. He did not leave her, he tells Richard, 'Until I was satisfied as I
was ever going to be that I had a substantial right to bring about the
tremendous emotional upheaval of breaking up my marriage by walking out on
my wife . . . You need the thought of a proper right. Rage and hate and fear
get you through at the time. But they don't last for ever. Nothing can.
Except remorse. Just now and then.'
At such moments the cynicism and detachment fall away, and Amis reveals how
much he cares about his characters, about the pain they inflict upon each
other, the hopeless messes they make out of their conflicting loyalties;
cares about them in ways that the brittle, jokey surfaces mask all too
effectively. At heart he is an old softy. Even the monstrous, wretched
Cordelia, whose affected accent Amis parodies in cruel streams of phonetic
dialogue, gets her moments of compassion, the hints that beneath the
manipulations and the snobbery is someone far more vulnerable than her
husband ever realises.
The odd crude caricature aside, it is not particularly a misogynist tract -
far less paranoid about women's power and men's powerlessness than, for
instance, Stanley and the Women - though Amis generally maintains his wary
distance. The Russian girl herself comes over as not much more than a
cypher, merely the passport to a new life for Vaizey, and freedom from his
academic obligations and domestic snares. Anna is attractive enough, good in
bed; there are enough samples of her verse for its awfulness to be credible.
But she just materialises out of nowhere with her story of Communist
injustice, the answer to a trapped man's prayers.

MY LIFE IN POLITICS by Willy Brandt Hamish Hamilton, Pounds 20, 498 pages
WILLY BRANDT is one of the three great statesmen of postwar Europe. The
others are Konrad Adenauer and Charles de Gaulle, to whom Brandt pays
tribute - although more to the Frenchman than his fellow German. All three
saw the Franco-German relationship as crucial to European peace.
Where Brandt differed is that he came of working class origins and belonged
to the democratic left almost from the start. No one should underestimate
the tribulations of Adenauer and de Gaulle, but Brandt probably had a harder
life, as full of downs as ups, and sometimes vilified by his own people. He
survived, to develop the fruits of their labours and to make decisive
contributions of his own.
It is typical of the man that he has produced a somewhat rambling political
life. He notes that it is 'simpler to write a book alone than with dozen
other people'. That is what he seems to have done. My Life in Politics is
Brandt writing personally rather than another Brandt Report. The book jumps
all over the place, starting with the crises in postwar Berlin, reverting to
childhood, moving to his role in government, then covering his remarkably
long political after-life following his resignation as Federal Chancellor in
1974.
Yet the theme of a peaceful Germany in harmony with its neighbours is never
far away. Brandt's aim was no less than that, and probably no more. German
unification would never have come about so quickly without the emergence of
Gorbachev. But Brandt's policy of 'small steps' helped clear the way, as did
the policies of Adenauer and de Gaulle before him. In these memoirs it is
impossible not to detect a perceived continuity.
Adenauer saw his task as the first federal chancellor in cementing relations
with the west and making Germany respectable. He told Brandt that the Soviet
Union would not be able to stand up to pressures from both China and the
west indefinitely: therefore changes in eastern Europe might come
eventually. De Gaulle pondered movement east of the Elbe before most Germans
seriously began to contemplate it. Brandt salutes him: 'He had ventured to
think Utopian thoughts of a permanently peaceful Europe . . . In his
perceptions, he came closer to a whole Europe than any of those who wanted
to adapt too fast and too permanently to the postwar landscape.'
What most people outside failed to understand was how firm relations between
Bonn and Paris had become. That was particularly true of the British. Brandt
tells how George Brown, as foreign secretary, said: 'Willy, you must get us
into Europe, so we can take the lead.' He admits that 'in common with
leading British politicians' he did not see Britain as an essential part of
Europe except in times of war. It was France that mattered.
So did Poland. While Adenauer thought that Europe stopped at the Elbe and
drew the curtains at Magdeburg 'so he did not have to see the steppes of
Asia', Brandt believed that the same historical rank had to be given to
reconciliation between Germans and Poles as between Germans and French. That
was one of his great achievements as chancellor.
Brandt attaches special importance to place. He thinks that Adenauer was
governed by being a Rhinelander and considered himself 'more a west German
than simply a German.' Coming from Lubeck and spending his formative years
in voluntary exile in Scandinavia, Brandt was subject to different
influences. That affected both his view of Germany and social democracy: he
regrets that he has not been given enough credit for his role as a reforming
chancellor in domestic policy - following the Swedish model.
We should not take the geographical influence too far. Helmut Schmidt came
from nearby Hamburg, and did not have the same views on social democracy.
Brandt says that the difference there was one of temperament; both Brandt
and Schmidt at times must have both been prickly to work with.
There is a bitter chapter on Brandt's resignation as chancellor after the
discovery of an east German spy on his personal staff. He writes now that he
should never have gone. That does not accord with his mood of the time, when
he seemed exhausted. It is also odd that he should poke fun at Ludwig Erhard
for having asked, as economics minister, how much it would cost to buy East
Germany from the Russians. After all, that is nearly what happened in the
end.

FT  11 APR 92 / Books: This royal throne of myth - A L Rowse takes the Poet
Laureate to task for his view of Shakespeare
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By A L ROWSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHAKESPEARE AND THE GODDESS OF COMPLETE BEING by Ted Hughes Faber &amp; Faber
Pounds 18.99, 517 pages
THE Poet Laureate's book stems from two sources, he tells us: 'The first of
these was my sustained interest in the mythologies and folklores of the
world, which had long preceded my interest in poetry and had in a way led me
to poetry.'
The second arose from an 'old notion of the last fifteen plays, hugely
shuffled and re-arranged to make a perpetuum mobile maze of metamorphic
episodes, play dissolving into play, characters going through their
transformations, in and out of each other's worlds, like supernatural, dying
and resurrected in a real myth.'
So we have been warned: we are dealing with a mythical Shakespeare. The
author admits engagingly, 'in the end, of course, all this is speculation',
and that 'almost anything can be projected into Shakespeare'. He therefore
proceeds to project it, for more than 500 pages.
He is concerned only with the last 15 plays, with the notion of turning them
into facets of one myth, as it might be one long Indian epic.
He informs us that Myth predominates over Plot - as it does with him, if not
with Shakespeare. This is, as he says,'always setting the histories aside.'
But the real world of history occupies more than a third of the Plays, and
Shakespeare was the most historically minded of dramatists, concerned to
depict the real world as well as an imaginative (rather than a mythical)
one.
All these later works, we are told, go back to the two early narrative poems
and the myths that are supposed to lie behind them. 'The myth behind Venus
and Adonis operated as the 'myth' of Catholicism, while the myth behind
Lucrece operated as that of Puritanism.'
Venus and Adonis is to be regarded as a 'shamanic initiation dream.'
Shakespeare is a shaman - as Hitler and Stalin were; caught in the
'crucible' of the Elizabethan age, he was also a 'salamander.' This is a
poetic idea, if hardly recognisable to common sense.
What this leads to reads sometimes absurdly. It is well known that
Shakespeare, as a country man, was 'sportive,' addicted to country sports.
The poem includes a realistic depiction of hare-coursing. What this becomes
in this reduction of everything to myth is the following:
'The hare, in all mythologies and spontaneous dream life, is the mystic
animal of the menstrual cycle, the self-sacrificial victim and divinity of
the womb's ritual of reproduction, the moon's own magical love creature, in
oestrus, passive, appealing.'
After this anything may happen, or become anything else - and it does. We
are told that, 'reincarnating Wriothesley (ie Southampton) as Adonis, he
reincarnates himself as Venus. Shakespeare has identified himself, that is,
at what was evidently a most inflammable moment of his life, with the Great
Goddess of Love possessed by a hopeless passion for Adonis/Wriothesley.'
I do not like to call this nonsense, but it is the exact opposite of what
Shakespeare himself tells us. He says that Nature 'by addition me of thee
defeated / By adding one thing to my purpose nothing.'
All would be well if the effeminate-looking young man were indeed a woman,
but he has a prick, which is nothing to William's purpose. Hence 'since she
pricked thee out for women's pleasure / Mine be thy love, and thy love's use
their treasure.' Let the women have him - Shakespeare's hopeless passion was
for his dark young mistress; everything in his work, as in his life, shows
that he was a heterosexual family man.
As for his relations with his young patron, John Donne at the time knew what
the situation was. 'And they who write to Lords rewards to get - / Are they
not like singers at doors for meat?' Others have noticed that not very kind
comment; but it is the truth about the matter - Shakespeare needed the young
patron for support during those plague years.
There is a similar inversion of sense when we come to All's Well that Ends
Well. Hughes views it autobiographically: no objection to that, except that
again he gets it wrong. Young Count Bertram is reluctant to marry (like
Southampton), flings off abroad (like Southampton), shows courage in
fighting there (as Southampton did in Ireland); Shakespeare is obviously
recalling the young patron's record. Hughes would see Shakespeare as young
Bertram] - ludicrous: nobody else would.
To understand Shakespeare one needs a good, sound commonsense knowledge of
the time he lived in. To Hughes, it was 'a supernova moment, which, it
seems, can happen only once in a nation, as in a star. And while the Red
Giant swelled towards the ultimate explosion, disintegration and collapse,
Shakespeare's dramas incarnated the chemistry of the whole process.'
Celtic exaggeration is the idiom of the book: 'explosions' occur frequently,
the myth of the Boar - 'that holiest of Celtic beasts'  - a hundred times,
Mythic and Tragic Equations a couple of hundred.
Better to get the facts right. Burghley was not a patron of poets, as
Spenser found to his cost. Archbishop Whitgift was not a Puritan but their
greatest enemy. 'Confidence' was precisely what Elizabeth I did not have in
Raleigh.
And so on. But what is the use in the stratosphere? What we need is
down-to-earth facts and evidences, interpreted by Elizabethan scholarship,
for common sense about Shakespeare.

THE GONNE-YEATS LETTERS 1893-1938 edited by Anna MacBride White and A Norman
Jeffare Hutchinson, Pounds 25, 544 pages
ON January 30 1889 a young nationalist, tall, imposing and said to be the
most beautiful woman in Ireland, descended from a hansom cab to visit the
home of the painter John Butler Yeats. His son, the aspiring poet Willie,
opened the door, and what he called the troubling of his life began: Yeats
fell instantly in love.
For 14 years, he pursued Maud Gonne; he proposed to her, worked with her,
wrote obsessively to and about her. She was a radical inspired to
nationalism after seeing Dublin tenants evicted by absentee landlords. He
was a dreamy aesthete. Their meeting ground was Celtic mysticism and Irish
literature, and Maud agreed to a 'mystical marriage.'
Yeats pressed for a material one, kept aloof from other women, believed she
would marry no one. Then, about to give a lecture in 1903, he received a
letter, addressed in the familiar hand, telling him that she had married an
Irish militant, Major John MacBride, in Paris. 'The ears being deafened, the
sight of the eyes blind/With lightning', he staggered through the lecture
and set about reconstructing his life.
The letters about her marriage are among nearly 400 from Maud to Yeats
collected in this compelling volume; only a handful of his to her survived
the ransacking of her Dublin home by Free Staters. Yeats once said his
meeting with Maud Gonne reverberated through his life like a Burmese gong in
the middle of a tent. Here, for the first time, is extensive evidence of
Maud's side of the relationship which has beguiled scholars for half a
century; her life told in her own voice.
Was she a frigid goddess, a manipulative politician, or simply a woman who
could not make up her mind? This correspondence unravels rather the story of
two absolutists set for head-on collision. 'For the honour of our country,
the world must recognise you one of the Great Poets of the century', she
writes. But fanaticism came to colour her reactions - Dreyfus is 'an
uninteresting Jew', later, Hitler was her hope of revenge on England - while
Yeats turned from the struggle to criticise her 'joyous and self-forgetting
condition of political hate'.
What these highly-charged letters make clear is that Gonne lost herself in
politics as she never could in love, and that Yeats' refusal to grasp this
led to the anguished hope and near breakdown that ruined his youth. Maud,
her firebrand letters full of an unswerving interest in the event of the
moment, whether upsetting Queen Victoria's visit to Ireland or extricating
herself from Holloway Prison, never understood her effect on Yeats.
When his patron Lady Gregory asked her intentions, she snapped that she and
Yeats had more important things to think about than marriage. Later, she
claimed her liaison with MacBride was engineered to disguise as a Spanish
honeymoon his attempt to assassinate Edward VII in Gibraltar. But MacBride
got too drunk to carry it out, and after a year of inebriated marriage she
sued her unruly rebel-husband for divorce: 'Of a hero I had made, nothing
remains, and the disillusion has been cruel.'
Yeats met her honesty with generosity, support, advice over solicitors. Hope
surged: in 1916, when MacBride was executed in the Easter Rising, Yeats is
still proposing marriage. Did they ever sleep together? Maud, according to
Yeats and others, had 'a dread of physical love,' and tried to limit sex to
procreation (after her first child died, she descended with her lover, a
French revolutionary, to his tomb to conceive another baby in whom the first
would be reincarnated).
Yeats said he and Maud were briefly lovers in 1908; in her letters then she
dreams of him as a serpent but is most passionate in asceticism: 'My loved
one I belong to you more in this renunciation than if I came to you in sin.
Did you not say yourself that our love must be holy?'
Every one of her letters confirms a temperament uncompromised, too strong in
its beliefs to change. For decades Yeats met her romanticism with his own,
but finally he snatched happiness for himself and married a younger woman.
They rented Maud's house while she was in prison; on her return, Yeats,
fearful for his pregnant bride, turned her away at the door - he knew his
loyalties. But they stayed friends, and she appears in his last poems,
written when both were in their 70s. In
In our century, only another Irish muse, James Joyce's wife Nora, was as
significant in literary history. It is inconceivable that Yeats would have
written the same poetry had he not met Maud Gonne; if she had wanted him, he
even wrote, 'I might have thrown poor words away/And been content to live'.
A classic story: the introspective poet rejected by a beautiful heroine for
a man of action. It makes a book thrilling in itself and invaluable as a
commentary on so autobiographical a poet.

FT  11 APR 92 / Property: The kind of retirement Granny might get a grip on
 -A look at some attractive homes for the elderly
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GERALD CADOGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ARE ALL retirement homes just handy places for 'granny dumping,' as they say
in the US? Or are some nice enough to live in yourself one day?
This section of the property business is a growth industry. By the year 2000
a quarter of the UK population will be ageing baby boomers, 55 years old and
over - and an increasing burden on our children.
In Mediterranean countries granny always has a place. But how shall we cope
in northern Europe and the US when we would seem to have jettisoned family
support systems? Retirement housing projects, especially for families with
no spare room to turn into a granny flat, offer one answer.
Look hard for the good schemes, says Henry Thornton of Beechcroft
Developments, which builds retirement homes, and 'do not leave it too late.'
Shed your furniture yourself rather than have your heirs squabble over it,
and move into a retirement home while you can still adjust easily and are
fit enough to enjoy spending any money released by selling your old house.
Retirement homes are not nursing homes, but they do usually have help on
call 24 hours a day. Their aim is for residents to keep their independence,
but to make life easier by reducing hassle and anxiety at a reasonable cost.
(The good schemes make their profit out of the development, not from the
subsequent management charge).
You have only to press the personal alarm you wear and the secretary (in
Beechcroft's term - more usually 'the warden') will come at once, ready to
call doctor, ambulance or police. Or the warden will look in if nobody has
seen you for a day or two. In practice, crisis calls are few, but all
schemes stress this part of the package for its peace of mind.
Security is also built quietly into the design of good schemes. Viewer
entryphones on the door are normal. Access from outside is restricted to one
entrance; the 'cottages' and apartments are often built round a courtyard,
rather like an Oxbridge college, or, Beechcroft says, 'taking the idea of
living cheek by jowl in smart terraces in the city into the country and
market towns.'
You can usually expect about 20 to 40 units, each with with two or three
bedrooms, allowing couples to sleep apart or have guests and grandchildren.
Award-winning firms such as Beechcroft (0491-34975) and English Courtyard
(071-937-4511) pride themselves on stylish design, sympathetic to the local
townscape. They emphasise the comfort that familiar designs and finish in a
building can bring to people of any age.
Beechcroft's Upper Brook Hill scheme in Woodstock, Oxfordshire (architects:
Andrews Downie and Partners) offers the stonework and solidity of the 18th
century merchant houses in the town, and is well stocked with shrubs. It is
a useful urban renewal project. Views are over the Glyme Valley and the park
of Blenheim; the scheme is barely five minutes' walk from the middle of
town.
English Courtyard's Malthouse Court in Towcester, Northamptonshire (by
Sidell Gibson Partnership), illustrated in the Prince of Wales's book A
Vision of Britain, also reflects local style, using Hornton stone from the
quarries near Banbury.
Once inside any decent retirement home, you should look for unobtrusive
helpful details. Doors should be wide enough to take a wheelchair; stairs
should be fitted with a chair lift. Power points at knee height mean that no
resident has to bend down too far. However, installing your own washing
machine may be better than a communal laundry. (If there is one, inquire how
the rota works - you do not want to be restricted to two fixed hours a
week.)
Every unit should have a garage. If you wish to garden, you will be
encouraged, but there will frequently be a gardener/odd job man to look
after the place, put out the dustbins and clean the windows. Some schemes
even offer a tennis court and a covered swimming pool - like Beechcroft's
new projects at Alton in Hampshire and Cerne Abbas in Dorset. Cerne also has
a nine-acre garden by the river, and is built around a splendid flint tithe
barn.
Check that you are allowed to keep dogs and cats. The human residents are
unlikely to be a problem - many are likely to be congenial fellow readers of
Weekend FT. But location will be important. Do you want to live in a
village, or an old market town equipped with reasonable shops, banks and
doctors? How do you get away? Is it easy for London and the airports?
(Retirement homes are ideal to lock up and leave for a spell in the sun.)
Are there trains, or must your relations ferry you around? Most important of
all, how close do you want to be to them - and they to you? It all adds up
to rethinking your life, prospects, assets, and expectations of your
dependents.
Now is a good time to buy a retirement home; prices have fallen in the
recession. Beechcroft has a cottage for Pounds 147,000 in its Woodstock
scheme, and an apartment for Pounds 127,500. At Cerne, properties will be
between Pounds 95,000 and Pounds 225,000.
English Courtyard's price range for its Earls Manor Court at Winterbourne
Earls, near Salisbury, Wiltshire, which will be ready in the autumn, is
Pounds 160,000 to Pounds 210,000. You do not buy a freehold, but a long
lease: English Courtyard's is 150 years; Beechcroft's is 999 years. An
occupier must be at least 55 or 60, but ownership is unrestricted - it could
be your children or a family trust.
Thereafter, some firms charge ground rent; the better schemes do not. All
have a system for managing the whole property, with an annual service charge
(perhaps Pounds 1,200) to cover building insurance, secretary, gardener,
pool and so on. (You would have had to pay something similar in your old
house, anyway.)
You must pay your own community charge or its replacement, contents
insurance, electricity and water, and interior decoration - though in a new
scheme, if you show interest early enough, you may be able to choose the
colours at no extra cost.
The main hitch at the moment is selling your old property. But if you can
find a buyer, remember that even in today's market, good-quality retirement
housing does well at resale, often keeping its value in real terms. And if
that does not concern you personally, your heirs will certainly be glad to
know.

Tory victory will lift the market but cost still calls the shots
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL HANSON

<TEXT>
NOW THE outcome of the election is known, the uncertainty and inactivity in
the property market should begin to evaporate, with housebuyers starting to
appear again over the Easter weekend. However, many sellers whose properties
have been on the market for some time are expected to review their asking
prices to achieve a quick sale.
Andrew Hay, of Knight Frank and Rutley, expects a surge of properties to
come on to the market as vendors who had hung on until the election come
under pressure from their banks to reduce their borrowings. He thinks
property prices have bottomed out, or are close to doing so. 'But if the
banks cause large volumes of property to be released too suddenly, values
will fall dramatically,' he warns.
Anticipating a Labour victory, several sales took place before the election.
Property developer Ian Pollard, of Flaxyard, sold Hazlebury Manor, his Grade
I listed Elizabethan mansion in Wiltshire, for more than Pounds 2m to a
Dutch businessman who will now be selling his 35-acre Garinish Island, off
the south-west coast of Ireland.
Peter de Savary, who has just put his Devon country home, Waddeton Court, on
the market for sale at Pounds 2.3m with 152 acres of land, is expected to
review the asking price of Littlecote, his Grade I listed Elizabethan
mansion in Wiltshire, which has been on the market quietly for 18 months. He
paid Sir Seton Wills Pounds 7.5m for Littlecote in 1985 but he will be lucky
to get Pounds 6m for it now.
Janet Holmes a Court, widow of the Australian tycoon Robert Holmes a Court,
may have to review the Pounds 17.5m asking price for her magnificently
restored Grove House in Regent's Park, London, once the headquarters of the
Nuffield Foundation, which has been on the market since January.
At this level of the market, much depends on the continued confidence of
overseas buyers. Only a week ago, for example, Knight Frank and Rutley,
acting jointly with Debenham Tewson and Chinnocks, completed the sale of
Brook House in Park Lane to a consortium of overseas investors for Pounds
9.1m. The building, which was MEPC's headquarters, has planning permission
for redevelopment as 17 luxury flats.
Peter Braithwaite, a director of Debenham Tewson and Chinnocks, expects the
steady stream of overseas buyers to continue because London is seen to be a
safe place and prices are low, though he would not be surprised if some
buyers hang back waiting for prices to drift even lower.
'We held a two-day property exhibition in Hong Kong recently,' he says. 'A
few potential buyers asked about the likely effect of a Labour government,
but most seem to think that prices are low enough, whereas in Hong Kong the
market is at an all-time high. We sold a house in Earls Court a week ago to
a Hong Kong buyer for about Pounds 600,000.'
Sir Glenn Hickman, marketing director of Humberts, says: 'The signals are
not good. We had an offer of Pounds 1m on a house immediately before the
election, but were told that if Labour won the buyer would have to
withdraw.'
Housebuilders have been hard hit by the recession, being forced to make
provisions against the values of their land banks, to reduce the prices of
houses and to give all sorts of incentives to achieve sales.
Charles Church, regarded as up-market developers, realigned themselves well
ahead of the election. Chief executive Stewart Baseley says: 'We have
virtually sold everything over Pounds 150,000, and for the past four months
we have concentrated on building for first-time buyers with an average
selling price of Pounds 100,000 in the south east.'
Geoffrey van Cutsem, a director of Savills, advises vendors to review their
asking prices immediately, or take their houses off the market if they do
not need to sell.
'Vendors have not yet accepted that prices of properties over Pounds 500,000
have dropped a further 10 per cent this year already,' he says. 'I don't
expect values to increase before 1993, and it will be four years before we
get back to the peak of early 1989.'
Having been seeking Pounds 1.95m for Hinwick House in Bedfordshire, which
has been the home of the Orlebar family for 500 years, Savills has just been
instructed to offer the house at Pounds 1m by the mortgagees.
Guy Galbraith, who runs the Edinburgh office of Savills, says that Philip
Byam-Cook, the former senior partner of City solicitors Macfarlanes, has
reduced the price of his 23,000-acre Ben Alder sporting estate in the
Highlands from Pounds 2.5m to Pounds 1.75m.
As for the beautiful 3,400-acre island of Gigha, three miles off the Mull of
Kintyre, which Savills is selling for the Swiss bank Interallianz, the
heritable creditors of Malcolm Potier's Tanap Investments, it is unlikely to
approach the Pounds 5.25m paid for it in 1989.
Anthony Cane, the partner of Strutt and Parker, who is about to bring the
late Jim Joel's 450-acre Childwick Bury Stud in Hertfordshire to the market,
and is currently seeking Pounds 3.75m for the 1,500-acre Roadnight Farms at
Britwell Salome, Oxfordshire, says: 'People have got to lower their prices
if they want to sell.'
Andrew Grant, who has just celebrated 21 years as an estate agent in
Hereford and Worcester, has been selling higher-priced properties where
vendors have reduced their prices in recent weeks. 'People have got so fed
up with waiting,' he says. 'In the end you have to forget about politicians
and get on with your life.'
But Guy Galbraith of Savills has another tip for investors: 'Forestry is
going to be the thing,' he predicts. 'Where else can you protect your
investment in a tax-free environment?'

FT  11 APR 92 / Face to face with the real Soweto: A guided tour of the
township
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATTI WALDMEIR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EVERYONE knows what Soweto looks like: a tangled mess of squatter shacks
where armoured cars loom in the background and Zulus prance around waving
spears. Right?
Certainly, television news programmes portray South Africa's largest black
township - with a population of 3m  - that way. Pictures like that make
news. But for the businessman or tourist who finds himself in Johannesburg
for a few days, there is a different vision in store.
Jimmy's Face to Face Tours*, run by the ebullient Jimmy and his side-kick
Oupa, will take you to Soweto in comfort and relative safety for a
three-hour tour costing R55 (Pounds 11). They will collect you from your
hotel - late, true to African tradition  - and catapult you down the Golden
Highway toward the South Western Township (So-we-to) of Johannesburg. You
will travel in a 'combi,' or 'black taxi,' the vehicle which takes hundreds
of thousands of Sowetans the 30km to work in white Johannesburg every day.
Your first view of Soweto will come from a pedestrian bridge over the Old
Potch road, one of only a handful of access routes to the township: the
planning authorities limited entry points so that Soweto could be sealed off
for security reasons in an instant.
Even on a warm summer day, when no one is burning coal or wood for heat, a
pall of smoke hangs over the township. Residents burn malodorous soft brown
coal for cooking, and for heating in winter; it gives Soweto a distinctive
smell and blocks out the sun on really bad days. At night, it refracts the
light from headlamps, leaving visibility poor and creating an air of mystery
and danger.
From the bridge on a bright day, though, Jimmy will show you the treeless
expanse which is Soweto. He promises you the bad, the ugly, the good and the
beautiful about his township. And he answers questions like: 'Why is Soweto
so dirty?' (not that any white tourist would dare ask him such a question,
but he volunteers unasked).
There is a lot of vacant land, he says, which residents use as a dumping
ground; local council officials embezzle funds for refuse removal, which is
erratic at best; and hawking and other forms of informal economic activity
(the kind which prevails in Soweto, where formal retailing was illegal until
recently) create a lot of rubbish. Also, Soweto is overcrowded, with several
structures - the traditional 'matchbox' houses, outside rooms and garages -
wedged on to every tiny plot.
But Jimmy does not focus on the squalor, nor the smoking rubbish tips which
can be seen at most street corners. He is proud of his township. He points
out that there are 23 millionaires in Soweto (Jimmy appears to be well on
his way to that status himself); and Oupa takes us to surburbs such as
Beverly Hills and Diepkloof Extension where multi-story homes, which would
qualify as mansions in any white suburb, are crowded on to the postage-stamp
plot.
Oupa points out the improvements residents have made to their homes:
additions, extensions, fancy front doors, small gardens, burglar bars. He
does not want visitors to think the township stews in its squalor; Sowetans
work hard to improve their surroundings.
Jimmy points with pride to the colourful Shangaan tribeswomen who hawk at
the roadside. They wear layers of extra cloth around their hips to simulate
the plumpness favoured by African men. We cruise past a handful of formal
retail outlets: in spite of its size, Soweto has almost no restaurants,
supermarkets or department stores because apartheid did not permit them.
Oupa points out scores of spaza shops where residents sell cool drinks,
maize meal, cigarettes and other essentials from their front room or garage.
We see barbers, tailors and mechanics plying their trade on waste ground by
the side of the road.
The climax of the tour is Jimmy's home in posh Diepkloof Extension, where he
boasts he bought his 1,000 sq metre plot for R5,000. With his Gauguin print
on the wall, extra-large TV and elaborate drinks cabinet - plus a stool made
from the foot of an elephant, complete with toe nails - Jimmy clearly had
made it into the Soweto bourgeoisie.
Face to Face with Soweto includes no armoured cars or warlike Zulus, and
relatively few squatter shacks. It is not a whitewash, though - just a view
of Soweto's complexity, beyond the cliches.

its own currency

<DATELINE>
   THE YEAR 1992 is the year of the single European market
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
and not far behind is the prospect of the single European currency, the Ecu.
However, in the Cotswold town of Stroud, things seem to be going into
reverse. There, the Stroud 'Green pound' is flourishing, and the 155 members
of the Stroud LETS (Local Employment and Trading System) syndicate have for
the past 23 months traded regularly in 'Strouds' as well as pounds sterling.
The Strouds build up as credits which are then used to pay for various goods
and services between members of the scheme. It amounts to a sophisticated
form of bartering. Based on a scheme devised in British Columbia in 1983, it
was successfully copied in rural communities in Australia, New Zealand and
the US before arriving in the UK.
The Stroud LETS system is the biggest and probably the most successful of
the 20 similar schemes operating in the UK. During this year a dozen other
UK communities plan to follow suit.
'Although we did not set it up with the intention of being a long-term thing
we are gaining four or five new members a month,' said a founder member,
Maggie Mills.
The wholefood cafe run by Mills and her husband John in Stroud is the focus
of the scheme. It is there that LETS members, who pay Pounds 7.50 and 10
Strouds to join, take their Stroud cheques or 'credits' to be fed into the
computer programme that controls the system, operated by 'banker' Sandra
Bruce.
'While Strouds are a quasi-currency and a Stroud is roughly equivalent to a
pound there is no coinage, so we are in no way breaking Bank of England
regulations,' said Bruce, who is paid in LETS 'credits' for running the
system and who recently spent 1,000 Strouds through LETS members when she
moved house and redecorated.
There are many advantages in the Stroud LETS system for those who live
around the town. No interest is paid - either by those in debit or credit.
This provides a considerable inducement for members to go into debit, which,
as the 'Green' economists behind the scheme point out, is the key factor to
the scheme.
'It has to be a good thing because the Stroud LETS system runs in parallel
with the conventional sterling economy. People in the system can trade in
Strouds, or sterling, or a mixture of the two,' said Roger Opie, Oxford
economics don and Fellow of New College, who recently spent a day in Stroud
examining the scheme.
'The Stroud LETS system is a non-profit-making community institution run for
the benefit of local people. Therefore there is no need to charge interest,
which in conventional economies is also used as a means of controlling and
regulating the flow of scarce money.
'Since Strouds, or Links (Wiltshire), or Trugs (Lewes), or Acorns (Totnes)
or whatever they call them in other towns can be created by the simple act
of people getting into debt, there never need be any scarcity of them to
regulate in the first place. LETS credits, whatever they are called in
individual systems, are as abundant as people's willingness to share their
skills.'
But what if one of the members goes heavily into debt and then 'disappears'
 -or simply moves away? The official answer is that the remaining members
then share the amount of the default among them. However, in practice this
is unlikely to happen in a relatively small community in which most of the
members of the LETS know each other.
And what happens when a businessman files his income tax or VAT return?
Again, according to the Stroud LETS organisers, there is a simple answer.
For the purposes of tax or VAT the trader simply 'converts' his Strouds
income into pounds and declares the required figure in sterling.
According to Opie, 'what is really impressive about the Stroud pound is
that, as far as I can see, it contravenes no laws or currency regulations,
and it acts as a stimulus to the local economy. It gives the unemployed
something they can trade in when they do not have sterling, and it allows
people to trade their skills for goods or other skills without resort to
cash they might not possess.
'In Stroud the community which LETS has helped to forge is so strong that
the system works. But I think its strength lies in its smallness. It might
not work so well if the network grew beyond a certain size. But I don't
think I'd sell my house for Strouds, even if I were a member of LETS.'

FT  11 APR 92 / As they say in Europe: The old order grumbles
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES MORGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'THE RESULTS are a bitter protest against the policies of the big parties.'
That was Die Welt writing about the outcome of the regional polls in Germany
last weekend. The French papers had said the same thing about their local
elections. 'The protest votes reached almost half the total. They punished
the socialists without helping the right,' Liberation noted.
In Italy the headline in Tuesday's La Repubblica was 'The Christian
Democratic wall collapses and the voters punish the Socialists.' The Vatican
paper, L'Osservatore Romano, wrote: 'The rule of the patricians of the
ancien regime has collapsed. Italians have had enough of the rituals of an
ageing court behind closed doors, never heeding the cries of the populace
pressing against the palace gate.' Before the election the bishops had
ordered Catholics to vote Christian Democrat, so it seems the Vatican plans
to ditch its ally, prime minister Giulio Andreotti.
The German view of the British election implied that it too should have
ended in the disaster that fell on continental establishments. While the
French found the campaign entertaining, worth several hundred words of
cheery comment, to the Germans press it was unedifying. But Die Zeit and the
Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung would find Mother Theresa unedifying.
Bernhard Heimrich of FAZ may have seemed to think highly of the Liberal
Democrat leader, Paddy Ashdown - 'Next to Major and Kinnock, Ashdown will
always look the youthful hero' ran his headline. But the piece put Paddy in
his place: 'This time the Captain felt good before the battle, he came out
with the words of Bismarck that no German now could mouth: he was grabbing
the hem of the coat of the fast moving events of history - 'But was it
really God?''
You do not follow this? Nor did the Germans I asked, but then in the FAZ it
is normal to kick off with a complex reference to Bismarck. Heimrich
continued, 'He (Ashdown) was also one of those who, under the pressure of
competition, made the inevitable comparison with the demagogy of Goebbels.
But he got the first name mixed up: 'Hermann Goebbels.' Anyway the fault
betrays the fact that today even in Britain, the post-war generation runs
the election campaign.'
Jurgen Kronig ran a 'Tories Panic' piece in Die Zeit that saw Ashdown as
something of a beacon in a campaign dominated by insularity and the Tory
tabloids' unsuccessful attempts to blacken the reputation of the Labour
leader, Neil Kinnock. 'Labour and Conservatives almost created the
impression that the rest of the world did not exist.'
That was before two states voted in a way to make the rest of the world
wonder about Germany. But the rise of parties reminiscent of the
not-so-distant German past did not generate the anxiety that might have been
expected. Bild shouted: 'Is there a threat of a new Hitler?' but most
concluded it was part of the great European protest. The Neue Osnabrucker
Zeitung wrote: 'One understands those fears which arise from the past but
when an Israeli paper recalls 1933 and comes to the conclusion, 'Now it's
all starting again,' that is false and unjust. There are other sounds from
abroad which are all too shrill and dissonant - not least from our French
neighbours in their glasshouse.'
The leading resident of the glasshouse, Le Monde, replied: 'When a small
far-right grouping shows up east of the Rhine, when a wave of violence
against immigrants develops, the warnings erupt against the resurgence of
neo-nazism among our neighbours. In recent years, the Germans, taking things
calmly, have made much of the fact that the extreme right was making greater
progress in France than over there . . .' So Le Monde threw no stones.

FT  11 APR 92 / Gardening: Scots soil to suit the bonnie heather - A garden
to visit: Arthur Hellyer starts a new series with a trip to a whisky
distillery's acreage in Scotland
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ARTHUR HELLYER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONE OF the most remarkable gardens in Scotland today belongs to a whisky
distillery. Bell's Cherrybank Gardens is a seven-acre extension to an
existing 11-acre garden which had already created a considerable name for
itself.
It all started when new office premises for Arthur Bell and Sons were opened
on the western outskirts of Perth, overlooking the city and the Tay valley.
This was a straightforward piece of industrial landscaping, started in 1978,
involving the use of trees, shrubs, herbaceous plants and water on a
considerable scale.
Robert Matthew Johnson-Marshall-Sportswork was awarded the contract; the
firm is said to have planted 65,000 shrubs and 1,200 trees, plus an
unspecified number of hardy perennials. Informal in design, a river-like
lake at its lowest point is fed partly by a natural burn. It has a complex
pattern of curving lawns and flower beds with dense, labour-saving planting
and great attractiveness for wildlife.
A notable feature of this garden is an elaborate mosaic, made with Italian
glass, which depicts a coat-of-arms. This fine garden, which is open to the
public, was given a Civic Trust Award in 1982.
But this is not my reason for drawing attention to the Bell's garden today.
What is important nationwide is Bell's Cherrybank Gardens, started in 1984
on seven acres of land adjacent to the office garden but rising well above
it, and intended as a heather garden.
It has its own water features, and the overall design was also by Robert
Matthew Johnson-Marshall-Sportswork, but the heather collection was planned
by Hazel Huddlestone. It is extremely impressive and already occupies a
large part of the ground, although there is still scope for extension.
There are now about 40,000 heather plants in 730 varieties. Norrie
Robertson, the head gardener, told me that he does all heather planting in
March. He waters all plants thoroughly before planting - and not very much
afterwards - and he uses a lot of pit sand when planting.
The soil is naturally a little acid, and this suits all heathers well, but
there was near disaster in the early days when the M90 motorway was being
constructed above the garden. A large quantity of lime was present in the
foundation material used for the road, and some of this washed down into the
garden, raising the alkalinity. However, the excess lime was washed out and
there have been no further problems from that source.
The heathers are in superb condition, planted in large blocks,in big curving
beds spread on the open hillside which provides a spectacular site for
display. Its excellence has been recognised by its designation as one of the
two National Collections of Heathers in Britain by the National Council for
the Conservation of Plants and Gardens, the other being in the Royal
Horticultural Society's garden at Wisley, Surrey, a very different site on
flat ground with numerous small trees including conifers.
Cherrybank has its own landscaping, quite distinct from that of the office
garden. There are fewer trees and shrubs, as befits its hillside situation
and prime use for heather cultivation, and it contains several other
features, including a children's playground, a dovecot stocked with
fantails, an aviary and a trellis garden with a set of tubular bells.
There is also a stream starting high up in the garden, artificially fed. The
water flows sinuously down the hillside between clean, stone-lined banks,
feeding several ponds. One of these is said to have remarkable acoustic
properties, creating different sounds as the water plays against the
circular surrounds. There are also a number of attractive statues, some the
work of Ian MacKintosh, others by Lawrence Broderick.
A visitor centre has been built at the top of the Cherrybank Gardens, which
also contains a small restaurant. It is now the main point of entry to both
the heather and the office gardens: the two, although separate entities, are
inter-connected.
Norrie Robertson heads a team of five gardeners who keep the place in
impeccable condition. About 20,000 visitors are welcomed every year, and
money is collected for charity from collecting-boxes, and from a
wishing-well.
The gardens are open on the first weekend in May until the middle of
October. The heather garden is never without flowers throughout the year:
one of the great attractions of heathers is that the numerous species
provide a continuous succession of flowers - though some seasons,
particularly spring and late summer to autumn, are more prolific than
others.

FT  11 APR 92 / Gardening: Your guide to the guides - Forget the election,
it's flower power that counts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   ALL essential guide books
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
revised and updated  - are to hand, and the garden visiting season is in
full swing again. Not that it stops completely: there are many gardens which
remain open throughout winter; but the full pageant of those open to the
public is revealed between April and October.
The most useful guides are:
Gardens of England and Wales, the familiar yellow book of the National
Gardens' Scheme Charitable Trust;
Scotland's Gardens, also yellow-covered;
the Guide to Gardens Opening Under Scotland Gardens' Scheme, also a
charitable organisation;
Historic Houses, Castles and Gardens in Great Britain and Ireland, produced
commercially by British Leisure Publications;
The Good Garden Guide, published by Vermilion.
The two yellow books are concerned solely with gardens opening for their
respective charities, and are by far the best at leading visitors to small
and medium-sized privately-owned gardens, many of which are only open on one
or two afternoons in the year.
The books also list some bigger gardens and many of those can also be found
in the commercially produced garden guides. Every year the lists get longer:
this year Gardens of England and Wales lists more than 2,800 gardens, the
largest number ever to support this highly successful charity. This year it
aims to raise Pounds 1.4m.
There have been some criticisms of these charitable schemes. Some feel that
not all the gardens listed are worthy to be opened to the paying public. But
there are two answers to that. The first is that worthiness is very much a
matter of personal opinion; the second is that it is instructive, and often
entertaining, to see what is made of gardens by less skilled, less wealthy
owners. The gardens are all inspected by officers of the charities. Proof of
the pudding is that the public, in general, is delighted with what is on
offer, as demonstrated by the ever greater number of visitors and the very
considerable sums of money collected for a diversity of charities.
The Good Gardens Guide is the youngest of the guide books, first published
in 1990. It has quickly become a favourite because of the amount of
information it contains. This year it lists more than 1,000 of the best
gardens open to the public in Great Britain and Ireland. Many of the gardens
are privately owned, and some will be found also in the charities' guides.
(This can be welcome duplication because of the independently written
descriptions, which are occasionally critical and always try to convey some
idea of merit.) Originally this guide book tried to give a graded standard
of excellence to each garden but this has been dropped - sensibly, because
gardens vary so much in style and character that it is impossible to compare
them all on the same basis.
Historic Houses, Castles and Gardens has a wider brief than any of the
others, as its title makes plain; it also carries quite extensive
advertising for some of its properties. Information about the properties
themselves is brief, but includes full particulars about dates and times of
opening, facilities available, and price of entry. It has good outline maps
of the British Isles, showing where the various properties are. This year,
for the first time, quite a lot of full-colour illustration makes the book
much more attractive.
Yet another annually updated guide book that I carry in the car is The
National Trust Handbook. Although its properties are covered by one or other
of the other guides, there is usually a lot of additional useful
information. Gardens of England and Wales can be obtained from booksellers
at Pounds 2. Scotland's Gardens costs Pounds 2.50, including postage, from
Scotland Gardens Scheme, 31 Castle Terrace, Edinburgh. The Good Gardens
Guide costs Pounds 11.99 and Historic Houses, Castles and Gardens costs
Pounds 6.95, both from booksellers. The National Trust Handbook is sent free
to NT members or can be bought in bookshops for Pounds 3.95.

FT  11 APR 92 / Gardening: Bring on the cream buns - A growth area that has
little to do with plants: Catering to the millions who visit National Trust
gardens and houses has its problems - and rewards
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS LANDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ACROSS the country 126 restaurants and tea shops have just opened for
business. Before November 30, when most close for the winter, they will
serve 4.5m cups of tea and coffee, take Pounds 11m and contribute more than
Pounds 1m towards the upkeep of some of the country's finest buildings.
These restaurants and tea shops make up the increasingly important, and
increasingly professional, catering arm of the National Trust.
Although the 2m members and 10m visitors each year to National Trust
properties tend to associate a visit to a stately home with a stately tea
afterwards, this is a recent association. The trust is unusually vague about
when its catering operation began, but more precise about its very humble
origins.
It all started with the gardener at Hidcote Manor, Gloucestershire, selling
scones from his front parlour in the early 1960s - although the eclairs
offered on the weekly Connoisseurs' Day by the administrator's wife at
Saltram, Devon may have appeared a little earlier.
During the 1970s and 1980s the restaurants developed under David Mellor, a
former tea planter, and their annual turnover reached Pounds 3m by 1985.
Their financial importance to the future well-being of the National Trust
was only fully recognised by Ian Bollom, appointed finance director of the
NT in 1985 and by Anne Roberts, a former buyer with Next, the retail clothes
chain, now managing director of National Trust Enterprises Ltd.
Bollom saw the restaurants as under-appreciated sources of revenue which
would compensate for falling government grants (and falling farm revenues)
and set the restaurants demanding (but commercial) annual growth rates.
Roberts supplied the central organisation and the marketing vision. For the
NT today, catering is such an important financial concern that when its
finance committee meets to consider acquisitions, the potential number of
cups of tea a 'new' house could supply enters the equation.
To put its catering in the hands of a professional, the National Trust has
just appointed Sue Sewell, formerly operations director with contract
caterers Gardner Merchant, as national catering manager. At the age of 29,
Sewell takes charge of 16 regional managers, a seasonal staff of 2,500,
restaurants ranging in location from Souter Lighthouse, Northumbria, to
Mount St Michael off the Cornish coast.
Her job has unique problems and challenges. Unlike most other restaurateurs
she sees no sign of diminishing demand. There are, however, constraints on
where and for how many her restaurants can cater. The NT's sine qua non is
the preservation of its properties for future generations.
The preservation department frowns on the concentration of large numbers of
vistors who can only too easily damage buildings and contents and insists
that the houses have 'days-off' to recover. Private functions, a potential
source of extra revenue, are also discouraged; there is a worry that these
could cause irreparable damage.
The most practical solution to accommodate numbers and preserve the fabric
of the houses has been the conversion of many spare stable blocks and
out-houses into restaurants and tea-rooms. Converting these, however, into
pleasant dining areas and professional kitchens that meet the demands of the
new Food Safety Act requires capital and expertise. In 1992 the NT will
spend Pounds 1.2m on its catering infrastructure.
There are particular personnel problems, too. At certain NT properties, the
gardeners were used to walking into the kitchen for their tea. Under the new
laws they must first put on white hats and shoes.
Visitors to the properties often want to be served lunch and a potted
history of the property from their waitress at the same time. The British
weather can mean tremendous fluctuations in attendance, too; a sudden
downpour sends hundreds scurrying for shelter, tea and refreshments when
they are supposed to be in the grounds.
The challenge and potential for growth is enormous. One of the most
significant factors in the growth of NT catering is that popular tastes are
beginning to follow the trust's policy of home-baked, wholesome food with a
regional bias.
Many visitors, who even five years ago would have settled for a cooked
lunch, now appreciate the healthy virtues of lunch with local cheeses and
salad and the fact that 80 per cent of all the bread, cakes and scones the
trust sells are baked on the premises.
At Souter Lighthouse you can try pan haggerty or singin' hinny, two local
Northumbrian dishes, and there is a huge variety of local cheeses on offer,
from Pant-ys-Gawn goats' cheese at Powys Castle, Wales, to a farmhouse
Wensleydale in Yorkshire. On the Isle of Purbeck in Dorset a Trust tenant
farmer supplies the milk to the local dairy which makes Purbeck Dairy ice
cream for sale at the nearby Corfe Castle.
Sewell hopes to accentuate these regional differences because they so
clearly distinguish the Trust's restaurants. The National Trust, 36 Queen
Anne's Gate, London SW1H 9AS. Tel: 071-222-9251.

FT  11 APR 92 / Gardening: A self-starter that makes the mowing easier -
Tools designed to help gardeners
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ARTHUR HELLYER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
I HAVE BEEN using one of the latest Flymo lawn-mowers, the RRL429 Powerdrive
Electrostart, which must surely be the smallest machine of its kind to have
electric self-starting at the turn of a key. The rotary blade gives a 15in
cut and would be suitable for the smallest of gardens; yet, because of its
speed and easy operation, it will also tackle quite large areas.
This machine has all the refinements of much larger lawn-mowers, including
rear pick-up of cut grass into a conveniently detachable box; a full-width
rear roller to give the admired stripe effect when the grass has been cut;
and screw-adjusted height setting with a scale showing the height that has
been selected. (This ranges from under 1in to a remarkable 7in, enabling
enable the machine to be used for trimming meadow-length grass.) The
four-horsepower, four-stroke Tecumsah engine has power to spare and is
quiet, too.
This is a wheeled rotary grass cutter, not an air-cushion machine, and is an
illustration of the way in which the old, rather pointless controversy
between the manufacturers of these two types of powered lawn-mower has been
ended peacefully. Each system has its uses in the right places and
circumstances.
This new little Flymo is likely to make many friends. It is supplied
complete with an electric charger which can be plugged into any mains socket
for occasional topping-up of the starter battery; but there is also a
charger built into the engine so that replenishment of the battery goes on
continuously whenever the machine is being used. The price, complete with
all this equipment and including VAT, is Pounds 475.
I believe that the greatest acceleration in garden machine sales is
occurring with shredders, those invaluable devourers of woody waste in the
garden which make it possible to dispense with bonfires. Power-driven
shredders will convert all prunings and hedge trimmings into
instantly-usable mulches for flowers beds and borders, or for spreading
around individual trees and shrubs.
The old idea that such woody waste was bad for plants and soil has been
exploded. Huge quantities of commercially-produced wood chips and shreds are
being used in public parks, National Trust properties, botanic gardens and
those of the Royal Horticultural Society, to name just some. I have been
using shredded bark for the first time this winter and am very pleased with
the results.
Home shredders will not cope with the heavy wood used in
commercially-produced chips and shreds but, according to the size and power
of the machine, they will deal efficiently and speedily with the prunings
and hedge trimmings which make up the bulk of the woody waste in gardens.
Some machines are powered by electric motors and some by petrol engines, the
former recommended for town gardens because of their relatively low noise.
Petrol is to be preferred in big country gardens in which it can be
convenient to take the machine to the work rather than the reverse.
The nylon cord rotary grass trimmer, or strimmer, is another tool that has
found favour with the gardening public. It has taken all the difficulty out
of cutting grass close to walls, trees and other hard objects. The
fast-rotating nylon cord is so flexible that, although it cuts through the
toughest grass and quite a lot of even tougher weeds, it is turned aside
harmlessly by any hard objects.
Again, there is a choice between electric motors and petrol engines, most of
the latter serving the dual role of grass trimmers and brushwood cutters
when fitted with some type of metal blade in place of the nylon cord.
In this development, they must be regarded as potentially dangerous tools,
suitable for use only by trained people and with full safety precautions.
But, for nylon cord trimming, the petrol-engined machines are just as safe
as the electrically-driven ones.
They have the advantage that they can go anywhere, irrespective of an
electric supply being available. Certainly, these large machines have solved
the rough grass-cutting problems of many large gardens and parks.
I have found that some of the very small, low-priced electric nylon cord
trimmers have inadequate power to deal with anything tougher than fairly
soft grass - but with more power, the densest grass and quite tough weed
stems can be slashed through. It is the speed of rotation of the nylon cord
that makes it effective as a cutter, and that is what an under-powered motor
cannot supply.
Some nylon cord trimmers have heads which can be rotated through 90 degrees,
making it possible to use them in the vertical position to cut lawn edges as
well as in the horizontal plane for the flat lawn. I find this a
considerable time saver.
Power-driven hedge trimmers tend to get a bad press on the score of danger
and, undoubtedly, too many accidents do occur. Yet I could not manage my
garden without one of these tools, and it is really a matter of taking all
the necessary precautions and of buying a well-designed machine with
adequate safety checks.
Again, you have the choice between electricity and petrol as the source of
power although, with electricity, there is the added risk of cutting through
the cable while using the machine. But proper earthing and cut-out devices,
plus a safe method of trailing the power cable over the shoulder, will
reduce any dangers to a minimum.
There are many small hand tools and other pieces of equipment which, while
seldom written about, will save a lot of time and trouble in the garden. One
is a pair of secateurs small enough to be slipped easily into the pocket so
as to be available at any time for jobs as varied as cutting string to light
pruning.
There is also an ingenious little tool called the Widger, which I thought
had dropped out of use until I came across it in the big sundries catalogue
of Joseph Bentley Ltd, Barrow on Humber. This is a metal and plastic dibber,
seedling transplanter, tiny trowel and weeder all in one; so small that it
can live in your gardening coat.
Lopping shears can be great time-savers but they must have strong handles
and powerful blades. Too many fail to cut easily and the handles bend when
cutting really thick stems.
It is worth spending up to Pounds 40 for a good pair of loppers. It does not
matter if the blades are of the anvil or the bypass type; I use both and
have no preference.
Hoes need careful choice to suit personal preferences for easy use and
movement. I still like the old Wilkinson Swoe, a dutch-type hoe with the
handle attached only at one end of the blade which, in consequence, can be
hooked firmly around tough weeds to cut them off or drag them out, and can
also reach behind plants to stir the soil.
I find a spring-toothed grass rake useful for much gathering of rubbish in
addition to that for which it is primarily intended; namely, the cleaning
and aeration of lawns. A pair of long-handled hedging shears can still be
the best tool for trimming grass in awkward places and, even if you have a
hedge trimmer, shears are a necessity for some jobs. When shopping for
these, hold them in the hands and test them for weight and balance before
deciding which ones to buy.
Many garden chemicals now come ready-packed in the small, flask-type
sprayers operated by a trigger. I keep a supply of spare flasks for special
purposes, one for glyphosate herbicide for the difficult weeds; another for
Weedol, especially for cooch and other grasses; and a third in spring and
summer for a harmless greenfly killler such as perimicarb. The plastic pumps
of these sprayers do not last for long, but they are cheap to replace and
most handy to use.
Finally, in a garden of any size you must have a wheelbarrow. For the rough
and heavy work, I use an ordinary navvy barrow; but for all other jobs I
like a barrow with a ball-shaped wheel which will ride easily over all the
bumps and up and down any steps.

FT  11 APR 92 / Gardening: Plant of the week - Prunus Pink Perfection
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ARTHUR HELLYER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A number of ornamental cherries of fairly complex parentage are simply known
by their garden names under the general heading Japanese Garden Cherries
since they were first introduced from Japan though many have since been
raised in the West. Pink Perfection is a particularly beautiful variety
raised in England from a seed taken from an old variety named Shimidsu. It
is considered by many gardeners to be better than the ever-popular Kanzan
since it is a purer pink colours. Like Kanzan its branches are held upwards
making a shuttlecock-shaped tree especially when young. The flowers are
fully double and freely produced. The young leaves are an attractive light
bronze. Like all Japanese cherries it will thrive in a wide variety of soils
with a special liking for those containing chalk or lime.

FT  11 APR 92 / Gardening: Why pigs perk up Parma violets - Robin Lane Fox's
thoughts turn again to manure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBIN LANE FOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN THE aftermath of an election, you will forgive me for returning to the
topic of pig manure. You may feel that enough of it has been distributed
metaphorically up and down the country for there to be no need for
discussing the availability of private heaps. However, so many of you have
written to ask for a source of urine-free, pre-crumbled pig dung after one
of my recent articles that I can only answer you collectively.
The topic seems to interrelate with this paper's other interests. Only one
of you was specific, saying that she wanted to send a bag of it to her life
insurance salesperson on learning, after the deal, about the level of his
commission. The rest of you are keeping its destination secret.
I fear that there is no single centralised source: transport would be
expensive and I am not sure about Datapost's rules on scent. My supplies
come from a pig farm six miles away which cannot deliver to a greater
radius.
The sensible course is to check where pigs are kept locally, find out if the
manure has stood and cooled for a while and then offer to collect it in
bags, equipped with rubber gloves as it can cause a rash when too fresh.
In spring, you may see some little tin pig-shelters out in the field: if so,
stop and think. They are not just a warning of the levels to which we might
have been reduced in another five years: where there is shelter there is -
well, you know what I mean, and probably the farmer will sell it to you.
Rotted manure is worth buying and I credit it with the two main consolations
in my post-electoral garden. Last year, I bought a replacement plant of the
double lilac-flowered primrose, Primula lilacina plena. It had entered my
life through a Weekend FT reader who kindly posted me a fragment of his
plant in a metal canister just at the time of a wave of terrorist letter
bombs. It was only after submersion in the village pond that the traces of
grit on the surface turned out to be nothing but compost: the plant
flourished for years, giving great pleasure until we moved house.
When the same primula eventually reached me from Wiltshire, I split it into
three parts, each of which now has more than 30 flowers. The cause is
simple: not shade, water nor green fingers, but an explosive charge of my
own devising: pure pig manure beneath it. Primroses seem to thrive on this
rich mixture: pack the animal explosion into the upper six inches of soil
because primroses never root very deeply.
This double lilac-flowered primrose has a particular charm. It is the oldest
garden form whose historical pedigree is certain. The same variety was
growing in the 18th century, at the latest: its double flowers are
distinctive, and in them we see a double primrose as gardening poets like
Pope or Shenstone.
Other double varieties are mentioned by the dozen in Tudor books on
gardening, but unless their illustrators are inaccurate, they cannot be
plants in modern circulation. Sometimes, we have taken over their names, but
the originals have probably died out.
If they had been fed more richly, perhaps they would have survived four
centuries.
Pig manure has not merely toned up the oldest form of primroses: it has also
worked wonders on those vanishing beauties, the violets. In the 1970s, named
varieties of sweet violet had almost become a lost cause, lamented by their
few private growers and apparently doomed in the general market.
The picture is better nowadays and certainly clearer, not least because of
The Plant Finder's annual listings. Down in Bridport in Dorset, C W Groves
and Son has been stocking some of the standard hardy varieties for years
without undue advertisement.
It also sells some of the double-scented Parma varieties, including Comte de
Brazza who seems to have been de-classed nowadays and renamed as Swanley
White.
Early this year, I made a raid on Groves where the violets are potted up in
a cold house behind a general garden store selling anything from bird seed
to large potatoes for baking. Among the young stock, I hit on old garden
friends such as Baroness Rothschild and John Raddenbury, among other
varieties in honour of the Grove family themselves.
Like primroses, violets seem to like a very potent soil. There have never
been such violets as those in the Edwardian era, and I now find that their
books on the subject insisted that the best violets needed a very rich diet.
In those days, richness meant cow, not pig, a preference which fits with the
violet's mythology.
The story goes that the god Zeus first created violets after wooing the fair
young Io, and turning her into a cow after the event, so that nobody would
suspect her and interrupt the affair. Nowadays, lovers become cows rather
later in the male imagination, but you can see that the lady needed
something good to eat: Zeus, therefore, created the violet in her meadow as
a sort of nutritional IOU.
Perhaps in the 1990s we would alter the myth anyway, and say that he was a
frightful pig. Pig-manure, certainly, has worked wonders under my plants
from Groves' good list. The Duchesse de Parma is up and running; the
Princess of Wales is a leggy variety but has quickly recovered her spirits.
The next hazard will be red spider, the violet's worst enemy in warm
weather. Meanwhile, if you want to keep it, manure it heavily, honouring the
animal strain in its origins.

FT  11 APR 92 / Motoring: Conservative victory brings some relief to motor
industry - The implications of the election result
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STUART MARSHALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR THE motor industry and trade, a convincing Labour victory in the general
election had been rated worrying but not the ultimate disaster.
The industry believed a hung parliament would have been worse because it
would have prolonged the uncertainty from which it had suffered for so long.
A return of the Conservatives with a sound working majority was earnestly
hoped for. But few believed it was more than a remote possibility.
Ford's pre-polling day view was typical. It considered Labour's plans to hit
the new car buying classes with higher personal taxation could only make the
market shrink further. A drop in the total market this year from 1.7m to
1.5m if Kinnock replaced Major at number 10, had been pencilled into Ford's
forecasts. Bad though this was, the uncertainty caused by a hung parliament
with the Liberal Democrats holding the balance of power would have been
worse.
'For weeks, everyone held off buying until they knew what was going to be in
the Budget in March,' said Ford. 'The chancellor cut the 10 per cent Special
Car Tax by half. That was good; it reduced the price of an average family
car by around Pounds 400. We made some price cuts of our own and for a few
days, sales went up.
'Then the general election was called. Instantly, everything went dead as
buyers waited to see what was going to happen. Would the Tories get back?
Would Labour take over? Or would the Liberal Democrats have control over a
hung parliament which could easily lead to another general election within a
year? One result of the indecision was that British new car registrations
tumbled 15 per cent last month compared with March a year ago - and they
were far lower then than they had been a year earlier,' said Ford.
The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, representing both sides of
the motor business, has been unwilling to commit itself publicly. 'We are,
and must be seen to be, non-political,' a spokesman said.
Labour's claim that its tax proposals would leave most wage earners better
off cut little ice with the motor business. 'Even if what they said was
true, giving under-Pounds 22,000-a-year families with two kids and a
mortgage another couple of pounds a week to spend is hardly going to make
them rush out and buy new cars,' one large dealer said before polling day.
But increasing the marginal tax rate for the better off from 40 per cent to
59 per cent could only have a serious effect on their car buying habits.
'In many cases the husband will still have his company car. But is he going
to buy his wife the new estate car or hatchback she has had her eye on? More
likely he will be worrying about finding next year's school fees,' the
dealer said.
The chancellor of the exchequer's budget last month held out hopes of
changes in company car taxation. In future, the tax band a company car came
into would depended only on price. Engine cylinder capacity would not count
any more. All the details were to have been sorted out by summer. Now they
will. This measure will remove one of the handicaps from which fuel saving
and environmentally friendly diesel cars have suffered.
They use up to 30 per cent less fuel than comparable petrol cars but often
have slightly larger engines. That puts them into the next tax band and can
more than double the user's personal income tax liability.
During the run-up to the election neither Labour nor Liberal Democrats had
much to say about diesel cars; it was as though they were barely aware of
their existence.
After three years of Tory tightening of the screw on the 'perk' element of
company-car use, the last budget slightly eased the pressure.
Company cars are of critical importance to the motor industry. They account
for an estimated 52 per cent of all new registrations. The industry had
feared that with a change of government, the situation for company car
buyers and users could only have got worse.
The industry had detected an anti-motoring attitude, presented as a concern
for the environment, among both Labour and Liberal Democrats. Reducing the
number of cars (particularly company cars) driven into cities, and
persuading drivers to use improved public transport systems, is dear to both
parties.
How would this have been achieved in the lifetime of a parliament? One
option was road pricing. It would have had the dual purpose of penalising
car use in city centres and funding improved bus and train services.
Or there could have been a sharp rise in the excise duty on petrol. The
greener elements of Labour and Liberal Democrats think this a good thing.
Above all, what the motor industry and trade needs is a period of stability
in which it can lick its wounds and plan for the future. It now hopes that
it will get it.

FT  11 APR 92 / Golf: The art of an old master
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN HOPKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN ITS own country, the US Masters is more than just the first of golf's
four annual major championships. It is a rite of spring, like the opening of
the baseball season, and there are many pleasures to be derived from
attending it.
One of the greatest is watching Sam Snead limbering up on the practice
ground, and then performing the duties of honorary starter on Thursday
morning. Snead is undoubtedly the best golfer of his age in the world. He
was born in the mountains of west Virginia. 'The sides of the valleys were
so steep the dogs wagged their tails up and down', Snead wrote in his
autobiography. He went on to win 84 tournaments on the US tour and nearly
150 worldwide, including the 1946 Open at St Andrews.
He is known for owning more straw hats than a Bond Street milliner and
making more money than the gross national product of some Third World
countries, much of it from betting. 'Keep a close count of your nickels and
dimes, stay away from whiskey, and never concede a putt', is a maxim of his.
Legend has it that he stores his money in tomato cans buried in his garden.
Snead was blessed with a golf swing that is the envy of the world of golf -
long and powerful, the Swiss watch of golf swings for its smoothness and
faultless rhythm.
It all stems from his remarkable suppleness. No matter that he is 80 next
month, Snead can still place the palms of his hands on his shoes and bend
the thumbs of his hands back to touch his forearms. When he was well past
60, he could swing a leg and touch the ceiling.
To what does he attribute his longevity, not to mention his elasticity?
'I've never smoked and I've never been a drinker', he says. 'Two out of
three ain't bad.'
Snead, who won the Masters in 1949, 1952 and 1954, and Gene Sarazen, the
1935 champion, are the tournament's honorary starters. They tee off at 8.30
on the first morning and play nine holes in front of an admiring and
appreciative gaggle of spectators. There is good interplay between the two
old codgers. Sarazen is unable to bend to tee-up his ball, so Snead does it
for him.
After Sarazen has clipped a drive down the fairway, he smiles. Then Snead
smashes his ball 270 yards down the fairway. 'He should hit it a long way',
jokes the 90-year-old Sarazen. 'He is only a kid. When I was his age I hit
it that far, too.'
I usually watch this journey down memory lane with Robert Macdonald, a
publisher of golf books in New York, and, sometimes, Herbert Warren Wind,
the doyen of American golf journalists.
Macdonald, a good golfer and better squash player, is the organiser of the
sweep we have on the outcome of the tournament. Four of us participate and
the stake is Dollars 1. Last July, after he had completed the arduous fiscal
task of working out the winnings, Macdonald sent me a note. 'Robert won the
Dollars 3 dollars because he picked Woosnam', it read. 'I am not going to
pay it to him. So much money will go to his head.'
After paying homage to Snead and Sarazen last year we returned to the old
wooden clubhouse for breakfast of scrambled eggs, bacon, orange juice,
coffee and wholewheat toast. 'Did you see Snead tied for the lead in the
par-three contest?' asked Macdonald.
This contest is held the afternoon before the first round on the club's
nine-hole course, which is laid out over small lakes, down avenues of
azaleas, rhododendron bushes and dogwood. No hole is longer than 160 yards,
none shorter than 80. It is as demanding as it is beautiful.
'Snead shot 24 and tied with Rocco Mediate, Billy Ray Brown and Kenny Knox'
said Macdonald. 'That is amazing. Snead is 78. These guys are 28.'
The merit of Snead's performance can hardly be exaggerated. At his best
Snead was imperious from tee to green, hitting the ball huge distances. He
was a streaky putter, much like Ian Woosnam is now. More than 20 years ago
Snead's putting was affected by the yips and he began to putt side-saddle.
It looked ridiculous but it worked.
That a man of his age and with that putting style could match many of the
world's best golfers over nine holes almost beggared belief. I rank it as
one of the great sporting achievements of 1991.
Sadly, Snead was not able to try and repeat the feat this year. Driving to
Augusta on Tuesday he was involved in a car crash and dislocated a shoulder.
I hope he will be able to resume duties at next year's Masters. He and his
straw hat are as much a part of the scene as the azaleas and the dogwood.
The Masters may be an institution. Snead is a legend.

FT  11 APR 92 / Yachting: The American's cup
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEITH WHEATLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ROD 'Rocket' Davis, one of America's top sailors and now a New Zealand
citizen, once gave an off-the-cuff explanation of the extraordinary success
of Kiwi yachting. 'People in the outside world don't realise you have to be
able to handle a boat to get off that goddamn island. It's an escape route',
said Davis.
In some US circles he will never live down the soubriquet 'Benedict' Davis
(after the War of Independence traitor Benedict Arnold), bestowed by rival
helmsman Dennis Conner. For Davis is skipper of the New Zealand yacht
challenging for the America's Cup. After a near-flawless campaign the Kiwis
are in the challenger finals.
Fate stage-managed a race on Tuesday that eliminated Japan from the final
four and confirmed New Zealand's place. While the technology and financial
muscle for the Nippon challenge came from Tokyo, her key sailors were Kiwis,
led by Chris Dickson, who did not fit with the NZ sailing establishment.
In reasonably consistent 9-to-12-knot winds, Japan won the start, led by 17
seconds at the first turn and then by 21 secs after the first run. It was
the kind of performance that had brought Japan through the three round
robins as an unlikely points leader. However, Davis drove the Kiwi sailors
like a Roman galley master up the second beat and at the top mark reversed
the deficit to lead by 21 secs. New Zealand covered Nippon's every move to
ensure a 31-sec victory.
'They made it tough for us', said Davis. 'Anyone who thought they would lie
down just because they were as good as eliminated was absolutely wrong. I'm
pleased because we showed again that if we sail smart, our boat can take the
passing lanes. So we can always win, even when behind.'
Davis is going to have to prove that statement against another US helmsman
sailing as a mercenary, Paul Cayard. Il Moro di Venezia, skippered by
Cayard, is the other challenger finalist. She started out with NZ as joint
favourite to make the finals, so once more the form book is vindicated.
Italy's predicted chances were based more on firepower than previous
success. Syndicate head Raul Gardini, former head of the Ferruzzi
conglomerate, has spent close to Dollars 70m (Pounds 40m) of the company's
money on a five-boat programme that left no developmental stone unturned.
Yet even Cayard's deft and conciliatory personality has been unable to steer
round the cultural problems that tend to occur when Italians and
Anglo-Saxons collaborate. Cayard began the semi-finals by bringing more
Americans aboard, the most significant being Stevie Erickson, his regular
crew from two-man Star class.
Erickson is unable to sail actively on Il Moro, having not qualified by two
year's residence in Italy, but he has ousted Gardini from the owner's
'jump-seat' position. Rules bar him from participating in the running of the
yacht, but he discusses wind directions and tactics with Cayard until the
10-minute gun.
Another - American  - pal of 'Cayardini', as the sailors call him, is
watching from the tender and calling advice. John Kolius has been tune-up
skipper for Cayard for over a year, and the two are as inseparable as Bonnie
and Clyde.
Given that the sub-text of any America's Cup campaign is an inflamed
technology-led nationalism normally found only in wartime, one might suggest
that the New Zealanders need only stand back and let civil war take out the
Italian challenge.
Certainly the French team eliminated themselves from the semi-finals. Their
boat was fast - in five jousts the Kiwis had not managed to beat Ville de
Paris - but Marc Pajot's team came out for the final four on a downward
slide.
On the morning of the first race, French finance controller Yvon Kergreis
was discovered diving beneath the Nippon keel as she left the dock.
Apparently it was a prank rather than espionage, but an outraged and
embarrassed Pajot sent Kergreis back to Paris on the first aeroplane. 'I am
really disappointed', said Pajot. 'We are playing sport, not spying.'
Humour rather than retribution was the Nippon response. 'I accept Marc's
apology but I would still like to see his keel', said Dickson. An hour later
there was a pre-start collision between Nippon and Ville de Paris - judged
to be the latter's fault  - which took the front metre off the French bow
and seemed to destroy Pajot's will to win.

FT  11 APR 92 / Soccer: Ferguson's finest face the final whistle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER BERLIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SOCCER professionals are not bookish types. They value educated feet over
educated minds. But while none of the players at Manchester United or Leeds
United is likely to be reading Campaigns of Napoleon in the dressing room,
history will weigh heavily on them as they drag their weary legs round the
muddy playing fields of England in the last weeks of the long struggle for
the English League championship.
In the past 25 years both clubs have failed, in different ways, to live up
to expectations.
Manchester United have struggled to meet the expectations of the Matt Busby
years. Busby created three great sides, the last of which - the team of
Charlton, Law and Best - completed in style the task which the tragic Busby
Babes began: the quest for the European Cup. Since then, the club has failed
to recapture either the League title, the greatest domestic honour and the
only ticket to the European Cup, or the elan of the Busby period. In spite
of the wealth its huge support gives it, and the continued fertility of its
youth system, its best has been second place behind Liverpool twice.
Leeds, which succeeded Busby's last team as the dominant club in English
soccer, won the championship in 1969 and 1974. But in the 10 years from 1965
they finished second five times, lost three of four FA Cup finals, and lost
in the finals of all three European competitions.
Alex Ferguson, the Manchester United manager, has been struggling to build
(or buy) a winning side since he took over six years ago. If his team do win
the championship this season, they will perhaps most resemble the first of
Busby's great teams: the 1952 champions. They were an ageing side which had
finished second four times in five years before grasping the title. Busby
broke up the team and started building again. There are signs that Ferguson
may have to do the same, win or lose, after this season.
Ferguson will soon have to replace the spine of his team. Brian Robson and
Steve Bruce, the two north-easterners who give Manchester United so much of
their competitive back-bone, may be nearing the end of their time at Old
Trafford.
Robson is 34. His body is battered and, even when he plays, he always seems
to be carrying some sort of injury. He might calculate that now is the time
to follow the example of two former England team-mates, Peter Reid and
Trevor Francis, the successful player-managers of Manchester City and
Sheffield Wednesday, while he still has enough football in his legs to
persuade some First Division (or Premier League) club to gamble on him.
Robson's heir-apparent in central midfield, Neil Webb, has hardly played
this season. He seems never to have regained his full fitness or his
manager's confidence since an injury three seasons ago. He will be 29 at the
end of this season and his usefulness to Ferguson could nearly be over.
Bruce is the model of the English centre-half: big, strong and fearless,
indomitable in the tackle and dominating in the air, with an eye for goal
when he joins the attack. If he had had a little pace in his legs to go with
the crispness of his thought, he would have played many times for England.
But, at 31, age and opposing strikers are catching up with him.
Ferguson has spent on possible replacements. He signed Paul Parker, an
international defender, and Paul Ince, a skilful and competitive midfielder.
Both had histories of injury problems which have continued this season.
The most expensive item on Ferguson's summer shopping list will probably be
a goal-scoring striker. Brian McClair, bought to fill that role, is playing
deeper every season - perhaps a tactical ploy to bring much-needed deftness
to midfield but perhaps because the Scot, who suffered nightmares in front
of goal last year, has not regained his appetite for leading the attack
despite scoring 16 league goals.
His attacking partner, Mark Hughes, also prefers to strike from deep-lying
positions. For all his combative qualities, though, Hughes is a scorer of
great goals rather than a great goal-scorer, and has hit just eight in the
league.
This season, Manchester United have demonstrated one of the qualities said
to separate good teams from great ones: they win when they are not playing
at their best. Their greatest strength is on the wings where Ferguson can
chose between the Ukrainian, Andrej Kanchelskis; Lee Sharpe, last year's
'new George Best'; and Ryan Giggs, this year's 'new George Best' - and
perhaps the genuine article.
But the midfield frequently lacks a player who can reliably deliver long,
accurate, early passes to set the wingers galloping at, or past, full-backs,
and the attack often lacks players in position for crosses.
Manchester United hold the edge in the league race simply because they can
afford to lose one more game than Leeds. But with half-a-dozen games
remaining, there may be no second chances.
Napoleon said he prefered lucky generals to good ones. Ferguson and Howard
Wilkinson, his Leeds counterpart, could well discover he was right.

FT  11 APR 92 / Euro-Disney and the mouse that soared: A corporate empire
built on rodent power opens its latest theme park near Paris this weekend.
Its triumphs and the mounting challenges it faces
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIGEL ANDREWS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FACED with mouse infestation, most people call the council or comb the
Yellow Pages under 'P' for pest control. But year on year, decade on decade,
ever since the Disney empire was born in the 1920s, the world has stood by
dazed as a famous American rodent plants outposts everywhere from Los
Angeles to Tokyo.
This weekend, when Euro-Disney opens its 5,000 acres of surreal estate 20
miles north-west of Paris, Mickey will unveil his most controversial
venture. He and his colleagues hope for two things from the new theme park:
that it will pull the Disney empire out of its first period of choppy
fortunes since chairman Michael Eisner took over in 1984; and that even
sceptical old-world Europe will put out a welcome mat, rather than a
mousetrap, for America's most famous cartoon animal-cum-company logo.
The proportions of Euro-Disney are dizzying: Ffr23bn paid for it; a
specially enhanced transport structure to feed it (including road/rail links
to airports and central Paris); and six themed hotels with 5,200 beds to
service it. Around 11m visitors are expected in the first year: a modest
guestimate by Tokyo Disneyland's standard, where a one-day world attendance
record of 113,000 was set recently.
No other entertainment company in the world thinks in these statistical
terms. Yet, Disney's special status has been long acknowledged. So has its
classic American rags-to-riches story, which started in a small Kansas City
advertising office in the 1920s where Mickey was a real mouse prowling the
unknown Walt Disney's floor (originally, he was named Mortimer - until a
dissenting Mrs Disney stepped in). From there grew a giant corporate
ambassador for American ideals and values.
How dear Walt Disney's first-born was to his own heart was shown by the fact
that he dubbed the mouse's voice; only in later films did a smoker's cough
lay him off. Yet, even a man who made so many early sacrifices to promote
his hero-mascot - including selling his first car, a beloved Moon Cabriolet,
and humiliating himself in front of Louis B. Mayer ('Get that mouse off the
screen]' was the movie mogul's reported response to the cartoon character) -
cannot have foreseen his company's status at the century's end. In a recent
image-power survey, the mouse outfit lined up with Coca-Cola, Sony,
Mercedes-Benz and Kodak as the world's five most highly-recognised brand
names .
To the sub-teens, the age group expected to enjoy the company product most,
the Disney name is well out in front. Sixty years of an expanding
anthropomorphic menagerie - led by a mouse, a duck and, more recently, a
rabbit named Roger - have peopled young imaginations with timeless
characters. And Walt himself, when he battled sceptics to build the first
Disneyland in Los Angeles back in 1955, had the brainwave of sending his
movie characters into the 'real' world to mix with their fans.
The theme park tradition sprang up fully-armed in a small suburb called
Anaheim. Since then, the company has created near-identical copies in
Florida and Japan, where a few concessions in design policy to local taste
and traditions are mixed in with the essentials: the Sleeping Beauty's
castle; the adventure rides, including the incomparable Pirates of the
Caribbean (Walt's favourite); the mock-up American main street; and the
rumbustious parades in which larger-than-life Mickeys and Minnies, plus
Donalds and Goofys and Plutos, drive by as if they were the president, first
lady and retinue celebrating a daily inauguration.
Walt Disney would be delighted. Or would he? One thing Eisner and his motion
pictures chief, Jeffrey Katzenberg, seem to have done since they took office
after a fierce takeover battle is to turn Walt's Midas-touch mascot from a
symbol of innocence into a tough critter who stands no nonsense. Mickey
Mouse's company today is famed for its workaholic business hours ('If you
can't come in on Saturday, don't bother coming in on Sunday' goes one
apocryphal motto), its 10-page memos, power breakfasts, penny-pinching movie
budgets and stop-at-nothing litigiousness.
Since the mid-1980s, Disney has thrown lawsuits at anyone who threatens its
wholesome image or copyrighted characters. Targets have included an
Oscar-night production number in which actor Rob Lowe danced with a 'sexy'
Snow White, and a Florida day school that painted Mickey Mouse and company
on its walls; the characters had to be washed off on Disney's orders. This
opened the way for theme-park rival Universal, which scored a public
relations coup by stepping in and painting its best-known characters, the
Flintstones, on the walls. Rubbing salt (or sugar) into Disney's wounds,
Universal also threw a party for the children.
'Innocence' is a hard act to sustain in the cut-throat business world. But a
company that trades in squeaky-clean children's fantasies cannot be seen to
go round clobbering its grown-up adversaries or playing Scrooge to its fans.
As if sensing this, the boldest initiative Eisner and Katzenberg have taken
is to widen the franchise so that there is a less merciless make-or-break
focus on the kiddy-fare.
Developing production labels like Touchstone and Hollywood Pictures, they
have opened up the Disney movie division to adult comedies and dramas. Films
like Down And Out in Beverly Hills, Blaze, and Good Morning, Vietnam - which
would have been unheard-of in Walt's day  - are encouraged vigorously. And
Disney's single biggest hit of recent years was a comedy about a prostitute,
Pretty Woman.
Whether the founding father is spinning in his grave is a moot point. But
then, the very expression 'What would Walt have done?' was banned by
Katzenberg in the early days of the Eisner regime. 'I had a rule that that
phrase was never to be spoken in my presence,' says the studio chief. 'The
reason is that I had no idea - and nor did anyone else - what Walt would
have done. We had to make up our own minds and follow our hunches.'
Eisner himself stresses that the grown-up films are not a betrayal of the
Disney heritage: they are a way of acknowledging that the company's earliest
fans are now adults themselves and deserve their own line in movie
entertainment. But these grown-up fans are less easy to second-guess for a
company which has devoted its marketing expertise for six decades to
pleasing the very young.
Disney had a year of box-office flops in 1991, culminating in the debacle of
its 'adult' gangster movie, Billy Bathgate. And although there has been a
recent bounce-back, with films like Father of the Bride (Dollars 80m) and
Hands That Rock The Cradle (Dollars 60m) pushing Disney back to the top of
the Hollywood studio charts, periods of prosperity still seem to come from
fluke hits rather than a sustained house style.
The second problem with grown-up films is that they supply nothing to the
company's most important holding, its bestiary of well-loved cartoon or
live-action characters. This bestiary in turn replenishes, or should, those
mythological game preserves known as the Disney theme parks. With a small
handful of exceptions like Roger Rabbit, the parks have not been re-supplied
in decades. It could be a measure of Disney's anxiety on this front that it
has acquired the late Jim Henson's Creature Factory (best-known for the
Muppets).
If character productivity at Disney increased, the company's stock would no
doubt soar. The best news it has had in recent months is the success of its
Christmas-released animation feature, Beauty and the Beast. Shrewdly picking
a French-origin fairy tale in the run-up to Euro-Disney, the company pulled
out all stops and created a popular masterpiece. Crammed with memorable
characters and quality animation, the film has spun block-long queues around
American cinemas and became the first cartoon feature to win a best-film
nomination at the Oscars.
Strength-in-depth - the cultivation of an expanding character menagerie - is
one challenge for Disney. Strength in breadth is the other. As well as
enriching its cast of characters, Disney must ensure that the entertainment
dividends spread as wide as possible, with both the distribution of its
films and the dissemination of its theme parks. The company's parks division
had a bad year in 1991, hit by the recession and the after-shocks of the
Gulf War, and is still under stress today.
The ever-present fear for Disney is that, one day, a temporary business
slump will turn into a lasting thumbs-down for the company; that the mouse
and his minions will simply become out-of-date, part of yesterday's culture.
It almost happened under Eisner's predecessor, Walt's son-in-law Ron Miller.
He took over in 1966 after Disney died and guided the company through an
almost catastrophic 18 years.
Attempts to carbon-copy some imaginary work-slate of the founder's resulted
in insipid live-action feature films, like the endless adventures of Herbie
the Volkswagen, and low-energy animation features. But then, Disney's
popularity as a company has been swinging up and down, albeit less
spectacularly, ever since its first movie hit (Steamboat Willie in 1928).
Mickey and company were popular in the Depression-hit 1930s, out of favour
during the Second World War, back in favour in the squeaky-clean,
family-oriented '50s, and out again in the Vietnam-and-Watergate-battered US
of the '60s and '70s. In the 1980s, they were riding high. But the 1990s are
unknown and a menacing new millennium is just around the corner.
There is no shortage of Disney detractors world-wide to assist in the
company's descent from grace if ever they see it starting. In France, where
the Sleeping Beauty's palace has risen to stamp the Disney signature on the
skyline, there is dark talk of 'cultural Chernobyls.' The Minister of
Culture says he will not attend the theme park's opening, and Eisner had
eggs and tomatoes thrown at him during a crowd-wooing visit to Paris.
But no one should one be misled into thinking that Disney factionalism is a
matter of which side of the Atlantic you live. There are Disney-haters in
America, just as there are Disney fans - tens of millions of them -
throughout Europe. In Russia last summer, the Disney television shows were
top of the charts. In eastern Germany and Czechoslovakia, Disney comics are
fast outselling their (pre-liberation) rivals. Even in France, 10m children
read Le Journal Mickey.
Disney is now straining to please French adults, too. The design of the
Euro-Disney castle was inspired by a medieval illuminated book, Les Tres
Riches Heures du Duc de Berri, and the European roots of favourite Disney
legends are being stressed in the publicity literature.
In Christopher Columbus year, there is a slapstick reverse colonialism about
all this. Five hundred years after a European explorer founded the US we
would all soon know, if not love, an American mouse has brought New World
kitsch to a deprived continent. It seems unlikely - even on the company's
darkest days - that the mouse empire will go away, especially with new
bosses whose survival instinct is more ruthless than Walt's ever was. Says
Katzenberg, through visibly-gritted teeth: 'If we in the entertainment
business are a breed on the path to extinction, there is one thing I can
absolutely guarantee to you. We at Disney are the last ones going down.'

reduced budget

<TEXT>
ASK ANY restaurateur about the effect on trade of his customers' continued
financial restraint and he will probably just shrug his shoulders. In the
restaurant business, customers have been voting with their wallets for the
past nine months.
They have been doing so intelligently, often trading up at the same time as
reducing their monthly spending on entertaining. Couples who had allocated
Pounds 100 a month in their domestic budget for eating out would have
enjoyed two meals at Pounds 50 each. Now, many are choosing to go out just
once. But, to make it even more memorable, they are spending Pounds 70 to
Pounds 80. Thus, 25 to 30 per cent saved at a stroke - and still a great
deal of pleasure.
This has had two consequences. Those restaurants that are popular and priced
sensitively become even more in demand as customers stick to safe
destinations. And there are huge swings in business - one week a restaurant
can be very busy, the next week quiet - as overall demand falls.
Even those in the trade are now following their customers' new habits. A
leading hotelier from the West Country might come to London for a few days'
holiday. He will eat out as often as before, and in many of the same places.
But he will do so only at lunchtime, taking full advantage of the vast
number of good-value, set-price lunches on offer at virtually all London
restaurants and hotels. In the evening, he will go to the theatre.
The set-price lunch at a sensible price is (fortunately) here to stay and it
is something we must not feel ashamed to utilise - even if that means
telling your guest to save embarrassment. What restaurateurs must be forced
to realise - most effectively, by consumer demand  - is that a realistic,
fixed-price dinner menu would also be a great incentive. If the Department
of Trade and Industry could then find time to legislate for the inclusion of
the service charge in all prices, a meal out could be costed even more
accurately.
But there is one type of eating house which has been ignored recently and
which should be due for a surge in custom - the well-run neighbourhood
restaurant. Over the past few years, these have lost business to the more
glamorous competition in the city centres or the country. But as family
budgets begin to bite, these establishments will be able to offer an evening
away from the stove and sink - and all-round savings, too.

FT  11 APR 92 / Cookery: Stock answers - Make fine dishes finer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIPPA DAVENPORT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WRITING about high-speed soups recently, I reported on a blind tasting of
various brands of chicken stock. Quality varied considerably but none was a
patch on home-made. I was pleased about this because the home-made version
was my own. My morale would have taken a tumble if the results had been
otherwise.
I used commercial stock for the soups I devised for that feature. This, I
wrote, was done 'for the sake of speed.' That is nonsense, really, because
while stock takes considerable time to develop its flavour, the demands on
the cook's time are minimal.
Few things are easier to make than good stock, and few are more rewarding.
It makes a fine broth in its own right and it is a key ingredient in so many
soups, sauces, stews and braises. Its presence is capable of making fine
dishes finer, and of making ordinary dishes special. In fact, I can think of
no more vivid proof of the importance of good ingredients to good cooking
than preparing the same dish twice, one using commercial stock and the other
home-made. The difference is astounding.
Chicken stock is the most useful of all. My method of making it has become
simpler over the years. Gone are the celery, carrot, onion and bouquet garni
of classic stock recipes. For much of the year, celery seems all string and
crunch, too insipid to add any flavour. Carrots sometimes lend too much
sweetness, and the potency of onions is so variable. Sometimes, bouquet
garni is a wishy-washy nonentity. At others, it stings the cook's eyes and
may overpower the bird in the pot.
No - the plainer the stock, the better. If it is pure, the flavour stays
'true' in freezing; if it is concentrated, it will not take up much storage
space. In both cases, the cook's options are kept open. The stock can be
diluted as required and extra flavourings can be added.
The chicken stock I make has nothing but chicken, a little salt, and a few
peppercorns. Very occasionally, I add one extra ingredient (for cosmetic
purposes): the papery brown outer skin of an onion, which turns stock a
rich, consomme-like shade of bronze.
The Turkish-bath image of a kitchen swathed in the steam-heated
hubble-bubble of a stock-making session is pure myth. Stock is best cooked
very gently. If boiled fiercely, the fat bubbles through the liquid, making
it murky.
As for the old-fashioned practice of boiling stock every day to prevent
souring, that dates from the pre-refrigeration era Stock stored in a fridge
ought to be boiled every three days, but the most practical solution is to
put it in the freezer. There, if fat-free, well-reduced and salted only
lightly, it will months at least.
The most convenient portions for storage are from a quarter to a half pint.
As for containers, try the little plastic tubs with snap-on lids used by
delis and supermarkets for weighing and potting such things as curd cheese.
There is no need to plan ahead and thaw stock overnight before using it.
Just sit the frozen container in a bowl half-filled with hot water for a few
minutes. When the solid block of stock has been loosened, slide it out into
a saucepan and melt over a low flame.
And so to the chicken itself. The carcass left over from Sunday's roast is
perfectly adequate. Raw bones will yield more flavour, but how often do home
cooks bone-out a bird? To satisfy a household that gets through as much
chicken stock as we do, it is necessary to buy chicken specifically for
stock-making.
I use supermarket packets of chicken wings. While not cheap, they come with
a bonus. Wings are highly gelatinous, so the stock they produce is
satiny-rich in texture. This gives excellent body to sauces and soups and
sets to a solid jelly.
What is more, quite a bit of meat can be picked from the wings at the end of
stock-making and used to prepare a meal in its own right. More about that
next week.
PURE CHICKEN STOCK (makes at least five pints of very rich-flavoured stock)
The (minimal) effort involved is the same whether making a large or small
batch, so I suggest buying 6 1/2 -7lb chicken wings. Wash them, put them in
a large stock pot, add 6-7 pt cold water to cover, and bring slowly to a
bare simmer.
Add half a teaspoon of salt, a dozen black peppercorns (and, optionally, the
papery brown outer skin of an onion if you want a richly-coloured stock).
Cover and cook as gently as possible - the bottom oven of an Aga is ideal -
for at least four (and preferably six) hours. Only an occasional bubble
should wink at the brim. Fast cooking makes murky stock.
Set the pan in a cold larder for a few hours. Then, separate the liquid from
the solids, saving the chicken meat for other dishes. As soon as it is cold,
refrigerate the stock so that the liquid sets to a jelly under a blanket of
fat which can be scraped easily from the top.
Next day, scrape off the fat (the schmaltz of Jewish cuisine, which can be
used in place of beef dripping, lard or butter in cooking). Put it into a
small, covered container and store in the fridge.
Melt the jellied stock. If initial cooking was suitably gentle, and if all
trace of fat has been removed from it, the liquid should be as clear as a
classy consomme. Reduce it a little by fast boiling to concentrate the
flavour.
Add a little salt at the end to bring out the flavour, but not much as
freezing tends to heighten saltiness. It is wiser to season at the point of
using.
Cool, chill, cover and store in the fridge as much stock as will be used
within the next few days. Freeze the rest in small quantities.

FT  11 APR 92 / Wine: Cheap, but much more cheerful - Low-priced wines have
rarely been better value for drinkers on a budget
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANCIS ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE TIMING could hardly be better for wine drinkers determined to tighten
their belts without being bullied into reducing their consumption. Major
retailers are discounting madly, with the fruits of a run of lovely ripe
vintages on the shelves.
The effect of a revolution in winemaking and, increasingly, grape-growing
expertise has been to make expensive wine very expensive, medium-priced wine
twice as good value as it ever was, and cheap wine at least 10 times better
value than it was 15 years ago.
When modern technology invades a region's wineries, the first casualties are
heavy, flat whites and reds redolent of carelessly-washed vats and old
socks. They are replaced by oceans of fresh, crisp whites, often with traces
of the tropical fruit smells conjured up by low-temperature fermentation;
and light, crimson reds that might be a bit short of fruit and impact but
are indisputably clean.
They may not have that much character - but then, nor did Dr Jekyll in
comparison with Mr Hyde.
Most of the world's cheap wines today are competently-made liquids entirely
lacking the evils of the past, while also lacking many distinguishing marks.
But some producers at the bottom end of the market are now crafting wines
that have character as well as cleanliness.
This is great news for everyone, other than those who depend on selling
wines that cost twice as much but taste only 10 per cent better.
France, especially southern France, can offer the greatest range of flavours
with its host of idiosyncratic vins de pays. Cheap French wines tend to
taste rather drier than their counterparts from the New World, although
often this is because they are higher in natural acids and lower in ripe-
tasting alcohol than because they actually contain less residual sugar.
The great French saviour of the dry white wine market, for example, is so
tart that it usually needs the softening influence of a little unfermented
grape juice. Although the 1991 crop of Vin de Pays des Cotes de Gascogne was
much reduced, this is typical of a region managing to inject more and more
flavour into its once-anodyne whites. Domaine de la Hitaire 1991 (Pounds
3.99 at Davisons, which still stocks the 1990) actually shows good Sauvignon
and Manseng flavours while Oddbins White, from Domaine du Joy, exhibits
remarkable fruit for Pounds 2.99.
But France also can offer characterful reds with full Appellation Controlee
status for under Pounds 3 - such as Paul Boutinot's supple, spicy La
Falaise, Cotes du Ventoux 1990 (Pounds 2.75 Waitrose).
Eastern Europe is, however, now a much more varied challenger to France
under Pounds 3.50 with full, spicy Czech wines at Victoria Wine and
Hungarian Sauvignon and Chardonnay at Thresher/Wine Rack/Peter
Dominic/Bottoms Up. And Bulgarian reds are being seriously upgraded (try
their original importer, Bordeaux Direct of Reading).
Australia will continue to cook up special deals such as Killawarra pink
fizz (amazingly, only Pounds 3.99 at Oddbins) and still manages to pack much
more punch into a bottle than South Africa, however hard it tries to win
favour with foreign wine drinkers.
And then, of course, there are the huge Hispanics of the wine world . . .
they need to export, too.

FT  11 APR 92 / How To Spend It: Life's just as nice at a lower price - The
rise of Recession Chic
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCIA VAN DER POST
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN THE US, where, they tell us, everything comes bigger if not better, the
recession has triggered some serious role-playing. Even Julia Roberts, the
Los Angeles Times informs us, turned up at a Hollywood do wearing a
shapeless frock, no make-up and hair that looked as if she had cut it
herself. Not, you understand, that she doesn't have other frocks in the
closet, make-up on the shelves and hair that has been expensively given the
'no-cut' look - but appearances, it seems, are all. The Look is The Message.
Low-key chic is IN, never mind that economic lift-off seems to be under way.
Now that they are getting the hang of Recession Chic nobody seems inclined
to change tack just yet. Ripped jeans, no make-up, tangled hair are all the
rage. No need to fret and fiddle constructing the look yourself - buy it
off-the-shelf. A designer called Jim Trenton, who I guess at this rate will
not have to wear his own line for long, has taken the sweat out of the whole
business with his line of Poor Wear 'non-attitude clothing'. At America's
most revered store, Nordstrom, it is selling the way sequins used to sell
when they thought the champagne would never run dry.
Back here in the UK, where we never were quite so much into sequins and
glitter, the swings and mood changes are less marked. But almost everybody
knows somebody who is out of work, whose business has gone bust, whose
bonuses have been axed, whose expenses have been cut. Subtly, slowly,
attitudes have changed. Waste and excess have begun to offend. In circles
where once champagne was the most common aperitif, today it is probably a
New World sparkling wine; where once wardrobes were updated each season,
today serious thinking goes on before another designer number joins the
rack. Simpler pleasures are no less fun. Recession Chic has reached these
shores.
WITH PRICES at a top London crimper going through the roof (well over Pounds
50 seems par for the course) those who do not fancy the 'no-cut' unkempt
look could do what many a chic head does - book into a top salon at an
unfashionable time and let a trainee (under supervision, of course) do the
cutting. It is worth asking your hairdresser if he or she has a special rate
and time.
In London, for example, Schumi, 16 Pont Street, SW1 (tel: 071-235-3888) will
charge just Pounds 20 for a wash, blow dry, cut and conditioning if you come
(by appointment) between 10 am and 3 pm on a weekday and let a junior
stylist (overseen by Heinz Schumi) do the work. Molton Brown, 58 South
Molton Street, W1 has regular model evenings on Mondays at 5.45 pm when
trainees wield the scissors, but appointments can also be made during the
day. The price is Pounds 8 for a wash, cut and finish, but it usually
involves some hanging about.
Those with a good eye and time to browse can risk sifting through
second-hand shops and jumble sales, otherwise dress agencies do a lot of the
sifting for you. Doyennes of the dress agency world are Pandora at 16/22
Cheval Place, Knightsbridge, London SW7 (mostly mainstream designers such as
Chanel, YSL, in excellent condition, suits, dresses, ballgowns and
accessories at roughly half price, the seller gets quarter-price) and The
Frock Exchange, 450 Fulham Road, London SW6 (second-hand designer labels of
all ranges - Arabella Pollen balldresses at Pounds 80 as well as Next,
Jigsaw and good quality Marks &amp; Spencer). Sign Of The Times at 17 Elystan
Street, London SW3 has more adventurous labels like Joseph, Edina Ronay,
Zandra Rhodes.
Rokit, 225 Camden High Street, London NW1 specialises in vintage American
clothing mainly from the 1950s - chiefly patronised by the young or for
those looking for off-duty clothes. Look for original Second World War
flying jackets and 1930s Levis
The Designer Sale &amp; Exchange Shop, 61D Lancaster Road, London W11 sells
samples and seconds from the most recent season as well as second-hand
clothes. You need time and patience to sift through the range but is well
worth it.
The ethnic look that is currently so much in vogue is a great deal less
taxing on the purse than the plush silks and satins of the faded country
house school of decorating. However, it needs a little care to make sure the
house does not end up looking like a cheap and cheerful souk - and not all
ethnic shops are cheap.
Global Village, for example, is currently purveying a very sophisticated
ethnic look at prices to match, but Habitat is now looking much revived and
many of its wares are very affordable: thick, white wool rugs for under
Pounds 100, director's chairs for less than Pounds 20, and straight-backed
wicker dining chairs for Pounds 59 are all excellent value.
More good news for those furnishing on a budget is the opening next week of
The Pier at 200 Tottenham Court Road, London W1. Though there has been a
store in Richmond, south west London (now closed) for some time, the new
store is far bigger and more comprehensive and aims to bring authentic craft
products from around the globe to a mass market. When the shop opens (on
April 15) nothing will cost more than Pounds 400 (the price of a rattan
sofa).
Now that simplicity is the mood and swags and ruches are out of date, simple
cottons, tickings and muslins make dressing a window a much less expensive
affair. Many readers have found PN Jones Trading, Silk Merchants, of 18
Holly Grove, London SE15 an excellent source of inexpensive cottons,
cheesecloths, silks and cotton rep.
Though The Conran Shop, 81 Fulham Road, London SW3 is generally considered
by the impecunious to be out of their financial reach it is worth knowing
that the fabric department sports some marvellous buys - there is Indian
cotton khadi at Pounds 4.50 a metre, in beige or white, seersuckers at
Pounds 5.95, Supercot at Pounds 7.50 a metre and a plain oatmeal linen at
Pounds 7.95.
If you prefer your curtains ready-made then scour the auction houses for
textile sales. These often have marvellous fabrics which can be adapted to
fit your own windows (remember, of course, to go armed with all the
measurements you need and to examine the fabrics carefully before you raise
a hand.)
The Curtain Exchange is exactly what it sounds - a place where customers may
buy and sell each other's unwanted, cast-off curtains. What is available
depends on what has been brought in - it may be a pair of simple checked
gingham kitchen curtains or it could be a grand decorator's mistake.
There are now seven branches - two in London, at 133 Stephendale Road, SW6
and 54 Abbey Road, NW8 and ones in Boxford, Essex, Devizes, Wiltshire,
Cheltenham, Glos., Hurstpierpoint, Sussex, and Tarporley, Cheshire. If you
are selling you will get 60 per cent of the sale price; if you are buying
you will find some wonderful bargains.
Curtain Shuffle, at 194 Maxwell Road, Beaconsfield, Bucks, offers much the
same service. All curtains are guaranteed in excellent condition, sellers
get 60 per cent of the sale price and all sorts of ancillary services, such
as a valuation service and advice on cleaning. Alterations are also
available.
A chap lucky enough to be in a good job probably needs a good suit if he
wishes to hang on to it. While designer suits and M&amp;S may well pass muster
for many, for some there is nothing for it - a well-cut traditional suit is
essential kit. With a Savile Row suit these days costing an average of about
Pounds 1,200, it is worth looking at some of the other choices.
At Bernard Weatherill, 8 Savile Row, London W1X 1AF they are frank about how
hard the combination of the recession and uncertainty over the future of
hunting has hit them. 'We have had a very rough time,' says managing
director Hugh Holland, gloomily.
In an attempt to garner the patronage of successful young professionals, 'to
keep our workshops busy' the shop is reducing prices across the board. So
from now on you can order a pukka Savile Row suit for 17 per cent less than
before (for Pounds 1,000 instead of Pounds 1,200) and anybody who hunts can
have a hunting coat (made-to-measure, of course) for Pounds 725 instead of
the usual Pounds 1,000.
Timothy Everest is a tailor who works from an old Huguenot house in
Spitalfields - you walk through the door into a time warp and an older, less
expensive world.
For around Pounds 550 (depending on the fabric) Timothy Everest will make
you a proper bespoke suit. For Pounds 325 he will give you a made-to-measure
suit with slightly less handwork but still fitted and cut in the traditional
way. He is at 4 Princelet Street, London E1 (tel: 071-377-5770).
Henry Rose and John N Kent at 11 Old Burlington Street, London W1 (tel:
071-734-2687) are proper traditional tailors who will make completely
bespoke suits for about half the usual Savile Row price, largely by dint of
keeping overheads down, turnover high and profit margins low. Prices start
from Pounds 525 a suit.
Bertie Wooster of 284 Fulham Road, London SW10, which specialises in
second-hand clothes, now has a new venture - dealing in unclaimed bespoke
clothing. Hard times in the City have meant that unclaimed suits are
currently languishing in several august Savile Row establishments. Rather
than write them off completely they sell them to Bertie Wooster, which in
turn sells them to its customers. Prices range from Pounds 40 for a blazer
to Pounds 95 for a morning coat. City suits are somewhere around Pounds 75.
Redmayne is an old-establishd gentleman's outfitters which due to its
address (30 High Street, Wigton, Cumberland, tel: 06973-42221) is able to
charge reasonable prices for high-quality work. Bespoke, Savile Row-style
suits cost between Pounds 700 and Pounds 800 (fittings in Wigton, London or
Edinburgh).
A popular service, though, is for Redmayne to copy a favourite suit, stitch
for stitch, line for line, in a fine fabric of your choice for between
Pounds 350 and Pounds 400. From June 1 both services will be available to
customers in the US - ring John Underwood on 201-825-7800.

FT  11 APR 92 / Travel: Wild times when the Little Doctor cuts up rough -
Close to nature in Canada's northlands
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL WIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WILDERNESS travellers exchange the previously learned for the recently
learned. They go to new places to summon old reflexes, atavistic instincts.
Take Little Doctor Lake in the Nahanni range of Canada's largest and most
northerly province, Northwest Territories. Far across the expansive flats
west of the Fort Simpson Indian reservation rises a range of ancient white
mountains 70 miles long, towards the north end of which is a geological
anomaly.
The range has been cleft asunder so violently that the lake which bisects
the mountain range, Little Doctor, is over 700 ft deep. The lake is
lightbulb-shaped, the bulb spreading over the eastern tree-clad plains, the
neck sticking out the other side into the foothills of Canada's most
dramatic national park, the Nahanni.
Nahanni park is where I was meant to have been, goggling at the 5,000 ft
vertical canyons of the Ram river - deep ice- rimed caves strewn with
10,000-year-old mountain sheep carcases - and that mad canoeist's
dream-fantasy, the Virginia falls, a waterfall that dwarfs Niagara in
height.
But rigid scheduling is inimical to Canada's outback. My host was a province
away fighting forest fires (a civic obligation in Canada's northlands), and
my 12-year-old son and I were swooping down on to Little Doctor equipped
with those two wilderness necessities, a latch-key and a bag of groceries.
The cabin stood off the water-edge in the trees. A rough lawn had been sown
in front, on which stood a skin-drying rack. Flensing instruments made of
bone and spades hung on the wall.
Two boats were hauled up, one aluminium with a 20 hp outboard, the other a
two-man pink canoe. The facilities included an outdoor 'long-drop' toilet,
three gas canister cooking-rings, a table facing the lake, shelving, and a
loft in which squirrels were busy disembowelling the insulation (later they
turned on our supplies).
As the floatplane's engine droned into silence, a new wave of sounds flowed
in. Unconsciously, I began sorting one from another: the rusty bickering of
the squirrels, the gentle belling of a blood-hungry mosquito, splashing
lakewater, then, at 4am, a bear crashing through the undergrowth.
The nearby sandbar was a visitor's ledger of recent traffic. Here were
footprints from the big moose, such a heavy animal that even below the
waterline its deep treads persisted a day later. The bear's deep-digging
claws were unmistakeable. Beavers had lopped trees and saplings randomly,
and along the surf-edge were dragonfly corpses and the bodies of little
silver minnows.
The neighbourhood wanted to know who this addition to the community was,
dropped unceremoniously from the sky. The black bear which strolled by in
mid-afternoon had my son springing off the porch. The bear sniffed
scent-traces on the trees unhurriedly with his large and finely-tuned
proboscis, his fur gleaming glossily in the sunlight.
At dawn a female moose materialised on the water-edge over the glassy lake,
looking our way. We boarded the canoe, wobbled furiously about, then
commenced a slow approach. The prehistorically-proportioned animal stood
broadsides, occasionally flapping her frond-like ears, small eyes gazing
steadily as we slid up to her. She tore foliage off the saplings and her
hind leg lifted to scratch her flank in complete unconcern.
That first day, nature swarmed at us thick and fast. The haunting cries of a
great northern diver echoed round the water, and then he surfaced so close
by our paddles that I could see his red eye. Sandpipers apparently fearless
of man skittered in front of our boots on the spindrift.
We paddled into the forbidding chasm, awesome cliffs on one side and a shale
apron below rock ramparts the other, to get a closer view of the mysterious
Dall's sheep. These shy, white, high-legged mountaineers eke out a living
above the treeline.
They say in Canada: If you don't like the weather, wait ten minutes. But you
seldom have to wait so long. High winds and instant waves hit the millpond
calm with push-button suddenness. The temperature of over 100` F on the
first day fell to 44` F by the second.
The chasm turned into a choppy maelstrom, the wind pushing along the whole
face of the Nahanni bluffs, funnelling into that one outlet, capable of
throwing a boat in the air. Once we used the big motorised boat and in spite
of flat calm only half-a-mile away, the chasm was roughing up nastily second
by second, with grit off the rockface stinging our faces.
This country produces its own characters, shapes them. On a lake further
north a hardened bush-hand spent his living ferrying mail-order wives into
his isolated cabin. One begged to be released after a single day; a more
stalwart candidate visited for two summers. I met 92-year-old Gus Kraus, a
strong-shouldered fur-trapper who knew the ways and foibles of wolverine,
beaver, otter, muskrat and lynx; also of marten, of which he used to catch
up to 300 in a season, at their peak valued at CDollars 1,000 (Pounds 485) a
pelt.
He recalled hooking pike out of the lake of over 40 lbs, and shooting them
with a .22 as they came into the shallows. Little Doctor, he told me, was
called by the Indians Moving Water Lake, because of its deceptive current
and freak winds.
Then there is the legendary, recently-deceased Albert Faille, a mechanic
obsessed by the fate of two early prospectors found bound together without
their heads, who left notes claiming to have found gold on the Nahanni
river. Faille struggled for eight weeks upriver through the sheer Nahanni
canyons and stayed for several years, an almost superhumanly arduous trip
performed eight times, lastly aged 72.
His determination was kept alive by once having located the gold, a bonanza
aborted when a woodpecker ate his prospecting map. The Nahanni park's
pristine emptiness and untouched grandeur may owe much to that woodpecker.
We were evacuated, as it turned out, by the last aircraft that could have
reached Little Doctor for several days. Clouds came down, rain came in, all
in a season (August) usually clear and fine. Our bush senses were not tuned
to red alert, but they had stirred.
From the UK, visits to Little Doctor, together with canoeing and rafting
trips in the Nahanni park - anything, in fact, except finding the gold - can
be fixed through Alistair McLean at Accessible Isolation Holidays, Midhurst

FT  11 APR 92 / Travel: Travelling modestly in troubled times - You don't
have to spend a fortune on travel
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCIA VAN DER POST
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THIS IS not my first time in India, writes Lucia van der Post. I have been
before, a five-star traveller, sequestered from the heat, dust and crowds by
air-conditioned rooms and luxury buses, by meals in Taj Mahals and Oberois.
This time is different. I am here to look at work projects among poor
communities. Our food and accommodation will be paid for out of charitable
funds and will be modest.
I only begin fully to realise what this means when I learn that for our
group of nine there are just three rooms available at our first stop in
Delhi. I lose my nerve and stay with a generous friend in the city.
The India International Centre, where the group is staying at about Pounds
12 a night, turns out to be the most luxurious stop of the tour. Next door
to the Lodi gardens, to stay there is, it seems, a privilege conferred only
by being sponsored by a member.
We soon learn that with the rupee at about 44 to the pound, everything,
except internal flights and the top hotels, seems cheap. It is not long
before we are spending like spoiled princelings. We wander down Chandni
Chowk market, buying up khadi cotton tops in rainbow colours at Pounds 1.50,
hand-embroidered cotton tablecloths from Madras, silk scarves from Orissa,
wall-hangings from Rajasthan, wooden toys from Bangalore, beads from heaven
knows where. The rupee is getting stronger by the minute.
Lunches are taken on the hoof - bunches of flavoursome bananas, baskets of
oranges and coconut milk, all at under Pounds 1 a head. One day we treat
ourselves at The Gaylord on Connaught Place - lassi, biriyanis, kormas,
tikkas, naans, as much as we can manage for less than Pounds 5 each.
On our last night in Delhi, the group dines modestly in the club. I join my
generous friend and an international banker for dinner in a grand hotel. In
the middle of the night I am stricken - I reach for the Immodium and somehow
make it on to the plane for Bangalore. The rest of the group is in splendid
health.
In Bangalore we stay at the Ashraya, an Indian-style middle-ranking hotel.
Here I have my first encounter with cockroaches. 'Don't worry,' say my
companions, 'in the upper East Side in New York they can't get rid of them
either'.
I do the first of my room swaps and become acquainted with washing,
Indian-style. Based on the (no doubt sound) principle that it is unhygienic
to sit in dirty water, you either stand under a shower or contrive to use
the large bucket and small jug that is provided to get clean.
In Mysore we stay in the cheapest hotel of the trip. The Park Lane, at 2720
Curzon Park Road, costs Rs80 (just under Pounds 2) a night. I am very
fragile, and even the grey colour of what I think were once white sheets is
not enough to stop me falling gratefully to sleep. I am woken by shrieks
from next door as my companions meet their first cockroach.
In time we come to love the Park Lane. We take up the entire hotel and in
the shady courtyard we chat, drink lime sodas and lassi, and those who are
well eat plates of vegetable sizzlers for Rs25. Later, when I am well, I
dream of those vegetable sizzlers . . .
Every day we find new pleasures that cost little or nothing. Every village
has its market but the one at Mysore is special. We spend a morning there,
stunned by the sounds, smells and images. Just being there is enough.
We learn that the needs of modest travellers are very different from those
of five-star travellers - ear plugs (Indians seem impervious to noise and
nothing cheap is ever quiet), bath plugs and toilet paper are essentials.
Clean pillowcases, baby-wipes, water-biscuits and Marmite (for when you are
feeling fragile) are optional extras.
Near Vellore we have our loveliest day among rural villagers who are poor
but seem not to feel it. We look at their basketwork, visit houses, are
fascinated by the vitality and evident happiness of the children, eat supper
in the community centre and ponder why it is that they smile more often and
more sunnily than anybody we know.
In Madras there is a mini-rebellion. Even sweet-smelling roses cannot
console two of our number - the peeling wallpaper, more grubby sheets, a
cockroach emerging from the water-biscuits, the noise from the Nungambakkam
High Road has them almost in tears. A bottle of (Indian) champagne in the
Connemara hotel and a flit to three simple but clean double rooms with
bathrooms (Rs250 a night) in the Residency Centrepoint Guest House at 167
Kodambakkam High Road (gleaned from the modest travellers' bible, Lonely
Planet's Travel Survival Kit, India, Pounds 13.95) did the trick.
Modest travellers should budget for occasional treats. Some of us were ready
to kill for a bacon sandwich. I began to hallucinate about a cold glass of
Chablis and a salade Nicoise.
But what about the poor, I hear you say, how did you cope? I am left
fumbling for something adequate, or at least not banal, to say. We bought
bundles of small rupee notes and learned to be discreet about giving. In
Bangalore, overcome by the sight of a blind young man, the age of my son,
shuffling across a street, I pushed some notes into his hand. Out of nowhere
came a hideously deformed beggar, and then another . . . and another. I gave
them all the notes I had and still they came.
I cannot do better than quote Mark Tully's opening words in his new book (No
Full Stops In India, Viking, Pounds 16.99) about how his guests cope with
the poverty. They 'expect the taxi-drivers to take them back to their hotels
whatever hour of the night. Before leaving, they will check the fare with me
to make sure the taxi-drivers do not get a few more rupees than they are
due.'

FT  11 APR 92 / Travel: Travelling modestly in troubled times - You don't
have to spend a fortune on travel
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL THOMPSON-NOEL

<TEXT>
DETERMINED to celebrate the UK election result? Or worried by recession?
More cheerful this morning - or less?
Paradoxically, the well-heeled traveller has never had so many luxury
hotels, gold-card safaris or state-of-the-art cruise ships from which to
choose - recession or no, writes Michael Thompson-Noel.
But perhaps you have vowed to economise on holiday costs this year. If you
have, there is plenty on offer that is reasonably priced without sounding
tacky.
Never one to leave its rooms empty if it can help it, Hilton International
has been wracking its corporate brain for intriguingly cheap offers.
Birdwatching weekends? But of course. Hilton UK has launched a choice of
weekend breaks for bird-spotters based at seven UK hotels and one in
Holland, hosted by experts.
For example, there is a three-night May bank holiday break at the Hilton
National, Swansea, May 22-25, incorporating visits to Skomer Island and the
Gower coast, at Pounds 175 per person. And there is a four-day package at
the Amsterdam Schipol airport Hilton, starting August 28, which costs Pounds
275 each, including the ferry.
Hilton also recently launched its Weekend Hilton Style short-breaks brochure
with prices starting at Pounds 42 per person per night. With an eye to the
times, Hilton has introduced a special-offer hotline to give details of late
availability.
Perhaps you live in London. In which case, a really cheap holiday could be
spent in London's Docklands. This may come as a surprise, but in the view of
the London Docklands Development Corporation: 'Docklands is already
established as an important tourist destination, attracting an estimated
3/4 m people each year.'
Scandic Crown Hotels opened a 390-room hotel at Nelson Dock in Rotherhithe
last year, and Britannia Hotels opens a four-star hotel on the Isle of Dogs
next month. There are new restaurants and pubs, and the RiverBus is
introducing a weekend service from today, two new piers (St Katherine's Dock
from Monday and Canary Wharf from early May), plus three new catamarans
between now and June.
David Powell, LDDC's tourism manager, says: 'A new market is being opened up
on both sides of the Thames east of Tower Bridge as visitors come from all
over to see what is considered to be the largest and most successful inner
city regeneration programme in the world.'
If you seriously want to travel cheaply, your best bet is probably The Good
Bed and Breakfast Guide, newly-published by the Consumers' Association and
Hodder &amp; Stoughton.
Since the last edition, say the editors, a significant number of b&amp;b's have
moved up-market. There have been substantial price rises, but also increased
comfort.
Generally, though, b&amp;b's are still good value, and some have kept their
price rises below inflation. Most cost less than Pounds 30 a night. The
guide lists prices and number and types of room for about 1,000 b&amp;b's, many
of them, it says, in particularly attractive settings.
If you want to venture further afield, scan the classifieds or Oracle, or
visit a good travel agent, for there are plenty of deals and discounts
available.
To quote one at random, Sally Holidays' motoring short-break-of-the-month
for April is a one-night jaunt to the Chateau de Montvillargenne in
Chantilly which costs Pounds 144 for two people, including dinner (with
wine), breakfast and return ferry crossing. The Pounds 144 relates to
self-drive trips between Sunday and Thursday nights. Extra nights' b&amp;b cost
Pounds 46 for two.
In addition, Sally Holidays has just produced a new brochure of European
short breaks, with prices starting at Pounds 55 per person for a one-night
hotel break and two-night breaks starting at Pounds 67. The idea is to
explore less well-known towns and country areas. The brochure has a wide
choice of accommodation in hotels, inns and auberges in France, Belgium and
Holland.
Because the travel trade is still under great pressure, there are plenty of
special offers going, many based on late availability. Among travel
companies, Hayes and Jarvis's prices are as competitive as anyone's.
Current H&amp;J examples: Egypt: seven nights b&amp;b in the Luxor Novotel for
Pounds 299, second week free, or a seven-night Nile cruise for Pounds 379,
second week in the Luxor Hilton free (departures every Thursday, May and
June, Gatwick or Manchester).
Kenya: seven nights half-board at the Shelly Beach Hotel, Mombasa, for
Pounds 299, 14 nights h/b Pounds 399 (depart Sundays, April and May, Gatwick
or Manchester). Malaysia: seven nights room-only at Ferringhi Beach, Penang,
for Pounds 499, second week free, or seven nights r/o in the classier
Casuarina Beach Hotel, Penang, for Pounds 599, second week free (depart
Wednesdays and Sundays, April and May, Heathrow).
All these prices are per person in a twin room and are subject to
availability. Hayes and Jarvis's special offers also cover Gambia, Thailand,
Sri Lanka, Antigua, Jamaica, Barbados, Grenada, Tobago and Brazil.

FT  11 APR 92 / Minding Your Own Business: An old craft faces modern
economics - Editions Alecto, which painstakingly reproduces historical
hand-coloured prints
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICK GARNETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN A somewhat rundown six-storey former bag warehouse in the London district
of Hackney, machines like giant mangles press sheets of paper. The printer,
wearing a white apron, is surrounded by inks, cloths, and rather
primitive-looking tools. While the image is a little Dickensian, the
economics are not. One large set of paper sheets generated by this seemingly
antiquated workshop recently sold for Pounds 150,000. And the presses are
not churning out banknotes.
Printer Edward Edgerton-Williams and his studio work almost exclusively for
Editions Alecto, a tiny family-owned publishing house claiming to be the
only one in Britain producing limited edition, hand-coloured prints from
18th and 19th century plates etched and engraved with historically important
images.
These include sets of prints of the plants collected on Captain Cook's first
voyage around the world in 1768-71, all produced from the original copper
plates made in the 1770s. Others are the bison and Red Indian-strewn prints
made from the original plates depicting the 1830s travels, in north America,
of Maximilian of Wied-Neuwied, a German prince with a taste for exploration.
Exact facsimiles in the original Norman, Latin and English of the Domesday
Book are also in 'production,' using modern lithographic printing
techniques. Almost all of Editions Alecto's work is done in close
collaboration with the museums which own those plates and manuscripts.
Operating from its own gallery in a beautifully converted former dairy in
Kensington, the company has made a very handy living for Joe Studholme and
other members of his family. The company generated sales last year of Pounds
1.5m on which it made a pretax net profit of Pounds 144,000.
'We started off in the early 1960s publishing the works of contemporary
artists,' says 56-year-old Studholme. 'Our first historical series was
William Daniell's Voyage Round Great Britain for the Tate Gallery. I
actually did that because I thought it would be a wonderful peg for hanging
a modern series on to. Since then, we've rather got to like historical
series.'
The Studholme family are the sole shareholders, though for Editions Alecto's
next project - reproduction of prints of the Tales of Chaucer held in a
Californian museum - the company is seeking shareholders who will pay
Dollars 100,000 (Pounds 57,803) for a slice of the project's profits. Big
numbers are nothing new for the company. The North American prints (Bodmer's
America, from the name of the Swiss painter) are on sale at Dollars 80,000
for the set of 81 engravings. All the 100 sets of Banks' Florilegium - 740
engravings of the plants collected by Joseph Banks, later director of Kew
Gardens, on one of Captain Cook's voyages - have been sold, though one
version of final proofs is on offer at Pounds 175,000. The most expensive of
the Domesday Book editions, encased in ancient oak, bound in goatskin, is a
snip at Pounds 7,500.
The company's biggest cost is printing, reflecting meticulous preparation
and reproduction. The steel or copper plates, usually unused for more than
100 years and suffering acid damage caused by the environment and their
protective wrapping, must be restored.
Ink is made from tinned products and dried pigments, mixed with boiled
linseed oil and rubbed into the etched or engraved lines.
The plate is then placed face-up on a press bed and specialised paper is
placed on top. The press forces the paper onto the plate, pulling the ink
from the etched lines. After each roll through the press, each plate must be
cleaned and re-inked.
Then comes the hand water-colouring. For Bodmer's America, 90 per cent of
the work involves water-colouring, each print absorbes four to 14 hours of
hand-colouring. The final master proof for each print is inspected by the
museum owning the plates and stamped once it is satisfied.
There is a high chuck-out rate. 'I would say that, last year, 300 out of the
2,000 prints we did failed on our own test and had to be shredded,' says
Edgerton-Williams. It can also be very time-consuming. 'It took us between
400 and 500 hours restoring one plate, the male turkey in Audobon's Birds of
America. It took over 200 hours of proofing work to get the image right for
Dog Dancer in the Bodmer series.' The Banks' Florilegium project took ten
years to complete.
Administration costs are high. The publicity and exhibition budget is over
Pounds 100,000, and, though Editions Alecto's permanent staff is just eight,
scores of specialists are hired on temporary contracts. More than 50
scholars were involved on the Domesday project. The Domesday Book, a
massively detailed survey of land and asset holdings carried out under the
orders of William the Conqueror between 1085 and 1087, excites Studholme,
who studied history at Oxford.
'It was an incredible bureaucratic feat. We now think just one scribe was
used who was English, because he wrote with the English open 'e'. The
correcting scribe, though, was a Norman looking over his shoulder. The first
scribe didn't quite finish it. The section on East Anglia was published
separately.'
The third largest cost is royalty payments to the museums. This can run to
'a few hundred thousand pounds' for one series, Studholme says. Usually,
agreements with museums prevent publication for 50 years of any other
editions from plates used by Alecto.
Because the number of sets per series is so small (100 for Banks'
Florilegium, 1,000 for the Domesday Book, with a further 1,000 separate
county editions) Alecto only requires a small number of customers. About 40
per cent are museums and public libraries. Most of the rest are wealthy
individuals interested in botany, exploration or printing. Some also buy as
an investment. The price of Florilegium has risen from the original Pounds
45,000 to Pounds 150,000.
'It's a funny business, really,' says Studholme. 'The things we produce may
be wonderful but you yourself have to visit people who show an interest. You
can't sell it through the mail.'
A large chunk of customers are in Australia and the US.
The company has retained its level of sales over the past few years, but the
recession has hurt. 'It has shrunk the market enormously, though
temporarily. Museums have had their acquisition budgets slashed and private
donors are not making up for it. We've sold 30 of the Bodmers but by now we
were expecting to have sold another 30 out of the 125.'
A number of projects are under consideration, apart from Chaucer. One is to
combine CDs with videos in educational and entertainment packs based on the
company's various series of prints and the Domesday facsimiles.
'We are very keen to do this because so far we have not been successful in
developing a bread-and-butter part to the business,' Studholme says. 'We
want to exploit the intellectual property rights we hold.'

FT  11 APR 92 / Minding Your Own Business: Cottage industry communicates fax
of life - New technology and a new idea beneath a thatched roof deep in the
Devon countryside
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE FEWINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TELECOTTAGES are a simple idea. Fill a room in a country dwelling with a
mass of telecommunications equipment and advanced business machines, then
watch small businessmen and local community members fall over your stable
door in the rush to use the kit beneath the thatch.
In practice the idea has failed to spread: most of the 20 or so functioning
telecottages spread over the UK occupy odd corners in schools, colleges and
public libraries.
Only one, according to Mick and Maggi Waltho, is actually a cottage - with
roses round the door. 'All we lack is a thatched roof,' joke the Walthos,
whose mid-Devon telecottage, in a deep lane in the hamlet of Penstone, five
winding miles from Crediton, celebrates its first year in business last
month.
It all started three years ago when, as a result of their marriage, Mick and
Maggie found themselves with two cottages, one in Penstone and one in nearby
Colebrook. The alternatives, when they combined their families, were to
continue letting the 'spare' cottage as a holiday property, or selling it,
or using it for some other purpose.
Mick, who is 42, had worked for Post Office Telephones and then British
Telecom; he was already earning his living from his front room doing systems
work and computer consultancy, bringing in about Pounds 10,000 a year; he
was just able to service the remaining Pounds 42,500 mortgage and support
the two of them and their three children, aged eight, six and one. Maggi had
a background in marketing.
With an additional loan of Pounds 15,000 to renovate and convert the
telecottage, the Walthos calculated that they could just afford to spend a
year living off their savings while starting up the project. Forty pounds a
week for 12 months came from the Enterprise Allowance Scheme. Mick was able
to do some more consultancy work while they were setting up. Maggie worked
as part-time barmaid at a local pub, and took some secretarial work: this
brought in about another Pounds 2,000. There was also some rental income
from the last few months of letting the 'spare' cottage to holiday visitors.
The Walthos, who put all their Pounds 18,500 liquid assets into the scheme,
had an early stroke of luck when Canon UK and Bonsai Computers agreed to
support the venture in kind. Both offered concession prices on the purchase
of computers and photocopiers, while BT provided practical support in
setting up the project. By March 1991, with overheads totalling no more than
Pounds 13,000, they were ready to go.
The scheme attracted the attention of a computer consultancy in Okehampton,
a dealership in Tiverton, a CAD specialist in Bovey Tracey and the East
Devon College Information Technology Centre.
'We saw such a network as an umbrella under which telecottages and
organisations with some overlapping interests could pool resources, share
skills and workloads and use as a means of marketing their services,' said
Mick.
Another advantage he saw in a Devon teleworking network was that it might
provide a series of 'work centres,' where visiting businessmen could call
and pick up faxes, electronic mail or other data. The plan is that,
ultimately, the network should act as a sort of clearing house for business
information and equipment, the cost shared by interested parties.
The official launch of the telecottage last October introduced Devon
Teleworking to representatives of local businesses, councils, industrial
development bodies and the local media. Transferring most of their equipment
to a nearby hotel, the Walthos demonstrated access to the European Community
database, Prestel, advanced audio conferencing by satellite and desktop
publishing, to an assembly of local farmers, BT boffins and college
lecturers.
They were also able to link up with some of the other members of the
proposed Devon Teleworking network, and beyond. 'Since then it has been all
go,' said Mick. 'We expect to turn over between Pounds 90,000 and Pounds
100,000 in our first financial year."
The Walthos have been offered a trial contact with Reuters, the news agency,
which has an historical text scanning and indexing operation in nearby
Tiverton. And this month Maggie hopes to become the new Colebrook and
Penstone post mistress - a position that has been vacant since the previous
post office closed in 1990.
'We have also been asked by Post Office Counters Limited to be the community
post office for the villages round here, and this should provide a valuable
source of regular base income for the telecottage,' said Mick, who plans to
be his wife's assistant behind the counter. 'The first proper job I had when
I left school was behind the counter at Southall post office. So, in a
sense, it be back to square one.'

SINCE RETIRING I have written short stories and a novel as a hobby. I have

sale, which is greatly exceeded by the postal and typing costs I have
incurred in pursuing my hobby. How should I proceed taxwise?
If you were engaged in writing the story in question for more than two
years, you can claim to be treated as having become entitled to the recent
payment in three instalments:
one: two years before the actual payment date;
the second, a year before the actual date; and
the third, on the actual date.
If - as seems more likely  - it took you less than two-years-and-a-day, you
can claim to be treated as having become entitled to the payment in two
instalments:
one, a year before the actual date; and
the other on the actual date.
This relief is available under section 534 of the Income and Corporation
Taxes Act 1988.
In a reference library, look in the index of one of the larger tax books.
under 'copyright, assignment'. In anticipation of further sales, ask your
tax office for the free pamphlet IR28 (Starting in business).

MY FATHER had two children by his first wife: my sister and me. After a
divorce, he had an illegitimate son, Michael. My father recognised Michael
as his son, but made no contribution to his upbringing. He then married
again and had another son, John.
My sister died in 1978, leaving three adult children. My father died in
1982. He left the whole of his estate, approximately valued at Pounds
130,000, to his wife. He wife died in 1986, leaving everything to her son
John. Neither my sister, myself nor Michael were in any sense dependent on
our father for financial support.
Do my sister's children, myself and Michael have any claim on our father's
estate?
Any opportunity you might have had to seek an order of the court for
maintenance out of your father's estate has long since lapsed. Claims under
the Inheritance (Provision for Family and Dependants) Act 1975 have to be
made within six months of probate. It seems likely that any such claim would
have failed in any event.

There is no inheritance tax (formerly death duties) chargeable on gifts made
by one spouse to the other. Hence the use of joint ownership to save
inheritance tax is only relevant between spouses where it is intended to
make a gift of a part or all of the half share of the first to die to
someone other than the surviving spouse. A formal transfer or conveyance
into joint names (to hold as tenants in common in equity) can be used, or a
declaration of trust followed by the appointment of a new trustee.

MY father-in-law died recently, leaving deeds of a small garden in the joint
tenancy of himself and his widow. The widow is 87, so the title of this land
will obviously pass to someone else. To facilitate the transfer of this land
by gift or sale will it be sufficient merely to place my father-in-law's
death certificate with the deeds, indicating that the widow is the sole
owner? Or will it be necessary to complete other formalities? There will be
no inheritance tax to pay, as the estate is small.
What you suggest will be adequate to establish the title of the surviving
joint tenant provided that there has been no severance of the joint tenancy
during the lifetime of your father-in-law.

written in Spanish and English and signed before a Spanish notary. He has
done this.
Some years ago I made a will in Britain appointing the solicitors acting for
me to be the executors and trustees. On re-reading this document I am
unhappy at the amount of licence the executors and trustees would have with
my capital.
My estate is small. There is no property. The total cash value is about
Pounds 35,000. I would like the money to be collected into a Jersey deposit
account, the interest from this to be paid to my husband during his
lifetime. After his death the money would be divided between my two nieces.
English solicitors seem reluctant to make such a simple will and want to put
in extra clauses.
If you are no longer domiciled in England you can revoke the English will
and leave your Spanish will to take effect. So long as you have no immovable
property in the UK a will valid under the law of your country of domicile
will be effective to dispose of your estate.

DIRECTORS of Micro Focus have been selling again. This time, however, it is
not the entire board - merely the two largest shareholders reducing their
stakes, and realising a total of more than Pounds 8m. Shares in Micro Focus
have been an outstanding investment since the turn of last year.
Brake Bros operates in the frozen foods industry, but specialises in supply
to the catering trade. One of the brothers, William, has sold 455,000 shares
at 428p. He retains 7,118,255 shares, marginally less than his brother
Francis, managing director.
Prominent among the purchasers this week is John Ritblat. Often regarded as
one of the shrewdest judges in the UK property market, Ritblat heads British
Land. His purchase of 250,000 shares suggests a degree of confidence in the
sector which has not been evident elsewhere. He has taken his holding to
almost 1.4m shares.
Bernard Wheeler, a non-executive director of Bimec Industries, has been an
active dealer in Bimec shares. Having bought 100,000 shares at 41p in
February last year, he sold 900,000 shares at 70p only six months later. Now
he has re-invested some of that cash by buying 100,000 shares at between 48p
and 49p.

FT  11 APR 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Can the battered Tokyo market recover?
 -The risks of investing in Japan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
BRITISH PRIVATE investors should confine any Japanese equity purchases to
the 'risk' element of their portfolios.
It may well be that the bullish arguments advanced by some fund managers in
Emiko Terazano's piece (left) prove to be correct, although many experts
were also arguing that Japanese shares were cheap when the Nikkei index was
at the 22,000 level.
But with price-earnings ratios in the high 30s, Japanese shares are
effectively valued at three times the ratings of British shares.
Before the crash of 1987, it was frequently argued that p/e ratios were
irrelevant to valuing Japanese shares. The British investor, however, has a
right to be cautious about such arguments. The rewards of backing Japanese
shares at current levels could be high, but so are the risks.
Anyone prepared to take the plunge should opt for a collective fund which
can provide the diversification and investment expertise necessary for an
overseas market. There is a wide range of Japanese unit and investment
trusts to chose from. There are 87 specialist Japanese unit trusts and a
further 51 Far Eastern funds which include a Japanese element.
Of the Japanese-only funds, a number have managed to produce consistently
above average performance. The following are in the top half of the sector
over one, two, three, five and seven years: Baillie Gifford Japan; Baillie
Gifford Japan fund; EFM Smaller Japanese Companies; James Capel Japan
Growth; Schroder Tokyo; and Stewart Ivory Japan. Schroder Tokyo is the top
performing fund over 10 years; and its Smaller Companies fund is top over
three, five and seven years (although it has slipped in the past year).
The strength of smaller companies shares has told against the indexed funds
but some investors might be tempted by the tracking funds from the likes of
James Capel and Morgan Grenfell.
There are six specialist Japanese investment trusts of which Baillie
Gifford's Shin Nippon has done best over three and five years; GT Japan is
the top performer over seven years.
All the collective funds have suffered in tune with the Tokyo market in the
1990s. No Japanese unit or investment trust showed a gain over one or two
years; only six funds managed a profit over three years. The average unit
trust in the area is down 28.5 per cent over three years, even with income
reinvested.
Only over 10 years can the real benefits of Japanese investment be seen,
with the average unit trust showing a gain of 321 per cent (offer-to-bid
with income reinvested). That compares with a 301.7 per cent rise from the
average UK Growth fund.
Most Japanese trusts are not really suitable for Personal Equity Plans.
First, the rules limit such non-EC PEPs to Pounds 1,500 per tax year.
Secondly, yields tend to be low in this area (the average for the investment
trusts is just 0.8 per cent). The income tax savings are therefore likely to
be low and those who can only invest Pounds 1,500 in a tax year would not
expect to face capital gains tax difficulties.

IN SPITE OF yesterday's 7 per cent jump in the Tokyo stock market, recent
sharp declines have battered confidence and left investors holding Japanese
stocks shell-shocked.
With the Nikkei stock average 57 per cent off its peak in the late 1980s,
the main question is whether the time is ripe to buy Japanese stocks, or
whether share prices have further to fall.
The Nikkei stock average is at levels last seen in the mid-eighties, the
period before the 'bubble' of asset inflation in the stock and real estate
markets in Japan began. Considering the strength of the economy and
corporations, a further fall in share prices could make Japanese stocks look
cheap.
Most fund managers and brokers agree that shares are fairly valued at
'pre-bubble' levels. The bottom for the current decline is projected in the
13,000 to 15,000 range and many predict that a rebound of the market will be
sharp.
Some fund managers believe that the scope for Japanese shares to fall far
from current levels could be limited. Harry Lange of Fidelity Investment
Management in Tokyo says the actual risk in buying shares has significantly
reduced. He adds that it is safer to buy than to wait for a rebound, since a
recovery, once it starts, could be quick.
However, given the pessimism prevailing in the market, it will take courage
to jump in. Andrew Ballingal of Barclays de Zoete Wedd in Tokyo warns that
the Nikkei average, which has gone from one extreme of late 1980s, may fall
to the other - as low as 12,000  - in the next few months.
On the other hand, Ballingal says that, since there will be little time to
jump in once a rally starts, investors should start considering buying at
current levels and buying on declines. On a 12-18 month view, buying shares
below the 20,000 level should offer favourable returns.
Looking at economic fundamentals, the 'doomsday scenario' of the Japanese
economy put out by some pessimists may be overdone. The Japanese economy
grew 3.2 per cent in the fourth quarter of 1991 and most economists do not
expect a negative figure for this year.
Employment grew by a year-on-year 2.3 per cent last month, and the
unemployment figure is low at 2 per cent. Profits at Japanese industrial
companies are expected to pick up from the middle to the year. According to
Chiharu Shima at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, profits for 300 listed companies
(excluding financials), are expected to grow 1.7 per cent for the fiscal
year ending March 1993.
The main culprits of the recent falls in share prices are the bank and
speculative issues. The plunge in bank stocks seems to represent continuing
asset deflation in Japan's financial and real estate markets.
Bank stocks were heavily bought in the past few years as they were seen as
leading beneficiaries of the sharp rise in stock and property prices in the
late 1980s. The popularity was supported by heavy unrealised gains on
cross-holdings and increased profits from property related lending.
However, falls in the stock and real estate markets have undermined the
banks' capital value, and most financial institutions face a rise in bad
debt from real estate related loans.
As in the UK and US, the problems the financial institutions face will
probably take time to solve. However, the end of the asset speculation, also
represented by the sharp declines of speculative issues, will mean a
healthier stock market.
'The market is shedding the excesses, and seeds for a healthy stock market
are been sown,' says Chris Grubb, general manager of Jardine Fleming
Securities in Tokyo.
The fall of the Nikkei is the third, following those in April and October
1990. Three of the four post-war bear markets experienced three sharp
downswings followed by rapid recoveries. If the pattern repeats itself, the
market could rebound in the near term.
The Nikkei could see further declines within the next six months but, with
the US stock market looking overvalued and European markets facing higher
interest rates, on a mid-term view, some argue that Japan is worth
considering.
Jason James at James Capel in Tokyo says that, since Japanese industrial
shares are at their cheapest levels against US and UK counterparts for 20
years, buying Japanese investment funds weighted in the manufacturing
sectors is a wise choice.
The price-to-book ratios, which indicate a company's share price relative to
its net asset value, have fallen sharply for industrial blue chip companies.
For example, the consolidated PBR for Nissan, the car maker, is at 0.83,
while for Hitachi, the electronics group, the figure has fallen to 0.91.
Small companies, which tend to grow faster in a recovery and potential
beneficiaries of structural changes and deregulation, may also offer
favourable returns, according to some experts.

FT  11 APR 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Zeros lead investment trusts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RECENT investor enthusiasm for split capital investment trusts may seem
justified by tables comparing share price performance.
Over three years, the two best performing shares have been zeros, which have
benefited from positive and negative factors. On the plus side has been the
fall in interest rates, which causes zeros, like bonds, to rise in price. On
the negative side, the poor performance of stock markets in general has led
investors to seek the relative security of zeros. Zeros pay no income but
have first claim on the assets of the trust when it is wound up.
Over seven years, two of the top five performers have been income shares,
which were helped by strong dividend growth (until 1991-92) and by private
investor demand. Income shares usually involve the risk of capital loss as
the trust approaches maturity.
Indeed, the chances are that whatever the market circumstances, some kind of
split trust shares would be top of the listings. Were we to see a sharp bull
market, then capital shares would top the tables.
The problem for the private investor is to divine which class of split trust
shares is set to profit. Buying the wrong class could result in very poor
returns. Capital shares have fallen by an average 20 per cent over the past
three years, for example. But some might believe that this week's
Conservative victory will herald a revival in capital share prices.
Those who prefer to buy trusts with a simple structure have done best to
keep their money overseas. The average UK general trust has fallen by 4.9
per cent over three years, compared with a 25.2 per cent rise for
international general trusts. Over seven years the figures are more evenly
balanced - 119.6 per cent versus 136.7 per cent  - but still favour the
internationalists.
Some geographical specialists have done even better. Wall Street's strength
has meant that American trusts are best over three years (an average 52 per
cent rise) with far east (excluding Japan) trusts proving to be the top
geographical sector over seven years (a 227.1 per cent increase).
Overspecialisation can be risky. Investors in the Korea Europe fund, for
example, have suffered a near 57 per cent decline over the past three years;
the Singapore SESDAQ fund is 42 per cent down since April 1989. Many of the
European single country funds have fallen by 25 per cent or more over the
last two years
The international general trusts have the benefits of greater stability. The
sector average shows positive returns over one, two, three, five and seven
years. Experts tend to agree that such trusts are the first port of call for
the private investor.
Top international trust over seven years, with a rise of 211.5 per cent, was
Law Debenture, with Bankers second and Foreign &amp; Colonial third.

FT  11 APR 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Investment fillip for Peps
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PERSONAL EQUITY PLANS underwent a volcanic shift this week, even though the
nation opted for continuity.
From the start of this week, investors have been allowed to fill a Pounds
6,000 Pep with unit or investment trusts (unless the trusts have a
predominantly non-EC content, in which case the maximum Pep investment
remains Pounds 1,500).
Fears about the election seem to have moved many investors to do so - big
houses such as Fidelity, Save &amp; Prosper and Invesco MIM all reported that
business had been much brisker than usual for the first week of the tax
year.
Those who bought a Pep this week, on the apparently muddled thinking that it
was a good idea to dive into equities immediately before a Labour government
took power, will now be feeling rather smug.
Yesterday's elated stock market reaction, however, has not dampened many
analysts' expectations of strong equity gains in the next nine months. And
that makes the opening offer discounts available from some managers all the
more enticing.
Schroders and Fidelity are offering a 1 per cent discount on unit trust Peps
until May 29. Scottish Widows has a similar discount until April 30 in a
range of three Peps.
The tax advantages of Peps mainly apply to those investing in income, but
'Recovery' or 'Special Situations' trusts, which aim for capital growth, may
appeal to those who believe that the economy will now grow sharply. The
combination of tax advantages, low charges, and the broader diversification
of unit trusts, means that fund managers now have a potent alternative to
life assurance-based products.
Understandably, fund managers rushed to offer their new Pounds 6,000
collective investment Peps, with one, Schroders, even managing to make an
announcement within an hour of the chancellor's speech on Budget day itself.
As Pounds 6,000 unit trust Peps are relatively cheap for managers to run, a
sharp increase in Pep marketing by life insurance companies can be expected.
The new Peps should have a number of advantages over the existing range of
life assurance products such as single-premium bonds and endowments, on
grounds both of performance and tax-efficiency, so this move should be
welcome.
However, this does not necessarily mean the death of the existing 'top-up'
Peps, where managers offer investors their maximum Pounds 3,000 in a unit
trust, and then supplement this with an extra Pounds 3,000 held in a 'pot'
of complementary equities.
Robin Berrill, managing director of Henderson, points out that most people
who want to put Pounds 6,000 into an equity-based investment in one year
would want the extra opportunity of holding some direct equities in any
case. But he accepts that demand for top-up Peps will be reduced to some
extent.
His company is offering the '3-Way Pep' for 'sophisticated' investors. This
allows an equally spread Pep invested in unit trusts, investment trusts and
direct equities, or 100 per cent in either a unit trust or an investment
trust.
Marketeers might now try to sell plans as a financial planning tool, and
package them in different ways. Peps could, for example, be packaged for
school plans, or, in conjunction with term assurance, for backing up
mortgages. Attempts to do this have so far largely been unsuccessful, mainly
because direct equities are, rightly, perceived as a risk investment. Now,
more strenuous Pep marketing can commence.
The ability to fund Peps through regular savings is also central to this new
appeal, which explains why one measure in the small print has infuriated
managers and could, they say, significantly dampen demand for this form of
long-term saving.
Keith Crowley, marketing director of Invesco MIM, one of the market leaders,
was angered by the Inland Revenue's ruling that, from now on, all long-term
regular savings plans held in a Pep should be formally renewed, with full
documentation from the saver, each year.
He thinks this could have a 'very negative impact' on the market for Pep
saving plans, which have a tough battle against endowments, which are less
tax-efficient but still heavily sold.
Crowley points out that the chances of losing Pep accounts through 'inertia'
are great, and that investors who have only held a plan for one or two years
could be left with small, inefficient holdings.
The Unit Trust Association also lobbied hard for a change to this rule.
Julian Shersby, of the UTA, said: 'It would be impossible to have the money
coming in via a standing order, but leave the fund manager with no authority
to invest it in the plan until a signature had been obtained.'
The Revenue relented slightly after hearing such complaints, and the rule
will not now come into force until the beginning of the next tax year
(1993-94). But it still wants to keep the rule, to guard against savers
fraudulently taking out more than one Pep.
Plan managers are likely to continue arguing for a change in the rules. They
are wise to do so. Now that they have at last been given the opportunity to
show that they can deliver tax-efficient long-term saving vehicles, it would
be a pity if this administrative glitch knocked them back.
Market conditions are now favourable. And even over the last ten years,
collective trust savings schemes have beaten life assurance endowments.
According to figures from Micropal, if you had invested Pounds 50 monthly
for ten years in the Law Debenture investment trust, the investment would
now be worth more than triple the total money paid into it. If held in a
Pep, no CGT would be paid on it. Law Debenture, an independent international
general trust managed by Touche Remnant, is the best performing investment
trust savings scheme.
Meanwhile, endowment returns look less healthy. Pearl Assurance, which led
last year's Money Management survey of endowments over ten years, is now
offering a pay-out of Pounds 7,561 for those who have saved Pounds 3,600 in
premiums - only just doubling investors' money.
It would be a pity if administrative red tape barred the way to the highly
efficient saving which Pep savings schemes now offer for another five years
to come.

FT  11 APR 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Now cheaper mortgages are in sight
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BARCHARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE TORY victory has brought a huge sigh of relief in the world of mortgages
and savings products. Bank and building society mortgage customers can look
forward to slightly lower interest rates in the next few months than they
would done had Labour won, and further falls over the next 18 months.
'I think the result means that the housing market will pick up reasonably
briskly. I am not expecting a boom, but there will be a much more positive
environment than there has been for the past few months,' says Duncan Grant,
chief executive of the Household Mortgage Corporation.
John Wriglesworth, housing analyst at City stockbroker UBS Phillips &amp; Drew,
also says he expects a recovery in the housing market in the second half of
this year and a further fall of about 1 per cent in base rates by the
year-end. And he forecasts a rise in house prices next year of up to 6 per
cent.
More generally, banks warned that the rise in the markets after Thursday's
Conservative triumph might not be sustained for long. 'I think it will fall
back in due course,' says Peregrine Banbury, head of investments at Coutts,
the private banking arm of the NatWest group.
It is the savings side of their business which worries the building
societies. During the past few months, they have been vulnerable on several
fronts. Rates have come down and they are now facing competition from gilts.
Before the election, some funds were going offshore. Worst of all, they face
a serious challenge from National Savings.
'There have got to be level playing fields. If the return on National
Savings is dictated by things which are nothing to do with the markets, but
reflect the government's need for cash, we are going to face a very
difficult time,' says one society.
Because a Conservative government probably will need to borrow less than
Labour would have done, and because there will be some more privatisations,
the threat from National Savings might not be as great as it could have been
under Labour.
Even so, the building societies are looking forward anxiously to July when
the Guaranteed Bond is to be introduced. They believe the bond - which has
an advantage of about half a percentage point - will be marketed strongly by
the government. To bridge that gap, several top societies were muttering
before the election about a rise in rates on their savings products.
Alastair Begg, joint managing director at Kleinwort Benson Private Banking,
said he thought the election result would not make much difference for many
people. But the prospect of relative certainty in the markets, and a gradual
revival in the housing sector, should be good news for most homeowners.
Savers may not see such high interest rates - but they could be safer from
inflation than they would have been under Labour.
And yet, as one senior banker said on Friday: 'I still worry that in a few
weeks all the euphoria will have disappeared but all the problems of the
economy will still be with us.'

FT  11 APR 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Beware - loan sharks about]
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AS BANKS and building societies become increasingly tight-fisted in the
recession, some people may be tempted to look elsewhere to borrow.
Advertisements - sometimes promising 'fast, sympathetic service'  - are
likely to catch the eye of those up to their neck in debt. But these are
companies preying on the weak, according to the latest issue of Which?, the
Consumers' Association magazine.
Which? found some brokers charging as much as Pounds 1,000 to arrange a
Pounds 5,000 loan. One company charged Pounds 499 on a Pounds 2,000 loan,
leaving the borrower with only Pounds 1,500 in cash. Commissions paid by
lenders and brokers varied from 2 per cent to more than 10 per cent of the
loan amount. According to Which?, the greater the debt problems of the
borrower, the more commission the broker gets.
It found many interest rates were double those offered by high street
lenders - and some were extortionate. One couple with mortgage arrears
thought they had agreed to a re-mortgage but had, in fact, been given a
four-month bridging loan of Pounds 18,000 at an APR of 51.1 per cent. The
loan included fees and interest of Pounds 5,520, leaving the couple with
only Pounds 12,480. Another company offering a loan of Pounds 2,500 charged
an APR of 40 per cent, compared with around 16 per cent from high street
lenders.
The association says one reason for the existence of the loan sharks is the
ease with which operating licences can be obtained from the Office of Fair
Trading. A Which? researcher acquired a licence as a credit broker after
sending Pounds 70 and filling an application form which required neither his
employment history nor references.
The Consumer Credit Act contains 'extortionate credit' provisions which
allow consumers to take lenders to court over allegedly unfair credit terms.
But only 15 cases have been decided so far - and only four have been won by
the consumer.
The OFT says this is because the courts have tended to concentrate on the
credit charges without addressing abuses in the way such loans are sold. It
has proposed several changes to the law, including replacing 'extortionate
credit' by 'unjust credit' to cover unfair business activity. Another change
is to empower the OFT to initiate legal action on behalf of the borrower.
The association welcomes the proposals but calls on the OFT to be tougher
when licencing and policing credit brokers.
It advises those who are worried about their financial situation to contact
their local Citizens' Advice Bureau or to telephone the National Debtline
(021-359-8501) for confidential advice.

THE outlook for UK construction stocks should become clearer next week with
several major companies announcing final results for last year.
Recession in the housing and construction sectors is expected to take a
toll, with losses, provisions for property write-downs and dividend cuts
expected. But the market will also be looking for signs of improvement.
John Mowlem, the construction group which also owns 90 per cent of London
City Airport, is expected to announce on Monday pre-tax profits of Pounds
10m, down by more than two-thirds. The company's scaffolding subsidiary had
a poor first half. A dividend cut is expected.
Taylor Woodrow, which has suffered badly in both property and construction,
is expected to do no better than break even (against Pounds 83.4m pre-tax
profits a year earlier) on Tuesday. Heavy provisions and possible write
downs on its property portfolio, are expected, although the dividend is
probably safe.
RMC, the world's biggest cement maker which reports on the same day, is
unlikely to surprise with pre-tax profits down one quarter to Pounds 160m.
Strong performance in Germany is likely to buffer the company from a weak
UK.
Tarmac, the UK's largest housebuilder, looks likely to cut its dividend when
it reports a plunge in profits on Wednesday to around Pounds 35m (Pounds
190.7m). The company is expected to make a Pounds 12m provision on the
Channel Tunnel, and a possible land write down.
Blue Circle Industries, the building materials group, announcing the same
day, is expected to be in much better shape and to limit profits fall to
Pounds 126m (Pounds 195m). The dividend should be maintained.
Smiths Industries, the aerospace and medical equipment maker, is expected to
turn in interim pre-tax profits of around Pounds 45m (Pounds 50.7m) and an
unchanged interim dividend of 3.9p on Wednesday.
Investors will be keen to hear whether Smiths is closer to sewing up a
partnership agreement with Collins Avionics, a division of Rockwell
International of the US.
The UK's struggling hotels will take the limelight on Wednesday when both
Forte and the Savoy Group report full-year results. Forte is expected to
announce pre-tax profits sharply down from 1990's Pounds 190m, with
estimates ranging from Pounds 73m to Pounds 78m. The Savoy could drop from
last year's Pounds 10.3m to Pounds 2m. The coming year should be much
better, particularly with the prospect of an upturn in business travel after
the UK election outcome.

FT  11 APR 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: House sale shortfalls stifle job moves
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARBARA ELLIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MILLIONS OF homeowners are facing the serious threat that they will have to
sell their houses for less than the size of their mortgages. On even the
most optimistic forecasts, job mobility could be stalled seriously until
almost the end of the century if lenders insist that all mortgages are
redeemed fully at the time of a sale. But lenders do not seem to have
arrived at any common policy on how to handle this severe problem.
In London, the south-east and East Anglia, people who bought at the top of
the 1988 price boom may have to wait another five years at least before
seeing the same level of nominal prices, according to Gary Marsh, house
price specialist at the Halifax.
Paradoxically, it is much more expensive to move previously-mobile young
people than older people with longer-established mortgages. 'A lot of people
at the moment are sitting with a mortgage that is more than the house is
worth and they don't have the benefit of relocation,' says Vic Thomson, of
Hambros Countrywide.
How do lenders react when their borrowers are faced with a shortfall? Some -
particularly those likely to have a high proportion of borrowers affected -
downplay the situation. Others recognise an increasing difficulty and admit
resorting to solutions they would not have considered a few years ago.
Meanwhile, insurers appear to be trying to cut mortgage indemnity losses by
interpreting policy terms more flexibly.
Lenders have discussed the shortfall problem among themselves, although the
topic has yet to figure on any official agenda, according to Adrian Coles of
the Building Societies Association/Council of Mortgage Lenders. 'There is
every sympathy with borrowers but no solution,' he says. 'Effectively, it
means people are stuck.'
Coles says lenders would not halt sales willingly by refusing to release the
deeds on a property. 'There is no problem if people don't want to move and
are continuing to pay the mortgage,' he adds. 'But this is a factor
inhibiting recovery in the housing market and reducing labour mobility.'
The three largest lenders, the Halifax and Nationwide building societies and
the Abbey National bank, have targeted first-time buyers repeatedly. These
are the people most likely to be caught in the cleft between high percentage
borrowing and falling property prices. But all three refuse to estimate how
many sales are falling short, apart from saying that the number is very
small. They insist that the only solution is for borrowers to stay in the
property until the mortgage can be redeemed in full.
When pressed on options, such as covering a deficit to an unsecured loan,
both the Halifax and Nationwide retreat into vague generalities about
considering each case on its merits and taking all circumstances into
account. The Halifax drew attention to its Pounds 7,500 limit on unsecured
loans and suggested that people moving because of a job change would be
helped out by their companies. Ambrose McGinn, marketing manager at the
Abbey National, said the bank did not offer loans to pay off loans.
The Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester building society said its deficiency sales had
increased significantly. After agreeing 21 for the whole of last year, the
society is now processing a few applications every day. A spokeswoman
stressed that cases were treated individually, with examination of the
marketing history of a property. Borrowers wishing to move who stayed with
the society could be offered the amount of the shortfall as an unsecured
loan at the same rate as their next mortgage. However, the society would
stick to its 95 per cent mortgage ceiling on the new property.
Kevin McGinnis, of the Bradford &amp; Bingley building society, says it would
sometimes give borrowers the chance to pay back the deficiency over a period
of years, effectively as an unsecured loan. 'In the past, we certainly never
would have done something like this.'
Lenders may get help from mortgage indemnity policies in shortfall cases
although, strictly, the standard terms cover losses only on sales after
repossession. Eagle Star said most insurers would now examine such cases and
could agree to pay out if they felt they would lose less than by going
through an entire repossession.
The insurer would still have the right to pursue the borrower for the
shortfall. But Eagle Star said this would not be done in cases of extreme
hardship or where it was not worth powder and shot.
For individual borrowers, relocation with a job could be the best hope of
escape. Thomson says he is seeing increasing cases of shortfall sales,
generally ranging from Pounds 2,000 to Pounds 15,000 (although the worst, in
Cambridgeshire, had run to Pounds 70,000 and resulted in a company
withdrawing the offer of a move for an employee). 'There is no clear
answer,' he adds. 'Nobody seems to have thought that house prices would ever
go down.'
Thomson said employers were arguing with the Inland Revenue, on behalf of
employees, that making up a shortfall should not be treated as a taxable
benefit. They would then offer either an interest-free loan or a lump sum
payment to cover the deficiency.
If you have now outgrown the house you bought four years ago, but cannot
sell without a loss, it looks as though you are probably on your own. But
the moves some building societies are making provide some glimpse of light
at the end of the tunnel. For the time being, you have nothing to lose by
putting your case forcefully to your lender.

FT  11 APR 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Making waivers - Improving a company's
position
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID HARRIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IMAGINE that you are a director of a small company which has been refused
further financial assistance by its bank. You are not in a position to issue
(or to purchase) loan stock or further shares, and you do not wish to damage
the share price by refusing to declare a dividend. What can you do to
improve the company's financial position over the short term?
If you have sufficient personal funds to meet your day-to-day living
requirements, you can take less out of the company (thereby leaving more
within it) by waiving dividends or remuneration, or loans outstanding to you
from it. However, some attention must be given to formality and timing in
order to avoid undesirable tax consequences.
A waiver is, effectively, a refusal to accept payment; it cannot redirect
the dividend to other parties. Funds which would otherwise be paid over are
then made available to the company for other purposes. Dividends. A dividend
can be waived validly only before the right to it has arisen. In general,
this happens on the date of declaration (or on the date it is to be paid, if
that is later). So, any waiver must certainly be made before the date of
payment and, preferably, before the date of declaration.
There are tax implications. You do not pay income tax on a dividend once
waived, unless the effect of the waiver is to increase payments by the
company to family members.
A dividend which is waived within 12 months before the right to it accrues
is not treated as a gift for inheritance tax purposes. A 'standing' waiver
should, therefore, be renewed regularly in order to take full advantage of
this exemption.
No advance corporation tax (ACT) is payable by the company on a dividend
which has been waived. This will increase the amount of cash available to
the company - particularly if it is unable to set off the ACT against
mainstream corporation tax on profits, for example, because it is making a
loss or has insufficient UK profits.
There is no effect on the VAT position of either the company or the
shareholder because both payment and waiver of a dividend are outside the
scope of VAT unless payment in some form or other is received in return.
To waive a dividend, you must sign and date a written document specifying
the dividend payment(s), and the shares to which it relates.
Remuneration. Any waiver of wages, fees or salary must also be made before
the right to them has accrued. You do not pay income tax on waived income
and it is not deductible by the company when computing its profits.
Provided no deduction is made by the company, the amount waived is not
treated as a gift for IHT purposes.
Loans. Other income to which you may be entitled from the company could
include a loan which you have made to it. Since a loan is a debt due to you
as the creditor, it forms part of your assets for inheritance tax purposes
unless repayment is validly waived.
The Capital Taxes Office of the Inland Revenue will accept a waiver only by
document under seal. Strictly speaking, this involves fixing an adhesive
wafer to the document.
In practice, though, if the document bears the printed words 'signed, sealed
and delivered,' and contains your signature plus an indication of where to
place the seal, it will be acceptable.
There will be no liability to capital gains tax on the waiver of the loan if
you are the person who lent the money to the company originally.
Waiving your entitlements from the company may be a highly tax-effective
method of short-term finance. It may also enable the company to make future
payments of dividends and remuneration which are sufficient to compensate
you for the amount you have had to forego.
David Harris is managing director of chartered accountant Chantrey
Vellacott.

implementation of the measures announced in Norman Lamont's Budget. For
those who, punch-drunk with election claim and counter-claim, have forgotten
the essential measures, we print below a summary of the key provisions. Most
have already passed into law; the last few will need renewed legislation.

of taxable income.
Basic rate and higher rate taxes unchanged at 25 and 40 per cent
respectively. The threshold for higher rate tax is unchanged at Pounds
23,700 of taxable income.
The married couple's allowance will be frozen at Pounds 1,720 this year.
Single person's allowance increased, with inflation, from Pounds 3,295 to
Pounds 3,445.

Single pensioners on income support will get an extra Pounds 2 per week;
married couples an extra Pounds 3 from October.
Pensions cap will rise from Pounds 71,400 to Pounds 75,000
The capital gains tax threshold will rise, in line with inflation, from
Pounds 5,500 to Pounds 5,800.
The annual limit on unit and investment trust personal equity plans (Peps)
will be raised from Pounds 3,000 to Pounds 6,000.
Measures the government can now enact
The threshold for inheritance tax will rise by more than inflation to Pounds
150,000.
The married couple's allowance will be payable to either partner, or they
can have half each, from April 1993.
Owner-occupied farmlands, farm tenancies, interests in un-incorporated
businesses, and holdings of over 25 per cent in unquoted and USM companies
will be exempt from inheritance tax. Relief from inheritance tax at 50 per
cent will apply to controlling holdings in fully quoted companies, holdings
of under 35 per cent in unquoted and USM companies, interests of landlords
in let farmlands and certain other business assets.
The rules on mortgage rescue schemes using the business expansion scheme
will be eased, and the BES for trading companies will be scrapped from the
end of 1993.
Minimum charitable gift eligible for gift aid relief will be lowered to
Pounds 400, not Pounds 600

FT  11 APR 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Soften the sting of redundancy - How
to ease the financial burden if you become surplus to requirements
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Conservatives have won the general election during a recession that is
already the longest Britain has suffered since World War Two. And although
there are indications of an upturn in the economy later this year,
unemployment is expected to rise further. As a result, many more people are
likely to face acute financial difficulties.
These changed circumstances are not confined only to those at the bottom of
the income scale. Many professionals, particularly those in the City, have
been made redundant. Others who still have a job are all too aware that
their future is uncertain. But for people worried about meeting their bills,
there are measures that can be taken.
Draw up a budget. While this sounds obvious, it is essential. You must have
an idea of your disposable income and where it is going. Financial planners
suggest breaking it down into essential spending (mortgage, utility bills),
marginal (needing a new washing machine or car), and dispensable (holidays,
newspapers). Try to remember direct debits for which you no longer have a
record but which are leaving your account at regular intervals; you could be
paying for non-essential goods or subscriptions. The budget is also useful
if you intend seeing your mortgage lender to negotiate reduced payments.
Reduce your debts. This might sound demanding at a time when you fear a loss
of income, but take the chance while you can afford it to pay off debts that
charge high interest such as store cards, credit cards and overdrafts.
This is also not the time to buy a house you can only just afford, or to
take on long-term, inflexible investment policies.
Take out redundancy cover. This is pricey but could be worth it if you think
you are in serious danger of losing your job, since it will cover your
mortgage payments for a time. Unfortunately, the recession has meant that
lenders have been making these policies more expensive while reducing the
length of cover.
Robert Noble-Warren, of fee-based financial adviser Murray Noble, says the
cheapest time to take out cover is when you arrange a mortgage. Typically,
this adds up to 2 or 3 per cent of your monthly mortgage repayments from a
bank or building society, but as much as 6 per cent from a broker.
Peter Smith of Hill Martin, a fee-based adviser specialising in retirement
and redundancy planning, advises shopping around for cover. He also suggests
checking the policy to make sure that it is not confined to specific
situations (for example, you might find you have to resign) or whether it
applies only to those drawing unemployment benefit, for which you might be
ineligible.
If you are about to be made redundant, consider the following:
Terms of redundancy. You might think you have no control over this but Smith
emphasises that, if you are a senior employee, your employer's desire to get
you off his books means you could well find your redundancy conditions are
highly negotiable.
Smith says you should refuse to be pressured into signing anything until you
have had time to marshal your arguments. It is worth consulting a solicitor
who specialises in this area, particularly if you feel your redundancy was
unfair, because the construction of the final package will have legal and
tax implications.
Redundancy pay. Only the first Pounds 30,000 is tax-free. If you are sure
you have enough income from savings, you could consider asking the company
to pay amounts over this level into your pension scheme; this way, you avoid
paying tax on them. But this can be done only by your employer.
Otherwise, if your outlook is uncertain, the best way of investing the money
is in an instant-access, high-interest bank or building society account. If
you are married, ensure you use up both personal allowances.
This is not the time to tie up cash in insurance bonds or endowments unless
you are sure you have enough income to sustain you until you find another
job. A fee-based financial adviser should give unbiased counsel; most
independent advisers earn their living through commission on the products
they sell you.
Unemployment benefit. If you are a redundant professional, it might not
occur to you to register as unemployed. But there are two advantages in
doing so. You will not have to pay National Insurance contributions and
could draw unemployment benefit if eligible. But it is not worth registering
if you are 55 or over, since your pension would be offset against benefit.
Smith advises those who think they might be eligible for sickness benefit
not to register as unemployed. Unlike unemployment benefit, sickness benefit
is not taxable and is transformed into a disability benefit after six
months; this can also have an earnings-related supplement.
Pensions. Do not allow yourself to be sold a personal pension unless you are
sure it will be to your advantage, warns Smith; he says you could be
substituting 'final salary certainty for a money purchase hope.' The
alternative is to leave your pension with the company and take it as a
deferred pension.
If you do leave a company scheme which provided you with life cover and
permanent health insurance, you will need to take these out yourself until
you find a new job. Those who are ill or smokers could find this expensive,
but Smith points out that you might be able to obtain continuation cover
from a company scheme, in which case you would not need to have a medical.
This has to be done before leaving the scheme or within a month of it.
If you have share options, you will need to exercise them within a similarly
tight time frame.
Mortgages: Since the Tories came to power in 1979, mortgage debt has gone
from about 30 per cent of personal disposable income to more than 70 per
cent. This is the largest monthly commitment for most people and, unlike the
clothes or food bills, cannot readily be reduced. If you are worried about
payments, the Building Societies Association advises you to see your lender.
What it decides will depend on the level of your difficulties. The most
common solution, according to the BSA, is to accept lower monthly payments -
sometimes by as much as 50 per cent.
But those with endowment mortgages are likely to find these inflexible in
such a situation. The endowment gives bad value if cashed-in early, so try
not to surrender it if this can be avoided.
If you are in dire straits, your lender might suggest taking a share in the
value of the house in exchange for lower monthly payments. The disadvantage,
of course, is that you will no longer be entitled to all of any future
growth in value.
In the worst case, you might have to consider a mortgage-to-rent scheme.
These vary between lenders; but a common method is to sell the house to a
housing association, enabling you to become a tenant and to qualify for
housing benefit.
You could be eligible for income support to cover mortgage interest
payments, but you must be out of work to qualify. Usually, this would pay
half the monthly interest for the first 16 weeks of unemployment and the
full amount after that.
Savings and investments. In general, it is better not to touch longer-term
investments, such as endowments or five-year National Savings schemes, since
your return for early surrender will be low. Unit trust or investment trust
savings plans normally can be stopped without penalty. Cancel the direct
debit and notify the company that you are stopping the scheme temporarily.
If you cannot afford your 25-year endowment policy but it has run for more
than seven years, you might get a better return by selling it to a
marketmaker or at auction rather than surrendering it to the insurance
company. Check first with the company how much the surrender value would be,
and compare this with the auctioneer's reserve value.
If you do not want to encash it but cannot afford the premiums, your lender
might allow you to take a premium holiday; otherwise, you could consider
making the policy 'paid-up' - in which case you would pay no more and wait
for the amount invested already to mature.

FT  11 APR 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Slimline Next is back from the brink -
The Bottom Line
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DAVID JONES, chief executive of Next, has lost 2 1/2 stone on a diet. When
reporting results earlier this week he was worried that analysts would think
his new lean look meant that the fashion retailer was still suffering.
In fact, the results he announced were greeted in the City with gasps of
amazement. Analysts confessed to being surprised, even speechless, when they
saw the pre-tax profit of Pounds 12.3m, compared with their estimates of
about Pounds 8m to Pounds 9m.
They were all the more impressed when they discovered that the figure was
struck after a depreciation charge Pounds 4 1/2 m higher than normal. Given
that a year earlier the group had reported a Pounds 40.7m pre-tax loss, the
recovery was sharp.
However, Next, like Jones, is a shadow of its former self. In the year ended
January 1988 it made a pre-tax profit of Pounds 92.4m. Before the October
1987 crash it had a market capitalisation of Pounds 1.3bn and was a
constituent of the FT-SE 100 index.
In many ways Next epitomised the rise and fall of the stores sector in the
late 1980s - rapid expansion in UK high streets, acquisitions, share issues,
and above all a high profile chairman and chief executive in George Davies.
Profits rose; the share price followed.
But 1988 marked the turning point. By December of that year Next was warning
of a 'significant' drop in profits. a few days later, Davies was sacked.
As the consumer boom slackened and the financial consequences of
over-expansion in high-rent shops with expensive fittings became apparent,
Next and many of its retail compatriots found profits turning to losses. In
the 1990-91 financial year the group reported a net loss of Pounds 222.8m.
The company's story over the last year has been one of climbing out of the
abyss. It had one lifeline to cling to. One of Next's most ambitious moves
had been the Pounds 300m purchase of Grattan, the mail order group, in 1986.
Although Grattan's value had fallen, Next was able to sell it in March last
year for Pounds 167.5m in cash.
That deal secured Next's balance sheet, so that it was able to meet the
redemption of two convertible Eurobonds this year with cash to spare. The
group also set up provisions to cover the costs of rationalising the
business.
Then it was a matter of revitalising the company's brand name. New designers
have improved the product range - and their success in enticing customers to
buy was seen in sales which rose by 12 per cent in the second half of the
financial year. That was achieved without resorting to pre-Christmas price
cuts.
Over-expansion had spread the Next name too thinly, with too many different
fascias - such as Next Originals, Next Too, and Next for Men. So far 100 of
the 414 shops have been closed. Lord Wolfson, chairman, says that soon all
the shops will have one standard fascia.
At the same time the group had to cut the high level of occupancy costs it
suffered when shop rents rose sharply in the late 1980s as retailers vied
for new stores. Lord Wolfson says that the group's rent as a proportion of
sales including VAT were now 11 per cent, compared with a 'very high' level
before.
He believes that the group has completed more than a third of the task of
rebuilding. It gets harder from here, but there is a momentum running in
Next's favour.
However, the remaining question is how far can Next recover. One analyst
says: 'I now believe Next does have potential.' Another remarks that 'it
shows how operational gearing really works and how cash generative retailers
are'.
Lord Wolfson believes a company such as Next should be able to make an
operating margin of perhaps 7 or 8 per cent. If the company's sales can
recover to Pounds 500m, from the Pounds 392.9m its continuing businesses
reported, the profit target could be about Pounds 37.5m. That may take a few
years to achieve.
On forecasts of pre-tax profits of between Pounds 18m and Pounds 22m for the
current year, and the shares closing the week at 82p, up from its 63p
opening on Monday morning, the rating is rapidly catching up with events.

FT  11 APR 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Cleaning up after the party - Serious
Money
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Personal Finance Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IF YOU recently sent all your money in a brown envelope to a Panamanian
bank, you can ask for it back now.
After all the panics, after all the marketing hype from financial services
companies, Labour failed to win the election. The 50 per cent tax rate and
the abolition of the National Insurance ceiling are proposals now consigned
to the dustbin of history.
It all goes to show how dangerous it is to plan your finances on the basis
of hypothetical situations. I only hope that readers did not race to invest
their capital in ill-thought out Business Expansion Schemes or high-charging
Personal Equity Plans through fear of Labour. Such haste may prove to have
been expensive.
The investments we were highlighting in the event of the Labour government -
Tessas, National Savings, index-linked gilts  - will still be highly
attractive under a re-elected Conservative administration.
It also seems likely that investors can afford to be more confident about
equities than they would have been under Labour. However, the normal caveat
applies: you have to invest for the long term. While the markets may have
been in euphoric mood yesterday, there are still problems in the economy
which have not gone away.
It is far from clear that the recession is over, and the eventual recovery
may be sluggish. Profit and dividend increases from the UK corporate sector
may be limited. Even those companies with overseas businesses may find their
progress limited by the unhealthy state of many world economies.
The recent problems of the Japanese stock market may also have repercussions
on UK equities - and there are also doubts about whether the recent highs on
Wall Street can be sustained.
Having said all that, UK equities still look reasonably valued in historical
terms. Even after yesterday's rise in the market, the yield on the All-Share
Index is still close to the long term average of 5 per cent. That yield is
higher than the current inflation rate of 4 per cent - a relationship which
has been rare during the past 20 years. The ratio of gilt to equity yields
(around 2) also makes shares look good value in historical terms.
Judging by yesterday's activity, private investors were enthusiastically
buying shares on the back of the election result. But those who feel they
have missed out by not joining the post-election rush may still find, if
they are prepared to put money away for five years or more, that it is a
good time to buy equities.
Doing so via a Pep may be attractive, but make sure that the charges do not
outweigh the tax benefits. If equities yield 5 per cent, then a basic rate
taxpayer who buys into a PEP with a 5 per cent front end charge will have to
wait four years to recover the charges in tax savings. Unit and investment
trust Peps, of course, now qualify for the full Pounds 6,000 allowance (see
Page V).
The more cautious may be attracted to gilt yields of 9.6 per cent to 9.7 per
cent. For basic rate taxpayers, that represents a net real yield of around
3.2 per cent. If interest rates fall under a Conservative government, then
this may be an attractive time to lock in these rates. However, there is a
risk that gilt prices may fall if the government's borrowing requirement -
which is already high  - rises further.
It is also worth remembering what happened in Norman Lamont's Budget, which
now seems a long time ago.
Some changes did not get through Parliament before the election, and can now
be resurrected. Farmers and owners of small businesses can now look forward
to exemption from inheritance tax, and the general IHT threshold can now
rise to Pounds 150,000. Future, more sweeping, changes to inheritance tax
may follow in later Budgets, now that John Major has a mandate.
The new 20 per cent income tax rate on the first Pounds 2,000 of taxable
income will now apply, and there are increases in many of the personal
allowances (although not the married couple's allowance).
Tax efficiency will still be important after the election, even though wives
will not be entitled to claim all or half the married couple's allowance
until 1993-94. But couples where one partner is taxed at 40 per cent, and
the other at zero, 20 or 25 per cent, can still profit from a suitable
redistribution of savings.
However, it seems likely that the scope for radical shake-ups in the tax
regime will be limited, at least in the early years of the new government.
The chancellor is unlikely to want to encourage new forms of saving in the
short term - he wants consumers to spend their way out of the recession.
Tax cuts may arrive but readers should not get too excited at the prospect.
Some expect a Pounds 40bn borrowing requirement in the 1993-94 budget
deficit, which makes the chancellor's leeway very limited. And no doubt the
government will want to handle the electoral cycle a little more expertly
this time - and, unlike Nigel Lawson, keep any cuts up its sleeve until
nearer the next election.
In short, higher earning readers may be relieved at John Major's re-election
 -but they should not assume that everything will be coming up roses for the
next five years.

FT  11 APR 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: How it looks after four more years -
London Markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARTIN, Financial Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The FT's newly installed Group VII fax machine has mysteriously offered up
the following analyst's note dated July 9 1996 from Back, Track &amp; Hindsight,
the London stockbroker.
THE main investment themes of John Major's second term of office are now
obvious. At the begining, however, it was easy to lose sight of them amid
the market's April 1992 post-election euphoria.
Our specialist team of Retrospective Portfolio mangers, using 20/20
Hindsight, our proprietary suite of analytical software, have identified
four themes of the second Major term:
Convergence, divergence, explosion. At the UK level, all the attention in
1992 was focused on the way in which the ERM made sterling a high-yielding
D-Mark. This was a replica of the prevailing wisdom at the European level:
economic convergence on the way to monetary union.
Convergence ruled for the first year or so, dragging foreign money into the
UK markets to take advantage of cheap valuations compared with much of the
rest of the world. But the political tensions that resurfaced across the EC
once the first flush of recovery gave way to sluggish growth led to the
second phase: divergence. As governments increasingly tried to edge their
economic policy away from the restrictive clutches of the Bundesbank, the
pressures inside the ERM became too great.
Result: explosion. What started as an attempt to ease the strains with One
Last Realignment rapidly degenerated into a 'temporary' period of floating
rates, during which sterling fell sharply. This finally gave John Major a
bout of rapid economic growth. But by igniting two years of 7 per cent-plus
inflation, it made people who'd plumped for bonds rather than equities wish
they hadn't thought a new era was dawning.
Manufacture or die] Sterling depreciation was a bonus for a manufacturing
sector that had already settled into a period of sustained outperformance.
As one engineering company boss put it, even before John Major was
reinstalled in Downing street: 'I can hire a graduate engineer for half the
cost of my German competitors, and in a business where what matters now is
engineering value-added, that's a significant long-term cost advantage.' The
international focus of those manufacturing firms that survived the 1980s
helped them get through the slow growth of the early 1990s in better shape
than the more domestically-oriented service industries. Except for one:
Wasting away. It was inevitable that the waste issue would hit the UK in the
mid-1990s as it had hit the US, Scandinavia and Germany over the preceding
decade. Helped by the Recycling Charter introduced by the new minister for
rubbish, Lord Patten of Bath, the industry took off in the UK. Among the
keenest participants were the water companies, whose momentary relief at
escaping from Labour's vague threats to de-privatise them them soon gave way
to gloom about the increasingly fierce regulatory regime. Waste provided an
unregulated escape route. Still, the roller-coaster growth the industry
offered - and the swings in ratings suffered by all glamour sectors with
scandal potential - made the waste arms of the water companies uneasy
bedfellows with their regulated activities. A wave of flotations seemed
inevitable.
Shares of ageing minds. Two long-running trends - the ageing of the baby
boom and the oversupply of consumer brands caused by globalisation and by
manufacturers' attempts to offset slow underlying growth with lots of
new-product launches - combined to create the mind-share showdown. As the
baby-boom turned 40, its members' willingness to learn about new brands
declined sharply, greatly raising the premium on existing brands. This
particularly applied to brands which had enjoyed their peak of
fashionability during the baby-boomers' adolescence. Few UK companies
controlled world-wide brand-names any more, but those that did moved briskly
to a premium rating, creating a Nifty 15 of high-priced consumer stocks.
These four themes are not the only key investment principles identified by
Retrospective Portfolio Management. Advanced techniques in this field -
marketed under the Firm's slogan 'You'll Always Look Good With Hindsight' -
also allow us to identify with accuracy trends that didn't happen. One of
these is the big Property/Banking Play of 1994. The theory was that the best
way to play a coming recovery in London property prices was to buy the
shares of the banks, since by now they had foreclosed on most of the
property.
Just as the pessimists' predictions of the 1980s top in the property market
had proved several years too early, however, the optimists' predictions of
the bottom also overstated the speed of developments. Though some
fundamental trends seemed to be moving in property's favour  - not least the
inflation generated by sterling depreciation - the underlying lack of demand
still told against it.
The key to the success of Retrospective Portfolio Management is to avoid
over-eager asset allocation decisions. We are recommending that clients who
wish full exposure to the retrospective trends of the second Major
government should be fully invested in our key themes by Q2 1997. Investment
research for the next prime ministership is well under way, and clients can
expect full briefings with support material in early 2002.

Small company shares had a rocky week in the lead up to the election result.
The Hoare Govett Small Companies Index (capital gains version) fell 1 per
cent from 1131.74 to 1119.96 in the week to April 9; the County Small
Companies index fell 1.1 per cent from 899.27 to 889.31 over the same

FT  11 APR 92 / Finance &amp; The Family (At A Glance): Pearl cuts savings
bonuses
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Pearl Assurance has reduced its bonuses on with-profits savings contracts.
The adjustments to the contracts are complex, and vary between the ordinary
and industrial branches. The overall effect follows the trend for the
industry, with pay-outs for 10-year policies hit hard, while 25-year policy
maturity values have risen slightly.
Using the standard assumption that policies were started by a 29-year-old
man paying premiums of Pounds 30 per month, the ten-year has dropped by 6
per cent from Pounds 8,046 (which made it one of the market leaders) to
Pounds 7,561. Pay-outs over 25 years increased by 0.3 per cent from Pounds
55,462 to Pounds 55,631.

FT  11 APR 92 / Finance &amp; The Family (At A Glance): Income bonds chaos
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Labour's surprise defeat sent the market for guaranteed income bonds into
chaos yesterday. Actuaries were expecting a Labour government, with
attendant higher base rates, and were offering more generous rates
accordingly.
The Tory victory led them to cut rates, or withdraw bonds altogether, in a
hurry. Chase De Vere reports that yesterday Alico, Financial Assurance and
Hambro Guardian withdrew all their bonds. Prosperity and General Portfolio
lowered all their rates, while Liberty Life withdrew its 4-year bond, and
Aetna announced it would withdraw its 5-year bond by Monday morning.
Those who bought GIBs earlier this week will be happy about the situation.
However, the rates on offer on Friday were so unclear that the Weekend FT
was unable to include the bonds in the Best Rates table for this week.

FT  11 APR 92 / Finance &amp; The Family (At A Glance): The view from abroad
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Now the UK is a member of the European exchange rate mechanism, will its
stock markets follow the continental lead?. The graphs show just how much
the markets of the other members have tended to track each other once their
exchange rate parities are established.
Neither the Milan nor the Frankfurt market has managed yet to regain the
heights reached before the Gulf War. Both have been almost locked together.
But they showed very different responses to elections which took place in
both countries on Sunday.
Stocks on the Milan market dropped following the Italian general election
results, which saw the fall of the Christian Democrat-led coalition
government. As the UK markets had demonstrated over the last few weeks,
there is nothing dealers like less than uncertainty, and there is plenty of
it about in Italy.
Meanwhile, Frankfurt traders were unmoved by the swing to the hard right in
two state elections, potentially destabilising, and the DAX moved up on the
strength of stronger bond futures and promising economic news.

FT  11 APR 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: The Fed rides to the rescue - Wall
Street
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JUST AS Wall Street was circling the wagons this week, the Federal Reserve
rode to the rescue with a timely interest rate cut.
The Fed's decision on Thursday to lower the federal funds rate (the interest
rate at which banks borrow from each other) from 4 per cent to 3.75 per cent
may have been motivated purely by a desire to breathe fresh life into the
halting economic recovery, it mattered little to the stock market, which in
the two days prior to the rate cut had wiped more than 90 points off the Dow
amid panic about a financial meltdown in Japan and its effect on the world
economy.
Thursday's easing, however, saw the Dow regain halve that lost ground, and
by midday yesterday another 30-odd points had been put back on the index.
Although the Fed may be privately pleased with the impact of its rate cut on
share prices, it insists restoring confidence in financial markets was not
the idea behind the policy ease.
No, domestic economic priorities steered its hand, says the Fed. If you
subscribe to this view, money-supply and inflation appear to have been the
key factors at play.
Until the middle of the first quarter, the money supply was growing steadily
as lower interest rates persuaded banks to increase lending. From
mid-February onwards, however, the money supply started to shrink again,
with the various measures of money (M1, M2 and M3) all posting declines for
four to five straight weeks.
The most recent numbers must have been particularly disturbing to the Fed,
which reported late on Thursday that its most widely favoured measure of
money shrank more than Dollars 7bn in the last week of March, following a
Dollars 10bn drop the previous week. This put the money aggregate's annual
growth rate at just 2.4 per cent, taking it outside the Fed's target range
of 2.5 per cent to 6.5 per cent.
Alan Greenspan, the Fed's chairman, has always placed great emphasis on
controlling the money supply, and he will have been especially worried to
see it shrinking just at the time when the recovery appeared to be picking
up pace.
Fortunately, the lack of inflationary pressures in the economy left plenty
of room for an easing of policy. Thursday's morning's March producer prices
data, showing a modest 0.2 per cent increase in wholesale prices meant the
Fed could cut rates one more time without the fear of fanning the
inflationary flames.
(Admittedly, the market, and the Fed's, complacency about inflation took a
knock yesterday when the March consumer prices figures showed an
unexpectedly sharp rise of 0.5 per cent. Analysts, however, were quick to
dismiss the number as an aberration created by seasonal factors, arguing
that the weakness in the economy all but guarantees that inflation will
remain dormant over the medium-term.)
Whatever the reasoning behind it, the stock market took to Thursday's rate
cut like a drowning man to a rope. Wall Street, however, in typical fashion
has probably overdone its reaction, both to the likely impact on US markets
of the problems in Tokyo, and to the likely economic effectiveness of a cut
in fed funds.
Talk of a meltdown in Japan plunging Wall Street into crisis and the US
economy back into recession is off the mark. The withdrawal of Japanese
assets from overseas markets started more than two years ago, and Japan's
international lending has already been cut nearly in half since its peak in
1989.
The bulk of Japan's foreign assets are concentrated in bonds and direct
investments, not US stocks, while the Japanese finished selling the bulk of
their holdings of US Treasury bond more than a year ago. Turmoil in Tokyo
should also have little impact on the US economy. Its recovery is, and will
be, driven by domestic demand.
As for the effect of the rate cut, a quarter of a percentage point off fed
funds is unlikely to set the economy ablaze. Bank prime rates will stay
where they are at 6 1/2 per cent, and the all-important medium-term bond
yields - which determine mortgage interest rates  - have shown no
inclination of budging from around 7 per cent.

FT  11 APR 92 / If you're out there - Help]: Earth is beset by problems. But
assistance may be at hand. Nasa is soon to start an ambitious search for
extraterrestrial intelligence
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
'At this instant, through this very document, are perhaps passing radio
waves bearing the conversations of distant creatures - conversations we
could record if we but pointed a telescope in the right direction and tuned
to the proper frequency . . .'
 - Astronomy Survey Committee of the US National Academy of Sciences, 1972.
SUPPOSE YOU are staying in Beverly Hills, Los Angeles, and you want to get
to Nasa's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena. It is simple. You drive
south, then east, then south and then east again on to the Santa Monica
freeway.
As it is the rush hour, the traffic buzzes angrily. You peek at other
drivers. Boy, have they got problems; they're probably in therapy. But you,
you're doing fine, because you have now sort of drifted across five lanes of
traffic and have somehow turned north on to the Pasadena freeway.
As you wheel along, you fiddle with the radio 'Seek' button, flicking from
station to station, hundreds of them, seemingly, pumping out pop, rock, rap;
bulletins and news flashes; rapes and serial killings; messages from our
sponsor; dog food and vitamin pills; Tums, Skippy, Tylenol - uproar,
babeldom.
As it happens, radio and TV signals broadcast on Earth are also transmitted
into space at the speed of light. The earliest TV transmissions from Earth
have travelled more than 40 light years, or ten times further than Alpha
Centauri, our own sun's nearest neighbour. This radio, radar and TV leakage
of ours now fills a sphere more than 80 light years in diameter. (A light
year is the distance light travels in one year: about 6 trillion miles).
In addition, we have sent into space a few intentional messages, such as
that broadcast in 1974 at the rededication of the Arecibo Observatory in
Puerto Rico. The message included descriptions of our solar system, the
elements important to Earthly life and the structure of the DNA molecule. We
beamed that message in the direction of the globular star cluster M13, about
25,000 light years away.
Which is all fine and good. But what about incoming messages? Are we ready
to receive, as well as transmit? After all, our own Milky Way galaxy
contains an estimated 300bn-400bn stars. And with each passing year,
estimates of the probability of intelligent life on far-flung planets
increase. In the view of many scientists on Earth, we are within reach of
one of the key steps in our evolution - knowledge of the existence, nature
and activities of independent civilisations in space.
Are we ready for incoming calls? The answer is Yes: we are about to start
serious eavesdropping. On October 12, Columbus Day, Nasa will launch its
ten-year, Dollars 100m (Pounds 57.8m) Search for Extraterrestrial
Intelligence, or Seti programme - a systematic search of the microwave radio
spectrum for signals of intelligent origin. Seti is a joint venture between
Nasa's Ames Research Centre and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory of the
California Institute of Technology.
As such, it is part of one of the seven areas of Nasa research recommended
by the National Commission on Space in 1986: 'A continuing programme to
search for evidence that life exists - or has existed  - beyond Earth, by
studying other bodies of the solar system, by searching for planets circling
other stars, and by searching for signals broadcast by intelligent life
elsewhere in the galaxy.'
Naturally, the launch of Nasa's Seti programme will prove a lodestar for
jesters, cynics and two-bit comedians, the banality of whose jokes - 'I was
on my way to Venus when all of a sudden . . .' - will be as predictable as
the Flat Earth witticisms that reverberated in Columbus's ears when he set
sail for America 500 years ago.
BIOASTRONOMY - the study of life in the universe, and the search for
evidence of intelligence - is now so respectable that it is almost
strait-laced. A few generations ago, astronomers believed that planetary
systems were extremely rare; that the Earth's ability to support life was
possibly unique.
In the last two decades, however, advances in astronomy and physics have
supported the idea that planets are not rare but a natural part of the
star-formation process, and may number in the hundreds of billions in our
galaxy alone. As a result, in 1990 the US Congress voted funds for Nasa to
design and build special digital processing systems capable of searching
tens of millions of radio channels.
Is anyone out there? In the editors' foreword to the account of proceedings
at the Third International Symposium on Bioastronomy in Savoie, France, in
June 1990, the complex trail of cosmic evolution is described in five
stages:
First, the appearance of matter soon after Big Bang, leading to the
formation of stars and planets several billion years later and continuing
with the synthesis of chemical elements like carbon;
Second, formation of the first organic molecules; these molecules have been
discovered in interstellar space by radio-astronomers and in comets by space
probes;
Third, a prebiotic chemistry stage in which complex building blocks are
produced, such as nitric bases that form the rungs of the DNA double helix
ladder; some theories predict that a prebiotic chemistry could be proceeding
even now on Titan, the large moon of the planet Saturn;
Fourth, a primitive biological stage like the one of bacteria which
dominated the Earth's first few billion years; scientists hope to discover
this form of biological activity, perhaps in a different form, buried in the
permafrost of Mars;
Fifth, 'advanced' life, perhaps more advanced than ours. Nothing - so far -
indicates that Homo sapiens are unique in the universe.
To quote Nasa: 'One direct way of testing whether intelligent life exists
beyond our solar system is to search for an artificially generated radio
signal coming from interstellar space. Advanced civilisations might be
operating radio beacons, possibly to attract the attention of emerging
societies and bring them into contact with a community of long-established
intelligent societies existing throughout the galaxy.'
To detect either type of signal - beacon or leakage  - it makes great sense
to look at frequencies where background radio noise is minimal. 'One of the
quietest regions of the electromagnetic spectrum', says Nasa, 'is the
'microwave window' that lies in the frequency band between 1,000 and 10,000
megahertz (MHz). It is reasonable to assume that others wishing to establish
interstellar contact by radio might choose this band.'
SO OFF WE GO, though not for the first time. The first serious proposal for
using radio waves to transmit information over interstellar distances was
suggested by physicists Philip Morrison and Giuseppe Cocconi in Nature in
1959. Since then, more than 50 searches have been conducted by dozens of
astronomers in at least eight countries. These were primitive efforts, using
equipment designed for other purposes and limited in duration, sensitivity,
number of channels, types of signals and numbers of stars observed. In spite
of these limitations, most of those searches found unexplained signals.
What is new about the Seti programme starting on October 12, says Nasa, is
the technology now available. Existing radio telescopes on Earth are
sensitive enough to detect, at distances of 1,000 light years or more,
signals no more powerful than some now leaving Earth. In addition, advances
in data processing make it possible to sift automatically through millions
of frequency channels each second and, if present, identify signals
transmitted by intelligent societies.
The Seti plan involves two complementary modes. First, there will be an
all-sky search covering nearly 500m channels in the 1,000-10,000 MHz range,
plus spot bands up to 25,000 MHz, using the 34-metre antennas of Nasa's Deep
Space Network. This sky search will cover at least 10,000 times more
frequency space than all previous survey attempts and will be about 300
times more sensitive.
Second, a special targeted search using the largest available radio
telescopes (including Arecibo) will examine nearly 800 sun-like stars within
100 light years of Earth. Some stellar clusters and nearby galaxies will
also be observed. This targeted search will examine 2bn channels over a
frequency range of 1,000-3,000 MHz, plus higher spot bands.
Would we recognise an intelligent signal? Quite easily, apparently.
Would Nasa tell us if it did detect a signal? You will not catch Nasa out
like that. 'Once a signal is confirmed as being of ETI origin, an
announcement of the discovery would be made as quickly and as widely as
possible', it claims. 'One way in which the announcement could be made is
described in a Declaration of Principles Concerning Activities Following the
Detection of Extraterrestrial Intelligence.'
Would we know what the signal meant? Apparently we would. If intentional,
the signal will be anticryptographic - easy to decode. A civilisation bent
on sending messages would probably employ simple tutorial pictures and use
an interstellar Esperanto based on universal physical and mathematical
principles. Conversely, a civilisation's own domestic output - Neighbours of
M13, News At Sixty  - may be difficult to decipher.
Would senders know their messages had been received? No, not unless we
replied. Nasa itself has no plan for replying. As part of the International
Seti Post-Detection Protocol now under consideration, it would be up to the
nations of Earth whether, and how, to reply.
How much will the Seti project cost? The cost for a ten-year period is
described as averaging Dollars 10m a year, or less than 0.1 per cent of
Nasa's budget - 'less', it claims winsomely, 'than a nickel per American per
year.'
Against a background of ballooning US federal budget deficits and the
spectre of US poverty, Nasa has become as skilled as any institution in
fighting its corner and defending its plans.
Even if no signal from space is detected, it says the technology developed
to search for faint signals from distant planets can be applied to more
down-to-Earth problems in medical diagnostic imaging, resource exploration,
aircraft safety and electronics. It will also yield uniquely detailed
astronomical data and have useful spin-offs in education. But if a signal
was detected, why then: 'Information gathered from other civilisations may
provide important practical as well as social and philosophical benefits.'
HOWEVER MANY times Nasa says that Seti has nothing to do with UFO detection
or little green men, it knows it cannot stanch the jokes among the
unsophisticated. In Washington, one politician railed against Seti's 1990-91
budget like this: 'Of course there are flying saucers and advanced
civilisations in outer space. But we don't need to spend Dollars 6m to find
evidence of these rascally creatures. We only need 75 cents to buy a tabloid
at the local supermarket.'
When I finally reached the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, north of Pasadena, I
was asked at the reception desk for photographic ID, plus my 'resident
alien's card.' I explained that I was not a resident alien, merely an alien.
A little later, I described this exchange to Dr Michael J Klein, Seti's
project manager at the JPL, who laughed quite cheerfully, just as Columbus
must have laughed till his face ached while supervising the provisioning of
his ships. Klein's equivalent of provisioning is moving equipment into
California's Mojave desert and supervising numerous other tasks while trying
to ward off budget cuts.
'We are not talking about little green men or space travel', he told me.
'This is not scientific fantasy. Seti is a search. We are not transmitting.
Somebody else will do that. For us, going to the stars is not a 20th century
possibility. It may not be a 28th century possibility, but at least we now
have the means to listen for sounds of other technologies. It's a bit like
cutting an acre of grass. To date, we've used nail-clippers; now we've got a
lawnmower.
'Attitudes among scientists differ. People disagree on the chances of
success, but everybody agrees that it should be done: there is good science
coming out of it.'
For the record, Klein is a church-goer. 'Do I believe in a supreme God? Yes,
I do. I don't have a lot of answers, but I have a lot of awe and faith. I
believe in a Creator who established the laws of physics.'
And - for the record  - yes, Klein does expect that one day Earth will
detect an intelligent signal from somewhere in the Milky Way. 'My guess is
that such a signal will be detected at a distance much greater than ten
light years. I would guess 100 or more. Most of us who work on Seti believe
that some day there will be contact via communication - not space travel.
There won't be dialogue because of the time lags involved, though there may
one day be dialogue between generations. We hope we are the ones who
succeed. At least we are starting things off. It will not prove futile.'

FT  11 APR 92 / The Long View: It's recession as usual
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARRY RILEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE WILL be no rise in interest rates to defend sterling, no attack on the
water companies and other privatised utilities and no 59 per cent personal
taxes to disturb City of London lifestyles. What a relief. But if the stock
market had not taken the public opinion polls so seriously there would not
have been anything to worry about in the first place.
Now back to business. Out there beyond politics the recession goes on,
although perhaps the housing market will show flickers of life as
uncertainty is removed. The same could be true in a modest way of the
corporate expansion.
Internationally, things have been happening that may even turn out to be
more important than the British election result. There is, for example, the
other election campaign in the United States where recession could prove to
be a more potent threat to George Bush than it was to John Major. At any
rate, the US authorities moved to push dollar short-term interest rates down
another quarter-point this week, which is a sign that they are determined to
stoke up the economy almost regardless of the inflationary risks.
The Americans may, of course, have one eye on the dramatic events in Tokyo.
There was an overdue stock market rally there yesterday, but even so the
Nikkei Average is down 2 1/2 per cent on the week and 22 per cent on the
year so far. The dangerous game long played by the leading Japanese banks in
relying for much of their capital base on holdings of vastly overvalued
equities is at last leading them into deep trouble. Maybe the Japanese
authorities will be able to prevent this from leading to a calamitous crisis
of confidence, but at the very least the Japanese banks are going to have to
shrink a long way, and that may mean withdrawal from most of their overseas
business.
Two or three years ago Japanese stocks represented 45 per cent of the global
stock market, but the proportion has now collapsed to less than 25 per cent.
It has been a salutary experience for global investors who have tried to
copy the world index rather than look at the value for money being offered
in different markets. On standard yardsticks Tokyo is still significantly
overvalued. But what may be very bad news for investors in Japanese equities
could turn out to be good news for shareholders in companies elsewhere, at
least after an awkward transition period.
The Japanese asset price bubble of the 1980s spilled overseas in the second
half of the decade. The cost of capital to Japanese companies shrank almost
to zero, culminating in the torrent of equity issues and bond-plus-warrant
issues at the very end of the bull market. The warrants are now all
worthless, and the share prices have halved or worse, but the cheap capital
financed a huge investment boom in Japan and a massive expansion drive by
Japanese industrial companies and banks in much of the rest of the world.
Inevitably the result of the over-investment has been a collapse in the
return on capital in Japan, where profits are under serious pressure in many
sectors. Internationally, too, profitability has been destroyed in those
industries which the Japanese penetrated. This week Fortune magazine
published its annual list of the 500 biggest American corporations in terms
of sales. Three of the top four suffered substantial losses in 1991, these
being General Motors, Ford and IBM, all in industries exposed to the
Japanese steamroller. The fourth, Exxon, remained profitable, and indeed
industries such as oil, food, pharmaceuticals and chemicals, which have not
been attacked by Japanese companies to the same degree, have generally
remained healthy.
Banking is, of course, another of the global industries which has been
undermined by Japanese competition. This is not to say that Western bankers
were not themselves guilty of imprudence in the 1980s lending spree, but at
least the playing-field will be more level in the future. The risk now,
however, is that the Japanese will withdraw too fast, leaving a credit
crunch as their legacy.
Industrial bosses in Europe and the US will now view the pricking of the
Japanese financial bubble with some satisfaction. At last Japanese companies
face the task of paying the going international rate to their providers of
capital. There is nervous talk that Japanese companies will even have to
start paying realistic dividends on their stock: the average dividend yield
is still only about 1 per cent. And some Dollars 150bn of bonds with equity
warrants attached will have to be refinanced at market rates.
John Major may have other things on his mind in the next few days, but at
some stage he - or his Trade Secretary  - ought to consider the implications
of the Japanese financial crisis for his government's industrial policy. It
may be dangerous to continue to rely on Japanese companies to revive British
manufacturing industry in sectors such as cars and electronics. We cannot be
sure that their British operations will continue to be competitive once the
supplies of cheap capital run out.
That the economic background continues to look troubled, however, will not
be a disappointment for a Tory government returned with a majority which
should last for a five-year term. John Major will not wish to repeat the
mistakes of Margaret Thatcher and Nigel Lawson in stimulating a boom too
early in the Parliament. This recovery must be slow and more securely
founded.
An early step should be a clampdown on pay growth. If the central exchange
rate in the ERM is to be taken at all seriously British pay inflation must
come crashing down from its current carefree 7 per cent-plus. As for the
economy at large, there must be less talk about a consumer spending upturn
and much more about a recovery in manufacturing output, without which
economic growth will lead to a balance of payments crisis.

FT  11 APR 92 / De Klerk visit to Nigeria wins rapturous reception
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATTI WALDMEIR
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ABUJA, NIGERIA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR F W de Klerk, the South African president, yesterday declared a historic
breakthrough in relations with Pretoria's former enemy, Nigeria, as he ended
a two-day state visit marked by surprising cordiality and high emotion.
General Ibrahim Babangida, the Nigerian president, showered Mr de Klerk with
extravagant praise during his visit, the first by a white South African
leader to Nigeria. At a state banquet on Thursday night, he declared that Mr
de Klerk deserved a place among the most famous black South African
anti-apartheid fighters: Mr Nelson Mandela, president of the African
National Congress (ANC), Mr Steve Biko, the black consciousness leader who
died in police custody under a previous white government, and Archbishop
Desmond Tutu, the anti-apartheid cleric.
These were extraordinary words from a Nigerian given the open hostility
which has characterised Nigeria's relations with South Africa for decades.
But Gen Babangida went beyond mere rhetoric to physical embrace: he grasped
Mr de Klerk's hand and the two men stood swaying to the strains of Nigerian
music, a remarkable demonstration of their new-found reconciliation.
Nigerian officials say President Babangida wants to establish diplomatic
relations with Pretoria and to sponsor South Africa's entry into the
Organisation of African Unity, of which he is currently chairman. This would
be possible only after a multi-racial interim government is established in
South Africa, likely within months.
Reconciliation with South Africa is likely to prove the largest foreign
affairs achievement of President Babangida's career. He is due to hand over
to a civilian government at the year end.
Both President Babangida and Mr de Klerk repeatedly stressed their joint
vision of a brave new future for Africa built around a Lagos-Pretoria axis
which they hope will give the continent new clout in international
relations.
There were frequent protestations of African brotherhood from both sides,
with each eyeing the economic benefits of closer co-operation. President
Babangida said: 'We are delighted that we have at last found someone in
South Africa with whom we can do business.' Indeed, the real prize of the
trip will be normalised commercial relations between Africa's two regional
superpowers.
The leaders of South Africa's three largest business organisations
accompanied Mr de Klerk to Nigeria, where they met Nigerian business leaders
to discuss renewing trade ties.
They said clandestine trade with Nigeria had carried on throughout the
sanctions period but could be much increased, perhaps to more than R200m
(Pounds 40.2m) a year.
Nigerian crude oil is not suitable for South African refineries, but
Nigerian manufacturers are keen to import South African steel and industrial
chemicals.

FT  11 APR 92 / The Lex Column: Privatisation
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The huge leap by some of the privatised utilities yesterday - the
electricity package rose by 24 per cent - was less surprising than it
looked. Having fallen out of bed in the run-up to polling day, they were
simply moving back to their pre-election levels. It was slightly puzzling,
however, that water shares should have closed at their highest levels ever.
In theory, the market should simply have reverted to pricing the various
sectors according to the sure prospect of gradually tightening regulation.
In practice, that applied with unique rigour to British Gas, which barely
rose at all.
The extent of yesterday's gains in the water sector can be justified if
investors think the companies will have a materially better run against
their regulator under a Tory government than any other. The evidence for
that is scarcely conclusive.
It is also worth pointing out that the privatisation band-wagon is unlikely
ever to roll with its old momentum. In part, that is because candidates such
as the coal industry will be disposed of by trade sales. But the government
will doubtless also work on the assumption that small investors are now wise
to the risks of tight pricing and will be less inclined to fall for
marketing hype.
After all, the more recent privatisation shares were far from being
giveaways. Even after yesterday, shareholders in the Scottish electricity
companies are nursing paper losses, while shares in the two generators have
performed poorly relative to the market. Investors will also be slow to
forget the havoc wrought in water and electricity in the past few weeks.

FT  11 APR 92 / The Lex Column: Interest rates
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The trouble with the sterling money market is that it sometimes tries to be
just a little too perfect. It tried in vain to discount a base rate rise
while Labour was ahead in the polls. Yesterday it was reluctant to discount
a cut till much later in the summer.
This time, however, it may well be right. The argument that a Tory victory
would so underpin sterling that the government could quickly kick-start the
economy by cutting rates is doubly flawed. Despite yesterday's euphoria,
sterling's close of DM2.88 was nearly half a pfennig below its narrow band
range in the ERM. And with the election over, there is less political
urgency about economic recovery.
It would be reasonable to suppose that the election result will by itself
generate some recovery in consumer spending. The risk is that, like the
response to last year's Gulf victory, the momentum might fizzle out after a
month or two as more intractable problems such as the property market
resurface.
The best policy prescription might be to wait till that point is reached
before using any limited scope for a rate cut.
Granted, yesterday's inflation figures again confirmed that the UK's current
performance is better than that of Germany. However, base rates are only
0.75 percentage points above the Lombard rate. The UK cannot easily sustain
more than a half point cut until the Bundesbank moves lower too.
The chances of that are slim while German money supply growth is three
percentage points outside its target and the wage round has not been
satisfactorily concluded. And unless sterling were at or around its DM2.95
central rate, trying to buck the German trend would look as though the
Government's ERM commitment was taking second place.

FT  11 APR 92 / The Lex Column: Painting the town blue
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
For the City's market operators, yesterday was Christmas and birthday rolled
into one. The Tories were back in charge, business was booming, sterling was
strong, Tokyo finally staged a recovery and US interest rates were down.
Perhaps equally important, they were no longer faced with the loss of maybe
a fifth of their take-home pay; indeed, many had received their bonuses
early to keep the cash out of Mr John Smith's clutches. But for all the
exuberance, it was noteworthy that equities, sterling and the money market
only returned to where they were when the election was called a month ago.
Is there a case for the markets going higher again?
The principal argument, of course, is that a month ago the spectre of a hung
parliament - with the likelihood of another election again  - was in itself
a burden on the economy. Not only has that burden been lifted, there is also
some evidence that the economy is finally struggling to life on its own.
Tesco and Next made confident noises about an end to recession this week,
while heavy truck sales have shown their first rise since 1989.
Never mind that there is no real indication yet of how robust the recovery
will be. The timing seems established, and that is worth something on the
price in itself.
It is quite possible that these arguments will prove persuasive, and that
the more optimistic broking houses are right in expecting the FT-SE to be
somewhere near 3,000 by the year end. But there are counter-arguments. A
month ago the Tokyo market was 17 per cent higher than it is now, despite
yesterday's sharp recovery. The UK commercial property market has taken a
series of further downward lurches, threatening a degree of damage to the
domestic banking system. And despite the modest rise in sterling yesterday,
market talk of an imminent cut in base rates owes more to general euphoria
than to logic.
And, of course, there is a formidable increase in the scale of government
borrowing. Strictly speaking, that has been in the market since budget day a
month ago. But the position has been greatly obscured since then by
competing claims from the parties over the cost of manifestos and the threat
of higher Labour borrowing again. Now that the threat has been lifted, it
need not follow that the market will warm to over Pounds 30bn of new gilts
from a Tory administration, however greedily it snapped up the surprise
issue in the small hours of Friday morning.
Traditionally, the equity market has tended to rise sharply to greet a Tory
victory and to drop back thereafter. That need not be the pattern in this
case, since the victory came as a genuine surprise and may not yet be fully
in the price. All the same, the market has risen almost 180 points in the
space of two days. It is asking a lot for it to maintain the pace.

FT  11 APR 92 / World Stock Markets: Firmer crude prices boost European oils
 -Until recently, investors worldwide were bailing out of the sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Fears of UN sanctions against Libya and renewed friction between Iran and
Iraq have lifted crude prices above Dollars 19 a barrel this week, giving a
much needed boost to European oil shares.
Until only recently, depressed oil prices and a February meeting of the
Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec) that failed to agree
substantial production cuts to support the market, prompted investors to
bail out of oil shares worldwide.
The malaise has been particularly marked in the UK, but shareholder
disaffection with underperforming oil companies has spread to Europe where
most oil stocks suffered a drop in share prices.
Goldman Sachs has reviewed 28 worldwide oil companies to find that only
three have outperformed their respective local stock markets so far this
year. Repsol, the Spanish oil company, has outperformed the Madrid market by
10 per cent in the first three months of the year, Norsk Hydro made a
relative outperformance of 14 per cent in Oslo, and Burmah Castrol, the
UK-based lubricants and chemicals group, has beaten the FTSE All-Share index
by 15 per cent.
Mr Christopher Buckley, oil analyst at Goldman, believes that Repsol
continues to offer strong upside potential. 'The company has a dominant
position in the Spanish market which is a growth market for petrol. The
company also has an attractive stake in the country's natural gas market.'
While the Spanish petroleum market is being opened to more competition, Mr
Buckley does not believe this will adversely affect Repsol's margins since
it owns such a major part of the country's infrastructure.
In addition, Elf Aquitaine, the French oil and chemicals group, and British
Petroleum, the UK-based oil major, have invested a lot of money to gain a
footing in the Spanish market and are unlikely to initiate a price war.
The two French oil companies, Elf and Total, are at the top of many analysts
'buy' lists since both have been breaking free from domestic bureaucracy and
aggressively expanding overseas in the past two years. Both have ambitions
to rank among the top five international majors by the end of the decade.
Elf recently became the first western oil company to conclude purely
production-sharing contracts with Russia and Kazakhstan where it will be
able to drill for oil without a local partner. . The venture could add as
much as 20 per cent to its oil reserves by 1995.
An indication of Elf's popularity came in mid-March when the French
government sold a 2.3 per cent stake in the company to domestic and overseas
investors. The offering was three times over-subscribed in spite of the
company's share price weakening slightly in advance of the sale.
Total's shares have picked up in recent weeks after showing a flat
performance against the Paris market earlier this year. A stock split in
February and hopes of improved earnings for last year have contributed to
Total's stronger share price. This week the company lived up to market
expectations by announcing a 22 per cent increase in its 1991 dividend to
FFr7, justified by the 43 per cent rise in attributable profit to FFr5.81bn
(Dollars 1.1bn).
Total, which has more exposure to refining than Elf, is also looking to
increase its reserves rapidly over the next couple of years. It has a 20 per
cent involvement in the major Cusiana field in Colombia which has been
estimated to contain over 1bn barrels of oil.
As Elf and Total enter the big league as major international players, other
companies such as Austria's OMV and Belgium's Petrofina are focusing their
strategies closer to home.
OMV has international ambitions and two years ago bought a portfolio of
assets in the North Sea, but its international exploration business remains
a lot smaller than its local refining and marketing operations. The company
is using its strong central European base to move into the newly-opening
Eastern European petrol market in Hungary and Czechoslovakia.
These ventures are unlikely to yield much return in the short term and the
company's chemicals business remains depressed by the downturn in the
industry. But both could provide good long-term growth.
Petrofina has focused on its local markets and achieved a high degree of
integration between its oil refining and chemicals business. It has also
built up a very strong marketing network. 'But it has the feel of being a
very soundly run company without much short-term sparkle,' says Mr Buckley.
Indeed, many of Europe's oil companies could lack a short-term spark until
there is evidence of a sustained recovery in the oil price and improvement
in refining margins. For that, investors will have to look more to the next
Opec meeting on April 24 than to the companies themselves.

FT  11 APR 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei gains 7.6% on
rises overseas

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Tokyo
SHARP rises in leading overseas markets prompted short-covering and
bargain-hunting in Japanese blue chips, and the Nikkei average surged
1,252.51 or 7.6 per cent to close at the day's high of 17,850.66, writes
Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The jump in the Nikkei was also fuelled by heavy futures-linked buying. The
index opened at the day's low of 16,622.24, but despite the day's gains, it
was still down 3.8 per cent on the week.
Volume rose to 380m shares from 350m shares. Advances outnumbered declines
by 966 to 67 with 56 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first section
stocks advanced 86.37 or 7.2 per cent to 1,282.56. In London, the ISE/Nikkei
50 index rose 7.05 to 1,047.32.
Market participants were encouraged by the cut in the US Federal Fund rate
and the ensuing rally in the US stock and bond markets. Japanese bonds and
the yen also firmed in response.
Comments by Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the prime minister, that the government was
considering allowing public pension funds to invest in the stock market
improved sentiment. Some domestic institutions were seen buying blue chip
issues towards the close.
Mr David Stuart at James Capel said the market was looking oversold, and
only needed a simple trigger to rise. However, he added that if short-term
interest rates do not decline next week, the Nikkei index could test new
lows.
Mr Yasuo Ueki, head of Nikko Securities' equity division, said short-term
traders, who had sold heavily on Thursday, were covering short positions.
However, he added that with the Nikkei rebounding over 1,000 points in one
day, share prices had bottomed out for the time being.
Foreign buying of bank shares after their recent slide helped the Nikkei to
recover. Several banks rose by their daily limits. Industrial Bank of Japan
rose Y200 to Y1,560 and Mitsubishi Bank advanced Y200 to Y1,500.
Industrial blue chips were stronger. Nippon Steel rose Y15 to Y295 and
Mitsubishi Heavy Industries firmed Y58 to Y569.
Electricals were stronger, led by Teac which advanced Y100 to Y975. NEC rose
Y59 to Y1,000 and Hitachi turned up Y38 to Y810.
Nippon Telegraph and Telephone rose Y18,000 to Y608,000. Other leading
gainers included low liquidity Nikkei component shares. Daito Woollen
Spinning and Weaving rose Y36 to Y810 and Godo Shusei added Y33 to Y923.
In Osaka, the OSE average gained 904.22 to 19,249.77 in volume of 14.7m
shares.
Roundup
THE RISE in Tokyo and New York lifted the Pacific Rim.
HONG KONG closed up 4 per cent, helped by news that the Conservative party
had been returned to government in the UK. The Hang Seng index gained 191.72
to 4,921.11, slightly ahead on the week. Turnover was HKDollars 2.83bn
against HKDollars 2.48bn.
SINGAPORE rose strongly. The Straits Times Industrial index advanced 28.09
to 1,380.92, but was down 1.3 per cent on the week. Turnover fell to
SDollars 90m from SDollars 109.3m.
SEOUL fell to a new low for the year. The composite index shed 6.33 to
569.65, a 4.5 per cent fall on the week. Turnover fell to Won248.2bn from
Won256.6bn.
TAIWAN shed early gains but the weighted index still finished up 35.80 at
4,563.85, although down 3.6 per cent on the week. Turnover was TDollars
16.3bn against TDollars 14.87bn.
MANILA was little changed. The composite index shed 1.63 to 1,134.83 in
light trade, a 1.5 per cent rise on the week. Turnover rose to 224.6m pesos
from 221.7m pesos.
KUALA LUMPUR reversed four days of declines. The composite index put on 7.62
to 571.31, for a 2.6 per cent rise on the week. Turnover was MDollars 120m
after MDollars 132m.
AUSTRALIA's All Ordinaries index advanced 36.7 to 1,582.0, a 1 per cent rise
on the week.

FT  11 APR 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): UK election result fuels
continental rally
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CONSERVATIVE victory in the UK general election added fuel to the
continental rise yesterday, writes Our Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT was boosted by a stronger Japanese market, the easing of monetary
policy by the US Federal Reserve and the return of a Conservative government
in the UK. Analysts said the end to the political uncertainty in Britain
raised hopes for a cut in UK interest rates in the second half of the year.
There were also expectations that a UK economic recovery would boost German
exports.
The DAX index closed ahead 15.82 to 1,736.07, a gain of 0.95 per cent on the
week, while the FAZ index, calculated at midsession was up 8.02 at 706.67,
for a rise on the week of 0.63 per cent. Turnover rose to DM6.2bn from
DM5.1bn.
The construction group Hochtief advanced DM13 or 1 per cent after saying
that it would increase its dividend to DM12 from DM10. Degussa closed
unchanged at DM336 after saying that it was not anticipating another cut in
its dividend and reported a slight increase in six-month group profit.
Banks were stronger following comments late on Thursday by a central banker
that there was room for a cut in interest rates during the second half of
the year. Deutsche Bank was ahead DM4.3 at DM715.5 and Commerzbank gained
DM4.2 to DM268.0
Preussag gained DM4.10 to DM401 on news that group net profit for the first
four months was unchanged.
Daimler-Benz was DM10 up at DM778. After the bourse closed it said that it
was investing DM36bn in research and development over the next five years.
PARIS built on Thursday's gains as the CAC-40 index ended up 30.42 or 1.6
per cent to 1,974.06, also up 1.6 per cent on the week. Turnover was
estimated at FFr3bn.
Oils remained firm. Total rose FFr4.60 to FFr249.60 after announcing
pleasing 1991 results after the close on Thursday. The oil refiner's
analysts meeting was heavily attended yesterday. Elf rose FFr7 to FFr375.40.
Euro Disney, which opens this weekend, recovered FFr3.20 to FFr140.90 after
its recent weakness.
Among smaller stocks, L'Oreal jumped FFr30 or 3.7 per cent to FFr849 ahead
of its results on Monday.
MILAN failed to match the rises on other European bourses as interest
remained thin. The Comit index rose 4.93 to 501.16, but was 1.5 per cent
lower on the week, as turnover rose slightly to around L90bn from L77bn.
Dealers reported an unusual amount of block trades, some linked to the
liquidation of a local broker. A block of 1.1m shares or 2 per cent in the
state aerospace and engineering group, Alenia SpA, went through the market
at L3,169.40 per share, well above the share's closing price of L1,938, down
L15.
Fiat rose L25 to L4,745 and the tyre and cable maker Pirelli rose L28 to
L1,229. The food sector rose 3.6 per cent, with Eridania up L299 to L6,800
and Sme rising L100 to L3,400.
ZURICH consolidated Thursday's gains, assisted by a fall in domestic
interest rates. The SMI index closed up 18.9 at 1,848.0 for a 1 per cent
advance on the week.
Banks led the gains: Union Bank bearers were SFr50 stronger at SFr3,790 and
Swiss Bank bearers added SFr5 to SFr283.
AMSTERDAM followed other European bourses higher. The CBS Tendency Index
closed up 1.3 at 124.7, unchanged on the week. Turnover was Fl 757.9m after
Fl 578.9m.
A lack of corporate news kept individual stocks relatively quiet during the
session, although Elsevier continued to be actively traded, closing Fl 2.7
higher at Fl 113.5, while Unilever gained Fl 1.6 to Fl 182.2.
Pakhoed was stronger following analysts' presentations in London and
Amsterdam in which the transport group said that the outlook for 1992 was
not as bad as forecasts earlier in the week had predicted. It gained 60
cents to Fl 41.10.
MADRID took its cue from the UK. The general index gained 3.53 to 249.84, a
rise of 0.3 per cent on the week. However, analysts said that there was
caution ahead of Monday's inflation figures. Volume in Union Fenosa was
exceptionally high at 3.5m shares and it closed down Pta5 at Pta468.
STOCKHOLM rebounded from a three-day slump in heavy trading. Easing money
market rates as well as news late on Thursday that the drawn out battle for
control of the insurer Skandia had come to an end lifted sentiment. The
Affarsvarlden general index rose 14.6 to 975.6, down 0.5 per cent on the
week, in turnover of SKr568m after SKr431m.
BRUSSELS rebounded in line with other markets. The Bel-20 index rose 13.16
or 1.1 per cent to 1,178.77. Solvay, which announced on Thursday it would
hold its dividend steady at BFr500 a share despite a 22 per cent decline in
1991 profit, rose BFr175 to BFr12,200.

FT  11 APR 92 / London Stock Exchange: Market celebrates with 132-point rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
RED EYED and leaden footed from lack of sleep and nervous exhaustion,
London's equity market dealers trickled home highly satisfied after trading
throughout the night and day.
They witnessed and participated in the equity market's biggest single day
rise since the rally that followed the infamous Black Monday crash in
October 1987. The FT-SE 100 share index closed 136.2 higher at 2,572.6,
taking the index back to its pre-budget level.
The general election triumph of the Conservative Party, whilst not entirely
unexpected by many of London's investment community, nevertheless took a
number by surprise and was followed by a flood of buying of UK shares and
Government stocks.
The FT-SE 100 share index, electrified by intense domestic and overseas
buying interest during a frantic night's trading, climbed above 2,600 during
pre-market trading and before officially opening 132.2 higher at 2,568.6.
Although largely irrelevant to the day's trading, dealers also took note of
Wall Street's strong showing which in turn stimulated a big rally by the
Tokyo market.
At its best official level yesterday, shortly after Wall Street opened with
further good gains, the Footsie was over 150 points higher, having slipped
back to being 'only' 113 points up some two hours after trading commenced.
The morning brought a steady stream of institutional buying until around
10am when, in the words of one dealer, 'the UK institutions really got
going.' Turnover in equities reached a massive 1,345.4m shares, by far the
heaviest this year.
Market strategists were almost universally bullish of the post-election
market. Mr Mark Brown at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, said 'we have dusted off our
old Conservative target of 3,000 on the FT-SE at year-end; overseas money
looks to be coming back, boosting sterling, which in turn will help interest
rates to fall. Mr Bob Semple at County said 'the market looks set to fly;
'helped by a recovery in the economy and with interest rates set to fall it
has all the ingredients for our second-half target of 3,000. Mr Richard
Kersley at BZW is sticking with a year-end target of 2,750 and cautions on
the probability of rights issues. Strauss Turnbull's Mr Ian Harnett sees a
10 per cent rise in the market to the year end, while Mr Mark Howdle at JP
Morgan said the Conservative victory will trigger a major equity rerating;
2,650-2,700 looks realistic.
Retail business in equities picked up strongly as investors, scenting a Tory
election win piled into equities, particularly the utilities.

FT  11 APR 92 / London Stock Exchange: Properties hit by talk of big sale
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN, JOEL KIBAZO, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and COLIN MILLHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PROPERTY stocks were depressed again yesterday, despite the huge surge in
the rest of the equity market, as further news emerged underlining the
fundamental problems besetting the sector.
A report in the trade press suggested that Norwich Union was about to sell
Pounds 300m of City office buildings in an attempt to reduce its exposure to
the ailing commercial property market. Traders said the story pointed to the
continuing weakness in office rentals, which are falling by 30 per cent a
year, according to a report from surveyors Richard Ellis published
yesterday.
Mr Carl Gough at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew said the re-election of a Conservative
government had not changed the house view on the sector. 'We were negative
before and we are negative now. Even with the prospect of lower interest
rates, the amount of property overhanging the investment and letting market
will make sure the sector continues to underperform relative to the rest of
the market.' UBS forecasts that this will be by 9.5 per cent over the next
two years.
Of the leading stocks, MEPC lost 2 to 286p and Hammerson ordinary plunged 24
to 360p. Making small gains were: Great Portland Estates, up 4 to 139p, Land
Securities ahead 10 at 386p, and British Land 5 better at 172p.
Utilities shine
Utilities had obvious attraction after the election, because the stocks were
so politically vulnerable. Mr Donald Waterman, analyst at Panmure Gordon,
said many investors were underweight in the sector during the run up to
Thursday's poll. He added that fears of renationalisation under Labour had
probably been overdone, but it was 'the uncertainty of what Labour might do,
rather than the reality of what they would do' that had hit shares during
the election campaign.
Electricity and water shares showed gains of up to, and in some cases above,
20 per cent. The Scottish generators failed to fully sustain early gains
which took them above their partly paid offered price of 100p, but finished
up around 13 per cent, with Scottish Power rising 12 1/2 to 95 1/2 p and
Scot Hydro 13 to 98p.
Hanson active
Conglomerate Hanson was the most heavily traded stock on the London market.
It closed 10 up at 227p with a massive recorded turnover of more than 55m
shares. Dealers said Hanson, with significant international exposure, was
well placed to benefit from hopes of a US recovery and any improvement in UK
economic fortunes. Also, securities house UBS Phillips &amp; Drew became a buyer
of the stock because of the 'elimination of political worries'.
Attitudes towards the stock were further enhanced by the sharp rise in ICI,
as Lord Hanson is believed to still have a 2.8 per cent stake in the
chemicals and pharmaceuticals group. ICI, which has been well regarded in
the light of recent rationalisation and which tends to be an indicator of
market trends, jumped 35 to 1308p and that rise would have added around
Pounds 7m to the value of the Hanson stake.
Oils languish
The oil majors failed to participate in the market euphoria as concern about
their financial prospects continued to cast a pall. BP has been hit by a
number of profit forecast cuts in recent days as well as concerns about the
potential of Columbia's Cusiana oil field, in which it has a large stake. It
has one friend in securities house Hoare Govett, the company's broker, which
this week turned buyer of the stock but most houses are sellers and there is
a feeling that recent buying in the US is also drying up. The shares rose
only 2 to 250p.
Shell announced that its Australian subsidiary faced legal action from coal
miner Austen and Butta to stall a bid. It lifted just 4 to 465p.
Most of the oil companies were relatively weak. Lasmo was down at one stage
before rallying to close a penny up at 192p. Enterprise gained 3 to 396p.
US investors were said to be enthusiastic buyers of Glaxo following recent
underperformance. The shares lifted 19 to 782p.
The best-traded utility stock was the British Telecom partly-paid, with
nearly 53m shares being recorded. The shares, which made a high of 126p,
closed at 119 1/2 p, up 19 on the day. The rise meant the shares passed
their offer price of 110p.
BT ordinary gained 21 to 335p, after hitting 341p at one stage. Turnover was
28m.
The removal of the threat of extra regulation in the telecoms sector also
helped Vodafone Group, the shares climbing 35 to 349p in big volume of 13m.
Laura Ashley was a weak feature among a buoyant stores sector, falling 3 to
88p. Dixons put on 26 to 236p, following Thursday's recommendation from
County NatWest, while Kingfisher, another on the County buy list, rose 43 to
530p.
Pearson, which has a 16 per cent stake in BSkyB, had been held back by vague
concerns that it might be affected by a proposed Labour party review on
media ownership. With those fears out of the way and with renewed hopes for
an upturn in advertising revenues the shares bounced 63 to 843p. Granada
Group, another BSkyB shareholder, jumped 22 to 257p.
Publisher United Newspaper's rise of 29 to 388p was assisted by positive
research from SG Warburg Securities.
Building stocks soared on the hope of an interest rate cut.
Construction groups also prospered, particularly south-east England house
builders, such as Berkeley Group up 56 at 276p.
The fact that Labour's minimum wage would not now be enacted sent Forte 39
higher to 243p in very big turnover of 9.4m. Courtaulds Textiles, also
previously overshadowed by the Labour policy, leapt 53 to 490p. Rank
Organisation jumped 47 to 735p. US interest rate cuts helped Thorn EMI to
add 37 to 804p.
The ending of election uncertainty was likely to unleash a rush of holiday
bookings, said some analysts. Airtours jumped 33 to 274p and Owners Abroad
added 7 1/2 to 97 1/2 p.
Smith Industries added 25 to 305p ahead of next week's interim figures.
British Aerospace moved 20 ahead to 338p as it announced it was looking for
a buyer for a majority stake in its corporate jet division.
VSEL, where fears recently surfaced that a fourth Trident submarine would
not be ordered in the event of a Labour party win, greeted the Conservative
party victory by initially recording a 60p jump. The shares eventually ended
at a more modest 40 up at 370p.
Siebe reversed its recent dull performance since it entered the FT-SE 100 by
jumping 33 to 632p.
The poor outlook for steel in both the UK and Europe caused the shares of
British Steel to register a modest gain of only a penny to 70p. Some 12m
shares were traded.
Eurotunnel was one of two FT-SE 100 stocks to buck the market trend easing a
penny to 402p as worries about the company's finances remained.

<TEXT>
TURNOVER in stock index futures reached record levels as the derivatives
markets raced forward on news of the Conservative Party victory, writes Joel
Kibazo.
The June contract on the FT-SE opened sharply up but quickly fell back,
despite maintaining a high premium to cash as institutions moved in to
unwind pre-election positions. Dealers reported good business at the 2610
level both from unwound positions and a flurry of overseas buyers that had
waited for the outcome of the election.
A firm Wall Street only served to encourage further buying and, by the
close, turnover had reached a record 21,165 contracts, surpassing the
previous high of 17,052 recorded in October 1989.
June closed at 2,602, up 126 points on the previous close and about 9 points
above its estimated premium to cash of about 22.
Volume in traded options was also very high at 95,767 contracts with a
sizeable amount of arbitrage business recorded. Turnover in the FT-SE option
rose to 51,137 lots, smashing the previous record of 43,973, January 1990.
Thames Water was the busiest stock option. It traded 6,827 contracts in
brisk two-way business.

FT  11 APR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Base metals finish on bullish
note - Week In The Markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD MOONEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHILE THE Tory election victory gave a psychological boost London Metal
Exchange traders yesterday, news of a 0.25 per cent cut in the US Federal
Reserve's discount was seen as a more convincing explanation for widespread
gains in base metals prices.
The biggest mover was zinc, which closed at Dollars 1,304 a tonne in the
cash position, up Dollars 40 on the day and Dollars 31 on the week. The rise
was also influenced by covering against options granting and concern about
the apparent tightness of supplies available for nearby delivery, the latter
factor being reflected in a widening in the cash premium over three months
metal to Dollars 16.50 a tonne from Dollars 8.50 at Thursday's close.
Zinc's growing 'backwardation', as the cash premium is known in the trade,
had prompted the LME board to warn traders on Thursday that it was closely
monitoring the situation and had at its disposal 'courses of action which
would be introduced should circumstances dictate the necessity of such
actions'.
Mr Martin Abbott, the exchange's director of marketing, described that
statement as 'a warning shot across the bows of anyone who might be thinking
of playing any games in the zinc market'. In normal circumstances cash
prices are quoted at discounts to the forward prices, the development of a
backwardation being associated with supply shortage. So its appearance when
zinc stocks in LME registered warehouses stand at a recored level is bound
to cause suspicion, especially among industrial users, who feel they are
being forced to pay inflated prices to close out hedging positions.
Last week, when a moderate backwardation appeared in the tin market Mr David
King, the LME chief executive, let it be known that that market was one of
those being watched 'more closely than others'. And by the end of the week
the cash premium had disappeared. But it returned this Thursday and at
yesterday's close stood at Dollars 32.50 a tonne. Dealers explained that
demand for quality brands had prompted increased 'borrowing' (buying cash
and selling forward) on the exchange, which has mostly ordinary high grade
metal in its warehouses. The cash tin price closed yesterday at Dollars
5,915 a tonne, up Dollars 155 on the week.
The other significant advance yesterday was in the aluminium market, where
the cash position put on Dollars 14.75 to close at a nine-month high of
Dollars 1,338.50 a tonne, up Dollars 39 on the week. The advance was
reported to reflect option-related and speculative buying encouraged by the
announcement on Tuesday of a smaller-than-expected rise in LME stocks and
yesterday of an unexpected fall. In addition the International Primary
Aluminium Institute reported yesterday that western world smelter stocks,
excluding finished products, fell by 62,000 tonnes in February to 3.323m
tonnes.
The only LME metals to show losses yesterday were copper and lead, which,
being denominated in sterling, were casualties of the UK currency's
post-election rise. Copper was also hit by an unexpected rise in LME stocks
as the cash price fell Pounds 18.25 on the day to Pounds 1,252.50 a tonne,
down Pounds 37 on the week.
At the London bullion market platinum prices were hit by forecasts of
further substantial Russian shipments and by bouts of Japanese selling,
believed to result from investors' need to cover equity market losses. But a
rally in Tokyo share prices yesterday cheered platinum traders and the
London price regained Dollars 4.30 at Dollars 349.50 a troy ounce, showing a
net fall on the week of Dollars 6.25 an ounce.
The attention of coffee traders was mostly engaged this week by the London
council meeting of the International Coffee Organisation, where delegates
were attempting to agree arrangements for negotiations on a new
price-supporting International Coffee Agreement.
Price movements on the coffee futures market tended to reflect the somewhat
spasmodic progress made at those talks. Traders were encouraged by Tuesday's
approval of a working group recommendation to proceed to negotiations on a
pact based on universal quotas. But then the meeting appeared to become
bogged down over how many delegations should participate in the negotiations
and how soon they should begin. As last night's scheduled end of the council
meeting approached the market was depressed by the delegates' apparent lack
of urgency and London's May robusta futures position ended the day Dollars
10 lower at Dollars 864 a tonne, down Dollars 5 on the week.

FT  11 APR 92 / Money Markets: Rate cut hopes grow
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
SHORT sterling sprang ahead but rates eased only slightly as news of the
shock Conservative win in Britain's general election was absorbed by the UK
money markets.
Talk of an immediate cut in interest rates was considered premature, but
speculation that the authorities would reduce base rates in the next three
months continued.
The three-month interbank rate - they key indicator of future base rate
levels - eased only slightly on the day.
Mr Simon Briscoe, senior UK economist at Greenwell Montagu, said the
three-month rate suggested there was a fairly good chance of an interest
rate cut between now and July, but the market was not really 'gunning for a
cut'.
The authorities would probably wait for a stronger pound before deciding to
cut rates, he said.
In spite of the enthusiasm generated in the markets by the Conservative win,
poorer than expected inflation figures suggested there were still good
reasons for the government to wait before cutting interest rates. Figures
from the Central Statistical Office showed a year-on-year increase of 4 per
cent in February, compared with the market's forecast of 3.8 per cent.
'Having said so much about inflation, the Conservatives will have to make
sure they keep the lid on it,' said Mr Briscoe.
Three-month rates stood at 10 7/16 - 5/16 down from 10 7/8 -10 5/8 . One
year rates eased to 10 5/16 - 3/16 from 10 15/16 -10 13/16 .
The June contract opened 87 basis points higher at 90.01 but drifted back
during the day. With trading volumes touching highs not seen since Britain
entered the ERM, the contract stood at 89.92 in late trading.
The Bank of England forecast a liquidity shortage of Pounds 950m this
morning which it revised to Pounds 900 later in the morning. In early
operations it bought Pounds 18m of band-1 bank bills at 10 3/8 per cent. In
further morning operations it bought Pounds 308m of band-1 bank bills at the
same rate. It continued to operate in the afternoon buying Pounds 54m bills
including Pounds 1m of band-1 Treasury bills and Pounds 53m band-1 bank
bills both at 10 3/8 per cent. It provided late assistance of around Pounds
130m bringing total operations of the day to Pounds 510m. This left the
market apparently under-relieved by around Pounds 400m. But closing rates,
though high at around 11 1/2 per cent, did not suggest that the situation
was really that tight.

FT  11 APR 92 / International Company News: Adia slides to SFr42m despite
cost reductions
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ADIA, the Swiss-based inter-national employment services group, yesterday
announced sharply lower profits for 1991 as the recession in North America
and Europe squeezed margins and hampered the group's ambitious programme to
sell off non-core businesses.
Net consolidated earnings, calculated on a 1990 basis before divestments,
fell to SFr42.5m (Dollars 29.9m) from SFr115.4m in 1990, on slightly lower
group revenues, down to SFr4.04bn from SFr4.11bn the previous year.
Net earnings of the parent company, Adia Holding, amounted to SFr5m for the
six months to end-December, against zero in the year to end-June. The
company will again recommend to shareholders that no dividend be paid.
Operating profits of Adia's employment services business, where it ranks
number two in the world behind Manpower of the US, fell to SFr43m in 1991
from SFr149m in 1990. Despite the recession, turnover fell only modestly,
from SFr3.3bn in 1990 to SFr3.2bn in 1991.
Adia said intense competition to preserve market share had depressed
margins, despite measures to cut costs and reduce staff.
Mr Nico Issenmann, Adia's chief executive, said turnover in the first
quarter of 1992 was 5 per cent higher than a year earlier, but added that he
expected another difficult year. Although the economic situation could well
improve in the US, he foresaw 'no marked pick-up' in Europe.
The company nevertheless expects at least to match last year's results in
1992.
Adia shifted direction last year to concentrate on its core personnel
business after Swiss businessman Klaus Jacobs and Asko Deutsche Kaufhaus,
the German retailing group, took control of the group from Mr Werner Rey's
Omni Holding, which is in liquidation. The sell-off programme concerns
mainly security, inspection and computer leasing companies in Europe and the
US.
The divestment programme reduced the company's net debt by SFr300m to about
SFr1.3bn.

FT  11 APR 92 / International Company News: Benetton rival carves out its
own identity - Stefanel hopes to step out of the better-known group's shadow
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Only 30 kilometres and the fast-flowing Piave river separate Stefanel, the
Italian clothing group familiar for its brightly coloured knitwear, from
Benetton, its bigger and better-known rival.
The two have more than just local roots in common. Together, they have
spearheaded the international rise of Italian casual clothing, which has
found buyers from Brighton to Bogota, thanks to attractive designs and
affordable prices.
The similarities between Stefanel and Benetton stretch to the way they run
their businesses. Both depend on substantial sub-contracting, which has
restrained overheads and allowed a strong element of family control, even
after going public. The two have also emphasised heady sales growth in their
rush to conquer both developed markets and lay down their markers elsewhere.
As the smaller of the two, Stefanel tends to stress its differences with
Benetton, rather than their similarities. Although its product range largely
overlaps that of Benetton, it is still best known for its patterned
knitwear, which tends to be slightly more expensive than its rival's
apparel. Around 70 per cent of Stefanel's buyers are women, a higher
proportion than for Benetton, and it appeals to a slightly older public.
Stefanel also makes clothing under other names - another difference. The
business has developed through takeovers of smaller Italian specialists.
Last year, it even struck a deal with Romeo Gigli, an avant-garde designer,
to produce an up-market ready-to-wear line called G Gigli.
Problems at Stefanel's subsidiaries partly explain why sales and earnings
for 1991, due to be released on April 28, will be virtually static at a time
when Benetton has reported substantial increases. Turnover will be static at
about L435bn (Dollars 355.6m), while net profits will broadly match the
L36.1bn made in 1990.
Mr Giuseppe Stefanel, the group's 40-year old chairman, ascribes the outcome
partly to difficulties at its CFM subsidiary, which cost around L32bn in
lost turnover last year.
Mr Stefanel, who took over the company after his father died in 1987, also
admits that earnings have been squeezed by tougher economic conditions in
many markets, Italy included. Recession has made consumers much more price
conscious.
'If you say we've reached the day of truth, I agree. You can't sell an item
for L100,000 if it's only worth L50,000,' Mr Stefanel says.
Consumers are weighing up prices much more carefully against quality and
fashion content than in the past, he believes. However, he remains
confident: 'Our company has always done best in moments of crisis.'
In spite of claiming that headlong sales growth is not its main aim - unlike
Benetton - Mr Stefanel is also keen to raise turnover. The group expects
sales to climb by around 15 per cent to about L500bn this year, in spite of
shoppers' greater caution. The eventual target is growth of 15 to 20 per
cent a year - admittedly not easy when retail prices 'are virtually
constant,' he admits.
The increase will come through further gradual expansion of the group's
franchised store network, which currently numbers around 1,450 outlets. Much
of the emphasis is being placed outside Italy, which already accounts for
about two thirds of Stefanel's shops and about 70 per cent of sales.
The medium-term term objective is to increase sales to L1,000bn to L1,200bn.
That means roughly doubling the current number of outlets to 3,000. With the
domestic market already well covered, the bulk of the growth will have to
come abroad. He expects domestic sales to fall to about 40 to 50 per cent of
total turnover in the medium term.
In its effort to stand out from Benetton and carve out its own markets,
Stefanel has embarked on ventures in a number of out-of-the-way locations
such as China and eastern Europe. Stefanel boutiques are already operating
in Yugoslavia, Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Romania, and its first store
opened recently in Beijing.
The new shops have potential, but their contribution to sales has been
limited so far. Mr Stefanel admits the company has a medium-term outlook
towards its ventures. 'We started with enthusiasm. Now we have to take
account of reality,' he says with just a tinge of disappointment.
While new stores in markets of the future may fuel longer-term growth, the
world's established economies are the key to Stefanel's immediate success.
Completing its European coverage takes pride of place.
Stefanel is already well-placed in Germany, where it sells through the
Karstadt department store chain, alongside some independent high street
stores of its own. France and Spain are its two other European targets. The
aim is to increase the number of European stores, including Italy, by half
from around 1,000 at present.
Much the same is planned for Japan, where there are now about 60 Stefanel
outlets. As in Germany, many are 'corners' in big department stores rather
than the independent units. Growth is also planned elsewhere in Asia, where
there are already 150 Stefanel outlets in all. The company's first
Indonesian store is due to open soon.
Surprisingly, the US, where there are just 10 Stefanel shops so far, is low
on the priority list, in spite of a recent move into an eye-catching
location on New York's Fifth Avenue. 'The US doesn't really interest us for
now,' says Mr Stefanel. 'Our first aim is to complete our plans elsewhere,
and then to confront the US. It's the sort of market which you should either
take on properly, or not at all.'

FT  11 APR 92 / International Company News: Hafnia shareholders to resist
Skandia takeover
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SHAREHOLDERS in Hafnia, the Danish insurance group, will attempt to block
the takeover offer by Skandia, the Swedish insurer. The offer was announced
on Thursday.
The deal would create a group with premium income of SKr22bn (Dollars 3.6bn)
and assets of SKr176m.
Mr Flemming Skov Jensen, director of the Wage Earners' Supplementary Pension
Fund, which holds 2 per cent of the Hafnia capital, said yesterday that the
offer of nine Skandia shares for four of the Danish insurance group was too
low.
He plans to call an extraordinary general meeting to muster the necessary
support from shareholders to block the Skandia bid.
Meanwhile, Uni Storebrand, which is Norway's largest insurance group, said
that it would more than double its premium income as a result of the deal
between Skandia and Hafnia.
Uni Storebrand agreed to take over Skandia's reinsurance operations outside
North America in exchange for most of Uni's shareholding in Skandia,
according to a preliminary agreement announced on Thursday.
Skandia's share price climbed SKr6 to SKr136 in above-average volume when
trading in its shares resumed yesterday.
The share price had closed at SKr130 on Wednesday before activity in
Skandia's shares was suspended on Thursday ahead of the announcement.
Traders in Stockholm said investors looked favourably on Skandia's deal.
Skandia would become the largest insurer in Denmark, as well as succeeding
in divesting itself of most of its reinsurance operations, which have made
heavy losses recently.
Hafnia and Uni Storebrand saw their share prices fall yesterday when trading
opened. Traders said the fall in Hafnia's A shares - from DKr358 (Dollars
56.55) a week ago to DKr325 yesterday - had stemmed mainly from Hafnia's
announcement that it had suffered heavy losses last year.
Uni's shares dropped back NKr5 to NKr54 (Dollars 8.42) when trading started
yesterday afternoon.

FT  11 APR 92 / International Company News: Westinghouse suffers 6% decline
in net income

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
WESTINGHOUSE Electric, the US conglomerate which has been hit hard by poor
real estate investments, yesterday reported a 6 per cent drop in
first-quarter net income, excluding accounting changes.
However, at the operating level the company managed a 24 per cent
improvement, which Mr Paul Lego, the chairman, said partly reflected a
cost-reduction plan launched late last year.
He added: 'While some of our businesses are recording slight improvements in
order rates, most of our businesses are late (economic) cycle and have yet
to experience increased order activity.'
Net income totalled Dollars 92m, or 27 cent a share, on revenues of Dollars
2.83bn, compared with Dollars 98m, or 34 cents, in the same period of last
year on revenues of Dollars 2.78bn.
However, after adopting new standards of accounting for retirees' health
benefits and taxation, the company reported a loss of Dollars 246m, or 72
cents a share.
The operating profit was Dollars 194m, up from Dollars 157m, and the
operating profit margin rose from 5.7 per cent to 6.9 per cent.
However, the company's 'other income' line decreased sharply, from Dollars
41m last year to just Dollars 7m.
The company's troubled financial services unit, the centre of its real
estate problems, recorded net income of Dollars 4.2m, compared with Dollars
21.2m last year. The sharp decline reflected an increase in non-earning
assets and the sale of certain assets.
The subsidiary, which is trying to reduce sharply its property portfolio,
said it had disposed of assets for about Dollars 400m of cash during the
quarter, and deals in the pipeline would increase the total to Dollars 500m.
Westinghouse's broadcasting business produced a higher operating profit, due
mainly to cost improvements, on flat revenues.
The electronics segment saw a substantial rise in profits, thanks to cost
controls and increased revenues.
Revenues at environmental services dipped slightly but profits rose because
of cost reductions and additional incinerator income.
The industries segment produced a significant rise in operating profit but
Knoll, the office furniture group, saw a dip, due primarily to deteriorating
construction markets in Europe.

<TEXT>
SABENA, the Belgian state airline, yesterday signed a partnership deal with
Air France, and forecast its profit would increase by 1995 to BFr4.48bn
(Dollars 133.3m) before preference dividends. Its debt would come down to 87
per cent of own funds, the carrier said.
Mr Pierre Godfroid, the Sabena chairman, said the airline was 'like a
phoenix rising from its ashes'. In 1991 the group made an operating profit
of BFr2.13bn after a 1990 loss of BFr7.15bn.
The Sabena-Air France link, which will also lead to close commercial and
management co-operation, was cleared by the Belgian government last week,
after months of frustrating delay while a new coalition government was being
formed in Belgium.
The link will involve Air France and its Belgian financial partners
injecting BFr6bn into Sabena and taking a 37.5 per cent stake. The Belgian
government, which has already provided substantial funds, will add a further
BFr9bn.
Mr Bernard Attali, the Air France chairman, and Mr Guy Coeme, Belgian
transport minister, both welcomed the deal.
The business plan for Sabena envisages turnover increasing from BFr54bn this
year to BFr67bn by 1995, and a profit of BFr414m in 1992, with sharp
increases in the next three years.
Mr Coeme yesterday tried to defuse the inevitable political controversy in
Belgian about the French participation. Some Flemish politicians believe it
will upset Sabena's linguistic balance.

appointment

   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
VOLKSWAGEN'S supervisory board yesterday set the seal on the management
succession at the German motor group by confirming the appointment of Mr
Ferdinand Piech to succeed Mr Carl Hahn as chief executive next January.
A committee of the non-executive board had already recommended that Mr
Piech, 54, who runs VW's up-market Audi subsidiary, should take over at the
VW group, with Mr Daniel Goeudevert, 50, the French-born head of the VW
marque, as his deputy.
The appointment was preceded by speculation as to whether the abrasive Mr
Piech, the more conciliatory Mr Goeudevert or an outsider would succeed Mr
Hahn, 65, whose contract had originally been extended to the end of 1993.
It comes at a time of growing internal concern over VW's cost problems
compared with those of other producers in Europe and Japan. The choice of Mr
Piech, an innovative engineer, shows VW's determination to bring costs down.
Even against domestic rivals such as Opel (part of General Motors) and
Ford-Werke (owned by Ford of the US), its costs are high. According to Mr
Stephen Reitman, an analyst with stockbroker UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, 'VW's
internal studies suggest the group has an average 40 per cent assembly cost
disadvantage compared with the Japanese.'
Mr Piech, the grandson of Mr Ferdinand Porsche who designed the VW Beetle
and the first Porsche sports car, said recently 'a murderous struggle' would
rage in the world motor industry.

Restructuring enabled Business Technology Group to move back into profit in
the second six months.
However, the return to profitability still left profits for the full 1991
year Pounds 599,000 down at Pounds 119,000 pre-tax.
The second half profit of Pounds 273,000 compared with first half losses of
Pounds 154,000.
The new management team continued to pursue its policy of reducing
borrowings and concentrating on the core business of the sale and servicing
of office equipment.
During the year net debt was reduced by Pounds 4.9m and since year-end
Copyplan Midlands and the majority of the group's finance lease receivables
have been sold resulting in a further reduction of Pounds 2.7m in net debt.
After tax of Pounds 66,000 (Pounds 248,000) and extraordinary gains of
Pounds 284,000 (charges Pounds 88,000) profits for the year emerged at
Pounds 337,000 (Pounds 382,000).

Strong growth in the principal markets of Foreign &amp; Colonial Pacific
Investment Trust reflected in the net asset value. Over the year to January
31 1992 it rose 25 per cent to 211.9p.
Investments are spread over 12 countries of the Pacific region. Only in Hong
Kong did the trust fail to outperform the local indices.
Most significant feature of portfolio activity was the investment in US,
Japanese and Australian bonds, which comprised 17 per cent of the portfolio
at the year-end.
Geographically, the largest holdings in the fund are Japan 42.4 per cent,
North America 21.8 per cent, and Australia/New Zealand 15 per cent.
Total revenue in the year was Pounds 6.44m (Pounds 6.39m).
The attributable balance fell to Pounds 2.08m (Pounds 2.73m) as there was a
substantial increase in interest payments on the borrowings to fund the move
into bonds.
Earnings per share came to 1.95p (2.57p). The final dividend is 1p for a
total of 1.75p (1.55p); holders have also received a special 0.35p.

FT  11 APR 92 / UK Company News: Willam Jacks cuts loss to Pounds 850,000
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
William Jacks, the motor dealer with Mercedes, Jaguar, Rover, BMW, Saab, and
VAG franchises, improved over the second half.
It finished with a loss of Pounds 850,000 for the year ended January 31
1992, after Pounds 601,000 at midway. For the previous year the deficit was
Pounds 872,000.
The group was helped by proceeds from last September's convertible
preference rights issue which, together with a significant reduction in
working capital, substantially strengthened finances.
Turnover fell to Pounds 41.9m (Pounds 42.6m). New car turnover was within
1.5 per cent of the previous year, although that was achieved on
significantly lower margins.
Operating profit was maintained at Pounds 286,000 (Pounds 272,000) through a
substantial cut in expenses and an encouraging growth in after-sales
activities.
New car sales in January and February were 'generally encouraging'. Certain
manufacturers appeared to be establishing better controls over the creation
of large unsold stocks, with a beneficial effect on margins.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Manganese Bronze, best known for production of the traditional London taxi,
incurred a pre-tax loss of Pounds 492,000 in the six months ended January 31
1992, after a heavier deficit at the Darlington foundry. The comparable
period produced a profit of Pounds 287,000.
Darlington had been in loss for some time, but in the latestperiod it
amounted to Pounds 514,000. The foundry will be closed as soon as
practicable with the net effect of an additional Pounds 1.7m charge;
however, the cash effect was not expected to exceed an outflow of Pounds
500,000.
Group turnover fell to Pounds 33.9m (Pounds 38m) for a trading loss of
Pounds 429,000 (profit Pounds 690,000). There were exceptional redundancy
costs and severance payments of Pounds 63,000 (Pounds 403,000). Losses per
share were 2.3p (earnings 0.6p).

FT  11 APR 92 / UK Company News: Second half boost for Ulster TV
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
ULSTER Television showed a recovery through 1991 boosted by a significant 11
per cent increase in advertising revenue over the final quarter.
And for the opening three months of the current year there had been a 13 per
cent rise in revenue from that source.
'We remain cautiously optimistic about a gradual improvement in the economy
and are therefore forecasting some modest real growth in our advertising
income in 1992', said Mr John McGuckian, chairman.
In 1991 the group lifted pre-tax profit from Pounds 1.92m to Pounds 1.95m,
after making only Pounds 134,000 (Pounds 1.32m) in the first half as
advertising revenue fell 7 per cent from the effects of the Gulf war and
recession.
Turnover was up to Pounds 25.1m (Pounds 24.7m) with advertising income
accounting for Pounds 23.75m (Pounds 23.72m).
Earnings per share came to 16.18p (11.54p) before exceptionals and 11.26p
(10.82p) after. The proposed final dividend is 4.25p for a total of 7.5p
(6.75p).

FT  11 APR 92 / UK Company News: Brierley in rescue of Europa Minerals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIR RON Brierley, the New Zealand entrepreneur, emerged yesterday with a
rescue package for Europa Minerals, the UK mining finance house.
The Europa board at the same time revealed that the principal bankers would
not have been prepared to provide facilities beyond March 31 this year in
the absence of firm proposals for refinancing.
Europa has signed an agreement with two companies in Sir Ron's orbit: GPG,
the UK investment group whose shares have been suspended in London since
December 1990, and Mid-East Minerals, an investment company quoted in
Australia in which GPG has a 86 per cent interest.
Mr David Hardy, chairman of Europa, suggested this 'represents the only
satisfactory proposal for Europa and will best secure its future.'
Europa will make an open offer and placing to raise Pounds 3.1m net, on the
basis of 3-for-1 at 3p per share.
New shares not taken up will be placed with or by MEM. However, the Europa
directors are asking for a waiver of the requirement for MEM to make a full
takeover offer, as required in the UK, should its holding go above 29.9 per
cent.
After the news the Europa share price fell by 4p to 5p. The company was
floated in February 1989 at 100p a share.
Europa also reported a loss before tax of Pounds 2.99m for the year to
January 31 1992, down from Pounds 3.89m previously. Debts at the year-end
were Pounds 5.8m.
Mr Hardy said that, while the share issue would improve Europa's position,
it would remain under some financial pressure and shareholders should bear
this in mind when deciding whether to take up their rights.
Existing shareholders could retain an interest in the group via warrants to
be issued without payment on the basis of 3-for-5 ordinary shares. The
warrants could be swapped at 7p a share at specific times during the next
five years.
Europa would use the proceeds from the open offer to reduce borrowing
facilities by Pounds 1.5m, to further cut overhead costs and to implement
its future strategy.
GPG and MEM had indicated that they would provide financial support for
suitable projects and investments by Europa. Bankers were continuing to
provide finance and had agreed in principal to provide two new term loans.
Austmin Gold, which owns 14.4 per cent of Europa and recently demanded
representation on the board, said it was looking at the proposals and
considering its position.

FT  11 APR 92 / UK Company News: Serco pays Pounds 12m on move into civil
aviation services
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER

<TEXT>
SERCO GROUP, which provides management and systems for contracts as diverse
as Ministry of Defence radars and one in three of London's traffic lights,
is moving into civil aviation services with the purchase of International
Aeradio, a subsidiary of British Telecommunications, for Pounds 12.25m.
International Aeradio employs 900 people and provides management and systems
for airports, flight information centres and air traffic control. Serco has
provided similar services before, but only to private operators like the
MoD. Mr George Gray, chairman of Serco, said: 'IAL provides a logical
extension to what we have been doing.'
In the year to March 31 1991 IAL incurred a loss of Pounds 969,000 from
turnover of Pounds 32.5m. However, Serco is not buying certain loss-making
health operations and Mr Gray said IAL was now profitable.
More than half of IAL's turnover comes from overseas. The company's main
foreign market is in the Middle East, where it has contracts which include
the provision of airport services to Abu Dhabi, Dubai and Bahrain.
IAL also provides air traffic control services at the Southend, Liverpool
and Cranfield airports in the UK.

FT  11 APR 92 / UK Company News: Littlewoods calls off talks to sell home
shopping side
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LITTLEWOODS, the privately-owned retailing and football pools group, said
yesterday that was no longer in talks to sell its home shopping division.
It had been in discussions with Quelle, the German mail order group which is
also a family run business.
Littlewoods said the mail order business was the jewel in the crown of its
retail activities - it has about 22 per cent of the UK mail order market,
running six catalogues and selling to 6m customers.
The group had never made the decision to sell, but had simply listened to
overtures. It now wanted to end uncertainty which had unsettled staff.
During last year two other large UK mail order groups changed hands. Grattan
was bought by Otto Versand of Germany, and Empire Stores went to Redoute
Catalogue of France.
Littlewoods had appointed Kleinwort Benson, the merchant bank, to handle
negotiations in January last year. However, it appears that a price high
enough to entice it to sell was not forthcoming. Speculation was that
Littlewoods was seeking at least Pounds 500m.
Although a number of parties were interested initially, Littlewoods stopped
talking to buyers other than Quelle last autumn. Discussions appear to have
been spasmodic and were eventually broken off this week.
Observers said that talks had centred on a gradual sale of the business,
with Quelle buying a stake in the division initially and later buying the
rest at a price determined by future profits. Talks had cooled, though, as
neither side felt a strong need to do the deal.
Littlewoods said yesterday that its gearing was negligible and it had easy
access to bank loans, so it did not need to raise cash through a sale.
The group, still headed by Sir John Moores, the 96-year-old founder and
president, is also determined not to go public.
Littlewoods will be reporting results for 1991 on April 27 and is expected
to have bucked the dismal retail trend in 1991.
The group showed a strong rise in pre-tax profits in 1990, from Pounds 64.9m
to Pounds 94.8m, with home shopping making a trading profit of Pounds 53.5m
(Pounds 51.7m) out of total retail trading profits of Pounds 83.6m (Pounds
73.2m).

FT  11 APR 92 / UK Company News: Chelsea football club may face winding-up
order
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CABRA ESTATES, the heavily-indebted property company, has warned that
Chelsea football club may be wound up as part of its efforts to force the
club either to buy its west London ground or leave it.
Chelsea did not come up with the Pounds 22.85m purchase price for the
Stamford Bridge ground by Thursday's deadline, set as part of a contract
backed by recent High Court and Court of Appeal rulings. The club has said
it intends to appeal to the House of Lords, but Cabra said yesterday this
did not entail delaying the completion date.
If a winding up order is granted, a court-appointed liquidator would sell
Chelsea's assets, including players, to pay off creditors of which Cabra is
the largest.
However, negotiations have continued on the sale of SB Property, the
subsidiary that owns Stamford Bridge, to Chelsea. It is understood that Mr
John Duggan, Cabra's chairman, will meet Mr Ken Bates, Chelsea's chairman,
on Sunday. Both sides were making positive noises yesterday about the
possibility of a deal being struck.
Early this week Cabra turned down an offer from Chelsea which was believed
to include the payment of up to Pounds 13m cash and the settlement of
inter-company debt. One sticking point has been that Cabra was not convinced
that Chelsea had access to sufficient funds to do a deal. Yesterday, it said
there was some indication that the money might be available.
Another possible route to a deal would involve Chelsea paying, say, Pounds
13m cash and relieving Cabra of its obligation to pay Fulham football club
roughly Pounds 8m to leave its Cravan Cottage ground to clear the way for
redevelopment. Both Fulham and Chelsea have said they would be happy to
share the Stamford Bridge ground.
The relationship between Mr Bates and Cabra has been complicated by his
Pounds 3m purchase of a 29.6 per cent stake in the property company, through
an investment vehicle called Vanbrugh. This has enabled him to call for an
extraordinary general meeting, notice of which is due to go out to
shareholders next week. One of the EGM proposals is to oust Mr Duggan as
chairman.

FT  11 APR 92 / UK Company News: Lilley to withdraw from property joint
ventures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LILLEY, the Glasgow-based construction and contracting company, is close to
disposing of its share of five property joint ventures in a move which would
signal a significant withdrawal from property development for the company.
Lilley announced yesterday that it expected negotiations on the sales to be
complete by Thursday and it was therefore delaying the announcement of
results for the year to December 31 until the same day.
The joint ventures have been developed in partnership with London &amp;
Edinburgh Trust, the probable purchaser. They include industrial and
commercial property in Scotland and England and account for the bulk of
Lilley's UK property holdings.
The unwinding of the joint ventures was welcomed by one analyst who said
cash raised from the sale would reduce Lilley's gearing, which is estimated
at 30 per cent at year end. The shares gained 0.5p to 28.5p for a gain of
3.5p on the day.
However, there were concerns the book values of some of the properties may
be higher than their disposal value because of recession in UK property.
This may lead to a provision being made as part of the disposal.
Last October, Lilley announced sharply increased losses on property
development of Pounds 3.5m (Pounds 1.3m) for the six months to June 30 as
projects were completed but failed to find enough tenants. Two properties
Lilley is preparing to pull out of, one in Chelsea, London and an office
development in Stoke Poges, Buckinghamshire, were partly to blame for the
losses.

FT  11 APR 92 / UK Company News: 'Crown jewels' placed on the first flight
out - BAe's attempts to find a partner for its corporate jet business
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH Aerospace's profitable corporate jets business has long been
regarded as one of the 'crown jewels' of the company's commercial aircraft
activities.
But yesterday it became the first target of the group's sweeping efforts to
restructure its aerospace activities around the core military aircraft and
large commercial airliner operations.
BAe's announcement that it was looking for a majority partner for the
business. It is forming a new company, Corporate Jets, incorporating its
business jet activities at Hatfield and Chester, employing about 1,200
people, to enable the sale to go ahead.
The move has set in motion the recovery strategy outlined last autumn at the
time of the flopped Pounds 432m rights issue. The strategy involved the
disposal of all businesses considered to be outside the core aircraft,
defence, cars and property operations.
In commercial aircraft the company indicated it wanted to focus on its 20
per cent participation in the European Airbus airliner programme, while
finding partners for the loss-making regional aircraft activities and
possibly shedding its corporate jets operations.
Earlier this year it split the commercial aircraft side into three
divisions, Airbus, region-al aircraft and corporate jets.
BAe remains confident of the long-term prospects of Airbus despite the
announcement yesterday that Airbus was planning to cut production of its
150-seater A320 twin-engine airliner by a total of 27 aircraft in 1993 and
1994 because of the current sluggish market for narrowbody jetliners.
The decision marks an end of an era. BAe and two of its former constituent
parts, de Havilland and Hawker Siddeley, have been manufacturing corporate
jets for almost 30 years.
Though profitable, the business was always a relatively small part of the
group. And, more significantly, BAe is faces the prospect of having to
invest considerable funds to develop new products at a time when its
resources have been stretched by its restructuring programme, the recession
in most of its main markets, and the investment needs.
BAe's intention is that the majority holder should be prepared to put in the
necessary long-term investment while it maintains a minority interest to
reassure and preserve its large and loyal corporate aircraft customer base.
The success of the corporate jet division has been based on the 125
medium-sized twin-engine jet, first developed by de Havilland 27 years ago
and ley. BAe currently manufacturers two eight-to-ten seater variants, the
125-800 and the BAe 1000, its latest model with a trans-atlantic range
launched in 1989.
Over the years, there have been some 10 different versions. In all, BAe has
sold a total of 816 of which about 500 have gone to North America,
traditionally the biggest market for corporate jets.
With the present models the company commands a leading position in the
medium-sized corporate jet market with a share of between 45 per cent and 50
per cent.
The aircraft have continued to sell strongly, even in the last difficult 12
months of recession. But during the next few years, BAe would have had to
consider launching a new aircraft to remain competitive.
Other manufacturers are studying the development of a new business jet with
trans-pacific range aimed largely at the US-Japan market. It was difficult
to see how BAe could adapt yet again the old 125 airframe to develop the new
model for this important market. The only option was to build a completely
new aircraft.
'We recognised we would have to launch a new aircraft to remain successful,'
said a BAe executive yesterday. 'That would have involved significant new
investment.'
BAe said it had so far not held any serious talks. But it should find little
difficulty in negotiating a deal. The business aircraft market has recently
seen a spate of mergers and acquisitions with several groups seeking to
strengthen their position.
The most recent was the sale in January by the US General Dynamics defence
group of its Cessna corporate aircraft subsidiary to Textron for Dollars
600m after a heated auction. Cessna's Citation jets compete against the BAe
125.
Dassault of France, which produces the Falcon range of business jets, had
bid for Cessna and is likely to be a candidate for the BAe business.
BAe's search for a partner for its loss-making regional aircraft activities
is likely to prove more difficult. The company has already had preliminary
talks with Japanese manufacturers over a possible partnership in its BAe 146
regional jet operations.
There have also been talks with European manufacturers which are seeking to
rationalise an industry suffering from overcapacity and a soft market
because of the financial difficulties of smaller airlines.
Pressure has been increasing on BAe to find a partner for the regional
business because of the attempts by Deutsche Aerospace, the aerospace arm of
Germany's Daimler-Benz car group, to forge a strong equity partnership with
Fokker, the Dutch regional aircraft manufacturer.
Alenia of Italy has also acquired a 6 per cent stake in Fokker, which could
constitute the basis of a new European regional aircraft grouping.
While working to disengage itself from the corporate jet business and
eventually, the industry suspects, from regional aircraft, BAe now appears
increasingly interested in increasing its role and participation in the
Airbus programme.
It is an ironic turnaround. Barely two years ago, BAe's top management was
expressing grave doubts about Airbus and its potential liabilities. Today,
it sees Airbus as one of the high-spots in its portfolio of businesses.

<TEXT>
Sir, Your leader, 'New challenges for Mr Mieno' (April 1), graphically
describes the effects of over-reaction to the age of inflation. As you say,
'last year's hero risks turning into today's villain'.
Your comments apply all the more to the UK. The terrifying consequences of
clinging to the wholly inappropriate discipline of the ERM in terms of flow
or zero economic growth and scandalous rises in unemployment for years to
come are just not being debated. Why not?
The level of currency is an effect not a cause. Winston Churchill discovered
this in the late 1920s when obliged to drop the Gold Standard.

FT  11 APR 92 / Letter: Short-term corporate planning that leaves a lot to
be desired
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr ALAN MACDOUGALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The FT/Mori survey ('Smith's budget fails to impress industry chiefs',
April 8) was a profoundly depressing example of short-termism by companies.
If a third of the survey's respondents had been considering cutting back on
investment plans if Labour had won the election, then their corporate
planning leaves a lot to be desired.
Companies constantly bemoan the City and financial institutions for their
short-termism. What are these companies doing if not the same?
Was not the British public told by Conservative governments of the 1980s
that industrialists were striving to be competitive and build up their
businesses over the long-term so as to increase profits and rewards to
shareholders?
Our pension fund clients would be seriously concerned about the companies in
your survey having intended to commit collective suicide by abandoning
attempts to be competitive with other businesses. That is what cut-ting
capital expenditure implies.
Our pension fund clients would be further astounded to realise that
corporate strategy is completely abandoned in the face of short-term
political expediency rather than responsive to the opportunities of
long-term sustainable growth in their markets.
Companies desperate to cut their workforces, dividends and capital
expenditure in the event of a Labour government having been elected, cannot
have been paying attention to the manifestos of either of the three main
parties, or to that other determinant of democracy in Britain - the
electorate.
This is perhaps not surprising if one recalls that the attitude of company
boards to their own shareholders is not one of vibrant account-ability.
Let us hope that this short-termism does not prevail.

FT  11 APR 92 / Letter: Reversing property spiral
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr M A MOORE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Vanessa Houlder's article on the UK property market ('Towers of
strength turn to pillars of sand', April 2) makes no mention of regional
differences in the UK and no mention of areas, such as here in south Wales,
where we are assisted by the pro-active Welsh Development Agency and by
positive council assistance in certain office and industrial developments.
Given realistic banking support, we, as developers, can counter the problems
London and the south-east face by offering bankers developments they feel
'safe' with, end-users a realistically priced product, investors a
satisfactory yield and workers a superb environment.
Unfortunately the well publicised problems of several developers in London,
our current political insecurity, the banks' perceived exposure to property
generally and our innate ability to look inward, conspire to produce a
downward spiral. Surely it is within our capabilities to reverse the
position, particularly here in areas such as south Wales.

FT  11 APR 92 / Letter: Fax of life and bad planning
</HEADLINE>

   From Mr NIGEL PARKHURST

<TEXT>
Sir, I have always been a non-believer in the advantages to organisation
provided by the fax machine, and note that this scepticism has seldom been
so well illustrated as in the first three sentences of your article, 'The
changing fax of life' (April 6).
'It is already late in the evening and you have only just finished putting
together the action plan for tomorrow's annual meeting. Branch managers
scattered throughout the country are waiting anxiously for their copies to
be faxed to them.'
'No need to panic.'
Perhaps not 'panic', but there is every cause to be seriously alarmed when
managers are kept late at their offices for no better reason than that their
superiors do not plan their own workload properly.

FT  11 APR 92 / Election 1992: Economic boost from the ballot box - Will the
Conservative victory lift Britain out of its current recession?
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Conservatives' surprise general election victory has strengthened the
chances of a durable economic recovery in Britain.
Against all the pundits' predictions, the government has been given a second
chance to achieve what was in its grasp after the election in 1987. If Mr
Major has learnt anything from the difficulties of the past three years, it
will be that his overriding economic priority must be to lock the country
into steady non-inflationary growth and bring the economic and political
cycles back into synchronisation.
The realisation that the Tories would have a clear majority brought sharp
gains in equities, bonds and sterling yesterday. Indeed, the Bank of England
sold so many government gilt edged securities by yesterday lunchtime that it
had funded Pounds 5bn of the Pounds 28bn government budget deficit forecast
for 1992-93 in the first 10 days of the financial year.
But the City's euphoria was tempered by the realisation that this particular
election victory does not presage a new economic boom and that much remains
to be achieved before the recession can be considered at an end.
Unemployment will continue to rise for some months yet. Bankruptcies and
company liquidations will continue at a high rate. Families will still be
subject to the trauma of house repossessions.
But Mr Major's new government will be able to build on some promising signs
of economic recovery that were overshadowed in the excitement of the
election campaign. The victory 'should boost consumer confidence which is
the key to bringing the recession to an end,' Sir John Banham,
Director-General of the Confederation of British Industry said yesterday.
Over the past fortnight, three business surveys - from business information
group Dun &amp; Bradstreet, the Institute of Directors and the UK Institute of
Purchasing and Supply - have carried the same message of revived business
confidence and increased orders and sales. Company liquidity has improved,
indicating increased resources for investment.
Better news has come from the High Street: retail sales volumes have edged
higher for two months and consumer confidence indicators have risen. Helping
business and consumer confidence, Britain's annual rate of inflation
continues to fall.
The election result means that Mr Norman Lamont's March Budget, with its
modest reductions in income tax for all and its limited stimulus for small
businesses and industry, can fully take effect. Labour's threat of sharply
higher taxes on people earning more than Pounds 22,000 a year has been
banished.
Labour's tax plans posed a particular threat to the economy of the affluent
south east of England, which accounts for 35 per cent of UK gross national
product.
The return of the Tories with a clear majority is expected to unblock an
unquantifiable but potentially large mass of investment and consumer
spending held up for fear of a Labour victory. The car industry and the
housing market are two crucial areas of the economy that expect to benefit.
Mr David Gent, head of the Retail Motor Industry Federation, said the result
'should stimulate the economy in general and the car market in particular.'
He predicted that it would release 'considerable pent-up demand' and provide
the retail motor trade with 'a busy time in the coming months'.
According to Mr Jim Birrell, chief executive of the Halifax, Britain's
biggest building society, the end of election uncertainty was good news for
the housing market. 'Confidence should now return with more house sales and
a gradual recovery in prices,' he said. 'The fundamentals are in place,
affordability is back to mid-1980s levels, interest rates have come down and
should fall further and the removal of the threat of higher taxes will help
the important southern housing market, which has been hardest hit by the
slump.'
Housing market transactions collapsed last year to around 1.3m from 2m in
1988, contributing significantly to last year's record 1.7 per cent drop in
consumption. Mr Peter Spencer, UK economist of Lehman Brothers International
in London, believes that transactions could now recover to 1.7m next year,
adding about 1 per cent to total consumption in Britain.
Some analysts expect house prices will recover as turnover in the housing
market picks up. Mr John Wriglesworth, who specialises in housing at
stockbrokers UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, said he expects house prices should stop
falling by mid year and then rise by 5 per cent in the second half with
further gains of 6 per cent in 1993.
That would go some way to alleviating the financial fragility that has been
a steadily growing feature of the UK economy in the long recession. Falling
house and commercial property prices have chipped away at individual and
corporate wealth, putting bank balance sheets under strain and raising the
spectre that Britain might be caught in a downward spiral of debt-deflation
that would frustrate other forces of recovery.
Such fears put pressure on the UK authorities to cut interest rates even
before the Conservative victory. This fueled hopes of an early cut in bank
base rates from the current 10.5 per cent. On the domestic money market, the
three month interbank rate, which often acts as a bellwether for base rates,
tumbled to around 10 3/8 per cent yesterday afternoon from around 10 3/4 per
cent the day before. But the Bank of England gave no hint in its money
market operations that a rate cut was imminent.
To some extent, the Bank's reticence indicated a wish to see calmer
conditions in financial markets before deciding on rates. There was also no
incentive for the Bank to act ahead of the announcement of Mr Major's
cabinet and a decision as to whether Mr Lamont should continue as
chancellor.
But other considerations are likely to encourage a cautious approach to
interest rate cuts. The problems that Mr Nigel Lawson brought on himself and
the last government by easing monetary and fiscal policy in the wake of the
1987 general election will be engraved on Mr Major's heart. Britain is still
in a long recession caused by the high interest rates that were needed to
curb the inflationary excesses that resulted from the mistakes of Mr Lawson
and Mrs Thatcher. At the very least, the prime minister will want to ensure
that he does not have to fight another general election with political and
economic cycles out of synchronisation.
As the new government has a secure majority, there is no need to court the
electorate. A modest cut in rates may be announced in the coming weeks if,
as expected, sterling maintains its strength. But Britain's membership of
the European exchange rate mechanism sets a limit to the amount that UK
rates can fall so long as Germany's interest rates are held high to combat
inflation.
Although the government wants a recovery, the authorities may prefer to see
how far the forces unleashed by Mr Major's victory can stimulate economic
growth. There will also be a temptation among officials to argue that the
government should take this opportunity to crush inflation once and for all
with a view to entering the narrow 2.25 per cent band of the ERM at
sterling's present DM2.95 parity during Britain's presidency of the European
Community in the second half of this year.
According to Mr Michael Saunders, UK economist of Salomon Brothers in
London, Britain would then be ideally placed to cut its bank base rates in
the second half of this year when Germany should at last be able to cut its
own key interest rates.
Much can go wrong with this rosy scenario. The US recovery could falter and
recessionary forces in Germany and Japan could strengthen. The danger of a
crisis on world financial markets can never be ignored.
But Mr Major's unexpected victory holds out the hope that his premiership
will see Britain enter an era of stable non-inflationary growth, and so
realise a goal which has eluded successive governments for more than 30
years.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Sir, I was mystified by Max Loppert's claim that the London concert season
in recent years has become 'a good deal less rich in term of novelty . . .
variety and chance-taking' ('Musical jewels in tawdry settings', March 28).
It seems but yesterday that the South Bank Centre in particular was being
berated for precisely such adventurous 'chance-taking' programming. We did,
after all, put on for the first time every, anywhere, the complete works of
Schoenberg and introduced to London the first substantial appraisals of
Elliott Carter, Szymanowski, Ligeti, Maxwell Davies and others, as well as
our 'Brave New Worlds' modernism festival.
I feel in a no-win situation. Help] Where do we go next?

FT  11 APR 92 / Leading Article: Full term at Number 10
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ELECTION result is an extraordinary personal achievement for Mr John
Major. He held his nerve when his campaign faltered and his low-key,
matter-of-fact approach proved in the end more impressive to voters than
Labour's glitz. Whatever they told the pollsters, people were not prepared
to trust Mr Kinnock's new model Labour party with the legacy of Thatcherism,
even in a recession.
Mr Major now has the authority and the opportunity to make a distinctive
mark at home and on the world stage. It took Mrs Thatcher a whole first term
to recover from recession and build a personal team; it was only when she
had done this that the great achievements of her second term between 1983
and 1987 became possible.
Mr Major's character-forming battles in the Gulf, at Maastricht and in the
domestic economy have been compressed into a shorter period, and have been
fought without a personal mandate from the voters. His job now is to
translate into much clearer policy terms the vision of a country more at
ease with itself, which he proclaimed for a second time yesterday on the
pavement of Downing Street.
Mr Major was chosen by his party 16 months ago because he appeared to
represent a bridge between the radical insights of Thatcherism and a
necessary, less confrontational period of reconstruction, especially in the
public services. The Tory manifesto failed to distinguish the main lines of
this vision from a cluttered landscape of random projects: it was the work
of a party which had not found time to set its post-Thatcherite priorities.
Such time for contemplation is always at a premium for a party in
government, but with a full term available to him Mr Major would be well
advised to spend this summer thinking, along with the team announced this
weekend.
Open mind
The foundation of this policy agenda must be sound public finance and an
open mind. In spite of the frolics in the financial markets yesterday, tough
circumstances lie ahead for the British economy which will require real
strength of purpose in Downing Street. The faltering recovery now under way
can be boosted by a swift, if modest, cut in interest rates, since there is
no longer a serious political difficulty in putting rates back up again
should conditions make that necessary.
But Mr Major's unbreakable commitment to low inflation and the exchange rate
mechanism, set alongside continuing pressures in the German economy, mean
high real interest rates and rising unemployment are bound to persist. The
prime minister now has enough time to demonstrate that this policy will
eventually bring rewards, although it will also mean public spending
sacrifices along the way. His chancellor, Mr Norman Lamont, has had a
difficult election campaign, but is well qualified to see the task through.
An early political challenge will be the European Community, of which
Britain assumes the presidency this summer. With a move towards the right
and a series of leadership changes ahead in Community countries, Mr Major is
in a good position to play a leading role. He will rightly resist some
attempts to increase the powers of the centre, but he must be prepared for
deft footwork on foreign policy, defence and some aspects of social policy.
In return, Britain can help build an enlarged community characterised by
strong internal competition and a commitment to global free trade.
Own interests
At home, Thursday's results must not be taken as a mandate to put aside all
need to rethink the way the country is governed, both at central and local
authority level. No one can expect the government to act against its own
interests by proposing the kind of electoral reforms which its opponents may
now see as the only way back into power. But Mr Major sensibly acknowledged
yesterday that he would need to take stock of opinion in Scotland.
Improvement in public services, whether in health, education, training or
other areas of local authority provision requires a twin-track approach:
decentralisation and contracting out, which the Conservatives have
pioneered, and appropriately accountable supervision. The proliferation of
quangos, so depressingly unchecked in the manifesto, needs to be resisted
and, where it cannot be, appointments should be made from a wide spectrum of
society.
It is not necessary to buy proportional representation or wholesale
constitutional reform to recognise that restoring the health of local
government and its relationship with Whitehall is an essential part of
running the country well. Problems like homelessness can only be resolved by
effective co-operation between central and local government. Getting this
right is at least as important as a lorry load of citizen's charters.
Mr Major is a consensus-minded politician, but if he is to achieve his
objectives for society he will need to step beyond his party's prejudices on
issues like transport, the environment, urban development and local
government. There is a need for the sort of radicalism that stirs up trouble
and requires skilful salesmanship. The prime minister should hang on to that
soapbox.

FT  11 APR 92 / Banks and big stores get wild about cards: Electronic
transactions have aroused anger about their cost
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BARCHARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SQUABBLES between banks and the large retail chains about the pricing of
transactions made with credit and debit cards have become almost a way of
life in the past few years.
Each side sees itself as the underdog in the dispute. The retailers say they
are being forced to pay excessive charges while struggling to get out of the
recession. The banks see themselves as the victims of a media witch-hunt
which ignores the fact that they set up the payment systems used by the
retailers and that they still pay for most fraud losses on card payments.
So Mr David Malpas, managing director of Tesco, provoked cries of anger and
pain from the banks when he pointed out this week that his company is being
asked to pay substantially more when a customer pays by debit card than for
a cheque payment.
Mr Malpas's threat that the retailers might press for a further Monopolies
and Mergers Commission inquiry into plastic card payments has cut no ice
with the banks.
Mr David Mills, direct banking director at Midland Bank, said yesterday:
'There have been two MMC investigations into credit cards in little more
than a decade and the banks emerged completely clean from them.'
Midland, Tesco's banker, refused to be drawn further on Mr Malpas's remarks
about pricing. Nevertheless, it is Midland's pricing policy for Switch, the
electronic debit card launched in 1988 by National Westminster, Midland and
Royal Bank of Scotland, that is at the heart of the row with the retailers.
Last year there were 169m Switch transactions in the UK and the scheme now
has 20 member banks and building societies in place of the original three.
Other payments through the rival Visa Delta scheme brought the UK total for
debit cards to 390m.
That is still a small number compared with the 2.7bn payments consumers made
by cheque last year, but it is rising rapidly. By 1995 there are expected to
be about 750m Switch payments a year, bringing the goal of substituting
electronic payments for cheques very much closer.
By the year 2000, when Switch is expected to be processing 1.5bn
transactions a year, that goal may have been reached. The trouble is that
although Switch is growing fast, it has also until very recently been losing
money for the banks that set it up.
Mr David Jessop, Midland Bank money transmission director, says: 'Switch was
a completely new mechanism, and we sustained losses on it for three years
even though it has been held at constant prices.'
Midland's partners among the other Switch banks privately accuse it of
offering Switch at unrealistically low prices when the scheme was launched
in its attempts to grab market share. The price each retailer pays for
cheque or debit card processing is negotiated separately. Small businesses
pay most, while the very large retail chains can drive bargains in which
prices are pared to the minimum.
Midland charged its largest customers such as Tesco a flat rate of between
4p and 5p a transaction. By contrast, Lloyds, which never pursued card
services for the larger retailers but went mainly after middle-sized
companies, is believed to charge a flat rate of between 20p and 30p.
That perhaps helps to explain why this week Lloyds stood aside from the
latest row with the retailers, contenting itself with a statement that since
its pricing had never been unrealistic, it had not been forced to raise its
card charges to retailers.
Visa debit card issuers charge higher debit card fees than the Switch
consortium banks, mainly because - although Visa debit cards are also
intended to be mainly used in electronic terminals - they can be also used
with the original generation of hand-operated credit card vouchers. That
gives the Visa debit card issuers a significant competitive advantage over
Switch with smaller retailers.
Even so, Barclays, the largest credit and debit card issuer, has also put up
its Connect Visa debit card from an average of 10.5p to 12p. The latest
price is still substantially below the 17.5p that Barclays charged when
Connect was launched in 1987.
By comparison, the largest retailers are paying only 4p on their cheques.
Even allowing that the very smallest retailers pay far more than that - as
much as 63p a cheque, according to Barclays - something seems to be wrong.
The introduction of electronic technology was supposed to drive costs down
by eliminating paper and the people needed to process it. Why have the banks
ended up by charging retailers substantially more for electronic payments?
The question is not one that all banks are willing to discuss. Some fear
that if details of their policies entered the public domain, they might face
a revolt from smaller retailers that would dwarf the troubles they already
have with the large supermarkets.
'For the vast majority of retailers, Switch is cheaper than cheques,' says
Royal Bank of Scotland, one of the founder members of Switch. 'The big
retailers who have negotiated extremely low charges per cheque are the
exception.'
All the banks argue that debit cards and electronic payments are far
superior to cheques, but their advantages push up their costs.
One is that retailers get immediate payment while the cardholder's account
is not debited for two or three days. The bank then has to pay for making
the money available during that period.
Another is that the debit cards are more secure than cheques and can be used
to purchase unlimited amounts. Most cheque guarantee cards are still limited
to Pounds 50. A further debit card advantage is that they substantially
reduce the time and cost of office work for retailers.
On past form however, nothing except low bank charges is likely to appease
the retailers.

FT  11 APR 92 / Final few Tecs to discuss contracts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HIGH ON the list of priorities at the Department of Employment next week
will be talks with the 16 Training and Enterprise Councils that have not yet
negotiated contracts for delivering training schemes in 1992-93.
Tecs generally have been concerned about the level of funding of schemes.
One such scheme is Youth Training; another is Employment Training, which is
designed for the adult long-term unemployed.
The negotiations next week will be with the 16 that held out for increased
funding at a time of government cuts in budgets. The Labour party had
promised restitution of cuts. Negotiations were temporarily halted during
the election campaign.
Tecs that have not renegotiated contracts with the government have
temporarily contracted with providers of training.
North London Tec, which encompasses the boroughs of Haringey, Enfield and
Barnet, said its temporary contracts were resulting in a 19 per cent
reduction in the volume of training for the long-term unemployed at a time
when their numbers were increasing in its area.
Nine of the 16 are London Tecs. The biggest single issue facing them is
underfunding, according to an article by Mr Michael Hanson, chief executive
of South Thames Tec.
Writing in special report of the Policy Studies Institute, Mr Hanson said:
'Training in London has been underfunded in the past. No weighting has been
given to meet the inevitable costs in the capital. Additional resources will
be needed if the Tecs are to fulfil the tasks laid upon them.
The combination of low funding and the particular requirements of the London
market, he wrote, had produced a downward spiral of low uptake, poor image
and increasing cost pressure on individual training schemes. 'Establishing a
more realistic level of funding is crucial.'
