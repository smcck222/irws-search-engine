FT  09 APR 92 / Banker may quit O&amp;Y debt role
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR TOM JOHNSON, the banker brought in to spearhead the reorganisation of
Olympia &amp; York's Dollars 20bn (Pounds 11.6bn) debt, is expected to give up
his role as chairman of O&amp;Y's committee in charge of negotiations with 200
banks just two weeks after being appointed.
Mr Johnson is also likely to step down as president of O&amp;Y's main operating
subsidiary, Olympia and York Developments.
O&amp;Y is not expected to appoint a new president of O&amp;Y Developments. Mr Paul
Reichmann, O&amp;Y's founder, will be left firmly in control of the property
group.
Mr Johnson's abrupt change of role has caused consternation among bankers.
However, both Mr Johnson and Mr Reichmann have told sources close to the
talks that there has not been 'a bust-up' between them.
In 1991, Mr Johnson resigned as president of the New York bank,
Manufacturers Hanover, when it agreed to merge with its local rival Chemical
Bank. His original appointment at O&amp;Y was welcomed by bankers who have a
high regard for him.
Bankers in the core group, led by Canadian Imperial Banking Corporation,
Citicorp and Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Group, said yesterday they were
anxious that banks outside the inner circle should not be unsettled by this
change.
Agreement has not yet been reached on the precise scope of Mr Johnson's new
role, though O&amp;Y stressed that he will continue to be involved. However, a
banker said yesterday that he would be 'taking a back seat'.
The lead in formulating the reconstruction plan has, in practice, been taken
by Mr Steve Miller, a partner in the investment bank, James D Wolfensohn. As
a result, Mr Miller will replace Mr Johnson as chairman of the planning and
finance committee.
Mr Miller played a vital role in the financial reorganisation of Chrysler,
the US automotive manufacturer, a decade ago.
Around 300 bankers are due to meet in Toronto on Monday, a week later than
originally planned, to hear details of O&amp;Y's debt rescheduling proposals. It
is understood O&amp;Y will make an announcement about Mr Johnson's change of
role before then.

FT  09 APR 92 / Election poised on knife-edge: Opinion polls indicate
last-minute swing from Labour to Tories
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A LAST-MINUTE swing from Labour to the Conservatives left the outcome of
today's general election balanced on a knife-edge last night with the last
batch of opinion polls putting the two parties neck-and-neck.
Three eve-of-poll surveys suggested that Mr Neil Kinnock had lost the
two-point lead over Mr John Major which his party has held almost
continuously throughout the four-week campaign.
The polls, pointing to the most closely fought election since 1974,
indicated the two parties were level at 38 per cent, with Mr Paddy Ashdown's
Liberal Democrats at 20 per cent. A fourth survey gave Labour a three-point
lead but did nothing to dispel the uncertainty over the outcome.
If the surveys, which will trigger a desperate scramble for the votes of the
remaining waverers throughout today, are replicated in the election, the
result would be a hung parliament.
Depending on which side emerged with the largest number of seats and on the
terms they were ready to offer to smaller parties, that would leave open the
possibility of a Conservative or Labour minority government. It could also
force another general election within months.
But as Mr Ashdown continued to insist that the price for his support would
be a firm commitment to electoral reform, neither Mr Kinnock nor Mr Major
would contemplate that possibility.
Regional variations in voting patterns and the traditional statistical
margin of error in opinion polls mean it is still possible that one party
will emerge with an overall majority.
As the party leaders launched a final push for votes, all sides were
claiming that their own reports from the constituencies indicated that late
surges in support for their respective parties would give them that
majority.
But the latest batch of polls offered more comfort to Mr Major than to Mr
Kinnock. Labour's support has been steady at around 40 per cent for most of
the campaign, falling below that level only during the past few days.
Conservative strategists said Mr Major's warnings that a victory for Mr
Kinnock would wreck the prospects of economic recovery had given his party
momentum in the crucial phase of the campaign.
The mood of optimism in the Conservative camp was reflected in the FT
Election Share Index. It showed a slight move towards the Tories, after a
campaign that has seen a steady trend the other way.
Mr Kinnock said national polls had disguised his party's strength in the
main general election battlegrounds of London, the Midlands and the
north-west. His campaign team said regional and constituency surveys
indicated the swing to Labour from the Conservatives in marginal seats was
significantly above the 7 per cent shown in national polls.
Mr Ashdown, buoyed by indications that the Liberal Democrats may make strong
gains in its south-west heartlands, predicted that his party's actual vote
would exceed the 23 per cent achieved by the Liberal/SDP Alliance in 1987.
Anticipating a hung parliament, Mr Ashdown renewed his call for a coalition
government based on an agreed four-year programme of legislation including
the introduction of proportional representation.
A Gallup poll for today's Daily Telegraph puts the Conservatives at 38.5 per
cent, Labour at 38 per cent and the Liberal Democrats at 20 per cent. Mori
for The Times gives Labour a one-point lead with 39 per cent against the
Conservatives' 38 per cent and the Liberal Democrats' 20 per cent. ICM for
The Guardian puts the two main parties at 38 per cent each, with the Liberal
Democrats again on 20 per cent.
NOP for The Independent and BBC Newsnight has Labour on 42 per cent,
Conservatives on 39 per cent and Liberal Democrats 17 per cent. The FT's
poll of polls points to a hung parliament with Labour having a slightly
bigger share of the vote.
Today's voting marks the end of a frequently bitter election campaign in
which Mr Major has been dogged by the recession and the poll tax and Mr
Kinnock by his party's tax and spending plans. Only Mr Ashdown has increased
his party's support.
Mr Major concluded with a confident assertion that he was 'stone cold
certain' of an overall majority. Mr Kinnock made an eve-of-poll appeal to
the electorate to reject a 'Tory future of insecurity, run down and
division' and to invest a Labour government with the task of building a
Britain capable of a 'pacemaker in Europe'.

FT  09 APR 92 / Survey of Management Education and Training (9): A time of
reappraisal - Profile, Wharton
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AT THE end of a corridor in the Wharton School in Philadelphia hangs a
photograph of Donald Trump, the financier who made his fortune in the 1980s
and fell on harder times in the 1990s. Mr Trump is one of the alumni whose
achievements are still celebrated. Those of another, the disgraced Michael
Milken, are no longer so publicly applauded.
Wharton's power was undisputed in the 1980s, and remains enormous. It is one
of the three big US business schools that exert a tight grip on the world
market in management education - the others being Stanford and Harvard.
Among the three, Wharton's fortunes seem most bound to the past decade's
explosion of interest in free market business and finance.
The school was founded in 1881 by the Philadelphia financier Joseph Wharton.
It is part of the University of Pennsylvania - established by Benjamin
Franklin - yet its independent reputation and its financial strength set it
apart among the university's graduate schools. It is often regarded with a
mixture of awe and resentment by outsiders.
This is a time of reappraisal and self-analysis for Wharton. Its reputation
is as the best US finance school, and many of those who gained MBAs found
easy rewards in the 1980s bull market. At the same time, the number and size
of US business schools grew to the point where there is now over-capacity of
up to 10 per cent on some estimates.
So Wharton is attempting to redefine itself more in sympathy with the 1990s
zeitgeist, while holding on to its traditional strengths. It is a tricky
balancing act, symbolised most strongly by a new curriculum being tested out
for the first time this year on 130 of the intake of 830 students paying
Dollars 17,750 each a year to study for a two-year MBA.
These are also nervous times for many of the MBA students. Jobs are not as
easy to come by as they might have anticipated this year, and they came with
high expectations of what they would get for their money. As at other
business schools, there is a vociferous debate over the quality of the
teaching, and whether the MBA education is still worthwhile.
The man charged with steering this vast enterprise - with a faculty of 180
and a capital endowment of Dollars 98m Wharton is as much a large business
as a university graduate school - along an uncharted course is Mr Thomas
Gerrity, the dean. He has a vision of what Wharton should become, although
he acknowledges that it is easier said than done.
Mr Gerrity's view is that business schools should concentrate on giving
leadership skills not only to MBA students, but to undergraduates and
executives attending part-time courses. He thinks managers now have to be
able to integrate approaches from operations or marketing or finance to
solve a range of complex problems from early on in their careers.
'Managers now require great cognitive and analytical abilities, and enough
of the craft of leadership to follow their ideas through and deliver
actions,' he says. In practice, that presents a tall teaching order for an
academic institution which has divided teaching into separate functional
areas, and not bothered about blending ideas.
Wharton's main response has been to establish its new curriculum, which
tries to raise standards by adding a four-week preparatory course to the
start of the first year, and offers a series of six-week module courses
during the two semesters. The over-riding principle is a stronger emphasis
on interdisciplinary study of business strategy.
Those involved in the pilot curriculum say it had an uncertain start because
it involved a different approach from a faculty which was used to the old
ways. But some students now see benefits: Ms Andrea White, a first-year
student, talks enthusiastically of professors from different disciplines
debating business case studies in classes.
Wharton is careful to distinguish its approach from that of Harvard Business
School, known for using case studies and examples from business practice
rather than emphasising econometric rigour. Mr Anthony Santomero, the deputy
dean, says drily that Wharton uses case studies where it thinks them useful
rather than as 'a religious endeavour'.
But in the final analysis, Wharton may not be able to shape its destiny
alone. The demand for its services will depend on the overall market for
management education. Executive education is clearly booming - that side of
Wharton's business brought in Dollars 16m revenue last year - but the MBA
market is a more uncertain matter.
Mr Gerrity professes little concern about Wharton, but says the future for
US business schools depends on attracting a continuing stream of overseas
recruits. Twenty-nine per cent of the MBA intake last year were foreign. For
the moment, US schools hold as strong a market share in world business
education as Detroit used to in the world car market.
The dean does not believe this is likely to change rapidly, despite an
inevitable growth in competition from Europe and south-east Asia. 'There
will be more competition, but we are not going to see radical change
overnight. This is not the software industry,' he says.

FT  09 APR 92 / Survey of Management Education and Training (10): The
attraction of ethics / Finding a new subject on the syllabus
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FROM THE country that fostered Ivan Boesky and Michael Milken is a subject
coming to a management education syllabus near you soon: business ethics.
Under the surface of the profit motive, many executives of the future are
beginning to call for classes preparing them for wider responsibilities.
While the 1980s in the UK have been associated by many with a selfish
individualism driven by the spirit of private enterprise, an undercurrent of
corporate responsibility has also been on the rise.
Since the late 1970s in the US, business schools have been introducing
courses reflecting students' concerns with the ethical decisions they may
face day-by-day in corporations. Commentators say demand has been driven by
growing concern over a succession of corporate and political scandals which
emerged during the decade.
Now the same concerns are infiltrating courses in the UK and Europe. At a
conference in London last September, more than 100 academics and business
executives gathered to discuss subjects as diverse as ethics during a
recession, the slot machine and gambling industry, and Czechoslovak
attitudes to privatisation.
These initiatives have been foreshadowed by the growing interest in areas
such as ethical investment, better environmental practices and good
employment policies, which have given rise to a number of organisations and
an expanding literature over the past few years.
Professor Andrew Likierman at the London Business School recalls a group of
students approaching him in the early 1980s with an interest in discussing
ethical issues in the workplace as well as the more 'mechanical' skills
generally on offer in the curriculum. The school responded with an optional
course in 1987 which has run several times since and has been consistently
well attended.
Mr Brian Harvey, from the education department at Nottingham University and
secretary of the European Business Ethics Network and author of a study of
corporate social policy for managers, says: 'I definitely have the
impression that more business schools are offering courses now.'
Last year he ran a course in the university's school of management and
finance attended by 30 students. Now through the network he is involved in
the production of a number of case studies on European business ethics for
class teaching, to supplement the existing widely-used material which comes
from the US.
These include a study of the issues surrounding the marketing of RU 486, the
'morning-after' contraceptive developed in France, the tensions between a
chemical company and an environmental pressure group, and the difficulties
facing IBM managers in Germany trying to reconcile the need to make
redundancies at a plant which is no longer required with the company's
traditional commitment to employees and the local community.
He says much of the development of ethics in the US has been driven by the
strong sense of community involvement by business, in turn reflecting a
traditionally less active belief in the role of the state.
Prof Likierman argues that not only is business more central to society in
the US, but also people are more willing to be frank about the dilemmas they
may face at work. He says the subject is an important one, and beginning to
spread to the UK and elsewhere, but he adds: 'To be frank, it is not
absolutely the thing of the 1990s. It is not just a fashion, but neither has
it been very seriously tackled yet.'
Mr Kirk Hanson, senior lecturer at the Stanford business school in
California, says there is a great deal of interest from US corporations  -
many of which have now launched codes of ethics governing their operations.
He sees the biggest problem not as raising money to teach and research the
subject, but in finding people to teach it. Business ethics is still a
relatively unstructured academic specialism, and is often more controlled by
philosophers and theologians who have turned their attention to business
than by business school lecturers themselves.
Prof Likierman says there are also difficulties in deciding how to introduce
ethics into the curriculum. Theoretically, there are ethical issues which
ought to be discussed in every course on offer. 'But n o t everyone finds it
easy to teach, or is willing to find room by pushing out what they regard as
a central part of their course,' he says. In fact, most of the courses on
offer are not only demarcated rather than integrated, but also optional.
He is keen to dispel the notion that business ethics is about insider
dealing, however. 'That is a clear criminal act, not an ethical issue,' he
says. By contrast, he points to trading with South Africa - or, perhaps more
difficult, a right-wing dictatorship.
There may be sensible business reasons for not conducting such trade, such
as the higher risks involved. But will business with the regime help prop it
up, or will good practices help bring about reform more quickly? Similarly,
where does corporate hospitality cease and bribery begin? 'Morality and
business do not always conflict,' he says.
Mr Hanson agrees. 'Ethics is extremely complex. You very quickly get away
from a definition about law-breaking. It's primarily a question of balance
rather than about black and white,' he says.
Most academics introducing ethics into business school curricula stress that
they are not intending to provide students with rights and wrongs. What they
hope to do is offer students a chance to recognise and discuss the ethical
dimensions of the environment in which they work, and have the critical
ability to make better decisions as a result.
But in true business school style, ought they not now to be able to evaluate
and quantify the scale of their success? Are there any signs yet that the
new breed of ethically-trained managers are cleaning up business?
'It's hard to tell. We can't say there have been 43 per cent fewer
indictments among our graduates,' says Mr Hanson. But if interest from both
companies and students is anything to go by, the companies of the future
should be better equipped to address the most ancient of issues.

FT  09 APR 92 / Survey of Management Education and Training (8): Less
dreaming in the spires - Profile, Oxbridge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OXBRIDGE has just discovered the MBA. Twenty-five years after graduate
business education began to be taken seriously in Britain, its ancient
universities are finally, tentatively, putting their toes in the water.
Cambridge is first off the mark. It was closer to the line in the first
place, with a range of undergraduate management courses already running,
linked mainly to engineering but including a manufacturing and engineering
tripos dating back to the mid-1980s.
The university made a decisive shift last year when it launched a
fully-fledged management school, named the Judge Institute - after Mr Paul
Judge, former chairman of the food operation company Premier Brands, who
donated Pounds 8m to get it started. Other large benefactions have come from
Mr Simon Sainsbury of the retailing family (Pounds 5m) and accountants Peat
Marwick (Pounds 1.5m). 'Management education is a subject which has been
strangely neglected by our great universities,' said Mr Sainsbury pointedly
when announcing his gift.
The institute, currently in temporary premises opposite the Fitzwilliam
Museum, will move in a few years to a purpose-built complex on the Old
Addenbrooke's Hospital site in the city centre. The first 20 MBA students
arrived last October - half of them British, average age 28, all sponsored
by companies, and a majority working for international blue chip companies.
MBA numbers are expected to rise to 60 a year by the late 1990s. 'We are not
going to get in the business of having hundreds of students,' says Dr John
Hendry, director of the MBA programme. 'Our course is as much a management
development programme as a degree, involving close collaboration between
staff and sponsoring companies - that makes heavy demands on tutors.'
The MBA is an unusual three-year sandwich course. Students must be sponsored
by their employers: after an initial 10 weeks in Cambridge, they return to
their organisations for a year, when their work is supplemented by
supervised study programmes and three one-week sessions at Cambridge. A
second term is followed by another year of work and supervised study, and
the course is topped off with a final nine weeks at Cambridge. At Pounds
7,000 a year, the institute is not trading on its name unduly.
In addition to the MBA, Cambridge has also launched an M Phil programme: 19
students are in their first year, and about half are currently intending to
pursue research at the doctoral level afterwards. It also plans a range of
short executive courses, due to start at the end of next year.
Oxford has long been a serious player in the executive course market.
Templeton College, the university's management school, runs a small master's
course in business, but has devoted most of its energy to developing
management programmes. In 1990, courses generated 70 per cent of the
college's Pounds 3.7m income.
Its programmes are mostly commissioned by particular companies: regular
visitors include British Aerospace, Ford Europe, Thames Water, P&amp;O, United
Biscuits and the British Council Overseas - the last sponsoring a course
teaching Indian managers how to work in export markets.
Templeton, a nondescript campus founded in 1969, is three miles from the
dreaming spires - well beyond the city's ring road. It is the chosen
location for the large expansion of business studies planned by the
university for the next decade. A Pounds 40m expansion scheme has been
agreed: more than Pounds 5m has been raised to date, and fund-raising will
start in earnest once a director is chosen. An appointment is said to be
imminent - but since the college has been saying that for months, it appears
to have had difficulty finding a suitable 'big name'.
Oxford's MBA, due to be launched in October 1994, is an altogether more
ambitious venture than Cambridge's. From an initial intake of 40, an annual
entry of 150 is planned by the end of the decade. Doctoral students
included, the school will be about 600-strong, with a teaching faculty of
more than 50, plus 25 research fellows. That will make management the
largest of the university's graduate departments.
An expansion of undergraduate management courses is also planned, with an
economics and management bachelor's degree on offer from 1994.
Oxford's MBA is to be a two-year full-time degree. 'We think there is a role
for a two-year flagship course,' says Dr Derek Morris, one of its
architects. 'Few schools in Britain besides Manchester and LBS offer one at
the moment, and with a three- to six-month internship included, it offers
the right balance between theory and practice.'
The university is anxious to dispel any impression that Templeton's location
implies a marginal role for management studies in the future. About
two-thirds of the MBA students will be members of 'old' colleges, and most
of the faculty will hold fellowships in them too.
Perhaps Templeton will be for management what Nuffield, a graduate college
established in the 1930s, is for the social sciences: a focus and magnet,
primus inter pares for graduate studies in its field. But at least Nuffield,
with its monstrous tower, can be seen from Carfax. Templeton is 10 minutes
away by taxi - and some Oxford dons wish it was further still.

that says it all - Profile, London Business School
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IF Mr George Bain were given just a single word to encapsulate the London
Business School, there is little doubt which one he would choose. Talk to
the faculty and students, wander the buildings, or read the brochures, and
the theme is everywhere.
The word is 'international'. So much so that a party of visitors arriving
blind-folded from abroad at the grassy campus in Regent's Park, central
London, might not even realise which country they were in.
Mr Bain, the principal of the school, deserves his chosen word. A Canadian
with dual nationality, he says he spends much of his time defending Britain
to the British. But his vision for the school stretches far more to the west
over the Atlantic and south across the Channel than it does north into the
traditional industrial heartland of the UK.
'We are one of the top maybe 10 or 12 business schools in Europe and the
US,' he says without hesitation. 'This may sound self-serving, but I'd like
to think we combine the best American and European business school
traditions.'
The LBS, he suggests, has elements of the north American schools which
traditionally have a reputation for academic excellence, mixed with European
ones which are historically more focused on vocational skills.
He likens the school to an aircraft carrier, on which future business
leaders can land, re-orient themselves and then take off again in new
directions. Students from the US are partly driven to the LBS by the
over-academic focus of institutions in their own country, he suggests, and
partly as a way of becoming exposed to 'a wider Europe' while their language
skills may initially hold them back.
Conversely, many European students want a flavour of American business
without committing themselves to a full course there, Mr Bain argues.
'If you ever find a dean who says he is not internationalising his business
school, tell me,' he says. 'But I don't think any other British school is as
international as we are.' That, if anything, is the unique selling point of
the LBS, he says.
The statistics certainly go some way to bearing out this vision. Two-thirds
of the students on the full-time MBA degree are foreign nationals, and half
of those studying for PhDs. Even on the part-time MBA course 20 per cent are
not British, and a handful commute from continental Europe even for this
programme.
Mr Bain's drive to internationalise the school has led to radical changes in
the curriculum over the past few years, which he characterises by three
'I's. International is, of course, the first. The others are integrated and
dealing with implementation.
By integrated, he means providing a course which is coherent with
interdisciplinary teaching. 'Business schools have historically been far too
vertical,' Mr Bain says. 'Courses have been compartmentalised into
functional units, such as accounting, finance, production and marketing.
They then painted a little glue called strategy on top and hoped it all hung
together.'
By implementation, he refers to the need to switch emphasis from simply
problem-solving to providing solutions and the skills which allow managers
to put their recommendations into action. 'The MBA has traditionally been
longer on analysis and a bit short on process skills,' he says.
In addition, he talks about four specific aims for the school as a whole
over the next few years. The first - surprise, surprise] - is to enhance the
internationalism of LBS still further. While non-UK nationals are a high
proportion of students, he would like to see more foreigners among the
faculty.
Second, he places great emphasis on what he calls 'balanced excellence'  -
that teaching and research are of equal importance. He says the faculty
should be expected to gain visibility in the business community as much as
in the academic community - which, he adds in the same breath, they have
been doing.
Third, he wants to see further growth in some parts of the school, despite
its presence already as the largest in Europe. He says there needs to be 'a
bigger critical mass' in some specialisms such as accounting and marketing.
Finally, he calls for a much closer partnership with business through
'effective learning partnerships'. 'That reflects a recognition that there
is no substitute for the company as the learning laboratory,' he says.
All this management education does not come cheaply. The full-time MBA,
which currently enrols 210 people a year, costs Pounds 9,000. The part-time
equivalent at the moment costs Pounds 6,600 for each of three years.
There is also a wide range of more specialised courses to choose from,
ranging from Pounds 4,700 a year for a PhD and Pounds 13,000 for the
international executive master's programme to Pounds 20,000 for the Sloan
MSc degree.
To these costs students obviously have to add accommodation and forgone
earnings. Recently, those who are not sponsored have often had to face the
possibility of another risk, even at a school as highly-regarded as LBS:
unemployment.
The school's most recent annual report has rather more text and glossy
post-modern collages than it does figures. But one box showing the
destinations of the 176 MBAs graduating in 1991 includes 20 per cent in a
euphemistic 'other' category, which comprises 'freelance work, deciding on
offers and seeking employment'.
'It is taking people longer to find jobs,' Mr Bain concedes. 'MBAs are
finding it harder to get job opportunities than a few years ago. They have
to have to look harder. But the fact I don't know the proportion who are
unemployed is an indication of how serious I think the situation is.'
For those with the money, or sympathetic and education-committed employers,
an alternative is participation in the non-degree programmes stretching over
a number of days or weeks and costing a few thousand pounds each.
These cover subjects from corporate finance and brand strategy to one
dedicated entirely to discussing the issues raised in copies of the
Financial Times and the Wall Street Journal.

'THE ONLY thing French here is the food - and that's probably a good thing',
goes the quip at Insead, the European business school at Fontainebleau on
the edge of the Bourbon kings' renowned hunting forest.
L'Institut Europeen d'Administration des Affairs, Insead, may be 65km south
of Paris, but it could as easily be on the outskirts of Basle or Brussels,
given its success in downplaying the French connection. Teaching is mostly
in English and administration in French; but a stroll across the dining room
adds Spanish, Italian and Japanese (not German - symbolically enough for a
business school).
Insead claims to be the pre-eminent international business school, and is
now widely regarded as such.
The smaller International Institute for Management Development (IMD) in
Switzerland has a strong reputation; the Paris-based EAP's three-country
'pre-experience MBA' is highly rated; London Business School is rapidly
strengthening its international credentials; and the buzz-word
'internationalisation' reverberates across leading American campuses. But in
breadth, depth and output, Insead has a formidable claim to the crown.
'For us, international management education isn't a goal, it's a reality',
insists Mr Ludo Van der Heyden, Insead's co-dean. It is reflected in all
three of the institute's main divisions. Its 80-strong faculty is drawn from
more than 20 nationalities, 90 per cent of them holding at least one degree
from the United States. On executive programmes, the rule of thumb is that
no more than 16 per cent of participants on any one course are from the same
nationality.
MBA students are drawn fairly evenly from North America and the leading
European states - excepting Germany, which in 1990-91 had only 6 per cent to
match France's 16 per cent and Britain's 20 per cent. A tenth hail from Asia
and the Middle East. Typically, more than a third of each graduation go to
work in a country other than that of their passport.
To ice the cake, Insead also boasts a well-appointed Euro-Asia centre, with
five academic staffand a range of management development programmes based in
Europe and throughout Asia.
Not that Insead's top brass sees the international dimension as the be-all
and end-all. 'All programmes have to be more international, but that doesn't
mean that all tomorrow's managers will be truly international', says Mr Van
der Heyden. 'There's still plenty of room for the regional manager.'
Executive courses are Insead's breadwinner. Almost 60 per cent of last
year's total income of FF234m (Pounds 24m) came from executive courses.
Public programmes account for just over half of all participants: the rest
attend courses tailor-made for particular companies or consortia of
companies. Courses vary in length from a few days to the month-long Advanced
Management Programme - which now runs four times a year, up from once a year
a decade ago.
The development of programmes for the former Soviet bloc is a high priority
on the short course side. Mr David Young, a finance professor, has pioneered
programmes for Polish managers, and is planning others - in conjunction with
IMD and LBS - to 'train trainers' from across the new democracies.
European Community funds permitting, that is - difficulties in the securing
of which prompt acid remarks about the problems faced by European
institutions without a strong national champion when confronting Brussels,
the supposedly 'European' citadel.
Insead has grown fast and big in the last decade - somewhat faster than it
can manage, mutter some potential customers. MBA numbers have grown at an
annual rate of 19 per cent for the last decade, yet the brakes have still to
be applied: plans are afoot to increase the intake from 450 to 600 a year,
with executive programmes (which subsidise the MBA) expected to grow at a
similar rate. Since 1989, a small but growing PhD programme has also been
running, a boon to Insead's research capacity.
A more interactive relationship with companies is the key to Insead's
future, says Mr Van der Heyden. 'Companies will require partnerships with
business schools of a new kind - a much more dynamic link.' He sees business
schools becoming more the consultant, less the teacher - on the medical
analogy, a shift from peddling cures to preventing disease in the first
place.
He cites Insead's link with Digital Equipment - which dates back to Insead's
foundation - as a model for things to come. It involves Insead faculty in
company study teams, and a steady stream of Digital managers passing through
Fontainebleau. The aim? To make management education less an act of faith
only indirectly connected with corporate objectives, and more a direct
linkage between business schools and corporate development.
'The trend is towards more - and more custom-designed - executive education:
in the long run degree programmes are dead,' says Mr Leon Selig, director of
executive education.
In the short run, however, the year-long MBA remains the brightest feather
in Insead's cap.
'I was expecting to find a country club atmosphere - Porsches in the drive,
that sort of thing', says one American participant. 'But nothing of the
kind. It's friendly - yet intense and relentless.' That is the general
impression. Competition is sharp, but group working smoothes the edges and
enthusiasm abounds. Other than comments on overstretched facilities, few
reservations are expressed.
'The best thing about the place is that it shuts at midnight - or else we'd
be here all night too,' volunteers a Canadian, with apparent frankness.
Simulations and problem-solving in small groups are the standard features -
interspersed with lectures and a hectic social round. The course is
unapologetically general: electives are offered only after four months of
core courses.
The MBA course has two entries a year - January and September. It is divided
into five two-month sections, with exams at the end of each. And it doesn't
come cheap: budget to spend FF230,000 (Pounds 23,800) for the year, advised
a survey of 1990 participants.
And after? According to Insead's career management service, typically
three-quarters of each intake want to start their own business. Barely 1 per
cent do so straight out of Insead, but within seven years more than
two-thirds are owner-managers. An impressive score - in any language.

FT  09 APR 92 / Survey of Management Education and Training (5): School that
is not in anyone's pocket - Profile, Ashridge Management College
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AT MANY British business schools it would have been an insult until recently
to suggest the institution was 'close to the market', or that the academics
had 'dirty hands' because they involved themselves closely with 'real world'
issues. Not so at Ashridge.
'We think it's great; we are in the business of getting our hands dirty,'
says Mr Peter Beddowes, Dean of Ashridge Management College. Indeed,
Ashridge has long prided itself on being both relevant and accessible to
business, rather than irrelevant and remote.
Mr Michael Osbaldeston, chief executive of the management development centre
and business school based at Berkhamsted, Hertfordshire, explains: 'We are
driven by learning objectives rather than education objectives.'
Accordingly, Ashridge has always tailored both its courses and other
activities to business requirements. It was among the first business schools
to recognise the need to become more customer-focused and to ensure that
executive programmes matched business needs, something many of its
competitors are now imitating.
'It is extremely important that we recognise there is a market we serve, and
also that we anticipate market requirements,' says Mr Osbaldeston.
Nevertheless, he accepts that it is important to maintain a balance, and to
avoid the danger of becoming simply a commercial training organisation. So
far, Ashridge appears to have succeeded in striking the right balance. It is
one of the most highly regarded business schools in the UK, particularly for
its teaching, and is also becoming well-known overseas.
In maintaining the balance between academic and market considerations,
Ashridge is fortunate in a number of ways. As an educational trust, set up
by an act of parliament, it is independent and does not have to answer to a
parental organisation like many business schools attached to universities.
And as Mr Osbaldeston proudly points out, it is also financially
independent. 'We are able to run ourselves as a business, and we can say no,
we are not in anyone's pocket,' he says.
Mr Osbaldeston talks about being in partnership with the companies which are
its primary clients. He sees partnerships as an alternative to the
traditional client/supplier relationship.
This concept of a partnership between Ashridge and its clients has other
important benefits. It helps bind the clients to Ashridge and enables it
actively to market the full range of its services while also providing much
of the raw material for research projects.
Both Mr Osbaldeston and his predecessor, Mr Philip Sadler who retired two
years ago, have followed a strategy at Ashridge of offering a steadily
broadening range of services, including consulting and research as well as
training, to the business school's clients, in response to market
requirements.
In the early years in the 1960s Ashridge mainly offered open courses for
managers which were marketed domestically and to the old Commonwealth
nations, particularly those in south-east Asia.
But in the 1970s Ashridge offered tailor-made management training programmes
for companies, courses 'set up by industry to serve industry and not by
academics,' says Mr Osbaldeston. By the late 1970s and early 1980s it had
grown to a position of dominance in this field and tailor-made training
programmes for companies now make up about 40 per cent of its total course
offerings.
Following a Europe-wide survey to identify specific and future management
development trends, Ashridge undertook a comprehensive overhaul of its short
courses which are now divided into seven multi-disciplinary themes to
reflect business realities rather than traditional subject categories.
'Managers wanted to be active participants in the courses rather than just
recipients,' says Mr Beddowes. At the same time, companies were demanding
more value for money from executive education.
Mr Beddowes says: 'Managers attending our redesigned open programmes will
find that within the broad structure, there is enough flexibility for them
to shape the programme to their particular learning needs.
'This approach enables them to benefit from the interaction with peers from
other companies, and at the same time pursue a path of learning that fulfils
their personal requirements.'
However in recognition that some clients require a qualification, Ashridge
introduced its own one-year Masters of Business Administration programme in
1987 - a qualification which is validated by City University and is aimed
squarely at providing those with management experience, and in particular
management 'high fliers', with accelerated leadership development.
The MBA programme is small - there will be 30 people on it next year - and
very expensive. For this reason, almost all the students are sponsored by
their employers. As part of the course, the students undertake a 'live'
strategic project on behalf of their employer or an adopted 'host company,'
again ensuring that the MBA course does not become remote or irrelevant.
Last year Ashridge published a survey of its MBA alumni entitled rather
extravagantly: 'Exploding the MBA Myth,' which showed that graduates of its
year-long MBA course, launched in 1988, were highly satisfied with their
qualification. Ashridge is currently considering whether to offer a
part-time MBA programme.
Since the early 1980s, Ashridge has also sought to present itself as an
organisation that offers more than just the standard open or tailored one or
four-week training course or MBA programme. Today Ashridge's activities
include:
Ashridge Management College. Established in 1959, this offers what Ashridge
is best known for, the short duration courses, both external and internal,
and the MBA programme. Altogether Ashridge runs more than 5,000 courses a
year.
Ashridge Consulting Group. Formed in 1985 in response to market pressure for
advice, ACG is a profit-making organisation with Pounds 1.75m income last
year.
Ashridge Strategic Management Centre is a London-based applied research and
consulting group established in 1987 and run by Mr Michael Goold and Mr
Andrew Campbell, formerly of the London Business School.
Ashridge Management Research Group. This used to be the research division of
the college and was hived-off two years ago as a separate entity. It
conducts research projects and surveys for companies, governmental bodies
and work commissioned by the management college.
The Independent Assessment and Research Centre. This London-based unit was
acquired three years ago and is a specialist in psychometric testing. It
offers courses for human resources managers and provides occupational
psychology consulting services.
The sixth and most recent addition to this 'portfolio' of services is the
Ashridge International Institute for Organisational Change (IOC) which is
being established in France. Ms Ariane Berthoin Antal became the institute's
first director at the start of this month.
Aside from emphasising Ashridge's commitment to internationalisation, the
IOC is seen by Mr Osbaldeston as a 'experimental centre' which will conduct
research into all human aspects of implementing change across national
boundaries. It will also hold workshops and conferences on change management
as well as providing consultancy services in this field to companies. If it
is successful, Mr Osbaldeston says it could become 'a model for how a
management centre of the future might operate.'
Through these units Mr Osbaldeston is attempting to position Ashridge as a
multi-disciplinary organisation able to meet the needs of companies for
management training, research and consultancy services. He believes the
future lies in a more integrated approach towards management and
organisational development.
One example of this approach is a post-course consultancy service that
Ashridge offers to help managers implement what they have learned.
Participants on the college's Leadership Development programme leave with a
confidential tape recording of their final assessment to which they can
later refer and, 12 months after completing the programme, they receive a
questionnaire to review their progress.
'We pride ourselves on our ability to meet market needs, and we redesign our
programmes to take account of the growing demand for courses which develop
understanding, skills and competences,' says Mr Beddowes.

FT  09 APR 92 / Survey of Management Education and Training (4): New culture
sweeps out bureaucracies - The Public Sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BUSINESS SCHOOLS conjure up visions of high-flying MBAs, aggressive
corporate executives and mega-buck courses and conferences. The idea of
nurses and teachers - let alone charity workers - rubbing shoulders with
managing directors seems quaint, almost absurd.
In many of the major management schools, it is quaint. A day in Insead and
the words 'public sector' go unheard; the nearest the London Business
School's executive programmes get to them is courses for ambassadors and
senior Home Office officials.
Increasingly, however, business schools are waking up to the public and
not-for-profit sectors, and vice versa. The growth in part-time and distance
learning MBAs has been in no small part geared to them (not excepting LBS),
and courses are following, too.
'Management' has ceased - just - to be a dirty word in the public sector.
With hardly a country in Europe and the Americas standing apart from the
trend, a new managerial culture is sweeping through state bureaucracies.
Devolved responsibility, profit centres, even autonomous trading funds, are
increasingly widespread; and as privatisation reduces the size of the state
machine, the cultural insularity of public sectors is progressively
weakening.
Britain has gone further than most in all those directions. Privatisation
has cut the state sector in half in a decade. In the remaining half, trusts,
contracts and fundholding are advancing in the health service, compulsory
tendering in local government, and devolved budgets and administration in
state schools and colleges. Not even Whitehall is immune: under the 'next
steps' programme more than half of all its civil servants now work in
semi-autonomous executive agencies and the proportion is set to rise to
three-quarters by mid-decade.
The management implications are dramatic: almost overnight the typical
secondary schools head or fundholding GP is finding himself a multi-million
pound manager, in most cases with nothing but 20 years at the blackboard or
in a hospital/practice as preparation. Management education in the public
sector is no longer limited to high-flying civil servants taking courses at
the civil service training college at Sunningdale (itself barely 20 years
old - and now an agency): it is spreading to every school and hospital in
the land.
Of the National Health Service alone Dr Christina Townsend of the NHS
Training Directorate says: 'We have a million employees, of whom 240,000 can
be designated as managers - after all, as soon as you become a ward sister
you take on significant management responsibilities.'
The directorate is pioneering a training strategy to give all managerial
staff a nationally recognised qualification through distance-learning
programmes. Courses have been developed with the Open University and the
Institute of Health Service Management.
'We were particularly keen to ensure proper back up and to see that case
material directly relates to the health service,' says Dr Townsend. 'If you
just produce training materials, they won't use them: a lot of our work has
to be done to ensure there are local tutors and mentors to give support.'
The courses were launched last year. The first-year take-up target was 1,000
managers: in the event 1,500 signed up, and the directorate is revising its
targets.
The Open Business School, which claims to be Europe's largest business
school with 25,000 course registrations this year, gears many of its
distance learning courses to the new market. The OBS's professional
certificate in management - the first of three levels leading up to an MBA -
runs a foundation course specifically for the voluntary and non-profit
sector. Leading clients include Barnardo's and the Red Cross.
'Nothing like it has been produced before in the UK or elsewhere,' claims Mr
Rob Paton, senior lecturer at OBS. 'It shares the successes of the voluntary
sector and its unsung heroes.'
Another option at certificate level is 'managing health services'. Aimed at
health service managers 'regardless of their profession or occupation', its
content is fairly general - 'managing yourself and your job', 'managing
people', 'managing in your organisation' and 'managing in the external
environment' are the principal modules. The course fee is Pounds 825, with a
reduced rate of Pounds 695 for health service employees.
The OBS has also launched a new MBA option on 'Managing Public Services',
aimed directly at managers in the civil service, NHS, local government and
the police. Organised into three blocks and a project, it tackles issues
including the differences between public and private sector management, the
working of internal markets, competition between agencies supplying public
services and innovations in resource management.
Some parts of Britain's public sector are more active on the management
education scene than others. Local government, with tightly constrained
resources, has tended to lag behind Whitehall and the NHS. Even there,
however, courses are developing fast.
Birmingham University's Institute of Local Government and Strathclyde's
Local Authorities Management Centre are leading the way. The Strathclyde
centre, established in 1987 with a grant from the Convention of Scottish
Local Authorities, is part of a university business school which already has
a strong public sector record (British Rail is a leading client). It offers
a range of in-service and post-professional courses for middle and senior
managers. Strathclyde regional council is the largest client, but
participants come from across the country.
Professor Alan Alexander, the centre's director, says: 'For middle - and
some senior - managers our courses provide a first exposure to general
management concepts. That's particularly important in local government,
where the emphasis is on technical disciplines and qualifications first, and
management second.' The courses have had a strong knock-on effect in
encouraging managers to take MBAs, and the centre is about to launch an MSc
in public management.
Research into public sector management is also gathering pace. London's
Imperial Business School and Cranfield Institute of Technology are just two
of many to have established public sector research groups.
The IBS has a health service management project, partly financed by
North-West Thames Regional Health Authority, exploring 'appropriate
structures and cultures' to support NHS trusts (in whatever form they
survive the election). Cranfield's emphasis is on 'practitioner
researchers'. According to Professor Leo Murray, Cranfield's director: 'We
are looking to them to see how management skills can best be improved in
what is, without doubt, a different environment from that we business
schools are used to working in.'
Teachers are further down the line. Even Mr Chips, though, may find a
business course as essential as teaching practice before long.

FT  09 APR 92 / Survey of Management Education and Training (2): Don't get
frightened - Technology Training
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DAYS when the highest technology to be found in a management training
room was a blackboard and chalk are long gone.
Today's managers are being taught with the latest electronics equipment,
ranging from interactive computer simulations to multimedia presentations
and language laboratories. And one of the things they are learning is not to
be intimidated by the technology.
But at the same time companies are demanding greater value for money from
management education and training schemes - one reason for the growth of
'distance learning' and training videos, and the launch in the UK next month
of the Executive Business Club, a subscription television service from
Management TV International.
EBC will comprise an hour of management training and business information
programmes each week broadcast in encrypted form over BBC Select - the new
pay-TV channel of the BBC. The idea is that member organisations will be
able to decode and tape the broadcasts, building up their own library of
training videos.
One recent study valued the total UK market for video-based training at more
than Pounds 22m and estimated that it would grow by between 20 and 25 per
cent this year. Such is the growth in the market that a few books have begun
appearing to help trainers use video more effectively, among them 'Using
Video in Training and Education' by Ashly Pinnington, a consultant to Henley
Management College.
Production and distribution companies such as Video Arts produce catalogues
containing dozens of films dealing with subjects as diverse as sexual
harassment, how to negotiate and telephone sales techniques.
Most of Video Arts' titles run for between 15 and 30 minutes and cost Pounds
100 or more to hire for two days, around Pounds 185 for a week or from about
Pounds 600 to buy outright. Many of them feature comedians such as
co-founder John Cleese, or Mel Smith and Griff Rhys Jones, and are based on
the premise that managers are more likely to absorb a message if it is
presented in a simple, concise and preferably humorous way.
Video Arts' latest catalogue includes such nuggets as 'Agreeing to Agree'
starring Mel Smith and Griff Rhys Jones on the art of negotiation, 'Cold
Call' on telephone selling, 'How to Lose Customers Without Really Trying)'
and 'Grime Goes Green' which explains the need for a corporate environmental
strategy.
In the UK other video producers include Melrose Film Productions and Longman
Training whose new catalogue includes over 150 titles dealing with issues
like Total Quality, sales techniques and health and safety for VDU users.
Some of the management colleges themselves have begun to produce training
videos. Sundridge Park Management Centre, a pioneer in the use of technology
in several areas, will design and produce what it calls 'trigger' videos for
use by corporate training departments.
Sundridge Park's training technologies department has also developed a
sophisticated interactive videodisc package called 'The Next Candidate' to
help train managers in interviewing techniques. Some of the video production
companies such as Longman Training have also begun to offer interactive
videos.
By combining the images from a laser disc with the power of a computer,
interactive video provides a powerful training tool. The interactive video
user can ask questions, receive information and work through a training
package at his own speed.
Among the discs available from Longman are several aimed specifically at
managers including one on delegation and another on appraisal and
counselling. Purchase prices range from Pounds 795 to Pounds 3,900 for
'Account Ability' which introduces the Price Waterhouse seven-step approach
to understanding and interpreting financial statements. Hardware to use the
interactive videos is available for hire.
Personal Computers (PCs) are also making their way into training colleges in
other guises, for example as gateways to other services. At Ashridge for
example, the Learning Resources Centre houses not only the library but also
a bank of PCs hooked up to electronic data bases.
Desktop PCs now have the power to run interactive training programmes and
the type of business simulation packages that not so long ago could only be
run on a mainframe.
Many management colleges now offer students a chance to play business games
or work simulation packages on classroom PCs. Ms Monica Seeley, an expert on
computer aided management training from Sundridge Park, points out that
computers can also provide computer-shy managers with the chance to learn
about computers and information technology itself. 'They provide hands-on
experience in a non-threatening environment,' she says.
Inter-active computer training programmes, once a rarity, are now available
from many sources and some are extremely specialised. For example, Strat*X,
an international strategic training consultancy, has developed a range of
computer simulations including Markops and Markstrat, which enable users to
apply and test marketing concepts and approaches in a realistic and highly
competitive market environment.
The firm recently launched a new simulation called Bidstrat which replicates
the behaviour of bidding markets such as aerospace, medical systems and
other high tech industries.
Other companies such as London-based RBRC software have produced team
business simulations which involve a team of four acting as a board of
directors and running a company for five years.
One of RBRC's seven programmes is called 'Beat the Boss' and forms an
introduction to business dynamics; another called 'Handling Time' is a
computerised exposition of the logic and mechanics of discounted cashflow
(DCF) and its application to business decisions.
Other software companies such as FSMD of Cheshire, set up by four former
graduates of Manchester Business School, specialise in designing, developing
and implementing educational programmes for individual companies, mainly in
the financial services sector.
Computers are also being used on their increasingly popular 'distance
learning' courses, the 1990s successors to the correspondence course. A
number of colleges including the Open University, Lancaster University and
Henley Management College use computer conferencing - achieved by hooking
home computers up to a college mainframe computer via a modem and telephone
lines. The big advantage of computer conferencing is that it allows
students, no matter how geographically dispersed, to communicate with each
other and the college as a group.
For example, Henley's Extended Learning Programme (Help) allows students to
connect with a central college database to retrieve details about the
course, workshops, examinations and administration. They can also exchange
electronic mail and take part in computer conferences and have access to the
college library and on-line databases.
The other area in which technology is being put to good use is for language
training, viewed as increasingly important on both sides of the Atlantic and
symptomatic of the pronounced trend towards internationalisation in
management education.
At the University of Bradford's Management Centre, which has one of the
largest MBA programmes in the UK, students have jumped at the chance to
learn languages in the centre's state-of-the-art language teaching system -
an interactive touch-screen system made by Sony and the first of its kind in
Europe.

FT  09 APR 92 / Survey of Management Education and Training (3): Value of a
degree / Take the measure of the MBA
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
AMERICANS AND Britons do it, Asians and even East Europeans now do it.
People around the world have been swept up in the glamour of the Masters of
Business Administration degree.
The MBA used to be seen as the automatic passport to a vastly enhanced
salary, a flashy sports car and an imminent seat on the board of a major
company. It is still widely perceived as a useful stepping-stone to better
things.
Even so, recently the degree has come under a cloud as an explosion in
supply has coincided with a growing disillusionment and the pressures of
recession. For some unfortunate students in Britain at least, the MBA has
become a staging post on the way to temporary unemployment.
British employers have historically had a lower regard for the qualification
than many of their counterparts overseas, particularly in the US. Even in
North America, the reputation of MBAs has suffered periodic tarnishes, with
the typical 28-year-old graduate stereotyped as being trained for no
position less worthy than the chief executive of a major corporation.
Attempts to change the curriculum have not always proved too effective.
Harvard Business School - one of the most famous of the American schools and
the originator of the 'case method' approach to teaching - was criticised
publicly last year by Mr Ian Evans, chairman of LEK, the management
consultancy. He said he would view applicants to his firm from the school
with great scepticism, arguing that the admissions policy there was now
'wayward'.
Last year, MBase, a computer-based employment service for job-hunting MBAs,
produced a widely-reported survey that suggested employers had little
interest in the degree. The findings stung the careers officers of many
business schools, already demoralised from one of the most difficult years
for recruitment they could recall.
But the Association of MBAs (Amba), based in London, pours scorn on these
negative images and stresses that interest is higher than ever. It estimates
that the number of British students graduating from UK institutions alone
with the coveted degree has risen from 775 in 1975 to an estimated 4,500 in
1991. At the same time, the number of organisations offering courses has
shot up from a handful to about 82.
Mr Peter Calladine, administrator at Amba, says: 'I think people recognise
the MBA as a portable qualification, which is very often a way out of a
corner, to prevent them becoming a specialist.'
Mr George Bain, dean of the London Business School, agrees that acceptance
of the MBA is growing, as demonstrated by both the rising number of students
and of employers willing to sponsor them.
Nevertheless, he concedes that 'some firms are reluctant to hire
freshly-minted MBAs'. He also says that the stereotype of the MBA of the
past is not entirely untrue, and the general consensus is that the number of
job offers to graduates has dropped by a quarter in the last two years.
'The environment is tougher now,' he says. 'There is no question that there
was a great boom in management education, which for the moment has ended.'
But he says new institutions have continued to enter the market for MBAs,
even though the peak has obviously been reached and the market is
overprovided for.
'The quality of faculty to staff up expansion like this is just not
available,' says Mr Bain. 'The market will sort itself out. Many weaker
suppliers will withdraw and the late entrants will probably suffer.'
That is hardly reassuring for students now contemplating studying for an
MBA. But the lesson is nonetheless clear. As Mr Bain puts it: 'You have to
be very thoughtful. Choose an institution with care.'
Mr Calladine adds: 'Despite what everyone says, there is no such thing as
the best school. It is no use someone in the national health service who
wants to stay there going to a school where most of the graduates go into
finance.'
He says prospective students should take every opportunity to talk to
faculty, current and former students, and even possible employers at
business schools to learn about the course offered and what it might lead
to.
The distinction between different types of MBAs is shown clearly in a
detailed analysis of the growth of enrolment in courses. Amba figures show
that full-time MBA students are now in a diminishing minority. The intake
last autumn was 3,500 on full-time courses.
The figure appears to have levelled off, which partly reflects the costs and
risks of the degree: on top of tuition of several thousand pounds a year,
students have to pay accommodation and other expenses. Most important,
nearly all give up their job, their salary and typically any commitment to
re-employment.
Perhaps surprisingly, a further 6,000 students were enrolled on part-time
courses, giving them the chance to continue working - and often be sponsored
by their employers.
However, both these figures now appear to be relatively stable. The real
area of growth is for MBAs obtained through distance-learning, such as the
courses offered by Henley, Warwick and the Open University.
Ms Sheila Cameron, MBA programme director at the Open University, and author
of a book on the qualification*, stresses that her course offers a great
deal of contact with other students through tutorials and residential
sessions as well as tapes and workbooks.
It also has the advantage - like all the other distance learning courses -
of being entirely flexible, with no requirement to attend courses at fixed
times, regardless of other pressures on an individual's time.
For those who choose a course with care - and are realistic about their
abilities and ambitions - the MBA can remain a rewarding and often
remunerative qualification.
Amba - 15 Duncan Terrace, London N1 8EZ - publishes a series of books,
offers student loans and holds a business school fair at the Institute of
Directors in London in October; the University of London Careers Service
holds one at the Business Design Centre, Islington, in the spring.

FT  09 APR 92 / Survey of Management Education and Training (1): Adapting in
hard times - Business schools must adapt to a changing and more
discriminating market in harder times.  Companies are seeking more
individual attention, and beneath the title 'MBA' lies an ever-wider variety
of courses. Serious management education is ceasing to be the preserve of
high-flying executives

BUSINESS SCHOOLS never had it so good as in the 1980s. Their MBAs became
prized commodities; their numbers and earnings soared; so did the salaries
of their faculties. And as the 'enterprise culture' swept Reagan's America
and Thatcher's Britain, their offspring vied with popes and prelates as
arbiters of official morality.
Now, it is hard times. Or harder times, at any rate, as recession bites,
'kinder, gentler' values rise uppermost, and schools come to terms with a
decade of frenzied expansion. For most, though, it is not a question of
decline, but of adaptation - to a new climate, and to a changed market in
which individuals and companies show them- selves more discriminating and
refuse to buy the old type off-the-peg courses and MBAs.
It is also a decade for change in the status of institutions, as the top
brass in host universities come to see their business schools as more than
simply milch cows to prop up under-funded humanities departments.
The US now produces 70,000 MBAs a year from more than 250 accredited
programmes; the number of institutions offering MBAs in Britain has almost
doubled in a decade - up from 47 to 82; and apart from Germany, whose
corporate culture and lengthy first degree programmes have so far kept the
business school at bay, the rest of Europe has experienced growth to match.
'There is a now a clear sense of weakening,' says Mr Roger McCormick of the
Association of MBAs. 'But in the past decade the growth rate has been so
strong that it would have been impossible to maintain it.'
The impact of the recession apart, across the sector six trends are clearly
marked.
First, executive courses - as opposed to degree programmes - are assuming a
progress- ively higher profile in manage- ment schools' budgets and out-
put. Typically, half an instit- ution's income now comes from courses -
programmes anything in length from a few days to a few months' mini-MBA.
The drift is also to more company-specific courses, and away from
off-the-shelf prog- rammes open to all comers. According to Mr Jean-Michel
Beeching, marketing director of the London Business School's executive
education programmes: 'Companies used to take whatever business schools had
to offer them. Now they are much more mature as customers: they are coming
to business schools and saying 'we want' rather than just looking in through
the shop window.'
European schools are well- attuned to the shift - recog- nising that
competition comes not only from other instit- utions, but from increasingly
professional in-house or contracted training teams employed by companies
themselves.
Variations on the theme of 'developing a long-term, inter-active
relationship with companies' reverberate around most schools - and are
becom- ing more than a slogan in some. British institutions such as
Ashridge, Templeton and Henley have long pioneered tailored courses, and
almost half of executive-course income at LBS, IMD (Switzerland) and Insead
(France) now comes from such programmes.
The position in the US is more mixed: some leading schools, notably Harvard
and Stanford, stick resolutely to open programmes, while others have become
active players in the 'tailored' market. Wharton (Philadelphia) reckons that
tailored courses will account for two-thirds of its income within a few
years.
The second trend is a response to 'the flattening of traditional corporate
struc- tures and hierarchies', in the words of Mr George Bain, prin- cipal
of the LBS. 'The demand is for a new generation of well-rounded, generalist
man- agers - not the dominance of the specialist of old.' Accord- ingly,
management education is increasingly seen as an ongoing, not once-for-all,
process. The concept of paid sabbatical leave has yet to catch on much
beyond acad- eme, but it is the logical goal.
'Internationalisation', a novel concern with management in the public and
not-for-profit centres, and the application of new technology - particularly
video and inter-active software packages - to management education are the
next three trends. They are assessed in articles later in this survey. Many
leading business schools will tell you only three truly international
schools exist: IMD, Insead and theirs. Most will also say they take the
public sector 'seriously' and are in the 'forefront' of applying new
technology. Look carefully beneath the blurb in all cases.
The sixth trend is a rapid growth in part-time and distance-learning
courses. The new-style part-time or distance-learning MBA is a management
development programme, geared particularly for those in mid-career - not a
magic turnstile to a career shift and a salary hike for thrusting executives
in their late 20s.
That trend is still working its way through. A survey last year by the
Council for National Academic Awards of Britain's 8,000 entrants to MBA
courses - who split fairly equally between full-time, part-time and distance
courses - found the typical MBA student to be male, 27 and middle-class,
doing the degree on his own initiative with only limited help from his
employer.
A few years hence, 'middle class' should be the sole survivor from that
composite. Britain's Open Business School, launched in 1983 and claiming now
to train more managers than any other in Europe, is a leading force for
change. It has just graduated its first 211 distance-learning MBAs - and has
another 4,000 in the system. MBAs are, however, only the icing on the OBS
cake: more of its effort is devoted to a certificate in management for
first-line managers and a diploma for middle managers.
'It may sound drastic, but there isn't much of a role for middle management
in tomorrow's world' is Mr Ludo Van der Heyden's view from Insead - through
whose portals middle managers generally pass only on their way up.
Professor Andrew Thomson of the OU takes a different view. Drawing a
'British management' pyramid with 0.35m senior managers at the top, 1.3m
junior managers at the bottom and 0.8m middle managers in between, he says:
'the high-flyers - the Oxbridge, Ivy League, Grande Ecole group - will make
it anyway: we need to be just as concerned with training those at the bottom
and in the middle, whose management careers are as likely to move sideways
as upwards.'
The fate of the British Management Charter Initiative - launched in 1988
after reports that each UK manager received just one day's formal training a
year - is instructive in that regard. In numerical terms, its record is
mixed. In Leeds only about 50 of the 10,000-odd eligible companies have
joined the MCI.
But its 'crediting compet- ence' programme for improv- ing management skills
has attracted more than 60 Leeds managers in the first five months since its
launch. Separ- ately, the Leeds Training and Enterprise Council included
Pounds 700,000 in this year's budget for training supervisory and first-line
managers - paying up to Pounds 1,000 per manager and Pounds 10,000 per
company.
Most of the funds are for approved courses developed with - and put on by -
Leeds business school, a part of Leeds polytechnic. Leeds Tec is confident
the funds will stimulate local businesses to efforts of their own - and not
just after the recession.
Leeds business school is rather less glamorous than its London counterpart
with the same acronym. For the most part its students do not populate the
great consulting and investment banking houses; nor do they generally
proceed to average salaries of Pounds 38,000 (Insead's 1990 average for MBA
graduates taking jobs in Britain). But management education has as much to
offer them as their high-flying counterparts - and it is waking up to the
challenge.

FT  09 APR 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei briefly breaches
17,000 in fresh drop

THE NIKKEI average dropped another 3.5 per cent yesterday, briefly breaching
the 17,000 level in the last hour of trading, as investors were unnerved by
Tuesday's weakness on Wall Street and the sharp decline in the Nikkei
futures on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The 225-issue average was finally 616.02 lower at 17,175.53, after opening
at the day's high of 17,742.67 and falling as low as 16,892.31 in the
afternoon. The index last closed below 17,000 on November 7, 1986.
Volume for the session picked up to 320m shares from 200m, boosted by buying
by a leading Japanese brokerage house and investment trusts after the Nikkei
fell through 17,000.
The Topix index of all first section stocks plunged 59.69 or 4.7 per cent,
the sharpest single day's fall for this year, to 1,219.88, the lowest finish
since April 1986. Declines predominated over rises by 955 to 49, with 39
issues unchanged. A total of 775 stocks registered new lows for the year. In
London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index shed 4.97 to 977.11.
While traders said the market fell in an 'orderly' manner, the lack of
buying interest increased pessimism. 'Nobody is talking about support levels
any more,' commented Miss Caroline Stone at Barclays de Zoete Wedd.
Continued weakness in banking shares dragged down other sectors. The Nikkei
500 banking index lost a further 8.8 per cent on concern about increasing
bad debt at the banks, especially real estate-related loans. The fall in
bank shares put pressure on companies to liquidate cross-holdings with banks
of lower strategic importance. Traders noted selling by middle-sized life
assurers, traditionally stable shareholders of banks.
Industrial Bank of Japan, seen as a benchmark for the banking sector, ended
Y190 weaker at Y1,330 on heavy selling. Fuji Bank, which expects heavy
losses due to its involvement with the fraudulent loan scheme scandal last
year, receded Y110 to Y1,160. Fuji is also the leading lender to Tobishima,
the contractor and real estate developer, which announced a restructuring
scheme last week.
Speculative issues also plunged. The sharp falls in the market have
depressed values of collateral for margin trading. Clarion, the most active
stock of the day, dropped Y100 to Y623 and Meiji Milk Products Y30 to Y700.
Industrial blue chips were sold. Nippon Steel slipped Y9 to Y291 and
Mitsubishi Heavy Industries fell Y50 to Y510.
Some electrical issues were bought by foreign investors. Pioneer Electronic
rose Y40 to Y3,800 and Sumitomo Electric remained unchanged at Y965.
However, leading electronics companies lost ground, Hitachi shedding Y17 to
Y771 and Sony Y10 to Y4,010.
In Osaka, the OSE average surrendered 864.86 to 18,545.34 in volume of 11.9m
shares.
Roundup
THE FALLS in Tokyo and on Wall Street undermined Pacific Rim markets.
AUSTRALIA regained some ground after falling to the day's low of 1,552.4,
but still recorded its lowest finish for seven months. The All Ordinaries
index ended a net 29.4 off at 1,554.3 in turnover of ADollars 203.1m,
against ADollars 258.5m.
Industrial shares were the hardest hit: BHP lost 28 cents to ADollars 13.24,
News Corp 52 cents to ADollars 17.30 and Foster's Brewing 10 cents to
ADollars 1.89. Banks were weaker, with Westpac slipping 12 cents to ADollars
3.59 and Commonwealth down 9 cents at ADollars 7.06.
NEW ZEALAND closed at a six-month low, with the NZSE-40 index down 10.03 at
1,380.80. Among blue chips, Brierley was 2 cents easier at 90 cents,
Fletcher Challenge off 2 cents at NZDollars 3.34 and Telecom a cent cheaper
at NZDollars 2.01.
HONG KONG retreated by 2 per cent to its lowest closing level since
February. The Hang Seng index lost 98.85 to 4,827.58 in turnover of
HKDollars 2.13bn, after HKDollars 1.77bn.
SINGAPORE recorded a six-month low, the Straits Times Industrial index
ending 21.36 weaker at 1,364.37 in volume of 42.9m shares, after 22.1m.
Foreign shares in Singapore Airlines slipped 50 cents to SDollars 17.70 on
speculation that it intends to cut fares to compete with other airlines.
KUALA LUMPUR pulled back from the day's nadir of 571.47 in late trading, the
composite index finishing down 12.85 at 573.61. Volume came to 28.3m shares.
Tanjong declined 60 cents to MDollars 11.20.
SEOUL slid to a new low for the year. The composite index ended 6.12 weaker
at 572.97 in turnover of Won247.5bn.
Sammi Steel reversed recent falls to close Won200 better at Won5,020. The
shares have been depressed by rumours that the company might merge with its
parent.
MANILA was pulled lower by profit-taking. The composite index dipped 3.38 to
1,135.99 in turnover of 221.7m pesos.
TAIWAN's political uncertainty depressed sentiment as the weighted index
lost 61.28 to 4,552.46. Turnover increased to TDollars 17bn from TDollars
12.27bn.
BANGKOK was driven lower by nervousness about the composition of the new
government. The SET index relinquished 3.48 to 828.91 in turnover of
Bt6.6bn.

FT  09 APR 92 / World Stock Markets: Selective buyers spell end of a blind
man's market - The stalling of the Mexican bolsa
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAMIAN FRASER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Mexican stock market, which rose an impressive 30 per cent in the first
two months of the year, has shown its first sign of jitters. In March it
inched up just 0.8 per cent, and so far this month the market has dropped by
7.2 per cent.
New issues cause much of the concern. In the past month Mexican companies
have raised just under Dollars 2bn in the domestic and international
markets, led by Grupo Financiero Bancomer for Dollars 837m, Cemex for
Dollars 608m, and ICA in an initial offering of about Dollars 400m which is
due to close this week.
Banacci, comprising Banamex, is expected to announce an offering for
hundreds of millions of dollars, while the government intends to sell a
further 5 per cent of Telmex for between Dollars 1.3bn and Dollars 1.5bn in
May or June.
The Cemex offering suggests that US investors might finally have had their
fill of Mexican paper, since it fell significantly short of the Dollars 700m
expected. European demand proved high, but US investors, already substantial
holders of Cemex, were less enthusiastic.
Stockbrokers are advising investors to choose their shares more carefully,
warning that this is no longer a blind man's market. In its monthly report,
Vector, the Mexican brokerage, says: 'The real possibility of adjustments to
the market underlines our strategy of selectivity.' Likewise Mr Roger Frank
of James Capel says: 'This year it is a stock picker's market,' and he
advises clients to restrict themselves to construction stocks, Telmex, the
telephone monopoly, and Cifra, the retail store.
Investors remain worried about the prospects for the North American Free
Trade Agreement, which is unlikely to become law in the US this year. If
negotiations break down, a signing next year becomes doubtful, and the
market could fall further, says Mr Scott Kalb of Smith Barney in New York.
Similarly, there is the ever-present risk of bad economic or political news
 -from Mexico or the US - upsetting Mexico's delicate political and
financial equilibrium. In particular, the credibility of Mexico's
quasi-fixed exchange rate - crucial to gains made in the bolsa - depends on
falling inflation and large capital inflows to finance the growing trade
deficit (Dollars 11.18bn in 1991).
So far the financial evidence has vindicated the government's economic
policy: economic growth slowed to 3.6 per cent at the end of last year,
reducing fears of overheating; foreign inflows of capital easily cover the
current account deficit; inflation, while much higher than the government's
over-optimistic forecasts, is falling; and interest rates are 5 percentage
points lower than in early January.
Best of all, corporate profits have beaten all expectations, keeping the
market's prospective price/earnings ratio around 12.6 in spite of the whole
market more than doubling in price last year. In 1991, average profits were
up about 50 per cent in real terms.
Mexico has thus remained popular with international investors, which
explains why its companies have been able to raise almost Dollars 2bn of
equity in one month. Total foreign investment equalled Dollars 24.8bn at the
end of March, according to figures from the Prime brokerage, up 32.4 per
cent from the end of December, and about one fifth of market capitalisation
(and a much higher proportion of the market float).
Investment in Mexican American Depositary Receipts (ADRs) increased from
Dollars 2.2bn at the beginning of 1991 to Dollars 17.9bn at the end of
February this year, reflecting the high demand for Mexican stock by
investors who are not allowed or find it too cumbersome to invest directly
in the Mexican bolsa. More than 20 Mexican companies now have stock traded
in the US.
The trend represents a de facto integration of Mexico's stock market with
Wall Street, so much so that Mexican share prices are often at the mercy of
foreign investors. When the government recently announced the sale this year
of another 5 per cent of Telmex, the Mexican stock market fell sharply as US
investors sold their ADRs.
In the long run this dependence on Wall Street may ease as new Mexican
pension funds provide domestic support. Until then, foreign investors will
provide much of the impetus, and when they feel nervous, the bolsa
inevitably falls.

with sale

   WELLINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE NEW ZEALAND government has sold its highly prospective Ngaere field on
onshore Taranaki for NZDollars 119m (Pounds 37m) to a consortium led by
Fletcher Challenge companies.
This decision four years of often bitter litigation about the ownership of
the field which ended at the Privy Council in London.
The potential of the field was noted on the eve of the sale of Petrocorp to
Fletcher Challenge in 1988, and Mr David Butcher, then Minister of Energy,
made a last minute decision not to include it.
In its recent decision, the Privy Council agreed with the government.
Petrocorp and its 80 per cent owned subsidiary Southern Petroleum are also
major shareholders in the adjoining fields, Waihapa, Tariki and Ahuroa. They
said that the purchase with neighbouring Waihapa would produce an estimated
20m barrels of oil and 100bn cubic feet of gas.
The agreement includes a clawback provision under which the government will
receive extra dividends if the field produces more than expected.
The government is not exposed to extra costs if the field produces less.
With the purchase Petrocorp's share of the field rises from 32 to 48 per
cent, at a cost of NZDollars 44m, and Southern's from 23 to 37 per cent,
costing NZDollars 43.6m.

FT  09 APR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Technical difficulties assail
Western Platinum
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WESTERN PLATINUM, the western world's third-largest producer of platinum
group metals, has suffered severe difficulties arising from its recent rapid
expansion as well as metallurgical problems at its refinery at Brakpan in
South Africa.
Mr Rob Davies, analyst at Shearson Lehman Brothers, part of the American
Express banking group, suggests the problems will not be resolved completely
for several months.
Consequently, the full benefits of the expansion - which aims to quadruple
base metal output and double that of precious metals - will take until 1993
to work through to shareholders in Lonrho, which owns 75 per cent of
WestPlats. At that time, the company expects annual output to be 714,000
troy ounces of platinum group metals.
Some of WestPlats' difficulties were caused by surface ore at the Karee
mine, where a new shaft is being sunk, and from the newly-developed Eastern
Platinum operations. That ore turned out to be heavily oxidised and it
disturbed the delicate metallurgy of the WestPlats process plant.
The plant was already suffering from 'lock-up'; a serious condition in which
the steady flow of material is disrupted and production no longer takes the
expected path. It is a constant danger for platinum plants, because the many
different metals found in the ore they treat take varying amounts of time to
pass through the system.
At WestPlats the ore goes to five mills. These produce concentrate, which is
treated at a smelter to produce a matte, an intermediate material. The matte
first goes to a base metal refinery where copper and nickel are extracted.
The residue passes to the precious metal refinery where gold and platinum
group metals are finally released.
It takes about a week for material to move through the smelter and then
about two weeks more for the base metal refinery to produce copper and
nickel. At the precious metal refinery, platinum is produced in about three
weeks, palladium and gold after seven weeks, and rhodium after six months.
Mr Davies says in a special report that, not only did the ore from Karee and
Eastern Platinum disturb WestPlats' metallurgy, but that most of the
sulphide minerals that contain the nickel with which rhodium is associated
had been naturally leached out. Rhodium was selling at Dollars 5,000 a troy
ounce at one stage last year (although it has since halved in price), so the
shortfall had a serious impact on Lonrho's revenue.
Mr Davies says: 'In addition to the technical problems, the whole operation
was having to contend with a massive expansion which caused costs everywhere
to rise as extra staff were trained and normal staffing ratios got out of
kilter.'
'Once throughput has settled down at a steady state, the plant ought to stop
retaining metal and, although it will always hold some, what goes in should
eventually come out.
'The problem of the oxidised ore disturbing the metallurgy should also
resolve itself as mining moves beyond the oxidised zones at Karee and
Eastern Platinum into fresh, unweathered ore. This will restore
metallurgical conditions to what passes for normal in a platinum plant.'
As for timing, Mr Davies points out that it took WestPlats' rival Rustenburg
and its technical partner Johnson Matthey of the UK ten months to get their
new South African platinum refinery working properly.

WOOL Prices are holding firm at this week's Australian sales, with some
small rises for better styles which are in relatively short supply at this
stage of the season, and following drought conditions in some areas. The
Australian Wool Corporation's market indicator was 582 cents a kg, on April
8, only 7 cents up from last week's close direction. The Easter recess
starts next week and firm markets ahead of the break will be welcome. In
wool using countries the knitwear side has benefitted most from lower wool
prices in the past year but other sectors remain adversely affected by
recession.

FT  09 APR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: SA gold mining strives to
retain its glister - A mood of grim determination pervading an industry in
distress
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE RELEASE of the March quarterly results of the South African gold mining
industry, which commences today, will reveal a picture of an industry under
considerable stress, fighting bravely to stay afloat.
Mr Gary Maude, managing director of the Gengold group, characterises the
mood as 'grim determination'. He adds: 'People are really determined to find
some way of preserving their livelihood.'
The source of the industry's problems is familiar: revenues have been flat,
while costs have escalated sharply. To be more precise, the average annual
Rand gold price during the period 1988-91 stayed within the very narrow
range of R992-R1,000 a troy ounce. During the same period, inflation
averaged 15 per cent. The crutches that the industry used to be able to rely
on - a buoyant gold price in times of uncertainty, or a weakening rand -
have both been removed.
Indeed, the prospect of the state assisting the industry by allowing the
rand to depreciate is very remote. Although gold is still very important as
a foreign exchange earner - 30 per cent of total exports, by value, in 1991
 -and as a source of employment, its influence is otherwise on the wane. Its
contribution to gross domestic product has slipped to less than eight per
cent, and it only contributed one per cent of state revenues in the 1991-92
fiscal year, compared with 9.6 per cent in 1982-83.
The state could help enormously by bringing down the inflation rate, the
industry's single greatest problem. Few economists believe, however, that
South Africa can expect much better than high single digit inflation in the
foreseeable future.
For all the industry's difficulties, it must be remembered that even at the
current weak gold price of R1,000 an ounce, or R32,000 a kilogram, only a
small portion of the industry is actually at risk, though all feel the
squeeze.
Chamber of Mines figures indicate that mines that are making a working loss
at the present price account for roughly 15 per cent of gold mine employment
and 12 per cent of total production.
Superficially, the industry appears to be in reasonable health. Total gold
production has been virtually constant for the past three years at 600
tonnes, productivity has risen significantly and hence profitability has
improved. Mr Nick Goodwin, analyst at stockbrokers EW Balderson points out
that, in the December 1991 quarter, the industry profit margin improved from
R185 to R233 an ounce.
A look behind the figures, however, is salutary. Improving productivity has
meant cutting production costs and lifting output. Both come with
considerable costs attached. Since labour represents about 52 per cent of
working costs on a mine, the axe has fallen hardest here. Lifting output
means pursuing the best grades available, or 'high-grading'. This has the
effect of shortening the life of a mine.
Improvements on the cost front have been impressive. Chamber of Mines
figures show that the working cost per kilogram of gold produced in 1991
rose by only 1 per cent during 1990, or one-tenth of the inflation rate.
On the labour front, a rough estimate is that job losses are running at
nearly 3,000 a month. In December last year, the number of people employed
on Chamber of Mines gold mines, which account for the vast majority of the
country's production, was 407,000; down from an average 473,000 employees in
1990 and a record 534,000 in 1986.
In terms of grade, the average grade of ore mined in the industry rose to
5.20 grams a tonne in 1991 from 5.05 grams in 1990. That reverses a
long-term downward trend, but the scope for improvement is limited and it is
very much a short-term measure.
A disturbing trend is the declining capital expenditure, which has negative
implications for production in five to eight years time.
Mr Goodwin notes that it is basically maintenance of production capital
expenditure that is being cut and this can be caught up, provided cuts do
not continue for too long.
He points out that new shafts, such as the Leeudoorn extension to Kloof, are
going ahead. That is also the reason why gold production is staying fairly
constant, despite marginal shafts being closed.
The unavoidable conclusion is that, while it is true to say that the
industry is leaner and fitter than it was a few years ago, this is not the
same as saying that it has improved life expectations. For all the
industry's efforts to address the symptoms of the problem, the problem
remains. Mr Maude notes that, despite all the achievements, 'I'm just closer
to the point where I have to think about closing mines than I was a year
ago'.
The great unknown, on the supply side, is exactly how long mines can
continue rationalising operations before being forced to close. Mr Goodwin
notes: 'Mines don't close, they just fade away' - a reference to the fact
that comapnies tend to close marginal shafts, even on rich mines, rather
than whole mines.
Mr Maude argues that, despite strenuous efforts, there is still more that
can be done to lengthen the life of his group's marginal mines. He says the
message emerging from the mines is that the increasing attention given to
'soft' social issues has diverted attention from basic mining issues where
improvements can be made. He says grade improvements on their mines bears
this out.
Many in the industry are hoping for a demand-led rescue to the industry's
problems, through increased jewellery offtake and changed sentiment, so that
the price improves.
Mr Mike Tagg, general manager at Gold Fields, notes that a price of R36,000
a kilogram would improve the industry's position considerably. The 10-15 per
cent rise in prices necessary to achieve this was 'nothing in terms of
commodity prices'.
He acknowledges that the old attitude that what was bad for the world was
good for gold and South Africa has been tempered by gold's failure to
respond positively to the Gulf War.
Demand for gold from the jewellery industry in 1992 exceeded newly-mined
supply in the western world for the third consecutive year and may even have
set a new record, according to preliminary estimates by the World Gold
Council, the producer-backed promotional organisation. Jewellery fabricators
may have used more than 2,000 tonnes for the first time.

ALUMINIUM prices on the London Metal Exchange reached fresh nine-month highs
yesterday before being pared back by profit-taking. The three months
delivery price reached Dollars 1,370 a tonne at one stage, but by the end of
after hours trading it was down to Dollars 1,355.50 a tonne, up Dollars 5 on
the day. Dealers said the early rise reflected a continuation of the recent
speculative activity, some of which they said was linked to options
business. And they thought that, once the technical reaction was absorbed,
an upside objective of Dollars 1,400 a tonne was a distinct possibility.
COPPER prices came under pressure after New York prices moved lower in early
trading. The cash price at the LME closed at Pounds 1,264.50 a tonne, down
Pounds 22.25 from Tuesday's close. At the London Futures and Options
Exchange coffee prices were marked down in the morning following a sharp
overnight sell-off in New York. The July robusta position dipped to Dollars
863 a tonne at one stage before profit-taking by holders of short positions
pared the fall. At the close it was quoted at Dollars 871 a tonne, down
Dollars 11 on the day.

DEUTSCHE Bank yesterday declared Heron International Finance in default on a
DM100m bond issue, AP-DJ reports from London.
Heron said the Deutsche Bank move was in line with action on Tuesday by
Credit Suisse to formally declare four SFr150m bonds issued by the company's
finance-raising arm in default. Both banks lead the respective bond issues.
The default declarations also follow Heron's technical default on March 27
when it notified creditors it was suspending debt payments pending a
restructuring of its Pounds 1.3bn in debts.
Heron, among Britain's largest private companies, is controlled by
foundations established by Mr Gerald Ronson, the UK entrepreneur. It has
asked creditor banks to extend payments over seven years while it moves to
sell off investment properties.
The company, which took heavy losses on US investments, has not disclosed
what portion of its debt it intends to restructure. However, it confirmed
that the restructuring includes the Pounds 450m in bonds it issued in Swiss
and French francs, D-Marks, and Ecus. Swiss Bank Corporation (Luxembourg) is
issuing up to 20,000 protected equity participation units on registered
shares in Sandoz, lead manager SBC Zurich said.

FT  09 APR 92 / International Capital Markets: Samsung bond marks the return
of Koreans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
KOREAN companies are expected to begin a return to the Euromarkets today
with the launch of a Dollars 150m convertible bond for Samsung Electronics.
It will be the first international equity-linked issue by a Korean company
since the country's stock market was opened to foreign investors at the
start of the year.
The ability of foreign investors to buy shares in the domestic market,
rather than through equity-linked euro-offerings, is expected to have an
impact on the yield investors demand on securities issued internationally.
'The terms of the convertible will have to provide an attractive alternative
to buying stock in the secondary market,' one banker close to the issue
said.
Samsung's 15-year issue is due to be followed by others from Korean
companies in the months ahead.
Chonju Paper, another part of the Samsung group, is expected in May to seek
between Dollars 20m - Dollars 25m from international investors through an
issue of Euro-depositary receipt arrangement.
These are similar to global depositary receipts, except that the securities
will not be traded in the US.
It is also believed that Hyundai Motor, another leading Korean company,
would seek to raise up to Dollars 150m this summer through an issue of
global depositary receipts.
Salomon Brothers International in London has lost the latest head of its
equity syndicate desk, the second such departure in recent weeks.
Mr Jeremy Palmer is believed to have taken up a similar position with JP
Morgan in London.
He has been replaced temporarily by Mr Alex Graham, who was brought in from
Salomon in New York this week to fill the gap.

FT  09 APR 92 / International Capital Markets: IADB agreement spurs prices
of Argentina's debt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRICES in Argentine debt have rallied following the country's agreement on
Tuesday for a debt reduction package with its international bank creditors.
The accord was struck at the annual meeting of the Inter-American
Development Bank in Santo Domingo.
Dealers also reported some profit-taking by investors who had taken
positions ahead of an agreement. The market had firmed steadily in recent
weeks, as expectations of an agreement mounted.
In the wake of the accord, Argentina's commercial bank debt rallied from 44
cents on the dollar to 45 cent, while its 11 per cent Eurobond issue due
1993 rallied from 102 to 104.
The agreement is set to reduce Argentina's funding costs and increase access
to the international capital markets for private sector companies. Argentina
returned to the international capital markets in September, when it launched
a Dollars 300m two-year Eurobond at a yield spread of 510 basis points above
the comparable US Treasury.
That deal has tightened dramatically to a spread of 290 basis points, the
last 25 basis points in the wake of the agreement. Argentine Eurobonds are
now almost as tight to US Treasuries as Venezuela's Eurobonds, which fell
back after the country's failed political coup earlier this year.
According to dealers, the flow of bond issues from Argentina is set to
increase, with deals for its two telephone companies, which recently
completed equity offerings, believed to be among the next batch of issues.
The conversion of Argentina's commercial debt into Brady bonds under the
agreement will 'attract more international interest, pushing yields down
further', according to Philip Harvey, a director of Morgan Grenfell.
In the next few weeks, dealers will start trading the Brady bonds on a
when-issued basis.
'People are still digesting the news. Some will decide to take profits, and
others will hold on for conversion into Brady bonds, hoping for further
gains,' said Mr Willem Naves, head of emerging markets at NMB Bank.

GLOBEX, the after-hours electronic trading system for futures and options,
is finally to be launched on June 25, it was announced in Tokyo yesterday.
The system, jointly developed by the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), the
Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) and Reuters Holdings, has been bedevilled by
delays and teething problems over the past two years. Tests at 250
keystations were completed on March 27, and the system is ready for launch,
Mr Leo Melamed, Globex chairman, said.
Mr Melamed said he had a meeting with Mr Tadao Chino, the vice-minister at
the Japanese Ministry of Finance, on Tuesday, who reconfirmed the ministry's
approval for the system to operate in Japan. He said the ministry had
previously given its blessing to Globex in 1990.
He said that he hoped Globex, which would open with 250 keystations in
Japan, would expand to 900 terminals within five years.
Mr William Brodsky, CME president, said the Globex centre in Chicago would
be expanded to operate as a help centre in every time zone.

shelve rationalisation plans

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CRA and North Broken Hill Peko, the Australian resource groups, have shelved
plans for one of the biggest rationalisations this decade in the country's
mining and smelting industry.
The two companies announced yesterday they were deferring plans to halve
their joint interests in the country's biggest smelting company, Pasminco,
to about 40 per cent.
CRA and NBH Peko announced in late February they were placing stakes of
almost 20 per cent each in Pasminco's capital on the market following a
ADollars 36.5m (USDollars 28m) slide into the red by the latter company for
the December half.
However, CRA and NHB Peko yesterday said they had resolved, after
considering a recommendation from their advisers, not to proceed with the
sale 'as the objectives of all parties could not be met'.
They indicated a divergence in NHB Peko's and CRA's attitude to the Pasminco
investment. 'North reaffirms its view that its strategic goals will best be
achieved by a reduction in its shareholding in Pasminco,' they said.
'North will continue to consider the manner in which a reduction may be
achieved.' This contrasted with CRA's view: 'As a diversified resource
company, CRA has maintained its long-term interest in the lead/zinc sector.
'This interest underlies its involvement in Pasminco and its commitment to
its future success. Currently, CRA is evaluating two major zinc discoveries
at Century and Dugald River in Queensland.
'It sees Pasminco's Australian smelters as having synergies with these
potential developments. CRA's investment position in Pasminco will be depend
on these longer-term considerations and on the structure of the other
shareholdings in Pasminco.'
The two companies said Ord Minnett Securities in Australia and Credit Suisse
First Boston in London would continue to advise on the Pasminco
shareholdings.
Delta Gold, the emerging Australian gold producer, has announced plans to
raise ADollars 41.9m with a 3-for-10 issue of shares at ADollars 1 each.
Funds raised will be used to develop the company's Kanowna Belle gold
deposit, near Kalgoorlie, one of Australia's richest recent gold finds.

Steel takeover

<TEXT>
THE New Zealand Commerce Commission, the monopolies watchdog, has cleared
Tasman Steel, Broken Hill Proprietary's subsidiary, to buy New Zealand
Steel, Reuter reports from Wellington.
BHP already owns 31 per cent and said it wanted to buy complete control.
Other shareholders have said they are willing sellers.
'The commission is satisfied that the acquisition will not result, or will
not be likely to result, in the acquisition or strengthening of a dominant
position in New Zealand steel markets,' said Ms Susan Lojkine, commission
chairman.
BHP still must get clearance from Australia's monopolies watchdog, the Trade
Practices Commission, to proceed with the purchase.
Fisher &amp; Paykel Industries and Steel &amp; Tube Holdings last week sold their
non-voting shares in NZ Steel to BHP for NZDollars 47.75m (USDollars 26.1m)
and NZDollars 26m respectively. Each owns 25 per cent of the voting shares
and said they would sell them to BHP once given approval.
Australia and New Zealand Banking (ANZ) said it was willing to sell its 19
per cent stake and had held preliminary talks with BHP, but had not received
an offer.
The New Zealand commission said that imports imposed an effective
competitive restraint on NZ Steel.
Fisher &amp; Paykel said NZ Steel had performed disappointingly since the
Helenus consortium bought into it for NZDollars 323m in 1989 and that it
would require fresh capital.
NZ Steel, backed by government-guaranteed loans, underwent expansion in the
late 1980s but the government had to bail it out to the tune of NZDollars
1.5bn in 1987. The government sold it to Equiticorp International for
NZDollars 327m. Equiticorp later collapsed and it was sold it to Helenus.
Ms Lojkine said the commission acknowledged concerns of Australian steel
suppliers. But it only had to assess proposals in terms of New Zealand
markets, she said.

THE Hongkong Electric Company (HEC) yesterday said it had arranged a
HKDollars 1bn (USDollars 129.4m) commercial paper programme with 23
financial institutions extending over 5 years.
The programme, arranged by Wardley Capital but which is not underwritten,
will enable HEC to raise either US or Hong Kong dollar-denominated
commercial paper for periods of one month to 12 months. It enables the
company to raise fixed-rate finance for periods of 12 months to 60 months in
either currency.
Mr Howard Welsh, HEC's finance director, said the facility would allow the
company to take advantage of competitive funding opportunities as they may
arise. 'We are delighted by the strong support demonstrated by the financial
community for the programme,' he said.
The 23 financial institutions would act as a tender panel although HEC was
allowed to accept unsolicited bids from any member of the panel, Mr Walsh
said.
HEC is owned by Hutchison Whampoa's listed subsidiary Cavendish
International. It operates Hong Kong island's electricity monopoly.

FT  09 APR 92 / International Capital Markets: Czech tobacco group draws
bids - Western companies are vying to buy Tabak
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ARIANE GENILLARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The future ownership of Tabak, the Czech tobacco company, is to be decided
shortly after the close tomorrow of a tender which has stirred the
controversy about the sale of former communist monopolies to western
companies.
Bidders - which include Philip Morris, RJR Reynolds, BAT Industries, Seita
and Rothmans International - have been asked to present offers to acquire an
initial 30 per cent of the company. This stake is expected to grow into a
majority ownership over time.
The investment will provide a strategic stronghold in the Czechoslovak
tobacco industry and in eastern Europe.
Tabak produces 20bn cigarettes annually and dominates the tobacco industry
in Czechoslovakia, which it shares with a smaller Slovak company.
The company's production volume also exceeds that of the Hungarian plants
which were recently sold to foreign companies.
Multinational tobacco companies have been running a cut-throat race to win
positions in the eastern European cigarette markets.
The rising demand for western brands in these countries provides scope for
greater growth than in western countries where sales are likely to decline.
The strategic value of the Czechoslovak tobacco company has been lifted by
the recent decision of the government to keep the company as a whole rather
than sell it in parts to competing buyers.
This move differs from Hungary, where Philip Morris has invested in the
largest tobacco company and will be competing with BAT, which recently
bought a plant producing 40 per cent of the 26bn cigarettes consumed
annually in the country.
In Poland, a government decision on the fate of the various tobacco plants,
which already operate independently, is needed before sales can proceed. The
Czech company, whose 1991 sales amounted to Kcs4bn (Dollars 133m), controls
an estimated 70 per cent of the tobacco market in the Czech republic. On the
national level, it is believed to control 60 per cent of the Czechoslovak
market, which it shares with the Slovak tobacco company, CSTP.
Tobacco companies have complained that the sale of Tabak will give a
quasi-monopoly situation to the final buyer and prevent competition among
plants.
They claim that selling separate plants would maximise the level of
investment in each plant, provide guarantees for employment levels and
foster overall growth.
The maintenance of a quasi-monopoly could lead to high prices and reduced
output, which in turn would affect tax revenues. Tobacco companies are still
taxed on a turnover basis in Czechoslovakia although a VAT tax is planned
for the near future.
Arguing against a break-up of Tabak, Czech officials have pointed out that
Tabak's position is not fully monopolistic because it shares the national
market with CSTP, the Slovak tobacco company and because imports of
cigarettes are liberalised. Legal cigarette imports accounted for 4 per cent
of the overall 31bn of cigarettes consumed in Czechoslovakia in 1990.
CSTP produces an average of 12bn cigarettes a year. It is also up for sale
with Austria Tabak believed to be a front runner. A clause in the purchasing
contract of Tabak stipulates that the two companies have to be sold to
separate international.
Government officials have argued that the five plants of Tabak are
inter-dependent and therefore cannot be easily separated. Filters and
packages, for example, are all produced in one plant.
Large companies in Czechoslovakia, which operated in monopolistic situation
in the communist era, have proved difficult to restructure before sale. This
has been achieved when production was differentiated, as is the case for
Skoda-Pilsen, the large engineering company where separate joint ventures
were created.
In many cases, the government, which wants to privatise as fast as possible,
has opted to sell whole companies.
The recent sale to Nestle and BSN of Cokoladovny, the Czech chocolate
manufacturer which operates 15 plants and holds 85 per cent of the market
for chocolate products in the Czech republic, was criticised locally as
preventing the development of smaller separate companies.
In general, the Czechoslovak authorities have preferred to ensure local
companies a significant western buyer rather than risk lowering interest by
offering smaller units.
In the case of Tabak, selling the company with its large market share will
maximise the investment, say Czech officials.
Western companies investing in eastern Europe have often been willing to pay
more for significant market shares than for assets, which often need
considerable upgrading.
To prevent the final buyer from concentrating operations at one Tabak plant,
Czech officials say that the purchasing contract will include a period of
time during which employment must be maintained and operations cannot be
closed down.
This provision, which has been common in joint venture agreements signed in
Czechoslovakia, could stretch over three to five years, officials say. Such
a provision would not prevent the buyer from significantly reducing
operations in some plants.
Winning control of Tabak would be an important prize for an international
group involved in the intense global battle for market shares. With this
advantage at stake the government is expecting a high price.

THE court-appointed administrators of Maxwell Communications Corporation
(MCC), the UK-based company once controlled by the late Mr Robert Maxwell,
have been granted a 60-day extension of their exclusive right to file a
reorganisation plan for the company.
The delay was granted on Tuesday night by Ms Tina Brozman, the New York
bankruptcy court judge who has overseen the running of MCC since last
December, when the company filed for protection from creditors under Chapter
11 of US bankruptcy law.
MCC is operating under a complex arrangement that permits the Macmillan
publishing company and Official Airline Guide, both MCC subsidiaries, to
function in the US and requires co-ordination between New York and UK court
administrators of the Maxwell empire.
Judge Brozman granted the extension, to June 15, saying the complexity and
time- consuming research required to ascertain the disposition of assets
warranted the ruling.
Time Warner, the US entertainment and media group, has agreed to buy
Maxwell's British publishing business, Macdonald and Co, for an undisclosed
price.

CANADIAN Airlines International's best chance for survival in an age of
mega-carriers is through alliance with American Airlines, says Mr Rhys
Eyton, the Canadian airline's chairman.
This could lead to American buying 25 per cent of Canadian, he said in
Montreal, but control of Canadian would remain firmly in Canada.
The deal would allow Canadian to cut costs by winning access to American's
more sophisticated computer systems, and both airlines will share staff in
foreign locations.
He dismissed a merger with Air Canada in any form. Merging the two airlines'
international routes while remaining separate domestically would be
unworkable for competitive reasons.
'Two carriers with 80 to 100 aircraft cannot stand up to the competition
from British Airways, Delta, American and United, each of which operate 500
or more,' he said.

FT  09 APR 92 / International Company News: Hafnia's 1991 accounts delayed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HILARY BARNES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BOARD of Hafnia Holding, the beleaguered Danish insurance group, failed
to approve the 1991 accounts after meeting all day yesterday. A brief
statement said that the board would complete its deliberations by April 10
at the latest.
Hafnia's shares were suspended on the Copenhagen and other stock exchanges
on Monday as speculation about the future of the group mounted.
After heavy and costly investments in Baltica, its Danish rival, and
Skandia, the Swedish insurer, the group is expected to report a substantial
loss for 1991.
Since its investment in Skandia in December, when the Danish company,
together with Norway's UNI Storebrand, tried to gain control of the Swedish
group, Hafnia has maintained almost complete silence on the progress of
talks with Skandia.
Monday's statement to the stock exchanges said the negotiations with Skandia
were reaching a conclusive phase, but this assertion was not supported in
comments from either Skandia or UNI.
Speculation in Copenhagen yesterday was that Hafnia's attempt to gain
control of Skandia might end in a complete reversal, with Skandia taking
over Hafnia.

red after price freeze

TELESP, the public telephone company serving Brazil's largest state, Sao
Paulo, suffered losses of Dollars 12.9m (Cr13.7bn) for 1991, compared with
profits of Dollars 107.3m the year before.
Telesp was among the most sought after companies in the Brazilian stock
market in 1991. Its ordinary stock increased in value by 12,419 per cent and
preferential stock by 11,046 per cent during the year.
One reason for Telesp's negative showing in 1991 was the price freeze
imposed by the federal government during most of the first semester, said Mr
Pedro Vilani, senior investment analyst for Norchem Bank, a Sao Paulo bank.
'After August, there were steep price increases, and by the end of the year,
prices had caught up with inflation,' Mr Vilani observed.
Another reason for Telesp's losses was the effect of a law requiring
companies to revalue assets to incorporate real inflation rates, which were
higher than original government figures.
'Law 8200 was a new factor from the point of view of investors,' noted Mr
Vilani.
The Norchem analyst expects Telesp to bounce back in 1992. In addition to
price increases, he noted that positive signs included the company's
expansion plan and its solid financial structure. 'We are expecting better
results in 1992,' he predicted.
Usiminas, the recently privatised steel producer, announced that it overcame
the effects of Law 8200 to make profits of Dollars 69m (Cr74bn).
The company said the inflation accounting changes required by 8200 cut
profits by more than half, forcing a downward adjustment of Dollars 82m.
Usiminas was the first company sold, in October, under President Fernando
Collor de Mello's privatisation programme. In 1990, it earned Dollars 11.3m.
The company is studying restructuring plans and hopes to buy into some of
the state-owned firms scheduled to go on the block, includ-ing Acesita,
Acominas and CST.

FLS INDUSTRIES, the Danish industrial conglomerate, improved net profits to
a record DKr660m (Dollars 104.8m) last year from DKr586m in 1990. The
group's interests include cement-making equipment, environmental
engineering, building materials and aircraft maintenance,
Profits before tax and extraordinary items were up from DKr670m to DKr690m,
which increased the return on equity from 20 to 19 per cent. Group sales
moved ahead from DKr11.35bn to DKr12.59bn.
After an extensive programme of acquisitions over the past few years, the
group said the share of sales abroad had increased from 49 per cent in 1989
to 75 per cent last year.
The board proposed an unchanged DKr12 dividend per share and a one-for-five
scrip issue, marking the group's 110th anniversary.
Employees will be offered 4.7m B shares, face value DKr100, at a price of
DKr105. The market price, after a DKr18 rise yesterday, is DKr634.
The board said the group expected to be able to maintain a satisfactory
result in 1992.
Although demand in main markets for their leading products was expected to
remain weak, several group companies had such a strong market position that
they were able to maintain earnings even in difficult times, the company
said.

POWER Financial, the financial services arm of Paul Desmarais' Power
Corporation of Canada group, reported that 1991 profit fell 14 per cent to
CDollars 159.7m (USDollars 134.2m), or CDollars 1.77 a share, from CDollars
184.6m, or CDollars 2.02 a share, in 1990.
The decline was due to lower income from short-term investments.
PFC's share of earnings of subsidiaries and in Canada and Europe, however,
rose slightly. PFC controls two of Canada's largest financial services,
Great-West Lifeco and Investors Group, and also a 25 per cent interest in
Pargesa Holding, of Geneva. The CDollars 41bn Caisse de Depot, the
investment arm of the Quebec Pension Plan, has invested CDollars 30m for a 2
per cent interest in the Paribas group holding company, Copeba.
Mr Pierre Scohier, president of Copeba, said in Montreal the two
organisations will co-operate in investing in Quebec, Canada and Europe. Mr
Jean-Claude Delorme, chairman of the Caisse, will join the board of Copeba.
Copeba owns interest in several Quebec-based companies. The Paribas group is
the second-largest stockholder in Power Corp of Canada, with two seats on
the board.
Dominion Textile, Canada's only surviving integrated textile producer, has
retained Goldman Sachs of New York, to look at all options for its yarn
business.
Domtex would consider selling it, merging it with another company or an
initial public offering.
The yarn business, with annual sales of USDollars 275m, represents about a
quarter of Domtex's total business in North America, Europe, North Africa
and Asia. It supplies commodity and specialised yarns for knitted and woven
apparel fabrics, for furnishings and industrial products.
It has seven plants in Canada and four in the US, with a total payroll of

</HEADLINE>

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
USF&amp;G, the large but troubled Baltimore-based insurer, yesterday told
analysts that it expected to beat current market expectations when it
reports figures for the first quarter of 1992, posting a very small profit
for the period.
Mr Norman Blake, the company's chairman, said that net income for the
quarter will be around Dollars 2m to Dollars 5m, and that this will
translate into a loss per share of around 9 to 12 cents after paying
preferred stock dividends. Analysts had been predicting a loss of some 30
cents a share.
In the previous year, the first-quarter figures showed a net loss of Dollars
55m, or 70 cents a share.
For the full year, the deficit amounted to Dollars 176m, having reached
Dollars 569m in 1990 - in part, a reflection of charges arising from a
restructuring of the business.
Mr Blake acknowledged yesterday that the insurance environment remains
'soft', but suggested that the improved figures stemmed for the realignment
of the business. USF&amp;G has taken steps to overhaul its business under Mr
Blake's command - pulling out of workers' compensation business in certain
states, for example, ceasing to write new personal lines insurance in
others, and slashing both head office staff and branch offices.
Analysts, however, have questioned whether - in the process of improving the
bottom-line results - the fairly drastic cutbacks would undermine USF&amp;G's
franchise.
Part of the insurer's problems stem from souring real estate investments,
and Mr Blake acknowledged yesterday that his predictions for the first
quarter allowed for some further strengthening of real estate reserves,
together with core insurance loss reserves.
Shares in USF&amp;G were unchanged at Dollars 9 yesterday, having been close to
Dollars 50 in the late-1980s.
Value Line ranks USF&amp;G as the 13th largest property-casualty insurer in
terms of premium volume, and around 60 per cent of its written premiums
relate to commercial coverage.
There has been talk of some improvement in personal lines pricing, although
few insurers think the cycle has turned, but commercial lines pricing has
been highly competitive and a further shake-out in capacity is thought
necessary.
Non-performing real estate loans will be a significant drag on Travelers
Corporation's earnings this year, said Mr Edward Budd, chairman, Bloomberg
reports.
After the insurance company's annual meeting, Mr Budd said he did not know
how much the company's troubled loan portfolio would affect profits this
year.
Describing 1991 as one of the toughest years in recent memory for the
company, he said profits last year would have been Dollars 300m higher if it
were not for underperforming real estate loans. The company earned Dollars
318m last year.
Underperforming loans in Travelers' Dollars 15bn real estate and mortgage
portfolio were Dollars 5bn at the end of the year.

NATIONSBANK said it expected its loan loss provision for all of 1992 to be
be in the range of Dollars 750m to Dollars 900m, AP-DJ reports from Atlanta.
Mr Kenneth Lewis, president of NationsBank, told an Atlanta business group
that the loan loss provision would be 'heavier in the first half of the year
and trending down in the later quarters'.
He added that the company expected that its loan loss provision and
charge-offs would decline materially in 1992, compared with the year ago,
but will 'remain abnormally high'.
Analysts project NationsBank will earn Dollars 4 to Dollars 4.10 per share
in 1992, up from Dollars 0.76 in 1991 when the North Carolina-based company
had huge extraordinary expenses from acquiring C&amp;S/Sovran as well as
enduring weakness in loan quality.
Mr Lewis said NationsBank had already reduced 3,000 job positions out of the
total 9,000 it plans to eliminate over the next two years.
He said NationsBank is negotiating to sell two portfolios of real estate
with a combined total of Dollars 850m, and that the company should know
'this quarter' whether those deals will happen.
Mr Lewis declined to give an outlook for the first quarter, but indicated
that there would be 'further significant (securities) gains' in the quarter
as the company continues to restructure the average maturity of its
portfolio downward.
The company expected a decline in non-performing asset levels in 1992, but
the economy and asset-disposition efforts would determine the degree of the
decline.

DOW JONES, publisher of the Wall Street Journal, yesterday reported a 58 per
cent rise in first-quarter net income as advertising lineage at the
newspaper rebounded from the depressed level of 1991.
Dow Jones reported income of Dollars 28.39m, or 28 cents a share, compared
with Dollars 17.96m, or 18 cents, in the first quarter of last year.
Revenues rose nearly 5 per cent to Dollars 436m. The profit figures were
towards the top end of Wall Street expectations.
The Wall Street Journal has been helped over the past two quarters by
advertising for the flood of new securities issues in the US market.
Corporate advertising, hit hard by the recession, still appears to be
relatively soft, say brokers' analysts.
The company itself attributed its improved performance to higher advertising
lineage at the Journal, lower interest expense and improved earnings at
Telerate, its electronic financial information service, and at its Ottaway
community newspapers.
Operating income at its business publishing segment rose from Dollars 9.68m
to Dollars 24.62m on revenues 8 per cent higher at Dollars 186m. Advertising
lineage at the Journal rose 9.2 per cent relative to the first quarter of
last year.
There was one additional publishing day this year, and on a per-issue basis
lineage rose 7.5 per cent.
The company's information services segment - which includes Telerate -
produced operating income of Dollars 40.26m, compared with Dollars 38.52m,
on revenues 2.2 per cent higher at Dollars 196.25m.
Ottaway Newspapers saw a rise in profits from Dollars 2.7m to Dollars 4.14m,
while revenues rose 2.6 per cent to Dollars 53.23m.
However, advertising lineage at its daily newspapers fell 5.5 per cent.

COMPAGNIE Generale d'Industrie et de Participations (CGIP), the French
holding group controlled by the Wendel steel family, yesterday reported a
slight decline in net annual earnings.
The group, a big shareholder in both CMB Packaging, the Franco-British
packaging group and in Cap Gemini Sogeti, Europe's leading provider of
computer services, saw provisional net income decline to FFr664mm (Dollars
118.57m) last year from FFr698m in 1990.
This was 'a stable performance in a difficult economic environment', said Mr
Ernest-Antoine Seilliere, CGIP's chairman.
It reflected an improvement from CMB Packaging, soon to be renamed Carnaud
Metal Box after the companies described by its initials, a downturn at Cap
Gemini Sogeti, and the absence of a large exceptional gain made from an
asset sale in 1990, he said.
New management had moved into place smoothly at CMB, after last year's
change of chairman, and co-operation with the British shareholders was good,
said Mr Seilliere. CGIP was 'a faithful shareholder' in CMB and expected
fresh progress from the group, he said.

ALCATEL Alsthom, the French telecommunications and engineering giant,
yesterday reported a higher-than-expected 20 per cent rise in net annual
profits and forecast a further improvement in the current year.
Mr Pierre Suard, group chairman, said net profits had risen to FFr6.2bn
(Dollars 1.1bn) last year from FFr5.1bn in 1990, thanks to increased sales
and earnings across the main divisions - communications systems, energy and
transport, electrical engineering, and batteries. The net gain came after a
FFr2.7bn restructuring charge. This was an excellent performance in
difficult economic conditions and compared well with competitors, said Mr
Suard.
Group sales rose by 11 per cent to FFr160bn. The underlying increase was 7
per cent, after stripping out the first contribution from acquisitions made
during one of Alcatel's busiest years for takeovers.
The main acquisitions have been centred on North America, Germany and Italy.
They include the transmission equipment division of Rockwell of the US;
Telettra, the Italian maker of transmission equipment; Canada Wire, the
cable producer; and AEG Kabel in Germany.
As a result of the growth in investments, net debts rose from 7 per cent of
shareholders' funds to 16 per cent over the same period.
Over the past five years, the proportion of Alcatel's sales outside France
had risen from 30 per cent to 70 per cent, Mr Suard said. 'We consider the
European market to be our domestic market, and furthermore, a buoyant market
which will remain so.'
The communications systems division, where Alcatel is Europe's largest
supplier of telecommunications equipment, saw an 18 per cent rise sales to
FFr109.8bn, representing just over two thirds of the group total. Divisional
operating profits rose by 23 per cent to FFr11.8bn.
GEC Alsthom, the energy and transport equipment group jointly owned with GEC
of Britain, contributed FFr25.9bn to the group's sales, a 16 per cent rise
on the previous year.

THE Berliner Handels-und Frankfurter Bank (BHF) yesterday rounded off a
robust reporting season for Germany's banking sector. The Frankfurt-based
merchant banking group announced partial operating profits up by 15.5 per
cent to DM283m (Dollars 174.7m) and full operating profits - which include
the bank's own account trading results - up 18.5 per cent to DM342m.
As with its competitors, which have reported record profits in recent days,
BHF enjoyed the benefits of a mixture of strong loan demand, good overseas
lending business and improved stock market conditions.
Growth was more pronounced for the parent bank, which had greater exposure
to the buoyant domestic banking market. Partial operating profits rose 30
per cent to DM244m and full operating profits rose by 32 per cent to DM303m.
Mr Klaus Subjetzki, the bank's senior partner, said that the parent bank's
profits for the first three months of the year were 'clearly ahead' of the
same period last year. However he said it was too early to predict whether
this performance could be sustained for the entire year.
As previously announced, the 1991 dividend will be increased by DM1 to DM13
an ordinary share.
Interest income rose by 20.4 per cent to DM436m last year at the parent
bank, and the interest rate margin rose from 1.58 per cent to 1.72 per cent.
Commission income rose by 5.3 per cent, reflecting variable conditions in
different areas of commission-earning business.

FT  09 APR 92 / International Company News: The price of saying 'oui' too
often - The impact of Credit Lyonnais' lending miscalculations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The opulent head office of Credit Lyonnais on Boulevard Haussmann in the
heart of the Paris banking district is plastered with posters proclaiming
its slogan - 'Le pouvoir de dire oui' ('The power to say yes').
However, when Mr Jean-Yves Haberer, Credit Lyonnais' chairman, casts his eye
along the list of his bank's debtors, he must wish that it had not said
'oui' quite so often. This afternoon he will reveal annual results which
will show how much it cost Credit Lyonnais to say yes to Mr Robert Maxwell -
the disgraced British media baron - Mr Giancarlo Parretti - the Italian
businessman who hauled the bank into an embarrassing and expensive legal
fight over MGM, the Hollywood movie studio - and Mr Jean Luc Lagardere -
whose media empire, Hachette, has been hit by the collapse of La Cinq, the
French TV station.
Analysts are bracing themselves for a fall in net profits from last year's
FFr3.7bn (Dollars 672.7m) and for hefty provisions, which, as one put it,
'could be anything from FFr7bn to FFr10bn'.
The agony will not end there. Even if Credit Lyonnais makes the fullest
possible provisions for 1991, it almost certainly faces another painful
write-down for 1992 because of its exposure to the precarious property
sector, particularly to Olympia &amp; York, the ailing Canadian company
currently trying to reschedule its Dollars 20bn debt. Credit Lyonnais is
believed to be O&amp;Y's second biggest European creditor, after Barclays.
On the surface Credit Lyonnais seems to be paying a painful price for the
aggressive lending policy pursued by Mr Haberer in the late 1980s. This
formed part of his attempts to turn the sleepy, state-controlled French bank
into a 'universal bank' along the lines of the mighty Deutsche Bank, with
broad interests across the banking sector, extensive industrial investments
and one of Europe's biggest retail banking networks, with a significant
presence in Belgium, Spain and Italy as well as France.
The cynics in the French financial establishment, who had fumed as Mr
Haberer swept through the ranks of the Treasury and then to the top of the
prestigious Paribas investment banking group, were quick to condemn his
plans. Over the past year or so they have barely bothered to disguise their
glee as Credit Lyonnais' loans have gone sour.
But Credit Lyonnais' predicament may not be quite as bad as they believe.
Some aspects of Mr Haberer's strategy have undoubtedly flopped, notably the
loans policy. Many big banks lent money to the stricken giants of the 1980s,
but few banks lent quite so much money to so many losers as Credit Lyonnais.
Credit Lyonnais has tried to limit the damage. It secured some of its loans
to Mr Maxwell and has managed to securitise part of its Soviet debt. It has
also won its legal battle against Mr Parretti, if only to be left with the
stricken MGM. Moody's, the credit ratings agency, last autumn lowered the
rating on Dollars 6.9bn of its long term debt.
That said, the real impact of Credit Lyonnais' bad debts is not as
disastrous as it first appears. Mr Sasha Serafimovski, banking analyst at
Morgan Stanley in London, reckoned that if it made provisions of FFr8bn for
1991, the charge as a proportion of total loans would be 1.3 per cent.
This would be much lower than such proportions at the big banks in the UK,
with an average of 2 per cent, and in the US, where the worst cases have
reached 3 per cent.
Moreover, Mr Haberer's strategy has succeeded in some areas. He has been
criticised in France for his ambitious international expansion, but most of
the investments, notably the Italian and Spanish retail networks, are
thought to be performing well as is the core French network.
'Credit Lyonnais has invested heavily in tighter management and cost control
which seems to be paying off,' said Mr Chris Davis, European banking analyst
at Barclays de Zoete Wedd in London.
The progress in retail banking augurs well for the future. Credit Lyonnais
is trying to expand in Germany where it is in negotiations over an
investment in BfG Bank. Last year it also fared well in other financial
activities - the Altus banking subsidiary in France and its huge junk bond
portfolio in the US.
But Altus is a volatile business, as illustrated by its swing from hefty
losses (from foreign exchange dealings) in the first half of 1991 into an
impressive profit for the full year, as are junk bonds. 'These are high risk
businesses,' said Mr Serafimovski. 'Credit Lyonnais could make a killing one
year, but nothing the next. And what is a French bank doing with one of the
biggest junk bond portfolios in the US?'
But most analysts seem prepared to accept that, however ghastly today's
results may be, it is still too soon to assess whether, in the long term, Mr
Haberer's strategy will succeed. 'Credit Lyonnais certainly has its
problems, but this is a very big business. It will be three or four years
before we can make a sensible assessment,' said Mr Davis.

FT  09 APR 92 / International Company News: NTT cuts profits forecast as
competition heats up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NTT, the telecommunications group which is the world's largest company in
terms of capitalisation and Japan's largest employer, expects profits to
fall sharply in the face of increased competition from newly licensed
telecommunications carriers.
Mr Masashi Kojima, NTT president, said that the group's profits for the year
to the end of March 1993 were expected to fall to below Y300bn (Dollars
2.25bn), down from the Y351bn it had forecast for the period as recently as
February.
In the year to end-March, NTT expects profits within a range of Y300bn and
Y375bn.
NTT has faced mounting competition from rival telecommunications groups
since it was privatised and the Japanese telecoms market was deregulated in
1985.
The new telecoms groups, known as common carriers, have steadily increased
their share of the domestic Japanese market by offering significantly lower
call rates. On some heavily used routes, such as between Tokyo and Osaka,
the new carriers are estimated to have taken about 50 per cent of the
traffic.
The expected deterioration in NTT's profits in the coming year stems from
falling revenues due to lower prices and its loss of market share. NTT was
forced recently to announce a further rate cut following cuts by its
competitors.
NTT will cut rates for calls over 160km by 17 per cent in June following
plans by the three common carriers to introduce a 10 per cent cut in rates
for calls over 170km.
Unless NTT follows their lead in reducing costs, it can expect to see a
further wave of customers switching over to competitors. The slowdown of the
Japanese economy has already led more business users to opt for the services
of the common carriers.
At the same time, although NTT faces pressure on revenues, it is practically
impossible for it to counter the situation with drastic cost-cutting
measures.
NTT still carries the legacy of its public utility days, and capital
investment decisions are largely dictated by public investment requirements.
With the Japanese government expected to increase the level of public
spending to boost the economy, analysts are forecasting a rise in NTT's
capital investment to Y1,960bn in the coming fiscal year from Y1,890bn in
the year to March.

sales

<TEXT>
SIP, Italy's state-owned telephone operating utility, raised net group
profits by 21 per cent to L486.4bn (Dollars 397m), due partly to a 16.7 per
cent increase in sales to L19,453bn.
The improvement has prompted a L5 rise in the dividend to L75 a share for
ordinary shares and L95 for savings stock. SIP's higher profits, which had
been largely expected, came in spite of the slowdown in the Italian economy,
with traffic volumes rising by only 8.8 per cent.
The company has been investing heavily to improve the quality of services
and install more efficient equipment to raise productivity. SIP said
industrial costs had grown by 11.7 per cent in 1991, while operating profits
surged by 17.4 per cent to L2,747bn.
The group gave no indication of how much profits had been swollen by its
monopoly over Italy's lucrative portable telephones service, which ranks
second to the UK with 568,000 subscribers. Executives from SIP, which has an
exclusive contract to operate telephone services until early next century,
have been fighting government plans to open the market for portable phones
to a second operator.
Investments rose by 10.7 per cent to L10,751bn. The company has reached
agreement with the government on a price cap system linking tariff increases
to pre-set quality and productivity criteria. It said it had increased the
number of digital exchanges while the time taken to install a phone had been
cut by almost half to 17 days.
Europa Metalli, the industrial arm of the SMI non-ferrous metals group,
raised consolidated turnover to L3,013bn last year from L1,485bn in 1990
following the inclusion of sales for Kabelmetal, the German metals group
bought in late 1990. Group net profits rose to L10.9bn after minority
interests, against L8.9bn the previous year. As in 1990, the group is not
proposing to pay a dividend.

<TEXT>
PHILIPS, the Dutch electronics group, yesterday exercised a Dollars 66m
option to acquire shares in Blockbuster, the US-based video rental chain
which owns the Cityvision chain in the UK.
The move raises the Dutch company's stake in Blockbuster to 4.5 per cent and
deepens a partnership formed last November. The 6m shares bought yesterday
come on top of 2m shares purchased at the end of February.
Blockbuster also said that it had amended an additional option which allows
Philips to buy 5m more shares. The option is now exercisable until December
15 this year, but if the shares are bought between July 1 and the end of the
year, the price will rise to Dollars 12 per share. If it is exercised before
July 1, the price will be Dollars 11 - the price at which the 6m shares were
bought under the first option.
When Philips agreed to invest the Dollars 66m in Blockbuster last year, it
said that this would either take the form of a direct stake - exercise of
the 6m share option - or that the money would be put into joint projects in
the home entertainment field, possibly a stake in Cityvision.

FT  09 APR 92 / UK Company News: No date set for GPG return
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIGEL CLARK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DATE of GPG's return from suspension is still not known. When questioned
at yesterday's annual meeting. Sir Ron Brierley, chairman of the investment
vehicle, said that the company was still in discussions with the Stock
Exchange.
An announcement would be made when appropriate. He added that he hoped it
would not be too long as the circumstances in which the company had been
suspended no longer applied.
Sir Ron refused to appoint non-executive directors and faced strong
questioning about the choice of preparing the accounts under the Financial
Reporting Exposure Draft 1, which has not yet been adopted.
The call for non-executives was made in connection with a share option
scheme for directors and management. Sir Ron said he was a non-executive
director and also thought that the existing management should be able to
take responsibility for the scheme, under which he would benefit.
The choice of the new draft was made, according to Sir Ron, because it was
topical when the accounts were produced and he thought it would be adopted
in the near future. He added: 'I feel that it is a very good and simple
concept which provides a realistic picture of the company.'
Under the new draft earnings per share came out 3.38p, whereas the present
rules earnings would have been 1.58p.
GPG's shares have been suspended at 23p in London since December 1990 when
it was considered to be a shell.
GPG is making a hostile bid with Brierley Investments, in which Sir Ron has
a 2 per cent holding, for Australian Consolidated Investments, the former
Bell Resources.

FT  09 APR 92 / UK Company News: Frederick Cooper shows 14% decline to
Pounds 1.96m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PROFITS OF Frederick Cooper, the West Midlands-based architectural hardware,
specialist coatings and electrical products group, fell by 14 per cent from
Pounds 2.29m to Pounds 1.96m pre-tax for the six months to January 31.
However, the interim dividend is maintained at 1.5p from lower fully diluted
earnings of 2.8p per share against 3.2p.
Mr Eddie Kirk, chairman, said trading conditions during the second half had
weakened . . . 'and, as yet, there are no signs of recovery in our markets.'
Turnover was relatively static at Pounds 41.4m but profits were bolstered by
an exceptional credit of Pounds 312,000, representing the net contribution
of a pension surplus of Pounds 400,000 and proceeds from a property disposal
offset by rationalisation costs.
During the period, specialist coatings sold at record levels - largely
because of the German market.
However, architectural hardware sales, held back by the weakness of the UK
construction industry, slipped by 7 per cent and the electrical products
division fell into loss.
So far in the second six months the electrical products division has moved
back to profit, but February and March were poor for architectural hardware,
which now accounts for 60 per cent of group turnover.

George Weston Foods, the Sydney-based food company controlled by Associated

Jacques in Sydney.
Net profits were steady at ADollars 49.3m (Pounds 21.5m) on a small sales
gain to ADollars 939.6m. The annual dividend is held at 14 cents with a
same-again 9.5 cents final.
Poor market conditions prevented the company from reaping the rewards of
cost cutting during the year. The Queensland bread operations suffered
significant losses and overall bakeries results were hit by higher wheat
prices and a consumer move to downmarket brands.
Trading margins had not improved so far in the current year.

<TEXT>
INDEPENDENT Newspapers, the Irish newspaper and publishing group, yesterday
reported a 20 per cent drop in pre-tax profits, from IPounds 9.99m to
IPounds 7.97m (Pounds 7.45m), for the year to December 27.
Turnover of the group's worldwide operations was marginally up at IPounds
155.8m (IPounds 154.9m). Exceptional costs amounting to IPounds 3.37m
related to redundancies and the unsuccessful bid for Australia's John
Fairfax newspaper group accentuated the profits fall from the company's
overseas markets.
However, Mr Liam Healy, group chief executive, said that growth in
advertising and circulation revenues in the home market helped the domestic
operations increase profitability. Turnover in Ireland totalled IPounds
120m, giving operating profits of IPounds 13.5m. The overseas arms made
IPounds 2.6m on turnover of IPounds 35m.
Net interest charges were halved to IPounds 2.53m (IPounds 5.11m) after debt
was reduced to IPounds 8.8m (IPounds 47.6m) at the year-end. The cut in debt
was largely due to the raising last April of IPounds 30m in a convertible
capital bond and the repayment of an ADollars 20m loan, relating to the
investment in Australian Provincial Newspapers.
Earnings per share declined to 18.8p (23.77p). A final dividend of 9p (8.5p)
is recommended, for a total of 14p (13p).
Following the failure of its Fairfax bid, Independent is now interested in
taking a stake in Mirror Group Newspapers. 'If shares were put up for sale
by the administrator, we would take a look,' said Mr Healy.

FT  09 APR 92 / UK Company News: Martin Currie to take over PHIT
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Personal Finance Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MARTIN CURRIE Pacific has agreed to take over fellow investment trust
Pacific Horizon in an all-share deal.
The takeover comes one month after a merger between CST Emerging Asia Trust
and Pacific Horizon broke down. CST's board then said that 'the value
realisable by CST's shareholders as a result of the proposals was uncertain'
and that 'PHIT's portfolio and performance, in terms of the decline in net
assets per share since launch, provided no grounds for selecting PHIT as a
merger partner.'
However, Mr Michael Kennedy, of Martin Currie, said the takeover took
account of the uncertain element of Pacific Horizon's portfolio.
About 11 per cent of the portfolio, consisting of investments in illiquid
closed end funds, was being excluded from the terms of the offer. These
holdings will be sold separately and the proceeds distributed to Pacific
Horizon shareholders.
Martin Currie Pacific will offer shares at 92 per cent of the formula asset
value (FAV) of the rest of Pacific Horizon's portfolio; this offer will be
increased to 93 per cent of FAV if warrant holders approve the deal.
Some 53 per cent of Pacific Horizon shareholders have agreed to accept the
offer, which is recommended by the PHIT board.
Pacific Horizon, which is managed by Jupiter Tyndall, was launched in 1989
out of the ashes of the Australia Investment Trust.
Shares in the trust were initially offered at 50p; they closed yesterday at
25p, up 2p on the day.

FT  09 APR 92 / UK Company News: Cairn Pounds 28m deficit after write-downs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Cairn Energy, the oil and gas explorer, surprised the City with pre-tax
losses of Pounds 27.6m for 1991 after a substantial exceptional write-down
which almost halved the value of balance sheet assets. The losses compared
with Pounds 334,000 in 1990.
Mr Bill Gammell, chief executive, said the decision to make a Pounds 24.5m
write-down reflected a 'greater degree of realism' across the oil industry.
The write-down partly covers gas-producing assets in the US and some of the
company's stakes in North Sea oilfields.
The company would have made a profit of Pounds 1.2m last year if it had
continued with its previous policy on depletion charges, but Mr Gammell said
he did not want the charge to dominate the profit and loss account in
future.
Other independent oil companies, including Lasmo, Clyde, and Aran, have made
accounting changes which depressed profits in 1991. The oil sector is
currently coming under extreme pressure from low oil prices and a weak
dollar.
Cairn's write-down leaves its oil and gas assets on the balance sheet at
Pounds 31.8m against shareholders' funds of Pounds 19m.
Turnover increased to Pounds 12.3m (Pounds 9.95m) but losses per share
plummeted to 113.7p (1.5p). Production increased to 1,708 (1,535) barrels of
oil a day and 15.5m (14.7m) cu ft of gas a day.

FT  09 APR 92 / UK Company News: Acquisitions help Ocean to Pounds 51m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OCEAN GROUP, the marine freight and environmental services conglomerate,
yesterday revealed a 6 per cent increase in 1991 profits helped by
acquisitions and a lower interest charge following last year's rights issue.
Pre-tax profits rose from Pounds 48m to Pounds 51m on sales up 22 per cent
at Pounds 1.35bn.
Stronger performances in the freight and distribution and marine divisions
were offset by a halving of the contribution from environmental services.
Earnings after the Pounds 88m rights issue fell to 24.6p (27p) and a final
dividend of 9.62p makes a 14.33p (14.2p) total.
Mr Nicholas Barber, chief executive, said organically the group grew 5 per
cent.
The group took market share to expand freight and distribution division
operating profits by 7 per cent to Pounds 23m despite City fears that this
was a prime candidate to be hit in recession.
Operating profits at MSAS, the freight forwarding company, and at McGregor
Cory, the storage and distribution company, rose 15 per cent and 25 per cent
respectively.
In the marine services division, profits grew 20 per cent to Pounds 30.9m, a
result that was unlikely to be repeated this year as cash flow constraints
hit exploration, Mr Barber said.
Gearing at year-end had fallen to 10 per cent, compared to 50 per cent in
December 1990, and Mr Barber expected the level to be about 20 per cent by
the end of 1992 assuming a capital spend broadly unchanged at about Pounds
50 to Pounds 70m.
COMMENT
One might not choose to be in freight forwarding and energy related
businesses with recession stalking the OECD countries and oil prices
languishing below Dollars 20. Yet Ocean has been remarkably resilient, a
credit to the management that has turned the old asset-heavy Ocean Transport
&amp; Trading into a leaner mini-conglomerate. The turn down in North Sea
activity since September will not help but Ocean has locked in 60 per cent
of 1992 offshore revenue with long term charters and is anyway well
positioned in more profitable locations like south-east Asia. On the
distribution side, McGregor Cory's new sites should benefit the group just
when freight forwarding's growth through increased market share might be
expected to be petering out. Nevertheless, in the absence of a dramatically
higher oil price and OECD growth rate, Ocean is unlikely to excite. Analysts
estimate pre-tax profits this year only marginally higher at Pounds 54m,
giving earnings of 24.5p and a fully priced prospective multiple of 13.

Pounds 9.2m

<TEXT>
BRAMMER, the ball bearing distributor and electronic services group,
yesterday reported its third consecutive year of declining profits with a
pre-tax return of Pounds 9.2m for 1991.
The result, which disappointed analysts who had expected Pounds 10m,
compared with Pounds 11.4m in 1990. Turnover fell from Pounds 122.5m to
Pounds 111.5m.
Mr Hugh Lang, chairman, defended the results, saying they were creditable
compared to many of Brammer's competitors. The group ended the year with a
strong balance sheet, carrying net cash of Pounds 3.8m.
BSL - the leading UK distributor of ball bearings and power transmission
products - suffered a 9 per cent decline in turnover to Pounds 91m and a 22
per cent fall in profits to Pounds 8.1m. Gross margins had been maintained,
however, Mr Lang said.
The group planned to expand this business into continental Europe. Mr Robert
Ffoulkes-Jones, chief executive, said talks were in progress with several
companies.
The equipment rental business, which focuses on environmental monitoring and
computer devices, saw sales decline by 10 per cent to Pounds 20.4m, with
profits down by 24 per cent to Pounds 1.5m. A break-even result in France,
and the exceptional charge of Pounds 382,000 for relocating the French
business, offset the profitable return in the UK.
The Italian rental subsidiary was closed, incurring a Pounds 718,000
extraordinary charge.
Earnings fell to 14.7p (17.5p). The final dividend is held at 8.5p, making
13p.

FT  09 APR 92 / UK Company News: Queens Moat below City forecasts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
QUEENS MOAT Houses, the hotels group, announced full-year pre-tax profits
down 3.9 per cent to Pounds 90.4m, slightly below market expectations, and
warned that there was no sign of a sustained recovery in its UK business.
A better performance on the Continent, where the company has 86 of its 190
hotels, helped raise profit before rent and interest to Pounds 157m for the
year to end-December against Pounds 142m in 1990. Profits at the pre-tax
level were dragged down by an increased interest charge of Pounds 56.8m
(Pounds 43.1m) and higher rent of Pounds 9.64m (Pounds 5.19m). Turnover was
Pounds 543m (Pounds 485m).
Despite a fall in fully-diluted earnings per share to 7.58p (8.59p), a
proposed final dividend of 1.54p raises the total to 2.882p (2.62p).
Mr John Bairstow, chairman, said: 'In more normal times we would have no
hesitation in anticipating a year of strong growth, especially with the
extremely good start to 1992 in our continental hotels. However, in the face
of the economic uncertainties, particularly in the UK, such optimism would
be misplaced.'
He added: 'It is reasonable for shareholders to expect a satisfactory
outcome in 1992 and a resumption of growth thereafter.'
Mr Bairstow said the continental hotels accounted for 42 per cent of profits
before interest and rent. Profits in Germany, where the group has 36 hotels,
and in the Netherlands, where it has 26, increased by 20 per cent. The group
had seen no evidence of a slowdown in Germany, where its hotels cater almost
exclusively for business travellers.
The UK business was shielded to some extent by the small number of hotels
the group has in London, where occupancies have fallen more sharply than in
the rest of the country. Mr Bairstow said the three London hotels had been
worse hit than those in the Midlands and the north of England.
'The flickers of improvement we have seen have been in those regions rather
than in London and the south east,' Mr Bairstow said.
Queens Moat also said it was making a recommended Pounds 6.9m cash offer for
the shares it does not already own in Chester International Hotel, a
four-star 152-room property near Chester city centre. Queens Moat manages
the hotel and has a 28 per cent fully diluted stake in it. Queens Moat and
Chester International have some directors in common and certain Queens Moat
directors and their families hold 2.9 per cent of Chester's ordinary shares.
Queens Moat said it had been advised on the deal by Chester's independent
directors and Charterhouse. It said Charterhouse would make the offer on its
behalf.

Immunology Limited of Cambridge is to be the first UK biotechnology company
to make an initial public offering in the US, writes Clive Cookson.
It hopes to raise at least Dollars 20m (Pounds 11.6m).
It has filed a registration statement with the Securities and Exchange
Commission to offer 2m shares in American Depositary Shares, at between
Dollars 10 and Dollars 12 each.
The company is changing its name to Cantab Pharmaceuticals, to reflect its
origins in biomedical research at Cambridge University and its current
location in Cambridge Science Park. The old name was thought to be confusing
because many companies and university departments use some form of the word
'immunology' in their titles.
The offering represents a little less than 30 per cent of Cantab's share
capital, valuing the company at about Dollars 70m. The shares should start
trading on Nasdaq in May.

setback in sales
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
A SHARP fall in interest charges helped profits at Bodycote International,
the metal technology group, rise by almost Pounds 1m to Pounds 11.5m last
year despite a 12 per cent fall in sales, writes Peggy Hollinger.
Mr John Chesworth, joint managing director, said the proceeds of selling
Skelmersdale Packaging in December 1990 had reduced interest charges by
Pounds 1.1m to Pounds 36,000. Gearing was cut from about 28 per cent to less
than 5 per cent.
The Skelmersdale disposal accounted for the fall in turnover from Pounds
75.5m to Pounds 66.5m for the year to December 31.
The group closed Brocklehurst Fabrics, the last of its traditional textile
businesses, resulting in a charge of Pounds 797,000 taken below the line.
The bulk of Bodycote's business is in metal treatment, first ventured into
in 1979, for industries such as aerospace and automotive. Operating profits
in the metal technology division moved ahead by 12 per cent to Pounds 6.6m
despite a setback in the aerospace industry following the Gulf war.
Mr Chesworth said that current trading in these businesses was encouraging.
The motor trade was not getting any worse, he said, while 90 per cent of
Bodycote's aerospace exposure was in the civil sector.
Elsewhere, the workwear rental business produced record profits of Pounds
2.6m, up 20 per cent.
Industrial and general operations, which include the packaging arm, saw a 22
per cent fall in profits to Pounds 2.9m, following the Skelmersdale sale.
Growth in earnings per share was hampered by the Pounds 2.5m placing of 1m
shares in April. Earnings rose from 27.1p to 27.8p.
An increase in the final dividend to 5.75p is proposed for a total of 9.25p
(8.75p).

FT  09 APR 92 / UK Company News: MTM agrees short-term facilities with
bankers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MTM, the speciality chemicals group, yesterday announced that it had
concluded a short-term agreement with its bankers following its breach of
covenants.
The group said the new facilities were for an initial period until April 30.
Negotiations with two syndicates led by Chase Manhattan of the US and
Standard Chartered, the international UK-based bank, were continuing with a
view to securing the group's longer-term funding, said MTM.
The company is believed to have debts of about Pounds 70m. Standard
Chartered has said its exposure to MTM's debt is minimal. The largest
shareholder in MTM last week was Midland Bank which held 6.79 per cent of
the shares. Schroder Investment Management held 6.51 per cent, while
Gartmore Investment Management held 6.14 per cent.
The group, which has said it will probably not pay a final dividend for the
year to December 31, has not yet given the date for publication of its
full-year accounts.
So far, BDO Binder Hamlyn, its auditors, have refused to sign off the
accounts because of disagreements about asset values.
The accountants have been asked to prepare a report on the reasons and
circumstances surrounding the shortfall in profits that triggered its
present crisis.
Postern Executive Group, the corporate management specialist, has also been
appointed to evaluate the group's financial and operational position. It
will recommend options for MTM's future strategic development. The shares
closed up 3p at 28p.

FT  09 APR 92 / UK Company News: Costain plans to continue debt reduction
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONE OF Costain Group's main messages yesterday, after announcing a Pounds
69.2m pre-tax loss for 1991, was the progress made on reducing debt.
Before last April's Pounds 77m rights issue, at 155p a share, net debt
reached Pounds 372m, gearing of well over 100 per cent. Thanks to that issue
and the Pounds 101m disposal of the investment property portfolio, year-end
gearing came down to 53 per cent on net debt of Pounds 168m.
This excludes Pounds 52m of off-balance sheet debt in the Spitalfields
development on the fringe of the City, and Pounds 38m of convertible
preference shares.
Mr Peter Costain, chief executive, said the group planned to reduce
borrowings further this year, again by disposals as cash flow was expected
to be neutral.
With the business now concentrating on engineering and construction and on
mining, candidates for sale included non-coal mining activities in the US
and properties in Australia.
The group has been struggling to reduce borrowings since the Pounds 124m
purchase of Pyro Energy, a US coal mining concern, in mid-1989. Gearing went
up from 25 per cent to 75 per cent as a result.
Not long after the purchase, an explosion at a Kentucky mine killed 10
people and closed the pit for 14 weeks. Productivity was badly affected and
Mr Costain admitted that the return so far on the investment was
disappointing.
After that acquisition, the group missed its gearing reduction targets and
by the end of 1990 the ratio stood at about 100 per cent. Since then Pounds
255m has been cut from borrowings.
The period has coincided with disappointments on the housing and commercial
property fronts. In 1988 the group sold nearly 1,900 houses. Last year it
sold 400.
The core engineering and construction business showed some resilience last
year, making an operating profit of Pounds 24.6m (Pounds 32.9m), after
Pounds 12m of provisions against the Channel tunnel contract. Turnover
slipped to Pounds 979m (Pounds 1.07bn).
Mr Costain said the international contracting workload had doubled,
cushioning the effects of UK recession.
Mining, which saw profits fall from Pounds 44.1m to Pounds 33.6m, should
improve, he said.

FT  09 APR 92 / UK Company News: Interest gain helps Proudfoot edge ahead to
'pleasing' Pounds 48m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ALEXANDER PROUDFOOT, the management consultancy and staff training group,
yesterday announced a slight increase in profits in spite of difficult
conditions in its important North American market.
The company reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 48m (Pounds 46m) in the year
to December 31, in line with expectations and aided by higher interest
gains.
Mr Neil Hamilton, finance director, said the results were 'very pleasing'.
Proudfoot's order book is about 10 per cent higher than a year ago. 'We are
very well positioned as the economies of the world develop,' he said.
Turnover slipped slightly to Pounds 176.4m (Pounds 178.5m), mainly due to a
decline in North America, where turnover fell to Pounds 58.8m (Pounds
66.8m).
North America's share of total turnover slipped to 33 per cent (37 per
cent).
Operating profits fell to Pounds 44.2m (Pounds 45.2m). But net interest
receivable rose to Pounds 3.78m (Pounds 858,000) mainly due to lower
servicing costs for the company's near-Pounds 30m debt, which is largely
dollar denominated. The company held net cash of Pounds 24.4m at the
year-end.
Last April's sale of BAS, the debt collection subsidiary, raised an
extraordinary profit of Pounds 2.09m.
Fully diluted earnings increased 4.8 per cent to 45.5p (43.4p). The
directors recommended a final dividend of 13.5p to make a total of 19.5p
(19p).
Indevo, the Scandinavian consultancy acquired last September for Pounds 12m
cash, made a small undisclosed contribution. Mr Hamilton said Indevo would
start to perform in the second half of this year and its margins, of about 8
per cent, could be improved.
COMMENT
Maintaining margins around 27 per cent through a recession, as Proudfoot has
managed to do, is no mean feat, even if it does prompt some clients to start
asking questions. Nevertheless, Proudfoot's cautious statement about the
outlook was sensible, even if such circumspection worried the market
slightly. The US is not convincingly out of recession, nor are the company's
main European markets of the UK, France and Germany easy to call.
First-half profits are likely to be depressed by investment in new products
and translation costs for existing course material, even though turnover
will be lifted by a full contribution from Indevo. Full-year forecasts of
Pounds 50m-Pounds 51m put the shares on a multiple of less than 8 with an
attractive 7 per cent yield.
They are worth holding, but potential buyers may prefer to wait until the
interim stage to assess how quickly any upturn is coming through.

FT  09 APR 92 / UK Company News: NatWest Bancorp returns to black with
Dollars 16m in first quarter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NATIONAL Westminster Bancorp, the US subsidiary of the UK's National
Westminster Bank, returned to profit in the first three months of 1991. This
was the first quarterly profit it has made in two years.
Profit after tax but before extraordinary items was Dollars 16m (Pounds
9.3m), compared with a Dollars 191m loss in the first three months of 1991.
The progress was due principally to a fall to Dollars 30.5m (Dollars 222m)
in provisions for losses on loans.
Mr John Tugwell, who took over a year ago as chairman of NatWest Bancorp,
said: 'Things are looking a little more rosy.' He added that in underlying
terms the US bank was making an 8 per cent annualised return on its equity,
which compares with a target rate of 15 per cent. He hopes to reach that
target rate in the next couple of years.
It is understood that NatWest will review whether it wishes to continue
owning the US bank when it is confident that the subsidiary is earning
respectable profits again.
NatWest Bancorp has been hurt particularly by the slump in the property
market in the north-east of the US, where most of its operations are based.
Mr Tugwell said that the rate at which customers were getting into
difficulties had been declining rapidly.
There has been a slight fall to Dollars 1.14bn (Dollars 1.15bn at the end of
1991) in the volume of loans classified as non-performing according to
standards set by US banking regulators.
In addition, the bank is managing properties and other assets worth Dollars
337m, down from Dollars 354m at the end of 1991, which it has taken under
its control from borrowers in severe difficulties.
Mr Tugwell said he has been making significant progress in reducing the
costs of managing these foreclosed properties. He has, for example,
negotiated discounts on the costs of insuring buildings and of hiring
security guards.

FT  09 APR 92 / Tokyo fall worries fund managers worldwide
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE fall in the Tokyo stock market is worrying fund managers around the
world. The anxiety, they say, goes beyond concern for the value of the
relatively small portion of UK and European portfolios in Japan.
The average UK pension fund manager has about 5 per cent of investments in
Tokyo, while life insurance companies have 3 per cent to 4 per cent there.
Mr Dick Barfield, chief investment officer at Standard Life, one of the UK's
largest insurance companies, said investors were painfully aware of the
extent to which Japanese banks were equity investors.
'The question is whether there is a knock-on effect for the banking system,'
Mr Barfield said. If banks have to liquidate holdings of other assets around
the world, it could send bond, share and property prices plummeting.
For some time now, Japanese banks have been less enthusiastic lenders
abroad, he said, a reflection of their own increasing concern about loan
losses.
Ms Caroline Burton, investment director at GRE Asset Management, said a big
recession in Japan would mean recovery in other countries could be delayed.
Significantly depressed share prices in Tokyo might spur her to shift out of
equities and into bonds.
Other fund managers urge caution about interpreting the sell-offs in Tokyo
in recent days. 'They tend to be clumsy sellers,' said Mr Leslie Robb,
investment chief at Scottish Widows, the UK life insurer. A drop in prices
on the French bourse yesterday is likely to be viewed as a buying
opportunity by continental institutions. Meanwhile, Mr Robb said the biggest
risk posed by Japanese lenders was to the US stock markets.
While the Japanese have invested more in US Treasuries than in equities, any
move away from the US, given the burgeoning budget deficit, could choke off
recovery there.

FT  09 APR 92 / Nokia Data slows fall at ICL
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ICL, the UK-based computer manufacturer in which Fujitsu of Japan has a
majority stake, was profitable in 1991, albeit at a reduced level, in the
worst trading environment the computer industry has experienced.
Operating profit was Pounds 78m, a 30 per cent decline on the previous
Pounds 112m. Revenue, however, rose 16 per cent to Pounds 1.87bn.
The rise reflected a three-month contribution from Nokia Data, the Finnish
personal computer operation bought last year. There were also contributions
from ICL's investment in CFM and Sorbus, the European computing services
companies specialising in maintenance and facilities management.
Without these contributions, revenue growth was essentially flat,
emphasising the effect of the recession on the company's main markets in the
US, UK and mainland Europe.
Mr Peter Bonfield, chairman and chief executive, said the group's
performance had been creditable in a difficult year. The group had incurred
substantial expenses as a result of the Nokia acquisition and new product
introductions. Research and development costs increased 4 per cent to Pounds
223m.
However, it was the first time the company had demonstrated that it could
increase its market share in Europe. The majority of its traditional
competitors lost money last year.
Net earnings amounted to Pounds 39m; after ordinary dividends, the company
will retain net cash of Pounds 31m. Group borrowings are now Pounds 51m,
equivalent to gearing of 17 per cent.
Mr Bonfield said he thought the current year would be as difficult as 1991.
However, he expected revenues to increase with the complete assimilation of
Nokia. Research expenses - now second in the UK only to Glaxo in terms of
expenditure per head - would grow but as a smaller percentage of sales.
ICL, owned 80 per cent by Fujitsu and 20 per cent by Northern Telecom of
Canada, has no need to report its results separately, but is doing so both
to emphasise its arm's-length relationship with its main shareholder and to
prepare for its eventual flotation on the London stock market. It is
committed to floating at least 25 per cent of its equity within the next
three years at a minimum price of 225p a share.

FT  09 APR 92 / Costain cuts payout as losses mount
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FALLING prices in UK housing and commercial property led to pre-tax losses
last year of Pounds 69.2m at Costain Group, the construction and mining
group.
The stock market had been braced for severe losses and a failure to pay a
final dividend. The share price closed 1p up at 66p yesterday.
The maintained interim dividend of 4.75p becomes the total, after 12.25p the
previous year.
Last year's pre-tax loss follows a profit of Pounds 5.5m in 1990, a fraction
of the peak Pounds 91.9m made in 1988. Turnover declined from Pounds 1.49bn
to Pounds 1.32bn.
One of the big minuses in last year's figures was a Pounds 32.5m exceptional
write-down on UK housing land, leaving a value of Pounds 65m on the
remaining bank. Mr Peter Costain, chief executive, said the running total
for housing write-downs was about Pounds 70m over the past three years.
He said: 'This reflects our position in the south of England, where land
prices have taken one hell of a knock.'
He added that if house prices fell further this year, it would lead to more
provisions. A related worry was the possibility of interest rates rising.
The other big exceptional loss was Pounds 34.3m on the sale of the UK
commercial property portfolio in December. However, the Pounds 101m disposal
price helped to reduce debt to less than Pounds 200m.
Earlier in the year, borrowings were cut by a Pounds 77m rights issue. By
December 30, with working capital also reduced, net debt stood at Pounds
168m compared with Pounds 311m the previous year. Gearing was cut from 85
per cent to 53 per cent.
Reorganisation costs, including cutting the UK workforce by 2,000 to 5,500,
led to a further Pounds 6m of exceptional charges.
Operating profits fell from Pounds 63m to Pounds 27.4m, including a Pounds
12m provision for losses on the Channel tunnel contract - in line with other
partners such as BICC.
Interest costs of Pounds 23m, down from Pounds 32.5m, were just covered,
giving a profit before exceptional items of Pounds 4.4m, compared with
Pounds 30.5m.
Operating losses in housing and commercial property were Pounds 14.6m,
whereas a Pounds 4m profit was made in 1990.
The loss per share was 37.5p, compared with earnings of 1.5p.

FT  09 APR 92 / UK groups plan US placements
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THREE more UK companies are poised to raise finance in the US private
placement market this week, adding to the growing number of overseas
corporations raising long-term debt funding from US institutional investors.
The deals come at a time of few public Eurobond offerings or large
syndicated bank borrowings by UK companies.
The proceeds of many of the placements are being used to repay outstanding
short-term bank debt.
Bankers in New York said Pilkington, the glass-maker, was considering a
Dollars 200m (Pounds 116m) placement of bonds with US institut- ional
investors. The securities will have a 15-year maturity.
Tate &amp; Lyle, the foods group, is placing Dollars 50m seven-year bonds and
Senior Engineering is raising Dollars 30m, also over 15 years.
Last week, Lucas Industries raised Dollars 100m 12-year finance from a group
of five US investors and Harrisons &amp; Crosfield raised Dollars 100m 10-year
and 12-year funding. The deals were arranged by Wertheim Schroder and
Barclay's de Zoete Wedd, respectively.
Lucas used the proceeds of its placement to repay all but Dollars 30m
outstanding commercial paper borrowings in the US market.
Mr David Creed, Tate &amp; Lyle treasurer, said the company hoped to use the
proceeds of a US private placement to refinance a maturing Dollars 100m
Eurobond and repay bank borrowings in the US. However, he said firm details
of the placement had not been fixed.
The companies are keen to lock into long-term committed funding while banks
are mostly unwilling to make unsecured loans of more than five years.
With the economic outlook uncertain, banks do not want to take on exposure
to corporate credit risk for long periods.
The public bond markets are equally wary of corporate credit risk.
Large companies can still raise funding at attractive rates in the Eurobond
market, but only up to 10-years maturity.
The US private placement market amounted to Dollars 160bn last year, but
overseas companies accounted for only between 5 per cent and 10 per cent of
the total raised.

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GOVERNOR Bill Clinton of Arkansas left New York yesterday after two
gruelling weeks of campaigning with the Democratic party's presidential
nomination firmly in his reach.
By winning in Tuesday's New York primary with 41 per cent of the vote, the
Arkansas governor vaulted the biggest hurdle his campaign has faced.
Victories in Wisconsin and Kansas on the same day added to his commanding
lead over both Mr Jerry Brown, the former governor of California, who is the
only major candidate still in the race, and Mr Paul Tsongas, who continues
to win votes even though he has formally suspended his campaign.
President George Bush, meanwhile, continued to record comfortable victories
in Republican party primaries.
Mr Clinton acknowledged yesterday that many voters still felt uncomfortable
with him because of the series of allegations about adultery, marijuana
smoking and draft dodging that have beset his campaign.
'I'm not interested in whether they love me or not. I want them to respect
me and want me to be their president,' he said.
Although Mr Tsongas surprised everyone by winning 29 per cent of the New
York vote, in spite of not campaigning, he said he would take several days
to decide whether to re-enter the race.
Most politicians in Washington believe that, even if Mr Tsongas decides to
relaunch his candidacy, he will do so with a severely limited campaigning
schedule.
Mr Brown, however, vowed to soldier on, despite being largely repudiated by
voters in New York, where he won only 25 per cent of the vote. He fared
better in Wisconsin with 35 per cent.
Clinton supporters were yesterday campaigning intensely to win over the 772
Democratic party committee members and congressmen who will also take part
in the nominating convention as 'super-delegates.'
Mr Clinton is estimated to have the backing of 213 of them already, as well
as 50 per cent of the 2,197 delegates so far allotted by primaries and
caucuses.

FT  09 APR 92 / Retailers accused of penalising credit customers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BARCHARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BARCLAYS BANK attacked high street retailers yesterday, accusing them of
blackmail and holding their customers to ransom in their efforts to prevent
banks raising their credit and debit card charges.
The claim followed revelations earlier this week by Tesco, the food store
which chairs the Debit Card Users Group, that banks charge substantially
more for electronic debit card transactions than they do for cheques.
Tesco's managing director Mr David Malpas, speaking on Tuesday after the
company announced increased annual pretax profits, said his company might
fight the increased prices for card services on its customers' behalf - if
necessary by banning card payments.
Mr Richard Reay-Smith, chief executive of Barclays Central Retail Services
Division, the largest credit and debit card organisation in the UK, said:
'Over the last three years card processing charges levied on retailers have
reduced sharply - by over 25 per cent on credit cards and over 40 per cent
on debit cards. Consumers have not seen the benefits of these reductions in
the prices they pay at the point of sale.'
Mr Reay-Smith said that retailers were threatening to penalise customers by
refusing to accept cards or by charging extra for transactions.
'High Street shoppers will take a dim view of blackmail by some retailers
which could prevent them buying goods with credit and debit cards or force
them to pay more through surcharges,' he added.
Banks claim that retailers enjoy substantial benefits through accepting
cards, including quicker guaranteed payment, reductions in processing and
security costs, and a flow of extra customers who prefer to pay by card.
'These far outweigh any extra cost to the retailers,' Mr Reay-Smith said.
Barclays confirmed yesterday that banks charge some retailers more for debit
card transactions than for cheques.
'Our minimum charge for cheque transactions is about 4p, though it can rise
to 63p for small business customers,' a Barclays spokesman said. Debit cards
carry a flat transaction charge of 12p reflecting the increased security and
convenience of these payments.

FT  09 APR 92 / The Lex Column: Queens Moat
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It was a pity Queens Moat's poor presentation of two relatively minor
matters distracted attention yesterday from a fine performance last year. In
marking its shares down by 5 per cent, the market concentrated on a
surprisingly fully-priced but small UK acquisition and a confusing stance on
depreciation policy. But as Forte's forthcoming results will doubtless
confirm, Queens Moat managed a significantly better trading result than its
peers.
The reasons for the mere 4 per cent fall in annual pre-tax profits were
evident at the interim stage last August. The continental European hotels,
particularly in Germany, grew fast enough to offset most of the effects of
recession in the UK. Granted, the UK business was hard enough hit for the
group's self-employed managers to negotiate a 6 per cent fall in their
annual contributions. But on the other hand, that should allow UK profits to
recover more strongly when the market eventually improves, although more
than half of future revenues will be generated in Europe. On a forward
multiple of just 10, the shares look better value than Forte. But given the
sector's abiding lack of fashion among investors, that scarcely amounts to a
ringing endorsement.

FT  09 APR 92 / The Lex Column: Costain
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Yesterday saw the culmination of a nightmarish year for Costain: the
announcement of net losses for 1991 equivalent to two-thirds of the group's
market value, plus failure to pay the dividend promised with last year's
Pounds 77m rights issue. At 66p, the shares languish at a third of their
level immediately after the cash call.
Given such disappointment, the market will not be easily convinced that the
worst is over. The company's contention is that a return to group
profitability can be driven by sustained earnings growth from the high
quality mining assets, particularly in the US. Contracting margins on oil
and gas projects are holding up, even if the dominant UK business will
suffer. Meanwhile, repair work on the balance sheet - still burdened by
unacceptably high gearing - can continue, given a fair wind for disposals.
The question is whether operating cash flow really will be neutral this
year, and whether the UK residential and commercial property markets will
inflict further damage before Costain's exit is complete. Last year's land
bank write-down may yet prove insufficiently pessimistic, while the
unchanged Spitalfields valuation is based on a large number of very
long-term assumptions. Notwithstanding management's fighting talk, there is
no rush to buy the shares. But they would certainly be cheap if widely
mooted profits of Pounds 15m were actually achieved this year, and an annual
dividend were paid equal to last year's interim.

It would be wrong to ascribe the attack of nerves afflicting Wall Street to
selling by Japanese investors anxious to offset losses in their domestic
market. Japanese investment in US financial markets has always flowed most
heavily into government securities, which have reacted much more stolidly
than equities to this week's fall in the Nikkei. Granted, Japanese banks
themselves may be under pressure as a result of problem lending to the
property sector, and have been selling domestic bonds. But they have even
fewer US equities to sell than other financial institutions.
The connection between the Dow's gyrations and the fall in the Nikkei
appears both more simple and less pernicious in its broader ramifications.
Events in Japan have helped crystallise the view that US equities are
overbought. Wall Street's historic multiple of 25 looks high when first
quarter earnings are unlikely to show much benefit from recovery. The
recovery itself now appears more anaemic than originally expected. It will
not be helped if the Japanese economic slowdown spreads to the rest of South
East Asia while European growth is kept at bay by the Bundesbank.
Moreover, the Dow has been painting a more optimistic picture than broader
indices such as the S&amp;P Composite. Its heavier weighting in fashionable
stocks such as Ford, GM and Disney leaves it at about the same level as the
start of the year. The S&amp;P, by contrast, which is skewed more heavily to
last year's favourites such as drug and food companies, has fallen so far
this year by some 6 per cent.

FT  09 APR 92 / The Lex Column: The case for sterling
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Amid the welter of snap judgments facing the UK markets tomorrow, it helps
to keep sight of a few fundamentals. First, the key determinant is the
behaviour of sterling. Second, devaluation - whatever the election outcome -
is highly unlikely. Third, a fall in sterling big enough to force a rise in
interest rates, while plainly a danger, is not very likely either.
The argument runs as follows. The chief priority of a minority government,
whether Labour or Tory, would be preparing for the next election. In a
sterling crisis, it would have to calculate whether its chances would be
more damaged by devaluation or higher interest rates. It would surely
conclude that whereas a base rate rise might with luck be reversible before
an election, the blowing of sterling's credibility within the ERM would be
all too permanent.
If, on the other hand, tomorrow's result was so close as to produce no
government to speak of, the Bank of England would simply play by ERM rules.
At the other extreme, a majority Labour government might be tempted to
renege on its ERM commitment. But, as Labour must be aware, it cannot have
it both ways. If it wants to spend, it must borrow. There is simply no
evidence that Mr John Smith would be rash enough to raise the cost of
attracting foreign money by destroying confidence in the currency.
As for a rise in interest rates, it is striking that on the eve of the
election three-month money is only 0.25 per cent above base rate. It must
also be recalled that an attack on sterling would first be met by the
combined firepower of the Bundesbank and the Bank of England. Even if that
did not stop the speculators, they would only press on if they thought the
government would crack and settle for devaluation after all. And if the
market really believed that, sterling would scarcely have closed yesterday 6
pfennigs above its D-Mark floor.

FT  09 APR 92 / Dollars 24bn aid to Russia threatened: IMF concern over
economic concessions made by Yeltsin's government
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE RUSSIAN government's moves to slacken economic reform and credit policy
are threatening aid promised from the west, officials of international
economic institutions warned yesterday.
The World Bank and the International Monetary Fund are concerned that
concessions the Russian government has had to make, in the face of a
conservative onslaught on its reform programme, will render useless the
proposed Dollars 24bn (Pounds 14bn) aid announced last week by US president
George Bush and Mr Helmut Kohl, the German chancellor.
This is seen as especially true of the Dollars 6bn fund earmarked for the
stabilisation of the rouble. One official said last night: 'It is hard to
see aid flowing in large amounts if the programme proposed to the IMF is
substantially altered. If they don't get what looks like a fixed exchange
rate for the rouble they won't get the money to stabilise it.'
In the past three days of sessions of the Russian Congress of Peoples
Deputies, the government has made clear that it intends to grant credits of
up to Rbs200bn to agriculture and industry, and to raise pensions and other
benefits.
However, even these concessions may not be enough to placate the deputies.
Last night it emerged that the commission preparing a resolution on economic
reform, due to be debated today, had narrowly voted to propose President
Boris Yeltsin should be stripped of his emergency powers - including his
post as prime minister.
Mr Yegor Gaidar, the first deputy prime minister, told a meeting of the
deputies supporting the government: 'As soon as Yeltsin gives up his powers
as prime minister there is no government in Russia any longer. Everything
would be paralysed. All of the government would immediately resign.'
However, another minister revealed that the cabinet had prepared a list of
names of those with whom it would be prepared to work as replacement prime
ministers, and another list of names with whom it would not be prepared to
work.
Russian membership of the IMF is expected to go through at the end of this
month. However, an agreed programme of assistance could be delayed
indefinitely if the reforms are off course. Western calculations suggest
that the size of the budget deficit in the first quarter of the year stands
at between 8 and 15 per cent of the gross domestic product.
One western adviser said: 'If they really were closing enterprises and
laying people off then there might be a case for putting more credit into
industry. But they're not at that point yet, so it's hard to believe it's a
good idea.'
Mr Laurence Summers, chief adviser to the World Bank, said: 'The worldwide
lesson is that hard budget constraints are not a sufficient condition for
the reform of enterprises, but that they are necessary.' He would not
comment on how the reforms would affect the international financial
institutions' posture.

FT  09 APR 92 / Letter: Questionable wisdom of holding trade in services to
ransom
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Sir DEREK THOMAS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Our friends at the US Coalition of Services Industries have again
raised their concerns about free riders in the General Agreement on Tariffs
and Trade Services (Gatts) negotiations: Margaret Wigglesworth's letter,
appearing coincidentally on April 1, may be primarily intended to tease us,
but perhaps it is wise to take it at face value.
We fully expect the CSI's continuing efforts, alongside our own, for market
access commitments. This is certainly crucial. But to leave the argument as
Margaret Wigglesworth does risks stranding us all in the era of bilateral
reciprocity instead of seizing this historic chance to conclude a pact on
services trade principles and rules among the major trading nations.
There are already nearly 50 offers on the table, accounting for about 95 per
cent of world trade in services; thus a critical mass appears assured.
Naturally at this stage we are not looking at the bottom lines, but the OECD
group and a number of notable others promise to be comprehensive and very
acceptable. Thus the US, as the world's largest economy, representing a
quarter of world GNP, presumably has in its sights half a dozen worst
offenders - most of these unable to take advantage of the US and EC open
markets. For this target, is it wise to be holding to ransom, through the
exhaustive US list of threatened most favoured nations exemptions, the
progress of the past five years' negotiations?
Under the proposed multilateral trade organisation, of which Gatts will form
part, there will be two yearly chances to press for progressive
liberalisations from member countries which lag unfairly in their
obligations. But should the Uruguay Round fail, future governments and new
officials will be condemned, like Sisyphus, to roll another Round back up
the hill, following much loss of time and wealth foregone. If we focus too
closely on short-term gains we may live to regret not having taken a
longer-term, wider view.

FT  09 APR 92 / Letter: Spiral into unequal losses for external Lloyd's
Names
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr R B SPOONER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, While the forecasts for the 1989 Lloyd's losses may be similar for
working and external Names with some individual agencies (Letters, April 2
and 4), this is certainly not the case for the market as a whole.
My own calculations, based on the split of external/working capacity by
syndicate recently released by Lloyd's, and on the forecasts by
underwriters, suggest that working Names will incur a 12 per cent loss in
1989, while external Names will incur a 16.5 per cent loss.
In 1988, working Names had 1.2 per cent lower losses than external Names; in
1989, if the forecast holds, 4.5 per cent. So if working Names do not put
their own interests first, how did we get such an unequal result?
Perhaps the problem lies in the LMX spiral. The seven largest loss makers in
1989, accounting for more than a third of the market loss, are all LMX
syndicates. All had below average working capacity. External Names on these
syndicates have been left holding the can and in many cases facing financial
ruin.
It is to be hoped that Sir David Walker, chairman of the Securities and
Investments Board, can come up with a convincing explanation and some
equally convincing remedies.

FT  09 APR 92 / Playing for high stakes on the picket line: The strike at
Caterpillar, America's number two industrial exporter, is entering the
end-game
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON and BARBARA DURR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A discordant honking of car horns, echoing this week through the
early-morning streets of Peoria, Illinois, heralded the moment of truth in
the most crucial test of US organised labour in a decade.
The horns, blaring out along the route to Caterpillar's factories and
headquarters in this archetypal Mid-Western city, were one way that striking
workers at the world's largest marker of earth-moving equipment tried to
deter suspected strikebreakers from crossing their picket lines. In a touch
of modernity, the strikers also trained video cameras on the factory gates.
After a five-month stand-off, the Caterpillar stoppage has entered the
end-game, thanks to a management ultimatum that striking members of United
Auto Workers union had to return by last Monday or face losing their jobs to
replacement workers. Few of the 12,600 strikers have gone back, but the
company is gambling that many will return in the days and weeks to come.
If they do, it will mark a grave setback for the UAW, still one of the most
powerful unions in a country that has seen a remarkable diminution of
organised labour over the past two decades.
The knock-on effects could be tremendous. Other companies with UAW workers -
notably the Detroit-based motor industry - would try to use the defeat to
extract concessions. And employers across the US would be encouraged to
adopt a tougher negotiating stance with unions.
But if the workers do not return, Caterpillar, the second-biggest US
industrial exporter after Boeing, could be badly hurt. The outcome is finely
balanced, and with such high stakes on both sides neither is likely to cave
in easily.
The dispute centres on three inter-related issues which have become central
to management-labour tussles over the past decade: so-called 'pattern
bargaining'; management's right to replace striking workers with non-union
staff; and the role played by organised labour in hindering or helping
American competitiveness.
The UAW has used pattern bargaining in negotiations with US auto companies
for decades. The idea is to negotiate a favourable labour contract with the
company most willing to make concessions and then make the others match the
terms. Such deals used to be common in several industries, including steel
and tyres, but have become less so over the past decade.
The Detroit motor groups, fearful of losing market share through a prolonged
strike, have gone along with the system but now want to break out. They face
ferocious competition in a recessionary market from more efficient and
largely non-union Japanese plants which have mushroomed across America.
General Motors, in particular, which lost about Dollars 7bn at the operating
level in North America last year, is anxious to slim down and introduce more
flexible working practices. But the UAW has rejected the company's attempts
to renegotiate the 1990 labour contract, due for renewal next year.
The UAW also wants Caterpillar to 'pattern bargain' and agree to terms on
pay, conditions and job security similar to those it reached last year with
Deere &amp; Co, another large US equipment maker.
But Caterpillar, which went along with pattern bargaining in the past,
argues that it can no longer afford it. It maintains that its labour costs
must allow it to compete with its main international rival, Japan's Komatsu,
rather than other American businesses.
The union rejects such arguments, saying that international competitiveness
is more a result of shrewd management, employing efficient manufacturing
processes. It claims, instead, that its members are being asked to forgo
benefits which the company can afford. 'Global competitiveness is a code for
bottom-line greed,' says one union organiser.
It is the management's threat to bring in replacement labour that touches
the rawest union nerve. President Ronald Reagan's use of this tactic to
defeat the government-employed air traffic controllers in 1981, set the tone
for a decade of anti-unionism in the White House. The strategy has since
been successfully emulated by several leading companies, most recently
Greyhound, the bus line.
In the US, the right of management to replace workers is not unfettered: a
company found guilty of unfair labour practices can be forced to re-hire
sacked strikers. The union movement is lobbying Congress for stronger
protection, but is unlikely to be successful.
Caterpillar would find little problem in recruiting workers, since
unemployment is high in both Peoria and the company's other manufacturing
centres in Illinois. It began placing newspaper advertisements for staff
this week and was flooded with telephone inquiries.
It is now anxious to resume production, with or without the UAW, in view of
the upturn in the US economy expected in the second half of this year. Its
inventories are very low - about 80 per cent down on pre-strike levels,
according to one estimate.
'Caterpillar doesn't want to be stuck in a strike' just as orders begin to
come in, says Mr Tobias Levkovich, an analyst with Smith Barney Harris
Upham, the US securities company. In the last UAW strike at the company in
1982-83, which lasted seven months and was the longest in the union's
history, the management was caught short as the seasonal construction
business picked up, and was forced into a compromise settlement.
However, in using replacement workers, lacking the complicated skills of its
existing workforce, Caterpillar risks a decline in the quality of its
products and a loss of market share and customer loyalty. And if it
ultimately settled with the UAW, labour relations would be soured for years.
Although the union has few cards left to play, it has not ruled out idling
the remaining 3,400 UAW members still working at Caterpillar's parts and
warehousing operations. Beyond that there remains the outside possibility of
concerted action by other unions, fearful for their future. Leaders of two
other big unions, the steelworkers and the Teamsters, have already said the
Caterpillar strike is crucial to the future of the labour movement.
Such comments come against the background of a steady erosion of union power
in the US. Over the past two decades the movement has suffered a precipitous
fall in membership to a level one academic recently described as 'ghetto
unionism'. Only 16 per cent of the non-agricultural workforce belonged to
unions in 1990, down from nearly 30 per cent in 1970.
Reasons for the weakening of organised labour include the decline of heavily
unionised traditional industries; and shifts of business from the unionised
north to the cheap-labour south, and from manufacturing to the fragmented
service sector, where unions have difficulty recruiting.
The question now is whether America's unions can carve out a new role for
themselves in an era when complicated new manufacturing techniques demand
greater flexibility in work practices and more co-operation between
management and labour.
But management and unions at Caterpillar, like their counterparts across the
US automobile and equipment industries, are set in their confrontational
ways. 'Pulling together' is not a message playing well in Peoria this week.

FT  09 APR 92 / A tune-up for City trades: The London Stock Exchange is
gearing up for another Big Bang
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The London stock market is on the verge of its next Big Bang. Five and a
half years after reforms were introduced to reshape share trading in the
City, the Stock Exchange's board will today consider a further overhaul of
its markets. At stake is not only whether the UK's domestic stock market can
be made to work more efficiently for all its users, but whether London can
consolidate its position as the leading centre for international share
trading in Europe.
Mr Peter Rawlins, an iconoclastic 41-year-old accountant brought in as chief
executive two and a half years ago to implement the next phase of reform, is
clear about the need for sweeping changes. 'Without them, the exchange will
run the same risk as in the years before Big Bang,' he warned an audience of
pension fund investment managers recently. 'It will be trapped by its own
history.'
The years since Big Bang have not been easy for the London securities
industry. While the level of trading on the stock market soared after 1986,
the crash of 1987 brought the City back to earth with a bump. Since then,
the level of trading has fluctuated, making it difficult for brokers and
market-makers to reap sustained profits. With this underlying problem - in
part caused by continued overcapacity in the London market - the stock
market which emerged after Big Bang has looked anything but settled.
The UK's domestic market, and the international share market in London -
each of which trades roughly the same value of shares - face different
challenges. The domestic market is beset by three distinct difficulties.
First, market - makers, the traders who provide the backbone of the London
market, have been unable to make a decent return (most aim for 20-25 per
cent) on the Pounds 3.5bn of capital which collectively they commit to
support share trading in the City.
The willingness of these firms to quote prices at which they will buy or
sell shares - and to put up their own capital to back that commitment - is
what distinguishes London from most other leading stock markets. The
arrangement, modelled on Nasdaq, the US over-the-counter share market,
offers investors the chance of dealing at any time and in large amounts. In
stock market jargon, that makes London a highly liquid market.
Market-makers warn that if they cannot make a decent profit they will stop
offering this service.
Large investors such as pension funds and insurance companies are almost
universal in their support for the current system of market-making and want
to see it strengthened. 'If we don't go down this road, there is a danger of
the business going off-market,' says Mr Angus Matheson, chairman of the
investment committee of the National Association of Pension Funds. 'That
would lead to fragmentation.'
Extra support for market-makers is to come later this year in the form of a
change to the disclosure rules in the UK market. Market-makers will no
longer be required to publish details of all their deals within 90 minutes.
This greater degree of secrecy should make it easier for them to make a
profit, since their competitors will not know the prices at which they are
dealing.
Institutional shareholders accept the change - even though it means they
will have less information on which to judge whether they are getting the
best price for shares. One said: 'I can't think of any other business in
which wholesalers have to say what they have bought and how much they paid
for it.'
The second problem for the domestic stock market has been that share trading
in London is concentrated on only about 250 companies. For the rest, which
trade infrequently, the market-making system does not work. Spreads (the
difference between prices at which shares are bought or sold) have widened
steadily, and now stand at about 10 per cent for many listed companies. This
discourages buying, and has caused the market in some companies' shares to
stagnate.
Third, private investors have become the poor relations in a stock market
which was designed mainly for institutional investors. They have to pay a
spread to market-makers - even though they rely less on the service they
provide - thus adding unnecessarily to the cost of their dealing.
Together, these pressures have contributed to the exchange's greatest worry:
the fear that trading will begin to seep away, moving on to other trading
systems off-exchange. It would be unable to legislate against such a move
and has no monopoly on stock market trading.
Also, the prices quoted by market-makers - the single most important facet
of the market - are publicly available, and so could easily be used as a
basis for transacting business off-exchange.
For the moment, fragmentation remains just a fear. 'We've talked about doing
business off-market, but haven't felt the need yet,' the head of one of the
largest market-making firms said. But, like others, he feels increasingly
exasperated. 'The Stock Exchange keeps saying it no longer represents us,
the big firms - that it's no longer a club. One day they will go too far.'
Investors continue to back the exchange, though in some cases reluctantly.
An attempt to develop a system on which institutions could do business
directly with each other, bypassing the market, flopped in the early 1980s.
Similar systems are currently being promoted. Instinet, an electronic
marketplace run by Reuters, the UK information group, boasts about 10 per
cent of the turnover in US shares, and has begun a push into the European
market.
Some institutions claim that the exchange fails to consider their interests.
'The Stock Exchange still thinks it always knows best,' said Mr Barry
Southcote, managing director of marketable securities at CIN, the manager of
the coal industry pension fund.
While the UK's domestic stock market has struggled, international share
trading has been one of London's successes in recent years. A telephone
market for international shares had already existed in London, but operated
without any of the services that an official stock exchange provides. In the
mid-1980s the exchange launched Seaq International, a price display system
on which dealers could quote prices at which they would buy or sell foreign
stocks. The market supported by this system has forged ahead: 95 per cent of
European stocks bought or sold outside their home markets now change hands
in London.
This surging international share market could now be under threat. As other
European centres push through reforms to their own stock markets and cut
taxes on securities trading (an important reason for the migration of share
trading to London), London's dominant position is no longer assured. The
proportion of trading in German shares in London, for instance, declined
last year - although London's overall market share rose.
Mr Rudiger von Rosen, executive vice-president of the German Federation of
Stock Exchanges, spelled out the determination to win trading in German
shares back from London. 'Our first priority is to offer a market for D-Mark
products which in terms of cost and efficiency is the best available,' he
said.
The exchange's response to both the domestic and the international challenge
has so far failed to set the City alight. After two and a half years, Mr
Rawlins has succeeded in slashing the exchange's cost base (staff numbers
have fallen from about 3,000 to fewer than 2,000). But exchange users are
still waiting for the long-term reforms which would put London's domestic
and international stock markets on a firmer footing.
'There is a dissatisfaction with the level of urgency with which the
exchange has gone about things,' said Mr Charles Nunnelly, chairman of the
Institutional Fund Managers Association, a trade association of big
investors.
After today's board meeting, the pace of change may accelerate. Though much
of the detail of the proposals being put to the board has been kept under
wraps, the exchange's strategy is clear: to create distinct market systems
serving both its main institutional investors and its private investors.
That way, it hopes, it would please all its users all the time, and
guarantee that the maximum amount of business continues to pass through the
official Stock Exchange. The wholesale market would operate on minimum
levels of regulation and disclosure, and would bring together the markets
for UK and international shares on a single system, aimed at big
internationally minded investors.
Finding a way of linking the retail and wholesale share markets has caused
much of the delay. Under the exchange's plans, small orders to buy and sell
shares would be fed into a central computer, where trades would be carried
out automatically. All investors would thus be assured that they were
getting the best price.
For instance, private investors would be able to specify prices at which
they wanted to buy or sell shares (known as 'limit orders'). Then, if a
large wholesale order was carried out at a better price, the limit orders
would be completed automatically - much as happens at the New York Stock
Exchange.
Carrying through this strategy is the hard part. It will involve substantial
spending, as the exchange finally scraps its many, varied systems and
creates a single technological base on which to run its markets. Securities
houses fear this will add substantially to their costs - on top of the
spending already related to the development of London's planned paperless
settlement system, Taurus. The exchange claims that any additional spending
will be more than covered by cost savings.
Convincing the exchange's users to make the necessary investment will be Mr
Rawlins's hardest task. After the constant delays that have beset the Taurus
project, confidence in the City in the exchange's ability to push through
technological developments is not high. Without investment, though, London's
leading position among European stock markets could come under threat.
Revamping the Stock Exchange is likely to be a necessary cost of staying
ahead.

FT  09 APR 92 / Leading Article: The day of decision
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BRITISH electorate, to judge by the opinion polls, is about to vote into
power either a minority Labour government or - just possibly - a Labour
government with a tiny overall majority. That is not the choice of business,
which would prefer an outright winner to resolve political uncertainties,
and would much prefer that winner to be Conservative.
But despite its risks and short-term costs, the likely outcome may be in the
best longer-term interests of the UK. The Financial Times's values are
closer to those of a modern Conservative party than to any other - that it
is to say, a belief in the market economy, a limited role for the state, low
taxation and maximum freedom of choice. But there are three serious
reservations about the present government's being offered an unprecedented
fourth term of office.
The first is performance. It is hard to overstate the achievements of
Conservative governments in the 1980s: trade union reform, privatisation,
disciplined public finances and an open economy are just the most obvious.
Since the last election in 1987, however, serious economic mistakes have
been made, as those responsible have recently admitted, and there have been
fatal signs of hubris - most notably in the poll tax disaster. In his 16
months as prime minister, Mr Major deserves credit for scrapping the poll
tax, for his Maastricht deal and for holding firm to a difficult economic
course, but some of his new ideas have either been superficial, like the
Citizen's Charter, or fumbled, like the reform of British Rail.
Real weakness
The second is promise. The shortcomings of the Tory campaign have not been
the result only of poor presentation. Rather they reflect a real weakness at
the heart of Tory policymaking. The party has not yet come to terms with the
departure of Mrs Thatcher, and is suffering an identity crisis as a result.
Does it stand for Thatcherism with a soft voice - if such a thing is
plausible - or has it become something completely different, such as a
European-style Christian Democratic party? It has almost nothing to say
about the need to reform the way the country is governed, even though it is
now clear that change is both inevitable and desirable. The party's
manifesto is a job lot of ideas with little sense of drive or direction.
The third reservation is that, as the electorate has correctly sensed, a
healthy democracy requires change and choice in the character of its
government; if only one party has power of patronage, stagnation is a real
danger. It would require very compelling arguments to re-elect any party
after 13 years in power: the Tories look as if they have run out of steam,
and need to rethink their priorities away from the cares of office.
But although there are reservations about the Conservatives, there are also
serious worries about the alternatives. To some audiences, the Labour party
talks the language of the markets; to others, it urges a break with the
enhanced competitive spirit which lies at the heart of Britain's improved
economic performance since Labour was last in office. In the very tough
economic circumstances which face the next government of Britain, no-one can
be sure which of these voices will be decisive. Labour's campaign has
promised enhanced economic performance which nothing in its programme
suggests it can deliver. In that case, the public spending ambitions of its
manifesto will be unattainable and its most loyal supporters angrily
disappointed.
Backward look
Most worrying of all, Labour is in many policy areas looking backwards to a
better future. Its proposals on health, its instincts on education and its
meritless minimum wage are the most striking examples. The speed and scale
of its tax distribution proposals are unjust and will damage Britain's
competitiveness.
The message of the polls is that the public is fearful of either of these
large parties' forming the next government. In spite of four weeks of
intense campaigning, neither has put on a solid, single point in its opinion
poll rating.
The only party which can make that claim is the Liberal Democrat, but its
own identity is an uneasy blend of single-issue pressure group and would-be
coalition partner. The spending figures in its manifesto do not add up, and
its myriad policies combine the good, such as an independent central bank,
with the gimmicky, such as a hypothecated tax for education. The party's
slick image cannot conceal the incoherence of its recent history.
All this points to the likelihood of an indecisive judgment by the voters; a
hung parliament, during which the prime minister will have to look over his
shoulder at every step. No party is trusted to go it alone with a strong
majority. It is possible to view this prospect with some equanimity,
however, precisely because Britain's last strong and effective government -
namely the first two administrations of Mrs Thatcher - achieved so much that
is irreversible.
Labour looks likely to be behind the steering wheel. The right role of any
back seat drivers will be to nurture Labour's market-oriented instincts and
to give it courage against the desire to slip into reverse. If a stable
seating plan for passengers can be agreed, so much the better, though no one
should think it would be easily achieved. The best hope is that with strong
coaxing, Labour in office can shed its reactionary alter ego and become the
outward looking social democratic party which represents the only viable
destination for the left in European politics.
If this election were solely a choice between party leaders, Mr Major would
be preferable. But it is not. The dangers of perpetuating in power a
weakened and uncertain Conservative party, set alongside the progress Labour
has made in modernising itself, justify by a fine margin the risks of a
change.

The temptation to vote green today is almost overwhelming. We learned
yesterday that the atmosphere over Europe lost about a fifth of its
protective ozone layer during the winter. This does not quite amount to an
ozone hole, but the figures square with the scientists' expectation that
winter losses in the northern hemisphere will double over the next decade.
A threat of such a magnitude is of greater importance than a prolonged
debate about whether it would be right for the Labour party to tax away an
extra fifth of the marginal incomes of individuals earning more than Pounds
40,000 a year. In the former case, we are talking about, at the least, a
general addition to the incidence of skin cancer. The most serious effect of
Labour's tax increases would be to squeeze middle-income earners.
Likewise, the prospect that the earth summit in Rio this summer will be a
fiasco matters a lot. The perverse correlation between the Conservatives'
protestations that they are tough on crime and the steep rise in reported
misdemeanours matters only a little. The first has to do with the long-term
health of the planet; the second is largely about breaking into parked cars.
Unfortunately, Britain's leaderless Green party comes across as such a weird
collection of disorganised dreamers that even the deepest sympathiser with
the environmental movement must hesitate before deciding whether to support
it. The Conservatives, Labour and the Liberal Democrats would protest that
there is no need to do so. Oh yes? It is true that protestations of good
intent on the environment appear in the manifestos of all three national
parties, but beyond that the subject has been ignored.
Come to think of it, several of the other serious issues that governments
will have to face in the 1990s have not arisen in the campaign. For example,
no big party has chosen to educate the public about the demographic
projections for the next 10 to 20 years. Yet during that time, Britain, in
common with continental western Europe and North America, will have to find
the funds to keep an increasingly elderly population alive, housed and fed.
Labour has bid for the grey vote with a shameless dispersal of higher
pensions to every retired person regardless of how wealthy she or he may be.
The Conservatives are seducing present-day earners into private pensions.
The Lib Dems have plans that I would take the trouble to look up if I
thought they had any chance of forming a government. But there has been no
proper exposition of the underlying actuarial forecasts.
Growth itself is another more immediately pressing concern that has not
received the attention it deserves. For neither the nature nor the pace of
economic development can be taken for granted. This is true of both the
medium-term and the immediate future. Whoever walks into the Treasury to
take the chancellorship tomorrow may find apologetic officials wringing
their hands and confessing that, sorry, the forecasts presented in Mr Norman
Lamont's budget last month are not exactly right. The government may have to
borrow, not Pounds 28bn as then hazarded, but thirtysomething billion.
If the recession is made abroad, as the Conservatives say it is, the new
administration will have to wait for the foreigners to take us out of it.
How, then are the growth rates assumed in the Red Book accompanying Mr
Lamont's statement to be achieved? The figure of Pounds 28bn looks like an
underestimate. This theme has been explored during the campaign, but not
sufficiently.
What the election debate has taught us is that the contemporary democratic
process is perverted by the need to work in sound-bites. The big set-piece
press conferences - on recession, recovery, health, education, foreign
affairs, crime, and housing - have all begun with the reading out of short,
easily digestible statements and concluded with the TV cameras watching
journalists ask limited questions.
In these circumstances, there is little prospect of presenting even the
outlines of an argument about such complicated matters as the environment,
the aging population, or long-term growth rates. This is not what the voter
is thought to want to know about. The Scots can understand talk of the end
of the English ascendancy, but very few people will listen to, let alone
consider, wider propositions on constitutional reform.
None of the leading politicians has been able to give a second's thought to
such genuine problems. Over the past few weeks, Labour shadow ministers have
been bemused when asked about a possible re-alignment of the Left; they had
that day's homework to do and could hardly get through it. The Conservatives
spent their time trying to get coherence into their daily tactics. The
Liberal Democrat leader demonstrated his skill at being in three places at
once.
The ozone layer and the advancing hordes of frail, poverty-stricken old
ladies looking for income support could go hang. Growth was something not to
think about, but to promise, for that may win votes. Thank heavens we are
back to the real world next week.

FT  09 APR 92 / Leading Article: Ice cold in Tokyo
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE JAPANESE government is showing remarkable outward calm in the face of
relentlessly declining stock market and property values. It sees no problem,
except for the banks; markets go down as well as up. 'The Japanese
government does not seek any quick fixes now,' said finance minister Tsutomu
Hata on Wednesday. 'Please ask the stock market about the market.'
It is hard to be at all sure how far this inactivity represents cool heads
or cold feet. The so-called bubble economy may appear to be well deflated,
but long-term investors are still sitting on handsome profits, and a quick
rebound could readily get out of hand. The London equity market, after all,
doubled in six weeks from its post-bubble low in 1975, which may help to
account for the failure of too many British financiers to learn any lasting
lessons from that episode.
There is a domestic case, then, for continuing to allow the Japanese market
to seek its own salvation. Unhappily it is also true that a party devastated
by financial scandals is very ill-placed to do anything other than twiddle
its thumbs. That is why more than the usual burden of responsibility falls
on Mr Yasushi Mieno, the central bank governor.
The main impact of the market collapse has been on the banks, now facing
capital shortage. The real economy will be further slowed, but not
necessarily thrown into recession by their problems. As in the US, many of
the banks' clients now have higher credit ratings than the banks themselves,
and are disintermediating into the commercial paper market.
It is the emergent Japanese yuppie class which will be most incommoded; the
moral reformers among those in authority, notably the severe Mr Mieno, may
regard this as an advantage. The banks may still be able to cater for the
small company sector as the bigger borrowers turn elsewhere.
However, there is a clear danger that a severe correction could turn into
something worse; the low turnover during some of the heaviest recent falls
shows only how few people are yet prepared to regard cheap shares as
bargains. Above all, Tokyo is now far too large a figure in world markets to
be run as a purely domestic concern.
For the time being, there is little sign of any harmful repercussions: it is
likely that Japanese investors outside the banking system - notably the huge
insurance companies - are every bit as anxious to increase their overseas
weighting as the banks can be to realise some of their more liquid assets.
The restructuring of the Japanese market, notably the unwinding of
cross-holdings, is healthy, but only now beginning.
No cause for panic yet, then; but to insure against future alarums, the
Tokyo authorities should perhaps make it clearer that they are serious about
stimulating the real economy, and that in the last resort, they will stand
behind the integrity of the banks - whatever may happen to their
shareholders.

However cynical about politicians we may have become in recent weeks, many
of us will watch every moment of polling night itself, not least because
this count looks like being the closest for a long time. You simply have to
decide whether to go for Jon Snow (cousin of Peter, from the Newsnight
sandpit) anchoring for ITN, or David Dimbleby (scion of an even older
broadcasting dynasty) doing the same for BBC1, or whether, like many of us,
you will flick between the two. If you want to know the results but feel the
whole business is overdone, here is the drill: switch to BBC1 at 9.55 and
then toggle between Dimbleby and Snow for the first exit poll.
As soon as possible after 10.00 switch to C4 and watch Scandal, a goodish
British film about politics in what feels like another age: the Profumo
scandal. At 12.10 check what has happened in the first hour of results and
then watch either Manhattan, one of Woody Allen's best movies, on BBC2
(12.15) or Kit And The Widow, the Flanders and Swan de nos jours, on C4
(12.10) followed by Duck Soup, arguably the Marx Brothers' best. That will
bring you to about 2.00 am by which time most of the results will be in.

HOOK (U) Odeon Leicester Square
THE DOCTOR (12) Odeon West End, MGM Chelsea
AT PLAY IN THE FIELDS OF THE LORD (15) Plaza, MGM Trocadero
KIUCHI ICA
Please pass the plate around. Today's collection is for the 'Save The
Yuppie' fund. Yes, brethren, I know you are probably thinking: Why save the
yuppie? After all, they were a menace to enlightened society in the 1980s,
with their portable telephones and dreams of eternal upward mobility. But
brethren - and sistren - we are talking of saving the yuppie from himself.
And so we come to Steven Spielberg's Hook. Peter Banning (Robin Williams) is
a stressed executive who flies to London with his family to stay with his
grandmother-in-law, the 'real' 92-year-old Wendy Darling (Maggie Smith).
When not shouting Dollars 5m deals down his cordless instrument, he listens
to the old dear recall how she and her siblings inspired Mr JM Barrie next
door. Ah, their tales of Peter Pan, the boy who never grew up] Ah, the
antics of their fantasy villain Captain Hook]
But hold on, here comes Hook himself (Dustin Hoffman) and his henchpersons,
borne into town on a supernatural hurricane. Good heavens, he is snatching
away Banning's bairns and transporting them to Never-Never Land. Can Banning
heed the squawkings of Grandma Wendy and take that leap of faith that will
turn him into a flying child like PP himself? Can he rescue the tots?
He can. But it takes two-and-a-half hours and the price for filmgoers is a
mawkish paean to infantile regression from a director who after a promising
early career - Jaws, Close Encounters Of The Third Kind, ET - has now been
mugged by Central Typecasting and persuaded to become the Peter Pan of
Greater Hollywood.
What dismays us about Hook is not so much the hook itself: the plot premise
about an overgrown yuppie 'finding himself' by becoming a child again. It is
the way we are attacked with that and other hooks long after they have
theoretically hooked us. Every scene mauls us with its overstatement.
Spielberg's London is a rapist Disneyland, pinioning our imaginations with
its sickly painted Big Bens and winsome snow-flurries. Spielberg's
Never-Never Land is a riot of overdone tweeness with its wacky galleons,
kitschy jungles and half-dozen moons. And the Lost Boys are a group of
multi-ethnic street urchins whose racial representativeness loudhails
Political Correctness at us.
Only Julia Roberts as a slinky, husky Tinkerbell reminds us there is a
naughty grown-up world out there somewhere. In all other respects, I loathed
this film. It represents the worst that Hollywood can now do to us: the
in-your-face lectures about the sanctity of childhood; the a la mode
political attitudinising; the drippy waste of Robin Williams, who used to
make a healthy living from standing at a microphone and deriding the pious
values here enshrined; and the turning of Dustin Hoffman (with Mr Hoffman's
help) into a witless English-accented fop - Terry-Thomas out of Lionel
Jeffries - as unmenacing as he is unfunny.
Some things at least in the film are too ludicrous to loathe. The press-show
audience freely guffawed at two early shots in which a baseball game
spectator wields a Sony video-camera, the maker's name emblazoned on the
strap. Sony, in case you forgot, now owns Tri-Star Pictures which made Hook.
This technique is called product placement. If Sony requires any advice on
where to place their products - for example, this film - I shall be only too
happy to help.
* Save The Yuppie Part 2: The Doctor. This is the tale of Dr William Hurt, a
successful but callous surgeon who sings and cracks jokes as he fishes about
in your aorta. As Dr Hurt might quip, he aorta know better. And by the end
of this spiritually improving drama directed by Randa Haines (Children Of A
Lesser God) and written by Robert Caswell from a book based on his own
experiences by Dr Ed Rosenbaum, Dr Hurt has come to know better.
For he gets a tumour on his larynx and is soon in a 'Physician, heal
thyself' situation. Can he trust his fellow MDs? Will his marriage (to
Christine Lahti) fall apart under the strain? Will he fall for hairless but
still beautiful chemotherapy patient Elizabeth Perkins?
We have never seen so much fuss about a life-or-death operation. We know
where we are being led: along the hospital corridor floor following the
coloured stripe with matching wall-signs that read 'Radiation, barium enemas
and de-yuppification.' Problem is: Hurt is good at the yuppie part, the
high-flying scalpel-wielder more concerned with the insides of his wallet
than those of his patient. But he is hopeless at the humane transformation
presumed to follow on the dose he receives of his own medicine. * Yuppie
redemption, we note with relief, is nowhere in sight in At Play In The
Fields Of The Lord. The acquisitive instincts here are the age-old ones of
land- and soul-grabbing. Deep in the Amazon jungle, a Brazilian commandante,
hungry for rainforests, wants to bomb the local Niaruna Indians from their
villages. But two rival white missionaries (John Lithgow, Aidan Quinn) want
to keep them in place as sitting targets for Christianisation.
Meanwhile their wives, Daryl Hannah (beautiful and liberated) and Kathy
Bates (repressed frump) add tension to the imperfect Eden. And a local air
pilot with Cherokee blood (Tom Berenger) drops from the sky to befriend the
Indians against both church and state.
Peter Mathiessen wrote the novel, though as directed and co-scripted by
Hector Babenco (Pixote, Kiss Of The Spider Woman) it plays more like James
A. Michener with a twist of Maugham. The scenery has you gasping. Rivers
sinuous and gleaming as anacondas twine through dense jungle; star-high
mountains wreathe themselves in mist or spill measureless waterfalls.
Whenever it peers down from God's viewpoint, the film looks its Dollars 34m;
whenever it peers up from the Indians' viewpoint - directed with real verve
and conviction - it looks its six-month schedule preceded by three months of
training and rehearsal for the non-whites.
If only the white actors had been allotted the same. Their characters are
from Cardboard City and they know it. Assembled from old packing material,
they creak their way through the God-fearing tirades, the blackwater fever
bereavements (Aidan and Katy lose little Billy), the sudden mad scenes (Miss
Bates), the let's-go-native binges (Berenger) and of course the
back-to-nature nude river bathing (Hannah). 'I realised it was important to
the story and not the least exploitative' says Miss Hannah of this scene.
Yes, well . . .
The film lasts three hours and six minutes and is not, I admit, boring. But
I kept wishing Werner Herzog had been parachuted into the director's chair
to lend a little true madness, a little searing obliquity of vision. In
Babenco's hands, the story's final disenchantments - the Indians lose faith
in men and Gods, the whites in the virtues of the missionary position - are
as thudding and predictable as quarterly bills landing on your doormat.
Finally, a small but perfectly formed treat: Kenchi Iwamoto's Kikuchi. A
surreal chamber drama from Japan, is shot in a bluish glow, it tells of a
lonely, maladjusted youth (Jiro Yoshimura) who works in a basement laundry
by day and lives a Peeping Tom existence by night. As deadpan as a Keaton
comedy, as richly weird as an early David Lynch film.

FT  09 APR 92 / Business Law: Streamlining agreed offers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD GREENE and DANIEL BRAVERMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The agreed bid by Blockbuster Entertainment Corporation for City-vision plc,
which went unconditional on January 22 1992, was a breakthrough in
cross-border acquisitions involving US and UK companies.
For the first time, a US company was permitted by the US Securities and
Exchange Commission (SEC) to offer its shares to the US shareholders of a UK
target on the basis of a UK-style offer document, supplemented with the most
important information required by SEC rules.
Complex legal and commercial issues arise when a US company wishes to offer
its shares in exchange for those of a UK company.
On the UK side, two requirements impose significant constraints on the
conduct of the offer. First, if the acquirer wishes to make use of the
streamlined procedures of section 428 of the Companies Act 1985 in order to
squeeze out any minority shareholders remaining after the offer is
completed, the same consideration must be offered to all, not
differentiating between US and UK shareholders.
Second, the formal offer document must be mailed not more than 28 days after
the offer is announced, and, under both US and UK disclosure rules, the
timing of the announcement itself depends on when an agreement to proceed
with the offer is reached.
On the US side, the most important constraint is imposed by the requirement
that a registration statement be filed and declared effective by the SEC
before the formal offer document is mailed.
SEC rules require that, if the acquisition is material, (as defined by rules
measuring financial impact) the bidder's registration statement must contain
audited financial statements of the target company, including balance sheets
for its two most recent financial years, income statements for the three
most recent years and corresponding cash-flow statements (which differ from
UK-style source and application of funds statements).
In addition, certain audited financial information - the main balance sheet
and income statement items - must be provided for the target's five most
recent financial years.
While the financial statements and information may be presented on the basis
of UK Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), audited numerical
reconciliations to US GAAP of the principal balance sheet and income
statement item must be provided for each of the five years for which
information is given. Moreover, pro forma financial information showing the
accounting effect of the combination must be provided for the most recent 12
months.
The target's management must provide a detailed discussion and analysis
(MD&amp;A) of the target's financial results and condition for at least the
three years covered by the audited financial statements.
In the Blockbuster/Cityvision offer it was essential that Blockbuster should
be able to use the streamlined squeeze-out procedures provided by the
Companies Act. Blockbuster was advised that this would be permitted, in an
offer that included both a cash and a share alternative, only if both were
made available to City-vision's UK and US shareholders, the latter
representing about 8 per cent of the total when the offer was announced on
November 22 1991.
Since a share alternative was desirable as a business matter, the US
registration requirements had to be confronted. A private placement of
Blockbuster shares to Cityvision's US shareholders could have been made
pursuant to an exemption from the registration requirements, but the
procedures and restrictions that such a placement would entail were not
practicable given the size and quality of Cityvision's US shareholder base.
The offer and sale might also have been made entirely outside the US,
pursuant to the exemption from the registration requirements provided by
Regulation S. However, since Blockbuster shares were listed only on the New
York Stock Exchange, the risk of immediate 'flow-back' of the shares into
the US was too great for Blockbuster prudently to rely on that exemption.
Indeed, this concern would have required a 'flow-back' registration
statement to be filed and declared effective by the time the offer went
unconditional even if Cityvision had no US shareholders or if its US
shareholders had been offered shares in an exempt private placement, or
cashed out.
As a result, either the offer had to be registered with the SEC or the share
alternative for both US and UK shareholders had to be abandoned. And since
an agreement had been reached to proceed with the offer, and the offer had
been announced, before detailed discussions could be held with the staff of
the SEC, there were only 28 days in which to resolve all the issues raised
by the requirement to register.
Cityvision's financial statements and other information required by the
SEC's rules could not be prepared in time either to register the initial
offering in the US or, if Regulation S were to be relied on, to register the
flow-back in the US of Blockbuster shares initially offered and sold abroad.
In preliminary discussions, the SEC staff had said no relaxation of the
disclosure requirements would be contemplated in the context of an offer in
which US shareholders were not treated equally, but were cashed out. It was
then proposed to the staff that the offer be made to Cityvision's US
shareholders on the same basis as to its UK shareholders, provided that
disclosure requirements that could not be met before the formal offer
document had to be mailed under UK rules would be waived.
In making this proposal, it was emphasised to the SEC staff that the effect
of not granting the required waivers would be to eliminate the share
alternative, which was neither in the interest of Cityvision's US
shareholders nor a fair result for its UK shareholders given their
predominance.
The SEC staff agreed to permit the offer to proceed in the US even though
the registration statement did not meet some formal requirements: the
reconciliations to US GAAP of Cityvision's financial statements and
information were not audited, nor did they cover the full five-year period;
UK-style source and application of funds statements were provided instead of
cash-flow statements;
Cityvision's financial information for the year ended November 30 1991
consisted of estimated results rather than audited financial statements;
the MD&amp;A for Cityvision covered only the year ended November 30 1991 instead
of the full three-year period; and
Blockbuster presented pro forma financial information based on Cityvision's
estimated results.
In addition, the financial advisers to Blockbuster and Cityvision, Merrill
Lynch and Schroders, respectively, were not required to consent to the
references to them in the registration statement and thus did not face a
stricter standard of liability under US law than that which already applied
to them under English law.
Finally, the SEC staff agreed that the registration statement could consist
substantially of the UK offer document, the information required by US rules
being contained in additional appendices.
The flexibility shown by the SEC to the Blockbuster/City-vision offer is
evidence of the strength of its commitment to integrate the US capital
markets more fully with those of the rest of the world and to ensure its
rules do not unnecessarily deprive US investors of the benefits of owning
shares in foreign companies.
The adoption of Rule 144A and Regulation S in the Spring of 1990 were
significant steps in this direction, and in the summer of 1991 the SEC
proposed rules that would permit US holders of shares in foreign companies
to participate in rights offerings and exchange offers in certain
circumstances on the basis of foreign offer documents without regard to US
requirements (but subject nevertheless to US standards of liability).
Although these proposed rules have yet to be adopted, the policies
underlying them, and their thoughtful implementation by the SEC staff, made
the Blockbuster/Cityvision exchange offer possible.

FT  09 APR 92 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Putting your shirt
on power dressing / A look at the importance of style in politics
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
'THE first thing I noticed about Neil Kinnock . . . was the brilliant gleam
from his highly polished shoes . . .This gave one a clue to the fact that he
is, in fact, more self-disciplined and organised than might usually be
thought.'
Thus Brendan Bruce, former Conservative party communications director under
Margaret Thatcher, illustrates a paradox at the heart of marketing,
particularly the marketing of a political image.
The apparently trivial - the well-polished shoes - can be yoked into serving
a judgment of considerable importance - Kinnock's managerial and
administrative abilities. If Bruce's interpretation takes hold, then John
Major could well be looking for a new job tomorrow.
But that is a large 'if'. A moment's reflection indicates how shallow such a
judgment is; maybe all the Labour leader has done is to buy the marketing
notion that human beings can be duped by shiny shoes? Was Michael Foot's
sartorial inelegance really responsible for his failure to dislodge Margaret
Thatcher in 1983?
I suspect that Bruce, the archetypal marketing professional, doubts that
proposition. But his commitment to image-polishing (ex-Procter &amp; Gamble,
General Foods and Mars) ensures that frankness about the limitations of mass
persuasion has small showing in his entertaining book.*
Together, Britain's three main political parties will have spent more than
Pounds 30m on marketing techniques in an attempt to form the next
government. It has been an election largely waged by party backroom
activists who have uncritically gobbled up the magic of unsophisticated
marketing handbooks, firmly believing that image determines the outcome.
But as Bruce points out, image-polishing is a weapon with only supportive
value. The trouble is that in a neck-and-neck race, marketeers are tempted
to get bigger than their boots.
Thus as Labour and the Conservatives have chosen to slug it out on each
other's traditional territory - the one trying hard to prove its competence
to manage the economy, the other selling a newly-found adherence to the
welfare state - the internal recriminations are being laid at the door of
supposed failures by the 'communications directorates'.
This argument suggests that if only they had rubbed harder on the shoes of
their leaders, then victory might have been snapped from the jaws of defeat.
That is not an entirely ridiculous notion. Bruce says that 'the impact we
make on others depends on the following: how we look and behave - 55 per
cent; how we speak - 38 per cent; and what we say - only 7 per cent.'
But Bruce is more clever than that. He reminds us that marketing is a
necessary, but not sufficient, condition for persuading consumers, be they
of chocolate bars or election campaigns.
He thus castigates politicians for vainly hoping that, in a tight spot, lip
gloss can conceal a lack of substance. When old-fashioned ideas like
leadership, integrity, clarity of vision and principled policy-making have
apparently retreated in the face of image manipulators, surely he who
captures the cosmetic tendency will also capture power?
Facts dispute that belief. There is a view that Labour 'fought the best
campaign' in 1987, and Kinnock certainly had a 45 per cent popularity rating
against Thatcher's 41 per cent.
But much good that did Labour. So although there is little doubt that in
1992, Labour has again led the marketing slickness field, that may not be
enough to overcome suspicions that behind the face-paint is wrinkles.
All that image makers can do is to help the tide on its course. Bruce
recalls that Hitler, who 'had studied advertising techniques and concluded
that consistency and perseverance were the twin secrets of success', made
full use of a wide range of techniques.
Long before the current campaign, Hitler employed stooge audiences, warm-up
men, snappy logos, media manipulation, even direct mail - posting tiny
gramophone records of his speeches to supporters. Today's image massagers
resort to many of the same tactics.
But hyper-inflation and a febrile state structure gave room for Hitler's
marketing techniques. Marketing can only ripen; it cannot germinate.
Bruce is thus led to some robust conclusions, which future political leaders
might well bear in mind:
No amount of talent or hype can convince the voter that a sow's ear is
anything but that.
A popular and respected leader in charge of an unpopular party will usually
lose.
An unpopular leader in charge of a popular party will probably win.
No political image maker can afford to ignore the leader's personality but
if that is at the expense of communicating the benefits of policy, then it
is always wrong.
Those who mistake 'production values' for content are destined for a shock
at the polls. Voters make a choice based on the credibility of promises, not
on the track record of film directors.
On those premises the current race must still be wide open.

FT  09 APR 92 / Technology: Japanese digger holed up in UK
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Deep in the Northumberland hills earlier this winter a delivery driver
complained bitterly to the manager of a quarry about the rough treatment
meted out to a mysterious wheeled excavator.
The excavator, whose identifying marks had all been removed for testing, had
been manufactured down the road at Komatsu UK (KUK) in Birtley. Its abuse
was in a good cause, marking the end of an intensive two-year exercise in
technology transfer that had produced the first Japanese construction
equipment model to have been designed, engineered and built outside Japan.
'For our lads, it's the first exposure to this kind of activity,' says Mick
Higgs, KUK's design manager.
The project is the culmination of a steady development in KUK's design
expertise since the plant began production in 1987. For Clive Morton, KUK's
first employee and now director of personnel and administration, it has
illustrated an essential point about technology transfer - it is hard work.
'It sounds all very grand,' he says. 'But really it's all about day-to-day
effort and concentrating on making things work. It's not somebody wafting
in, throwing concepts on the table and wafting out again.'
Komatsu had always intended that Birtley would progressively become an
autonomous European plant. From the beginning it had a small design team,
adapting Komatsu's machines to different requirements and regulations in 16
national European markets and also ensuring 'buildability'.
Here, says Morton, KUK went through some elementary lessons about differing
approaches in Japanese and UK drawing offices. The Japanese tendency was to
leave as much information on a drawing as possible, including all the design
changes, whereas the UK approach was to throw away discarded versions and
concentrate on the final one.
The next stage involved KUK's designers in Komatsu's Dash 5 model programme,
with the Birtley team influencing the design at an early stage to ensure it
would not hit problems in Europe. A Finnish distributor, for example,
complained that the grab handles on the door were too small for drivers
wearing thick gloves to grip.
The latest stage involves designing an entire machine that is aimed
particularly at a gap in the European market and its biggest constituent
part, Germany.
It has been a testing experience for both the parent company and the KUK
design team, now expanded from an original 10 to 40 and linked to eight
plants in Japan via a Pounds 1m Cad system.
For Komatsu, maintaining its reputation has been paramount, says Toshitaka
Suketomo, KUK managing director, and the Birtley development team has
followed the same procedure that the parent company uses.
The process differs from western approaches by delaying the crucial decision
to build or not to build until completion of a sequence of approvals to move
from one stage to the next.
The advantage, says Morton, is that it helps isolate a problem that ought to
be fixed before the production decision is taken. On the other hand, some of
the UK employees - keen to know whether their designs would ever become
reality - found the idea difficult to accept.
Inevitably the team made mistakes, but were in close touch with Japan for
guidance and also with Japanese colleagues seconded to the project. This is
one reason, says Higgs, why the team is keen to have another go.
Already, design work is continuing on a smaller (13 tonne) and larger (20
tonne) version of the new PW170-5 machine, although KUK will not say when
they will be launched.
The original 17-tonne machine, smartened up and its identity restored, was
unveiled this week at the Bauma construction equipment exhibition in Munich.
Both Morton and Suketomo are keeping their feet on the ground about the
process but two years from start to finish is a creditable debut.

FT  09 APR 92 / Technology: A shock to the system / A look at how
privatisation has affected the R&amp;D activities of Britain's electricity
industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SPENDING on research and development has been one casualty of electricity
privatisation in the UK. The new companies have closed laboratories
inherited from the Central Electricity Generating Board, made many
scientists and engineers redundant and reduced the scope of their R&amp;D.
The size of the decline is uncertain, since the privatised R&amp;D arrangements
are not yet fully in place and the companies have been slow to disclose
their new levels of research spending.
In evidence for last month's Commons Energy Committee report on electricity
privatisation, the Watt Committee on Energy, an independent group, estimated
that National Power, PowerGen, National Grid and Nuclear Electric spend less
than Pounds 100m a year between them on R&amp;D. That compares with the CEGB's
R&amp;D budget of Pounds 200m in 1988-89, the last year before it was broken up.
As the Watt Committee commented: 'For a high-technology industry with sales
exceeding Pounds 5bn per annum and facing both supply and market
developments together with a degree of uncertainty in the medium- to
long-term future, a total spend of . . . less than 2 per cent of sales seems
anomalous.'
Most hostility has come from bodies representing the R&amp;D staff hit by the
cuts. Patrick Hanson, national research officer of the Electrical Power
Engineers' Association, said the energy secretary in the government elected
today should use powers under the Electricity Act to fund research in the
national interest which had been abandoned by the privatised industry.
However John Wakeham, the outgoing energy secretary, said that, while it was
too early to be certain, 'the run-down by the old CEGB research
establishments is probably being compensated for in a pretty efficient way
by manufacturers of products and users of products seeking to do the
necessary research in order to assist themselves in the market'.
The privatised companies agree with him. 'In the long term, manufacturers,
suppliers and research institutions will be stimulated to fill the gap,'
predicted East Midlands Electricity. 'This will result in a healthier, more
competitive and more commercially focused R&amp;D activity.'
The new R&amp;D arrangements of the non-nuclear parts of the industry are:
National Power, the largest generating company, is closing its main
laboratories in Leatherhead, Surrey, where 200 scientists and 250 support
staff worked. It is setting up instead a streamlined research and technology
division at its business centre in Swindon, Wiltshire, with 100 scientists
and 20 support staff. R&amp;D spending will fall from Pounds 26m to Pounds 14m a
year.
PowerGen, its smaller competitor, has closed the Marchwood laboratories in
Hampshire and concentrated R&amp;D at its Ratcliffe Technology Centre near
Nottingham. The number of scientists employed has fallen from 190 to 40.
PowerGen's R&amp;D spending will fall from Pounds 14m to Pounds 8m a year. This
includes a payment of Dollars 3.3m a year to the Electric Power Research
Institute (EPRI) in the US.
National Grid, the transmission company, has set up a technology and science
division with 210 scientists and support staff in Leatherhead. In contrast
to National Power and PowerGen, its R&amp;D spending has gone up slightly - from
about Pounds 6m a year when transmission was something of a Cinderella
subject within the CEGB to Pounds 8.2m now.
The regional electricity companies, which distribute power to consumers,
support R&amp;D through EA Technology in Capenhurst, Cheshire. Collectively they
underwrite about Pounds 13m of EA Technology's Pounds 20m a year budget and
spend a further Pounds 4m on individual projects.
Peter Chester, who retires this month as National Power's executive director
for technology and environment after supervising the R&amp;D restructuring, says
this was a response to the profound shift in technical strategy which
accompanied privatisation. Instead of the planned expansion of large
coal-fired power stations designed by the CEGB, National Power is building
smaller gas-fired combined cycle plants designed by international power
engineering companies.
'One consequence is a much reduced call for 'research' in support of
existing plant; in future this will be supplied mainly from within the
engineering function,' said Chester.
National Power's slimmed-down R&amp;D staff will concentrate on: strategic
studies of new options for power generation such as 'clean coal' technology;
emission control techniques; cheaper fuels; waste-to-energy processes;
co-generation; wind power development; and other opportunities for business
development.
Critics have attacked National Power particularly for running down
environmental research, for which the Leatherhead laboratories had a
worldwide reputation. But Chester says this was inevitable. When the CEGB
set up its environmental science programme 15 years ago, 'major scientific
questions were still open, environmental research in the universities and
other institutions was relatively poorly supported and policy on reducing SO
and NOx was awaiting better scientific understanding. Now there are clear
policies, many other players in the field and much external environmental
expertise to draw on.'
National Power says it is making every effort to 'assist in the transfer of
those skills and facilities no longer needed, to organisations that can make
effective use of them'. According to Carlos Lopez-Cacicedo, research and
technology director, 90 per cent of those made redundant at Leatherhead have
found new jobs.
The company is giving away surplus equipment that would be worth several
million pounds if new. For example, Imperial College, London, has set up an
Atmospheric Chemistry Research Unit on the basis of mobile laboratories
donated by National Power. And the Natural Environment Research Council is
acquiring special greenhouses designed to assess the effect of pollutants on
plants.
As the generating companies slim down their own R&amp;D activities, they are
contracting out more research. The biggest beneficiary so far is EPRI, based
in California, which carries out collaborative R&amp;D for the US electric
utilities.
Last year PowerGen became EPRI's first overseas affiliate. Its Dollars 3.3m
a year subscription gives PowerGen access to a range of projects on which
EPRI is spending Dollars 46m a year. EPRI has just opened a UK office in
anticipation of receiving more work from the electricity supply industry in
Britain and other European countries.
In the UK two electricity R&amp;D organisations with similar names, ERA
Technology and EA Technology, stand to benefit from any further contracting
out of research. ERA Technology in Leatherhead (originally the Electrical
Research Association) has been operating as a free-standing contract R&amp;D
company since 1973, covering electro-technical research. EA Technology
(formerly the Electricity Research and Development Centre) still depends on
underwritten funding from the electricity companies but is moving to find
new customers.
At the same time Stuart Excell, managing director of EA Technology, suggests
that the industry's regulator, Stephen Littlechild, should give the
electricity companies more incentive to support R&amp;D - especially research
into more efficient use of electricity - by allowing them to pass on the
costs in increased charges to customers. 'Otherwise it's like asking a
company to spend money reducing its own turnover,' he says.

FT  09 APR 92 / Management: Brewers move ahead in Tokyo
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL WEINBERG
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When Dirk Enters began marketing Heineken beer in Japan 15 years ago,
foreign labels were an exotic oddity. After years of alliance-building and
gradual expansion, overseas brewers are getting an intoxicating taste of
what may lie ahead.
Each of the four imported beers established in Japan has tied up with one of
the big four domestic brewers. Of the American groups, Budweiser has linked
with Suntory, Coors with Asahi and Miller with Sapporo, while Heineken of
the Netherlands has been working with Kirin.
In the past four years, both imports and foreign beers brewed under licence
locally have increased their share of a growing market, although they still
have only 2.3 per cent, compared with about 5 per cent held by imports in
other beer drinking countries.
'This is an immature beer market,' says Heineken's Enters. He notes that
while consumers are inundated with new labels and advertising campaigns,
Japan lacks Europe's variety of large and private labels and price
competition.
The US competitors appear to be setting their sights particularly high, with
their pricing and marketing strategies aimed at the mass market. Only
Heineken is sticking to the premium segment.
Budweiser, the world's best-selling beer, is already Japan's top import
label - its distinctive all-American label and fun-loving sales pitch seems
to appeal to image-conscious young adults.
While beer may appear a popular tipple at Japanese social occasions, per
capita consumption remains less than half the average in many European
nations. Cultural factors are one reason, with sake and shochu highly
popular. But so too is the heady cost, given the lack of price competition
and the higher tax on beer than on other alcoholic drinks.
Whether foreign brewers proceed alone or with partners who have mixed
feelings about their success, they will have to expand sales in bars,
restaurants and discos, which still account for most of their turnover. They
must also grab more shelf space in liquor shops and the growing ranks of
supermarkets and convenience stores being permitted to sell beer.
The tight reins that tax collectors and local brewers have held on pricing
for decades are being loosened. Last year Japan's Fair Trade Commission
launched an investigation into price-fixing by the big domestic brewers. It
concluded no illegal activity had occurred, but urged brewers to run ads
telling retailers that their published prices were recommendations only.
The small family-run liquor shops that still dominate the retail trade
remain reluctant to discount local brands, although large retailers
regularly cut prices for foreign labels.
The Japanese palate seems sensitive to price.
Budweiser sales soared 80 per cent in the first half of 1990 when local
brewers increased their prices. The Americans' production cost advantage has
helped them narrow the gap.
Foreign brewers have one other trump card: as the beer industry becomes a
global business, Japanese brewers are keen to develop their own export
markets. To do so, they will need close industry allies abroad.

FT  09 APR 92 / Losses at Lloyd's analysed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EXTERNAL Names at Lloyd's of London stand to lose a larger proportion of
their assets than Names who work full-time in the market, according to a new
analysis of the Lloyd's losses for 1989.
Warnings of losses have brought the appointment of Sir David Walker to
investigate in what circumstances Names working at Lloyd's may have been
placed on more profitable syndicates than those to which outside Names were
allocated.
The assets of Names underwrite insurance business.
In a letter published in the Financial Times today, Mr Richard Spooner, an
external Name who estimates he will lose Pounds 150,000 for the 1989
underwriting year, says working Names are expected to lose 12 per cent of
the assets they pledged, compared with 16.5 per cent for external Names.
His figures are based on forecasts by the managing agents of Lloyd's
syndicates and released over the last few weeks. They include estimates of
losses for the 4 per cent of agents who did not provide forecasts and are
provisional.
Mr Julian Crispin, chairman of Sedgwick Underwriting Agents, stressed that
external names had fared better than working names in profitable years such
as 1986 and 1987.
Lloyd's said: 'You can prove anything with figures if you have enough of
them. There is not a lot we can add until the Walker inquiry reports in late
May.'

unofficial quota system that restricted the number of women detectives.
DC Court, who has been an officer for 17 years, finally became a detective

FT  09 APR 92 / Charity's links with Natural Law party probed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CHARITY Commission has launched a preliminary investigation into the
activities of a UK-based charity because of its connections to a newly
founded political party that has been actively campaigning for votes in
today's general election.
It emerged yesterday that the commission has approached the registered
charity the World Government for the Age of Enlightenment of Great Britain
for information about its links with the Natural Law party, which is
fielding 310 candidates.
The commission is trying to establish whether the charity may be in breach
of regulations by straying too far into the field of political activity.
Officials for the commission say the decision to conduct a preliminary
investigation was made after the publication of advertisements in the
national media and 'representations' from unnamed members of the public.
They focus on full-page advertisements placed on separate days by the
charity and by the Natural Law party.
The charity is the local branch of a worldwide organisation focused on the
teachings of the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, which has its headquarters at
Vlodrop in the Netherlands.
Funding for the Natural Law party advertisement came from the Association of
the International World Plan Executive Council (AIWC), also based in the
Netherlands, which is part of the Maharishi's international organisation.
Mr Peter Warburton, a spokesman for the Natural Law party, said that many of
the candidates of the party had practised the Transcendental Meditation
programme founded by the Maharishi, but denied that the campaign was funded
by the charity.
He said that the NLP had paid for its advertisment with a loan from the AIWC
and that the money 'will be repaid'.
He described the AIWC as an international foundation set up to help to fund
natural law projects around the world. The party had also received financial
support at a national level from 'well-wishers who do not want their names
revealed'.
The NLP says it has spent Pounds 1m on its campaign since officially
launching itself soon after the campaign started.
The candidates for the NLP include Mr Leslie Davis and Mr Roger Chalmers,
two doctors who were struck off the register last October after being found
guilty of serious professional misconduct by the General Medical Council.

FT  09 APR 92 / Chemical sector spending falls 13%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CAPITAL expenditure by the chemical industry, which is suffering in the
recession, fell 13 per cent in 1991 and will fall a further 10 per cent this
year.
The fall in 1992 spending, predicted today by the Chemical Industry
Association, is in spite of record sums being spent by the chemicals sector
on environmental protection, and substantial amounts invested by the
pharmaceuticals groups on research and development.
The association warned that 1992 was going to be another tough year for the
UK's chemical industry. Since January, little had happened to improve
prospects of an economic recovery either internation-ally or domestically,
it said.
Moreover, high levels of debt, shortage of capital and the likelihood of
continuing high levels of interest rates would mean that the projected
recovery would be much slower than that after the recession between 1980 and
1981.
The industry's present three-year investment programme of Pounds 5.4bn was
down by 22 per cent in real terms compared with the period between 1989 and
1991. The present programme was the lowest since the period between 1984 and
1986, although it was higher than between 1981 and 1983, the association
said.
Capital spending on plant, machinery, vehicles and buildings would fall to
Pounds 1.7bn this year from Pounds 1.8bn in 1991, it said. A small increase
to Pounds 1.8bn is expected in 1993.

FT  09 APR 92 / Election 1992: Stubborn polls deny a breakthrough
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FROM SHADOW Budgets to soapboxes, spectacular rallies to lavish political
broadcasts, the leading parties have tried everything they know. But opinion
polls, for the most part, have been stubbornly unmoved through four weeks of
intensive campaigning.
Labour has consolidated and arguably widened the narrow lead it held when Mr
John Major named the day from the steps of Downing Street on March 11. But
neither of the leading parties has sustained anything resembling a decisive
breakthrough.
If there has been a pronounced trend, it has favoured the Liberal Democrats,
whose support has climbed to a 19-20 per cent plateau from 15-16 per cent a
month ago.
This improvement seemed to stem from the 'war of Jennifer's ear', when their
two rivals became embroiled in an unseemly slanging match in the wake of a
controversial Labour broadcast on health on March 24.
As his opponents argued, Mr Paddy Ashdown, Liberal Democrat leader, made a
dignified bid for the moral high ground.
There was one day when Labour thought it had made a breakthrough: Tuesday,
March 31, when three polls put the party ahead of the Tories by between four
and seven points.
More recent polls have, however, resumed the less decisive pattern evident
early in the campaign, averaging out at a Labour lead of between two and
three points.
Though the Tories have not regained the 39 per cent support level around
which they oscillated for the first two weeks of the campaign, Labour
support has appeared to seep away to the Liberal Democrats in almost equal
measure, leaving the gap between the two leading parties little changed.

FT  09 APR 92 / Election 1992: Balancing act may not be so precarious
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE COMPLEXITIES of the hung parliament Britain may wake up to tomorrow have
been greatly exaggerated.
The leader of the largest party will take office and present parliament with
a Queen's Speech on May 6. If the speech is voted down, he will resign and
the leader of the next biggest party will be summoned by the Queen.
Otherwise, the government will stay in power until it is defeated on a
motion of no confidence or the prime minister calls another election.
A government does not require support from a majority of MPs - it simply
needs to avoid being voted down on the Queen's Speech or a confidence
motion. Also a sitting prime minister may remain in office even if he or she
is not leader of the largest party.
Mr Edward Heath did so when the February 1974 election put him four seats
behind Labour. Mr Heath offered the Liberals a coalition and resigned only
after Liberal leader Mr Jeremy Thorpe refused him. Mr Harold Wilson formed a
government and the Tories abstained on his Queen's Speech. He called another
election seven months later, having sought no agreement with the Liberals.
Three things are clear. Mr Major would find it well-nigh impossible to
survive unless the Tories were the largest party; no-one need negotiate with
the Liberal Democrats in a hung parliament; and the Queen would almost
certainly grant a request for another election, provided the leaders of both
main parties had had the opportunity to form a government.
If the Conservatives are by some margin the largest party, Mr Major would
probably remain in Downing Street with tacit Ulster Unionist support.
If the Tory lead over Labour is small, the position is highly uncertain. On
precedent, Mr Major would present a Queen's Speech to parliament. Given the
likely voting intentions of the Ulster Unionists (anti-Labour) and the Welsh
and Scottish nationalists (anti-Tory), Mr Ashdown could hold the key to Tory
survival.
Internal party pressure would make it difficult for the Liberal Democrats to
sustain Mr Major, even by abstaining. But their threat to do so might be
enough to push Mr Kinnock some way on electoral reform.
Under these circumstances, an early election would be almost unavoidable,
since no Majority coalition - or even agreement - would be conceivable.
Short of a Tory volte-face on Scotland, PR or Ulster, none of the smaller
parties would formally ally with Mr Major while a Kinnock government would
very likely require consistent support from Liberals and nationalists simply
to outvote the Tories plus Unionists.
If Labour is the largest party, Mr Major would be likely to resign
immediately. Mr Kinnock would take office and present a Queen's Speech.
Were Labour defeated on that speech, an immediate second election is the
only plausible sequel.
But two back-to-back elections are without precedent in any western
democracy, and the pressure to avoid a poll in June would be intense. A
sufficient number of minor-party MPs - and perhaps even the Conservatives -
could be expected to abstain to avoid an election before the autumn.
On past form, an early second election would be inevitable if Labour led in
a hung parliament. But there are strong incentives for Labour and/or its
potential allies to avoid an early return to the hustings.
Neither Labour nor the Liberal Democrats would wish to face Scottish voters
again without a Scottish parliament on the statute book.
Whoever governs next week will be anxious to avoid the electorate until the
'green shoots' of recovery prove more substantial.
In July, Britain succeeds Portugal as European Community president for six
months - culminating in the Edinburgh summit in December.
Labour and the Liberal Democrats thus have a powerful mutual interest in
avoiding an early second election. The differences separating them are tiny
 -except on electoral reform for Westminster.
If the election produces a Labour-led hung parliament, ignore this week's
rhetoric and remember Rab Butler's dictum: politics is the art of the
possible.

BROADCASTERS are applying wise old heads and new technology to the most
comprehensive coverage of the results of a general election.
ITN's coverage through the night will feature Sir Robin Day. Back with the
ITN election team for the first time in more than 30 years, he will
interview senior politicians and pundits in the studio.
ITN has also found a use for the vast atrium in its new London headquarters.
It will be transformed into a life-size electronically generated House of
Commons. John Suchet will walk among political mirages. As the results come
in, ghostly figures in red, blue or yellow will change sides.
At the BBC Peter Snow, handling his eighth election, supported by political
editor John Cole who covered his first election in 1945, will preside over
the return of the Swingometer.
This 16 ft neon-lit pendulum is a long way from the 5 ft wooden version last
seen during the 1979 campaign.
As Peter Snow moves the pendulum across the scale, percentage point by
percentage point, computers will change target seats from blue to red or
vice versa to give what the BBC describes as 'an instant and
clearer-than-ever understanding of the election night battle for power'.
A separate battleground graphic will tell the Liberal Democrat story.
Peter Sissons, who succeeded Sir Robin as presenter of Question Time, will
take over Sir Robin's election night mantle, interviewing politicians and
guests in the studio.
Behind main BBC presenter David Dimbleby, in a refurbished 10,800 sq ft
studio, will be a 20 ft by 16 ft projector screen able to carry simultaneous
pictures from four outside broadcasts - BBC cameras will be at 85 locations.
After a three-and-a-half-hour break for Breakfast News, David Dimbleby will
be back on air until 5.30pm.
As befits devolutionary times, Scottish viewers will be able to choose the
full UK story on BBC1 or their own programme on BBC2.
The BBC's main Election 92 programme is being transmitted live throughout
the night on BBC World Service Television's Asian and European satellite
services and will be available to millions of viewers from China to
Czechoslovakia.
BBC World Service radio will run an election special for five hours
beginning at 2200 GMT.
ITN, which is spending Pounds 2m on its programme, will use 1,000 staff and
freelance journalists to try to be first with the results. It claims it was
first in 450 of the 651 seats in 1987, and is trying to do better this time.
Election 92, which will have Jon Snow in the anchor chair following the
retirement of Sir Alastair Burnet, is believed to be the longest programme
ever broadcast on ITV without commercial breaks - it will run for more than
eight hours until TV-am begins at 6am. ITN's coverage will also be beamed to
the US.
Both ITN and the BBC will aim to reduce both the uncertainty and the
excitement by broadcasting results of exit polls, which tend to give a good
forecast of the likely outcome, early in the evening.
Sky News, for its first general election, will offer a 24-hour results
programme spearheaded by David Frost and Selina Scott.
A 1,000 sq ft screen in the studio will show the interior of the House of
Commons and an eight-screen video wall will display graphic interpretations
of how the voting has gone.
Channel 4 will live up to its reputation for providing a real alternative.
At 10pm it will show Scandal, the feature film about the Profumo affair.
Later it will move on to the real Marxists - the Marx brothers and Duck
Soup.

FT  09 APR 92 / Election 1992: ERM eases fear of Pounds devaluation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STERLING has steadied this week as investors have reasoned that, should
Labour form a government, it would be unlikely to devalue the pound from its
central rate in the exchange rate mechanism of DM2.95.
Entry into the ERM 18 months ago, fixing the pound within set limits linked
to the D-Mark, has reduced the opportunities for the pound to lose value as
nervous financial markets have contemplated Labour's lead in the polls.
The ERM link has removed a lingering Labour nightmare: that should it be
poised to take power, huge sums of money would flow out of Britain because
of investors' antagonism to a change of government.
For much of the 1980s, that nightmare was made more credible by the
globalisation of financial markets and the impact of telecommunications
technology, allowing millions of pounds to be switched between countries in
seconds.
When Labour was last in office in 1979, the potential to do this was limited
by exchange controls and less-advanced technology.
Last night in London, sterling closed at DM2.8425, unchanged on the day and
up from DM2.835 on Friday night.
Sterling's relative steadiness has been due to judgments by currency dealers
about what would happen should sterling approach its ERM floor at about
DM2.78.
Unless Labour chose to devalue, the Bank of England and other European
central banks would be forced, under the system's rules, to support the
pound. As a result, at a point close to the lower limit, the pound would
look undervalued, and would be bought by investors.
Mr John Shepperd, an economist at investment bank SG Warburg Securities,
said: 'The ERM has made politics less of a threat to the exchange rate.'
Mr Paul Chertkow, chief currency analyst at the London office of Citibank,
the US bank, said that few main players on currency markets appeared to
believe that Labour would devalue. He said that among the big banks and
institutions active in the market, 'there is little evidence that anyone is
ready to sell the pound'.

FT  09 APR 92 / Election 1992: Major keeps post-election options open
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A CONSERVATIVE opposition might not inevitably vote down a minority Labour
government's first legislative programme, Mr John Major hinted yesterday,
although he emphasised throughout the day that he was 'stone cold certain'
of a working majority.
On the last day of campaigning, he was drawn into discussion of what might
happen in a hung parliament, his emphasis notwithstanding that the question
was hypothetical.
Speaking on the BBC's Election Call phone-in, he responded to a question
from Mr Tony Halmos, a Liberal Democrat campaign worker, by saying: 'I would
study what was in the programme and what I thought was in the interests of
the country.'
He did not know what Labour would put in its programme, but 'if they put in
the policies that they have at present outlined, we would certainly vote
against that'.
At the final morning's press conference, where he was flanked by senior
cabinet colleagues, Mr Major said the party's evidence showed that the
Tories would get a clear majority.
Setting out the stark choice between the parties over a range of issues from
the economy and taxation to choice in housing and education, he added that
if it were not for the 'bruises' caused by the recession he did not doubt
that the Tories would have an increased majority.
He also rejected any idea that he might regret having embarked on the health
service reforms, which have been a focus for Labour claims of a 'two-tier'
health service.
The reforms were, he said, providing better health care for everyone, and he
predicted that by the time of the election after today's, the overwhelming
majority of people would be defending them.
Later, he highlighted the movement back towards support for the Tories over
recent days. 'I'm finding day after day that there is slippage back into our
column, back into our camp, back into our sort of Britain,' he said on the
steps of Dulwich Conservative Club.
'We have plans for the future of Britain that no other party can match,
prospects for the future that no other party can deliver, and ambitions for
the future that no other party can contemplate.'
In Lewisham, where the Tories hold two seats by small majorities, Mr Major
met again the man who signed him up for the Brixton Conservatives in the
early 1960s, and was involved with him in soapbox politics.
Mr Derek Stone, a builder from south London, said that he and Mr Major 'made
a big stand, which we used to speak on on Saturday afternoons'.

FT  09 APR 92 / Election 1992: Lib Dems hope for two votes in Solihull /
Hearing the final verdict of the Martins, the FT's family of floating voters
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR NEIL KINNOCK's final attempt to lure floating voters into the Labour net
has failed to reach the Martin family.
This evening, when Lyn, Tony and their first-time-voting son, Russell, walk
out into Keswick Road, Solihull, on their way to the polling station, the
Conservatives will be sure of one vote and the Liberal Democrats can count
on one - probably two.
The Martins have never taken an election as seriously as this one. 'We
started the campaign with an open mind,' said Tony. They have watched the
news, seen the party election broadcasts, grown weary of the debates on TV
and felt, latterly, that they were being side-tracked. 'Instead of getting
to grips with it (the issues), it's all about this PR,' complained Lyn.
She, like her mother, will vote Conservative. But not, it appears, with vast
enthusiasm. 'I think it's a case of 'better the devil you know',' she said.
'We've fared quite well under the Conservatives. There've been times with
the high mortgage rates when we've really struggled.' Then, as an
afterthought, 'but we struggled under Labour'.
Tony has been impressed with the way Mr Paddy Ashdown has handled the
Liberal Democrat campaign. He voted Labour in the 1970s, following his
parents who now have switched to the Liberal Democrats. For a spell in the
mid-1980s he was, somewhat reluctantly, a shop steward. That scarred his
thinking. 'If I thought Labour would get in, I'd vote Conservative. But if
it's going to be a hung parliament, I'm inclined to vote Liberal Democrat.'
Russell has not made up his mind. 'I've still got time. I want to let it go
right to the wire.' But he is edging towards the Liberal Democrats. The poll
tax has coloured his view of the Conservatives: 'It was a mistake and yet
they know it was a mistake. It's the one mistake that's forced me away from
them.'
Like his parents, Russell concedes that 'Mr Kinnock has brought a lot of
good things up'. But he draws back. 'The way, like, Kinnock avoids things. I
don't like people like that. I like people like Paddy Ashdown who hit things
on the head.' Still, he views the prospect of a Labour government with a
detached equanimity. 'If they do get in, I'd be ready to give him (Mr
Kinnock) a fair crack of the whip.'
Lyn and Tony are more fearful. The past dogs them. 'Labour is so
union-oriented. There'll be lots of strikes again,' said Lyn. Tony argued:
'I think with Labour they're manipulated a bit by the unions. It's just been
pushed to the background.' Labour's campaign has failed to break down this
resistance. 'Mr Kinnock just aggravates me,' confessed Lyn. Tony said: 'I
don't think I could trust him.'

FT  09 APR 92 / Election 1992: Kinnock stresses reconstruction
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR NEIL KINNOCK, Labour leader, last night made an eve-of-poll appeal to the
electorate to reject a 'Tory future of insecurity, rundown and division' and
to allow a Labour government to build a Britain capable of becoming a
'pacemaker in Europe'.
With hours to go before polling started, Mr Kinnock told a rally in Barry,
South Wales, that Britain wanted a government that pulled the country
together and pushed it to greater achievements.
He said the election would not be won as a result of three weeks'
campaigning but because of the government's long record of 'failure and
fracture'. The Tories could not escape a past of complacency about the state
of the economy and 'contempt for the very idea of society'.
The Labour leader said: 'The Tories cannot escape their own record. Tomorrow
they will not escape the verdict of the people. People want to be rid of
them.'
Mr Kinnock said his government would immediately begin the task of getting
Britain out of recession. The need for action to reconstruct its industries,
sciences and skills was urgent, with only eight months to go before the
nation was forced to compete in the world's biggest single market.
He highlighted Labour's programme for increased investment in education and
in the National Health Service, and said a priority for Labour would be the
building and repairing of homes so that families did not have to suffer 'the
misery and insecurity of bad housing, overcrowding and homelessness'.
Mr Kinnock accused the government of concentrating power in its hands and of
becoming 'frenzied with deregulation in standards of safety and probity'.
They had been hyperactive in cutting top tax rates and slicing bottom-rate
benefits. Their failure to build up the economy and invest in the nation's
future had been a matter of conviction and doctrine, a belief in leaving the
future to chance.
Mr Kinnock said that Labour pledged to 'make the break' with the Tory years
and to build industrial success and civilised standards. The task could not
be accomplished overnight, and he was not promising miracles. By the end of
this century he wanted Britain to celebrate the millennium with something
better than a big New Year's Eve party. He wanted to put Britain 'back in
the lead where it belonged'.

FT  09 APR 92 / Election 1992: Unions review party funding
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STATE FUNDING for political parties, promised in Labour's manifesto, would
loosen but not sever the ties between the party and the trade unions that
finance it, according to Labour and union officials.
The ties are under review, with both sides agreed that a more distant
relationship is in their mutual interest. State funding would be a financial
relief for the Labour-affiliated unions, which at present finance about half
Labour's running costs between elections and nearly all election spending.
Mr John Edmonds, leader of the GMB general union, believes his proposal for
scaling down the union block vote at Labour conference from 90 per cent to
50 per cent is likely to be accepted more quickly, probably within the next
three years, as a result of the prospect of state funding.
Labour officials argue that the 'political ballast' provided by the unions
at party conference, and in the electoral college that elects the party
leader, will continue to be required to counterbalance the unreliable
constituency parties.
One Labour official said: 'The relationship has always been about a lot more
than money, and our political links will stay for the medium term.'
The unions will increasingly shift their influence to constituency parties,
where they will hope to encourage more of their members to join the Labour
party. State funding would allow the unions to continue the trend of
concentrating a higher proportion of their spending on elections alone.
State funding might face considerable political and popular opposition, but
it is supported by the Liberal Democrats.
The main Labour-affiliated unions have to ballot their members in 1994 on
whether their political funds should be retained. Last time the unions won
those ballots with ease, partly based on the argument that without union
political funds the opposition would be starved of cash.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GROWING frustration with the deadlock that afflicts the US government has
driven another senator to announce that he will not seek re-election in
November.
Senator Tim Wirth of Colorado said yesterday he would retire from Congress,
where he has sat for 12 years in the House of Representatives and another
six in the Senate.
He said his decision was prompted by personal anger and frustration at the
stalemate between a president who he believed would not lead and a Congress
which he found to be stymied by short-term political manoeuvring.
Seven other senators will be leaving Congress after the November elections.
Some have been forced out - Senator Alan Dixon of Illinois was defeated in a
primary; Senators Alan Cranston of California and Brock Adams of Washington
faced attacks on their ethics.
But others, including the widely respected Senator Warren Rudman of New
Hampshire, have given up the struggle for the same reasons as those
mentioned by Mr Wirth.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE jury in the drug-trafficking conspiracy trial of the Panamanian former
leader, General Manuel Antonio Noriega, said yesterday it was deadlocked,
but the trial judge in Miami sent it back for more deliberations.
The jurors seem in disagreement about one of the fundamental aspects of the
case - whether or not Gen Noriega took bribes from the cocaine cartel in
Medelln, Colombia, in return for protection.
To prove this arrangement is central to the US government's case. Only if a
business link is found to exist can the general be found guilty of two
charges under the Racketeer-Influenced Corrupt Organisation laws, the most
serious of the 10 charges.
The jury had asked Judge William Hoeveler on Tuesday for transcripts of the
testimony of 10 prosecution witnesses who claimed personal knowledge of Gen
Noriega's arrangements with the cartel.

FT  09 APR 92 / Iraqi missiles 'are threat to Allies'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK NICHOLSON, Middle East Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN said yesterday that Iraq has moved anti-aircraft missiles into the
protected area of Iraq north of the 36th parallel which 'could pose a
threat' to US, British and French aircraft patrolling the area.
The move revives the possibility of an allied strike against Iraqi forces -
an option General Colin Powell, chairman of the US joint chiefs of staff,
pointedly refused to rule out in London yesterday after talks on the rising
tension in northern Iraq with Mr John Major, the UK prime minister.
Gen Powell said after the meeting that he would not 'speculate on what we
might or might not do with respect to the use of military action.' The US
state department was last night preparing a formal warning to Iraq over the
missiles.
Officials said the Soviet-made SAM-2 and SAM-3 missile batteries had been
moved within the last 10 days to Mosul, 32km north of the 36th parallel,
beyond which Britain and the US have ordered Iraq not to stage military
operations against the Kurds on pain of possible allied counter attack.
The movement of missiles follows reports of renewed attacks by Iraqi forces
on the southern fringe of Kurdish held areas in the north - including some
around Mosul and Arbil north of the 36th parallel - and signs of a build-up
of Iraqi armour in the north.
Iraqi opposition groups in London also claim that a 36,000-strong Iraqi
force last week launched a bloody three-day offensive, backed by helicopter
gunships, against Iraqi Shias hiding in the country's southern marshes.
These skirmishes and the deployment of anti-aircraft missiles, which could
provide cover for an attack on the Kurds, has intensified top level
consultations between Britain and the US on a possible punitive raid to
deter President Saddam Hussein from threatening the Kurds - or from testing
too far the resolve of the Gulf war allies in their undertaking to protect
them.
British officials said yesterday that Gen Powell had brought forward a
long-intended trip to meet Mr Major in view of the deteriorating security
position in Iraq. The two men gave no details about a possible response to
the missile deployment.
However, as a first step, Iraq is likely to be warned privately through its
mission at the UN in New York that it risks an allied attack.
The US, Britain and France patrol the area from the Incirlik airbase in
Turkey, where a limited strike force has been based since the Kurdish
uprising immediately after the Gulf war.

FT  09 APR 92 / Rafsanjani poised to defeat radical opposition: Careful
screening of candidates should leave him in control of parliament
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE RUN-UP to Iran's majlis (parliamentary) elections tomorrow has been
marked by acrimony and cries of foul play from opponents of President Ali
Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, who have threatened a boycott on more than one
occasion.
The elections have given Mr Rafsanjani the opportunity to break the backbone
of radicals in their last great stronghold, allowing him to press ahead with
measures designed to open up the country to foreign investment and trade.
All legislation must pass through the Islamic Republic's 270 seat chamber
and some has been held up by the radicals who favour state control of the
economy. They also oppose foreign loans and the prevailing open-door foreign
policy propounded by the pragmatists, who regard these measures as essential
to their own survival and to restoring the country's economy, devastated
after Iran's gruelling war against Iraq.
Although Mr Rafsanjani has been generally successful in pushing through
legislation, the radicals have used the chamber as a public platform to
broadcast opposition to his policies.
Iran's latest five-year development plan was held up for a year while the
radicals argued against a provision allowing borrowing abroad, while last
year they succeeded in impeaching Mr Rafsanjani's minster for health, Mr
Iraj Fazel.
Iran has no formal political parties; instead voters choose from a list of
candidates every four years. This year, controversy has centred on the
screening process for prospective candidates. Some 1,100 candidates were
disqualified from standing from an original list of just over 3,150.
The vetting procedure was undertaken by the conservative Council of
Guardians, a 12-man body of clerics and legal experts, whose main function
is to check that laws passed by the majlis are in accordance with Islamic
law.
Mr Mehdi Karrubi, the radical majlis speaker, saw the writing on the wall
last month when he protested at the fact that the guardians - instead of the
Interior Ministry, itself a radical-leaning organisation  - had the final
say.
'We plan to take part actively in the elections, he said in an interview
reported in the radical newspaper, Salaam. 'But if the Guardian Council
wants to start politicking and disrupt the elections by a series of
cancellations, maybe we will not take part.'
However, the hardline Combatant Clergymen's Society acknowledged last week
that it would contest the elections after Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the
spiritual leader, directly demanded its participation. At Friday prayers
last week, Ayatollah Khamenei warned against 'mischievous elements' and
'those who obstruct the work of officials, those who do not observe piety in
their speeches, those who talk in a certain way to attract some votes - such
people are not qualified to come to the majlis; they must be identified so
that the people do not vote for them.'
But Mr Karrubi's protests about the rejection of so many 'distinguished
personalities' from the initial candidates' list led to the Council of
Guardians reinstating some candidates to its final list.
Those radicals who have been dropped for good include Ayatollah Sadeq
Khalkhali, known as the 'hanging judge' for his activities in the early
years of the revolution, Hojatoleslam Hadi Khamenei, who is Ali Khamenei's
brother, Mr Assadollah Bayat, the radical deputy speaker of the majlis and
Mr Ibrahim Asgharzadeh, a leader of the students who seized the US embassy
in Tehran in 1979.
Ayatollah Khalkhali told Salaam newspaper he had been rejected because of
his 'clear opposition to US interests in the region'. However, Ayatollah
Ahmad Jannati, spokesman of the Council of Guardians said the body had acted
in a 'just and legally responsible manner,' and claimed that some candidates
had been rejected because of their 'extremely limited literacy' and not
because they belonged to any particular faction.
In a clear reference to the inadequacy of revolutionary zeal as a sufficient
condition for public office, the Iranian news agency, Irna, proudly
announced last week that most candidates 'are in their thirties and most
hold bachelors and masters degrees. More than 100 have PhD degrees'.
However, President Rafsanjani has been careful not to be too provocative and
some key radicals, such as the former interior minister, Mr Ali Akbar
Mohtashemi and Mr Karrubi have been allowed to stand. Nevertheless, an
editorial in Salaam warned of 'an unhealthy and one-sided election'.
Despite the differences which have emerged between the radicals and
supporters of Mr Rafsanjani, participants in tomorrow's elections are all
supporters of the Islamic Republic. Those outside the system are not able to
contemplate standing for election.
Nine members of a tame opposition group, the Association for the Defence of
Freedom and Sovereignty of the Iranian Nation, have been in prison since
1990 when they signed an open letter to Mr Rafsanjani asking for
constitutional guarantees of freedom and justice to be implemented.
The group is associated with Mr Mehdi Bazargan, the Islamic Republic's first
prime minister and a septuagenarian who is in disgrace for being a
'liberal'.
On Sunday, Iran launched an air strike against bases of the dissident
Mujahideen-e-Khalq, the largest opposition group, located inside Iraq. Mr
Massoud Rajavi, leader of the Mujahideen, said the attack was an attempt by
Mr Rafsanjani to bolster his popularity in the run-up to the election.

<TEXT>
HYUNDAI Merchant Marine yesterday became the latest of several Hyundai
subsidiaries to be penalised within a week for financial irregularities in
what South Korea's second largest conglomerate claims is a campaign of
intimidation by the government.
Korea's largest shipping company was fined 27.1bn won (Pounds 20m) for tax
evasion between 1987 and 1991 by the Office of National Tax Administration.
Mr Chung Mong-hun, the owner of Hyundai Marine, and two company officials
were also charged for violating tax and foreign exchange rules.
Mr Chung is a son of Mr Chung Ju-yung, the founder of the Hyundai group,
whose new conservative political party captured 31 seats in last month's
National Assembly elections on a platform criticising the government's
economic policy.
Meanwhile, Hyundai Wood Industries yesterday was charged with exceeding
permissible limits on pollution discharges, while three other Hyundai
subsidiaries were denied permission to be registered for the country's

FT  09 APR 92 / Cambodians take the first steps on the road back to
normality / Sensing recovery in the air after 20 years of civil war
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTOR MALLET
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GOING to the seaside on a Sunday may not sound like a big deal to most
people, but the arrival of carloads of day-trippers at the southern
Cambodian resort of Kep each weekend is a sign of how the country is groping
for normality after 20 years of slaughter and civil war.
The town and its luxury villas were destroyed long ago, and today the only
inhabitants are a few squatters living in the ruins and a lone elephant
contentedly munching grass near the beach. Holidaymakers return to the
capital, Phnom Penh, before dark to avoid the depredations of drunken,
unpaid soldiers on the road home.
A hint of recovery, however, is in the air. One businessman is building a
bar in Kep, and others have laid claim to plots of land in what used to be
the town centre. Vendors offer fresh boiled crab and rice, and Tiger beer
imported from Singapore. And at least the road is open; it used to be the
haunt of Khmer Rouge guerrillas.
The confidence inspired by the peace accord signed in Paris last October and
by the arrival of UN troops in Cambodia is equally visible in the battered
but still charming riverside town of Kampot 25km to the west. Long-neglected
hotels are being refurbished, and the welcome signs at the entrances to the
town are freshly painted.
On the bumpy road to Phnom Penh, peasants are taking live pigs to market in
baskets on the back of their mopeds, or driving bullock carts loaded with
timber to sawmills further north. Fish, meat and fruit appear to be
plentiful.
In the capital itself there is feverish economic activity. Ships which have
come up the Mekong River unload cargoes of imported motorcycles, cars,
clothes, beer and soft drinks in the heart of Phnom Penh (a safer route, the
shippers say, than the road from the main seaport of Kompong Som); new and
refurbished hotels offering satellite telephone calls are doing brisk
business; market women are selling decorative plants; the Cafe No Problem
serves champagne and French cheeses and boasts a billiard table; and luxury
cars are again on display in the Peugeot showroom.
Ms Geraldine Seng Mealy, a 29-year-old half-Khmer Frenchwoman, has sold
imported Yves Rocher beauty products in a small shop on the city's main
boulevard since December. It was, she believes, the first foreign shop to
open in Phnom Penh after the peace accord. These days she also has a line of
locally made toys and textiles.
At the museum, staff of the Australian National Gallery are preparing the
catalogue for an exhibition of Khmer artefacts in Canberra, and wondering
how to help the Cambodians protect priceless sculptures from the thousands
of bats in the ceilings which defecate onto the exhibits.
Freelance Cambodian taxi-drivers who could barely handle their borrowed
government cars four months ago are negotiating the city's increasingly
crowded streets with confidence. They are also paying to learn English at
roadside schools, or studying Soviet textbooks containing less than useful
phrases such as: 'Could you explain to me what the term 'socialist realism'
means?'
Foreign investors, many from Thailand, Singapore, Hong Kong and Taiwan, are
looking for opportunities, and consultants Ernst and Young have set up shop
in Phnom Penh. Western and Japanese investors remain generally cautious,
although several companies have won rights to explore for oil offshore.
Few would begrudge Cambodia its recovery, but aid workers are concerned
about the speculative and corrupt nature of the capital's economic boom.
Almost all investment so far has been in services - property (often of
doubtful legal title), hotels, banking and trade - rather than in industry
or agriculture. A request for a Cambodian product - any Cambodian product -
at a stall in the central market produced only a packet of batteries made in
Thailand.
Import-export companies do a great deal of importing and very little
exporting, and such exports as there are - timber, for example - are largely
uncontrolled and unsustainable.
The capital's numerous pharmacies, meanwhile, sell drugs given by aid
agencies to Cambodia, and hypodermic needles labelled 'Unicef' (the UN
Children's Fund).
Down in Kampot, residents are still fearful of Khmer Rouge guerrillas and
landmines in the hills, while the government soldiers and policemen have
only just been paid their wages for January.
Mr Nop Phan, a 20-year-old soldier lying in Kampot hospital, testifies to
the fact that Cambodians will continue suffering the effects of war,
regardless of any economic recovery, long after UN forces have left the
country. He was looking for firewood when his left foot was blown off by a
mine.
'After I heard the broadcasts from Phnom Penh about the UN presence I was
very happy,' said Mr Nop Somnang, the victim's older brother. 'I want to
join them to help with the mine-clearing and everything else.'

   HONG KONG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN's trade representative in Hong Kong, Mr Peter Heap, yesterday
defended the UK's success so far in winning consultancy contracts for the
colony's new HKDollars 114bn (Pounds 8.43bn) airport and related projects
and denied there had been any favouritism.
Mr Heap's intervention comes at a time when the Hong Kong government is
under criticism from some local politicians and the Beijing-sponsored press
for allegedly awarding the lion's share of consultancy contracts to UK
companies.
The government is soon expected to announce the successful consortium to
build the Tsing Ma Bridge, and the winner of the contract to prepare the
site for the new airport - two of the biggest contracts to be awarded.
The complaints stem partly from anti-British elements in the colony. They
also come from pro-Beijing forces who believe the airport and its associated
projects is a UK device to transfer Hong Kong's riches to the UK via
contracts before the 1997 hand over of the colony to China.
Mr Heap said it was to be expected that British engineering consultancies
would do well in winning consultancy work; many of the world's biggest and
best engineering consultancies were British, he said.
He denied the UK had benefited disproportionately in the award of larger
civil engineering contracts. Out of the 25 works contracts awarded only two
had gone to UK companies, he said.
In a written answer to Hong Kong's Legislative Council on March 25, Mr James
Blake, the colony's secretary for works, produced figures which showed that
of the 38 consultancy contracts let, UK companies had figured in 31.

FT  09 APR 92 / World Trade News: Caribbean seeks role as world's paperless
tiger / A look at offshore data processing, the region's new 'clean' growth
industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CANUTE JAMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN AN unpretentious factory building on the outskirts of the famed resort
town of Montego Bay on Jamaica's north coast, the only discernable sounds
are those of computer keyboards and the hum of air conditioners. Several
people sit before rows of computer screens, entering data.
It is neither an office nor a factory. In fact, the office is thousands of
miles away, in New York, Toronto, London. This is the cutting edge of
offshore information processing, a new industry in the Caribbean and one
which countries in the region are exploiting as companies try to make the
technological leap away from paper.
'There are 328bn paper pages in offices in the US and people are looking for
better ways of handling these,' says Mr Taher Behbehani, director of US
operations for the Information Technology Exchange Group. 'Conversion is
costly because this involves substantial data processing. Offshore
operations can reduce the cost of this.'
Converting such data is only one part of the information processing market
which Caribbean countries are seeking. The Dominican Republic, Barbados and
St Lucia, in addition to Jamaica, are becoming centres for the offshore
information processing industry.
The services include processing airline tickets, insurance claims, mailing
lists, coupons for credit card companies, banks and other financial
institutions, hospital patient lists and electronic publishing, hotel and
airline reservations and credit card authorisation. There is continuing and
growing demand for other services such as custom-built software programming,
voice applications, video conferencing, mapping and geological services and
computer-aided designing for architects.
In just one example, a subsidiary of American Airlines ships tickets to
Barbados and the Dominican Republic where they are processed in computers
and the information sent by satellite back to the US.
High speed data transmission facilities - teleports - are being constructed
in Jamaica, Barbados, St Lucia and the Dominican Republic. This allows the
Caribbean to get a slice of the growing telemarketing or phone-based mail
ordering industry. A call made in the US on an 800 toll-free line could be
answered in one of these Caribbean states and the transaction completed in
the US in a few minutes.
The Jamaican teleport, located in Montego Bay, is a Dollars 8.5m (Pounds
4.9m) joint venture by American Telephone and Telegraph of the US, Cable and
Wireless of the UK and Telecommunications of Jamaica. The teleport offers
facilities for voice, facsimile and data transmission, toll-free services
and voice-and-video tele-conferencing.
'We tell our prospective clients that if they can move it from the ground
floor to the fifth floor, then they can move it from the ground floor to
Jamaica for much less,' says Mr Winston Gooden, acting vice-president of
Jamaica Promotions, the island's industrial development agency.
The Caribbean faces competition from the Philippines, Ireland and Singapore,
but feels it can get more than a small share of the fast-growing information
processing market, in which Mr Lawson Nurse, a director of the Barbados
Industrial Development Corporation, says US companies spend about Dollars
50bn per year.
'The information processing industry began here 25 years ago and has grown
steadily,' says Mr Carl Clarke, Barbados' trade, industry and commerce
minister. 'During the early period of the industry's development, the type
of work done was basic and low-skilled. However, in recent years, there has
been a definite shift to the higher value-added type of processing
activities.'
The Caribbean countries have been able to increase their share of the
information processing market through lower wage rates, which are about a
third of that paid for similar work in the US. Recent improvements in the
region's telecommunications infrastructure have also helped. In addition to
the teleports, companies such as Cable and Wireless have been upgrading
several national telecommunications systems.
Mr Gooden says the turnover of workers in the information processing
industry in the US is about 35 per cent, while in the Caribbean a staff
turnover of 5 per cent would be considered high. The accuracy level of
workers in the Caribbean operations is significantly higher than that of
those in the US, he claimed.
The Caribbean countries also benefit from the pollution-free nature of the
industry, which is environmentally compatible with their tourism.

FT  09 APR 92 / World Trade News: Norway may get sharp boost in gas payments
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SEVERAL European buyers of natural gas from Norway's giant Troll field have
agreed to a novel adjustment in the terms of their purchase contracts which
could increase significantly sales revenue for Europe's biggest gas
supplier.
Norway this year will export more than 28bn cubic metres (bcm) of gas to
France, Germany, Holland, and Belgium. However, exports will expand to
around 40 bcm of gas in 1994 under the Troll supply agreement.
Statoil, the Norwegian state oil company, leads the consortium which sells
natural gas on Norway's behalf. Under a new clause in the Troll supply
contract - a so-called price review clause - both the buyer or seller may
demand prices per cubic metre of gas be renegotiated at any given point in
time to better reflect prevailing market conditions.
European demand for natural gas has grown fast since the Troll sales
contract was agreed in 1986 and the price review clause works to the
advantage of Norway which is coming under increased pressure to meet rising
demand.
For example, for each NKr0.01 per cubic metre increase in the sales price of
the gas, Norway's sales revenue could rise by some NKr400m annually if
Norway deemed that market conditions had changed since the original price
was agreed in 1986.
By the year 2010 supplies from the Troll field alone could peak at up to 50
bcm annually. This could mean a massive increase in revenue for Norway.
There are 'fixed criteria' under which market conditions can by definition
be considered to have changed, but these details are known only to the
sellers and buyers.

A multilateral agreement on foreign direct investment is needed to pre-empt

The author, Prof Raymond Vernon of Harvard University, predicts that the
rules for foreign investment will become a major source of tension. 'A bad
multilateral agreement would be better than no agreement at all', said Prof
Vernon, especially, he said, if the alternative is an aggressive US acting
unilaterally.
He argues that the effects of foreign investment are not fully understood
because of the lack of information.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
LEADING Russian politicians in Moscow yesterday played down the danger of
conflict with Ukraine over control of the Black Sea fleet, but action at the
fleet headquarters of Sevastopol underlined the tension between the two
sides.
President Boris Yeltsin sent Admiral Vladimir Chernavin, commander of the
Commonwealth of Independent States naval forces, to Sevastopol to oversee
the transfer of the fleet to Russian control.
This followed Mr Yeltsin's signing on Tuesday of a decree taking the fleet
under Russian jurisdiction - a direct counter to a similar decree issued by
Mr Leonid Kravchuk, Ukraine president, on Monday.
The Ukraine parliament met in emergency session yesterday to discuss the
crisis and Mr Ivan Pliushch, chairman of the Ukrainian parliament, reported
that Admiral Chernavin had told Ukrainian representatives that they could
have a fleet but would have to find new headquarters.
Meanwhile, thousands of pro-Russian demonstrators were reported to have
surrounded the fleet headquarters, brandishing banners saying 'We won't give
up the Black Sea fleet' and 'Sevastopol is a city of Russian glory'.
A spokesman for the Black Sea fleet said demonstrators had come to the
defence of Admiral Igor Kasatonov, the pro-Russian commander of the fleet.
'The whole town has risen up in support of the admiral,' a spokesman said.
But it was not clear that the headquarters was under any imminent danger of
attack by Ukrainians.
Indeed, the Ukrainian minister of defence, General Constantin Morozov, said
pro-Russian forces had surrounded the headquarters of Ukraine's appointee as
commander of the fleet, Counter Admiral Boris Kozhyn, in the early hours
yesterday. Black Sea fleet spokesmen would not comment.
In Moscow, Mr Andrei Kozyrev, the Russian foreign minister, asked his
Ukrainian counterpart, Mr Anatoly Zlenko, for talks in Moscow on Saturday,
the official news agency Itar-Tass reported.
General Dmitri Volkogonov, military adviser to Mr Yeltsin, said: 'It is
inconceivable that there would be war between the two great Slav states on
this issue. We must now set up a commission between the two states to
discuss these questions and we must find a compromise between us. A
compromise is certainly possible.'
But the discussion of the issue in the Ukrainian parliament underscored the
escalation of tensions between Ukraine and Russia. Defence minister, Gen
Morozov, said: 'We see the main problem in the fact that the CIS is not
viable.'
Mr Kravchuk reasserted Ukraine's claim to the Black Sea fleet and to the
Crimean peninsula, where it is stationed.
Nationalist deputies were in truculent mood. 'This is naked Russian
imperialism,' said Mr Mikola Porovsky, who wore an embroidered Ukrainian
peasant shirt under his blue jacket. 'Yeltsin is trying to kill two birds
with one stone. First he wants to deflect attention from the failure of his
economic policy and second he wants to seize property that is not his by
rights.'
Mr Vitold Fokin, the Ukrainian prime minister, said that Russian
vice-president Aleksandr Rutskoi had 'personally deceived me' when he
travelled to Sevastopol over the weekend.

   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Lombard League, the Italian regional party which emerged as the biggest
winner from last Sunday's general elections, is determined to press ahead
with its election pledge to encourage non-payment of taxes as part of its
opposition to the political establishment in Rome.
Mr Marco Formentini, the party's economics spokesman and one of the 55 newly
elected League members of parliament, said it aimed to win control of
Italy's big northern cities. 'With the administration behind us, we will
invite people not to pay their taxes if the money is just going to be
wasted,' he said.
The threat comes as Italy's politicians mull over the outcome of the polls,
which saw a sharp drop in support for the established parties in favour of
smaller groupings and threaten to make the country increasingly
ungovernable.
Mr Formentini warned that the League would use its parliamentary power to
exert strong 'supervision' over government spending, which it claims is
'squandered' on vote-catching projects, especially in southern Italy. The
aim would be to gain seats on parliamentary committees to make it difficult
to pass spending measures not sanctioned by the League, he said.
The League, which gained 8.7 per cent of the national vote to emerge as
Italy's fourth biggest party, is also trying to develop an economic
programme to rebuff attacks that it has no coherent policies of its own.
Mr Formentini said the League would seek to slash spending on health care,
pensions and public-sector pay, while limiting transfers of central
government money to local councils and state agencies. He denied the plans
would lead to a deterioration of services, on the grounds that current
spending on health and pensions was inflated by between 30 per cent and 50
per cent as a result of inefficiency and corruption. On the state railways,
Mr Formentini said the League would dismiss 90,000 of the 200,000 workers.
The party has targeted Milan, where it just beat the Christian Democrats
into second place, as the first big city where it would like to gain
control. The local council, traditionally dominated by the Socialist party,
has been hit by a corruption scandal, and may now be sufficiently weak for
the League to bring down, he claimed.

Brussels proposed a battery of rules yesterday to protect shoppers as

to sell goods in the home instead of the high street, Reuter reports from
Brussels.
Common rules for all EC countries will boost consumer protection as the
'distance-selling' business expands and households face a barrage of offers
to buy goods by mail, phone or fax machine, a Commission spokesman told
reporters. Among the proposals would be a seven-day cooling off period in
which the consumer could decide to pull out of a purchase contract settled
by credit card or other means. Companies which offer goods on television,
for example, would have to ensure they were delivered within 30 days.

The European Commission yesterday proposed streamlining the institutional

and technological development funds, writes Andrew Hill in Brussels.
Mr Filippo Maria Pandolfi, the research commissioner, is pressing for an
increase in Community R&amp;D funding from Ecu2.4bn (Pounds 1.71bn) in 1992 to
Ecu4.2bn by 1997 - 5 per cent of the total EC budget - concentrated more
carefully on selected priority projects.
According to the Commission's R&amp;D strategy document, published yesterday, EC
spending on research and technological development amounted to 2.1 per cent
of gross national product last year, compared with 3.5 per cent in Japan and
2.8 per cent in the US. 'In fact, the Community's current level is similar
to that of Japan 10 years ago,' says the document. The 58-page document
tentatively suggests moving some R&amp;D activities closer to the market to help
meet external challenges, without breaking the rules which say that the EC
can only support research projects, which do not distort competition in the
marketplace.

mining industry.
The government was yesterday said to be nearing a decision as the Russian
gold-mining monopoly, Rossalmaz zoloto, declared that a state monopoly on
sales would be maintained to protect prices.
Mr Yegor Gaidar, the deputy prime minister responsible for economic reform,
has been trying to push through a contract elaborated by Lenzoloto, a
Siberian gold producer, covering an area of 105,000 sq metres, together with
an Australian consortium called Star Technology Systems.
Under the project, Star would obtain a minority stake in a joint stock
company - the other shareholders would be Lenzoloto, the Russian government,
and the local authorities of the Irkutsk region - in return for a badly
needed injection of capital to develop new deposits and reduce waste from
existing mining. Star says it has already secured up to Dollars 150m (Pounds
87.2m) in finance for the project. It has begun producing machinery within
Russia for alluvial mining.
The project, covering all Lenzoloto's mines, provides for all gold produced
to be sold to the state, preserving its monopoly on foreign sales.
But the plan has run into strong resistance from Mr Valery Rudakov, the
powerful Rossalmazzoloto chairman, who said yesterday he wanted to organise
a tender for the development of Lenzoloto's prime Sukhoi Log mine - in which
his own organisation would be able to compete as 'an equal partner'.
Mr Valery Avlov, the general director of Lenzoloto, said he saw no need for
a tender, since this would cause delay and stall work already under way. He
said he had stopped receiving state funds to develop the area.
Mr Rudakov, speaking after a closed seminar at which three North American
companies made presentations to Russian officials, said he had asked Credit
Suisse First Boston to advise him on how to attract foreign investors, and
restructure without going as far as privatising it.
At stake is the government's desire to produce big foreign investment
contracts quickly and develop the flagging gold industry. Also in the
balance is the right of local producers to choose their own partners and
develop the assets.
Mr Yevgeny Bichkov, responsible for the Russian gold depository, said
yesterday that Russia was determined to rebuild reserves which in January
still stood at the low figure of 240 tonnes.

FT  09 APR 92 / Hungarian budget deficit soars
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BUDAPEST
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Hungarian budget deficit surged way above target over the first quarter
of this year against the background of a steeper than expected recession
which has placed hundreds of enterprises on the brink of bankruptcy.
Latest government figures show that accumulated arrears of tax and customs
payments reached Ft 170bn (Pounds 1.22bn) by the end of the first quarter.
This helped push the first quarter budget deficit to Ft 47bn and raises a
question mark over the government's ability to meet its target of
restricting the overall budget deficit for the year to Ft 69bn, or 1.9 per
cent of GDP.
Mr Gyorgy Szapary, the International Monetary Fund's representative in
Hungary, yesterday warned that the situation looked serious enough for the
Fund to take a hard look at the budget overrun in mid-year, given the danger
that it could keep interest rates high, crowd out private investment, and
hold back Hungary's economic recovery. The government first responded to the
tax shortfall last week with 'drastic measures' to seize tax debtors' bank
deposits and impound goods at the border until duties were paid.
It also clawed back tax refunds granted to banks. The underlying reason for
the pressure on the budget became clearer yesterday with new figures which
showed Hungary's economic recession was much deeper than expected.
Recorded gross domestic product fell by 10 to 12 per cent last year, Mr
Szapary revealed.

</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE United Nations secretary-general, Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, has appealed
for a more concerted international drive to solve the Cyprus problem, a
solution to which remains as elusive as ever in spite of intensive UN
mediating efforts.
In his first report on the Cyprus issue since assuming office, Mr Boutros
Ghali has asked the UN Security Council to play a more active role in
brokering a settlement, warning at the same time that the UN would not be
able for much longer to maintain a peace-keeping force in Cyprus 'at the
present scale'.
Mr Boutros Ghali was forced to admit that the repeated efforts made by his
representatives over the past year to bridge the gap between the Greek and
Turkish Cypriot communities had produced not only no progress, but in
certain areas, even 'regression'.
He warned that if his fresh effort to reach a settlement did not succeed,
consideration would have to be given to 'an alternative course of action'.
He did not spell out what course of action he had in mind. He said the lack
of progress had led to an increasing unwillingness on the part of the
countries in the 2,150-strong peace-keeping force, first sent to the island
in 1964, to continue contributions.

FT  09 APR 92 / Trans Dnestr embroiled in an ethnic tug-of-war: The disputed
industrial region
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRYSTIA FREELAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ON THE outskirts of the town of Bendery a member of the Trans Dnestr
National Guard has put down his Kalashnikov to strum a guitar and take a
swig of vodka. His post displays the old red and green flag of the Moldovan
Soviet Socialist Republic, complete with hammer and sickle. A crudely
painted sign proclaims: 'Bendery is, was and will be a part of the Trans
Dnestr Republic.'
Less than a mile of fertile fields separate him from a dozen lightly armed
members of the Moldovan National Guard patrolling concrete barricades. They
fly the tricolour Moldovan flag, distinguishable from neighbouring Romania's
only by the cross at its centre. The spray paint on this side says flatly:
'The Trans Dnestr Republic is not a state.'
Over the past month the two sides have stepped up their struggle for control
over the Trans Dnestr - an industrial region on the banks of the Dnestr
river - with intermittent fighting which has claimed more than 50 lives.
The Trans Dnestr, whose 730,000 inhabitants are 60 per cent Slavic Russians
and Ukrainians and 40 per cent Romanian, is situated within Moldova, a
member of the Commonwealth of Independent States. Moldova was part of
Romania until the 1939 Molotov-Ribbentrop pact under which Stalin and Hitler
carved up eastern Europe, and some 65 per cent of Moldovans are ethnic
Romanians.
In 1990, the Trans Dnestr authorities, fearing that the Moldovan government
would soon seek unification with Romania, declared independence in the hope
that this would force Moldova to adopt a federal structure that would afford
Trans Dnestr the right of secession.
This is unacceptable to Moldova, which is willing to grant the region wide
political, economic and linguistic autonomy but is determined to oust the
ruling Trans Dnestr authorities, viewed in Kishinev, the Moldovan capital,
as 'bandits' who should eventually be put on trial.
The skirmish threatens to escalate now that Moldova has hinted at its
readiness to call on Romania for military support and Trans Dnestr leaders
have appealed for help to Russia and to the Russian-controlled 14th Army
stationed in the region.
After a meeting earlier this week, the foreign ministers of Moldova,
Romania, Russia and Ukraine called for a ceasefire. According to Ukrainian
television reports, Mr Adrian Nastase, the Romanian foreign minister, said
that if the ceasefire did not occur all four countries should deploy
observers to the region.
He also suggested that the Ukrainian military could be called on to maintain
peace rather than the 14th Army whose sympathies for the Trans Dnestr forces
made it inappropriate for this role.
In the Trans Dnestr separatists have been bolstered by signs of support from
Russian conservative politicians and the Commonwealth of Independent States'
military command.
Romania and Russia have supplied weapons to their respective sides. The
Trans Dnestr forces procure their guns from the 14th Army using a novel
technique - Trans Dnestr women storm 14th Army barracks demanding
Kalashnikovs for their fathers, husbands and sons.
Less than 70km from the fighting, the only hardship in the Moldovan capital
of Kishinev is that restaurants close at 8pm, in compliance with the state
of emergency declared by the Moldovan president. But Mr Ion Botnaru, a
senior official at the Moldova foreign ministry, warned: 'Our former
nomenklatura has moved to the Trans Dnestr. They say: 'From here we will
begin the rebirth of the great Russian state.'
'If they win, they will set up a domino reaction of anti-democratic
uprisings throughout the CIS.'
In the Trans Dnestr capital of Tiraspol, which has dissolved into an
anarchic city under siege where daily funerals of victims of the fighting
are a sober counterpoint to the gay, occasionally drunk, roving bands of
colourfully garbed Cossacks, a different view is favoured.
Many Cossacks, mostly from southern Russia, see themselves as protectors of
Russians living throughout the former Soviet Union, a task they would like
the Russian government to assume.
'Who is going to defend the Russians in the Baltic, in Moldova?' asked Mr
Nikolai Mastrykov, a Cossack leader from the Russian city of Krasnodar. 'We
will defend them. (Russian President Boris) Yeltsin is not defending them.'

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
HOPES of early cross-party co-operation to resolve Germany's pressing
political problems faded yesterday.
Just three days after government and opposition had been stunned by
far-right gains in two state elections, leaders of the ruling Christian
Democrats (CDU) and opposition Social Democrats (SPD) retreated to their
former entrenched positions.
While Chancellor Helmut Kohl repeated his offer of 'relevant' discussions
with the SPD, Mr Bjorn Engholm, the opposition leader, laid down rigid
conditions, and party officials on both sides muddied prospects further.
Mr Kohl said in cabinet yesterday that he wanted to start talks immediately
after Easter with SPD leaders at federal and state level, including mayors,
to clear the way for necessary changes to the constitution, and a
redistribution of the costs of unification.
'The voters have made clear that they now expect rapid solutions to pressing
political problems,' he told the cabinet.
Constitutional change was needed, he said, to help stem the flood of
asylum-seekers into Germany and the European Community. It was also
necessary to allow the ratification of the Maastricht treaty on political
and monetary union. He also wanted to discuss the indispensable
restructuring of federal finances to help fund recovery in the former East
Germany. Mr Engholm said that before he would consider talks, he wanted to
see full information on the current state of federal finances, and a
detailed concept for the economic future of the country. He also demanded
that only state prime ministers should be invited.
Mr Hans-Ulrich Klose, the SPD parliamentary leader, meanwhile, said the
party was prepared to talk only if it could take an active part in policy
formulation, and stood firmly by the established party line of no change in
the constitution.
Tempers rose again over the issue of asylum-seekers, 400,000 of whom are
expected in Germany this year, according to Mr Rudolf Seiters, interior
minister. There were calls for the resignation of Mr Erich Riedl, state
secretary in the economics ministry, after he called for a suburb of Munich
to be declared 'a refugee-free zone'. Further evidence of the lapse back
into the familiar pattern of paralysis was provided by SPD officials who
yesterday denounced a package of tax reliefs on unearned income, detailed
weeks ago, as 'unconstitutional'.
Mrs Heidemarie Wieczorek-Zeul, the opposition European spokeswoman,
meanwhile, further stirred up the debate on Maastricht, saying the party
would block the automatic move into monetary union, planned for later this
decade.

<TEXT>
BAYERISCHE Vereinsbank said it had issued a loan worth Kcs1bn (Dollars 34m)
to Skoda Automobilova, Reuter reports from Munich. The bank said it was the
first German bank to issue such a loan denominated in koruna. The loan had
been issued through its Prague branch.
Bayernverein said the branch concentrated on institutional customers but was
planning to extend its activities to mortgage business once the legal
framework for this was in place.
RIETER Holding, the Swiss machinery manufacturer, said an upturn in demand
for spinning machines and cost cutting measures already under way would
considerably improve its 1992 operating result, Reuter reports from Zurich.
'The slight pick up in demand for spinning machines since September leads to
the conclusion the turning-point has been reached in this market,' the
company said in a statement on its 1991 results.
Rieter said earlier 1991 group net profit fell to SFr4.9m (Dollars 3.24m)
from SFr34.9m in 1990, and cut its dividend. Sales fell to SFr1.51bn from
SFr1.65bn.
KONINKLIJKE Pakhoed said it was unlikely its main business of oil storage
would this year maintain the strong results achieved in 1991, Reuter reports
from Rotterdam.
'For Paktank (the storage unit) it will be difficult in the coming year to
match the good results of oil storage in 1991,' the company said in a
statement accompanying its 1991 results.
Tank storage, of both oil and chemicals, made 4 per cent higher operating
profits of Fl 160.8m (Dollars 86.4m) in 1991, while group total operating
profits fell 1 per cent to Fl 196m. Group net profits were down 6 per cent
to Fl 125.2m.
GEBRUEDER Maerz, the German brewer, said acquisitions will boost earnings
and sales this year, allowing the group to expand within Europe, Reuter
reports from Munich.
Maerz made a net profit of DM35m (Dollars 21.2m) on sales of DM1.94bn in
1990/1991, after net profit of DM45.7m on sales of DM1.34bn a year earlier.
Mr Andreas Maerz, chairman, said group sales could rise to DM2.4bn in the
year ending September 30 1992. Earnings would also rise.
He gave no details on net results, but said earnings per share would rise to
DM14.50 from DM10.35 last year.

</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   MEXICO CITY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Mexican government has taken a small step towards reducing its grip over
the national media by announcing it will sell off two television stations
and the newspaper El Nacional.
Channels 7 and 13 have a tiny market share but they offer national
penetration and the ability to compete with Mexico's television giant,
Televisa, which has about 90 per cent of the Mexican television market.
Grupo Vargas, with more than 100,000 subscribers to its pay-as-you-view
Multivison channel, is likely to be one of the strongest bidders, given that
Televisa has been ruled out of the auction.
El Nacional, funded and owned by the government, closely follows the
official line in editorials, although of late reporting has become more
objective and readership has increased. The newspaper does not make money,
and in the absence of a buyer, the government may retain it.
Even if it is sold, the government's more indirect influence over the press
will continue. Almost all Mexican newspapers depend on government
advertising or subsidies to make money, and many journalists rely on a
monthly embute (a stipend) from the department they cover, to boost their
miserable wages. The result is self-censorship, and occasionally, more
direct government control. It is an arrangement difficult to change since it
suits both the newspaper owners and the government.
Independent newspapers and magazines have been flourishing,attracting more
readers and advertisers, but in the provinces independent journalism can be
highly dangerous. During the presidency of Mr Carlos Salinas de Gortari 17
journalists have been killed according to PEN International, usually for
upsetting local policeman, drug dealers, or caciques (local strongmen).

FT  08 APR 92 / Caribbean growth rate falters: The region has been hit by
world recession
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CANUTE JAMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CARIBBEAN economies recorded lower than expected growth last year mainly
because of recession in North America and Europe, and will fare no better
until the industrialised economies recover, according to the Caribbean
Development Bank.
Reporting on the economic performance of its 17 borrowing members, the
Barbados-based bank said the Caribbean had been also affected by the Gulf
war and by reluctance of some governments to implement economic adjustment
policies. 'Most countries reported significant slowdown in the rate of
economic growth while those reporting increases remained concerned about the
need to attain sustainable levels of output growth,' said the CDB.
In attempting to deal with the problems, several countries improved the
management of their fiscal accounts, while using monetary and exchange rate
policies to improve the competitiveness of their exports, the report added.
Guyana and Jamaica completely liberalised their foreign exchange markets and
there was a start or expansion of programmes to sell off state-owned
enterprises in Barbados, Grenada, Guyana and Jamaica. However, the bank said
this had not prevented increasing fiscal deficits which led some countries
to rely more and more on domestic sources for financing the shortfalls,
putting pressure on domestic interest rates.
The recession in industrialised countries affected all major sectors of the
region's economies. Tourism suffered, said the CDB, because of 'the
continued slowdown in economic activity in the US, together with the
outbreak of war in the Persian Gulf which exacerbated fears about the safety
of air travel.'
Export trade outside the Caribbean Community (Caricom) was depressed by the
recession in the major markets, and this was compounded by other
developments such as the reduction of the region's sugar quota to the US.
The bank said this was of major concern, and reported that a 35 per cent
quota cut by the US last year would reduce the Caribbean's export earnings
significantly as it will be forced to sell more sugar at world market prices
which are lower than the preferential price paid by the US.
Reduced production also troubled the regional sugar industry last year, said
the CDB, with cumulative output falling by 3 per cent.
The region's bauxite producers, Jamaica and Guyana, suffered from weak world
prices and a loss of markets following the collapse of the Soviet Union.
Despite an increase in production and exports by Jamaica last year the
island's gross earnings declined, the CDB said,
The region's banana output declined by almost 12 per cent last year, and
there is growing uncertainty over the Caribbean's preferential market in
Europe with the creation of a single market next year. The manufacturing and
construction sectors also declined, the report said.
The bank's forecast will bring little comfort to Caribbean governments. It
said prospects for improvement in economic performance in 1992 were not
encouraging. These prospects depended on the emergence of the long-awaited
recovery in the US and Europe.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Swedish economy has started to see the first signs of a recovery in
export orders, according to a report by the National Institute of Economic
Research yesterday.
For the first time since autumn 1989, more Swedish companies saw an increase
in export orders than reported a decrease, according to the Institute's
Business Tendency Survey for the first quarter of 1992. The pick-up in
export orders came mainly from the US and newly industrialised countries,
the Institute said.
While domestic demand remains weak, companies expect export orders to
increase in the second quarter of 1992, particularly for forestry products
and engineering goods.
The survey reports a further fall in industrial production, with 30 per cent
of companies reporting cuts in volumes, particularly in the construction
materials, engineering, and metal industry sectors.
'The production plans for the current quarter and for the second half of
1992 do point to an increase but any expansion this year may be markedly
restricted by excessively large stocks of finished goods,' the report says.
Nearly half the 1,862 companies questioned have cut jobs.
Unemployment in Sweden rose to 4.2 per cent in March, the highest since
records began in the 1970s, according to the Central Statistics Bureau.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
One early election winner is likely to be the BBC, which is holding its lead
over ITN in the news-programme ratings.
The average Barb figures for the first two full weeks of the campaign put
the audience for the Nine O'Clock News at 6.2m, against 5.7m for News at
Ten. In the second week, however, News at Ten closed the gap and took a
whisker of a lead  - 6.1m against the BBC's 6m  - although that would
probably have to be called a dead heat under BBC rules for dealing with
relatively small samples.
The BBC's One O'Clock News and Six O'Clock News maintained their large lead
over ITN equivalents: 4.2m against 2.7m at lunch and 7.5m to 6.4m in the
early evening in the second week. Newsnight and Channel 4 News continue to
slug it out with Newsnight on 1m to C4's 900,000.
Overall audiences for news programmes were up on the same period last year,
but if you want a sense of perspective Coronation Street and EastEnders are
still pulling in 19.63m and 15.69m respectively.

FT  08 APR 92 / Election 1992: Church divided - Ballot Box
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Tories may be relieved to hear that there will be no eve-of-poll message
to the nation from Lambeth Palace. Dr George Carey, the Archbishop of
Canterbury, has decided, after some contemplation, to stay out of the
election campaign. A radio broadcast a few weeks ago calling on politicians
of all parties to show moral vision was enough.
The Church of Scotland, however, orders these things differently. It has
just issued a report highly critical of Conservative economic and social
policies  - much to the annoyance of the Scottish secretary, Ian Lang, who
has enough on his plate.

FT  08 APR 92 / Election 1992: Tory scientist - Ballot Box
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A lone scientific voice has spoken up to defend the Conservatives against a
barrage of attacks from researchers who say British science has declined
since 1979. Terence Kealey, a clinical biochemist at Cambridge University,
says 'all that criticism of Tory policy is unfair'. He maintains that total
support for university science grew during the 1980s because funding from
non-
government sources (industry, charities and private) doubled.
'I don't personally know anyone who agrees with me,' Kealey admits
cheerfully. But after writing to The Times, challenging the anti-Tory views
of fellow scientists, he received several letters of support from
'distinguished science-policy people'.
Apart from Kealey, the only scientist that Conservative Central Office could
name as a defender of government policy is Philip Treleaven, professor of
computing at London University. He is also the Tory candidate in the London
constituency of Southall.

FT  08 APR 92 / Election 1992: End to ads - Ballot Box
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The 500 or so UK employees of Saatchi &amp; Saatchi  - the agency handling the
Conservative party's election advertising  - will receive an internal
newsletter carrying a spoof ad advising them that a vote for Labour means a
vote for job losses in their own industry  - as Labour intends to ban
tobacco advertising.
The ad shows two boxing gloves, one with 'less ads', the other 'less admen'
printed on them, a la Saatchi's 'double whammy' poster.
On the other hand, given the recriminations between Saatchi and Conservative
Central Office over the party's poor showing in the opinion polls, it may be
that the agency's Tory account is already as good as lost.

FT  08 APR 92 / Election 1992: Colony looks on in sorrow - Ballot Box
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
This may be the last British general election that matters much to Hong
Kong, and the colony is disappointed. The virtual absence of Hong Kong as an
election issue has bruised the collective ego.
The place is also worried that Britain will be ungovernable if there is a
hung parliament and, more to the point, that the resulting deadlock could
delay indefi- nitely the choice of a new governor.
Newspapers have jumped on the suggestion, from some Whitehall official, that
Lord Wilson, the colony's recently ennobled governor, might stay on a bit
longer than the newspapers first thought.
When not worrying about a hung parliament, Hong Kong wrings its hands over
the prospect of a Labour government. It is worried about the impact on the
stock market, about what a Labour victory would mean for UK-China relations
and, most of all, about what a Labour win would mean for Hong Kong. Yet, as
one diplomat pointed out yesterday, the joint declaration has been signed
and the basic law promulgated. No election in Britain is going to change
that.

FT  08 APR 92 / London Stock Exchange: Footsie battles to stay above 2,400
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LONDON'S equity market battled gamely to build on Monday's good showing,
fighting off bouts of profit-taking and bear selling to close above the
crucial 2,400 level on the FT-SE 100-share Index, although well below the
session's best.
Behind yesterday's gritty performance was a brace of encouraging corporate
results from two leading retailers, Next and Tesco, favourable press comment
on the most recent UK economic data, and a strengthening of sterling against
the D-Mark. It was also noted that three-month sterling interbank, a good
guide to rate prospects, fell.
The most recent opinion polls, all of which confirmed a Labour lead of
around two to three points over the Conservatives, appeared to do little
damage to a market which dealers said had already discounted just about
every conceivable permutation for the next parliament.
Commented one dealer, perusing the poll result from Harris confirming
Labour's lead: 'At the moment I feel more of a psephologist than a share
trader.'
The equity market kicked off in fine form, with the leaders marked up
sharply by marketmakers keen to head off any sizeable European buying orders
triggered by the strong performance from Wall Street overnight. The ploy
worked, stifling any big trades early in the session and leading to a minor
setback in the market.
A mid-morning programme trade, said to have been on the buy side, plus some
genuine institutional demand, pushed the market up strongly around midday.
But a weak opening by Wall Street, which moved progressively lower before
London closed, affected sentiment to leave London only moderately ahead on
balance.
The FT-SE Index ended a net 3.3 up at 2,404.2, having touched 2,417.7, the
day's best level, just prior to the Wall Street opening.
Bank shares remained at the forefront of the market's attention, with
Midland Bank moving ahead at the outset on stories, later denied, that
Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation (HSBC) was about to announce the
terms of its merger with Midland. Dealers remain convinced that HSBC will
have to pay a minimum 400p a share.
Retailers Next and Tesco delighted followers with results at the very top
end of expectations, leading to a series of profit revisions by retailing
analysts.
Hopes of imminent good news on Reuters' Globex dealing system encouraged
widespread demand for the company's shares. ICI rose as institutions paid
more heed to the positive long-term stance adopted by its broker, Hoare
Govett, than to the broker's profits downgrade.
Vague rumours around the market that a Labour victory on Thursday would see
the introduction of a windfall profits tax on the highly profitable water
and electricity companies depressed share prices of all the utilities.
Waste Management International made a highly successful UK market debut,
closing around the 610p mark compared with the 585p placing price, with US
buyers easily outweighing UK sellers.

FT  08 APR 92 / London Stock Exchange: Reuters rises on Globex
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and COLIN MILLHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EXPECTATION of an announ-cement today by Reuters that its Globex dealing
system will go 'live' in Chicago lifted the shares 18 to 1141p. Globex,
jointly developed by the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, the Chicago Board of
Trade and Reuters, allows trading in listed futures and options when
exchanges are closed.
Although Reuters refused to comment, analysts said the system had now been
successfully tested and a date had been set for Globex to begin operations.
An analyst predicted that heavy US buying in Reuters would be stimulated by
the development.
Retailers please
There was some good news at last for the high streets, with Next beating
profits forecasts and Tesco coming in with figures at the top end of
expectations.
Next shares rose 5 to 71p, equalling its 1991-92 high, as the retail group
turned a Pounds 40.7m loss into a profit of Pounds 12.3m for the year to
January 31. Market turnover was heavy at 8.6m shares.
Analysts were looking for profits of around Pounds 7m to Pounds 10m, and
were also impressed by the company's forecast that it will pay an interim
and final divided in the current year. Next paid a final dividend of 0.75p
in the last financial year, after passing the interim and failing to pay a
final dividend in the previous year.
Tesco turned in a confidence-boosting profit of Pounds 545.5m, up 25 per
cent. The shares climbed 4 1/2 to 255 1/2 p on turnover of 7.6m, about
double the recent daily average. Supermarket rival J. Sainsbury rose in
sympathy by 6 to 386p. Its results are due on May 12.
BET retreats
Shares in international business services group BET were burdened by a
double dose of negative news, which resulted in a decline of 3 to 114p.
The first blow was delivered by Cazenove, the company's broker. It was
reported to have reduced its dividend forecast for the current year to no
more than 7p, down from last year's 13.25p.
As the market was digesting the downgrading from Cazenove, overnight reports
from the US confirmed that Standard &amp; Poor's, the international credit
rating agency, had lowered its rating on BET's Auction Market Preferred
(AMP) stock from A to A minus. One London analyst was moved to remark: 'This
is confirmation of trading difficulties if any were needed.'
It was learnt after the market closed that BET is refinancing Dollars 140m
of its Dollars 500m of AMPs through a private placement by National
Westminister Bank.
Telecoms group Cable and Wireless, 5 down at 523p, was hurt by downgrades as
analysts differed over the group's revamped strategy. After Monday's rise
and some bullish press and market comments, County NatWest yesterday cut its
forecasts, arguing that C and W was still too reliant on the Honk Kong
telecoms market to see any additional long-term benefits, while
restructuring costs wiped out any short-term relief.
County is looking for Pounds 635m pre-tax in 1992, down Pounds 50m. James
Capel was also reported to have downgraded its figures.
Vodafone Group rebounded, boosted by a buy recommendation by US house Kidder
Peabody. The shares gained 6 to 309p.
Fuel retailer and lubricants group Burmah Castrol slipped 10 to 517p on
losing a US court case against Quaker State Corp over claims involving the
qualities of lubricating products.
BP receded 2 1/2 to 252p on turnover of 14m shares, with an early bout of
strength in the stock, prompted by heavy overnight buying in the US, running
into what was described by oil sector specialists as 'a wall of selling from
the UK and Europe'. Lasmo lost 3 to 195p.
Concern was expressed in some market quarters about the decline in the share
price of holiday group Owners Abroad, which has tumbled from 121p on March 2
to close at 89 1/2 p yesterday, a fall of 6 1/2 on the day.
The group's report and accounts reached analysts yesterday, giving details
of the sale of 690,000 shares by the chairman to a trust group owned by
Owners and used for an employee share ownership scheme.
Mr Howard Klein sold the shares for 108p last week, the share price closing
that day at 105p. There were hints that some leisure specialists had been
surprised at the treatment of certain assets in the accounts.
Rank Organisation continued to attract buyers ahead of the election, its
leisure activities seen as good hedges to a Labour victory. The shares rose
6 to 666p.
Tightly-held Boosey &amp; Hawkes forged ahead 40 to 950p after revealing
improved profits and dividend payout.
An early morning rumour that the takeover terms for Midland Bank had been
announced lifted the shares 10 to 345p. Some talk had the offer price at
410p, although expectations continue to focus on the 380p to 400p range.
Profit-taking in TSB Group left the shares down 5 at 121p.
Chemicals giant ICI continued to attract buying interest on the back of its
international portfolio as investors hedged against the possibility of a
Labour UK government. The shares climbed 11 to 1258p.
In spite of this, house broker Hoare Govett yesterday became the latest to
downgrade the group because of difficult first-quarter trading conditions.
Hoare now expects Pounds 900m for 1992, down Pounds 140m, although it
remains a long-term buyer of the stock.
Water issues had a weak tone ahead of tomorrow's UK general election. Wessex
lost 4 to 378p, but traders pointed out that the stock outperformed the
sector, supported by its joint venture in UK waste disposal with Waste
Management International. Investors, however, are looking for yield
protection at present, as the political situation outweighs possible future
commercial considerations.
Waste Management International, part of a US-based group, successfully
floated 75m shares in London, representing a 20 per cent stake in the
company.
The share price rose to around 610p, from an offered level of 585p. Turnover
came to 3.9m shares, with dealers reporting good demand from New York.
RTZ put on 5 to 574p, boosted by a recommendation from Smith New Court.
Analyst Mr Emil Morfett believes the shares to be a good buy because of the
company's US dollar exposure and the stock's attraction as a hedge both 'pre
and post-election'.
Vickers hardened a penny to 137p. Mr Sandy Morris at County NatWest now
believes the company will go for an outright sale of its Rolls-Royce Motor
Cars subsidiary instead of the partial sale originally intended. Such a sale
could see Vickers rise to 170p, Mr Morris said.

FT  08 APR 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow falls 62 points amid sell
programs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
US STOCK prices plunged across the board yesterday as nervousness about the
decline in Tokyo markets coupled with Wall Street computerised sell programs
wiped more than 50 points off the Dow Jones Industrial Average, writes
Patrick Harverson in New York.
By the close the Dow was down 61.94 at 3,213.55. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500
finished 7.53 weaker at 398.06, while the Nasdaq composite index of
over-the-counter stocks dropped 14.68 to 581.61. Turnover on the New York SE
amounted to 205m shares, while falls outnumbered rises by more than
three-to-one.
In the absence of fresh economic news, and lacking a firm direction from
bonds, the newfound confidence about the economic and earnings outlook that
fuelled Monday's rise vanished yesterday. Some analysts said they detected
the first signs of genuine unease among investors about the effect on US
markets of the heavy losses in Japanese equities. The trigger for the sudden
sell-off, however, was a big computerised sell program mid-afternoon, which
single-handedly wiped 20 points off the Dow average.
One observer said that he believed the program involved a strategic shift of
assets out of stocks and into other forms of investments. The program was
swiftly followed by several others, and amid a lack of buyers, prices
dropped sharply in the final 1 1/2 hours.
One of the few big stocks to buck the trend was General Motors, which
climbed Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 38 in turnover of almost 3m shares. Trading
was delayed at the opening due to an order imbalance on the buy side as
investors responded favourably to news of a 'mini coup' in GM's boardroom.
Mr Robert Stempel, GM group chairman, was ousted from his position as head
of the board's key policy-making executive committee, being replaced by an
outside director.
Airline shares, already undermined by higher oil prices and fears of a fresh
price-cutting war among big carriers, were hit particularly hard. UAL
weakened Dollars 10 1/4 to Dollars 129 1/2 , Delta Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars
58 7/8 , AMR Dollars 4 1/4 to Dollars 67 1/2 and USAir Dollars 3/4 to
Dollars 16 1/8 .
Oil issues, which played a big part in Monday's advance, were weaker. Texaco
lost Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 59 3/4 , Occidental Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 18
7/8 , BP ADR's Dollars 2 1/2 to Dollars 52 1/4 , Chevron Dollars 2 1/8 to
Dollars 65 1/4 and Exxon Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 56 5/8 .
On the Nasdaq market, Right Management plunged Dollars 9 1/2 to Dollars 8
after the company estimated first-quarter earnings would be between 8 and 13
cents a share, down sharply from 36 cents in the same quarter a year ago.
Canada
TORONTO plummeted nearly 50 points or 1.5 per cent, its sharpest drop for 1
1/2 years. Dealers said players have been backing away from the market for
the past month and listless volumes have exaggerated the swings in the
market.
Nervousness over rising inflation and fears the trend towards lower interest
rates has come to an end may have contributed to the sharp losses, some
added. The market is waiting for the US producer and consumer price indices
for March to be released tomorrow and Friday respectively.
The composite index dropped 49.3 to 3,336.6. Declines led advances by 388 to
195 on volume of 25.5m shares.
Confirmation that Olympia &amp; York missed a payment of USDollars 62m on March
25 weakened bank shares, already reeling from the property giant's cash flow
troubles.

FT  08 APR 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei drops below
18,000 to five-year low
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Tokyo
THE NIKKEI average fell below the 18,000 level for the first time since
November 1986 on arbitrage unwinding and heavy selling of banking shares by
foreign investors, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The final reading for the Nikkei was 644.82 or 3.5 per cent down at
17,791.55, after a high for the day of 18,449.82 and low of 17,775.39.
Volume remained thin at 200m shares. Declines overwhelmed rises by 895 to
100, with 111 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks
dropped 45.04 or 3.4 per cent to 1,279.57, and in London the ISE/Nikkei 50
index shed 6.80 to 1,016.91.
Most dealers were surprised by the weakness in the Nikkei. Mr Masami Okuma
at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew said: 'I am really shocked, especially since
sentiment seemed to show signs of recovering on Monday.' He added that many
foreign investors, who had been looking for bargains, had refrained from
activity due to the bearishness.
The sharp falls in the Nikkei futures on the Osaka market were triggered by
a plunge in the Nikkei 225 futures on the Singapore International Monetary
Exchange. Rumours that Japan's stock exchange officials were considering
further restrictions to limit derivatives trading worried some market
participants.
Foreigners were leading sellers of banking shares. The Nikkei 500 bank index
has fallen 20 per cent during the past 10 trading days, against a 12 per
cent decline in the Nikkei. Mr Alan Bell, deputy head of research at Baring
Securities, said a further fall in the banking sector could pull the Nikkei
average down by a further 1,000 to 2,000 points.
Prominent losers in the financial sector included Industrial Bank of Japan,
down Y120 to Y1,520, Mitsubishi Bank, Y170 weaker at Y1,520, and Fuji Bank,
which fell by its daily limit of Y200 to Y1,270.
Less liquid shares in the Nikkei 225 fell on arbitrage-related selling.
Shinagawa Refractories lost Y58 to Y843 and Daito Woollen Spinning and
Weaving declined Y50 to Y850.
Nippon Telegraph and Telephone finished Y14,000 down at Y600,000 on
depressed sentiment. Investors were also discouraged by the company's plans
to lower prices of long distance calls, which is expected to squeeze NTT's
profits by as much as Y80bn.
Some industrial blue chips were firm on bargain hunting. NEC improved Y9 to
Y984 and Fujitsu edged ahead Y2 to Y659. However, semiconductor-related
stocks, which rose previously on hopes of a market recovery in the US, lost
ground on short-term profit-taking. Teac, the most active issue of the day,
relinquished Y56 to Y825.
In Osaka, the OSE average fell 474.65 to 19.410.20 in volume of 8.5m shares.
Roundup
TOKYO'S 3.5 per cent fall depressed most of the Pacific Rim, with Seoul
finishing at its lowest level for 18 months. Kuala Lumpur remained closed.
HONG KONG had Monday's losses reversed on bargain hunting and the Hang Seng
index gained 29.53 to 4,926.43 in turnover of HKDollars 1.77bn, after
HKDollars 1.38bn.
HSBC Holdings, which has been driven lower recently on concern over its
planned merger with Midland Bank, of the UK, and its exposure to Olympia &amp;
York, the troubled Canadian property group, recovered HKDollars 1 to
HKDollars 39.25.
SEOUL was depressed by news that the central bank planned to tighten money
supply later this month. The composite index fell 10.93 to 579.09 in
turnover of Won287,84bn.
SINGAPORE was slightly easier, the Straits Times Industrial index ending
1.34 off at 1,385.73 in turnover of SDollars 85.3m.
TAIWAN fell on late selling. The weighted index declined 38.36 to 4,613.74
in turnover of TDollars 12.37bn. against TDollars 11.8bn.
MANILA's composite index rose a further 8.39 to 1,139.82 in turnover of 135m
pesos. Philippine Long Distance Telephone put on 15 pesos to 845 pesos
following a good overnight gain in the US.
BANGKOK rose on expectations that the new prime minister would soon be
appointed. The SET index added 5.77 at 832.39 in Bt5.6bn turnover.
BOMBAY's fall continued, with the BSE index ending 39.46 lower at 4,023.11.
AUSTRALIA closed off its intraday high as the market reacted to the fall in
Tokyo. The All Ordinaries index, which had risen 16 points earlier, finished
just 6.9 ahead at 1,583.7 in turnover of ADollars 258.5m.
News Corp was 12 cents firmer at ADollars 17.82, Coles Myer rose 14 cents to
ADollars 11.68 and BHP advanced 8 cents to ADollars 13.52.
NEW ZEALAND was pulled lower by weakness in Telecom shares. The NZSE-40
index shed 10.47 to 1,390.83 in turnover of NZDollars 20m. Telecom declined
12 cents to NZDollars 2.02.

FT  08 APR 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Yen weakness continues
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE YEN continued to show signs of weakness during a quiet day in the UK
currency markets, writes Emma Tucker.
The frailty of the Japanese currency was a reflection of growing concern
about the domestic economy, analysts said, with the plunge in the Japanese
equity market undermining the yen.
The dollar gained on the Japanese currency to Y133.23/33 in London from the
previous day's close of Y132.65.
The short-term outlook for the dollar was still dominated by worries about
the US recovery, proving to be slower than expected, and speculation over a
consequent cut in US base rates and a possible rise in German interest
rates.
By mid-afternoon in London the dollar was sitting at DM1.6255/65 after a
DM1.6275/85 start. After trading firmly against the yen and the D-Mark in
late Asian trading, it closed in Tokyo at DM1.6280/85. It finished in London
at DM1.6250.
Dealers said they expected the dollar to remain in a narrow range until
tomorrow's UK general election. US producer and consumer price data,
released later this week, could also give the market a jolt.
The US currency finished New York trading last night at DM1.6210/20 and
Y133.05/15, compared with Monday's close of DM1.6255 and Y133.17.
The pound perked up and regained some of the ground lost to the D-Mark
recently. Many traders suspected the Bank of England had been buying through
the UK clearing banks. Sterling ended in London at DM2.8425, up from a
previous DM2.8375.
Mr Gerard Lyons, chief economist at DKB International in London, said: 'It
was very much a quiet day. The markets are going to stay in their current
state until the end of the week. With all the opinion polls showing pretty
much the same result, the key test now is election day itself.'
While many traders are expecting a rise in interest rates to protect
sterling if Labour were to win the general election, Mr Lyons said the real
influence on base rates would be the attitude of international investors,
likely to be influenced by what domestic investors do on Friday.
The growing support for far-right parties in Germany's state elections last
Sunday contributed to the D-Mark's fall across the board.
'The D-Mark has been upset by political movements,' said one dealer,
although she added that there was enough political uncertainty elsewhere in
Europe to prevent it falling too far.
Meanwhile, the French franc continued to benefit from the appointment of Mr
Pierre Beregovoy as prime minister last week. Mr Beregovoy is due to make a
policy statement to parliament today. Some dealers said it might be a signal
for a further advance by the French currency.

FT  08 APR 92 / Money Markets: Interbank rates ease
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THIN TRADING, confined mainly to the under one-week range, characterised a
dreary day in the UK money markets yesterday.
'The whole thing has just run out of steam,' said one dealer. 'The market is
tucked up in bed, waiting for Friday morning.'
Interbank rates continued to point to higher base rates after tomorrow's
general election, but the pressure for a rise has eased considerably over
the past two days.
The key three-month
interbank rate softened to 10 15/16 - 13/16 per cent from 11-10 15/16 per
cent. When a batch of opinion polls put Labour decisively ahead of the
Conservatives last week, the three-month rate had shot upwards to a nervous
11 3/16 - 1/16 per cent. At the longer end, the one year rate eased to 11
1/8 -11 per cent from 11 5/16 - 1/16 per cent.
The steadier performance of the pound helped to create yesterday's calmer
atmosphere. But although the market was less jittery, there was still
considerable underlying nervousness about what would happen to sterling if
the Labour party were to edge ahead of the Conservatives in the early hours
of Friday morning.
The June sterling contract opened four basis points firmer at 88.92 and
drifted around the 88.90 level in fairly thin trading. It finished at 88.90.
Meanwhile, the Bank of England provided the market with relatively cheap
money.
The Bank initially forecast a shortfall of Pounds 400m, but raised that
figure by Pounds 250m just prior to its first round of operations at midday.
In the morning round it bought Pounds 460m band-2 bank bills at 10 3/8 per
cent.
The shortage was later trimmed to Pounds 600m. The overnight rate slipped to
8 1/4 -8 per cent, but only another Pounds 54m of band-1 bank bills at 10
3/8 per cent changed hands. No late help was required and the overnight rate
closed at 8 3/4 - 5/8 per cent.
The Federal Reserve refrained from money market operations yesterday. The
lack of a draining operation, with Federal Funds softer than the 4 per cent
target, was not an indication that the Fed was shifting to an easier policy
stance, economists said.
Some had expected the open market desk to drain reserves from the banking
system, possibly through a two-day matched sale-purchase transaction, in a
bid to firm the key Fed Funds rate.

FT  08 APR 92 / International Capital Markets: Spanish futures and options
trade enters new phase - The launch of a bond contract tailored to generate
more foreign business
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The launch of futures and options contracts on 10-year Spanish government
bonds on Friday marks a further stage in the rapid expansion of the
country's derivatives markets.
The development of futures and options trading has been fuelled by the
liberalisation of Spain's financial markets, allowing a large inflow of
foreign investment. On the domestic front, new legislation designed to pave
the way for collective investment trusts to use futures and options is set
to boost trading further.
Two and a half years after the country's first derivatives exchange was set
up, Spain's two exchanges have been restructured to operate under a single
holding company. Meff Renta Variable trades equity products in Madrid; Meff
Renta Fija lists interest rate and currency products in Barcelona.
The future on the 10-year notional government bond, and the option on the
future, is of particular interest to international investors, whose bond
holdings are concentrated at the long end of the yield curve. 'We have seen
substantial interest from non-resident clients,' said Mr Luis Lucena, a
government bond trader at Banco NatWest in Madrid.
'The (existing) five-year contract is not liquid, and the three-year
contract is too short for non-residents.' The exchange also lists a
three-month Madrid interbank offered rate (Mibor) contract.
The contract will encourage spread-trading between different bond markets.
Since most liquid bond futures are based on 10-year bonds, the creation of a
10-year Spanish bond future will allow dealers to trade between, for
example, 10-year German bund futures and 10-year Spanish bond futures.
However, some traders have expressed doubts about the potential liquidity of
the 10-year contract, due to the small size of the cash market. The Spanish
Treasury only started issuing 10-year bonds two years ago, but has assured
the market that it plans to increase activity in the 10-year area. Even the
moderately successful three-year contract is much less actively traded than
the cash market, according to traders.
On the equities side of the business, Meff RV launched futures and options
on the renamed Ibex 35 Spanish stock index in January. Average daily volume
in March reached close to 10,000 contracts (futures and options) per day,
according to Mr Jose Massa, chief executive of Meff RV.
However, the contracts are not sufficiently liquid for many institutional
investors. 'The size of the contracts is very small,' said one London-based
equity derivatives trader. 'You you would have to buy about 50 contracts to
have the equivalent of one FT-SE contract.'
Some traders have suggested that fees should be cut on large trades, both
for equity and bond products, to encourage institutional participation.
The exchange will start trading individual stock options in September.
Initially, options on three to five liquid stocks, increasing to 15, will be
listed. 'There will be a lot of interest in options on the major stocks,
like Telefonica and the leading banks,' said one trader.
Meff RF's currency contracts, on the other hand, have flopped. Both
pesetas/dollar and pesetas/D-Mark contracts are scarcely traded.
Because Spain acted quickly to develop its derivatives markets, it does not
face the same problems as the Italians, who plan to launch government bond
futures this summer, but will have to compete with a successful rival
contract on the London International Financial Futures Exchange.

FT  08 APR 92 / International Bonds: EC adds Ecu185m to existing deal in
quiet day
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOLLOWING a flurry of new international bond issues on Monday, the market
returned to the subdued and cautious tone which has prevailed for several
weeks.
The European Community launched the only substantial issue of the day,
adding Ecu185m to its outstanding deal maturing 1998. The 9 1/4 per cent
bonds were reoffered to investors at a fixed price of 101.836, where the
yield is 8.83 per cent - 5 basis points more than the yield available on the
outstanding Ecu935m in the secondary market.
The pricing was seen as sensible by market participants, offering an
incentive to buy the new paper. However, appetite for bonds is weak and
firms saw slow buying.
BNP Capital Markets, which lead managed the deal, said that buyers included
east Asian institutional investors and some UK and continental European bond
fund managers. The deal was quoted by the lead manager at 101.80 bid, a
shade below the reoffer level.
The proceeds of the issue were swapped into floating-rate Ecu for the
borrower, at a rate thought to be about 26 basis points below the London
interbank offered rate (Libor) for Ecu deposits. The proceeds are being
on-lent to Romania to back economic development in that country.
Few borrowers are looking to launch substantial issues in a weak market.
Syndicate officials said Finland still hopes to raise Dollars 1bn 10-year
funding, although no date or pricing has been set. Compagnie Bancaire, the
French financial institution, is thought to be considering a Dollars 400m
five-year deal.
Of Monday's issues, Export Development Corporation's Dollars 400m 10-year
deal was quoted by lead manager Credit Suisse First Boston around the launch
spread of 27 basis points over US Treasury bonds. However, participants in
the deal said that the issue remained only partially sold to end investors.
Ericsson's Dollars 150m five-year deal was freed to trade yesterday morning.
By the close, the yield spread had widened to about 95 basis points, from 90
basis points at launch.

FT  08 APR 92 / Government Bonds: Italian market calms after post-election
slide
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS and PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ITALIAN government bonds levelled off after Monday's slide as the full
results of this week's elections confirmed the weak position of the ruling
coalition.
Given the instability of Italian politics, a small majority of seats in the
chamber of deputies was seen as inadequate to produce a stable government.
Further elections could follow later in the year.
The news prompted mixed views in the bond market. On the one hand, the lack
of a decisive result was seen as the prelude to another weak government, one
which was unlikely to get to grips with the country's dire fiscal position.
That makes it less likely that Italy will meet the Maastricht conditions for
economic convergence in the short term, postponing any greater convergence
with other European bond markets.
Optimists, however, claimed the result would hasten an overhaul of the
Italian political establishment.
In a heavy day on Liffe, with more than 23,000 contracts traded, the Italian
bond future was trading at 97.83 late, close to its closing levels of the
day before. At a yield equivalent of 12.68 per cent (gross of withholding
tax), Italian bonds are now around 4 2/3 percentage points above their
German counterparts.
UK government bonds gained confidence as sterling strengthened, helping the
long gilt future on Liffe to climb back up close to 94 for the first time in
a week.
The market has settled on the view that this week's elections will fail to
provide an absolute majority.
Against this background, the better news from foreign exchange markets
reduced some fears that sterling would come under pressure after the
election, helping bonds to recover and providing an opportunity for some
profit-taking during the afternoon. The long gilt future, which opened at 93
3/8 , was trading at 93 29/32 late, a gain of around half a point.
The gains were also reflected in the cash market, with the 9 per cent
benchmark bond maturing in 2011 gaining  5/16 of a point on the day to close
at 94 5/16 , for a yield of 9.65 per cent. Among 10-year bonds, the 9 3/4
per cent bonds due 2002 gained a third of a point, to close on a yield of
9.92 per cent.
US Treasury prices firmed at both ends of the maturity range as trading
remained light ahead of today's auction of seven-year notes.
In late trading, the benchmark 30-year bond was up  3/16 at 101 11/32 ,
yielding 7.876 per cent. The two-year note was also higher, up  5/32 at 100
27/32 , yielding 5.278 per cent.
As on Monday, investors were cautious about committing themselves to the
market before today's sale of Dollars 9.75bn in seven-year notes. Prices at
the long end had been lower as players made room on their books for the new
securities, but the continued sluggishness of the economic recovery and
hopes for an easing of monetary policy helped bonds recover the lost ground.
The short end, meanwhile, was aided by expectations that the maturation of
cash bills next week will trigger a shift of cash into shorter-dated
government securities.
GERMAN government bonds continued their gains of Monday - but only after a
rumour, later denied, that a compromise had been reached over the public
sector pay dispute.
Late in the day, the yield on 10-year bunds fell further, to 7.92 per cent,
from a high of around 7.95 per cent on the day - a firm move back below 8
per cent for the first time for three weeks. On Liffe, bund futures climbed
from an opening of 87.77 to 87.94 late.
AFTER the government support given to the Japanese bond market on Monday,
and with a stronger yen, the market in Japanese government bonds opened
firmly in Tokyo. However the shakiness of recent days quickly returned as
Japanese share prices tumbled yet again, this time taking the Nikkei average
to below 18,000 by the end of the day.
The bond market has failed to take heart from the battering share prices
have taken, as logic suggests it should. Instead, fears about the yen and
pervasive gloom in Tokyo, together with a feeling that the official discount
rate will not be cut further, have helped fuel selling in recent days.
The yield on the benchmark bond no 129, which opened at 5.575 per cent,
closed at around 5.645 per cent. During the London trading day, prices
slipped further, pushing the yield up to 5.67 per cent, before reverting to
around its Tokyo close.

FT  08 APR 92 / International Company News: Nationwide and banks help fund
housing deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A Pounds 135m (Dollars 232.2m) loan package to finance a transfer of council
properties to housing association ownership was signed this week in the
largest 'block transfer' of council housing stock yet completed in the UK.
Broomleigh Housing Association, a non-profit making trust set up by housing
officials of Bromley Council in Kent, is buying 12,400 properties from the
council. The houses and flats will be let to existing tenants but under new
ownership.
The biggest provider of funds for the transaction is Nationwide Building
Society, which has committed Pounds 45m. An additional Pounds 90m in three
facilities has been provided by a small syndicate of banks led by National
Westminster.
Other syndicate members are Bank of Scotland, Scotia Bank, Banque Paribas,
National Australia Bank and United Bank of Kuwait.
The syndicated facilities comprise two term loans to fund the initial
purchase, with an underlying revolving credit facility to meet future
funding needs. The long-term committed funding is costing Broomleigh 1.5 per
cent over the London interbank offered rate. Fees are undisclosed, although
the housing association has paid bankers and lawyers a total of Pounds 4.7m
in fees.
The loans are long-term and complex because the housing association is
committed to charging low rents. For example, it has undertaken to raise
rents by no more than 2 per cent above inflation for the first four years.
Hence rental income will not cover interest and maintainence costs for
several years.
Borrowings should peak at Pounds 135m in the seventh year of the deal, while
the housing association is paying the council an initial Pounds 116.9m for
the properties.
Mr Keith Exford, Broomleigh chief executive, said the association was
seeking an extra Pounds 15m funding to cover a development programme.

Compass Airlines
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NAURU, the tiny but rich Pacific island nation, yesterday lodged a revised
ADollars 55m (USDollars 42.3m) takeover bid for Australia's failed Compass
Airlines, after the carrier's provisional liquidator rejected an earlier
offer, Reuter reports from Sydney.
Mr Kinza Clodumar, Nauru finance minister, met in Sydney with Nauru's joint
venture partner, Austfin, a private merchant bank, before taking the offer
to the airline's liquidator.
Under the bid, the Nauru government would own 75 per cent of Compass and
Austfin the rest. The ADollars 55m bid seeks mostly the popular
budget-priced domestic carrier's good name. It will leave spare parts and
other assets for Compass shareholders to dispose of in the liquidation
process.
'We believe people will flock back to Compass,' said Mr Duke Minks, Austfin
managing director. 'There are a lot of costs in setting up an airline and we
estimate our offer is one-quarter of the cost of establishing a new
airline.'
Compass plunged into provisional liquidation in December, leaving 125,000
travellers with worthless tickets. It has since sought capital injections of
between ADollars 30m and ADollars 60m.
Last week the liquidators said they would sell Compass to Southern Cross
Airlines, a carrier claiming strong financial backing but with no aircraft
in the air. Nauru said its bid would give creditors 28 cents for every
ADollars 1, compared with Southern Cross' offer of 9 cents per ADollars 1.

FUJI Heavy Industries, the Japanese maker of Subaru cars, said it would post
parent pre-tax losses of Y4.8bn (Dollars 35.82m) for the year ended March
31, 1992, against a December forecast of Y1bn taxable profits, Reuter
reports from Tokyo.
Fuji Heavy, which is affiliated to Industrial Bank of Japan and Nissan
Motor, posted pre-tax losses of Y63.62bn in 1990-91, mainly due to poor
domestic and US sales.
It also lowered its forecast for parent net profits to Y500m in 1991-92,
from a December forecast of Y7bn, against losses of Y66.46bn in 1990-91. The
downward revision was based on an appraisal of its securities losses, it
said.
It lowered its forecast of parent sales slightly.

FT  08 APR 92 / International Company News: Fat bonuses for big hitters -
The return of high earnings at Wall Street
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Whisper it; just one year after the US securities industry posted record
losses, multi-million dollar bonuses are back in fashion on Wall Street.
In the past few weeks a host of company proxy statements have revealed how
much top executives in the securities industry were rewarded for 1991's
record earnings.
At Merrill Lynch, Mr William Schreyer, chairman, picked up almost Dollars 6m
for the company's best year, and he could earn another Dollars 10m or more
from stock options that came with his pay packet.
Over at Morgan Stanley, the three most senior executives earned more than
Dollars 5m each for steering the securities firm to record profits in 1991.
With stock options, their pay totals nearer Dollars 8m apiece.
Even the chairman of Bear Stearns, a smaller firm, pulled in Dollars 5.3m,
while his counterpart at the much bigger Shearson Lehman Brothers earned
Dollars 2.8m.
These are a few of the numbers that made the newspapers. Behind the
headlines lie hundreds more multi-million dollar and multi-thousand dollar
payments to traders, analysts, arbitrage experts, underwriting managers and
senior executives.
In the case of some specialists, their pay cheques exceeded even those of
the chairmen and chief executives.
The payouts on Wall Street stand out in contrast to much of the rest of US
business, which has been put on the defensive over the issue of pay and
bonuses by indignant shareholders who want to bring compensation more into
line with profits and performance.
Wall Street's highest paid executives have escaped the criticism reserved
for the chairmen of Time Warner, United Airways and ITT because their
businesses have performed so well in the past year that shareholders have
had no reason to complain.
What must be particularly galling for outsiders is that the big bonuses on
Wall Street are being handed out at a time when the US economy is still
struggling to climb out of the longest recessions in its history.
However, for Wall Street the timing could not be better, coming at the end
of a three-year period when pay levels in the securities industry were
either frozen or cut back because of the slump in earnings.
Fuelled by rising share prices, falling interest rates, record levels of
bond and equity issues and heavy investor activity in stock markets, Wall
Street firms last year earned fat fees and massive trading profits.
Equally important, return on equity improved rapidly. Pre-tax return on
equity at Merrill Lynch rose from 9 per cent in 1990 to 27 per cent last
year, at Morgan Stanley from 20 per cent to 36 per cent, and at Bear Stearns
from 21 per cent to 36 per cent.
The share prices of publicly quoted Wall Street houses have risen sharply
over the past 12 months.
On a strict pay-for-performance basis, the money has been well-earned, much
as it was in the good years of the 1980s when large bonuses were handed out
like confetti.
Yet there are important differences between that carefree, spendthrift era
and today.
The most fundamental concerns the distribution of profits.
In the 1980s, everyone enjoyed a big bonus during the good times,
irrespective of their contribution to earnings.
Today, things have changed, says Ms Joan Zimmerman of G Z Stephens, a New
York executive recruiting firm. 'Given the cost-consciousness and
profit-consciousness that has finally begun to sink in on Wall Street, firms
have clearly differentiated between the significant producers and
originators, and those people who are merely processors of in-house deals.'
That the big hitters on Wall Street have been paid so well is not just a
reflection of their positions at the top of the career ladder.
They received big cheques because they delivered. If they had not brought in
lots of revenue, their rewards would have been much smaller.
This is the second break from the recent past. In the 1980s there was little
downside earnings risk for senior executives on Wall Street, who were
normally guaranteed a certain level of compensation no matter what the
results. If the firm suffered a bad year, management saved money by reducing
compensation or shedding jobs among junior and mid-level staff.
Since then, Wall Street firms have realised it makes no sense to relate the
pay of lower level executives to performance because they cannot be expected
to bring in much revenue so early in their careers.
Now, senior professionals are having to bear the brunt of any swings in
profitability. Wall Street insiders say there are plenty of examples this
year of firms which did not give big bonus cheques to senior executives in
certain departments - mergers and acquisition and corporate finance come to
mind - because those particular lines of business fared poorly in 1991.
In spite of this new approach, there is concern that the record earnings of
1991 and the strong start to 1992 could raise expectations on Wall Street
staff to dangerous levels.
Mr Vincent Perro of Sibson, a human resources management consultancy, warns:
'Firms run the risk of losing some of the discipline they gained during the
lean years.'
Although some have put performance management systems in place that help
identify, and reward, the real revenue earners, employees may fall into the
trap of thinking that last year's bonuses, and those in the immediate
future, should compensate for the relatively meagre returns of 1989-90.
Trying to set some sort of ceiling on pay and expectations is difficult
because it runs counter to logic on Wall Street. 'The basic tenet of the
business is that you have very portable, valuable assets, and it is
difficult to artificially restrain the market for those assets,' explains Mr
Perro.
Just take at look at Salomon, which undertook a very public reform of its
compensation system in the wake of last year's bond trading scandal.
The new management of the firm pledged to make no promises on pay, and to
align compensation with performance.
Yet the new policy contributed to a wave of departures by unhappy staff, and
Salomon was forced to issue some up-front guarantees on pay to keep
executives who threatened to leave for rival firms.
As Ms Zimmerman puts it: 'There was some wishful thinking in executive
suites that (Salomon's new approach) would influence the general mentality
on the Street. But 1991 was the most profitable year in Wall Street's
history, and the reality was that firms had to reward the best people or
stand a very good chance of losing them.'

PHILLIPS Petroleum, the Oklahoma-based energy and chemicals group, said it
expected to post an operating loss in the first quarter, Reuter reports.
The company said it would also take two special charges. The first is an
estimated Dollars 93m pre-tax charge for workforce reductions which took
place in the first quarter.
The second is a Dollars 39m pre-tax extraordinary loss related to the early
retirement, through refinancing, of the company's 13 3/4 per cent
subordinated debentures and 13 7/8 per cent senior notes.
The refinancing of an early debt redemption is expected to reduce the
company's annual pre-tax interest expense by about Dollars 100m a year,
based on recent interest rate levels.
Phillips's total debt was Dollars 4.3bn on March 31.

RPM, the Ohio-based coatings, sealants and adhesives group, has acquired
Martin Mathys, a privately owned Belgian coatings company.
Terms were not announced.
Martin Mathys, which distributes its products in Belgium, France, Germany
and the Netherlands, had sales of Dollars 24m last year. The group also had
Dollars 18m cash in the balance sheet, according to Chase Manhattan Bank,
its advisers.
'This is an extremely profitable and lean family-owned organisation in a
lacklustre sector, enjoying earnings before interest and taxes equivalent in
recent years to between 14 and 16 per cent of turnover,' said Mr James
Conley, a vice-president at Chase. He said the multiple was much higher than
multiples in most recent deals in the industry.
The acquisition is RPM's largest so far in Europe. The company already has
some industrial operations in Europe, having recently acquired two
Rust-Oleum businesses in the Netherlands and France.

CUMMINS Engine, the US diesel engine manufacturer, said it expected to
report a profit for the first quarter, AP-DJ reports.
The company posted net income of Dollars 17.2m, or Dollars 1.02 a share, in
the same period a year earlier, after a big gain from an accounting change.
Without the gain, Cummins would have posted a loss of Dollars 34.3m, or
Dollars 2.44, for the period.
Cummins added that it expected second-quarter profits to exceed those of the
first quarter, assuming there was 'no deterioration in business conditions'.
In last year's second quarter, Cummins posted a loss of Dollars 17.2m, or
Dollars 1.29.
Mr James Henderson, president and chief operating officer, said 1991 had
been a year of 'significant progress' for the company, in spite of recession
in most of its world markets.
Mid-range engine volume increased 6,000 units over 1990 levels, while
heavy-duty engine volume dropped by about 18,000 units.

ORION Pictures, the US film company whose Silence of the Lambs last week
walked off with five Academy Awards, yesterday unveiled a third-quarter net
loss of Dollars 29.2m, or Dollars 1.30 a share, against a deficit of Dollars
15.6m, or 75 cents, a year earlier.
In spite of its string of successes - Orion has been operating under Chapter
11 bankruptcy protection since December.
The results coincided with an announcement by New Line Cinema, an
independent US film production and distribution company, that it might
scupper its rescue plan for Orion if it could not reach an agreement with
Orion creditors by next Tuesday .
Mr Michael Lynne, New Line's president, said he was disappointed the key
parties were unable to resolve their differences.
New Line has been working with Metromedia, which has a 70 per cent stake in
Orion, to propose a joint reorganisation plan. Under the proposal, New Line
would inject about Dollars 12.5m in cash into Orion and Mr Kluge's
Metromedia would match that amount. Orion's bondholders would receive about
45 per cent of the outstanding captal stock of the reorganised Orion,and New
Line would hold about 46 per cent Orion. Metromedia would be left with about
7.5 per cent of Orion. A Dollars 29m note from Orion to Metromedia would
also be exchanged for equity in New Line, leaving Metromedia with about 11
per cent of New Line stock.
Orion's malaise was reflected in its third-quarter figures. Revenues fell to
Dollars 94.8m from Dollars 119.4m the previous year, while the company's
gross profit tumbled to Dollars 4m from Dollars 19.3m. For the first nine
months, it suffered a net loss of Dollars 102.1m or Dollars 4.54, against a
loss of Dollars 14.9m, or 78 cents, a year ago. Restructuring costs were
Dollars 6.23m in the nine months and Dollars 4.89m in the quarter.
Mr Peter Jovanovich, former president and chief executive of Harcourt Brace
Jovanovich, has left the publishing and insurance company for
Macmillan/McGraw-Hill's school publishing division.

CHINA MERCHANTS, one of Beijing's biggest companies operating in Hong Kong,
yesterday agreed to pay Pounds 100m (Dollars 170m) for a 15 per cent
interest in Modern Terminals (MTL), from the Peninsular and Oriental Steam
Navigation Company and Commonwealth Development Corporation.
The share of MTL will give China Merchants a stake in Hong Kong's second
largest container operator and a front seat in bidding for the construction
and operation of the colony's proposed ninth container terminal.
P&amp;O sold 8.1 per cent of its 23 per cent stake in MTL for Pounds 55m
(Dollars 95.7m), realising a profit of Pounds 49m on book value. CDC, a UK
government financial institution which invested Pounds 2m in 6.9 per cent of
MTL in 1975, walks away with Pounds 45m.
P&amp;O will retain 14.9 per cent of MTL. The capital released from the sale
will allow it to expand in the region.
MTL's other shareholders are Wharf, which owns 25.6 per cent, and Swire,
which has 13 per cent.

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE court-appointed administrators of Maxwell Communications Corporation
(MCC), the UK-based company once controlled by the late Mr Robert Maxwell,
were last night granted a 60-day extension of their exclusive right to file
a reorganisation plan for the company.
The delay was granted by Ms Tina Brozman, the New York bankruptcy court
judge who has overseen the running of MCC since last December, when the
company filed for protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of US
bankruptcy law.
At present MCC is operating under a complex arrangement that permits the
Macmillan publishing company and Official Airline Guide, both MCC
subsidiaries, to function in the US and requires co-ordination between New
York and UK court admin-istrators of the Maxwell empire.
Judge Brozman granted the extension, to June 15, saying the complexity and
time-consuming research required to ascertain the disposition of assets
warranted the ruling.
The MCC administrators said in February they hoped to sell most of the
company's minor holdings outside the US within two months.
Time Warner, the US entertainment and media group, has agreed to buy
Maxwell's British publishing business, Macdonald and Co, for an undisclosed
price.
Mr John Gellene, a US lawyer for the administrators, gave no indication of
the disposition of MCC assets, but said in court that 'all parties have made
remarkable progress in setting a common agenda'.

FT  08 APR 92 / International Company News: Pan Am terminates route pact
with Delta
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KAREN ZAGOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PAN AM, the defunct US airline, has terminated its agreement to transfer its
Detroit-London route to Delta Air Lines, clearing the way for Pan Am to sell
the route to Northwest Airlines.
Pan Am said its action was based on a termination clause in the Pan Am-Delta
contract to transfer the route to Delta. Delta yesterday responded by asking
the US Department of Transportation to 'finalise its Show Cause Order and
issue certificate authority to Delta' to operate the route.
Delta and Northwest have been battling for the route for several months.
Delta had claimed it purchased the route as part of a package of Pan Am
assets, including Pan Am's East Coast Shuttle and remaining transatlantic
routes, it bought during the autumn.
Northwest, which has a hub in Detroit, has strongly contested Delta's
application.
Delta said it would continue to operate the service under temporary rights
granted by the department of transportation after Pan Am stopped operating
in December. 'This case has been one of the most - if not the most -
litigated route transfer proceedings in history,' Delta said. 'The public
interest requires prompt action.'
Pan Am said US bankruptcy court judge Cornelius Blackshear had denied
Delta's request for a temporary restraining order to block the contract
termination. Pan Am has also withdrawn its filing with the Department of
Transportation to transfer the route to Delta, and has filed a joint motion
with Northwest to transfer the route to Northwest.
In January, Pan Am brought a Dollars 2.5bn lawsuit against Delta, claiming
Delta had acted to assure that Pan Am failed. Delta has brought its own
counter suit against Pan Am.

<TEXT>
Tuskar Resources, the Dublin-based exploration company, yesterday announced
an agreement with Coplex which gives the Australian exploration company a 54
per cent interest in Tuskar's Rubiales and Piriri licences in Colombia,
writes Tim Coone.
In return Tuskar will receive up to 10m Coplex ordinary shares.
Last week Coplex announced a surprise IPounds 4.67m (Pounds 4.36m)
share-exchange bid for Tuskar which is expected to go ahead.
Tuskar said that the purpose of the agreement was to secure drilling
licences in the two fields which are due to expire in June. Last February Mr
Neil O'Donoghue, chairman, announced that Tuskar was unable to raise the
finance necessary to complete its drilling programme.
Under the new deal, Coplex will fund the obligatory drilling programme in
the two fields to meet the requirements specified by Ecopetrol, the
Colombian state petroleum company, which will require some IPounds 3m and
will secure the licences until June 1994.

WATERFORD Wedgwood, the Dublin-based crystal and ceramics group, reported a
pre-tax loss of IPounds 2.7m (Pounds 2.5m) for the 1991 year.
The previous year's deficit was was IPounds 21.4m.
Operating profits showed a 9 per cent decline to IPounds 9.1m (IPounds 10m).
The outcome was helped by a halving of the interest charge to IPounds 6.5m
(IPounds 13m) and lower exceptionals of IPounds 5.3m (IPounds 18.4m).
Without the exceptional item this year, relating to 'initiatives taking
place in late 1991 and 1992 to reduce manufacturing costs' the group would
have broken even.
Waterford Crystal cut operating losses to IPounds 1.2m (IPounds 4.8m) on
turnover of IPounds 73m (IPounds 76.7m).
Operating profits in the Wedgwood division fell to IPounds 10.3m (IPounds
14.8m) on turnover of IPounds 219.1m (IPounds 231.2m).
Mr Richard Barnes, chief financial officer, said that the exceptional item
has been split 60:40 between the Wedgwood and Waterford divisions.
At Wedgwood it related to the closure of 'three ancient plants' and their
consolidation into other factories which would be completed by May, and 'a
small number of redundancies in the first half of 1992'.
The Waterford division exceptional was a provision for redundancies during
1992.
Group turnover fell 5 per cent to IPounds 292.1m (IPounds 307.9m). The
recession and the Gulf war were blamed for a 13 per cent drop in sales
volume.
Losses per share amounted to 0.73p, against 4.29p last time, close to market
predictions.

recession and acquired two dealerships towards the year-end.
An unchanged final dividend of 4p is proposed to maintain the total at

Pittencrieff, the Edinburgh-based oil and gas and communications company,

The communications business contributed 55 per cent to turnover and 40 per

The directors believed that, in due course, the mobile communications
business should establish itself as a major corporation in its own right and
as a consequence, a number of options including demerger of the oil and gas
business were being considered.
Group turnover for the year almost doubled to Pounds 10.2m. Earnings emerged

Earnings per share were 3.79p (4.04p). A final of 1.01p makes a total of
1.46p (1.39p).

FT  08 APR 92 / UK Company News: Row flares over rise in charge for debit
card
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY and DAVID BARCHARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ROW between banks and retailers over charges for debit and credit cards
flared yesterday when Sir Ian MacLaurin declared he was 'very, very unhappy'
about proposed increases.
He used stronger language in saying that the British Retail Association was
aiming to take a firm line in negotiations with the banks.
Mr David Malpas said the banks had behaved disgracefully. The group had
invested up to Pounds 30m in the equipment to take debit cards, he said,
because the banks had decided it would be easier to handle transactions
electronically rather than using cheques.
When customers pay by debit card the money is electronically transferred
from their bank account to the retailer's account.
Mr Malpas said the banks were now 'hiking up charges to an unsupportable
level'. Banks and retailers had agreed that the charge for debit cards would
be no more than for cheque processing, about 4p to 5p a transaction across
the industry. The banks were looking to charge retailers twice that for
handling a transaction on Switch, the electronic-only debit card system, he
said.
Switch accused the retailers of wanting a Rolls Royce service for the cost
of a Mini.
'Switch was costly to develop, costing over Pounds 100m to set up. We did
tell many of the retailers that the prices we offered during the start up
period were initial pricing but they seem to have been taken by surprise
that rates have finally had to go up,' Mr Tim Green, managing director of
Switch, the largest UK debit card scheme, said.
Mr Green conceded that the charges for Switch were now higher than those for
cheques.
'We admit that at present Switch's charges are a few pence more than the
price of cheque collection. But it is too good a service for the retailers
to pass over.'
Barclays said that the flat charge on each Visa debit card transaction went
up from 10.5p to 12p two months ago, though it was still well below the
17.5p charged in 1987 when the card was launched.
Tesco said that the banks had also unilaterally demanded an increase in fees
for credit card transactions.
Mr Malpas said that about 40 per cent of Tesco's sales were paid for by
credit or debit cards. He said customers liked using the debit cards and
their usage had grown rapidly.

FT  08 APR 92 / O&amp;Y hits hurdle in plan to pay debt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
OLYMPIA &amp; YORK, the debt- burdened property developer, is struggling to find
a buyer for a 36-storey Toronto office building it needs to sell to fund
overdue debt obligations.
Problems in raising funds from Exchange Tower, which houses O&amp;Y's head
office and the Toronto Stock Exchange, mirror a nervousness in financial
markets this week over O&amp;Y's inability to meet payments on its CDollars 20bn
(Pounds 9.7bn) debt.
Share prices of Canadian banks with a large exposure to O&amp;Y, as well as
Trizec, the property developer in which O&amp;Y has a 35 per cent interest, fell
to their lowest in a year in Toronto yesterday.
In addition, an O&amp;Y spokesman confirmed the company had failed to make
interest payments on a USDollars 800m (Pounds 458.3m) Eurobond secured by
one of the buildings in Manhattan's World Financial Centre. Last week, O&amp;Y
failed to make a principal payment on a CDollars 450m loan to finance
construction of Toronto's 68-storey Scotia Plaza.
A Toronto property financier said yesterday O&amp;Y has been involved in 'a fair
bit of activity' to line up a Canadian or foreign buyer for Exchange Tower.
O&amp;Y has been trying to sell Exchange Tower to raise funds to redeem a
CDollars 300m commercial paper programme secured by the building. About
CDollars 150m to CDollars 200m of the paper is still outstanding. No
payments have been made in recent weeks.
The company last week redeemed principal plus accrued interest on a second
CP programme following the receipt of funds from the sale of its controlling
interest in Interprovincial PipeLine of Calgary.
Among the options for Exchange Tower are a takeover by some O&amp;Y bank lenders
until another buyer can be found, and a sale-leaseback arrangement under
which O&amp;Y would regain ownership once its financial condition improves.
The search for a buyer is complicated by the steep fall in Toronto property
prices in the past two years. One property analyst said any pension fund or
bank which bought Exchange Tower at a depressed price faced having to write
down the value of its other property holdings.
He said only a handful of Canadian institutions had the resources to buy
Exchange Tower, while foreign investors were more interested in cheaper
buildings in US cities such as Houston and Dallas.

FT  08 APR 92 / Impatient GM board flexes its muscles: The humbling of
Robert Stempel
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'YOU'VE just got to have the patience to stay with me,' declared Mr Robert
Stempel, the embattled chairman of General Motors, when he recently pointed
out that reviving the ailing car manufacturer would take quite some time.
But this week the board sent him a powerful message that its patience is
wearing mighty thin. Non-executive directors, in an extraordinary display of
muscle-flexing, forced a shake-up of GM's senior management.
It has humbled Mr Stempel by removing him as chairman of GM's key executive
committee, which oversees the company between board meetings. He has been
replaced by Mr John Smale, a non-executive director who was formerly head of
Procter &amp; Gamble, the consumer products group, and appears to have played a
key role in prompting the boardroom mutiny.
It has also demoted Mr Lloyd Reuss, the chairman's much-criticised
right-hand man, who has been replaced as group president by Mr John Smith,
the head of international operations. Less than two months ago, amid
persistent speculation that Mr Reuss's star was waning, Mr Stempel told a
news conference: 'Lloyd's my guy.'
Mr Stempel, 58, remains as chairman of the group, but the board has
apparently put him on notice that he will have to act much more toughly and
decisively to keep the position over the long term.
'Regaining profitability requires a more aggressive management approach to
remove excess costs,' it pointedly declared in a statement after the Monday
board meeting which pushed the upheaval through.
Yesterday Wall Street gave its own verdict on the changes, marking the
company's shares up Dollars 1 1/4 to close ar Dollars 38 in the hope that
the new team will move decisively to solve the group's chronic problems in
North America, where its automotive operations had an operating loss of
Dollars 7bn (Pounds 4bn) in 1991.
Over the next few weeks the company is expected to announce further large
first-quarter losses, when smaller Detroit rivals Chrysler and Ford may have
operated profitably.
All of the Big Three US car manufacturers have been hit by recession, which
has cut demand for vehicles, and increased supply, thanks to the growing
output from Japanese car plants in North America. But both Ford and Chrysler
have moved more aggressively than GM over the past few years to streamline
their manufacturing efficiency.
When Mr Stempel replaced Mr Roger Smith, GM's controversial and
authoritarian chairman in 1990, his appointment was seen as a big
opportunity for the bureaucratically hidebound giant to reverse the slide in
its US car market share, which has dipped from 47 per cent at the start of
the 1980s to 35 per cent now.
Mr Stempel, who has an imposing 6ft 4in frame and booming voice, was hailed
as an engineer who would inject excitement into the company's range and a
collegiate leader who would inject a sense of purpose into management and
bite the bullet on much-needed plant closures.
He has done much in each of these areas, but he has not done enough, fast
enough. Critics say he is a man who prefers evolution when market forces are
demanding a revolution.
Last December, after prodding from the board, he did announce plans for a
restructuring, with more than 70,000 job losses and the closure of 21 plants
over the next few years. The company is also reorganising its North American
management structure, which will change the cumbersome system imposed by Mr
Roger Smith in 1984.
This is an extremely delicate task - the 1984 upheaval threw the company
into months of turmoil - and the man responsible for overseeing the change
has up to now been Mr Reuss, who had ultimate charge of GM's North American
car operations. Mr Reuss, aged 55, who tends to dress in three-piece suits
and monogrammed shirts, cuts a distinctly provincial Middle American figure.
He has long been out of favour with the board.
When Mr Stempel became chairman, the board wanted him to appoint Mr Jack
Smith as president, but he insisted on Mr Reuss, his longtime sidekick and
one-time rival for the top job. When the appointment was announced inside
GM, some white collar workers jeered.
Critics said the appointment was a classic example of what was wrong at GM,
with an inbred corporate culture and bureaucratic dead hand encouraging
croneyism and rewarding employees for long service rather than performance.
This week the board said enough was enough. Mr Reuss is being shunted off to
head a rag-bag of activities, including the development of new cars. Mr Jack
Smith, his replacement, is a very different type of manager. Aged 54 - he
celebrated his birthday on Monday  - he is an approachable, down-to-earth
man who was born in New England and rose through the GM ranks on the
financial side.
But he really made his name in Europe in the mid-1980s, when he took charge
of GM's operations and played a key role in turning what had been a heavy
lossmaker into the most profitable of the six big European volume car
manufacturers. Key ingredients included strong products, flexible factory
practices - and a lack of strong Japanese competition.
Although Mr Smith always stresses that the European turnround was a joint
effort which took a decade, the board is clearly hoping he can work similar
effects in the US. In Monday's statement it pointedly said the appointments
would 'promote the adoption of best practices throughout the corporation,
such as the operating techniques which have proved so successful for GM's
international oper-ations'.
But GM in the US is an infinitely more complicated animal than in Europe,
and it is questionable how rapidly Mr Smith can get to grips with the
immense task.
A huge question mark also hangs over the relationship between Mr Stempel and
Mr Smale in the running of the business. Mr Smale, who has been on the GM
board for a decade, is credited with turning Procter &amp; Gamble in the 1980s
from a sluggish giant into an aggressive, financially successful business.
He knows what it takes to turn a complacent bureaucracy around. But will
what he knows coincide with what Mr Stempel thinks? And, if not, which voice
will prevail?

FT  08 APR 92 / WMI raises Pounds 438m from global shareoffering
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WASTE Management Inter-national yesterday raised Pounds 438m from the
international offer and placing of 20 per cent of its shares, valuing the
group at just over Pounds 2.2bn. After expenses and underwriting
commissions, Pounds 33m, or 7.5 per cent of the total raised, net proceeds
came to Pounds 405m.
Shares in the UK were placed at the slightly lower than expected price of
585p, against an indicated range of 530-645p. The shares rose 20p in trading
to close at 605p.
Merrill Lynch, global co-ordinator, said the success of the multi-tranche
deal, the first of its kind in this country, would act as a benchmark for
further international equity offerings, such as Guinness Peat Aviation,
which is to be floated in June.
The pricing was described by Merrill Lynch as having been led by
institutions in the US, where Waste Management Incorporated, the parent
company, is based.
The offering of Waste Management International's shares involves a placing
of 26.2m shares in the UK market; an offer for sale of 30m shares in the US,
packaged as 15m American depository shares; and an offer of 18.7m shares in
other markets.
In New York, the shares were priced at Dollars 20.4, implying a price of
Dollars 10.2 for each share in the international offering. An adviser for
the group said it was pleased with the response in spite of some criticism
that the shares had been priced too high. The shares are now trading on a
multiple of 32 times the pro-forma 1991 earnings per share.

FT  08 APR 92 / Virani quits as Control Securities chairman
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR NAZMU VIRANI, who is charged with fraud in connection with the collapsed
Bank of Credit and Commerce International, yesterday announced he would quit
as chairman and chief executive of Control Securities.
Mr Virani's partial resignation - he will remain a director of the company
on a full chairman's salary, of Pounds 250,000 according to last year's
accounts - paves the way for a relisting of the pubs and property group,
which has been suspended since October at 16 1/2 p.
The Stock Exchange said a relisting would now depend on it receiving
information relating to the future structure of Control's board. It has been
suggested that Mr Virani, who was granted Pounds 1.25m bail at City of
London courts yesterday, may resign as a director at a future date. He will
be replaced by non-executive director Mr Sydney Robin, who will become
acting executive chairman until Control appoints a permanent replacement.
Control yesterday stressed that the charges against Mr Virani were in no way
connected to the company. 'The SFO have confirmed that Control is not under
investigation,' a statement read.

FT  08 APR 92 / PLO crisis talks as Arafat is reported missing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY WALKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LEADERS of the Palestine Liberation Organisation called crisis talks last
night after an aircraft carrying Mr Yassir Arafat, the PLO's veteran leader,
was reported missing over the Libyan desert.
The aircraft, flying Mr Arafat from Sudan, disappeared from radar screens
during bad weather, according to the Libyan newsagency Jana.
Leaders of Mr Arafat's mainstream Fatah faction of the PLO held emergency
talks at their headquarters in Tunis to assess the implications. Although Mr
Arafat is unpredictable and elusive, PLO leaders were seriously concerned at
the lengthy loss of contact.
There was no immediate suggestion that the PLO leader had fallen victim to
an attack.
Libya's newsagency said Mr Arafat's aircraft disappeared about 70 miles from
the village of Sarra in the country's south-eastern desert. It vanished from
radar screens at 8.45 pm local time. Libyan radio quoted civil aviation
officials as saying that Al Kofra airport in Tripoli lost contact with the
aircraft due to 'bad weather conditions'.
The Libyans called for help from the International Red Cross, civil aviation
organisations and bodies operating international satellites and weather
stations.
A sandstorm, common for this time of the year in the desert regions of the
Middle East, was reported in the area where Mr Arafat's aircraft
disappeared.
Mr Arafat, who has been the PLO chairman since 1969, has survived a number
of attempts by the Israelis and others to eliminate him. At this stage, PLO
officials are not talking about foul play, but nor are they ruling out the
possibility of some interference with the PLO chairman's aircraft.
In Tunis, Mr Arafat's colleagues, used to his sudden disappearances and
reappearances, were at first sceptical of reports that his aircraft might
have gone down, but as the evening wore on without news of his whereabouts
their alarm increased.
The PLO leader was reported to be travelling with his usual complement of
bodyguards, secretaries and personal assistants. It was not clear whether
his new wife, Suha, was also on board, but she has travelled with him
constantly in recent months.
Among Fatah faction chiefs meeting in Tunis to discuss the latest apparent
twist in the PLO's fortunes were Mahmoud Abbas and Farouk Khaddoumi, along
with the PLO ambassador in Tunis, Hakem Belawi.
Mr Abbas, whose nom de guerre is Abu Mazen and who is regarded as a
moderate, has been spoken of as a possible successor in the event that
anything happened to Mr Arafat, who was 62 last August.
In Tunis, a PLO official said it was premature to speculate about a
successor.

FT  08 APR 92 / Plan for largest union agreed: Nalgo, Nupe and Cohse would
create 1.4m-strong body
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FINISHING touches will today be put to a plan which would create
Britain's largest, and potentially most influential, trade union.
At the end of an election campaign in which the Conservative party has tried
to win votes over the issue of trade union power, Nalgo, Nupe and Cohse
announced yesterday that their executives had agreed to the proposals for a
1.4m-strong public sector union to be called Unison.
The endorsement means members are likely to accept the plans later this
year.
Employers believe Unison will give workers in sectors including local
government and the health service greater power in collective bargaining.
In the final two days of the election campaign the Conservatives may seek to
make capital by claiming that the new union would exercise a stronger
influence on a Labour government than would the three organisations acting
independently.
Although Unison would not be formed until July next year, it is likely that
the three unions will seek to co-ordinate their policies on a range of
issues, including public sector pay.
The Labour party has said it will seek fairer and more rational ways of
determining public sector pay and halt the deterioration of pay and
conditions for many public sector workers. However, policies still to be
decided include the need, if any, to reform pay determination mechanisms,
and whether to proceed with Tory plans to extend performance pay schemes
opposed by unions.
As Nupe general secretary, Mr Rodney Bickerstaffe was influential in the
Labour leadership's adoption of plans for a minimum wage, a controversial
issue in the election.
Under the merger plans Mr Bickerstaffe, 47, is likely to be sole general
secretary from 1995. Initially he will be one of three joint general
secretaries, with Mr Hector MacKenzie of Cohse, and Mr Alan Jinkinson, of
Nalgo, who will act as a 'first among equals' until he retires in three
years time. The unions' three executives have indicated they will support Mr
Bickerstaffe in the election to succeed Mr Jinkinson, 57.
The merger plans open up the possibility that more members will affiliate to
Labour through the union. Although Nupe and Cohse are affiliated to the
party, Nalgo is not. The proposals would mean that, after 1995, all members
would be able to contribute to a general political fund or a fund used for
Labour party affiliations, or neither.
Union leaders are confident members will vote for the merger but opposition
remains. Some Nalgo members are concerned about a potential clash of
cultures between their predominantly white collar union and what they see as
the mainly blue collar Nupe and Cohse.
However, at Monday's Nalgo executive meeting only a handful of the 75
members voted against the document.

FT  08 APR 92 / Clinton wins comfortably in critical New York primary
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GOVERNOR Bill Clinton of Arkansas won a critical victory in New York's
Democratic primary early today, fending off a fierce challenge from Mr Jerry
Brown, his rival for the party's presidential nomination.
Early returns and exit polls showed Mr Clinton winning the New York primary
by a comfortable margin - although with much less than an outright majority
 -and also winning a sizeable victory in the much smaller Kansas primary.
The Wisconsin primary appeared to be much closer, although preliminary
estimates gave Mr Clinton the edge there too.
In the Republican primaries, President George Bush faced no contest in New
York, where Mr Patrick Buchanan, his right-wing challenger, was excluded
from the ballot paper, and won comfortably in Kansas and Wisconsin.
The campaign in New York had been brutally fought. Tabloid newspapers
attacked Governor Clinton's character with a savagery compounded by New
York's traditional prejudice against southerners, before turning their wrath
on Mr Brown, former governor of California.
After the Illinois and Michigan primaries on March 17, Governor Clinton had
appeared assured of a smooth ride towards winning the Democratic nomination
at the party convention in July.
But Mr Paul Tsongas's decision to suspend his candidacy threw Mr Clinton
into a duel with Mr Brown, whose slash-and-burn campaigning style was
fuelled by a victory in Connecticut's primary two weeks ago.
Despite suspending his campaign, Mr Tsongas attracted a sizeable vote in New
York and last night was considering whether to revive his candidacy.
The swirling fortunes of the campaign - and especially Governor Clinton's
travails over whether and where he smoked marijuana, and whether he dodged
the Vietnam war draft - have encouraged Washington pundits and Democratic
party officials to discuss scenarios for introducing another candidate, such
as Senator Lloyd Bentsen of Texas or Senator Al Gore of Tennessee. But these
wishful scenarios are sketched by the same people who drew up the party
rules that make a late candidacy all but impossible.
Even before yesterday's primaries, Mr Clinton had won 1,082 of the 4,288
delegates who will attend the party nominating convention in New York, far
ahead of Mr Brown's 166 delegates. The Arkansas governor seemed set to add
substantially to his total after yesterday's voting, in which another 362
delegates were at stake.
In Wisconsin, voters' favour had swung back and forth between the two
candidates, but neither man found much time to campaign in the state.
In Kansas, with 36 delegates at stake, Governor Clinton was the only
candidate to campaign.

FT  08 APR 92 / Observer: Include her Out
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It seems to Observer that the new edition of Cassell's Concise English
Dictionary is at risk of being handbagged.
Updated from the 1989 edition, the 1,664-page tome currently in manuscript
form contains definitions of recent additions to the English language
ranging from Cardboard City to Outing - not to mention Maggie Thatcher's
best known accessory re- designed for use as a transitive verb.
Cassell is also unwisely parading the fact that it is specially holding the
presses until after April 9 in order to be able to include an indispensable
extra appendix detailing a 'full listing of the new parliament'.
Questioned as to what conceivable use such a list would be in the event of
son of handbag's successors struggling for weeks and months to form a stable
government, Cassell gives the reply it presumably considers politically
correct (yes, that's in there too). 'That's just one of those things,' says
the spokesperson.

It may not be one of the world's great sporting events, but the 1992
National Tennis Championships of Cambodia have provided a heartwarming
spectacle for the two dozen people who turned up to watch.
For the first time in years, the handful of players still alive and in the
country after the genocide committed by the Khmer Rouge are competing with
plenty of new balls and without borrowing each other's ageing tennis
rackets, thanks to the sponsorship of Wilson Sporting Goods' Singaporean
operation.
Under UN guidance, Cambodia is slowly returning to normal after two decades
of civil war, but life is still pretty tough. 'There are not many of us
left,' is how one veteran of the Khmer Lawn Tennis Federation founded in the
1930s puts it. 'And you have to make economies even to buy a pair of socks.'
The singles players paid 200 riels - about 15p  - to enter the competition.
'Nobody was playing tennis after the Pol Pot period,' recalls Yi Sarun,
singles champion in 1974, the year before the Khmer Rouge overran the
capital. 'After 1984 people began to play again using old rackets and
makeshift nets.'
A few young players are on the rise, but it is a sad reflection of the
devastation endured by his country that this year's national champion - and
winner of a graphite racket and a can of tennis balls - is the self-same Yi
who won 18 years ago.

The word 'retirement' has just been given a whole new meaning by Midland
Bank. When Sir Kit McMahon gave up as its chairman and chief executive last
year, he said he was retiring. But his departure brought him more than the
customary gold fob watch and pension.
Midland's accounts show he was paid Pounds 489,187 'in respect of the
termination' of his service agreement and a further Pounds 60,813 was paid
into his pension scheme.
The bank says the payment was properly determined by a committee composed
entirely of non-executive directors and chaired by Sir Patrick Meaney, whose
services as a non-exec are in high demand among leading companies.
Moreover McMahon was 'retired early' and therefore compensation was quite in
order. It is an open secret in the City of London that the Bank of England
encouraged his departure, following the collapse of his hopes that Midland
would merge with Hongkong and Shanghai Bank.
Now, however, Midland is once again in talks with Hongkong and Shanghai,
which are expected to lead to the British bank being taken over. Curiously
there is no mention of these talks in the report and accounts - not quite
best corp- orate governance practice.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Successional goings-on at Dresdner Bank have been more than unusually
delphic this time round; the next chief executive has been named only days
after insurance giant Allianz's complicated shareholding links with
Germany's second bank finally provoked the cartel authorities to order a cut
in its stake.
The choice of 56-year-old Jurgen Sarrazin - who takes up the reins after the
1993 agm - has surprised many. At Dresdner since 1960, and now responsible
for international commercial banking, Sarrazin shares with his predecessor,
Wolfgang Roller, origins in the eastern state of Saxony - although the tall
polished banker displays less of the legendary Saxon striving ambition than
the physically less imposing Roller.
He has been labelled a compromise candidate, whose main offering seems to be
continuity. Younger and fresher alternatives might have been finance
director Bernd Voss, 52, or Bernhard Walter, 50, who has masterminded the
successful push into the east.
However much Dresdner protests that Allianz's shareholding confers on the
bank more, rather than less, independence, it seems it may have been rushed
into the question of succession by other events. The departure upstairs of
Roller, 62, to head the Dresdner supervisory board from May 1993 may not be
unconnected with the arrival this year of the steely Wolfgang Schieren -
Allianz supervisory board chief  - as a candidate for Dresdner's supervisory
board. Letting the matter ride might have helped Schieren inhabit the
position that is now securely Roller's.
The Dresdner/Allianz relationship was always drawn along by competition with
the numero uno of German banking, Deutsche. Being number two certainly has
its complications.

FT  08 APR 92 / Leading Article: How to pay top executives
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
IS IT poetic justice, or plain foolishness, that has caused Anglo-Saxon big
business to wait for an election year to shoot itself in the foot over the
sore subject of executive pay?
The degree of self-injury is greatest in America, where years of granting
astronomic pay packages to top managers, especially through stock options,
has culminated in action by the Securities and Exchange Commission. This, in
turn, has unleashed a spate of shareholder resolutions which, if passed,
would improve disclosure by such giants as IBM and Kodak, and curb the
incentive deals offered by Chrysler and others.
In Britain, the regular spring open season of attacks on top pay got off to
a resounding start late last month, when the recently privatised British Gas
revealed that its chairman had accepted a near-18 per cent rise last year,
at a time of stagnant profits.
The company's defence, that it must pay highly in an international market
for executives, was not well judged. Only where a company really does
operate in an international executive market, or when a particular
discipline such as marketing is in especially high demand, is such a
rationale valid.
Given the continued reluctance of most UK companies even to declare the
structure of their pay packages, it is not surprising that some now fear
regulatory action - on both sides of the Atlantic, and regardless of which
party is in power.
At present, only about one tenth of British companies even mention in their
annual reports whether any performance-related incentive is included in the
scanty remuneration figures which they report. A mere handful say whether
this is an annual bonus, a three-year bonus, or a longer-term scheme such as
stock options. Fewer still show how the package breaks down. Yet many
companies pay all three - and other perks besides.
Inadequate disclosure
The inadequacy of most companies' degree of disclosure is rammed home by the
readiness of a handful of leading companies - such as BOC, Grand
Metropolitan and this year BP - at least to summarise their arrangements.
It is not enough to tell companies to decide top pay packages through
remuneration committees consisting exclusively of non-executives. Yet this
is the recommendation handed down by ProNed, the non-executive organisation
backed by the Bank of England. If the Cadbury Committee on corporate
governance contents itself with proposing such a half-hearted course of
action, it will increase the threat of highly inappropriate government
regulation.
Performance indicator
Instead, companies should be required to disclose details of all existing
and proposed top pay packages to shareholders. This information should
include the types of performance indicator to which the package is linked
and - if the incentives are tied to corporate profit levels - whether they
will fall as sharply as they rise. The disclosure process should occur well
in advance of each annual general meeting, at which all packages should be
voted upon.
Meanwhile companies which want to extend best practice should do three
things. First, they should start to abandon the normal system of free stock
options in favour of a long-term incentive programme which fosters a real
sense of ownership - and the risk that goes with it. A new BP scheme is not
only tied to the company's competitive performance, but the 140 senior
managers who benefit from it also have to pay for a proportion of their
share-linked 'performance units'.
Second, companies should make a reality of their claims to share 'vision and
values' with their employees. Instead of having one set of generous
incentive programmes for the magic circle at the top, and a more stingy
system down below, they should extend many of the incentives lower down -
remembering that there is unlikely to be an international market for car
park attendants.
Finally, they should keep packages relatively simple. In the US many top
packages seem written intentionally to confuse everyone except the
beneficiary and the remuneration consultant. Such obfuscation gives
shareholders little chance to exercise their due right to approve or veto
the actions of management.

FT  08 APR 92 / Angry voice of the north
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
By becoming the biggest party in Milan, the second-biggest in northern Italy
and the fourth-largest nationwide, Mr Umberto Bossi's Lombard League is the
clear winner from the polls, writes Haig Simonian.
Yet, in spite of its rise to prominence with 55 newly elected deputies,
compared with one in the previous parliament, much about the League remains
shadowy.
Its policies are vague. As a protest movement, the bulk of its platform is
devoted to attacking the political establishment. Devolution for Italy's
rich north takes pride of place. 'An end to Roman robbers' and 'Closer to
Europe than to Rome' are two of the League's emotive slogans.
Fighting organised crime, the second part of the League's message, dovetails
conveniently with the first. The governing parties' growing dependence on
southern votes and their alleged links with criminal organisations play
strongly on traditional northern prejudices.
According to the League, the governing parties have habitually 'squandered'
hard-working and honest northern taxpayers' money on wasteful,
vote-gathering schemes in the south.
The League's message has struck a chord with a broad spectrum of voters in
the north. Although middle-class in the main, supporters of Mr Bossi range
from blue collar workers to successful private businessmen.
Support from industry, however, has been restricted to small and
medium-sized businesses. Although big business broadly approves of Mr
Bossi's calls for change, his populism has been hard for the country's
industrial barons to swallow.
The League's newly elected deputies are a diverse group. Mr Giancarlo
Pagliarini, elected to the senate, parliament's upper house, from the small
town of Treviglio, is an accountant. Mr Luigi Roveda, elected from nearby
Lecco, runs a small company.
The challenge now facing Mr Bossi is to prevent the movement from suffering
the fate of so many other protest groups and breaking apart under the strain
of electoral success and the need to devise coherent policies.
The party must also try to develop a stronger national appeal. Mr Bossi's
conception of a devolved Italy based on regional groupings in the north,
centre and south foundered on the poor results of the affiliated leagues in
central and southern Italy. Their minimal showing may explain why Mr Bossi
fell short of his target of 10 per cent of the national vote.
His biggest problem will be coping with success. Organisationally, the party
is stretched. Mr Bossi is its only figure of national standing and finances
are limited. The League will now have to build the apparatus of a large
political party.
Such an achievement will not be easy. As one sceptical party member,
emerging from his battered Peugeot, said last night. 'If someone gives me a
Mercedes, I have to know how to use it.' That is the test now facing Mr
Bossi.

FT  08 APR 92 / Arts: Life in the raw - Television
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER DUNKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Tuesdays are now bringing two more helpings of television fiction: Medics
from ITV at 9.00 and, the moment that finishes at 10.00, Resnick from BBC1.
The first is a series set in (perhaps you should sit down) . . . a hospital]
The second - do you have a tight hold on your hat?  - is about a police
detective. Where do television people find these astounding ideas?
Medics was launched last year and concentrated on the private lives of a
crowd of randy young doctors. Now it stars Tom Baker as a surgeon, an
'unorthodox' surgeon, naturally, who operates to music and delivers that
manic grin over his theatre mask - enough to knock out any patient without
benefit of anaesthetic. Charlie Resnick is, we are assured, 'an
unconventional police detective'. This means he lives on gherkin and mustard
sandwiches, listens to jazz and sees ghosts.
There is nothing strikingly bad about either series, indeed Resnick may
prove rather good. But if you want engrossing fiction you can get it from
books, cinema, radio and theatre, as well as television, and the material in
the older mass media is often impressive. But when it comes to non-fiction
of a certain sort - showing the world we live in  - television has the edge,
whether in current affairs or documentary programmes. Although much can be
achieved by books, magazines and newspapers, using print and photographs -
particularly if a predominantly abstract treatment is desired with more
analysis than illustration - television is nearly always superior when it is
a question of showing the public what is happening in some particular
sphere. However, it is important that the programme makers know exactly what
they are trying to do and which techniques they are going to use and, even
more crucial, that they tell us. Astonishingly often, they fail in all of
this and, worse, pick the wrong technique in the first place.
Last week's Cutting Edge on Channel 4 was a classic example. The makers
wanted to show what goes on at Summerhill, the school started 70 years ago
by AS Neill, who maintained that children were naturally good, not naturally
bad; it took adults to teach children to lie. Everyone, whether child or
adult, has an equal vote in making the rules, and lessons are voluntary. The
trouble with the programme was that, being a 'fly on the wall' study, it
found no means of conveying the sort of information which most viewers
consider essential. Was this a private school? If so, what were the fees?
Why were so many of the children American or Japanese? Is 90 per cent of
school time really occupied by union-style meetings dominated by the
show-offs, or was that simply what most interested the film makers? How many
children are there? What are their ages? How many staff? How many of the
children take exams? Which ones? What is the success rate?
The advantages of verite techniques are greatly over-rated and involve much
hypocrisy, since the makers shape the end-product by their editing decisions
as surely as any conventional programme-maker does. Meanwhile they
relinquish the advantages of reporter, script, graphics, voice-over, and so
on. 'Summerhill at 70' was a particularly striking example.
Still, the irony is that reactions to the programme have been restricted
almost entirely to anger about a boy with a machete, seen chasing and
killing a rabbit which, it seems, was suffering from myxomatosis. The
programme's one considerable achievement was in showing how the libertarian
nature of Summerhill illustrates that the child is indeed father of the man,
how the desire to hunt and kill animals, whether rabbits, fish, or foxes,
all begins in childhood; how the possession of weapons and their use in
threats and for domination are not peculiar to the Saddam Husseins or
Margaret Thatchers of this world but also start in childhood. Yet what was
the main reaction to the programme? Shock and outrage - what a disgraceful
school where boys can kill ickle bunny-wunnies.
Last week's QED also raised more questions than it answered. First, what
does the return of the badly burned Simon Weston to the Falkland Islands,
and his meeting with the pilot who led the attack on the Galahad, have to do
with popular science, which we are told is QED's subject? And who financed
the trip? No doubt many servicemen over the years have had a yen to meet
their former enemies, but few would spend thousands of pounds to do it.
It would be one thing for Weston to move heaven and earth to return to
Argentina and find the man responsible for his wounds (however questionable,
as both were acting under orders and Weston would doubtless have inflicted
similar damage if he could) and for television to follow along behind. It is
something else entirely if it was the bright idea of some broadcaster who
fixed it all up, paid for it, and then filmed it. Of course viewers are not
told that sort of thing.
Worst of all, however, was a 95-minute 'documentary' called 'My Crasy Life'
in BBC2's Fine Cut series, yet another programme about Los Angeles street
gangs. As so often, we were told nothing about the attitudes, aims, or
techniques of the programme-makers, and the whole thing conveyed a
distinctly odd feeling. It was not merely that the slang and pronunciation
left most of us in need of subtitles, it was something more profound. The
'rap' sessions did not look spontaneous but as though they had been
semi-professionally produced, and events such as the stealing of the wallet
from the white teenager felt staged.
Reference to the press release brings enlightenment: the programme was
'scripted, edited, lit, acted and directed along fictional lines', the
producers 'threw away the rule book, giving the gang members access to the
film making process', it was 'primarily constructed from re-enacted scenes',
the makers decided to shoot in a 'cool style' which allowed 'respect to the
gangster'.
As that last quotation suggests, it is becoming dangerously fashionable for
makers of programmes, fiction and non-fiction, to indicate that they are
unable to tell right from wrong. That aside, there is nothing so dreadful
about the producers' techniques providing the viewers are told, but of
course they were not.
So, contrary to the claim above, are there no good non-fiction programmes
these days? There are, of course, though current affairs series are at
present dominated to an absurd degree by the election campaign.
There was, however, one excellent documentary last week which proved that
there are new subjects under the sun and that conventional methods can still
be extraordinarily effective. 'The Story Of Elisabeth Nietzsche' in BBC2's
Timewatch slot told the astonishing tale of how, a century ago, Friedrich
Nietzsche's sister started a racially-pure colony in the depths of the
Paraguayan jungle.
The descendants are still there today and the programme made good use of a
visit. Tonight the second in this pair of programmes promises to explore
Elisabeth Nietzsche's influence on Mussolini and Hitler, using material made
available recently by the collapse of East Germany.
In the end it is not technique that matters so much in non-fiction
programmes, but the dedication of the programme maker, ironclad integrity,
and above all a willingness to come clean with the viewer.

FT  08 APR 92 / Arts: Back up the hearse
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The full title of William Gaminara's first play is Back up the hearse and
let them sniff the flowers, a phrase familiar to those high pressure
door-to-door salesmen who can sell steak tartare to vegans, but obscure to
their victims. It means frightening someone into buying.
Gary (Paul Bown) heads the local branch of Virgin Waters, bringing the
dubious benefits of an expensive water filtering system to doubtful
householders. In his team are two stars, the current champion salesman Steve
(excellently played by Danny Webb), who could, and would, sell his granny to
the white slavers, and Brian (James Purefoy), who is hitting the households
hard and is on target to snatch from Steve the month's incentive prize
(unbelievably, it's a colour TV).
Then there are Andy (Wilbert Johnson) and Angie (Debra Gillet), who have yet
to make their first sale. The duplicitous office manager is Sharon (Lesley
Dunlop). It is a world made for drama, as the sales team humiliate potential
customers and themselves - in a strong scene Brian talks open a closed door
by raising the spectre of a sick child if the mother does not buy a filter,
while Andy allows himself to be sexually assaulted to make his first sale.
But (groan, groan) it is, of course, also a metaphor for Thatcher's Britain.
Suddenly, as Steve clinches a sale to an impoverished couple, he relents,
and tears up the contract. He's been struck by an attack of conscience. We
soon find out why. Before discovering the joys of cut-and-thrust
competition, he was an enthusiastic Trotskyite. His half-brother Des
(Christopher Fairbank), who suffers from a wasting disease, still is.
In an ending to warm Stalin's heart, and the fade-out for innumerable
propaganda movies, Gary lies beaten up and broken in the arms of Des,
murmuring 'Is there really nothing else?' To be answered with a reassuring
'Of course, there is'.
Until imposing his politically correct Hampstead ending, Gaminara's play
grips and convinces. As an exploration of human weakness - all the
characters but Sharon crack up in one way or another - and human
exploitation (the sales team trample on each other as vigorously as they
batter the customers) it is spot-on. John Dove directs a splendid cast
around Robert Jones' adaptable stage with great conviction and gives us one
of the most frightening fight scenes I have ever witnessed.
At the Hampstead Theatre until May 9

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Andy Fraser is gleeful about his new role as managing director of the
advertising agency Collett Dickenson Pearce. Having spent the last 11 years
with Saatchi and Saatchi, 41-year-old Fraser thought it was time for a
change. And nowhere better to head towards than CDP, where his Far East
experience will come in useful - and where the Japanese ad giant Dentsu has
43 per cent.
A Sussex university graduate in English and American studies, Kuala
Lumpur-born Fraser spent four years in Thailand - where he arrived in 1976 -
to take over as head of McCann Erickson's office and make his mark as one of
their youngest ever managers. He speaks the musical Thai language
'reasonably', some achievement in view of his admission that he is
'tone-deaf'.
Fraser is one of a handful of key Saatchi executives who have departed in
recent months, though he goes without acrimony - 'I'll never have a word
said against them'.

FT  08 APR 92 / Business and the Environment: Sticking a neck out to save
the crane - The competition for land between rice farmers and
conservationists in Vietnam
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HILARY DE BOERR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The eastern Sarus crane, a tall grey bird with a brilliant red neck, can
live for more than 80 years and mates for life. In Vietnam, it is a symbol
of eternity, carrying man's spirit to heaven. Nevertheless, the creature is
fighting for its life as farmers and conservationists compete for the land
on which it feeds.
Until seven years ago, the Sarus was feared lost to south-east Asia. Land
development, the ravages of war in Indo China and hunting left no wild Sarus
alive in China, Thailand and the Philippines. Its status was questionable in
Burma, Laos and Cambodia.
Then in 1985, ornithologists discovered a group of the cranes in Dong Thap
province in south-west Vietnam. The discovery has moved environmental
matters up the political agenda in a country preoccu-pied with post-war
economic development. Dong Thap province, bordering Cambodia, has thus
become the focus of worldwide attention. The International Crane Foundation,
based in Baraboo, Wisconsin, has invested hundreds of thousands of dollars
on field research to save the crane.
A nature reserve called Tram Chim (meaning bird swamp) has been set up to
protect the birds' feeding ground, with a field centre financed by German
conservationists. Vietnamese conservationists and authorities have devoted
efforts to preserving the natural habitat.
The problem is that the land comprising the 9,000-hectare nature reserve is
very much in demand. Thousands of impoverished farmers are being moved to
the region's wetlands to relieve population pressures elsewhere in the
country. The land, with poor growing soil that is highly acidic, can produce
up to three rice crops a year. The more land a farmer has, the better his
chances of making a living.
George Archibald, director of ICF, spends about one month a year at the
reserve to oversee its development and protect incursions by the farmers.
'The reserve is under pressure because the local people would like to turn
the whole area into one big rice field, cutting down all the trees. That's
what we are battling against,' he says.
His task has been to heighten the local people's awareness of the importance
of the crane. Through Earthwatch, the environmental charity, Archibald
brings paying volunteers from abroad to help him with his field research,
including visiting villages and local schools to educate people about the
birds.
The fact that the volunteers - mostly American  - pay a lot of money to join
the Earthwatch team does not escape the notice of the Vietnamese government.
Nguyen Quyen Sinh, general director of Vietnam National Tourism Corp, the
government body responsible for tourism, told this year's group of
international volunteers that he would ask the prime minister, Vo Van Kiet,
to make the reserve into a national park.
Archibald believes there is great potential for ecotourism in the area - for
example, bird-watching holidays. Tourism in Vietnam remains underdeveloped,
with general tourism approved by the government only five years ago.
Agriculture is the mainstay of the country's economy, employing about 80 per
cent of the workforce. Last year 350,000 tourists and businessmen visited
Vietnam, but more infrastructure development is necessary before the market
grows significantly.
In the meantime, local farmers are concerned only with feeding their
families. Conservationists are therefore pinning their hopes on finding
alternative sources of income for the Dong Thap area.
Le Dien Duc, co-ordinator of the wetlands and water birds working group at
the University of Hanoi, believes forestry might be the answer. The wetlands
area is home to the Melaleuca, a valuable tree that withstands rot and is
used in the construction of house foundations, dykes, dams and furniture.
Its oil has medicinal value, its flowers are used for honey, and the
wetlands where the trees grow harbour commercially valuable fish.
Melaleuca forests used to cover 250,000 hectares in the Mekong delta before
the Vietnam war, and during the war were home to the Communist-backed Viet
Cong. The US army sprayed toxic chemicals, bombed and napalmed the area and
dug drainage canals to kill the forests. After the country's reunification
in 1976,farmers continued the deforestation, adding drainage canals to
create rice fields. Trees have since been planted but there are still only
116,000 hectares of Melaleuca growing in the area.
Duc says such forests would help to minimise the damage caused by storms in
the rainy season - when whole areas, including houses, can be under water.
The trees help to improve the quality of the soil over time by preventing
acidification. They also filter pollutants from underground water. 'It's our
solution to help the local people live in harmony with the environment,' he
says.
Farmers have rejected Melaleuca forestry in the past because of the
five-year delay before timber harvesting is possible. Duc believes that with
financial and technological support - most likely from international
organisations and foreign governments - the local people could learn to
restore and manage the forests profitably.

FT  08 APR 92 / Labour plans new regime for auditors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LABOUR intends to remove the accountancy institutes' self-regulatory powers
over auditors if it comes to power, it emerged yesterday.
In an apparent toughening of her previous position, Ms Marjorie Mowlam,
Labour's voice on City affairs, said Labour planned to transfer auditing
regulation to an independent body. 'We think the case is very strong for
independence,' she said.
The accountancy institutes for England and Wales, Scotland, Northern Ireland
and the Irish Republic have been responsible for monitoring and regulating
nearly 10,000 accountants who are registered as auditors since the system
was set up by the Department of Trade and Industry last year.
Ms Mowlam's statement corroborates a document circulated to prospective
parliamentary candidates by her office some months ago which included a
proposal to regulate auditors independently of the professional institutes.
She said there was a common perception that the institutes were not
independent but acted more as trade associations. 'I don't believe their
track record suggests the kind of independence we would like to see,' she
said.
She added that she would not take any action until the end of this year,
when the first annual report on audit regulation will be submitted to the
DTI by the institutes.
One possible body to take over the regulatory function is the Accounting
Standards Board, but Ms Mowlam cautioned that it also required greater
openness in decision-making and wider representation on its board. The
Standards Board is funded and staffed by accountants.
News of the proposals came as a surprise to the professional institutes
yesterday. They maintain that self-regulation by accountants is the most
effective way to police auditors.
Mr Andrew Colquhoun, of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England
and Wales, said: 'We need a chance to demonstrate that the new regulation
system is working before anyone pulls up the plant by the roots.'
Mr Robin Leigh-Pemberton, governor of the Bank of England, last night called
for greater involvement by investors, brokers and analysts in the work of
the Accounting Standards Board and the Auditing Practices Board to help
raise the standards of corporate reporting.
Recent company failures had highlighted weaknesses in company accounts but
the accounts should not be 'the beginning and end of assessing a company's
position,' he said.

FT  08 APR 92 / Delay to MCC pension payments
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEARLY 1,000 pensioners of Maxwell Communication Corporation will have their
next pension payment delayed for an indefinite period while the High Court
decides how much money liquidators may pass to the pension scheme.
Law Debenture Corporation, trustees for the MCC pension scheme, said
yesterday that payments to pensioners since the company's collapse have now
exhausted all the scheme's assets.
The MCC scheme is entitled to a share of assets now controlled by Robson
Rhodes, the liquidators of Bishopsgate Investment Management, which acted as
fund manager to five companies controlled by the late Robert Maxwell.
However, the Court must decide how to allocate those assets among five
different pension schemes.
While the Common Investment Fund, the assets of all the pension funds of the
Maxwell company pension schemes, should have held Pounds 411m in assets,
liquidators have been able to recover only Pounds 111m. Law Debenture and
Robson Rhodes will ask the court to allow the administrators to provide a
loan to the pension fund to pay the pensioners.
Law Debenture also said yesterday it had successfully petitioned for a court
hearing to establish the pension scheme's role as a creditor of the company
 -a move initially opposed by Price Waterhouse, administrators to MCC.
Creditor status would enable the pension scheme to benefit from any
liquidation of MCC assets and reduce funds available to pay bank and other
MCC creditors.

FT  08 APR 92 / Bail for Virani set at Pounds 1.25m by magistrates

<TEXT>
MR NAZMU VIRANI, former chairman and chief executive of the property and
pubs group Control Securities, who is charged with fraud in connection with
the collapsed Bank of Credit and Commerce International, was freed on Pounds
1.25m bail yesterday.
Mr Virani, who is accused of a false-accounting conspiracy, had been in
custody since being refused bail on his first court appearance on March 30.
Yesterday he was remanded on conditional bail until July 7.
Magistrates at City of London courts refused to accept Mr Virani's two
sisters-in-law as sureties for Pounds 500,000 each after hearing that their
only assets were their homes.
Mr Anthony Scrivener QC, for Mr Virani, protested, saying the police and the
Serious Fraud Office had agreed that Mrs Aneeta Virani, whose London house
is valued at Pounds 750,000, and Mrs Aisha Virani, who owns a house in
London worth Pounds 575,000 were acceptable as sureties.
The magistrates said they would accept the two women's husbands as sureties
for Pounds 500,000 each. They were Mr Alnasir Virani, managing director of
the property side of Control Securities, and his brother Mr Zulfikar Virani,
managing director of Control's leisure company. Each said his annual income
was Pounds 225,000.
The court accepted a third surety of Pounds 250,000 from Mr Narinder Singh
Chadha, a Manchester businessman.
Other bail conditions require Mr Virani to report to Rochester Row police
station twice a week and to live at his home in Putney, south-west London.
Mr Scrivener, who applied successfully for reporting restrictions to be
lifted, said the magistrates' refusal to accept the two women as sureties
was 'an injustice and tantamount to refusal of bail'.
He said the SFO, which had opposed bail at the earlier hearing, had
withdrawn its opposition. Mr Scrivener said Mr Nazmu Virani was a man of
good character who had been Asian Businessman of the Year in 1990. 'He
pleads not guilty. It is not alleged he has taken any money.'

FT  08 APR 92 / O&amp;Y keen to meet Tube line payments
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OLYMPIA &amp; YORK, the property developer, is seeking a new timescale on
payments to secure an extension to the Jubilee underground line.
O&amp;Y is apparently committed to paying its full contribution to the project
and its legal representatives have been meeting London Transport in the hope
of reaching an agreement.
O&amp;Y was expected to pay the first instalment of Pounds 40m on March 31 but
was unable to do so. However, the Department of Transport has said that if
the agreement with O&amp;Y is not concluded before tomorrow's election, the
first payment will fall due on the day the agreement is signed.
Both O&amp;Y and London Transport are understood to have reluctantly concluded
that the future of the extension will have to await the outcome of the
election.
Much will depend on O&amp;Y's debt talks with banks, due on Monday.
London Transport would like O&amp;Y to stick as closely as possible to its
original timescale but it is thought that the developer favours a more
flexible approach.
London Transport said last night: 'We are anxious to start this project as
soon as possible but we cannot get the Secretary of State for Transport's
approval until we have sorted out the funding.'
Under proposals put to the department in 1989, O&amp;Y agreed to contribute
Pounds 400m towards the Pounds 1.3bn project.
A second instalment of O&amp;Y's contribution was scheduled for the end of March
1993, with the balance of Pounds 300m expected after completion of the
extension in 1996.
It is unclear whether a new timescale would delay the start of the project
or would put pressure on the incoming government to increase its
contribution at an earlier stage.
The developer believes Labour has given conflicting signals. Ms Joan Ruddock
has stated her support for the proposals but Mr John Prescott, the party's
transport spokesman, has warned that the project was 'going to be thrown
into the hands of the public sector'.

<TEXT>
PLANS TO announce details of the future structure of the ITV network had to
be abandoned yesterday because the ITV companies were not ready.
The Independent Television Commission was set to give details of the
structure, including how the national network will work and the relationship
between the ITV companies and independent producers.
The ITV companies said they needed more time to check on the details of the
proposed contracts to supply the central network scheduler with programmes,
licences and the guidelines on independent producers.
Individual companies decided on Monday they wanted to take legal advice on
the details of the contract and programme licences because of their
importance during the next 10 years of the franchises.
The ITV companies have now been given until April 24 to resolve remaining
difficulties. If the companies cannot reach agreement, the ITC has the power
to impose solutions.
Mr David Shaw, director of the ITV Association, said yesterday: 'We don't
have a problem but we do have legality after legality and these are very
complex documents.'
It was decided this week that Mr Shaw would be leaving the ITV Association
after 11 years because of the present restructuring and the move to a more
programme-oriented chief executive.

FT  08 APR 92 / SE will start service to aid small stocks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE STOCK Exchange is to introduce a special service to try to improve
dealing in 120 small stocks which are difficult to trade or illiquid in the
Official List and Unlisted Securities Market.
The exchange is starting a company bulletin-board service from April 27
which will run on Topic, its electronic information system. Information
about the companies will be provided, including details of the last 10
trades, the name of the company's corporate broker and current indicative
and firm market orders.
It will provide a more formal role for corporate brokers, who will be
responsible for providing information and easing trading in the stocks. In
the same way as an accredited dealer, corporate brokers will use best
endeavours to match and execute business. Members receiving buy or sell
instructions will first have to take account of any outstanding orders
displayed on the service if the same or a better price is available.
The changes follow criticism from investors and professionals about poor
liquidity in smaller stocks, and concern that information on potential
buyers and sellers is difficult to find.
Although liquidity of some tightly held shares will not be improved, the
exchange hopes the new service will make dealing in smaller companies more
efficient.

<TEXT>
RADIO CAROLINE, the former pirate station, went on the air legally yesterday
for the first time in 28 years.
The ship, now in Granville Docks, Dover, has been given a 28-day community
radio licence to broadcast to the local area.
The ship ran aground in gales last November and the six-man crew of the Ross
Revenge, the home of Radio Caroline, had to be rescued.
Quite apart from the damage caused by the storm, the future of pirate
stations such as Caroline is very much in doubt.
The 1990 Broadcasting Act opened up the possibility of a vast expansion of
commercial radio but at the same time increased the penalties on pirates.
Radio Caroline may now have little option but to go seriously legitimate.
As a pirate station, Radio Caroline, named after Caroline Kennedy, launched
the careers of disc jockeys such as Kenny Everett and Tony Blackburn and
influenced the style and content of the BBC's pop-music station, Radio 1.

FT  08 APR 92 / City faces glut of empty office space
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER, Property Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CITY of London might be left with 5m sq ft of virtually unlettable
offices by 1995, representing more space than the Canary Wharf complex and
16 times that of the NatWest Tower, according to a leading property
consultancy.
The report by Herring Baker Harris Research says vacancy rates in the City
are expected to remain at a record level of about 20 per cent until the end
of this year. It will then gradually decline to about 14 per cent at the end
of 1995, the report says.
The levels of empty property in the City, which have provoked a steep
decline in rents and capital values, result from a combination of the
recession and the surge of new developments at the end of the last decade.
During the 1980s, there was a 30 per cent increase in office stock and no
increase in net employment.
The report expects rental growth in some parts of the market, in spite of a
long-term vacancy rate of between 12 and 15 per cent. Demand for
high-quality offices will pick up by mid decade, leading to some growth in
rental values. Top rents will not reach the levels they attained in 1989-90
until the next decade.
About half the vacant space (6.15m sq ft) in the City is top-grade. Empty
space is fairly evenly distributed between the core and fringe of the City.
The report says that half the City's office stock will have been built
between 1986 and 1993. The upgrading of the City's office stock combined
with lower rents will be important in helping it to retain its dominant
position in Europe as a financial centre.
It judges that two significant threats to the City's tenant base have been
removed. In the West End, little space is available and the cost advantage
of Docklands has disappeared.
The report predicts that office demand will be generated not by expansion
but by restructuring. Companies will need new office space as a result of
mergers and the need to improve productivity. The report says: 'Demand is
more likely to be generated by recirculation than expansion in the 1990s,
with a flow from poor to good space.'
The balance of power between landlord and tenant will be more equitable in
future, the report predicts. Leases are likely to become more flexible,
lasting 15 years rather than 25 years as has been the case in recent
decades.
The tenant's position has been strengthened by high vacancy rates and the
volume of prospective developments that may be started in the mid 1990s to
respond to demand. In addition, occupiers are becoming more demanding, with
expectations increasingly influenced by terms available in overseas markets.
The survey highlights the steep drop in construction in the City. Less than
4m sq ft of City office development was under construction in December 1991,
compared with 10.3m sq ft six months earlier. In 1992, 0.4m sq ft of
developments will be started and 1.24m sq ft in 1993.

FT  08 APR 92 / Shattered nerves behind banks' bandit screens: How both
employers and employees suffer from armed robberies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BARCHARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEXT TIME you visit your bank or building society branch, spare a thought
for the people on the other side of the glass 'bandit screen' who live with
the possibility that an armed raider may burst in on them at any time.
Last year the number of armed robberies on building society and bank
branches in the UK rose to 1,633 - six for each working day  - with the
growth in raids being especially marked in London, where figures doubled.
This year's trend so far is still strongly upwards. There were 93 bank and
building society raids in the London area in the first three months,
compared with 63 in the same period a year ago.
The pattern of the attacks has also changed. The traditional target of
raiders has been a small or lonely building society branch, where about two
thirds of robberies have occurred. However, the figures for this year so far
in London suggest that bank robberies are becoming more frequent.
Nor is the familiar bank robbery the worst that can happen. Unpleasant
refinements such as hostage-taking and attacks on the homes of staff have
been reported.
Banks and building societies are reluctant to discuss raids and refuse to
say how much money is lost in robberies.
Scotland Yard's Flying Squad, the police unit that deals with bank raids,
confirmed that the amounts stolen are sometimes substantial and that many of
the raiders are not isolated amateur criminalsbut sophisticated
gangsterswhose moves are carefully planned.
Although banks and building societies install internal security devices,
such as cameras, alarms and protection screens that shoot up from the
counter to seal staff off from the attack, they seem reluctant to swap
information with each other about attacks.
Mr Noel Howell, a spokesman for Bifu, the bank employees union, said: 'A
branch may well not know that the branch of a rival just down the road has
been raided.'
One dismaying effect of the raids for banks and building societies is to
make it more difficult to operate open-plan branches in which bank staff
talk to customers in a relaxed environment across a desk - rather than
through the traditional bandit screen - which helps to generate sales
opportunities for insurance and other financial products.
Nevertheless, the Flying Squad said it believed improved security could cut
down successful raids.
Another worry for banks is the effect on staff, who may be left traumatised
by a raid. Nearly every attack on a branch is violent, involving the use of
guns and knives or toy replicas.
Large employers such as Halifax Building Society train their staff with
videos to anticipate all the thingsthat are likely to happen in a raid.
The Halifax said: 'Our videos recreate the sort of things they can expect in
a raid in fairly graphic terms. We don't want to frighten them but to
prepare them.'
Even so, the aftermath of an attack on a branch may be difficult for
employees to cope with. Two years ago Bifu was able to secure Pounds 1,500
from the Criminal Injuries Compensation Board for an employee who was left
permanently terrified by the sight of people in balaclava helmets.
Mr Howell said: 'We have got people who are frightened to go back to a
particular part of a building after a raid and a fifth of those affected
feel it eight weeks later.'
Bifu said some bank staff even quit their jobs so as not to face the risk of
a further raid. It said poor staff morale, significantly reduced staff
effectiveness, a rise in absenteeism and high staff turnover were the hidden
costs of bank raids.
The British Bankers Association described Bifu's attitude to bank raids as
slightly alarmist. The BBA makes a reward of up to Pounds 10,000 for
information leading to the arrest and conviction of bank robbers, but gave
no indication of how many such rewards are actually paid.
The association said: 'Out of a total of 21,000 bank and building society
branches in the UK, 1,600 raids is not a very high prop-ortion.'
However, some employers have taken steps to cope with the consequences of
raids. Abbey National, which said there has not been an increase in the
number of raids attempted on its branches in the last two years, has a team
of three full-time employee counsellors. Midland Bank employs a specialist
outside counselling service.
On one topic Bifu and the BBA are in full agreement. They both want the
government to outlaw the carrying of replica weapons used in the attacks.
'There is absolutely no reason for anyone to wander around in a bank with a
replica gun in their pocket,' the BBA said.

FT  08 APR 92 / Lloyd's confirms block on payments
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LLOYD'S OF London confirmed yesterday that it would act to block payments
from the Pounds 116m Outhwaite settlement to Names with outstanding
liabilities from their underwriting accounts.
Two legal advisers to Lloyd's suggested that the recoveries on behalf of
Names - the individuals whose assets underwrite the insurance business -
could be dealt with in accordance with its premium trust deed.
The deed will allow members' agents to retain any money from the settlement
to each Name up to the amount of any liabilities they have from membership
of underwriting syndicates.
The decision comes after talks started last Friday with representatives of
the 987 Names, who were members of the Outhwaite 316/661 syndicate in 1982,
and were due to benefit from the out-of-court settlement announced in
February.
Mr Peter Nutting, the businessman who negotiated the settlement, said he was
'absolutely furious' with the Lloyd's decision.
He said preparations had been made for payment of the money to Names this
week, and some were away on holiday without any knowledge that Lloyd's might
try to prevent payments being made.
The Names are seeking to avoid payment of claims this year and believe
evidence presented to the commercial court last week alleging irregularities
in the management of Gooda Walker syndicates has strengthened their case.
Mr David Coleridge, chairman of Lloyd's, said he considered the decision was
'entirely fair' to other Names who had met their own obligations and had to
contribute to central funds to meet others' liabilities.
It was unclear last night how many Names or how much of the settlement would
be affected by the decision.

FT  08 APR 92 / Vung Tao cargo in high demand: Saleroom
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A PAIR of blue and white beakers, with covers, part of a cargo of late
17th-century Chinese export porcelain that lay hidden on the sea bed for 300
years, sold for Fl 44,850 (Pounds 14,059), eight times its estimate, at
Christie's in Amsterdam yesterday.
The beakers were one lot among 28,000 pieces of porcelain rescued from the
sea off Vietnam and dubbed by Christie's the Vung Tao cargo.
As in the celebrated Nanking cargo of export porcelain, which Christie's
sold for Pounds 10.1m in 1986, there was great popular demand, with private
collectors bidding keenly against dealers. The total for the first day of
the sale was more than Pounds 2m, twice the estimate for the entire two-day
auction.
The beakers went to a Taiwanese dealer. A private buyer from Monaco paid Fl
32,200 (Pounds 10,094) for four blue and white tazze (cups) while a French
dealer paid an equivalent sum for another pair of blue and white beakers
with covers. Thirteen blue and white cylindrical vases with covers were
bought by a Scottish private collector for Fl 31,050 (Pounds 9,733). All
those prices were far above target.
The Asian trading vessel went down in the early 1690s and was discovered by
fishermen in 1989. The porcelain was destined for Amsterdam, not for use but
for display, to dress a room. Each item has been marked by Christie's and
much of the porcelain will appear soon in antique shops throughout Europe
and the Far East.
Prospective collectors should be warned that although the items are very
decorative, if the Nanking cargo provides a precedent, the blue and white
beakers, bowls and cups are unlikely to appreciate in price.
In London, Christie's sold a pastel by Sir Thomas Lawrence for a record
Pounds 82,500 to a private bidder on the telephone. It had carried a top
estimate of Pounds 30,000. It is a portrait of Mrs Ayscoghe Boucherett, her
two children, and her half-sister. It had been lost for almost a century,
since it sold at Christie's in 1896 for the impressive sum of 1,000 guineas.

FT  08 APR 92 / Election 1992: Bridging the credibility gap - Scotland's
changing political landscape after 13 years of minority rule
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE QUESTION to Mr Ian Lang, the Scottish secretary, was cruel. 'What
credibility,' a woman asked him in a live TV debate on Monday, 'does your
party still have in Scotland?'
Mr Lang, visibly exhausted, dispirited and tetchy after weeks of often
unrewarding campaigning around Scotland, sidestepped the question. But it
was highly relevant.
The Tories do not have much credibility left. After 13 years of minority
rule in Scotland with a dwindling number of seats, they face further
humiliation tomorrow, with Mr Lang forecast to lose his own seat of Galloway
&amp; Upper Nithsdale. The question is how many of their nine seats (out of 72
Scots constituencies) they will still hold if electors vote tactically to
get them out.
By contrast Mr Donald Dewar, the habitually anxious shadow Scottish
secretary, has been smiling as never before. He fully expects to fulfil his
lifetime's ambition and walk into the Scottish Office in Edinburgh by the
end of the week. He has already been briefed on what to expect from Sir
Russell Hillhouse, the permanent secretary there.
But the impish grin on the face of Mr Alex Salmond, leader of the Scottish
National party, suggests that he too has a lot to be satisfied about. Mr
Malcolm Bruce of the Liberal Democrats often looks smug too.
The Press Association opinion poll and the latest System 3 poll for The
Herald produced a virtually identical result for Scotland, putting Labour at
between 40 per cent and 41 per cent (down a little compared with some
previous findings), the SNP on 25 per cent (also down a couple of points),
the Tories virtually unchanged on 21 per cent and the Liberal Democrats up
from recent lows at between 12 per cent and 13 per cent.
That suggests two things: first, Labour stands to win about 50 seats, the
same number as in 1987. There are very few more it can reasonably expect to
win and its MPs in the central belt are usually protected by massive
majorities.
Second, in marginal or near-marginal seats around the edges of the Labour
heartland the SNP, Tories, Liberal Democrats and sometimes Labour are
scrapping in a four-party contest which under the first-past-the-post system
makes predicting the winner with certainty impossible.
The campaign in Scotland has often been as bleak as the wintry weather in
which it has been conducted. Although there has been the uniquely Scottish
issue of the country's constitutional future, the positions of the parties
had been chiselled in granite before the campaign began. The SNP has set the
pace, provoking the other parties into attacks on its two-headed manifesto
of seeking a mandate for independence and presenting the leftwing policies
it would implement if it won power after new Scottish elections.
Its support has doubled since 1987 and it poses the greatest threat to
Labour, many of whose supporters give it as their second choice. It is
easily the most popular party among young people - especially those who
parents vote Labour - because it is fresh and iconoclastic, while Labour
seems the party of the establishment.
Yet it does not seem to have convinced enough people. Support in the opinion
polls for independence is at its usual level of around 35 per cent (against
45 per cent for devolution) and not all supporters of independence will vote
SNP.
It is a myth that there are hardly any Conservatives left in Scotland. There
are plenty in traditional Tory areas such as parts of Edinburgh and some
rural areas. But in safe Labour-held seats, far fewer Tories than normal
have been prepared to go out canvassing. All are disheartened by the lack of
direction from Mr John Major and frustrated at Mr Lang's inability to score
sharp political points.
Their pitch is essentially negative. Scotland now has lower unemployment
than the rest of the UK for the first time and a much milder recession - but
few Scots believe it. The Tories' main theme, that the constitutional status
quo is best, has been upheld in heartfelt speeches by Mr Douglas Hurd, but
this has probably done no more than cement the party's existing unionist
support.
The Conservatives' arguments about the risks of devolution for Scotland's
standing in the UK are sound but technical: the majority of Scots do not see
why they should not have a Scottish parliament of some sort and resent being
told it would not be good for them. Mr Major's pleas on the subject this
week embarrassed many Scots Tories.
Labour has conducted an efficient, low-key campaign concentrating on its
best issues such as health, education and employment. It has emphasised that
all will be better with its devolved parliament, but not spelt out details
of how it will work, to avoid presenting a target for its opponents. The
Liberal Democrats have used visits by Mr Paddy Ashdown to target rural
constituencies where their sitting MPs often have a strong personal
following.
The SNP is likely, along with the Tories, to be a victim of the
first-past-the-post system. Although polls have put its support as high as
31 per cent, it is unlikely to add more than half a dozen seats to its
existing four. However, it has tended to win more votes than opinion polls
suggest.
The SNP should score in three Tory rural seats: Mr Lang's Galloway, Sir
Nicholas Fairbairn's Perth and Kinross, and Mr Bill Walker's Tayside North.
It may also take Argyll &amp; Bute from the Liberal Democrats, and could take
Dundee East and the Western Isles from Labour.
But, barring an enormous last minute swing, the great prize of serious
advances into Labour seats in the central belt will elude the SNP. Even
Govan, its only central-belt seat, is finely balanced. It has have good
hopes in Kilmarnock &amp; Loudon, but Labour's majority there is 14,000.
Labour should take Ayr, Mr George Younger's former seat. Whether it captures
Stirling, where Mr Michael Forsyth, the Thatcherite Scottish Office minister
has a majority of only 548, depends crucially on how the anti-Tory vote
splits.
If Stirling goes, the Tories would be down to four seats. That assumes Mr
Malcolm Rifkind, the transport secretary, keeps Edinburgh Pentlands and that
Lord James Douglas-Hamilton holds Edinburgh West against the Liberal
Democrats. Mr Allan Stewart is expected to hold Eastwood (a rich dormitory
area for Glasgow) and Sir Hector Monro, the Scottish Tory with the biggest
majority, Dumfries.
The late upturn for the Liberal Democrats in the opinion polls makes them
less likely to lose Sir Russell Johnston's Inverness Nair &amp; Lochaber seat to
Labour, and to hand back Menzies Campbell's seat in Fife North-East to the
Conservatives.
Equally, Tory chances of avenging November's by-election humiliation at the
hands of the Liberal Democrats in Kincardine and Deeside may be more remote.
Friday therefore looks like yet another black day for the Scottish
Conservatives and a day of frustration for the SNP. The Liberal Democrats
could come out relatively unscathed.
Labour may be lucky to make a net gain of more than a seat or two. Yet it
should have come into its inheritance.

FT  08 APR 92 / Election 1992: Heseltine hits at opposition's Scottish plans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR MICHAEL HESELTINE, the environment secretary, last night launched a
ferocious attack on opposition policies of devolution and independence for
Scotland and delivered a vivid warning about the dangers of nationalism.
Addressing a delighted audience at a Conservative party rally in Edinburgh,
he said: 'The future of Scotland and the Union which bind the United Kingdom
together is under threat as never before. All our opponents want to change
Britain.
'They want a different Britain. A Britain on the sidelines. A Scotland
diminished. A Britain broken.'
The Scottish Nationalist party offered Scotland the straight choice of
separatism and socialism. It was a 'cynical creed which spells destruction,
division and disunity'.
Labour and Liberal Democrat support for devolution was a cynical move to
save their votes from the SNP, he said. Devolution would produce another
layer of bureaucracy with higher taxes and a worse climate for investment.
Independence would destroy Scotland's ability to influence the big decisions
in Nato, in Europe and in international economic forums.
Nationalism was on the march and was producing 'extremism in France, riots
on the streets of Marseilles, fascism on the rise in Germany' and ethnic
hatred, racial bitterness and social turmoil in eastern Europe. German
nationalism had nearly destroyed the UK. 'Scotland couldn't have stopped
Hitler alone,' said Mr Heseltine. 'But nor could England or Wales or
Ireland. None of us. Together we did. This union of ours did.'
Labour's devolution was to assemblies, councils, unions, committees, working
parties and pressure groups. The real devolution was to the 'real Scottish
people' through the purchase of their council houses, the choice of school
to which to send their children and control of schools through school
boards, all of them Tory innovations.

FT  08 APR 92 / Election 1992: Minority parties define their terms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE MINORITY parties yesterday joined in the pre-hung parliament
manoeuvring, with both the Ulster Unionists and Plaid Cymru, the Welsh
nationalist party, outlining the price for their support in such
circumstances.
In moves likely to add fuel to Conservative arguments that a government of
any other complexion could foreshadow the end of the union, both placed
devolution for their respective regions high on their shopping lists. But
the Ulster Unionists hinted at emollience with a pledge not to bring down a
minority government 'recklessly'.
Mr James Molyneaux, UUP leader, said: 'We would not recklessly say that,
unless we get our way on all things, we will bring the government down.' He
predicted that another election within a month or six weeks would cause
turmoil in the City.
Mr Molyneaux said Unionists would vote against a Labour government if it
pressed ahead with proposals for Scottish devolution without making the same
provision for Ulster.
He warned that there could be no surrender of sovereignty over the
Maastricht treaty or greater European union, or any attempt to extend the
Anglo-Irish agreement.
'We are not demanding anything - the two (main) parties are very well aware
of our position,' said Mr Molyneaux. 'If they don't want to aggravate us and
entice us into the opposition lobby, they will know to avoid those issues.'
Mr Dafydd Wigley, Plaid president, said his party would seek a guarantee
that Wales would be treated as favourably as Scotland on devolution.
A comprehensive language act and a low-interest-loan fund for small
businesses and farmers were among the commitments it would seek in the
Queen's Speech. Also on its list were measures to help first-time homebuyers
and water-bill rebates for pensioners and low-income families.
The Ulster Unionist parties expect to retain all 13 of their seats in the
election. Plaid Cymru had three MPs in the last parliament, who are all
expected to hold their seats.

FT  08 APR 92 / Election 1992: Distance helps to put rhetoric in perspective
 -View from: Wall Street
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE possibility of an outright Labour victory may have rattled the London
stock market last week, but Wall Street seems to be taking a more sanguine,
though not completely untroubled, view.
Some US fund managers argue that if British share prices fall much further,
the market may even present interesting buying opportunities.
'We are reaching the kind of risk/reward levels where it might reward one to
be slightly more in than slightly more out,' says Mr John Hickling, who runs
a fund specialising in Europe at Fidelity, a US investment management group.
Why such sang-froid? It is partly because any US fund manager with a degree
of foresight is likely to have lightened his UK position many months ago in
anticipation of political uncertainty. Mr Hickling, for example, has been
'underweight' in the UK for the past six months - in other words, he has
reduced his British holdings relative to those in continental countries.
But it also stems from the perspective on British affairs granted by a
distance of 3,000 miles: US fund managers tend to view Europe as a single
entity, and having lived for years with socialist government in France, the
possibility of one in Britain does not hold too many horrors.
Indeed, the bulk of analysts' reports sent home from the London offices of
Wall Street houses over recent weeks have stressed how much Tory and Labour
economic policies have in common, notably in the areas of exchange rates and
the fiscal deficit.
'Despite the rhetoric, there is little difference between the macro-economic
policies of the two main parties,' said a Merrill Lynch circular. 'Evidence
of the past 25 years suggests there is little to choose between Labour and
Conservatives either in terms of their economic record or of their impact on
the equity market.'
Similarly, Salomon Brothers maintained that: 'A change of government, either
to a Labour majority or to a minority administration, would not
significantly change near-term economic growth prospects, because neither
the Conservatives nor the Labour party is offering a break from the tight
monetary and moderately loose fiscal policies of the past year.'
That is not to say that US fund managers would not prefer a Tory victory. In
the short-term, many expect a further sharp drop in share prices, possibly
accompanied by a sterling crisis, if Labour wins or there is a hung
parliament.
Many are also suspicious about how much Labour really has modified its
socialist agenda, and - a crucial issue for foreign investors  - the party's
commitment to maintaining sterling at its present level within the European
monetary system.
'At this point I think we can only assume Mr Kinnock will stick to his
word,' says Fidelity's Mr Hickling. 'But I could envision him getting in and
saying 'now we've looked at the books and it's different'.'
However, relatively few on Wall Street have a keen interest in the outcome
of the election, because few of them have a sizeable direct financial stake
in the country.
For most Americans, investing abroad remains slightly exotic, and they are
far more concerned about prospects for US recovery and the Democratic party
primary election in New York state. Elsewhere, their anxieties are focused
on the slide of the Tokyo stock market and its possible repercussions at
home.
At the same time, some Wall Streeters wonder whether the British election
might be providing straws in the wind to some broader political and
financial forces.
Mr Donald Coxe, chief economist at institutional trader Gordon Capital, says
his clients have been wondering whether Labour's new strength is indicative
of a general swing to the left which could be reflected in this year's US
presidential election.
He also notes that there has been an 'almost mystic convergence' between the
Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index of leading US stocks and the FT-SE 100 index
over the past two years. However, London's sharp drop during the past few
weeks has broken this parallel movement.
Does this represent a parting of the ways, possibly temporary, or just might
the British election be sending advance warning of bearish times ahead on
Wall Street?

FT  08 APR 92 / Election 1992: Going may prove too heavy for Patten - How
the odds stack up for the better-known runners
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL THOMPSON-NOEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TORY party chairman Chris Patten drifting in the betting like a drug-nobbled
Derby runner.
Movie queen Glenda Jackson turning in the performance of a lifetime.
And Olympic gold medallist Sebastian Coe staggering badly in the finishing
straight.
These are three of the snapshots provided by bookmaker William Hill's list
of celebrity election odds, covering 100 constituencies in which the tumult
of tomorrow's UK election battle is proving most raucous.
In Bath, puffy-eyed Chris Patten started the campaign a solid favourite at
1-3 (stake three to win one plus your stake back). But in concert with the
Tories' waning electoral fortunes, the Conservative chairman's odds have
skidded embarrassingly to 6-5.
In contrast, actress Glenda Jackson, Labour's virgin-queen candidate in
Hampstead and Highgate, has been promoted from 1-3 to a regal - and
unbackable - 1-9.
This did not stop one of Hill's client in Southend supporting the Oscar
winner with a bet of Pounds 10,000 - plus Pounds 1,000 in betting tax - to
win a paltry Pounds 325, described by Hill as one of the most baffling
election bets ever struck. Because of the dire effect of betting tax, the
true odds on this bet are a fraction under 1-34.
In Falmouth and Camborne, the Tories' Sebastian Coe started the race at 1-4,
but has wobbled so alarmingly that he is now rated only a 6-4 chance.
In general, Hill's 100 celebrity seats contain a preponderance of
high-betting marginals in which Tory candidates - especially incumbents -
are under fire. Although bookmakers' odds are by no means infallible, they
dramatise the struggle for survival facing a number of Tory stars.
Transport secretary Malcolm Rifkind could be hurtling off the rails. Tiny
Colin Moynihan, the former sports minister, may be taking a very early bath.
Sir Nicholas Fairbairn is deep in trouble. John Taylor, the Tories' black
candidate in Cheltenham, the snooty spa town, has drifted from 6-4 to 9-4.
The odds against Anthony Beaumont-Dark have almost tripled, to 3-1. And even
in blue-rinsed Kensington, Dudley Fishburn's odds have eased, though last
night he was still the 5-6 favourite.
All told, bookmakers expect an election turnover of Pounds 6m nationally,
with a flurry of heavy bets today and tomorrow. In recent days the odds have
stabilised, and now point firmly to a hung parliament.
Hill's latest odds show Labour favourite to win most seats, at 1-4, with the
Tories 5-2 and the Liberal Democrats 200-1. It is quoting 4-6 on a hung
parliament, and 11-8 against Labour winning an overall majority.
In Putney Keith Hagenbach, candidate for the Green party, has invested
Pounds 250 on himself at 100-l to poll 6.2 per cent of the vote, which would
be a record for the Greens.
There has even been a flicker of interest in the Natural Law Party.
William Hills' Graham Sharpe said last night: 'We have taken nearly Pounds
20 on Natural Law to win most seats at 50,000-1. We have no plans to trim
their odds.'

FT  08 APR 92 / Election 1992: Schools and jobs will make the difference
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DRUIDS HEATH in Birming-ham Hall Green is an election-poster desert. The
campaign has had little impact on this 1960s estate of about 2,700 council
houses and flats, where unemployment is about 30 per cent.
The implications of the tax proposals of Mr Norman Lamont and Mr John Smith
mean little in this part of Birmingham, where fear of unemployment and the
recession have dominated local concerns.
'People here have to think carefully about the financial consequences when
they catch a bus into town,' said Mr Ken Atkinson, treasurer of the
neighbourhood development association. 'The problem for Labour here is
whether people in this part of the constituency will bother to vote at all.
Many are beyond hoping that any system is going to benefit them.'
Turning out for the vote is crucial if Ms Jane Slowey, the Labour candidate,
is to achieve the swing of nearly 9 per cent needed to unseat Mr Andrew
Hargreaves, the Tory defender.
The neat, owner-occupied semi-detached houses that comprise the majority of
housing in Hall Green have returned a Conservative since the seat was formed
in 1950, but it has never been safe.
The constituency exemplifies the working-class Tory vote that has been a
tradition of skilled labour in Birmingham since the 19th century. Running
through the workforce is a strong thread that upholds ideals of
self-betterment and improvement through education. Perhaps because of that,
the Conservatives have been able to capitalise on parental fears about
Labour's education policy.
Baverstock School, next to Druids Heath, has made a success of opting for
grant-maintained status and neither the headmaster nor the parents want it
to return to the former system.
Ms Slowey has taken issue with the headmaster over his stance - but she was
the one who faced heated questions from Baverstock parents at a meeting last
week, and she may have seen some Labour votes desert her because of the row.
In a seat which, because of national swings, is likely to be a close result,
the loss of any votes by Labour might mean the difference between winning
and losing.
An enthusiastic campaign run by the Liberal Democrat candidate, Mr David
McGrath, may be a factor in the result. He claims that his party is taking
votes from the Conservatives and holding on to votes it collected in the
local elections last year, which made it the dominant party in one ward.
All the candidates agree that the issues have not changed here during the
campaign. Tax was never very important. Fear of unemployment is a real
concern, so is education, but come tomorrow the parties believe voting will
largely reflect national intentions.

FT  08 APR 92 / Election 1992: Churchill still digging for victory
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROGER MATTHEWS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   THE OWNER of the best introductory one-liner in British politics
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
'Hello, I'm Winston Churchill' - is in danger of losing his seat.
The grandson of Britain's wartime leader was still confident and wowing the
respectful middle-aged in Sale shopping centre, Manchester, on Monday
afternoon. But his relative lack of success among the young, some of whom
responded with a pointed reversal of the Churchillian sign of victory, may
indicate a wider malaise.
After 22 years, the Churchill grip on the Davyhulme constituency in Greater
Manchester should be firm. Three weeks ago it looked as if it would be
weakened, but not broken. Mr Churchill still says he detects no sign of the
surge required to overturn his 8,199 majority.
This week, though, Mr Barry Brotherton for Labour and Dr Jackie Pearcey for
the Liberal Democrats have begun to sound as if they believe Mr Churchill
could be toppled.
The evidence is far from overwhelming. None of the parties will have carried
out anything like a complete canvass by polling day. Because Davyhulme has
not been considered marginal, the organisations of the three parties are
less impressive than in other more tightly contested seats.
Mr Brotherton, a quietly-spoken engineer who has had to come to terms with
pinstripe suits and buttonholes sprouting flowers, argues that if Labour is
building on the last local council elections, a swing of much less than 8
per cent will give him the seat.
Dr Pearcey, a nuclear physicist trying to build on a 23 per cent share of
the vote, talked three weeks ago of pushing Labour into third place.
Ambition has bloomed and she now sees the possibility of relegating Mr
Churchill to last place.
What seems to be happening is no more than a reflection of the past three
weeks elsewhere in the north-west. Mr Churchill's hard core of support will
not be eroded. The name and the Tory tradition in an area scarcely noted for
radicalism are bound to keep him closely in contention.
Yet the Conservative vote is being nibbled away at the edges by abstentions,
a few direct transfers to Labour, and by rather more who say they will vote
Liberal Democrat. How far and how fast the process is moving are questions
that have added much needed spice to the final days of a rather dour
campaign.
All the candidates accept that a significant, perhaps substantial, number of
voters will not make up their mind until the last minute.
Long-serving party workers say they cannot recall an election more difficult
to predict or one where it has been as tough to assess what tactical-voting
trends might emerge. And that, of course, will be the let-out for everyone
who gets the result wrong.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PREVAILING trend of the campaign was again visible yesterday as shares
that might benefit from a Labour win outperformed those that might gain from
a Conservative victory.
Since the campaign started, 'Tory gainers' have dropped more than 12 per
cent - twice the fall in the FT-SE index of big-company shares. 'Labour
gainers' have fallen less than 4 per cent.
The index sections reflect views of which companies stand to gain and lose
most from the result.

FT  08 APR 92 / Election 1992: Message unclear amid the graffiti
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FROM ITS ill-lit walkways to its screeds of obscure graffiti, the Haverfield
estate in London's Brentford is an archetypical concrete jungle.
It houses more than 1,000 traditional - but often disillusioned  - Labour
voters. The party's prospects of overturning the 7,953 Tory majority in
Brentford and Isleworth may hang on whether these people can be bothered to
vote.
Labour needs a 7.8 per cent swing to take the largely middle-class
constituency, held for the Tories by Sir Barney Hayhoe since 1974. Recent
polls showing a movement towards Labour of between 7 per cent and 8 per cent
in the capital suggest a close race.
Against Labour's candidate, Ms Ann Keen, is the fact that much of the
disillusionment on the estates is directed against the Labour-run council.
The relatively well-heeled may be put off by the party's tax proposals. But,
as elsewhere, tax and economic affairs in general have apparently failed to
grab the voters' imagination. As Mr Nirj Deva, the Conservative candidate
admits: 'The average voter is not particularly interested in economic
matters.'
This - and the spotlight on health as the contest's most important issue -
may help Labour. All the more so as Mr Deva feels he has been hampered by
'the silly campaign they have been running' on the subject from Central
Office. The party's failure to get its message across has left voters
'oblivious' to improvements in the NHS, he says.
Sir Barney's retirement may also be beneficial to Labour. Mr Deva admits he
has found the large number of public meetings 'hard going', but felt it was
important to be present to ensure he was well-known to constituents.
Labour has used canvass returns to target categories of voters with
computer-printed letters. This has not been free from hitches: some floating
voters have been irritated to be addressed as if they were Tory supporters.
Confronted by well-financed rivals, Liberal Democrat Ms Janet Salmon and her
dozen or so doughty helpers have concentrated on describing their party's
policies to constituents face-to-face. 'We would certainly hope to do
respectably,' she says.

FT  08 APR 92 / Election 1992: Polls suggest Labour is increasing lead in
marginals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARETH SMYTH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FIRST full week of the election campaign was dominated by the tax issue.
Conservative strategists believed the March 10 Budget would reinforce their
image as the 'low tax' party.
Meanwhile Labour claimed that eight out of 10 families would benefit from
the shadow Budget of Mr John Smith.
During that week, Financial Times reporters visited Davyhulme in Manchester,
Birmingham Hall Green and Brentford &amp; Isleworth in London - three socially
typical Tory-held marginal seats in the regions where the election will be
determined.
This week, they have returned to those constituencies to gauge the impact of
the campaign upon the electorate.
The three regions - north-west England, the Midlands and London  - contain
65 of the 94 Conservative-held seats that the Labour party probably needs to
win to gain an overall majority at Westminster.
The regional breakdown of the opinion poll carried out last week for the
Press Association by ICM with 10,000 voters - the largest sample used during
the campaign - suggests that Labour will capture Birmingham Hall Green and
is close to winning Brent-ford &amp; Isleworth and Davyhulme.
A Gallup 9,000 poll, carried out between February 19 and March 17 as the
campaign opened, gave the Labour party a 1 per cent national lead. The ICM
poll for the Press Association finds Labour's lead up to 2.5 percentage
points.
Labour seems to be picking up the extra support in the right places. The two
polls found a broadly similar swing to Labour (6 per cent and 7 per cent) in
London, but the ICM/Press Association poll suggests an increasing swing to
Labour in both the Midlands and the north-west as the campaign has
progressed.
Polls have shown tax far behind the National Health Service, education and
the economy in terms of issues which are important to voters. However,
Conservative managers insist that - regardless of what the pollsters are
told - electors will vote with their wallets once in the privacy of the
booth.
The psephologists call this 'pocket-book voting'.
As the campaign draws to a close, Mr John Major, the prime minister, has
returned to the theme of tax and insisted that only a Conservative
government will end the recession. The polls still show a Conservative lead
on 'ability to manage the economy' and as the party under which people feel
they will be best off financially.
How do voters respond in the crucial seats?

FT  08 APR 92 / Election 1992: Kinnock says NHS in mortal danger
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR NEIL KINNOCK, Labour leader, last night painted the Conservatives as
'tired and washed up' without any ambition for the future of Britain.
Speaking at a rally in Blackburn, Lancashire, on the penultimate day of
campaigning, Mr Kinnock called on the electorate to vote to reject a
government which he said had no plan to rescue Britain from recession and
which was placing the NHS in 'mortal danger'.
The Labour leader said that, after 13 years in power, the government had
proved beyond doubt that it had 'no ambition to make Britain better and no
conscience about making Britain worse'.
With Labour anxious to ensure that supporters turn out in force tomorrow in
what promises to be a close contest, Mr Kinnock urged voters to use their
hard-earned right to choose between two parties offering starkly different
options for the future.
Voters, he said, could choose between the Tory approach of letting the
future take care of itself, with continuing recession and further
privatisation, or Labour's proposals for economic recovery and
modernisation.
He said that the government, in asking to be re-elected for the third time,
was expecting the voters to forget two recessions, millions of unemployed
people, thousands of bankruptcies and mounting home repossessions. He added:
'They are asking the people to treat what they have done as a success. After
all they have done, they simply do not deserve to be elected.
'These architects of recession, these engineers of run-down, cannot be
called upon to build the future.'
Mr Kinnock said ministers were 'tired, washed up, like door-to-door
salesmen, blue with cold, desperate to find a customer, unable to think of a
new angle'.
He accused the government of throwing away Pounds 100bn of oil revenues that
could have rebuilt the country's schools, the National Health Service, and
the transport system. Instead it had been given away in tax cuts.
Keeping the NHS at the forefront of the closing stages of the campaign, Mr
Kinnock said it represented 'part of the bedrock of Britain' and was the
most practical expression of a civilised society. But he said the health
service was in danger of being broken up under the Tories and voters had to
choose at the polls to prevent it from being 'split from top to bottom'.
He added: 'They are breaking it apart and in another five years they will
all but have finished the job.' Labour, he claimed, had policies for pulling
Britain out of recession and building a recovery that would last.

FT  08 APR 92 / Election 1992: Poll predicts Forsyth defeat
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
AN OPINION poll last night suggested that Mr Michael Forsyth, the
controversial Scottish Office minister, is likely to lose his seat in
Stirling, where he had a majority of 548 in 1987.
According to a System 3 survey for The Herald newspaper and Scottish
Television, Labour candidate Ms Kate Phillips is on 40 per cent (against 36
per cent in 1987), Conservatives 33 (38), Scottish National party 20 (11)
and Liberal Democrats 7 (15).
Pollsters interviewed 1,058 people on April 4, of whom a high 23 per cent
were undecided or would not say how they would vote.

FT  08 APR 92 / Election 1992: Christian Democrats accept Tory MEPs
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN'S 32 Conservative Euro MPs were last night accepted into the
European parliament's Christian Democrat group - which favours proportional
representation.
Their application to join was accepted by the Christian Democrats with a
sizeable majority - 66 in favour and 28 against, with five abstentions.
Dutch Christian Democrat Mr Tom Penders, who opposed having the Tories as
allied members, said afterwards: 'That's it. They are de facto inside the
group, and have accepted all the principles we stand for.'
The move came amid reports that Mr John Major had signalled his willingness
to consider accepting PR for elections to the European parliament in 1994.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR NEIL KINNOCK left an upbeat news conference on the National Health
Service yesterday to find himself firmly contradicted on Labour's plans to
halt GP fundholding and hospital trusts by NHS employees, Ivo Dawnay writes.
Two callers on the BBC's Election Call phone-in programme articulately
rejected his prescriptions and insisted that Tory reforms were improving
patient care.
Mr Kinnock, after a campaign in which he has rarely been wrong-footed by the
press, was later discomfited by a woman trade unionist from Bridgwater in
Somerset.
Ms Yvonne Anthony questioned Mr Kinnock on the impact of Labour's proposals
for a minimum wage. She claimed the measure would lead to leapfrogging pay
claims and the loss of jobs.
Mr Kinnock countered by saying that fears of job losses as a consequence of
equal-pay legislation had not come to fruition. 'No, Mr Kinnock,' she
replied, 'I actually worked for a company at that time that made 25 per cent
of its female workforce redundant.'
Earlier, the Labour leader had returned the NHS to the centre of the party's
election campaign at its penultimate news conference - suitably attended by
a group of hospital nurses. Arguing that the future of the service lay at
the 'heart' of the election, he said Labour was appealing to the electorate
to give it a democratic mandate to save and develop the NHS.

FT  08 APR 92 / Election 1992: Major supports Baker and fuels immigration
row
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN MAJOR yesterday strongly backed Mr Kenneth Baker's efforts to put
immigration on the electoral agenda in spite of charges that the
Conservatives' were 'scaremongering' and playing the race card.
The prime minister said the home secretary had been 'right to make the
warning' in a speech on Monday, although he added that he regretted that
immigration sometimes became a party political matter.
Mr Neil Kinnock said Mr Baker's remarks were 'not really worthy of him.'
Accusing the home secretary of scaremongering, he said: 'To try and drag in
the activities of extreme right parties is so irrelevant to British
politics. The British people show no inclination whatsoever in any system of
election to support the far right.'
Mr Major insisted that it was thanks to 'firm but fair' immigration policies
that Britain's race relations had improved and that the country had not
suffered from the same problems that recently provoked riots in Marseilles.
Distancing Conservative policy from the 'colourful language' employed by Sir
Nicholas Fairbairn, the Tory candidate for Perth and Kinross, on race
questions at the weekend, Mr Major said the home secretary was entitled to
comment on immigration.
'What Kenneth Baker warned of yesterday was the danger that could be caused
if that firm but fair immigration control was swept aside,' he said.
The controversy over Mr Baker's comments came after he had suggested that
Labour and the Liberal Democrats were preparing a 'deadly political
cocktail' for Britain by weakening immigration controls and simultaneously
proposing electoral reform that would 'unleash extremists'.
Mr Paddy Ashdown, Liberal Democrat leader, immediately condemned his remarks
as 'panicky scaremongering.'
Questioned over growing representation for the French National Front and the
German extreme right as a consequence of proportional representation, Mr
Ashdown said that by contrast it was Britain's first-past-the-post system
that encouraged extremist rule.
He pointed out that if Italy had used the UK system, the Communist party
would have held power in the 1960s with between 38 and 40 per cent of the
vote.

FT  08 APR 92 / Election 1992: PM appeals on ticket of '10 Tory truths'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN Major last night stressed traditional Conservative values such as
strong defence and trade union reform - what he called '10 Tory truths' - as
he invoked the government's achievements since 1979 with his own record and
his aims for Britain.
At his last rally of the campaign, he made a personal appeal to voters,
telling his 1,000-strong audience at Wembley Conference Centre in London: 'I
have only just begun the tasks I have set myself.
'I ask this nation to look at my record of service and my ideals for the
future, to place their trust in me, and in this party, that has served them
so well and faithfully.'
His own experiences, he said, meant that he understood 'what makes the heart
of Britain beat'.
In spite of the opinion polls continuing to show a slight Labour lead and a
day's campaigning that was at best low-key, the mood on the Major tour is
relentlessly cheerful.
This final rally broadly followed the format of others in the campaign but
was given some razzmatazz by the presence of Ms Cilla Black, video tributes
from Mr Douglas Hurd and Mr Michael Heseltine - Mr Major's opponents in the
contest for the party leadership following Mrs Thatcher's resignation - and
the distribution to the audience of flags, hats and party poppers.
In an upbeat, effective performance, the prime minister set out his vision
of a Europe of nation states, and of economic recovery in Britain together
with both cuts in taxation and higher spending on public services.
While most of his '10 truths' promised more of the same for a fourth term.
It was notable that the message on privatisation merely referred backwards
to the changes that had already been made.
Mr Major's speech also contained stark warnings about the effects of a
Labour victory. He said that there would be a steep and immediate drop in
the value of homes, shares and pensions if Labour won, and underlined the
prospect of greater powers for trade union leaders.
Labour would mean, he said, perhaps the biggest transfer of wealth away from
personal ownership that the UK had seen. 'It would be a massacre of the
innocents by the ignorant.'
Mr Neil Kinnock came under a fierce attack, as the prime minister accused
him of the 'anything-for-office' syndrome, in which no belief was
indispensable.
'To what principles, to what beliefs would the Labour leader resort when the
going is tough? Labour would be a rudderless ship in a storm-tossed sea,' he
said.
He also condemned Mr Kinnock's offer to open discussions on proportional
representation. PR was 'nothing to do with fair play; everything to do with
power play', he said.

FT  08 APR 92 / Election 1992: Smith's Budget fails to impress industry
chiefs - FT/Mori Poll of Top Company Executives
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR John Smith's shadow Budget has not impressed business leaders, according
to the second Mori survey of board-level executives for the FT.
Only 7 per cent of the 165 executives, taken from a sample of 235 first
interviewed at the start of the election campaign, said that Labour's
package would be best for business. That compared with the 89 per cent who
preferred the package of tax changes announced by Mr Norman Lamont.
The executives acknowledge that Labour's proposed 50p top tax rate and
abolition of the ceiling on National Insurance contributions has made
personal taxation a much more important factor.
An overwhelming 72 per cent say that management of the economy is the most
important factor (against 71 per cent in March). But the proportion citing
personal taxation as a key issue has jumped from 27 per cent to 45 per cent.
Twenty-two per cent said that Labour's higher tax rates would mean they were
likely to work less hard. But more than double that number - 48 per cent -
said they thought that Mr Smith's tax package would reduce work incentives
for their middle management.
In spite of criticism of his performance during the campaign, Mr Lamont's
personal rating among business executives has risen slightly. Some 41 per
cent say he would make a better chancellor than Mr Smith, up from 39 per
cent in March. Mr Smith's rating has fallen from 46 to 44 per cent.
Most discouraging for Labour are the findings that 96 per cent think
interest rates would have to rise if Mr Kinnock wins the election; 83 per
cent expect downward pressure on the pound; and more than a third (38 per
cent) predict a fall in their companies' investment spending in Britain.
That represents a hardening of anxieties about a Labour victory during the
campaign. In the first interviews, 76 per cent said that interest rates
would have to rise, 75 per cent said sterling would weaken and only 26 per
cent said their investment would fall.
But the executives are distinctly unimpressed by the Tories' handling of
their campaign. Only 1 per cent thought the governing party had run the best
campaign.
Mori/On-line Telephone Surveys interviewed by telephone 165 directors of
companies from the FT UK Top 500 on April 6 and 7. All respondents, with 70
others, had been interviewed on March 11 and 12.

FT  08 APR 92 / Election 1992: Close battle in the land of zero poll tax -
Labour has the edge in Tooting but may struggle to take Battersea
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IF LABOUR fails to secure the London seats it needs on April 9, it will be
because it has not got its message through to people like Peter Davies.
A plasterer and first-time voter, he lives in a tatty housing estate on the
north side of Lavender Hill, in Battersea, south-west London.
With the recession biting, he earns well under Pounds 20,000 a year, but
will be voting Tory.
'Labour are only going to put up taxes,' he explains in a remark which is
likely to exasperate John Smith and his shadow Treasury team.
Battersea, with the second smallest Tory majority in the capital - 857  -
was won by John Bowis in 1987, after 52 years in Labour hands. Neighbouring
Tooting has been held for Labour by Tom Cox since 1970, but with an
increasingly precarious majority.
The two seats may confound any national or capital-wide swing to Labour on
polling day.
Both are in Wandsworth, the Conservatives' model borough, renowned for its
low poll tax and which voted decisively in favour of the Tories and against
the prevailing trend in the council elections of 1990.
Both have been affected by gentrification, with thousands of professionals
moving in at the expense of comparatively low-paid manual workers.
It has been widely assumed that these factors would turn Labour's task of
winning Battersea and holding Tooting into an uphill battle.
The comments of people like Peter Davies suggest a third element - the
continuing alienation of residents in traditional Labour-voting areas.
Several of his neighbours have expressed the same voting intentions.
Their reasons range from gratitude for implementing the council house
right-to-buy scheme to opposition to Labour's perceived bias in favour of
gays and ethnic minorities.
Alf Dubs, Labour's self-effacing and experienced candidate, concedes that
many traditional Labour supporters believe there is nothing the three main
parties can do to help them. The level of 'undecideds' is still quite high.
Dubs, Battersea's MP for eight years before he was unseated, is more upbeat
about the impact on his prospects of Wandsworth council's antics.
Like Tom Cox in Tooting, he claims there is a mounting feeling that a low
poll tax is 'too high a price to pay' for cuts in services. Both Labour
candidates expect to be helped by publicity surrounding the borough's
hurriedly withdrawn plans to cut more than Pounds 3m from local school
budgets. Both argue that gentrification has slowed and will therefore load
the dice against them less than it did in 1987.
Cox believes that the Tories cannot count on the yuppie vote. Rising
unemployment and the moribund property market have left them 'very, very
bitter', he says, acknowledging that he would be more worried about the
potential impact 'if the economy was bubbling.'
Well-drilled and resourceful though his team is, Dubs faces a further
obstacle - the impressive and individualistic campaign being waged by John
Bowis.
There can be few Tory candidates who make such abundant use of the colour
pink in campaign materials. He has also rejected Central Office's Henry
Purcell campaign theme in favour of a ditty by Andrew Lloyd Webber. 'We won
with it last time,' he explains.
With his dumpy frame and wide-set eyes, Bowis has the priceless knack of
exuding integrity on the doorstep. In contrast to the torpor and
disorganisation which have dogged the Conservatives' national campaign, his
team bristles with vigour and military discipline.
Asked about polls indicating a substantial swing in the capital to Labour,
Bowis chuckles and brands them 'absurd'.
In Tooting, it is the Tories who are likely to emerge disappointed as a
revitalised Cox campaign - supplemented by a squadron of helpers from
Surbiton - appears to have got its act together, making the constituency
office hum.
The former junior Treasury minister, who entered parliament at the same time
as Neil Kinnock, has not been among Westminster's most prominent characters.
But leafletting on Tooting Broadway, he is in his element: a Captain
Mainwaring figure in blue anorak and sensible shoes, exchanging pleasantries
and barking advice to constituents, with many of whom he clearly enjoys a
close and cordial relationship.
Martin Winter, his main opponent, has spent most of the campaign hobbling
around on NHS crutches. His broken ankle may symbolise his prospects.
He may find his best chance of winning the seat came and went with the
buoyant economy of 1987. In a morning rendezvous with a dozen pensioners, he
is cheerful and articulate, but describes his early experience of the City
as if addressing a bunch of merchant banking trainees.
'He is a very charming young man but he is too soft,' concludes Ethel
Hammond, who is 80-ish going on 35. That is a judgment few would level at
his canny opponent.

FT  08 APR 92 / Election 1992: Dover may be set to feel sea change
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TORY-held Dover, Britain's gateway to the rest of Europe, will open Labour's
door to government tomorrow if Mr Colin Bartholomew has his way.
Mr Bartholomew and Mr Joe Nicholas, two veteran seamen cooks laid off by
Sealink last year, have started up a coffee shop in Dover's city centre.
'It's time for a change. It's certainly changed us,' said Mr Bartholomew
declaring his intention to vote Labour.
Mr Gwyn Prosser, the Labour candidate - himself an ex-Sealink officer
engineer who took voluntary redundancy last autumn - was at the shop's
opening this week. If he upsets the Conservative incumbent, Mr David Shaw,
defending a 6,541 majority, Mr Prosser may pop by again for a slice of
celebratory cheesecake.
The cooks' transition from ship to shore symbolises the transformation
confronting Dover as it grapples with the prospect of large job losses in
port-related activities in the next few years. The opening of the Channel
tunnel in nearby Folkestone in 1993-94 threatens to choke off Dover's
livelihood.
Dover Council officials estimate that 5,000 further jobs will go by 1995,
with staff reductions on the ferries, the ending of tunnel construction
work, and job losses among freight forwarders as the liberalised single
European market comes into force.
Mr Shaw said he was confident of holding on in tomorrow's seven-way fight.
Latest canvassing returns gave him 44 per cent across this highly disparate
constituency, down only two per cent from last time, he said - pouring scorn
on recent telephone polls by local newspapers putting Labour well ahead.
Mr Prosser says that there is sufficient anger in the town over rising
unemployment that he will score a majority of at least 3,000. He underlines
the need to concentrate resources on bringing in new industrial investment,
and even talks of Dover applying for regional aid. Whoever wins, Dover's
future will not be plain sailing.

FT  08 APR 92 / Election 1992: Ashdown presses on electoral reform
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR PADDY Ashdown last night used his biggest campaign rally, which attracted
1,500 people, to call for a mandate to reform Britain's political system. He
warned that the Tories were 'playing on division and conflict'.
Seeking to energise Liberal Democrat activists ahead of tomorrow's polling,
Mr Ashdown said his party, 'can now give Britain the leadership it so
desperately needs' and predicted widespread Liberal Democrat wins in the
south-west, particularly Cornwall.
However, his upbeat speech in St Austell, Cornwall, jarred with the private
acknowledgment by Mr Ashdown's aides of the difficulties a hung parliament
could cause the party.
The Liberal Democrat leader refuses to call publicly for a hung parliament,
which would offer a third party the first chance to influence the government
for 15 years, but almost simultaneously says the chance to form a coalition
government presents a historic opportunity to form a government based on
consensus.
Sir David Steel, former Liberal leader who helped forge the 1977-78 Lib/Lab
pact, yesterday said that inflation had then fallen from 20 per cent to
under 9 per cent while share prices rose the day the pact was announced,
'not because they liked the Lib/Lab pact but because they welcomed the
stability'.
However, colleagues of Mr Ashdown made clear that he was not looking for a
repetition of 1977-78, which failed to bring significant gains for the
Liberals except in delaying a general election. He prefers 'partnership'
government, including ministerial posts for Liberal Democrats.
Sir David also rebuffed reports that he might not vote against a Labour
minority government's Queen's Speech if it included Scottish devolution but
not PR.

FT  08 APR 92 / Iraq-Kuwait border team delays report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK NICHOLSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE United Nations commission demarcating Kuwait's northern border with
Iraq, as part of the Gulf war ceasefire agreement, is unlikely to deliver
its final decision on the boundary until June at the earliest, officials
close to the commission said yesterday.
The five-member UN team convenes today in New York for a meeting after which
it had been expected to announce its findings.
Although the team is understood to have reached agreement on four sections
of the 200km (125-mile) disputed border between the two countries, observers
of the commission's work say the team may require a further meeting.
The commission will continue meeting until April 20. It is working to
determine the exact position on the ground of the international boundary
that was agreed by Iraq and Kuwait in a 1963 exchange of minutes, and which
was based itself on a loose definition of the border made in 1932.
The team is expected to mark a line to the north of the de facto Iraq-Kuwait
border before Iraq's invasion of the emirate in 1990 - a line likely to lie
north of several Iraqi-drilled oil wells in the Rumaila oil field and
expected to cut across the Iraqi Umm Qasr naval base.

THAILAND'S army commander, General Suchinda Kraprayoon, who did not stand in
last month's general election, was appointed prime minister yesterday as
opposition parties and civil rights activists continued their campaign for
an elected premier.
He pledged to continue with the liberal economic policies of his
predecessor, Mr Anand Panyarachun, and to emphasise the role of the private
sector. Gen Suchinda, who was de facto leader of last year's coup d'etat,
had picked Mr Anand.
The constitution allows a non-elected prime minister, but Gen Suchinda will
have to resign from military service.
Business leaders were generally muted in their reaction to his appointment.
They said they were more interested in who would be finance minister and
what policies would be adopted. The new premier has yet to appoint his
cabinet.
Some expressed relief that a two-week impasse over the premiership had
ended. Initially the five parties that now back Gen Suchinda had proposed Mr
Narong Wongwan, the leader of the largest party. But his candidacy aroused
strong opposition because he had been refused entry to the US for alleged
associations with drug trafficking.
Four opposition parties yesterday reaffirmed their objection to a
non-elected premier and vowed they would oppose his appointment.

<TEXT>
JIANG ZEMIN, the Chinese Communist party general secretary, yesterday used a
visit to Tokyo as a platform for an attack on the US, which he condemned for
its 'interference in the internal affairs' of other countries.
Jiang did not name Washington, but his speech was a clear reference to
continued US criticism of China's human rights record and arms export
policies. He said the international political situation had changed, but
'hegemony and power politics remain a serious problem'.
Having berated the US, Jiang told Japanese leaders they had an important
role in helping China's economic reform programme, and he invited Emperor
Akihito to visit Beijing this year as part of celebrations to mark the 20th
anniversary of the restoration of diplomatic relations between the two
countries.
Jiang is the first top-level Chinese leader to visit Japan since Premier Li
Peng in April 1989. A few months later, China's army crushed the
pro-democracy movement in Beijing, and Japan joined the West in freezing
high-level exchanges with China.
Japan has led the West in gradually restoring contacts, including foreign
aid.
Last year, Mr Toshiki Kaifu, who was then Japanese prime minister, became
the first leader of a major western power to visit Beijing after the
crackdown.
The Communist party chief and Japanese leaders yesterday implicitly agreed
to overlook Beijing's crushing of the pro-democracy movement and Mr Kiichi
Miyazawa, Japan's prime minister, indicated that his country's two most
important partners were Beijing and Washington.
But the warmth of the relationship has limits. The Japanese government
appears reluctant to approve the emperor's Beijing visit when the two
countries are unable to settle a dispute over the ownership of a collection
of East China Sea islands, known to Tokyo as the Senkaku islands, and to
Beijing as the Diaoyutai group.
In Beijing, Jiang's five-day visit to Tokyo is seen as an important step
towards domestic and international credibility for the Chinese leadership.

IRAQ yesterday told United Nations inspectors that it would accede to their
demand to destroy buildings and equipment at the al-Atheer complex near
Baghdad - which UN experts say was central to Iraq's nuclear weapons
programme.
Mr Dimitri Perricos, who arrived in Baghdad with other International Atomic
Energy Agency experts only yesterday, said the Iraqi government had said
'they have agreed to all proposals and decisions of the agency regarding the
destruction of specified buildings in the al-Atheer site'.
Mr Perricos said he will lead his team to al-Atheer today to begin work on
the demolition. His inspectors are also set to visit 16 other sites said to
be related to Iraq's nuclear weapons programme.
Iraq's early decision not to resist the team's call to destroy parts of the
al-Atheer site is the clearest demonstration yet of Baghdad's improved
co-operation with UN inspectors charged with identifying and eliminating its
nuclear and weapons programmes.

FT  08 APR 92 / UN envoy in 'frank' talks with Gadaffi
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY WALKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A UNITED NATIONS envoy had 'frank' talks with Libyan leader Colonel Muammer
Gadaffi in Tripoli yesterday on the UN intention to impose sanctions unless
Libya hands over the two suspected Lockerbie bombers.
The meeting came after noisy demonstrators blocked the UN envoy's motorcade
and assailed him in his hotel. One of the demonstrators died from injuries
received in a clash with police firing tear gas, according to the official
Libyan newsagency, Jana.
The envoy, Mr Vladimir Petrovsky, undersecretary-general for political
affairs, declined to give details of his meeting with Col Gadaffi. 'The
talks were frank, serious and businesslike,' the envoy told reporters.
He said he would report to Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the UN
secretary-general in Geneva today.
The demonstrations did not augur well for renewed attempts being made by
Arab League foreign ministers in Cairo last night to find a compromise to
end Libya's bitter dispute with the world community.
The special committee of seven ministers from Egypt, Algeria, Tunisia,
Syria, Libya, Mauritania and Morocco was formed several weeks ago to defuse
the Libyan crisis, but it has been ineffectual.
Mr Amr Moussa, Egypt's foreign minister, told reporters after a morning's
informal talks there were 'many proposals' on the table. But privately Arab
League officials are pessimistic about a successful outcome to their latest
mediation efforts.
'The aim of the committee is to contain the situation, confirm the Arab
position opposing terrorism, solve the problem in the framework of
international sovereignty and provide a solution which all parties will
agree to,' Mr Moussa added.
One proposal is for Libya to hand over the two accused men to the Arab
League, which would act as conduit for their eventual surrender to UK or US
authorities for trial. The UN secretary-general would also be involved in
such a transfer.
But in Tripoli at the weekend, Col Gadaffi was adamant that unless the men
voluntarily gave themselves up, he would not hand them over. Libya would
never surrender its 'sons', he declared.
The UN Security Council last week decided to impose an air and arms embargo
on Libya from April 15 unless it extradites the two men blamed for the
bombing of the Pan Am jet over Lockerbie in Scotland in 1988.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Bush Administration, after 18 months of intensive investigation by its
Customs Service, has brought a civil complaint against Mr Carlos Cardoen,
the Chilean arms manufacturer, accusing him of money-laundering and
illegally exporting US material used to make cluster bombs for Iraq.
Ms Carol Hallet, customs commissioner, said the US filed a legal action to
seize Dollars 33m of bank accounts and Florida properties owned by Mr
Cardoen because of the illegal exports.
Ms Hallet said Mr Cardoen was accused of illegally shipping from the US to
Chile about 100 tonnes of munitions-grade zirconium, a key metal used in
making cluster bombs. Teledyne Wah Chung, an Oregon company, was named as
the zirconium supplier in the suit. No charges have been filed against
Teledyne.
The US government suit states that Mr Cardoen - a mysterious figure who was
Saddam Hussein's biggest supplier of cluster bombs and factory technology -
laundered more than Dollars 200m of profits from cluster bomb sales through
Geneva and Miami. Some profits were used to buy Florida property.
Mr Cardoen has had an ambiguous relationship with the US and last year
denied having worked with the Central Intelligence Agency to clandestinely
channel military products to Iraq. At a Miami press conference, US officials
said they found no evidence of meetings between Mr Cardoen and Mr Robert
Gates, CIA director who himself denied reports of such meetings.
Ms Hallet described Mr Cardoen as 'one of the world's most notorious
merchants of death.' But a joint investigation by the Financial Times and
ABC News/Nightline last year uncovered an April 1987 cable from the US
embassy in Santiago to Washington in which Mr Cardoen was described as 'a
responsible recipient of US products.'

FT  08 APR 92 / World Trade News: EC proposes quota for banana imports
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Commission last night decided to risk a clash with its Gatt
partners and propose an EC-wide quota, rather than a tariff, on banana
imports from central America.
The quota plan will be welcomed by banana growers inside the EC, such as
Madeira, Canaries, Crete, and in the French and former British Carribbean
islands, as a more effective means of maintaining their position in the EC
market than with purely a tariff.
They fear that so-called 'dollar' bananas from central Europe are so much
cheaper to grow than the EC or Caribbean counterpart that the effect of even
a hefty tariff could always be neutralised.
The Commission described last night's proposal, which must now be considered
by EC governments, as the 'least bad' one.
The EC executive had to try to meet conflicting aims of:
Creating a single post-1992 regime for the highly fragmented EC banana
market. Countries such as the UK, France, Spain and Portugal import bananas
duty free under special arrangement from their own producers or former
colonies. Most of the rest of the EC pays a 20 per cent tariff on dollar
bananas, though Germany imports dollar bananas duty free.
Respecting assurances given to Caribbean producers in the Lome Convention
that they would not lose out as the result of any post-1992 system.
Winning acceptance in Gatt, where the EC will have to get a waiver of trade
rules for a new EC-wide quota (of which Brussels has yet to set the level).
Not penalising EC consumers. The Commission is proposing to extend the 20
per cent tariff that exists in much of the EC to Germany, but it argues that
if the quota for dollar bananas is large enough, this will not much raise
the cost of the fruit to Germans.

FT  08 APR 92 / Volatile Fujimori's step back is a lonely one: The air of a
return to the bad old days in much of Latin America is more apparent than
real
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN FIDLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE dissolution of Peru's congress by President Alberto Fujimori, two months
after a failed military coup in Venezuela, has re-awakened images of Latin
America's autocratic past.
The Peruvian president's apparent extra-constitutional act also cast a pall
over the general air of optimism surrounding the annual meeting of the
Inter-American Development Bank in Santo Domingo in the Dominican Republic.
The meeting yesterday celebrated an important debt breakthrough for
Argentina, the region's third-largest debtor after Brazil and Mexico, but
was left pondering the problems for democracy in the region created by the
economic reform movements that have swept the continent.
However, the air of a return to the bad old days is more apparent than real.
Latin America, unlike in the 1970s, is overwhelmingly a democratic
continent. The Rio Group of the 11 main Latin American governments joined
the widespread unequivocal international condemnation of Mr Fujimori's move.
'It's become very hard to argue in Latin America that you are taking
extra-constitutional action for a good cause,' said one official in Santo
Domingo.
There is a significant similarity between Peru and Venezuela - in all South
America they have perhaps the most underdeveloped political systems. One
academic in Washington last week described Venezuela as 'a city state with
an oil well'. The very idea of the nation is very weak in Peru.
However, an unravelling of the events in Peru and Venezuela, where a high
level of anxiety continues about further military challenges to the
government of President Carlos Andres Perez, shows important differences.
The Venezuelan coup attempt was triggered in large part by special factors
in the military largely unrelated to the government's economic programme
supported by the International Monetary Fund.
Events may yet derail the programme, but there appears to be a strong
realisation that if there were compromises to satisfy perceived political
pressure, there would be costs to other parts of society.
In Peru on the other hand, if Mr Fujimori's statements are to be believed,
the actions of this elected leader were taken to defend and deepen his
economic programme. The condemnation of his move externally contrasts
strongly with the apparently favourable reaction inside the country.
Nonetheless, Mr Fujimori's attempt to deepen economic reform may well be
frustrated by the suspension of aid and other financial and technical
assistance from important donors, in particular the US and Japan. Unless he
moves quickly to restore constitutional order, Peru risks becoming once more
as isolated internationally as it was under the populist government of
President Alan Garcia.
In this respect, the international community can have a significant
influence. Peru is heavily dependent on newly re-established financial flows
from the international community and the threat of effective sanctions could
have a significant impact.
This may provide some comfort to governments all over a continent that has
been wringing its hands over the inability to restore Haiti's short-lived
democracy.
This sense of helplessness had been reinforced by the hypothetical
difficulties which many saw in putting international pressure on a military
government in Venezuela. Since Venezuela is the second-largest supplier of
oil to the US and is the US's second-largest market in Latin America,
sanctions against it would have a far greater economic cost to Washington
than the action taken against an economically-backward Haiti.
In short, unless Mr Fujimori's action was meant either to pre-empt the army
or to be short-lived, he may have miscalculated. He has a reputation as a
lonely and volatile man: outbursts at the recent Latin American drugs summit
in San Antonio, Texas, surprised the other leaders present.
'Fujimori is no Machiavelli,' said one Peruvian in Santo Domingo yesterday.

FT  08 APR 92 / Peru's military to crack down on guerrillas
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SALLY BOWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PERU'S military looks set for a swift crackdown against the country's
guerrillas and drugs traffickers following President Alberto Fujimori's
dissolution of Congress in favour of a military-backed 'government of
emergency and national reconstruction.'
Troops were reported yesterday to be standing ready for action in the Upper
Huallaga Valley, north-east of Lima, where Sendero Luminoso, the Maoist
guerrilla group, and drugs traffickers have long held sway.
The crackdown on Peru's press intensified yesterday, with the closure of the
leading news magazine Caretas, as it became clearer that the opposition
American Popular Revolutionary Alliance (Apra) was the key target of Sunday
night's government-armed forces strike.
Mr Agustin Mantilla and Mr Abel Salinas, former Apra interor and economy
ministers, have been arrested along with Mr Luis Negreiros, a leading Apra
trade union figure. Mr Alan Garcia, the former president and recently
re-elected Apra secretary general, has slipped the net.
Mr Fujimori said last night that today 'security forces would be removed
from all news media who in reality were there to provide protection'.
Diplomatic sources said the president intended to put his emergency measures
to a plebiscite within six weeks.
The armed forces, underpaid, ill-equipped and constantly accused of human
rights violations, have long been agitating for a freer hand in dealing with
Peru's two principal subversive groups. 'President Fujimori is obsessed with
achieving the pacification of Peru,' said a political analyst in Lima. 'He
sees insurgency as the main stumbling block to attracting foreign investment
and believes that only by giving the army its head will he achieve this.'
'By militarising the country further he is simply playing into Sendero's
hands - it's just what they've always wanted,' said another analyst.
Mr Fujimori lamented the 'lack of international comprehension' of his
actions in a speech on Monday night, but hoped this would change when his
measures were fully understood.
'This is not a traditional coup d'etat but a change of course which reflects
the true aspirations of the Peruvian people,' he said.
However, international condemnation of Peru's actions intensified yesterday.
President George Bush ordered suspension of some Dollars 320m in US economic
and military aid to Peru, according to an official.
Mr David Mulford, US Treasury undersecretary for international affairs, said
yesterday at the meeting of the Inter-American Development Bank in Santo
Domingo that the US might vote against new multilateral aid for Peru.
cabinet on Monday night. Ministers stood by their president, some looking
enthusiastic, others unhappy. A prominent absentee was former premier Mr
Alfonso de los Heros, who resigned to be replaced as chief minister by the
low-key Mr Oscar de la Puente Reygada.

FT  08 APR 92 / Ozone losses up to 20%

<TEXT>
THE atmosphere over Europe lost 15 to 20 per cent of its protective ozone
layer during the winter but it does not have a full-scale 'ozone hole', an
international scientific team said yesterday.
The team said, however, that within a decade, winter ozone losses over the
northern hemisphere would be double the level of the end of the 1980s.
Results from the European Arctic Stratospheric Ozone Experiment (Easoe) show
that ozone levels reached a record low over much of the northern hemisphere
in January, as chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) chemicals combined with natural
pollutants from the Mount Pinatubo volcanic eruption to create 'highly
perturbed conditions' in the stratosphere.
The Easoe scientists said the ozone loss was more serious than they expected
when the Pounds 14m experiment started in the autumn.
But it does not match the most alarming predictions made two months ago when
Easoe and Nasa, the US space agency, released preliminary measurements of
ozone destruction; some environmental specialists said then that an Arctic
ozone hole could develop this spring.
An Antarctic hole started to appear annually in the 1980s because of CFCs
building up in the atmosphere. This has increased the amount of harmful
ultraviolet radiation from the sun reaching the ground in the southern
spring. However, the northern hemisphere ozone layer recovered slightly in
February and March, with levels 5 to 15 per cent down on the long-term
average.
Although no Arctic ozone hole will appear this year, according to Easoe,
'scientists have seen conditions which could lead to an ozone hole if a
future winter was longer and colder - and especially as stratospheric
chlorine (from CFCs pollution in the upper atmosphere) is expected to
increase into the next century.'
Scientists on the UK-based European Ozone Secretariat, which co-ordinates
Easoe, say their findings add urgency to United Nations negotiations to
bring forward a global ban on CFCs and related chemicals under the Montreal
protocol. A ministerial meeting planned for November in Copenhagen is
expected to agree to phase out ozone-destroying chemicals by the beginning
of 1996.
Environmental groups Greenpeace and Friends of the Earth said the latest
evidence supported their demands for an immediate ban on CFC production.

<TEXT>
ITALIAN POLITICIANS turned their attention yesterday to the problems of
forming a new government after Sunday's general election left the outgoing
four-party coalition with only 47 per cent of the vote.
The election result was a sharp rebuff to Italy's long-running Christian
Democrat authority and has created an unprecedented fragmentation of
parliament. Senior ministers readily conceded this situation had opened up
grave uncertainties about the country's governability.
'What people have called an earthquake is indeed true,' said Mr Enzo Scotti,
the Christian Democrat interior minister, commenting on the final results.
'Our country now faces institutional problems, delicate problems of
governability linked to the decisions concerning institutional reform which
will now have to be taken on board.'
Newspaper headlines yesterday proclaimed: 'in search of an impossible
government', 'the wall of the Christian Democrats has fallen', 'nomenclatura
dismissed', and 'four-party coalition buried without heirs'.
These reflected the mix of drama and confusion in the face of a protest vote
that saw support switch from the Christian Democrats and their main
Socialist allies to a range of parties across the political spectrum.
Final results showed that 16 parties would be represented in the chamber of
deputies. Of these, 12 held less than 6 per cent of the vote and only the
Christian Democrats more than 20 per cent.
The populist Lombard League emerged as the main new force, capturing 9 per
cent of the vote nationwide and becoming the second largest party in
northern Italy.
Mr Giulio Andreotti, the outgoing premier, is due to present his resignation
later this week to be followed on April 23 by the first meeting of the new
legislature. Between April 27 and April 30 the new parliamentary group is
due to be formed. Only when this has been completed will it be possible to
talk seriously of the formation of a new government in what could prove a
lengthy process.
President Francesco Cossiga has pledged to begin informal soundings as soon
as possible.

GENERAL Colin Powell, chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff, yesterday
pledged a continuing US military commitment to Europe but told Europeans
they would have to make it clear they wanted US troops to remain, writes
David White.
US congressional support for the forces also depended on allies' willingness
to take a 'more equitable' share of the defence burden and back US
operations outside the Nato area, he warned.
Speaking at the annual Alastair Buchan Memorial Lecture at the International
Institute for Strategic Studies in London, he said: 'We are definitely here
to stay.' Despite a debate in the US on the size of its forces in Europe -
due to be halved to 150,000  - there was no disagreement on the need for a
'forward presence'.

SERB leaders yesterday declared an independent Serbian republic within
Bosnia-Hercegovina, the ethnically mixed Yugoslav republic, following the
European Community's decision on Monday to recognise Bosnia's independence.
Serbs in the republic, where there was further ethnic violence yesterday,
fear becoming a minority in an independent Bosnia-Hercegovina, separated
from Serbs elsewhere in the former federation.
Yugoslav air force jets were reported yesterday to have launched two strikes
against targets in western Bosnia. Five people were killed when jets
attacked the predominantly Croat towns of Listica and Citluk, according to
emergency council officials in Siroki Brijeg, in the south-west.
The federal air force said the attacks were launched in response to
provocations on 'hostile military targets' controlled by local Croat units.
Radio Sarajevo reported fierce clashes around Mostar, 20 miles north-east of
Listica, where the federal army said the airport came under attack.
The resignation of Serbs from Bosnia's collective leadership yesterday
sparked fears of deepening turmoil. Mrs Biljana Plavsic and Mr Nikola
Koljevic, the two Serb representatives, resigned after declaring an
independent Serbian republic. They said the Serbian Republic would remain in
Yugoslavia, joining Serbia and its ally, Montenegro.
The resignations cast doubt on the continued participation of Serb leaders
in EC-brokered peace talks due to resume on April 10. The UN Security
Council last night strongly endorsed EC efforts to end the conflict in
Bosnia-Hercegovina. The council decided unanimously that UN peacekeeping
troops in Yugoslavia, some of which are already in place, be brought to full
strength of 14,000 as soon as possible.
Yesterday the US joined the EC in recognising the independence of
Bosnia-Hercegovina, and of Croatia and Slovenia. The EC decided on Monday to
recognise Bosnia and to lift sanctions against Serbia.
Dozens of Moslems, Serbs, and Croats - Bosnia's main ethnic groups - have
died in the past week as Bosnia's national leaders have failed to agree on a
constitution. Most Serbs, who make up a third of the 4.4m population, oppose
an independent Bosnia. The Moslems and Croats favour independence.
European observers yesterday agreed the Serb-controlled army will play a key
role in determining the course of events in Bosnia amid growing signs that
the army has distributed weapons and redeployed troops in Serb-populated
areas.
Meanwhile Sarajevo, the capital, was placed under curfew.

THE ROW between Russia and Ukraine over possession of the Black Sea fleet
escalated dangerously yesterday when Russia issued a decree claiming nominal
control.
Under the decree, signed by Russian President Boris Yeltsin, the fleet,
comprising some 300 ships, will be funded by Russia but will remain under
the joint military command of the 11-nation Commonwealth of Independent
States.
The Russian move followed an identical decree issued by Ukraine earlier in
the week and raised the prospect of the fleet's commanders being forced to
answer to two conflicting authorities.
Marshal Yevgeny Shaposhnikov, head of the CIS armed forces, told the
Congress of Russian People's Deputies yesterday that the decree would put
the fleet under the jurisdiction of Russia, though 'operational control'
would still be vested in the CIS.
Admiral Igor Kasotonov, the fleet's commander, warned against 'parallel
structures of command'.
The earlier decree signed by Mr Leonid Kravchuk, the Ukrainian president,
takes the fleet under the Ukrainian Defence Ministry, and brings all
strategic nuclear forces under Ukrainian administrative control, though
operational command is to remain with the CIS.
Mr Volodymyr Pylypchuk, chairman of Ukraine's parliamentary commission on
economic reform, said that 'by making this statement Yeltsin is drawing us
into a state of war with Russia'.
He said Ukraine's claim was based on the fact that the fleet was largely
stationed on Ukrainian territory and that Russia had no right to claim
military forces located in a foreign country.
Mr Yeltsin told the Congress that the Russian army would take over all CIS
forces in other republics and abroad (in Poland and former East Germany).
Although Mr Yeltsin did not say so, it is clearly envisaged that the
strategic forces will also be put under Russian command, threatening further
confrontation with Ukraine.
Praising the decision to take the CIS forces nominally under his command
under Russian control, Marshal Shaposhnikov said that it would raise morale
and confirm Russian statehood. 'An army without a state is not an army, and
a state without an army is not a state,' he said.
The Ukrainian parliament is scheduled to debate today in closed session,
laws which would further extend its control over the strategic nuclear
weapons.
The draft laws call on the Cabinet of Ministers to take immediate action to
give Ukraine technical blocking power over the firing of nuclear weapons.
Western experts and Ukrainian officials say it is technically possible to
develop veto power over the use of nuclear weapons on its territory.

FT  08 APR 92 / Ireland announces abortion referendum
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE IRISH government last night announced it intends to hold a new
referendum on abortion, focusing on women's right to travel abroad for an
abortion and to receive abortion information within Ireland.
The move follows the refusal by most of Ireland's EC partners just hours
earlier to amend a protocol to the Maastricht Treaty which protects
Ireland's constitutional ban on abortion. EC officials said Ireland's
request would 'open a Pandora's box' with other states also seeking changes
to the treaty.
No date has been fixed for the vote - Ireland's second abortion referendum
in nine years.
The issue is rapidly becoming a legal and political nightmare for the Irish
government. Two months ago, Mr Albert Reynolds, the prime minister, said
such a referendum was unnecessary and would be considered only 'as a last
resort'.
Mr Reynolds has come under increasing pressure from right-to-life
campaigners within his Fianna Fail party, to hold an abortion referendum,
following a Supreme Court ruling last month allowing a 14-year-old rape
victim to travel to Britain to terminate her pregnancy.
A High Court injunction had earlier prevented her from doing so, on the
basis of a 1983 constitutional amendment guaranteeing the right to life.
The Supreme Court ruling has effectively established the right to abortion
in Ireland for women who face a threat to their lives, including the threat
of suicide, but the judges also concluded that where such a threat to the
life of the mother does not exist, pregnant women seeking an abortion abroad
can legally be prevented from doing so.
Mr Alan Shatter, the justice spokesman for the opposition Fine Gael party
said he welcomed the government decision. Mr Dick Spring, Labour leader,
said the referendum should be held before the vote on Maastricht, set for
June.

FT  08 APR 92 / Delors signals more powers for Brussels
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   STRASBOURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BRUSSELS will soon recommend a startling increase in supranational executive
power for the EC as the necessary price for enlarging the Community, Mr
Jacques Delors signalled yesterday.
The Commission report on enlargement, due for the Lisbon summit, 'will come
as a political, intellectual and institutional shock to the Twelve (existing
members) who, in my opinion, have not sufficiently realised what a Community
opening up to 35 states would be like', he told MEPs.
So far, only six countries have asked to join the EC. But, in what is
perhaps an exaggeration to magnify the need for 'big bang' institutional
change, Mr Delors now evidently assumes far more states will soon knock at
Brussels' door.
Hitherto, proponents of minimal institutional change, like Britain, which
takes over the EC presidency later this year, had been rather counting on Mr
Delors to tone down the long-stated desire of Mr Frans Andriessen, the
external affairs commissioner, for EC integration to be 'deepened' as it is
'widened'.
But Mr Delors said yesterday: 'We must see that widening is not at the
expense of deepening.' A very preliminary draft of the enlargement report
dating back to last November suggested removing all member states' right to
have at least one Commissioner, cutting the voting threshold needed to pass
routine business through the Council of Ministers, and introducing 'a
genuine European executive . . . to implement external policy'.
MEPs last night voted by 226 to 63, with 31 abstentions, in favour of the
Maastricht treaty on political and monetary union, despite lengthy criticism
of its 'shortcomings'.
Though the Maastricht pact only needs ratification by the 12 national
parliaments, two of the latter - the Belgian and Italian legislatures - have
said they will heed Strasbourg's views. But any enlargement of the EC
requires the approval of MEPs, who last night put on record their
pre-condition that the EC's 'democratic deficit' must be remedied before new
countries join it.
The European People's Party (EPP) of 122 Christian Democrat MEPs last night
voted by a two-to-one majority to admit as full members the 32-strong band
of UK Tory MEPs, plus two Danish conservatives.
This ends the isolation - especially marked during the Thatcher years - of
Tory MEPs who will now be part of one of Strasbourg's two big battalions.
The largest is the 180-strong Socialist group.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
UKRAINE has agreed on terms to join the International Monetary Fund and
hopes to become a fully-fledged member of the Washington-based institution
by the beginning of next month, writes George Graham in Washington.
Mr Hryhory Pyatachenko, Ukraine's finance minister, said he had accepted the
IMF quota of 0.69 per cent which had been proposed to him, though Ukrainian
officials said they were disappointed that it was not higher.
This quota would give the former Soviet republic access to IMF financing of
up to approximately Dollars 1bn a year. If the IMF can complete its Dollars
60bn quota increase - an operation which is currently held up by the US's
refusal to authorise its Dollars 12bn share - this financial access would
increase to approximately Dollars 1.5bn a year.
Russia, the largest of the former Soviet republics, agreed earlier this
month on a quota of 3 per cent.
Mr Michel Camdessus, managing director of the IMF, complimented the
Ukrainian government after his meeting with Mr Pyatachenko on its
'commitment to a market economy and to the integration of Ukraine into the
international economic community'. He also welcomed Ukraine's decision to
accept joint responsibility for the debt of the former Soviet Union, a move
which he said 'can only enhance Ukraine's standing in the eyes of the
international financial community'.

FT  08 APR 92 / Business election fears grow: Executives say Labour win
would hit pound and force interest rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN OVERWHELMING majority of Britain's business leaders believe Mr Neil
Kinnock will be forced to put up interest rates to support a weakening pound
if Labour wins tomorrow's general election.
An FT-Mori poll of senior executives carried out at the start of this week
suggests that Mr John Smith's shadow Budget has done nothing to assuage the
anxieties of most companies about Labour's economic strategy.
More than a third expected their companies' investment spending in Britain
to fall if Mr Kinnock becomes prime minister.
The survey, conducted among directors of the FT's top 500 companies in the
UK, suggests that businessmen are more worried now than at the beginning of
the campaign about the implications of a Labour victory.
The survey, coinciding with two national opinion polls suggesting that Mr
Kinnock remains set to emerge as the leader of the largest party in a hung
parliament, also reveals the business community's deep concern about the
impact on confidence of a hung parliament.
Its conclusions followed a strong warning by Mr John Major that a
Conservative victory was a precondition for the economic recovery now in
sight. Senior ministers said Mr Major was resting his hopes - defying the
opinion polls - on a last-minute surge in public concern about Labour's tax
and economic policies.
But Mr Smith, setting out Labour's plans for new incentives for training and
investment as part of a national recovery programme, warned that a
re-elected Conservative government would turn recession into slump.
Ninety-six per cent of the executives polled believed interest rates would
rise, while 83 per cent said that Mr Kinnock's entrance to Downing Street
would herald a fall in the pound. That compares with the 76 per cent who
predicted higher interest rates and the 75 per cent who foresaw a falling
pound in the first wave of the FT-Mori survey on March 11 and 12, before Mr
Smith unveiled his tax package.
The executives' anxieties, however, were not shared on foreign exchange
markets, where sterling yesterday made some ground on the D-Mark as
investors appeared to take a more sanguine view of a Conservative defeat.
Investors switched money into sterling on calculations that a Labour
administration or a hung parliament was unlikely to lead to large-scale
selling of the pound.
Of executives responding, 38 per cent said their planned investment in
Britain would fall under a Labour government, against 26 per cent making
that prediction in the first survey.
Almost all the executives - 94 per cent of those willing to give a voting
intention - intend to back the Conservatives, 45 per cent citing Mr Smith's
plans to raise tax bills of the higher paid as a significant factor. Before
Labour unveiled its proposals for a 50p top rate of income tax and abolition
of the ceiling on National Insurance Contributions, only 27 per cent cited
personal taxation as a key issue.
Some 22 per cent said Labour's higher tax rates would mean they were likely
to work less hard, and 48 per cent thought Mr Smith's tax package would
reduce work incentives for their middle management.
The poll underlines growing concern in the business community about the
implications of an inconclusive result. Some 88 per cent say that a hung
parliament would be bad for the country and 80 per cent are concerned that
it would damage their business.

FT  08 APR 92 / Major asks floating voters to trust his leadership
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY and ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN MAJOR last night put his own personality at the centre of the
Tories' final appeal to the electorate in an effort to reverse Labour's
continuing 2 to 3 point opinion poll lead.
Using a party election broadcast and a rally at Wembley, he called on
undecided voters to examine his record and to trust his leadership with a
fourth Conservative term of government.
Describing Mr Neil Kinnock as 'grasping desperately at the prospect of
power', he said Britons could be proud of the country's record since 1979
and went on to warn against the 'dead end' of socialism. Tory pamphlets
attacking Mr Kinnock's leadership abilities will be delivered to targeted
voters today.
In an emotional plea to voters, Mr Major said: 'I've only just begun the
tasks I have set myself. On Thursday I ask this nation to look at my record
of service and my ideals for the future, to place their trust in me and in
this party that has served them so well and so faithfully.'
With less than 36 hours before voting begins, Mr Kinnock retaliated at a
Blackburn rally with a withering attack on the Conservatives' economic
record and a warning that the National Health Service would be in 'mortal
danger' if the Tories were returned to power. 'I say to the British people -
after all they have done, they simply do not deserve to be re-elected,' he
said, repeating his claim that the election would be a 'referendum' on the
NHS's future.
In Cornwall, Mr Paddy Ashdown, the Liberal Democrat leader, used his
penultimate rally to attack the Tories for 'playing on division and
conflict', pledging to use the election outcome to reform the political
system.
The 11th hour manoeuvring came as the smaller political parties including
the Ulster Unionists and Plaid Cymru hinted that they would be ready to work
with a minority government.
Two polls last night showed Labour's support running at 2 and 3 points ahead
of the Conservatives, still short of the lead required to win 326 seats -
the total needed for an overall majority. A Harris survey for ITN showed
Labour 2 points ahead on 40 points, the Conservatives on 38 and the Liberal
Democrats on 18, a significant narrowing of a 5-point gap between the two
main parties last week.
A Mori poll for Channel 4's First Tuesday programme had Labour leading by 3
points on 40, with the Conservatives on 37 and the Liberal Democrats on 20.
In Scotland, there was clear evidence of a sharp decline in backing for full
independence. An ICM poll for The Scotsman showed support for the Labour and
Liberal Democrats' proposal for a Scottish parliament rising by 8 points to
42 as the Scottish Nationalists' separatist policy fell by the same margin
to 23 points.
There was little comfort for the Conservatives, however. In spite of Mr
Major's appeal for backing for the Union on Monday, those supporting the
status quo dropped by 1 point to 24.
Last night, Mr Michael Heseltine launched a last-minute plea to Scots at an
Edinburgh rally to stand by the 'great partnership' and back the
Conservatives. Earlier, Mr Major had apparently acknowledged Labour's lead
by telling Tory workers that the party would 'surprise people' tomorrow.

FT  08 APR 92 / GM coup promotes ex-chief of Procter &amp; Gamble
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NON-EXECUTIVE directors of General Motors, the struggling US car
manufacturer, have staged a palace coup, reducing the power of the company's
chairman and demoting his chief lieutenant in an effort to speed a return to
profitability.
The move is a severe rebuke for Mr Robert Stempel, GM chairman for the past
20 months, who retains the title but has been replaced as chairman of the
board's important executive committee, which oversees the running of the
company between board meetings.
His place has been taken by Mr John Smale, a former chairman of consumer
products group Procter &amp; Gamble, who has been on the GM board for a decade
and is believed to have played a central role in encouraging the board
shake-up.
The board announced late on Monday that it had replaced Mr Lloyd Reuss, GM's
55-year-old president and Mr Stempel's long-time lieutenant, with Mr John
('Jack') Smith, head of GM's international operations. Mr Smith has also
been appointed chief operating officer, a title the board declined to give
Mr Reuss when it reluctantly appointed him president in 1990 on Mr Stempel's
insistence.
Mr Reuss, who is responsible for GM's North American car business, has been
widely criticised for the severity of its operating losses, which totalled
some Dollars 7bn (Pounds 4bn) in 1991. Only two months ago Mr Stempel,
responding to rumours that Mr Reuss might be ousted, insisted that 'Lloyd's
my man'.
Mr Smith, 54, is a former chief of GM's European operations who won praise
in the mid-1980s for helping turn that business from losses into Europe's
most profitable large manufacturer.
Mr Stempel has been trying to similarly shake-up GM's bureaucratic and
inefficient North American business and announced 70,000 job losses and 21
plant closures last December.
But the board's action shows it has grown frustrated at the pace
of change. It said in a statement: 'regaining profitability requires a more
aggressive management approach to remove excess costs'.
The board, which said its actions were approved by Mr Stempel, has also
demoted the company's chief financial officer, Mr Robert O'Connell, who
moves to head GM's finance arm, General Motors Acceptance Corp. He is
replaced by Mr William Hoglund, formerly in charge of components operations.
The moves were welcomed on Wall Street, where Mr Smith and Mr Hoglund are
highly regarded but Mr Reuss has long been unpopular. Analysts said the
shake-up should accelerate GM's existing restructuring plans and might make
them more radical.

FT  08 APR 92 / Wall St drives Japan lower
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JAPANESE EQUITIES opened lower early today following a sharp fall on Wall
Street overnight, write Our Markets Staff.
The unsettled start in Tokyo, which saw the Nikkei average of leading shares
more than 450 points lower in mid-morning, came after the Dow Jones
Industrial Average shed 61.94 to 3,213.55 last night.
The fall in US prices was sparked in part by the shake-out in Japanese
stocks in the previous session, when the Nikkei plunged 644.82 to 17,791.55
 -its lowest levels since November 1986. The drop on Wall Street also
reflected a big computerised sell program, wiping 20 points off the Dow.
Japanese brokers and businessmen saw little prospect of a recovery, after
last week's government spending package and a cut in the official discount
rate had failed to boost confidence.
'The stock market is now like a bottomless swamp,' Mr Yoshinari Yamashiro,
president of NKK, the steel company, told a press conference.
Any hope that last week's action by the authorities might restore market
confidence has been crushed by the selling of bank shares. Yesterday the
Nikkei average of bank stocks fell 6.9 per cent, against a 3.5 per cent
decline in the overall average.
In the past 10 days, bank shares have fallen by 20 per cent, the single
biggest element in a 12 per cent decline in the Nikkei. The market value of
Industrial Bank of Japan has fallen by 77 per cent from its peak of
Y15,000bn at the height of the bull market in December 1989.
Nevertheless, brokers report few signs of panic.

FT  08 APR 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TRADING in the derivatives market continued to be dominated by hedging as
traders tried to second guess the outcome of tomorrow's election, writes
Joel Kibazo.
In stock index futures, the June contract on the FTSE was traded at a
healthy premium of 25 at the beginning of the session. But an early rise was
cut short by sellers, mostly independent traders as the large institutions
once again remained on the sidelines and June soon fell back to 2,422.
A brief rally, as several US houses went bargain hunting, was cut short by a
poor Wall Street opening.
Further falls were recorded towards the close as sizeable selling in the
traded options was hedged in the futures market.
June closed at 2,428, down 14 on the previous session and around two points
above its estimated fair value premium to cash of 22. Turnover reached 6,590
contracts.
In trade options, turnover returned to a more modest 24,466, down from
29,698 on Monday. Strong hedging business caused the FTSE option's daily
total to rise to 12,028 contracts. Among the stock options, Midland Bank led
the way with a day's total of 1,433 lots, followed by GEC at 1,135 lots.

FT  08 APR 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Oil shares stand out in
European trade
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OIL shares bucked a generally easier continental trend yesterday, writes Our
Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT consolidated Monday's gains and the DAX index, which had risen 10
points in early trading, closed 4.8 higher at 1,739.42. The FAZ index,
calculated at midsession, was 5.47 firmer at 711.49, while turnover fell to
DM6.7bn from DM7.1bn.
The banking sector remained in focus as Commerzbank announced its 1991
results. The shares advanced DM3.3 to DM262.0 before announcing a 70 per
cent rise in group operating profit for the first two months of this year.
Deutsche Bank finished 50 pfg stronger at DM718 and Dresdner Bank advanced
DM2.00 to DM353.50. BHF Bank, which releases its 1991 figures today, was DM2
higher at DM434. It said it would raise its dividend to DM13 from DM12.
Daimler rose to an intra day high of DM781 before closing DM6.50 ahead at
DM775.50 on rumours that it was to issue a covered warrant. BMW and
Volkswagen both lost ground after their recent strong gains. BMW shed DM2.70
to DM583.50 and Volkswagen declined 40 pfg to DM375.40.
News that the cartel office was to investigate the relationship between Asko
and Metro, a privately-owned Swiss group, shaved DM5 off Asko to DM883.
There were reports that Metro had doubled its declared 10 per cent stake in
Asko.
BASF advanced DM12.60 at DM258.00 in the absence of news.
MILAN ended lower across the board following the poor showing of the
coalition government - especially the Christian Democrats  - in the national
elections. Dealers said domestic funds initially tried to hold up the market
but soon gave up. The Comit index fell 8.19 or 1.6 per cent to 503.40 in
turnover estimated at little more than Monday's L63.8bn.
Analysts said that while another early election was unlikely, the market
would have little faith in a weak Christian Democrat-led alliance which
would usher in a period of political and economic instability. However, they
added that intrepid investors might consider buying Italian equities at
current depressed levels, in the hope that the inconclusive election results
would force Italy to reform its electoral process.
Fiat fell L53 to L4,770 and Generali lost L560 to L28,780. Telecoms fell as
foreign investors took their profits, with Sip losing L34 to L1,441 and Stet
down L63 to L2,148.
PARIS concentrated on individual stocks as the broad market was generally
flat. The CAC 40 index ended just 0.61 higher at 1,975.38 in turnover of
FFr2.2bn.
Alcatel Alsthom remained firm ahead of its 1991 results today, adding FFr4
to FFr623. A net profit figure above FFr5.9bn would be good news for the
market.
Firmer crude prices lifted the oil sector. Total gained FFr9.20 to FFr248.70
and Elf added FFr4 to FFr365.60.
There was some activity in Euro Disney which fell FFr2.60 to FFr148.90. The
theme park operator made a presentation to analysts and fund managers
yesterday which included a tour of the park which is due to open on
Saturday.
AMSTERDAM closed slightly down as Royal Dutch once more dominated trading. A
stronger oil price and a buy note from a US broker lifted the shares which
closed up Fl 2.10 at Fl 147.20. The CBS Tendency index fell 0.1 to 125.6 in
turnover of Fl 621.7m.
The transport group Pakhoed, which reported disappointing 1991 profits and
forecast that 1992 earnings would remain under pressure, fell to the day's
low of Fl 42.50 before closing down Fl 1.60 at Fl 43.70.
Nedlloyd declined 50 cents to Fl 58.80 and denied reports that it was
planning to cut jobs. Fokker denied a report that it was to make a statement
tomorrow on progress in its talks with Deutsche Aerospace, although analysts
expect an announcement in the near future. Its shares rose 10 cents to Fl
34.70.
ZURICH was unmoved by inflation figures which showed a rise of 0.3 per cent
between February and March. The SMI index closed 7.5 higher at 1,850.5.
Insurers remained active with registered shares in Swiss Re gaining SFr20 to
SFr2,490 and in Zurich Insurance SFr10 to SFr4,050.
BRUSSELS opened the first day of the new account firmer with the Bel-20
index closing up 3.62 at 1,188.27 in turnover of BFr805m. Petrofina was led
higher by the rise in the world oil price and advanced BFr100 to BFr10,500.
LISBON continued to rise on domestic and foreign interest following the
escudo's entry into the ERM. Liquid blue chips such as banking and
construction were in demand. The BTA index added 27.9 or 1.4 per cent to
2,080.4.
MADRID gained slightly although disappointing economic news depressed
sentiment. The general index closed up 0.05 at 248.92 in turnover of some
Pta14bn. Next week's inflation data is expected to show a month-on-month
rise of between 0.4-0.6 per cent.

FT  08 APR 92 / World Stock Markets: A dry season in prospect for
Johannesburg stocks - A nervous mood pervades the JSE
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The euphoria which accompanied the resounding referendum victory in South
Africa three weeks ago has been replaced by a nervous mood on the
Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE) as investors contemplate the fragility of
overseas markets and a number of negative factors on the domestic front.
Although a negative outcome of the referendum would have been a catastrophe
for the market, a positive outcome had been largely discounted. Analysts
agree that its effect was neutral, since it merely confirmed that the
country is addressing the complicated process of political negotiation, with
all the attendant uncertainties.
Buoyed by the strongly rising Dow Jones Industrial Average, the JSE
all-share index rose nearly 8 per cent in the first two weeks of January.
However, with the gold price slumping to a near six-year low in March, the
market lost a lot of its momentum. This was followed by a 2 per cent fall
last week as the JSE tracked the movements of the weak Japanese and London
markets.
The overall index closed at 3,440 yesterday, (the market was closed on
Monday for a public holiday), down 7.4 per cent from its 1992 high of 3,713
in mid-January.
Mr Roy McAlpine of Liberty Asset Management, the fund managers, comments:
'Everybody agreed that for the last few months the market looked fairly
frothy. In this situation, at any possible opportunity it is likely to have
a correction.' The weakness in the Nikkei average, he says, merely
precipitated what was bound to happen eventually.
Mr McAlpine observes that a frothy market in South Africa normally stops
people buying, but it doesn't make them sell out. Hence last week's
correction took place on fairly low volume. He also argues that the market
is technically strong in the sense that it is dominated by institutions
which hold most of the prime stock, and which tend to take a long-term view.
Two factors on the mining side have had a bearish influence on the market: a
very weak gold bullion price and a recent fall in the share price of De
Beers, which closed yesterday at R83.80, down from a year's high of R96.85.
De Beers dominates the JSE, making up nearly 10 per cent of the overall
index. Last year turnover in De Beers accounted for 11 per cent of total
turnover. The recent slide in its share price reflects poor prospects in
1992 which have led analysts to predict flat earnings for the year.
Two other recent events which failed to revive the JSE were the country's
budget, and the announcement by the Reserve Bank (central bank) of a 1 per
cent cut in interest rates. Mr Rob Lee of the Board of Executors investment
institution, says investors were disappointed by the budget, because
although it was expansionary, and hence good for short-term growth, it did
not contain fiscal incentives for business or individuals. The cut in
interest rates was widely discounted, so it had a negligible effect.
Of potential benefit for foreign investors was the recent announcement by
the Reserve Bank that it plans to intervene in the volatile financial rand
market. If the bank succeeds in narrowing the discount between the
investment currency and the commercial rand, this would offer a currency
appreciation for foreigners, thus making the JSE more attractive. It is too
early, however, to properly assess the implications of the Bank's
announcement.
One potential threat to market prices, which is being ignored for now, is
the country's severe drought which economists estimate will knock at least
0.5 per cent off economic growth this year. Mr McAlpine notes that
historically there has been little correlation between GDP growth and the
performance of the JSE.
Analysts agree that shares are looking fully priced until there is evidence
of an economic upturn, which is not expected until later in the year.
Although there is unanimity that 1992 will not see the industrial index rise
again by 40 per cent, as in 1991, there is also a widespread belief that the
country's longer term prospects are good, and that the stock market will
continue to reflect this.

FT  08 APR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Overfishing crisis threatens
rift, Canada warns EC - The escalating war of words associated with an
explosive foreign policy issue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEN WARN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE WAR of words over what Canada claims is foreign overfishing outside its
waters is reaching new levels of intensity. 'This is the most explosive
foreign policy issue that Canada faces,' warned Mr John Crosbie, fisheries
minister, last month. 'Failure to reach a settlement this year could lead to
a major breach in our relations with the European Community.'
As Canada steps up its rhetoric, the EC in turn appears to be becoming more
entrenched. 'It is ludicrous to claim that the EC is responsible for the
decline in fish stocks,' an official said last week. 'We cannot be the
object of such slander any more.'
Mr Crosbie said that the issue would be Canada's main concern at the Earth
summit in Rio de Janeiro this June. 'Rio really is our last shot to resolve
this by the diplomatic route.'
Since 1989, Canada has waged a campaign against the activities of EC vessels
 -particularly from Spain and Portugal  - immediately outside its 200-mile
territorial limit, accusing them of depleting stocks.
In February, Canada slashed its own total allowable catch (TAC) for northern
cod, the most important stock of the Atlantic fishery, by 35 per cent to
120,000 tonnes. That compares with a 1986 TAC of 266,000 tonnes.
The decision followed warnings from Canadian scientists that the northern
cod biomass, previously estimated at 1.1m tonnes, was only 780,000 tonnes.
More worryingly, Canada says, the spawning biomass was reported to have
declined by more than half.
The winter fishing of these stocks by offshore vessels inside Canada's
waters was halted and the harvesting of capelin, on which cod feed, was
banned. A scientific offensive was also launched to persuade EC member
countries that without effective management ecological catastrophe loomed.
The Grand Banks fishing grounds, which have drawn European fishermen for 400
years, extend east and south of Newfoundland, breaching Canada's 200-mile
limit at two points: the so-called nose and tail. A third rich fishing
ground, the Flemish Cap, lies further east. Groundfish such as cod and
flounder cross in and out of international waters in seasonal migrations.
Canada claims this makes them highly vulnerable to foreign fleets active
over a relatively small area of the continental shelf.
Between 90 and 140 foreign vessels, the majority from the EC, are active in
the area at any one time.
At the Earth Summit, Canada will propose a resolution calling for changes in
the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea to give coastal states
increased rights over such 'straddling' fish stocks. It hopes that the Rio
meeting will rapidly be followed by an international diplomatic conference
to work out the detail of a new high seas fisheries management order.
So far, 40 coastal states have backed the resolution, including New Zealand,
Mexico, Chile and Peru. However, no other Group of Seven industrialised
countries have done so, raising fears that the issue could prove divisive in
Rio.
In theory, a management regime already exists for the waters off Canada: the
Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Organisation, formed in 1979, of which both
Canada and the EC are signatories.
However, Mr Vic Young, president of St John's based Fishery Products
International, says: 'Nafo is totally ineffective. Any country can say it
disagrees with its Nafo quota under the organisation's objection procedure
and set its own. Nafo has declared a moratorium on northern cod outside 200
miles, but last year EC vessels caught about 40,000 tonnes.'
The EC response to its critics is scathing. Officials have denounced Canada
for making a mere 'paper' cut in its quotas, saying that Canada has simply
cut this year's northern cod TAC to the level of last year's actual catch.
They charge further that the issue is being blown out of all proportion for
domestic political reasons. Mr Manuel Marin, the EC fisheries commissioner,
said last week that he had asked for an extraordinary meeting of the Nafo
scientific council to verify the latest Canadian figures on stocks, but that
Canada had refused. Ottawa, Brussels says, is avoiding a harsh political
reality: it should restructure and cut its own fleet.
Amid the accusations and counter-accusations, many Canadians are ready to
acknowledge that the decline in the fish stocks may have complex interlinked
causes.
Mr Young of FPI is bitterly critical of the EC fishing effort for flatfish
on the tail of the Grand Banks, accusing Spanish vessels of using
ever-smaller gauge nets to harvest young fish.
However, he sees foreign overfishing as only one of the causes for the
decline in northern cod stocks. Environmental factors such as changes in the
cold water Labrador current around Newfoundland, possibly as a result of
global warming, may partially account for the decline. The fall in capelin
stocks and expansion of the seal herds are other possible factors. Seals eat
cod in the absence of capelin, their preferred food.
Some inshore fishermen, who operate with small vessels mainly within 12
miles of the shore, lay the blame for falling stocks on high-technology
offshore fishing in general, combined with government mismanagement.
'Canadian quotas were set too high for years,' said Mr Tom Best, head of the
fishing co-operative at Petty Harbour, a tiny fishing village south of St
John's on the Avalon peninsula.
'As a result, Canadian offshore boats raped the resource from the early
1980s. We must take control of the nose and tail of the Grand Banks but we
need to knock out the Canadian offshore effort as well and give the stocks a
chance to recover.'
Wherever responsibility lies, the human effects of the crisis in the
industry are real enough. 'Plant closures devastate local communities,' says
Mr Randolph Gherson, Canada's Ambassador for fisheries conservation. 'We've
had 5,000 job losses and 38 plant closures in Newfoundland since 1989.'
Some 40,000 people in the province are directly employed in the industry,
and a further 70,000-80,000 indirectly, out of a total population of about
500,000. Unemployment is running at more than 20 per cent.
Against this grim economic background, and with its own offshore fleet tied
up at the quays, it is little wonder that Canada should turn its fire on the
EC.
If no agreement is reached in Rio, Mr Crosbie warns, Canada may have no
option but to heed the siren voices calling for unilateral action, such as a
de facto extension of its territorial waters.

LONDON Metal Exchange
ALUMINIUM prices moved to the highest levels for nine months in after hours
trading, although dealers could point to no clear fundamental influences.
They attributed the rise, which took the three months position to Dollars
1,350.50 a tonne, up Dollars 27, at the end of the 'kerb' session, chiefly
to speculative and options-related activity. Early selling had been halted
after news that LME warehouse stocks had risen less than expected. COPPER
prices surrendered early gains, with the cash position ending the kerb at
Pounds 1,309.25 a tonne, down Pounds 3.25. Traders noted, however, that it
had held above support at Dollars 2,250 a tonne. At the London Futures and
Options Exchange COFFEE market sentiment was improved by news that the
International Coffee Organisation working group had reported a consensus in
favour of a price stabilisation pact with universal quotas and that its
report had been approved by the ICO council. In the absence of early news
from the ICO's 5-day meeting in London the July futures price had slipped
Dollars 13 to Dollars 870 a tonne. But it closed only Dollars 1 down on the
day at Dollars 882.

for New Zealand goods
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   WELLINGTON, MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE COMMONWEALTH of Independent States yesterday paid NZDollars 10m (Pounds
3.1m) of its outstanding debts from an estimated Dollars NZ600m which it
owes New Zealand for dairy, wool and related products that were sent to the
then Soviet Union up to 15 months ago.
Currency difficulties, which made it impossible for the CIS to settle these
debts, have led to commercial strains between the two countries, and a
virtual cessation of trade.
The Soviet Union was formerly one of New Zealand's major customers for wool,
sheepmeats and dairy products. Yesterday the retiring CIS ambassador to
Wellington, Mr Yuri Sokolov, said that the payment was a breakthrough and a
sign of good faith.
The money had been owed to the New Zealand Dairy Board, which 12 months ago
arranged credit of NZDollars 200m for staggered shipments of 100,000 tonnes
of butter and 8,000 tonnes of whole milk powder.
Mr Sokolov said the initial payment came one day after a group of leading
industrial nations agreed to give the CIS a line of credit worth NZDollars
44bn.
The former Soviet Union also owes substantial sums for wool shipped between
February and July last year. That was arranged under a credit facility
arranged between the ANZ Bank and wool merchants. Sovenz, the trading arm of
the New Zealand Dairy Board, is also owed money.
Russia plans to import 4m tonnes of refined sugar in 1992, 'to prevent a
crisis' and maintain per capita consumption at 40 to 45 kg a year, according
to a government document released at the Congress of Peoples' Deputies,
reports Reuter from Moscow. The document said 1992 output of refined sugar
from beet was expected to be 2.5m tonnes.

FT  08 APR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Inco production cuts send
nickel prices higher
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE NICKEL market was sparked to life yesterday, first by rumours of a
strike at Norilsk in Russia, the world's biggest producer, and later when
Inco of Canada, the second-largest, said that it would cut output this year
by about 10m lb (4,500 tonnes).
Inco said that its highest-cost mine would temporarily close and holidays at
its Ontario division mines would be extended.
Analysts suggested Inco hoped to stop the nickel price falling.
Nevertheless, at the close last night the London Metal Exchange price of
nickel for delivery in three months was up Dollars 57.50 a tonne at Dollars
7,530.
Earlier, the price had been buoyed by the Norilsk strike rumours. These
helped push three-month nickel to Dollars 7,535 at one stage. However,
Reuter last night reported Russian sources as saying there were no labour
problems at Norilsk.
Inco said it would suspend production at its Shebandowan mine near Thunder
Bay, Ontario, for three months. About 350 contract employees are affected.
Inco will also extend from four to five weeks the planned summer holiday
shutdown at Ontario division mines.
Analysts suggest the 10m lb production cut represents about two per cent of
Inco's previously scheduled 1992 output.
Mr William Adams, analyst at Rudolf Wolff, part of the Noranda group, said:
'This won't push the market higher on a sustained basis, but it will help to
stop the price moving below Dollars 7,200 (a tonne)'.
Mr Angus MacMillan, analyst at Billiton-Enthoven Metals, a Royal Dutch/Shell
subsidiary, also suggested the cut would have little impact on nickel prices
given the level of LME stocks (down 66 tonnes yesterday to 26,202 tonnes)
and the market's expectation of more Russian nickel exports. He said another
Russian boat carrying 11,000 tonnes of nickel left for Rotterdam yesterday
'and, when it has been cut, most of it will make its way on to the LME'.
Refined nickel production in the western world reached 600,000 tonnes last
year and the Metals &amp; Minerals Research Services consultancy organisation
estimates that this year output will be between 575,000 and 585,000 tonnes.
It suggests shipments from Cuba and Russia will far outweigh imports by
China, so western producers must trim output to halt further price falls,
'particularly as marginal producers are uncomfortable with prices much below
Dollars 4 a lb (Dollars 8,816 a tonne)'.

smelter alternatives continues
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
COMINCO has taken another step towards abandoning the German QSL technology
used for its troubled lead smelter at Trail, British Columbia.
The Vancouver-based company says in its latest annual report that it has
retained Snamprogetti of Italy to prepare 'preliminary engineering and cost
estimates' for converting the facility to the Kivcet process used by
smelters in Russia and Italy. Cominco sent a shipment to a Kivcet pilot
plant in Russia last October as part of its evaluation of alternatives to
the QSL process.
The CDollars 135m Trail smelter, with a design capacity of 160,000 tonnes a
year, has been idle since March 1990, when it was shut down three months
after being commissioned. Cominco and Lurgi, the German engineering group
which designed the QSL process, have spent the past two years working to
improve the smelter's performance. Lurgi is hoping to use similar technology
in lead smelters in several other countries. The main problem at Trail has
been in the reduction chamber of the 40-metre long reactor, where natural
gas has replaced pulverised coal as the reducing agent.
Lead operations have continued, using the old, high-cost smelter that the
QSL facility was designed to replace. Production totalled about 87,000
tonnes last year.
Three sets of tests were conducted last year on a smaller QSL smelter at
Stolberg, Germany. Cominco disclosed that while these tests showed that gas
was as effective a reducing agent as coal, the smelter 'was unable to
achieve stable commercial operations at acceptable cost levels'.
A Cominco representative said the tests at Stolberg were continuing. The
company may delay a decision on the the Trail smelter, which was expected by
the end of June 1992. Cominco said that Lurgi, which is a subsidiary of the
German metals group Metallgesellschaft, is contractually required to make
and pay for any modifications to the Trail facility required to meet
performance guarantees. It added that, given the uncertainty on the
smelter's future, it could not yet determine the size of the write-down, if
any, which may be required.

THE EUROPEAN Parliament yesterday cleared the way for reform of the European
Community's farm policy by approving a plan for the cereals sector,
parliamentary officials said, Reuter reports from Strasbourg.
Members of Parliament asked the European Commission to tone down its
proposal. Mr Ray MacSharry, the European Farm Commissioner, has proposed a
35 per cent cut in cereals prices during three years, with full compensation
conditional on land being set aside. The parliament agreed by a large
majority to ask the commission to cut prices by only 20 per cent in the
first year of reforms and rejected further cuts.
It also asked for higher compensation than the commission has proposed,
arguing that large-scale farmers would otherwise be disadvantaged. Mr
MacSharry had proposed limits on the area of land eligible for set-aside
compensation.
The vote on cereals completes the parliament's work on the farm reform
package. It gave its opinion on all other aspects of it at last month's
meeting.
The European Parliament is required to give an opinion on any planned
legislation before the Council of Ministers can finally pass it. The
commission has to consider parliament's amendments, but is not obliged to
accept them.

FT  08 APR 92 / International Equity Issues: Investors more choosy about
buying US shares
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INVESTORS are getting increasingly choosy about buying US shares, if the
results of some recent issues which had an international element are a guide
 -a sure sign that the mass of US equity issuance that accompanied the stock
market rally at the turn of the year is running out of momentum.
Earlier this week, a planned sale by Phillips Petroleum, the US energy
company, of shares in a gas subsidiary, GPM Gas, failed to get off the
ground. That followed similar failures within the past month to launch share
issues for Gulfstream Aerospace, Regency Health and Uniroyal.
The lack of support for issues has revealed that investors are no longer
prepared to take everything thrown at them from across the Atlantic.
'It's become a much tougher market,' one syndicate manager in New York
commented yesterday.
'Investors are questioning whether or not the recovery is taking place. And
with the sheer volume of deals there are, it is almost humanly impossible to
assess them all.'
The failure to find support for new issues of shares manifests itself in
different ways. Some proposed issues are postponed from week to week,
looking for the right moment to be launched. Others have emerged at prices
well below those initially indicated.
In spite of this, there are still some large US transactions emerging
internationally. Earlier this week, for example, shares in Waste Management,
the US waste disposal company, were priced, with about 26m shares placed in
the UK (worth more than Dollars 260m).
Next week, a Black &amp; Decker roadshow arrives in London to promote a
near-Dollars 500m offering, Dollars 100m of it targeted at international
investors.

CHINA'S Shenzhen Stock Exchange plans to offer foreign brokers seats so they
can directly trade 'B' shares reserved for foreigners, according to the
Beijing-controlled China News Service, Reuter reports from Hong Kong.
It also quoted sources in Shenzhen, a special economic zone bordering Hong
Kong, as saying listings for Shenzhen shares would also be sought on the
Hong Kong and Singapore stock markets.
'The Shenzhen Stock Exchange plans to offer seats to some foreign brokers so
that they could trade 'B' shares directly,' it said.
Although most demand for 'B' shares comes from Hong Kong, brokers in the
British colony must deal through counterparts in Shenzhen. Although the news
service did not say when action would be taken, it said the aim was to
expand foreign business on the market. 'B' share trading started in Shenzhen
on February 28 and four stocks are listed for foreigners.
'Shenzhen would select some qualified companies to issue stocks in Hong Kong
and Singapore and to list them there,' China News Service said.
The Hong Kong Stock Exchange is studying the listing of China stocks.
Analysts say, however, that problems must be solved first.
Accounting standards remain a key problem. The lack of a securities law in
China governing how to resolve disputes is another hurdle.

HEWLETT-Packard (HP), the US electronics and computer group, and Oki
Electric Industry, the Japanese manufacturer of communications equipment,
have signed a broad 'master' agreement to co-operate long-term in
development and marketing telecommunications systems, Reuter reports from
Tokyo.
They have not yet worked out details but will co-operate in licensing and
joint development of technology as well as customer services and marketing,
the companies said.
'We will sign many individual agreements under the umbrella of the master
agreement,' said Mr Masao Nogami, an Oki vice-president.
HP's strengths in Unix-based computer systems would complement Oki's in
systems integration, said Mr Willem Roelandts, a HP vice-president.
Mr Nogami declined to estimate the likely size of the business that would
result from the agreement.
HP and Oki have since 1990 worked together on printed circuit boards, and
since 1991 on semiconductors and private telephone exchanges.
Hewlett-Packard said Hughes Aircraft, a unit of GM Hughes Electronics, will
buy up to Dollars 100m-worth of HP's PA-Risc-based workstations and servers,
Reuter reports from Palo Alto.
HP will supply up to 4,300 HP Apollo 9000 Series 700 systems to Hughes Data

Hughes will make the systems more rugged for installation in US Navy ships,
submarines and land-based facilities under a defence contract.

marketing accord

<TEXT>
KOMATSU, the world's second largest construction equipment group, will
shortly begin marketing Krupp mobile cranes in Japan. The marketing deal has
significant long-term potential for the German steel and engineering group.
The agreement follows a commitment by the Japanese company to help European
producers expand in Japan, where they have found it difficult to establish a
foothold.
For Komatsu, the deal will emphasise that its links with Europe are not a
'one-way business,' according to Mr Frithjof Timm, president and managing
director of Komatsu Europe.
Until January 1, Mr Timm was the head of Krupp Industrietechnik's crane
division in Wilhelmshaven, northern Germany. There, he spent 18 months
negotiating the deal with Komatsu.
Krupp has designed a special model in line with the higher axle loads
required for larger cranes in Japan. The prototype is in Japan now for
specification approval and Krupp hopes to deliver 20 more this year.
The deal is Krupp's second attempt to break into the Japanese crane market.
An earlier agreement with Tadano of Japan was dissolved in the mid-1980s.
Krupp will also sell in Japan, through Komatsu, its existing all-terrain
cranes with lifting capacity above 100 tons. Komatsu's range does not extend
beyond 25 tons.
Krupp, along with the two German producers, Liebherr and Mannesmann Demag,
dominates the world market for all-terrain mobile cranes. Liebherr has a
dealer in Japan, while Demag has its own sales team.
Komatsu, meanwhile. says it will use this week's Bauma construction
equipment exhibition in Munich to establish contact with more potential
European component sources.

Innovative is not a word that readily springs to mind when it comes to Swiss
banks. In the past year, however, the big Swiss banks, led in this case by
Swiss Bank Corporation (SBC), have successfully developed derivative-based
savings instruments for smaller investors.
The idea is to give the individual saver a guaranteed return on his or her
money, as well as the opportunity for a little flutter. Put the other way
round, the instruments offer a chance to take a bet on a capital market
without risking capital.
It is something sophisticated institutional investors have been doing for
some time, but the individual saver does not have access to the money
markets or the complicated calculations that make such risk-managed products
work.
In January, 1991, SBC offered three, one-year term investment instruments
with these characteristics. The bank called them guaranteed return on
investment (Groi) securities, and sold them in units of only SFr5,000.
The investor could choose among three combinations of security and risk,
with the risk element being the movement of the SMI index of leading shares
on the Swiss stock market over the one-year term of the fund.
The investor could, for example, choose to have a guaranteed 7 per cent
return on the investment, in which case the maximum bonus - if the SMI
performed well - would be only 2.03 per cent. If, however, he chose a 0 per
cent guaranteed return, the investor could make as much as 24.72 per cent if
the SMI did well. There was also a middle option of 4 per cent guaranteed
return, where the potential bonus could take the total return up to 16 per
cent.
The units were so popular among Swiss investors, that the SBC had to cut off
applications after taking in orders worth SFr150m.
In the event, the SMI index's rise in the year to January exceeded the
targets set under the terms of the Groi, so investors in all three versions
did very well. And it is a fair bet that SBC, capitalising on the skills of
its Chicago derivatives specialist partners, O'Connor Partners, also did
well with the funds it raised.
SBC's success did not go unnoticed by other banks in Switzerland, and they
soon piled in with similar instruments, often with whimsical names. Union
Bank of Switzerland (UBS) offered the Iglu, the index growth-linked unit,
and the Clou, the currency-linked outperformance unit, while Bank Vontobel
had the Kiss, the guaranteed capital index investment unit, and Swiss
Volksbank offered a Smile, the SMI linked issue. Credit Suisse was more
prosaic, with something called the SMI deposit.
SBC has gone on to launch 60 more risk-managed instruments for individuals
and small institutions, using various other capital market indices, and even
individual shares, for the flutter element, raising a total of SFr1.2bn last
year. That is probably about half the total raised by all banks through
these instruments in the Swiss market last year.
The instruments tend to have a life of from nine months to two years, and a
secondary market has developed.
One Groi using the Nikkei index on the Tokyo stock market proved to be an
object lesson on the merits of these securities. Over the period of the
instrument, the Nikkei index tumbled 21 per cent. Investors in the Nikkei
Groi obviously got no bonus, but at least they got their capital back.
'If they had just been in Japanese equities, they would have lost a lot of
money,' Mr Mario Hafner, executive director of SBC, says. 'This experience
was the breakthrough for us in the Swiss market.'
For all the initial success, there is considerable debate about how the
market for these products is going to develop, both in Switzerland and
elsewhere.
It is remarkable that, so far, the idea has not caught on in a big way in
other countries, except for France.
In Switzerland, a couple of special factors have contributed to the appeal.
For one thing, they arrived on the market just as the commissions on small
transactions in shares rocketed following the elimination of fixed rates.
Thus, investors were attracted to securities that had carried only a modest
fee.
Some bankers had been concerned that customers would shift money from their
bank savings accounts to these securities. However Mr Renaud Planta, a
vice-president of UBS, says most of the shifting was from equities.
Second, many of Switzerland's fund managers have not been allowed to invest
in pure derivative instruments until recently, and others have been
frightened of them. The Grois and Clous provided an indirect and low-risk
way to learn new risk management techniques.
'We thought these would be retail products initially. We were astonished
that a lot of institutions bought the 4 per cent tranche of the first Groi,'
Mr Hafner says. It just so happens that 4 per cent is the minimum return
that pension funds must achieve under Swiss law.
In other countries, institutional investors already design their own
risk-management products, and Swiss bankers expect and hope this trend will
gradually take hold in Switzerland as well.
Credit Suisse has already decided to concentrate on tailor-made products,
suspecting that the market for off-the-shelf products will not continue
growing strongly or be that profitable. UBS and SBC, on the other hand,
believe a substantial market for off-the-shelf products will remain, and
will carry on issuing them.

Terminal 3

THE CHARLES Bronfman family of Montreal, through privately held Claridge
Group, is taking 73 per cent control of the CDollars 520m (USDollars 436.9m)
Terminal 3 and hotel at Toronto's Pearson International Airport.
For the past two years the 73 per cent interest had been held jointly by
Claridge and property developer Huang &amp; Danczkay Properties.
The terminal was built by H &amp; D in the late 1980s and then was put into a
joint venture with Claridge.
The 27 per cent minority holding will remain in the hands of Lockheed Air
Terminals, an affiliate of Lockheed of the US.
Terminal 3 came into operation in February 1991 just as the North American
recession was peaking. H &amp; D said that it broke even for the year, even
though the retail sections were only 50 per cent leased.
It denied that the deal with the holding company of Mr Charles Bronfman,
co-chairman of Seagram, the international drinks company, is linked with
Terminal 3's financial squeeze.
Claridge says it may bid to lease and renovate Terminals 1 and 2 in Toronto,
which are owned by the federal government.
'We are taking a strong look at bidding,' said Mr Norman Spencer, Claridge
vice-president, finance. 'It's logical now we control Terminal 3.'
Lockheed plans to retain its 27 per cent interest, but H &amp; D made clear it
wants to pursue other projects.
It is bidding with Lockheed Terminals to build a new international terminal
at Athens airport. It has already been shortlisted by the Greek government.
The project will cost between USDollars 2bn and USDollars 3bn.

NORTHROP, the US military aircraft maker, may join with Carlyle Group in
bidding for LTV's aircraft division, Reuter reports from New York.
LTV, the US steel and defence company, has been under bankruptcy protection
for the past five years.
Carlyle, an investment firm run by Mr Frank Carlucci, the former US
secretary of defence, is part of one of two bidding groups for the LTV
aircraft and missile business. Its bidding partner is Thomson-CSF, the
French state-controlled defence company.
Northrop was unavailable to comment on the possible bid for the aircraft
division. A source said Northrop would not be a 50-50 partner in the
division but that it would have a role in running the business if the
Thomson-Carlyle bid succeeds.
As part of the joint offer, Thomson is offering Dollars 280m cash for the
LTV missile business. Carlyle has offered Dollars 90m cash plus Dollars 30m
in securities for the aircraft business.
Northrop is believed to be considering a way to help enhance the securities
portion of the offer.
The Thomson-Carlyle bid rivals a Dollars 355m offer by Vought, a joint
venture formed by the US defence groups Martin Marietta and Lockheed.

</HEADLINE>

   ADVANCED Micro Devices
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
the US semiconductor manufacturer which has been locked in battle with its
principal competitor, Intel, over rights to a best-selling chip design - has
returned dramatically higher first-quarter earnings.
The company's earnings rose to Dollars 84.9m, or 86 cents a share on a fully
diluted basis, compared with Dollars 4.2m, or 2 cents, for the same period
last year. Revenues advanced to Dollars 407.4m for the quarter, a 48.5 per
cent increase over the Dollars 274.3m recorded last year.
The results far exceeded market expectations, with the average of analysts'
predictions coming out at 69 cents a share.
Mr Jerry Sanders, AMD's chairman, said the company was now the world's
second-largest microprocessor maker, behind Intel, but ahead of Motorola and
National Semiconductor.
The company attributes the revival in its fortunes to its victory earlier
this year in a five-year court battle with Intel. AMD had been fighting for
the right to manufacture its version of an Intel microprocessor chip - the
80/386  - which is now used by the majority of personal computer
manufacturers world-wide.
Intel recorded record revenues and earnings earlier this year as a result of
buoyant sales of its 80/386 and 80/486 microprocessors.
AMD won not only the right to make its version of the 80/386 chip but also
Dollars 15.3m in damages against Intel which, the trial judge said, had
breached a 1982 technology sharing pact with AMD under which the companies
had agreed to swap microprocessor and other product designs.
It is conventional in the semiconductor industry for a company with a
successful product to license its manufacture to competitors with a view to
dispersing the technology more widely and providing customers with a second
source.
However, Intel - mindful that research, development and other expenses were
costing it between Dollars 1bn and Dollars 2bn a year - refused to license
its most profitable product.
During the first quarter, AMD said, sales of its Am386 device had exceeded
Dollars 180m, more than 44 per cent of total revenues.
The company said that it had detected some improvement in the state of the
computer business - the semiconductor industry's largest customer - with
orders for some components currently exceeding shipments.

FT  08 APR 92 / International Company News: NYSE firms post record profits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WALL Street's booming trading conditions have been underlined by the 1991
results of securities companies belonging to the New York Stock Exchange.
The firms reported record after-tax profits of Dollars 3.86bn for the year,
compared with a loss of Dollars 106m in 1990. The previous record of Dollars
3.62bn was set in 1986.
The record was achieved thanks to sharp rises in equity and bond markets,
together with extremely heavy issuance of new stocks and fixed income
securities, which are underwritten by Wall Street firms.
This year has also started well, with Wall Street reaping record
underwriting fees in the first quarter - some Dollars 1.73bn, compared with
the record Dollars 1.6bn set in the fourth quarter of last year.
However, observers question whether this hectic pace can be kept up over the
course of the year.
In the fourth quarter of last year the stock exchange firms made after-tax
profits of Dollars 1.20bn, compared with a Dollars 128m loss a year earlier.
In the third quarter of 1991 they reported profits of Dollars 842m.
The figures do not include specialists who make markets in stocks on the
floor of the exchange, but do not deal with the public.
Revenues in 1991 totalled a record Dollars 61.31bn, up 13.4 per cent from
Dollars 54.05bn in 1990.
The previous peak was Dollars 59.54bn in 1989.
Fourth-quarter revenues were Dollars 15.35bn, up 15 per cent from a year
earlier.
Revenues totalled Dollars 15.25bn in the third quarter.
The full-year profits represented a 10.2 per cent annual return on the
average net worth of Dollars 37.82bn.
NYSE said member firms' expenses for 1991 had been Dollars 55.46bn, up 2.3
per cent from Dollars 54.19bn in 1990 and the second highest on record. The
highest was Dollars 57.69bn in 1989.
Expenses for the fourth quarter of 1991 increased 0.4 per cent to Dollars
13.53bn from Dollars 13.47bn in the same quarter in 1990.

FT  08 APR 92 / International Company News: Owens-Corning seeks to expand in
Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OWENS-Corning Fiberglas, the US construction products and industrial
materials group, is seeking to expand in Europe.
Mr Glen Hiner, the company's new chairman and chief executive, said in
London that the expansion programme could involve acquisitions, because that
would be enable the company to increase capacity more quickly than by
building new manufacturing plants.
Owens-Corning, the world's largest manufacturer of fibre glass materials,
has eight European plants. However, it has a much stronger presence in
industrial materials - such as reinforcements, yarns and resins - than in
construction products  - such as insulation materials and roofing.
Mr Hinder said that, with the company's worldwide position and technology,
it ought to be bigger in the European market for insulation materials. Its
one plant in Belgium was currently operating at 110 per cent of its design
capacity.
With the depressed conditions in the European market, this may be a good
time to buy, he said. 'We want to be one of the consolidators, not
consolidated.'
In the long term, he said eastern Europe and south-east Asia offered the
company its greatest potential for expansion. He did not foresee
acquisitions in the US.
Mr Hiner was speaking on his first tour of Owens-Corning's European plants
since joining the company in January, after 35 years at General Electric of
the US.
Overall, Mr Hiner wants to improve global integration of Owens-Corning's
production facilities to ensure product uniformity. 'This is a necessity
because of the growth of global customers who expect the product to be the
same in the US and Europe.'
Mr Hiner has already received plaudits from Wall Street for acting quickly
to end the uncertainty at Owens-Corning caused by asbestos-related
liabilities. Two weeks after joining the company, he announced a special
Dollars 800m non-cash charge which is expected to cover the company for
claims up to the end of the decade related to asbestos pipe insulation sold
until 1972.
Owens-Corning had previously taken a more gradual approach to making
provisions for the claims, which are now declining but still exceeded 20,000
last year.
Mr Hiner said he was 'highly confident' that the charge, based on 16
different variables, would cover claims until the year 2,000.

   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE dismal response to a rights issue by Bramalea, a large but heavily
indebted North American property developer, has underlined the severe loss
of confidence in the Canadian and US real estate industry.
Toronto-based Bramalea said that it had raised CDollars 76.4m (USDollars
64.7m) from the rights issue, compared with target financing of CDollars
115m. All but 120,000 of the 19.1m common shares issued were taken up
Bramalea's parent, Trizec Corp of Calgary. As a result, Trizec has raised
its stake in Bramalea from 66 per cent to 72 per cent.
Mr Frank Graham, Bramalea's chief financial officer, said yesterday that
'everyone is basically nervous' about real estate investments. He blamed the
poor public response partly on the troubles of Olympia &amp; York, the
cash-strapped developer which is restructuring its debts.
O&amp;Y has a 35 per cent stake in Trizec, which is North America's biggest
publicly traded developer. Trizec's share price dipped by 37 cents on the
Toronto Stock Exchange yesterday morning to CDollars 6.63, its lowest level
in two decades.
Bramalea's operations, which range from office buildings and hotels to
house-building, are concentrated in the Canadian province of Ontario and in
California. Both these regions have been hit hard by the recession.
The company suffered a CDollars 4.5m loss in the three months to January 31,
and has long-term debt of about CDollars 4.8bn.
It aims to reduce its debt by about CDollars 1bn over the next few years
through disposal of properties, and is hoping for improved cash flows in
1993 and 1994 as economic recovery takes hold.

<TEXT>
HAFSLUND Nycomed, the Norwegian pharmaceuticals and shipping group,
yesterday finalised its acquisition of Hydro Pharma, the drugs company, for
NKr127.6m (Dollars 20.28m).
Hydro Pharma, which has a turnover of about NKr180m, is one of the largest
suppliers of pharmaceuticals to the Norwegian market. The company has about
200 employees. Following the acquisition of Hydro, Hafslund Nycomed's
pharmaceuticals subsidiary, Nycomed Pharma, will become the largest drugs
group in Norway.
The move is part of Hafslund Nycomed's drive to become a pure healthcare
group and strengthen its non-imaging pharmaceutical portfolio which is
considered weak. Earlier this year Hafslund said it would spin off its
shipping interests, probably in June.
Hydro Pharma specialises in rheumatic remedies, pain relief, skin care
products and over the counter, non-prescription medicines.
Hafslund Nycomed's expertise is in non-steroid anti-inflammatory agents and
cardiovascular drugs. It is also developing a proton pump inhibitor, as well
as anti-hypertensive and anti-thrombotic medicines. However, most of these
products are still in the development stage.
The acquisition should also strengthen Hafslund Nycomed's pharmaceutical
marketing network in Scandinavia. The company has announced its intention to
market its own products rather than licence them to third parties.

two months

<TEXT>
COMMERZBANK, Germany's third biggest bank after Deutsche Bank and Dresdner
Bank, yesterday said that its total operating profits for the first two
months of the current year rose by 75 per cent.
Group profits excluding trading results - the so-called partial operating
profits - rose by 45 per cent in January and February, Mr Martin
Kohlhaussen, chief executive, said.
For the whole of last year operating profits climbed 33.5 per cent to
DM1.83bn (Dollars 1.10bn), the bank announced yesterday. Mr Kohlhaussen
acknowledged the rate of growth in January and February in part reflected a
relatively poor start to 1991. But compared with two-twelfths of last year's
total profits, operating profits still rose by 25 per cent and partial
operating profits by 14 per cent, he explained.
These figures suggest that there has been little slowdown in the demand for
credit which buoyed the profits of all the leading banks last year.
Commerzbank said partial operating profits climbed 29.8 per cent to DM1.8bn
in 1991. Total business volume rose by 5.1 per cent to DM229bn while
interest income rose 22.3 per cent to DM4.20bn. The dividend will remain
unchanged at DM10 per share.
Commerzbank's profits grew faster last year than those at its two bigger
competitors: on Monday Dresdner Bank reported operating profits up 23 per
cent to DM2.5bn, while on Thursday last week Deutsche - hit by high costs
and provisioning in the final quarter of the year - announced an increase of
16.5 per cent to DM5.97bn.
Despite the high profitability, Commerzbank has the weakest balance sheet
ratios of the three and will be obliged to hold a rights issue later this
year or early next year. Mr Kohlhaussen confirmed that the bank would be
making an equity issue but said he would not give any more details until the
bank's autumn press conference.
The bank last held an equity issue in 1986 when the shares were offered at
DM300, higher than the price which was around DM260 per share yesterday.
Analysts say it is likely that the bank will wait for its shares to rise
above this level before launching at the very minimum a 1-for-10 issue.
After the meeting Mr Ulrich Ramm, the bank's chief economist, said that a
separate issue of profit-participating certificates was likely this summer.
He added that the lively start to the present year was not simply due to an
upturn in the bank' own account trading. Without giving details, he said
that the bank had also benefited from an improvement in interest income,
better interest margins and a lower rate of provisions, as well as better
market conditions in the early part of the year.
Mr Kohlhaussen disclosed that the bank has taken its stake in DBV
Versicherungen, one of Germany's top ten life insurance companies, to 48.3
per cent from just over 25 per cent. This was in order to support the life
company's shares which have sunk below the level at which they were sold
when Commerzbank brought the company to the stock-market in 1990. Mr
Kohlhaussen said it planned to reduce its stake - acquired at the cost of
several hundred million D-Mark - when possible.

TOPDANMARK, the Danish insurer, made a DKr273m (Dollars 43.4m) loss in 1991
compared with a 1990 profit of just DKr8m. An unchanged DKr10 per share
dividend is proposed.
Steps have been taken to improve performance, said the preliminary
statement, which forecast a profit of not less than DKr200m in 1992, rising
to DKr300m to DKr400m in 1993. The 1991 result consisted of a loss of
DKr347m on primary operations and a gain of DKr74m from the adjustment for
the value of securities.
The poor result was blamed on non-recurring events, including heavy loan
loss provisions at Aktivbanken, the banking subsidiary, and DKr200m
restructuring costs.

FT  08 APR 92 / International Company News: Hong Kong group buys Charles
Jourdan - The changes taking place in the French footwear industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CHARLES Jourdan, one of the best known names among France's classic shoe
makers, has fallen victim to the downturn in the luxury goods industry by
being taken over by Dickson Concepts, a Hong Kong retailing group.
The deal comes at a time of far-reaching changes for the French footwear
companies which, in common with other areas of the global luxury goods
market, are experiencing intense financial pressure.
Earlier this year Stephane Kelian, one of Jourdan's chief competitors in
France, was forced to seek a fresh injection of capital to restructure its
finances.
Dickson Concepts has agreed to acquire Jourdan for FFr158m (Dollars 28.21m)
by buying an initial 20 per cent stake for FFr40m with an agreement to
purchase the remaining shares between 1993 and 1994.
The market for luxury shoes enjoyed rapid growth in the 1980s thanks to
strong demand from Europe, North America and the new market of Japan.
The French companies, based around the traditional shoe-making town of
Romans in the Rhone valley, benefited from the buoyant climate.
Even in the bullish era of the 1980s they came under fierce pressure from
the Italian shoe industry. In the past year or so this pressure has
intensified as tastes have swung back to classic styles, and old-established
Italian companies, such as Gucci and Ferragamo, have staged a renaissance.
These problems have been aggravated by the slowdown in the global luxury
goods market reflecting the economic problems of the US and, more recently,
of Japan.
Charles Jourdan has attempted to cut costs by transferring production from
the Rhone valley to lower-cost plants in Spain and by shedding staff. Its
manufacturing workforce in France has fallen from 2,100 in 1986 to 650. But
the group has been plagued by intermittent financial problems. It made a net
loss of Dollars 4.6m in 1991, although this represented a reduction on its
Dollars 9.5m loss from 1990.
Earlier this year Jourdan was forced into short-time working, while
management sought a longer-term solution to its financial difficulties.
Meanwhile Stephane Kelian has found a French solution to its problems in the
form of Andre, one of France's largest footwear groups, which has taken a
stake in the company following a FFr46.6m recapitalisation package on the
Lyon stock market.

ELSEVIER, the acquisitive Dutch publisher, aims to derive 45 per cent of its

important science publishing activities for the first time.
Science publishing and the professional, business and educational sectors
each accounted for 36 per cent of turnover in 1991.
Speaking at the presentation of the annual report, Mr Pierre Vinken,
chairman, said the emphasis on trade publishing would not be made at the
expense of science publishing - whose share of 1996 turnover will remain
roughly unchanged at 35 per cent - but at the expense of consumer
publishing.
This sector, which mainly comprises Elsevier's two Dutch daily newspapers,
will see its share of turnover fall to 20 per cent in 1996 from 28 per cent
in 1991 and 35 per cent in 1986, when it still represented the company's
single biggest activity. This decline would not be achieved by divestments
but by quicker growth in the other two areas.
Mr Vinken said Elsevier expected to spend its usual minimum of Fl 100m
(Dollars 53.7m) on acquisitions in 1992. In 1991, the company spent more
than 15 times this sum, most of it on acquiring Pergamon Press, the UK-based
scientific publisher, from the late Mr Robert Maxwell.
Mr Cornelis Alberti, Elsevier's finance director, said the company was
looking at new acquisitions but did not expect to announce one in the very
short term.
Mr Alberti, who was quoted by Reuter news agency last month as saying that
Elsevier would be interested in acquiring a leading foreign newspaper such
as the Financial Times, Wall Street Journal, Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung
or Suddeutsche Zeitung, said his remarks had been intended as an 'academic'
example of the type of quality Elsevier pursued in making its acquisitions.
He repeated that Elsevier realised these newspapers were not for sale.

A. P. MOLLER, the shipping, shipbuilding and oil and gas group, increased
annual net profits by 65 per cent to DKr1.92bn (Dollars 305m) from DKr1.16bn
and profits before tax by 36 per cent to DKr2.78bn from DKr2.04bn.
The boost to profits arose primarily from shipping, which doubled net
profits to DKr1.51bn from DKr743m and increased profits before ship
disposals and special items to DKr892m from DKr556m.
The preliminary statement, which contains more detail than in previous
years, shows an increase in net turnover in shipping to DKr20.18bn from
DKr16.82bn. Turnover in the oil and gas activities increased to DKr3.32bn
from DKr2.75bn.
Group equity capital and reserves rose to DKr16.29bn from DKr14.53bn and
total assets increased to DKr35.29bn from DKr30.20bn. Investments in the
shipping business last year totalled DKr5.3bn, while APM's share of
investments in North Sea oil and gas activities, in which it is in
partnership with Texaco and Shell in Danish Underground Consortium, was
DKr1.4bn.
An increase in the dividend in the twin parent companies which control the
group was proposed. The dividend in D/S 1912 will go up from 40 to 45 per
cent to DKr97m and in D/S Svendborg from 40 to 60 per cent to DKr89m.
Oil and gas activities, which comprise production from the Danish sector of
the North Sea, gave an increase in operating profits to DKr1.47bn from
DKr1.14bn, but net profits, after inter-group allocations and tax, were down
to DKr113m from DKr126m.
Results by the Maersk Line container fleet and the tanker fleet were better
than in 1990, said the statement, while bulk carriers and gas tankers did
slightly less well and the offshore rigs and supply vessels yielded
unchanged results.
Shipping results in 1992 are likely to be 'significantly below' 1991.

FT  08 APR 92 / International Company News: Philips to cut a third of PC
jobs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
PHILIPS, the Dutch electronics company, said yesterday that it is to cut one
third of the 1,800 jobs in its loss-making personal computer operation - the
company's last remaining computer activity  - and halt the direct sales of
PCs in the US.
The company will stop selling PCs in the US through traditional outlets and
channels and will, instead, seek to produce computers for other US
manufacturers which will then sell the equipment under their own names.
A company spokesman said that the US has borne the brunt of the malaise in
the industry, forcing Philips to rethink its US strategy as part of its
world-wide restructuring of the sector.
'The main aim of the plan is to bring the company's entire infrastructure in
the field of PCs more into line with existing market conditions and with
Philips' market position,' the company said.
Philips, which sold off its mainly European-based mini-computer division to
Digital of the US last year, said it will redouble its PC sales efforts in
Europe, Canada and the Far East.
The company, which has always been a relatively small player on the computer
market, said it will also be looking for additional opportunities to
manufacture PCs for other computer companies.
The majority of the 600 job losses will be made at Philips' PC factory in
Montreal, Canada.
Under the restructuring plans, Philips' newly opened PC assembly plant in
Tilburg, in the Netherlands, is to stop building computers and will
concentrate instead on packaging Canadian-made computers for the US market.
The Dutch plant will also be given the new task of producing software for
the European market, somewhat cushioning the job losses caused by the ending
of computer assembly.
Philips' previous plans for starting up its own production of notebook
computers in Taiwan have been frozen while the company reasseses the
prospects for this area of the market.
The undisclosed costs of the latest restructuring at Philips will be covered
by provisions already taken by the group as part of efforts to boost
profitability. The company declined to give figures for present and future
PC production, saying only that the sector continued to make losses.

FT  08 APR 92 / UK Company News: Losing the sparkle in a cold climate - How
the recession and forced restructuring has hit Whitbread
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP RAWSTORNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHITBREAD's 250th anniversary this year finds it with little cause to
celebrate.
The veteran of the UK brewing industry is suffering more than its rivals
from exposure to the chill economic climate and the rigours of the
industry's enforced restructuring.
With 92 per cent of profits generated inside the UK, even some long-time
supporters in the City are beginning to worry about its pinched and harried
look.
Will it recover its former bounce and emerge rejuvenated when the
long-promised economic recovery comes?
Its financial constitution remains sound. Until this year it had enjoyed 16
years of uninterrupted profit growth. Net debt stands at less than Pounds
400m, gearing at 16 per cent, and interest is covered 8 times.
'Over the last 18 months,' says Mr Peter Jarvis, chief executive, 'existing
businesses have been broadly cash neutral and we have borrowed to make
acquisitions.'
The troubles that beset Whitbread, Mr Jarvis insists, are peripheral: the
body of the business is healthy though there may be a touch of frostbite to
the toes.
But as the recession and the increasing competitiveness of the industry
combine to depress the outlook for beer volumes, prices, and margins over
the next two or three years, some industry observers are sceptical about the
ability of Whitbread's breweries and pubs to continue pumping out the
profits it needs to expand its other retailing operations.
Consolidation of the brewing industry has left Whitbread well behind Bass,
Courage, and Allied/Carlsberg (if that merger is approved) with a 13 per
cent share compared to the others' 19 per cent to 23 per cent. But
Whitbread's niche is stronger than its national position suggests.
Production and distribution is as cost-efficient as any of its rivals. It
was the first UK brewer to build large green field production plants and it
has further reduced costs by closing four breweries in the last three years.
Its draught beer business is tightly focused, giving it the biggest market
share in south-east England, and a strongly competitive position along the
south coast, in the west country, and the north-west. It also has strong
beer brands. Heineken and Stella Artois lagers make it market leader in the
growing take-home trade. Boddingtons heads a sizeable portfolio of
cask-conditioned ales; Murphy's stout, in only its second year of
distribution, last year achieved Pounds 75m in retail sales.
Continuing success for these brands is essential if Whitbread is to maintain
its position as the beer market becomes freer under the impact of the
government's beer orders, requiring the national brewers to release some
11,000 pubs from exclusive beer supplies.
Whitbread's announcement of charges of Pounds 37m for bad debts shows how
costly and relatively unsuccessful its attempts to extend its foothold in
free trade pubs have been. Of its 11,000-12,000 customers, about a quarter
are in financial difficulties.
The restructuring of pub retailing, initiated by the Monopolies and Mergers
Commission, has been more onerous on Whitbread than any of its competitors.
The group's pubs, with average beer sales smaller than those of their
rivals, have been more difficult to sell in the depressed property market.
About 1,000 have been sold, however, at book value; and another 300 are
expected to be sold before the November 1 deadline. The remaining 1,200 are
to be leased free of the tie and for short-term periods to regional brewers
and pub companies.
One complication remains to be sorted out. Stakes held by Whitbread and the
associate Whitbread Investment Company (WIC) in regional brewers Marston's,
Morland, and Brakspear, and in the Devenish and Boddington pub companies,
bring their pub estates into the reckoning.
If the shareholdings remain unchanged, Whitbread would have to free another
1,000 pubs. The competitive disadvantages that would bring make it certain
the stakes will be diluted. Some speculate that a solution may be found in
the abolition of Whitbread's 'poison-pill' two-tier share structure.
Whitbread has made a Pounds 87m provision for the cost of this
restructuring, which will deliver another knock to beer sales. It will be
left, however, with a tied estate of about 4,150 focus of an intensive
refurbishment programme over the past four years.
Since 1988, Pounds 60m a year has been ploughed back into improving the
1,600 managed houses; and 1,500 of the 2,500 tenanted pubs have so far been
similarly upgraded to attract the more discerning customer of the 1990s.
Pubs have been contributing more than half of Whitbread's profits, and from
them was bred the retailing management skills on which its expansion has
been largely based.
Whitbread's hotels - from the upmarket Country Club chain to the economy
Travel Inns - have continued to perform ahead of rivals in the recession-hit
market. More than Pounds 400m has been spent on improvements in the past
four years, and there seems no reason to doubt they will prosper from any
upturn in the economy.
Benefits should soon be evident,too, from some shrewd acquisitions in other
fields. With the Pounds 49.5m purchase of the Dominic off-licence chain from
GrandMet last October, Thresher is now the largest specialist drinks
retailer in the UK with a total of 1,660 stores, well placed to share in the
expected growth of the take-home drinks trade this decade.
The Pounds 115m acquisition of the Berni pub/restaurants has strengthened
its Beefeater chain; and TGI Friday's, the US-style diners, Henry's cafe
bars, and Mulligans fish restaurants, are being gradually expanded.
Pizza Hut, the UK joint venture, has consolidated its grip on the pizza
sector of the competitive fast-food market, with an overall 35 per cent
share.
Its success in the UK promised much for Whitbread's future profits in the
development of the European franchise. Mr Jarvis does not hide his regret
about the decision to withdraw from that venture after an initial Pounds 40m
investment. 'It had great potential,' he says, 'but the exit terms on offer
were just not good enough to safeguard shareholders' interests in the huge
investment needed.'
The European development would also have helped reduce Whitbread's
dependence on the UK market - the cause of much of its present troubles.
Virtually its only overseas interests are its small but successful Keg
restaurants in North America and Australia, and the Churrasco steak houses
in Germany.
'The strategy, however, remains intact,' he says. 'We intend to prove to
ourselves that we can run restaurants in these countries as well as any
other operator - and then do it on a bigger scale.'

FT  08 APR 92 / UK Company News: Cost control helps boost Sherwood 36% to
Pounds 14.5m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TIGHT CONTROL of costs and a high level of automation helped full-year
profits at Sherwood Group, the lace and sock manufacturer, rise 36 per cent,
from Pounds 10.6m to Pounds 14.5m pre-tax.
The Nottingham-based company is applying to move from the USM to the main
market from May 11.
It also announced a 4-for-1 scrip issue and the addition of a non-executive
director to the board.
These changes will 'help attract a wider shareholder base,' said Mr David
Parker, chairman and chief executive.
Turnover for 1991 rose to Pounds 118.2m (Pounds 95.8m) and earnings per
share climbed 25 per cent to 54.5p (43.5p). The total dividend is lifted to
11.4p (9.1p) via a proposed final of 7.5p.
The company was cash generative and saw gearing fall from 78 per cent to 44
per cent. 'It should be below 40 per cent by the end of 1992,' said Mr
Parker.
Sales by the company's garments operation were boosted by the acquisition
last year of sock maker Samuel Eden.
The acquisition of a second sock supplier, Charles W Hall, came too late to
affect the figures.
The division's turnover rose to Pounds 40m (Pounds 30.3m) and trading in the
first few month of this year was 'ahead of budget' and close to a 10 per
cent improvement on 1991. By contrast, lace sales this year have been
virtually flat. In 1991, they were worth Pounds 79m (Pounds 66.7m).
Margins in both lace and garments showed small improvements over the year.
The company is sharply increasing capital spending from Pounds 4.02m to
Pounds 7.65m.
The shares rose 10p to 790p.
COMMENT
Recent visitors to the company's headquarters may have wondered how it could
afford to refurbish its offices with wood panelling in the middle of a
recession. Now they know the answer. Sherwood employs as few people as
possible and lets machines do the work. The six years since flotation have
seen earnings grow 29 per cent compound each year. It will be hard to
maintain that pace, especially since lace sales are flattening after two
years of strong growth. Pre-tax profits this year should reach Pounds 19m
for a p/e of less than 13. The fickle world of fashion might yet deem lace
to be passe, but Sherwood is one of the few growth stocks in a
yield-dominated sector.

FT  08 APR 92 / UK Company News: Strong performance by publishing boosts
Boosey
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STRAINS OF Stravinsky, Rachmaninoff carried Boosey &amp; Hawkes, the instrument
maker and music publisher, to a 24 per cent increase in profits last year.
The pre-tax return at one of Britain's oldest music publishers rose from
Pounds 3.25m to Pounds 4m for the 1991 year on turnover 9 per cent higher at
Pounds 53.7m.
The strongest performance came from the music publishing division where
turnover rose by 13 per cent to Pounds 11.6m with operating profits jumping
31 per cent to Pounds 3.5m.
Mr Richard Holland, chief executive, said the bulk of the division's profits
growth had been derived from royalties. The group continued to seek out and
sign new talent - such as John Adams, composer of the opera Nixon in China.
He warned, however, that growth in publishing would slow this year, as the
sharp increase had followed a meagre rise in 1990.
The group closed its printing factory in north London. Mr Holland said the
benefits of contracting out the work would be felt this year. The costs of
closing the factory and shutting a loss-making Scandinavian company offset
the gain of Pounds 0.5m on yen exchange rates.
The instrument division was hit by the effects of the Gulf war and
recession. Turnover increased by 8 per cent to Pounds 42.1m while operating
profit benefited from cost cutting to rise by 13 per cent to Pounds 3.1m.
The group, 51 per cent owned by the US music publisher Carl Fischer and its
pension fund, cut gearing by 5 percentage points to 69 per cent.
Earnings were 60p (49.4p). The final dividend is raised to 14.5p for a total
of 20p (16.4p).

FT  08 APR 92 / UK Company News: Addison rights left with underwriters
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A Pounds 16.3m rights issue designed to pay for Addison Consultancy's
purchase of the main businesses of AGB Research has been left with the
underwriters.
AGB was bought in February from the administrators of the private interests
of the collapsed empire of the late Mr Robert Maxwell in a deal worth Pounds
14.75m.
Only 2.4 per cent of the issue was taken up, with main Addison shareholders
such as Lord Hollick's MAI group deciding not to take up their rights.
The issue was underwritten by Robert Fleming, the merchant bank, and was
fully sub-underwritten by a number of institutions.
Flemings were putting a brave face on the outcome yesterday and said the
financing had always been regarded and marketed as more of a placement than
a rights issue.
MAI made it clear at the time the rights issue was announced that it
intended to sell its then 24.8 per cent stake if the acquisition was
completed.
As a result of the rights issue the original Addison shareholders have had
their stakes diluted and the company now has, by design or otherwise, a raft
of institutional investors.
Flemings declined to say last night who the sub-underwriters were other than
to say that they were a group of well-known institutions.
Mr Tony Cowling, chief executive of Addison, was unavailable for comment
yesterday.
A number of former AGB executives were also able to subscribe. Acceptances
were received for a total of 3.6m new ordinary shares offered under the
rights issue.
Certificates for the new ordinary shares will be sent to shareholders by May
22.
Addison shares closed down  1/2 p at 10 1/2 p.

St Ives, the UK's largest independent printer, yesterday reported static
interim profits reflecting tough conditions in its core magazine and book
printing businesses.
The company, which prints titles like Which, Marketing Week and the Tatler,
announced unchanged pre-tax profits of Pounds 10.1m for the six months to
January 31 on turnover ahead to Pounds 109.1m (Pounds 108m).
The results exceeded expectations and the shares gained 4p to 233p.
Operating profits increased slightly to Pounds 10m (Pounds 9.8m) and would
have been higher still without Pounds 400,000 (Pounds 300,000) of redundancy
costs and Pounds 300,000 of bad debt provisions.
Earnings held steady at 7.3p. The interim dividend is maintained at 1.5p.
The re-equipment programme, which has cost Pounds 130m over the last five
years, is now largely complete.

<TEXT>
Wardle Storeys, the plastic and safety equipment group, yesterday dismissed
talk of an economic recovery in the UK as 'election fever' after announcing
a marginal rise in pre-tax profits, from Pounds 4.29m to Pounds 4.36m, for
the six months to February 29.
Mr Brian Taylor, chief executive, said: 'You have to be a fully paid up
member of a political party to believe that a recovery has taken place. Talk
of recovery is not connected with rational thought; there is no evidence of
any upturn.'
A strong performance from parachutes and life rafts enabled the group to
report its first profit increase since November 1990 on reduced sales of
Pounds 24.8m (Pounds 28.3m). Operating profits from safety and survival
equipment, tailored to special forces unconnected with the recent defence
cuts, rose to Pounds 1.83m (Pounds 1.43m).
The interim dividend is maintained at 4p.

FT  08 APR 92 / UK Company News: Next surprises City with turnround to
Pounds 12.3m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEXT, the fashion retailer, surprised the City by announcing pre-tax profits
of Pounds 12.3m for the year to end-January, compared with a loss of Pounds
40.7m and after profits of only Pounds 200,000 in the first half. The shares
rose 5p to 71p.
Next also said it planned a final dividend of 0.75p, after passing the final
dividend last year and omitting the interim for 1991-92. Lord Wolfson,
chairman, said he anticipated paying both an interim and final dividend for
the current year.
The profit increase was helped by a Pounds 1.5m pension holiday which Lord
Wolfson said would continue for the next two years at least. However, the
depreciation charge of Pounds 20.5m included a Pounds 4.5m one-off
write-down of fixtures and fittings as the group adopted more conservative
policies.
The group's results were distorted by the sale of Grattan, its mail order
side, last year. Group turnover was Pounds 462m compared with Pounds 878m
which included Pounds 401m of sales from discontinued businesses. Operating
profits were Pounds 11.1m against a year earlier operating loss of Pounds 2m
before a Pounds 9.2m profit from discontinued businesses.
Interest receivable was Pounds 1.2m (payable Pounds 14.4m) and there were no
exceptional charges (Pounds 33.5m charge).
The high street retail operation made an operating profit of Pounds 6.4m
(loss Pounds 2.3m), on sales only 3.2 per cent higher at Pounds 282m. After
a first half loss of Pounds 1m the second half made Pounds 9.1m before a
Pounds 1.7m loss (Pounds 200,000 loss) in the Next to Nothing clearance
shops.
Lord Wolfson said costs had been cut and ranges improved. The group had
managed its stock better, meaning less excess stock. As a result there had
not been enough for the group's clearance shops to sell, causing the higher
loss there, and all but six had been sold.
The Next Directory home shopping business increased operating profits from
Pounds 2.6m to Pounds 4m, on sales up from Pounds 87.5m to Pounds 88.1m. The
sales gain was less than budgeted but there were fewer markdowns here too.
Club 24, the credit card business, lost Pounds 22m but this was charged to
the Pounds 33.2m provision set up in the previous financial year. Lord
Wolfson said that Pounds 10m of the provision was left but the group did not
expect to use it all.
Tax was Pounds 900,000 (Pounds 9.3m) which represented advance corporation
tax on the proposed dividend. Lord Wolfson said the group would have a low
tax charge for the next four years.
Earnings per share were 3.08p (losses 13.58p).
The balance sheet had cash of Pounds 106.5m at the year end thanks to the
sale of Grattan, which raised Pounds 167.5m. The cash will partly be used to
redeem the eurobond in October costing Pounds 70.8m in principal with Pounds
22m of supplemental interest.
COMMENT
It is surprising just how quickly a retail group can be turned round when
management gets to grips with the problems. Once the sale of Grattan had
secured the group financially, Next could tackle its fundamental problems
and set to the task with vigour. The figures are even better than they look
given the depreciation charge. The group reckons it has done at least a
third of the work, though this is the easiest part, but the momentum is
there and staff morale is apparently high. On forecasts of Pounds 22m for
the current year, and a low tax charge, the prospective p/e is just over 13
which could come down to under 10 next year. Although the shares have done
well there is some more to go for.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
BET, the industrial services group, is refinancing Dollars 140m (Pounds 81m)
of its Dollars 500m of auction market preferred stock (Amps) by way of a
private placement by the National Westminster Bank.
Amps are securities which can only be redeemed by the issuer and which have
an interest rate set by investors bidding for the paper at auctions,
generally held every 28 days.
However, some Amps issues have been fixed for five year periods.
NatWest will issue Dollars 140m of notes in the US private placement market,
and use the proceeds to buy some of BET's Amps. Investors in the notes will
still be exposed to BET's credit risk.
The NatWest notes will have a five year term giving BET a fixed rate of
interest over that period. After that the Amps will come back into the
market.
Observers said that by taking Dollars 140m out of the Dollars 500m Amps BET
has outstanding, the rest may achieve a more favourable interest rate at
future auctions. BET's Amps have this week been downgraded by Standard &amp;
Poor's, the credit rating agency, from A to A-.

CHINA MERCHANTS, one of Beijing's biggest companies operating in Hong Kong,
yesterday agreed to pay Pounds 100m for a 15 per cent interest in Modern
Terminals (MTL), from the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company
and the Commonwealth Development Corporation.
The share of MTL will give China Merchants a stake in Hong Kong's second
largest container operator and a front seat in bidding for the construction
and operation of the colony's proposed ninth container terminal.
P&amp;O sold 8.1 per cent of its 23 per cent stake in MTL for Pounds 55m,
realising a profit of Pounds 49m on book value. CDC, a UK government
financial institution which invested Pounds 2m in 6.9 per cent of MTL in
1975, walks away with Pounds 45m.
P&amp;O will retain 14.9 per cent of MTL. The capital released from the sale
will allow it to expand in the region.
MTL's other shareholders are Wharf, which owns 25.6 per cent, and Swire,
which has 13 per cent.

FT  08 APR 92 / UK Company News: Overseas activities hold Meggitt downturn
at 2%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MEGGITT, the specialist engineering group, yesterday reported profits down
only 2 per cent as a result of resilience in its overseas markets.
The pre-tax line for the 1991 year fell from Pounds 23.9m to Pounds 23.5m on
sales down less than 1 per cent at Pounds 301.9m.
Earnings per share fell from 9.4p to 8.6p, reflecting what Mr Ken Coates,
chairman, said was 'a remarkable performance' for the industry. The company
is to pay a final dividend of 2.4p, giving a total of 3.6p - up 5.6 per cent
for the year.
The largest controls division was strongly supported by sales in Germany and
to a lesser extent in France but was hit by recession in the UK. Mr Coates
said several UK companies had seen an improvement in orders in recent
months. Profits rose 10 per cent to Pounds 7.4m.
In aerospace, where profits rose 15 per cent, the group continued to develop
civil markets and benefited only briefly from Gulf war-related spending.
The smaller electronics and energy divisions increased profits by 14 per
cent and 21 per cent respectively, although the latter reported delays in
capital spending in the second half.
Meggitt also cut Pounds 25m out of working capital during the year, reducing
gearing from 59 per cent to 26 per cent before the Pounds 39m rights issue
last September. At the year-end it had Pounds 22m cash on deposit.
Mr Coates said the group had 'taken advantage of the recession to do all the
things you need to do in a business that has grown very quickly'.
The group also provided within minority interests for a redemption premium -
the additional cost to the company should preference share holders redeem
their shares.
This was in line with a new accounting directive on convertible bonds issued
by the Urgent Issue Task Force of the Accounting Standards Board.
COMMENT
Meggitt has about it the air of a company preparing the market for a rights
issue-financed acquisition. Opportunities have not been as good for quite a
while, we are led to believe. There is, however, a case for caution and not
only because Meggitt so nearly got its fingers burned before it walked away
from its 1990 bid for USH. Operationally, the controls division will be
unable to rely so heavily on Germany or France where growth is slowing and
signs of recovery in the UK that Mr Coates refers to are still little more
than faint stirrings. Likewise aerospace, the other key division, is in for
a rough couple of years with aircraft orders falling globally. Brokers are
looking for pre-tax profits this year, including the benefits of the recent
acquisition of Endevco, the US sensors company, of Pounds 25.8m, giving a
prospective multiple of 11.

FT  08 APR 92 / UK Company News: Magnetic Materials in the red
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Magnetic Materials Group, the USM-quoted company which last year fought off
a Pounds 9.9m bid from the acquisitive TT Group, plunged into the red during
the first half as restructuring costs and recession eroded profits, writes
Peggy Hollinger.
Mr Brian Morris, who took over as chairman in July, said the group's first
interim loss was due to a sharp decline in the order book. He added,
however, that orders since January were one third higher than last year at
Pounds 4.5m.
Pre-tax losses of Pounds 1.82m, after exceptional restructuring charges of
Pounds 1.23m, compared with profits of Pounds 220,000. The result was
further depressed by interest charges of Pounds 168,000, compared with gains
of Pounds 50,000, due to the costs of fighting TT's bid. Turnover for the
six months to December 31 fell from Pounds 7.34m to Pounds 6.82m.
Losses per share were 10.1p (earnings of 0.8p). The interim dividend is
reduced to 0.6p (0.9p).

FT  08 APR 92 / UK Company News: Tesco hits Pounds 546m but slows in second
half
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HIGHER productivity, new store openings and the benefit of the Pounds 572m
rights issue a year ago helped Tesco, the food retailer, to increase pre-tax
profits by 25 per cent to Pounds 545.5m in the 53 weeks to to February 29.
Excluding property disposals, profits rose by 31 per cent to Pounds 545m
(Pounds 417.1m).
Sir Ian MacLaurin, chairman, said the recession had started to hit the
company in the second half of last year but sales were now showing marginal
volume growth on a comparable basis.
With further productivity gains as well, he expected 'yet another year of
profit growth'. Tesco's shares rose 4 1/2 p to 255 1/2 p.
Sales for the year grew by 12.9 per cent to Pounds 7.6bn including VAT, with
about 2 percentage points of the gain coming from the 53rd week of the
financial year. The first half saw sales up 12.5 per cent to Pounds 3.3bn.
The second half sales increase was 13.1 per cent to Pounds 4.3bn, but of
that 3.6 percentage points was due to the extra week's trading. However, the
sales rise in comparable stores was 6.5 per cent in the first half and 2.5
per cent in the second.
Operating profits were 19.8 per cent ahead at Pounds 503.3m, giving a margin
on sales excluding VAT of 7.1 per cent (6.6 per cent). First half operating
profits rose 24 per cent to Pounds 200.2m while the second half advance was
17 per cent to Pounds 303.1m.
The second half saw the start of Sunday opening in England and Wales in the
run up to Christmas.
Sir Ian said this had been 'an unqualified success' with 500,000 people
shopping at Tesco on Sunday.
In Scotland, where Tesco had been open on Sunday for eight years, Sunday
sales accounted for over 10 per cent of the week's business - in England and
Wales it currently represented about 5 per cent.
After capitalising interest of Pounds 88m (Pounds 63m) interest receivable
was Pounds 65.5m (Pounds 19.1m). The interest benefit from the rights money
was about Pounds 69m although it caused a 3 per cent dilution at the
earnings per share level. Mr David Reid, finance director, said capitalised
interest would fall in 1992-93 to about Pounds 78m.
The group's capital spending programme is beginning to slow. In 1990-91 the
group spent Pounds 950m, this fell to Pounds 850m last year and will drop to
Pounds 800m in the current year. Sir Ian said that land prices and building
costs were falling.
Last year 24 stores were opened and two extended adding 977,000 sq ft of
sales space, while 12 totalling 175,000 sq ft were closed taking the total
to 396 stores with net selling area of 10.5m sq ft.
The current year would see a 1.1m sq ft increase with 28 stores opening, and
20-25 stores are planned for 1993-94 adding 900,000 to 1m sq ft.
At the year end net gearing was 14.4 per cent. Mr Reid said there was still
a cash outflow from the business, which would be about Pounds 200m in the
current year, taking year end debt to about Pounds 550m.
However, the outflows would reduce and the group would be cash neutral by
1994-95 with gearing staying well under 30 per cent.
During the year Tesco raised Pounds 320m through long-term debt instruments
and Pounds 50m from the sale and leaseback of six stores.
Improved working capital control contributed Pounds 59m to group funding,
with the stock turn at the year end down to 2.5 weeks (2.8 weeks), the
lowest in the industry, Tesco claimed.
A fall to 2 weeks is expected in the next few years as benefits from
automatic reordering come through.
High wage increases last year meant the ratio of wages to sales worsened by
0.3 percentage points but Mr David Malpas, managing director, said this
would improve by 0.2 percentage points in the current year.
After a 27.5 (30.6) per cent tax rate fully diluted earnings per share rose
20.2 per cent to 19.95p, excluding the profits on property sales. A final
dividend of 4.3p (3.6p) is proposed giving a total of 6.3p (5.25p) a rise of
20 per cent.

FT  08 APR 92 / UK Company News: United Friendly rises to Pounds 20m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
United Friendly Group, the life and general insurance underwriter, made
profits of Pounds 20.1m in the 1991 year, up from Pounds 18.8m last time and
slightly ahead of market forecasts.
The company has funds of Pounds 2bn under management.
Life premium income rose by 6 per cent to Pounds 165.8m, ordinary branch
premiums overtaking industrial branch premiums for the first time. The
improvement was largely due to the success of single premium and recurring
single premium pensions sales.
Total new annual life premiums were Pounds 20.6m, while new single premiums
were Pounds 7.6m. There were also an estimated Pounds 12.7m in new recurring
single premiums on SERPS-related pensions.
Holders of with-profits life policies were allocated a record Pounds 140.8m
(Pounds 119.9m) in bonuses.
Investment income declined to Pounds 8.4m (Pounds 10.1m) as a result of
lower interest rates.
General branch premiums written totalled Pounds 71.7m (Pounds 60.8m) and the
underwriting result for the year was a slightly reduced loss of Pounds 4m
(Pounds 5m).
A final dividend of 8.1p makes a 12.3p (10.25p) total.

FT  08 APR 92 / Heron faces call on Pounds 450m bonds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HERON International's financial problems worsened yesterday when the
troubled property group's bonds were called into default by bondholders and
a lead manager of the bonds.
Once the bonds are in default, bondholders can demand immediate repayment of
principal, totalling Pounds 450m, threatening the property group's survival.
However, Heron is confident that bondholders will recognise it is not in
their interests to demand immediate repayment.
But Credit Suisse, lead manager of four Swiss franc bonds, whose face value
is SFr600m (Pounds 230.7m) said the terms proposed last Friday by Heron to
reschedule repayments on Pounds 500m of bank loans and the bonds were not
acceptable to bondholders. 'They (Heron's directors) know the current terms
are not acceptable,' said a Credit Suisse executive.
Credit Suisse is organising a meeting of the bond lead managers - the
investment banks which arranged the sale of the bonds - on Monday in Zurich.
The other lead managers are Banque Indosuez of France, Deutsche Bank of
Germany, Warburg Sogitic of Switzerland, Credit Lyonnais of France and Royal
Bank of Canada.
Although Heron sketched out plans for a financial reconstruction last week,
it may be months before bondholders receive concrete terms.
'We are endeavouring to keep bondholders up to date with what's going on,'
said a Heron spokesman. 'But we cannot make formal proposals to bondholders
until we have further discussions with our banks'.
Credit Suisse said it was forced to call its four bonds into default when
holders of other bonds called their bonds into default. 'We did not want to
put holders of our bonds at a disadvantage vis-a-vis the holders of other
bonds,' said an executive.
Under the covenants relating to most of Heron's bonds, holders have the
right to call a default if the company proposes a financial reconstruction,
which it did last week. However, under Swiss law only the lead manager of a
Swiss bond can call a default.
Heron is trying to reschedule its debts because it is convinced that it will
breach the covenants on its bank loans. One of its covenants stipulates that
its net worth must exceed Pounds 350m. However, Heron, advised by
accountants Price Waterhouse, estimates that its net assets at the end of
March were Pounds 135m, down from Pounds 585m in March 1991.

FT  08 APR 92 / Tesco and Next say sales are improving
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CONFIRMATION of an improving trend in retail sales came yesterday from
Tesco, the supermarket group, and Next, the fashion retailer. Both said when
announcing annual results that sales had been picking up. Confident trading
statements from retailers could continue as most companies in the sector
report during the next few weeks.
One retail analyst said: 'The more retailers we talk to, the more apparent
it is that there is the beginning of a mild recovery.' Government statistics
had shown a slight rise in retail sales in the first two months of the year.
Sir Ian MacLaurin, chairman of Tesco, said 'from our point of view recession
is clearly moving away now'.
Food retailers are relatively immune to recession but Sir Ian said:
'September to November last year was a bad time for us.'
Sir Ian said confidence was starting to return and 'there is clearly a
recovery'. The group started to open stores in England and Wales on Sunday
in December, which helped sales, and he said 'Christmas was very good'.
Sales volumes this year were rising marginally, whereas last year they had
been slightly down.
Next reported a turnround from losses of Pounds 40.7m before tax to a profit
of Pounds 12.3m, better than the market had expected. Lord Wolfson,
chairman, said since February 1, the group's high street shops were showing
a 7 per cent sales increase, a rate higher than inflation in clothing,
although the group had closed 5 per cent of its shop space.
Lord Wolfson said 'whilst we expect the retail environment to remain
difficult for much of the year ahead, trade is improving'.
Mr David Jones, chief executive, said he could not tell how much of this was
due to the group's own efforts to improve its product ranges and how much
was a general upturn in trade.
Laura Ashley, the fashion and furnishings retailer which reported on Monday,
said UK sales were flat in February and March against 1991. However, last
year's March figures included Easter, which lifts sales, so on a comparable
basis March this year had been better.
Both Tesco and Next said if a Labour government introduced minimum wage
legislation it would have no material effect on them.
Tesco shares rose 4 1/2 p to 255 1/2 p and Next shares were up 5p at 71p
yesterday.

FT  08 APR 92 / Japanese equities plunge to lowest for 5 1/2 years
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
JAPANESE EQUITIES plunged yesterday to their lowest levels for 5 1/2 years,
taking the Nikkei index of leading shares below the 18,000 mark.
The Nikkei fell 644.82 to 17,791.55, the lowest it has been since November
1986. Brokers and businessmen saw little prospect of a recovery, after last
week's cut in the official discount rate and government spending package had
failed to boost confidence.
'The stock market is now like a bottomless swamp,' Mr Yoshinari Yamashiro,
president of NKK, the steel company, told a press conference.
Any hope that last week's action by the authorities might restore market
confidence has been crushed by the selling of bank shares. Yesterday the
Nikkei index of bank stocks fell 6.9 per cent, compared with a 3.5 per cent
decline in the overall index.
In the past 10 days, bank shares have fallen by 20 per cent, the single
biggest element in a 12 per cent decline in the Nikkei. The market value of
Industrial Bank of Japan, the country's premier bank, has fallen by 77 per
cent from its peak of Y15,000bn at the height of the bull market in December
1989.
Nevertheless, brokers report few signs of panic. Turnover in the Tokyo Stock
Exchange's first section totalled just 200m shares yesterday, far short of a
sell-off.
Bank shares have fallen faster than most stocks in recent weeks because they
were bidded up last year by investors, principally foreign fund managers,
who saw the stocks as a way of profiting from an expected decline in
interest rates. Banks tend to benefit from falling rates because their
profit margins widen. Rates have indeed fallen but bank shares have been hit
by growing doubts about banks' capital reserves and an increasing burden of
property-related bad debt.
The decline in bank stocks should not in itself have much direct impact on
banks' commercial operations. It will inhibit equity fund-raising but this
has already been rendered almost impossible by the market's weakness.
However, by pushing down the value of the market as a whole, falling bank
shares erode the worth of the banks' share portfolios. Since a portion of
these portfolios is counted as capital under the rules of the Bank for
International Settlements, the banks' capital base is being eaten away.
Under BIS rules which come into force next year, banks must have a minimum
ratio of capital to assets of 8 per cent. Following the latest stock market
fall, leading Japanese banks are now probably below this figure, though
above 7 per cent. They can make good the difference by raising subordinated
debt, as they have been doing for much of the past two years.

FT  08 APR 92 / Italy faces uncertainty after rebuff to ruling coalition
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ITALIAN POLITICIANS turned their attention yesterday to the problems of
forming a new government after Sunday's general election left the outgoing
four-party coalition with only 47 per cent of the vote.
The election result was a sharp rebuff to Italy's long-running Christian
Democrat authority and has created an unprecedented fragmentation of
parliament.
Senior ministers readily conceded this situation had opened up grave
uncertainties about the country's governability.
'What people have called an earthquake is indeed true,' said Mr Enzo Scotti,
the Christian Democrat interior minister, commenting on the final results.
'Our country now faces institutional problems, delicate problems of
governability linked to the decisions concerning institutional reform which
will now have to be taken on board,' he said.
'The road has only just begun and we will have to pay heed to the will of
the people in finding solutions to problems which have been on the table for
years.'
Newspaper headlines yesterday proclaimed: 'in search of an impossible
government', 'the wall of the Christian Democrats has fallen', 'nomenclatura
dismissed', and 'four-party coalition buried without heirs'.
These reflected the mix of drama and confusion in the face of a countrywide
protest vote that saw support switch from the Christian Democrats and their
main Socialist allies to a range of parties across the political spectrum.
Final results showed that 16 parties would be represented in the chamber of
deputies. Of these, 12 held less than 6 per cent of the vote and only the
Christian Democrats more than 20 per cent.
The populist Lombard League emerged as the main new force, capturing 9 per
cent of the vote nationwide and becoming the second largest party in
northern Italy. Mr Giulio Andreotti, the outgoing premier, is due to present
his resignation later this week to be followed on April 23 by the first
meeting of the new legislature. Between April 27 and April 30 the new
parliamentary group is due to be formed. Only when this has been completed
will it be possible to talk seriously of the formation of a new government
in what could prove a lengthy process.
However, President Francesco Cossiga has pledged to begin informal soundings
as soon as possible. He appears anxious to expedite the process, putting a
government in place before he leaves office on July 3. But the result has
also complicated negotiations, already well advanced, on the choice of a new
president.
This was expected to be Mr Andreotti but his candidature is in doubt as a
result of his party's vote falling below 30 per cent for the first time.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Yesterday's announcement by the London Stock Exchange of improvements in the
trading mechanism for shares in 120 smaller companies was a reminder that
problems at the less liquid end of the market are still largely unsolved.
After a debate worthy of the Taurus settlement project, elaborate plans for
a system of sole traders for all but the biggest 250 stocks have apparently
been scaled back to a pilot scheme involving a mere handful of companies.
The wider proposal might have suited today's market-makers, but it appeared
worryingly uncompetitive for investors, so perhaps its demise is just as
well.
Meanwhile, institutions wanting to make substantial investments in smaller
stocks continue to deal with companies' brokers rather than market-makers.
The brokers act as the equivalent of old-fashioned jobbers and arrange
transactions on a matched bargain basis: prices on the electronic trading
screens are useful for reference only. The exchange would clearly like the
whole issue to disappear but there is the awkward matter of its commitment
to all companies which pay their listing fees.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
There are two possible reactions to Italy's fragmented election result. One
is excitement that the old order has been broken, that the humbling of the
Christian Democrats will actually hasten electoral reform, reduce the size
of the public sector and increase the hitherto snail-like pace of
privatisation. The other is apprehension that the drawn-out process of inter
party negotiations - followed perhaps by fresh elections - will further
delay attempts to tackle the deficit and bring the country into line with
the monetary union disciplines prescribed by the Maastricht summit.
Judging by yesterday's 2 per cent fall in the Comit index - which itself
followed a weak performance in the month leading up to the poll - the market
seems inclined to the gloomier view. A longish period of reflection looks
inevitable, while the dwindling chances of a new government being led by Mr
Craxi - the Socialist leader with a reputation for getting things done who
was prime minister when local equities spectacularly outperformed in the mid
1980s - will hardly help short term sentiment.
Given the relatively small size of the domestic mutual fund industry - and
local investors' continued preference for bonds - Italy badly needs to
rekindle the enthusiasm of foreigners. Bourse reforms have failed to make
much outside impact, while the recent spate of poor company results is
hardly an inducement. The market remains attractive for individual stock
pickers, but bigger international fund weightings must await clearer
evidence of a political sea change.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
In many ways, Tesco's full-year figures represent another remarkable
achievement. Operating margins have risen yet again, even in the more
difficult second half. Sales per employee are up 12 per cent, profits per
employ-ee 20 per cent. And, it seems, better times are coming: 'for us', the
company says, 'the recession is moving away'. This may seem slightly at odds
with the fact that its hugely ambitious expansion programme is still
enjoying falling land prices and construction costs. But that may be a
matter of leads and lags in a consumer-driven recovery, in which case Tesco
is getting the best of both worlds.
The snag is that even in the supposed upturn, Tesco may be enjoying no
underlying volume growth at all. Current like-for-like volume, it seems, is
up by some 0.5 per cent. But all of that might be attributable to the
one-off effect of Sunday opening. Judging by last year's figures, too, the
increase in sales per square foot is slowing sharply. The 20 per cent rise
in last year's earnings, in fact, owes a good deal to recessionary
cost-cutting and an abnormally low tax charge. This year's earnings growth
will doubtless continue in double figures, in which case a prospective p/e
of 12 or so might not seem too demanding. But as the market has come to
realise, the outlook for the grocery trade further into the decade is a good
deal riskier than it seems.

FT  08 APR 92 / The Lex Column: Tokyo's vicious circle
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It is hard to believe that, as recently as 1987, the market capitalisation
of NTT was greater than that of the entire German stock market. By
yesterday, the Nikkei had fallen 23 per cent since the start of the year and
was still apparently without a floor. The abiding problem is bank stocks,
which fell 7 per cent yesterday alone. Even so, they are trading at a slight
premium to the market multiple compared with a traditional discount of some
20 per cent. That suggests the sector's correction has further to go,
especially since the banks have still to sort out the bad debt problems
created by falling property values.
After adjustment for accounting differences, export-related sectors like
electricals look cheap compared to their overseas equivalents.
Unfortunately, worries about the financial sector look like continuing to
undermine confidence in the market as a whole, not least because the banks
may yet have to sell industrial company shares to rebuild core capital after
property loan losses.
Ultimately, it looks as though the Japanese authorities will have to find a
way of supporting the banks and arresting property deflation. The banks are
already turning to subordinated debt from life insurance companies to offset
the effect of falling share prices on their Tier 2 capital. This compounds
the problem, as the insurers sell bank shares to finance the loans. It has
also eaten into the insurers' appetite for US Treasury securities,
contributing to the 50 basis point rise in the long bond yield this year. It
must be a source of concern to governments with deficits to finance that the
world's largest saver is developing such claims on its own resources.

FT  08 APR 92 / Letter: Weakness of science and wealth creation link
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Dr D A A FAGANDINI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I hope that your editorial on the blighting of British science these
past 10 years and more ('Science Matters', April 2) will be widely read and
pondered. While science everywhere always clamours for funds, there being an
infinite number of questions on the road to a Theory of Everything, it is a
fact that the UK has suffered more than most other developed countries over
the past decade.
The UK has no minister for science because only a very small minority has
any understanding of the relationship that should exist here, as it does
elsewhere, between scientific inquiry and wealth creation. As you imply, the
relationship is non-linear and hence complex. But one aspect is abundantly
clear, namely that only wealthy countries can seriously engage in serious
science.
The UK undoubtedly was, until recently and maybe still is, second to none in
the quality of its scientific community and of the work it undertook. The
weakness that is now being exposed, is the persistent delicacy with which
academe fingered the potential of its findings.
Material gain was, and still is, demeaning to too many of those dedicated to
knowledge for its own sake. The consequences and ramifications of this most
honourable posture were negligently unforeseen for a very long time. So now
we have, not only a rack of ministers and would-be ministers with no
understanding whatsoever of the role that science should play in society,
and not only a clutch of main board directors similarly maimed, but also two
or more generations of young people, trudging through an education system
that has eschewed anything that looks difficult. Most certainly they will
not be able to contribute in a significant manner to providing the
wherewithal for academics to pursue their aims.
This is indeed an unhealthy state of affairs and one can only grimace at the
tenacity of those who sing the praises of 'jewels in the education crown'
when it is all too obvious that the excellence the system can provide for
the few will ensure that they remain, for their whole working lives, grossly
underfunded. What academics must now urgently attend to is just as obvious.

FT  08 APR 92 / Foreign Affairs: Down the aisle after a long, tortuous
courtship - UK Tories and European Christian Democrats are teaming up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD MORTIMER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In the past few days the Tory election campaign has taken on a rather
anti-European tone, with Prime Minister John Major warning that 'the Lib-Lab
left would not speak for Britain in Brussels, they would speak for Brussels
in Britain', and Mr Kenneth Baker, home secretary, denouncing the Germans
for their use of proportional representation.
Meanwhile on the Continent, the banner of Christian Democracy is looking
faded. Yet by an ironic quirk this is the moment that British Toryism and
continental Christian Democracy, after a long and tortuous courtship, have
chosen to announce their nuptials.
Last night, in Strasbourg, members of the European parliament belonging to
the Christian Democrat 'European People's Party' (EPP) were to decide
whether to admit their Conservative colleagues to their parliamentary group.
Almost certainly they will have voted in favour, bowing to the wishes of
Germany's Chancellor Helmut Kohl, who is said to regard the issue as having
'a historic dimension'.
'It is a long story, but I hope with a short end,' says Mr Bernhard Salzer,
the senior German in the group, who has acted as Mr Kohl's representative.
One of the protagonists in it is none other than Mrs Margaret Thatcher,
despite her well-known suspicion of things European and her strained
relations with Mr Kohl. Always sensitive to the realities of power politics,
she was keen for her party to team up with the Christian Democrats, as the
leading Conservative force on the Continent, back in the 1970s when she was
leader of the opposition and when political parties throughout the EC were
preparing to fight the first direct elections to the European Parliament in
1979.
It is the Christian Democrats who have been playing hard to get: not so much
the Germans, who have always looked on Britain's Conservatives as natural
allies, but the Belgians and Dutch, some of the Italians, and the Irish
(Fine Gael). These parties take their 'Christian' label seriously, and do
not feel it hangs convincingly on British Toryism.
Most Christian Democrat parties have their roots in a 'social Christian'
doctrine which started as an attempt by the Catholic church to compete with
Marxism on its own ground, showing that one did not have to be an atheist to
champion workers' interests. Although Christian Democrats have accepted the
role of defenders of capitalism against socialism, they place more emphasis
than Conservatives do on the need to tame capitalism with appropriate state
intervention, and to ensure a harmonious relationship between 'the social
partners' - a phrase which baffled Mrs Thatcher until it was translated into
more idiomatic English as 'the two sides of industry', and even then was not
much to her taste.
Most Christian Democrats are keen Euro-federalists. Among such people, Mrs
Thatcher is hardly the most popular European politician. The Tory MEPs had
little chance of being admitted to the EPP group so long as she was their
party leader.
So they had to form a separate group, with the small Danish Conservative
party as their sole ally. This began to look slightly more convincing when
the Spanish Alianza Popular joined it in 1986; and Sir Christopher Prout,
who became the group's leader in 1987, hoped at one time to draw in the
French Gaullists as well. But in 1989 disaster struck. In the European
elections of that year the Conservatives lost one-third of all their seats
in Britain and two of the four they held in Denmark; and, as a crowning
humiliation, the Spaniards deserted to the EPP. Membership of the group fell
from 66 to 34.
Meanwhile, with the coming into force of the Single European Act, the
European Parliament was gaining in powers and prestige; national parties
were coming to attach more importance to the balance of political forces on
the EC level. An influx of new Labour MEPs, more dedicated than their
predecessors to working within the Socialist group and using the parliament
to promote their own political and social philosophy, tipped the balance of
the EC towards the left. Both Conservatives and Christian Democrats became
more aware of the importance of working together.
Sir Christopher decided the time had come for a new approach to the EPP, and
won Mrs Thatcher's support for an application to join their group. But these
were the years after the Bruges speech, when Mrs Thatcher was saying 'no, no
and no' to European monetary union. The application was put on ice until
after Mr Major became prime minister and proclaimed his desire to put
Britain 'where we belong - at the very heart of Europe'.
The current campaign notwithstanding, Mr Major is regarded on the Continent
as a much better European than Mrs Thatcher; and indeed better than the
Gaullists, who are now threatening to block French ratification of the
Maastricht treaty. The Gaullists have not yet applied to join the EPP,
although their ally, former President Valery Giscard d'Estaing (who himself
defected to the EPP from the Liberals last year), would like them to.
Even the 'social chapter' which Mr Major insisted on excluding from the
Treaty of Maastricht, obliging his 11 partners to adopt it as a separate
protocol, is not seen as an insuperable division. Christian Democrats
believe the chapter in its present form is no more than a set of minimum
standards which British industry could easily meet and that the UK, by
accepting it, would be better placed to influence its future development.
Privately most Tory MEPs agree. But there is a danger that the rift will
widen if the social chapter is accepted by a Kinnock government, and the
Tories in opposition react by beating an anti-European drum.
In today's Europe, so-called Socialist parties have mostly accepted
free-market and monetarist policies, while in several countries voters,
scared by unemployment and immigration, are defecting to xenophobic populist
parties. That leaves, in Mr Giscard d'Estaing's view, less scope for the
uncompromising free-market economics of a Thatcher. 'Now we are obliged,' he
says, 'to incorporate more social preoccupations. That's what we're trying
to do in France. That's why we joined the EPP last year . . . We must become
centre-right, move closer to public opinion, and put more 'social' in our
market economy. We need a combination of tolerance and firmness - notably on
immigration  - and a positive view on European union.'
Probably that is a fair description of what Mr Major is trying to do as
well, although he might not use quite those words. On the Continent, at any
rate, that is what his party's alliance with the EPP will be taken to mean.

FT  08 APR 92 / Letter: EC 'ignores' issues on fish conservation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr FREDRIK S EATON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, As reported by David Gardner ('EC urges Canada to face up to
over-fishing problem', April 2), the European Commission is attempting to
avoid its responsibility for the depletion of fish stocks off Newfoundland.
In fact, the Commission has consistently failed to accept and abide by
quotas set by the Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Organisation (NAFO), of which
the European Community is a member, in spite of its own high-minded rhetoric
about supporting 'the creation of regional fisheries organisations and the
strengthening of the existing ones'.
The facts about European Community fishing in the NAFO area are clear and
damning. For example, for the period 1986-1990, NAFO quotas for EC fleets
for ground-fish totalled 96,377 tonnes. The EC reported catches by the
Spanish and Portuguese fleets of 359,007 tonnes. The EC over-fished its
quotas by at least 262,630 tonnes according to EC records. Canadian
estimates are much higher and a considerable quantity of this catch consists
of small fish taken by undersized nets before they have a chance to
reproduce. The problem is clearly not one of 20,000 tonnes of fish as stated
by EC Fisheries Commissioner, Mr Manuel Marin, in your article.
The EC continues to ignore important NAFO conservation decisions, including
a moratorium on fishing for Northern cod outside the Canadian 200-mile
economic zone. During 1990, there were 130 EC vessels fishing off
Newfoundland, in 1991 there were 149. On the other hand, Canada has
responded to the fishery crisis by suspending the offshore fishery for
Northern cod for the first six months of 1992. There are no Canadian vessels
fishing for Northern cod while the EC continues to over-fish. Mr Marin asks
for the same treatment as Cuba; Cuba abides by its NAFO obligations. Why
doesn't Europe?

Vanessa Houlder (Property Market, April 3) has fallen into the trap of
describing Docklands as laissez-faire. Rates holidays and tax allowances are
not laissez-faire, they are dirigiste. For example, there has been no
pension fund investment in Docklands - why invest in such a risky location
if you do not need to save tax?
Regional policy has been a proven failure since the Second World War. Left
to the free market and a liberal town and country planning policy, Docklands
would have been quite different.

FT  08 APR 92 / Letter: The good manager not necessarily a good director
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr BOB GARRATT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your report on the Cadbury Committee is timely (Management: 'Getting
directors on board', April 2). The issue, though, is not just 'corporate
governance' but the selection and training of directors. There is a huge
difference between managing and directing. Wise companies are beginning to
recognise this, and are finding that good managers do not necessarily make
good directors. This challenges the current notion of a manager's career
progression.
Surveys of directors by the Institute of Directors and myself have both
found that over 90 per cent of directors, nationally and internationally,
have had no training or development in directing. The areas of formulating
policy, strategic thinking, supervision of management, and accountability to
stakeholders, are just beginning to be recognised as providing full-time
work for directors. The new centre for director development at the IoD is
heavily subscribed with people keen to understand what direction-giving is
all about. This is an area in which Britain leads the world.

<TEXT>
Sir, To a member of Lloyd's who has suffered crippling losses, the advent of
a Labour government would indeed be a double whammy ('Labour: who wins and
who loses?', April 5), but other Names able to trade through the present
difficulties will almost certainly find their membership proving to be a
useful hedge against Labour's tax plans.
Historically, membership of Lloyd's has always been of particular benefit in
eras of high taxation, so should the worst happen on Thursday, those with
the necessary means would be well advised to consider whether membership was
appropriate to their circumstances.

FT  08 APR 92 / Leading Article: Labour and the economy
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
IF THE polls are to be believed, Neil Kinnock will soon be at the head
either of a minority Labour government or of one with a paper-thin majority.
Evidence suggests that investors are no more than modestly disturbed. Are
they right to be so?
Since the election campaign opened four weeks ago, the FT-SE index has
fallen by some 120 points. This is a decline of only 5 per cent. Moreover,
the valuation of corporate earnings remains quite high by the standards of
recent years.
Meanwhile, sterling has drifted down by just 3 pfennigs, from DM2.87 to
DM2.843. This decline also seems small, but the lower bound for sterling
within the ERM is now only a whisker away. If a new Labour government were
to be tested by the exchange markets, it should act decisively. A
substantial increase in short-term interest rates is likely to have a more
powerful effect on credibility than a small one.
For this reason - though not only for this reason  - Labour's claim that
'this election is a choice between a Conservative government paralysed by
recession, and a Labour government determined to get on with building a
recovery' is hollow. The flutters of sterling would only be the first of
Labour's immediate problems. It would face two others.
Labour is committed to a Pounds 2.9bn increase in taxation on the relatively
better off in 1992-93. This shock may well worsen the current recession, by
falling most heavily on those in the best position to enter into the needed
increase in borrowing. A hung parliament might help Labour to avoid this
mistake.
Second danger
At the same time, a hung parliament is likely to exacerbate the second
danger. Labour's manifesto is a paean to the glories of increased public
spending, but the UK's public accounts are in no state to tolerate such
indulgence. Come what may, Labour must remain resolute in its determination
to spend no more than the very little extra that the country can now afford.
The near term may be difficult. But what of Labour's capacity to generate a
more rapid recovery than the Conservatives over the next several years? Like
the Conservatives, it is at the mercy of developments abroad. It could try
to influence pay bargaining, but its proposals can only make a modest
difference. Otherwise, the best it can do is to make its commitment to the
ERM as credible as possible.
The best way to do this would be to make the Bank of England operationally
independent. Mr John Smith should realise that, within the ERM, government
control of monetary policy will be seen by investors as offering freedom
only to depreciate. The result of the government control he wishes to retain
can only be higher interest rates than are necessary.
Real choice
If the chances of medium-term recovery are no greater under Labour than
under the Conservatives, economic prospects will depend on Labour's
longer-term effects on the supply side. Here, at last, is a real choice: one
between the market on the one hand, and a 'partnership' between government
and industry on the other.
Labour stresses market failure: too little investment; too little research
and development; too little training; too little manufacturing; too many
take-overs; too low wages; too uneven a regional development; and too little
infrastructure. The answers are predictable: a pinch of coercion here; more
public spending there; and a soupcon of guidance over there.
Neither in all its analysis nor in all its recommendations is Labour wrong.
Yet it talks the language of the market as if it were a foreign tongue. Can
Labour in office learn to talk the language of markets more fluently? Can it
even realise how helpful greater reliance on markets and competition could
often be to its cause?
In macroeconomic policy, Labour appears to be as bound by its commitment to
the ERM as are the Conservatives. In the short term, the costs of proving
that commitment are likely to be appreciable. In recompense, Labour promises
that its more active approach to government will undo the coils now
restraining British economic growth. The promise is appealing; its results
are likely to be disappointing.

FT  08 APR 92 / Farewell balanced books
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOE ROGALY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If Labour wins, the eye of memory will fly back to 1964. The last time the
trade unions' political arm turned the country around after 13 years of
Conservative administration many of us expected miracles. There was optimism
in the air.
This is no 1964. Mr Neil Kinnock is an uncertain quantity, Mr John Major an
uninspiring one. Both are children of modest origins. In 1964, the then Mr
Harold Wilson sold himself as the representative of modernity, progress and
science. Lord Home, who very nearly beat him, appeared to be the
personification of old-fashioned Conservatism: aristocratic, innumerate,
stuffy, out of touch. He made an ass of himself when he used matchsticks in
an effort to demonstrate how the economy worked.
Subsequent history suggests that the electoral mechanism, as is its habit,
made suckers of the electorate. The success of the Wilson confidence trick
showed how imperfect the judgment of the floating voter can be. For the
country may have done better under Lord Home. It certainly lost its way
under Labour. The seeds of the excesses of the late 1970s were sown during
the lax governance of the 1960s.
This time, the disillusionment of erstwhile Conservatives may put Labour in.
There appears to be a greater degree of disenchantment with the government
than there is mistrust of the opposition. It is an inglorious moment in our
political history. There is no gladness in the heart. This is not to say
that Mr Kinnock is misleading the public. It would be better if he were. For
what is particularly depressing about the prospect of a Labour government is
what the Labour leader says about his party's programme - namely that it
will expel the concept of the competitive market from the management of the
public services. I hope he is not telling the truth.
If he is, the government that he may form on Friday could destroy the most
valuable gift Mrs Margaret Thatcher bequeathed to the economy: a sense of
how to manage money. England is a nation that has produced a few brilliant
mathematicians and a great many arithmetical dunces. It took the
International Monetary Fund to convince the Callaghan government that there
is a relationship between cash inflow and cash outflow, and it took Mrs
Thatcher to teach this important lesson to the country.
Before the then Mr Callaghan and cash limits, public expenditure was
calculated in 'real terms', or, as we used to call it, funny money. Before
Mrs Thatcher, there was no direct connection in many peoples' minds between
'the government's' money and their own. This innocent belief in the
generosity of the Bank of Fairyland was not confined to the national
accounts. It was an article of faith in the finance departments of
nationalised industries, local authorities and public bodies of all kinds.
During the 1980s, Mrs Thatcher shattered that childish illusion. I fear that
the sad experience of the 1990s may be of a Britain struggling to sink back
into the accounting regimes of fairyland. The rot has already started: last
autumn's pre-election public spending settlement under Mr John Major would
not have been countenanced by his predecessor. It has been worsened by a
campaign in which promises to spend have been thinly disguised by phrases
such as 'as resources allow', or 'what the country can afford', reflecting
the letter, if not the spirit, of Mrs Thatcher's teachings.
Do not mistake my meaning. The constraints imposed by membership of the
exchange rate mechanism are a given. The route-lines of budgetary
convergence within the European Community are set. These may prevent the
governments of the 1990s from running amok. I am also aware of Labour's
earnest intention to control public expenditure at the macro level: Mr
Kinnock is determined to demonstrate that his renovated Labour party will
not repeat the mistakes of the 1970s.
What concerns me is the potential for waste at the micro level. If Labour
gets in, compulsory competitive tendering will be abolished, except as a
'last resort'. The NHS reforms, which should encourage the cutting of
unnecessary costs, will be reversed. This is not replacing care with
capitalism, as one small tale shows. On a radio phone-in yesterday, an
ambulance driver had Mr Kinnock nonplussed. He spoke of a potential
ambulance services trust. It would sell its skills as an in-house training
unit and plough the money back. The Labour leader recovered after a while
and said that would be ok as an extra, but not if the service depended on
it.
In its talk of 'underfunding' of the social services, Labour never shows
awareness of the value of such little bursts of beneficial enterprise. It
does not value competition. It has only recently become acquainted with
markets. It talks often of spending, rarely of reducing expenditure. It has
learned a great deal about public accounting since 1964, but on the evidence
of this campaign not quite enough. Not yet.

FT  08 APR 92 / Mandate to mend a broken system: Italy must reform or face
relegation within Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The fall of the Berlin wall has claimed its last victim, Italy's Christian
Democrat party.
The party's dominance of post-war Italian politics, unprecedented in Europe,
relied in the last resort on its appeal as a bastion against the powerful
Communist party winning power through the ballot box. The collapse of
communism has robbed the Christian Democrats of this protective clothing.
Italian voters in Sunday's general election revealed the Christian Democrats
to be a corrupt political machine, hungry for power but bankrupt of ideas,
and led by an ageing elite which has lost touch with a groundswell of
opinion clamouring for change.
With their support dropping below the psychological barrier of 30 per cent
for the first time, an era has ended. The Christian Democrats, though still
the largest party, can no longer exercise their extensive rights of
patronage and orchestrate the political system to their advantage, which
they have done for 46 years. Italy now faces a profoundly new political
geography, and uncertainty as to who will form the next government.
The election result will take time to digest. But politicians realise that
an agenda has been set by a combination of popular demand and the dictates
of the European Community in Brussels. If Italy is to fulfil the obligations
contracted at the Maastricht summit to converge with its EC partners, urgent
and decisive measures are needed to reduce the country's huge public sector
deficit, now approaching 11 per cent of gross domestic product, and to
revive a stagnant economy which grew at 1.4 per cent last year, the lowest
since 1983.
A precondition for such measures must be a government backed by a
broad-based consensus from the political parties. This is only likely if
common ground can be found for reforming the electoral system to favour
larger government majorities. Last June's overwhelming endorsement of a
referendum abolishing the much-abused system of multi-preference votes was
the first signal. Two other referendums, proposed by Mr Mario Segni, one of
the few new Christian Democrat faces, and introducing elements of a
first-past-the-post system, are being considered by the courts. And a
significant cross section of the new deputies committed themselves before
the election to ensuring these reforms prosper.
The dangers of ungovernability are real. The country's complex system of
proportional representation, grafted with the best democratic intention of
accommodating every shade of opinion, has produced a parliament so fractured
as to be almost unworkable. In Italy's 11th post-war legislature no fewer
than 16 different parties will be represented in the chamber of deputies. Of
these, 12 possess less than 6 per cent of the vote, and of the remaining
four only the Christian Democrats have more than 20 per cent.
However, voters were well aware that they were stepping into the unknown on
Sunday. The problem they confronted was the absence of a clearly defined
opposition. Hence it was not surprising that votes were widely spread: nor
that the greatest upset came in the north where the populist Lombard League
(see below) burst on to the scene.
The latter stages of the election campaign devolved into a simplified
version of 'them' and 'us'. On one side were the Christian Democrats and
their junior partners in the outgoing four-party coalition - the Socialists,
the Social Democrats (PSDI), the Liberals (PLI) - arguing they alone were
capable of managing the economy and reforming the electoral system.
On the other were nine groupings with a chance of serious parliamentary
representation. These included such disparate forces as the neo-Fascist MSI,
the small centre-left Republicans, the Lombard League, the Sicilian-based
reformist movement The Network (La Rete), and the former communists split
between the mainstream new Party of the Democratic Left (PDS) and the
hardline Reconstructed Communism. Although they were united in wishing to
break the government coalition, they had no common platform.
Their spoiling role worked, however, reducing the four-party coalition to 47
per cent of the vote. The coalition can muster a 16-seat majority in the
630-seat chamber, but on the admission of its own supporters it has lost the
credibility to form a government, let alone to last a five-year term. The
73-year-old Mr Giulio Andreotti, the outgoing Christian Democrat prime
minister, bears much responsibility for the party's slide from 34 per cent
to 29 per cent. Mr Arnaldo Forlani, a potential prime minister, has offered
his resignation as Christian Democrat party secretary in the wake of the
result. Mr Bettino Craxi, the Socialist leader, has also lost face, as his
party's vote fell below 14 per cent. He had previously said this would be
the minimum necessary for accepting the job of forming the next government.
In addition to the damage done to the reputation of the main political
figures in the outgoing government, too many contentious social and economic
issues were ducked because they were liable to split the coalition. At the
top of the list comes reform of Italy's generous state pension scheme, which
has been under consideration for more than five years and is one of the main
causes of the budget deficit. Privatisation has been written in to provide
significant funds to hold down the budget deficit this year but no party has
been able to agree on what should be privatised and where the proceeds
should go. The question of reducing aid to the south, which involves cutting
political patronage, has been sidestepped, while a proposal to shake up the
armed forces to produce a more professional military is on hold.
Any permutation of governing coalition to meet these challenges is now
possible. Even the Christian Democrats, Socialists and former communists
(PDS) could link up, in a group which would command the strongest
cross-party support. But any of the new partners will demand electoral
reform as its price for support and an end to the Christian Democrats'
hegemony. A consensus of the main parties could decide that the most viable
way forward is to treat the next parliament as a form of constituent
assembly, exclusively concerned with initiating electoral reforms for a new
legislature on which the electorate would vote within two years.
President Francesco Cossiga will have a significant role in the uncertain
weeks ahead. He is determined to form a government as quickly as possible
before his old mandate expires on July 3. His unpredictable nature, canny
sense of popular sentiment and desire to knock heads together could produce
an unpredictable coalition or even a temporary government of technocrats.
But in the last resort everything hinges on the ability of the politicians
to recognise the seriousness of Italy's predicament. The Christian Democrats
and their Socialist allies claim the commitment to Europe at Maastricht was
the outgoing administration's greatest achievement. If they do not now show
a sense of unity, Italy will fail to heal a dangerous north-south divide and
risk being relegated to Europe's second division.

For most people the first question seems to be 'Where can I get away from
these wretched politicians?' and the second 'What will make me laugh?'
Tonight there are three comedy repeats: Only Fools And Horses (8.00 BBC1),
in which Del is invited to a school reunion at Dockside Secondary Modern; a
60-minute edition of one of the best American comedies for 20 years, The
Golden Girls (10.00 C4), featuring clips from earlier episodes; and the TV
newsroom satire, Drop The Dead Donkey (11.00 C4), with Dave seeking
psychiatric advice.
The only new comedy is a special Spitting Image, which is devoted to the
election (10.40 TV). This might well be the best night for such a programme,
but alas the series is well beyond its peak.
Other non-election possibles include the second of the Timewatch programmes
about the weird Elizabeth Nietzsche, who returned from her Aryan ghetto in
Paraguay in 1889 to become one of the most influential women in Hitler's
Germany (8.10 BBC2). The documentary series Letters From St Petersburg
returns to C4 (9.45) and QED considers the plight of the leaning tower of
Pisa (9.50 BBC1).

Moscow City Ballet has returned to these shores for another tour with its
versions of Sleeping Beauty and Swan Lake. It would be pleasant to report
that, after last year's visit, the company had improved its presentation of
Beauty, that most difficult of ballets, but the staging (as I saw it last
Friday night) remains pauperishly the same.
The setting is gimcrack, the costuming mostly risible where it is not
frankly embarrassing in its inadequacies. The King (Fauntleroy XIV) wears a
mustard-coloured lurex knickerbocker suit, embellished with touches of
Soviet lace, and sports a page-boy wig with tinsel crown-ette. (His coiffure
is, though, rivalled by the long golden locks sported by a lurid young gent
among the courtiers, industriously impersonating Veronica Lake). Other
characters are kitted out in garments that should have been left behind in
an Omsk thrift-shop. About the company shoes, I can but report that they
must be among the grubbiest and most dispiriting I have ever seen on stage.
The coloured programme book - no bargain at Pounds 3  - declares that the
aim of Viktor Smirnov-Golovanov, director of the troupe, is 'to teach his
young company the original ideas of the great 19th century choreographers'.
A pity, then, that the Beauty text is so oddly edited, and that certain
emendations (the Prologue's 'finger' variation; the dances for the fairy
cavaliers; the hunt scene) should be so undistinguished. Yet, as with last
season's appearances when Ludmila Semenyaka was the invited star, there is a
reason to watch Moscow City Ballet.
The casting of Yury Posokhov (a guest from the Bolshoy) in certain
performances is of real importance. We have greatly admired him with his
parent company. He shines now like the best of deeds in the naughtiest of
worlds. He shows us the Prince as poet. His physique is ideal, harmonious;
his style noble; his technique fluent, elegant in placing and pose, generous
in scale. The role acquires thereby an inevitability, a natural distinction,
that give it immediate and splendid meaning - we understand the later
development of the action on the terms of Posokhov's presence.
Like Oleg Sokolov, great interpreter of the Prince with the Kirov in the
1960s, he incarnates an idea of aristocratic behaviour that lies at the core
of a premier danseur's art. We are aware of blood-lines going back to le Roi
Soleil. That Posokhov also suggests something of the Prince's dreaming,
visionary nature in the hunt scene, lends an imaginative depth to the
reading.
His Aurora was the young, beautiful Yevgenia Vorobieva. Her dancing is
serenely easy, and her gently absorbed air - she is caught up in the role,
and plays it with a bewitching decorum of manner - brings something utterly
sincere and touching to the character and to the classic dance. For the
rest, Yulia Snegurova was a gracious Lilac fairy; the female corps de ballet
worked industriously: they all merit vastly better surroundings for their
gifts.
Moscow City Ballet on tour: Manchester Opera House until April 11; Sadler's
Wells Theatre, April 13-18; Paignton Festival Theatre, April 20-25.

FT  08 APR 92 / Arts: Guillaume Tell and Les Contes d'Hoffmann - Opera
revivals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAX LOPPERT and RICHARD FAIRMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Rossini's final operatic masterpiece made its return to the Royal Opera two
years ago, after a gap of a century. The wait for its first revival has been
considerably less protracted: this being the composer's bicentenary year,
Tell now forms one of the house's two big celebratory events (the new
Viaggio a Reims follows in July).
This time, the celebration is not in name only. A hugely rewarding evening
of French Grand Opera is on offer: an inspired but demanding work given with
a sufficient degree of impassioned commitment to set the conflagration
roaring. In 1990 the carefully considered naturalism of John Cox's
production (plain old-fashioned, to some) and the somewhat sedate warmth of
Michel Plasson's conducting were attributes one respected rather than
admired; there was a tentative air about the first performance that
prevented even the most ardent of the opera's fans from recording
unconditional pleasure in its return.
On the evidence of Monday's performance, the staging now rises nobly to the
occasion. The opera shows itself a mighty arched span of linked themes and
destinies, grand not merely in generic description but in spirit, sound and
dramatic purpose. Singing, not just impassioned but supple in moulding, is
in short supply, and there still seems a touch of the bargain-basement about
some of the costumes.
Sometimes one notes unevennesses in the ensemble; sometimes the orchestral
underpinning is less dramatically charged than it can be. But Plasson's
overflowing love for the work seems to infect the whole cast and (much
improved) chorus: the opera's final paean to liberty - sublime passage] -
sweeps into the theatre with a fervour that is obviously unfeigned.
The transformation in the original cast-members proves no less impressive.
Gregory Yurisich in the title role is a firebrand, vocally rough-hewn and
dramatically electrifying. Chris Merritt has learnt to use his astonishing
tenor instrument for more than just isolated effects: in spite of momentary
pitch-lapses, his Arnold affords a proud sample of heroic bel canto, and a
fully-felt account of the character that makes one tolerant of his
shortcomings as an actor.
There are precise, distinctive contributions from Linda Kitchen (a lovely,
unaffectedly boyish Jemmy), Ian Caley (Rodolphe), Roderick Earle (Leuthold)
and a bald-pated Stafford Dean as the villain Gesler. Jane Eaglen, the new
Mathilde, boldly unleashes her gleaming dramatic soprano - the subtler
points of style may want polishing but the overall impact is formidable.
Patricia Bardon's rich-toned Hedwige, also new, adds lustre to every scene
in which she takes part.
This is a long, slowly-unfolding opera of cumulative magnificence, an opera
that matters.
Meanwhile, Les Contes d'Hoffmann is coming towards the end of its glittering
run of per-formances. Since this production was new in 1980, there have been
tales to tell of the various star singers who have shone in its multiple
roles and this revival has been no exception, thanks to an almost ideal
initial trio of leading ladies.
In the last few performances, however, it is the men who have claimed
attention. Last week Patrick Power took over as Hoffmann.
It was an appearance made at short notice when the expected tenor (Neil
Shicoff) fell ill, but carried out with no loss of dramatic involvement in
the opera as a whole.
What Mr Power lacks in vocal weight, he gains in elegance; what he lacks in
charisma as the youthful Hoffmann, he made up in the scenes of grizzled and
drunken despair.
For charisma one had to turn instead to his adversary, played in all his
guises at these last performances by Samuel Ramey. He makes the most of this
quadruple role to give us more vividly coloured character-playing than he
sometimes manages, especially as the satanic Dr Miracle, while still singing
with the marvellous focus to the voice that has always been his hallmark.
The last performance is on Saturday. Highly recommended.

SmithKline Beecham, the Anglo-American drugs group, has now completed
post-merger restructuring in its European pharmaceuticals operations,
according to Jan Leschly, division chairman.
The appointment of Charles Woler as chairman of European pharmaceuticals
operations is the final move in a fundamental reorganisation which has left
in place only two of the 14 most senior pharmaceutical managers at the time
of the merger. Half of the 12 new appointees, like Woler, have come from
outside the group, while half have been internal promotions.
Woler was previously at the Paris-based Cider group, and before that was in
charge of pharmaceutical, animal health and certain chemical operations in
France for Hoffmann-La Roche. Leschly says Woler's experience, as a doctor
and MBA graduate, would allow him to tackle the regulatory and commercial
challenges of the European market over the next five years.
Woler's predecessor, Martyn Greenacre, who moved to Europe following the

FT  08 APR 92 / Business and the Environment: Going up in smoke - How
companies are cashing in on Mexico's pollution problems
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAMIAN FRASER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mexico, which a few years ago had some of the weakest and most poorly
enforced anti-pollution laws anywhere, is looking to clean up its famously
foul environment. The prospect of a multi-billion dollar market in clean-up
work is drawing in pollution-control companies from around the world.
Chemical Waste Management, a subsidiary of the US Waste Management Inc, has
recently set up an office in Mexico City and sees the overall market to be
worth Dollars 10bn (Pounds 5.8bn) by the end of the century, with the
industry growing even faster than the US market over the past decade.
'They (government officials) have the regulations in place. They know the
problems in the US and Europe. We feel they are going to push harder and
harder,' says David McConnel, manager of Chemical Waste Management's Mexico
office.
The country's list of environmental problems is depressingly long. Mexico
City's air pollution is among the worst in the world; the US-Mexican border
at places looks like a giant rubbish dump; Mexico's rivers and lakes and
open spaces are invariably polluted with toxic effluent; throughout Mexico
there is an acute shortage of water.
However, the government has begun to enforce regulations that are
approaching the level of strictness in the US. Last month the US and Mexico
unveiled a Dollars 840m joint plan to clean up the border area.
Manuel Camacho Solis, Mexico City's mayor, also ordered the city's largest
industries to buy anti-pollution equipment to help cut emissions of
suspended particulate matter by 90 per cent, nitrogen dioxide by 50 per cent
and solvents by 10-15 per cent in 18 months.
In the past, government regulations have usually been ignored, and no doubt
enforcement will continue to be weak. But there is reason to believe the
government is more sincere in the latest crackdown. Mexico hopes to sign a
free trade agreement with the US in the next 12 months, and its
environmental record will be scrutinised closely by the US Congress.
The environment is becoming an increasingly important political issue in
Mexico, and officials that do not enforce regulations risk losing their
jobs. Government rhetoric has thus stepped up a notch and industries which
fail to comply with standards are being closed down.
'As of now, every business (in Mexico City) knows that for the second
semester of 1994, if it cannot or will not adapt its production, it will
have to close or relocate outside of the Valley of Mexico,' said Patricio
Chirinos, minister for the environment, when unveiling the new plan for
Mexico City.
already, in response to the new regulations, 40 industries and 12 mines in
Mexico City have promised to spend Dollars 52m on buying scrubbers, filters
and energy saving devices - mostly from US companies such as the Clean Air
Group, Owen Rust Engineering and Northrop.
The government has promised more than Dollars 1bn in subsidised loans to
Mexican industries intent on reducing their emissions. Rene Altimirano, a
senior official at the environment ministry, says Mexico's industries would
have to invest a total of around Dollars 7bn if they were to comply with
existing regulations.
While Mexico City's air pollution grabs all the attention, the greatest
business opportunity in the short term probably lies in water treatment and
transportation. The Mexico City metropolitan area uses about 60 cubic metres
of water a second (60,000 litres per second), of which about 42 cubic metres
comes from underground water and 18 cubic metres from outside the city. The
government reckons that the underground aquifers are over-exploited by about
20 cubic metres a second, and that they will need a replacement source in
five years.
Carlos Cassasus, a senior official at Mexico City's planning office, says
about 4 cubic metres per second can be freed up by encouraging industries
and agriculture to use recyclable water. This would require, says Cassasus,
an investment of about Dollars 160m in water treatment plants.
The government has still not decided whether the transport of water will be
fully opened to private investment. But officials freely admit that they are
strapped for cash and 'creative financing' schemes are envisaged. The rest
of Mexico City's replacement water will have to be brought from the
Cutzamala system at a cost of about Dollars 900m in pump and pipe
investment.
The shortage of Mexico City's water mirrors what is happening in the rest of
the country, especially along the heavily industrialised Mexican-US border.
Only about 5 to 10 per cent of water is recycled, against about 70 per cent
in the US. Mexico City, Nuevo Leon and Queretero all regularly turn away
industries because of water shortages.
Alfonso Ruiz, of Cydsa, the large industrial conglomerate which has opened
an environmental business division, reckons that the private sector water
treatment industry will be worth at least Dollars 1bn by the end of the
decade, against next to nothing now. His company already has 50 industrial
clients that want treatment plants built for them, and is actively looking
for foreign partners to help meet demand.
Chemical Waste and a sister company hope to profit from providing sites for
treatment of solid and chemical waste. In the entire country there is only
one operating landfill site for hazardous waste, three incinerators, seven
recycling plants and about 50 landfills suitable for solid waste.
Until now, most Mexican-based industries have dumped toxic rubbish in
rivers, lakes or spare land. Altimirano says Mexico needs at least five more
incinerators - at a minimum cost of Dollars 14m each  - 30 recycling plants
and another 30 landfills suitable for toxics.
Chemical Waste is looking to build three landfills for toxic waste, and says
it will be investing at least Dollars 5m a year. A sister company will be
building solid waste sites.
Investing in Mexico's anti-pollution industry is not without its risks,
however. Environmentalists are demanding that clean-up industries comply
with particularly exacting standards, while corruption and poor enforcement
will continue to plague the business. But environmental laws are sure to get
tougher as Mexico develops, and more and more of the country's resources
will inevitably be devoted to abating the worst effects of
industrialisation.

FT  08 APR 92 / FT Law Report: Bank fraud issue can be tried
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RACHEL DAVIES, Barrister
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OWENS BANK LTD v BRACCO AND ANOTHER House of Lords (Lord Griffiths, Lord
Bridge of Harwich, Lord Ackner, Lord Goff of Chieveley and Lord
Browne-Wilkinson): April 1 1992
DEFENCE allegations that a Commonwealth judgment was obtained by fraud can
be tried in English proceedings to register the judgment, irrespective of
whether or not there is fresh evidence to establish fraud.
The House of Lords so held when dismissing an appeal by the plaintiff, Owens
Bank Ltd, from a Court of Appeal decision that an issue be tried as to
whether a judgment obtained by the bank in St Vincent and the Grenadines
against the defendants, Mr Fulvio Bracco and Bracco Industria Chimica SpA,
had been obtained by fraud. Questions on an issue relating to the Civil
Jurisdiction and Judgments Act 1982 had been referred to the European Court.
LORD BRIDGE said that the bank had applied to register a judgment of the St
Vincent High Court against Mr Bracco and Bracco Industria for more than 10m
Swiss francs.
After initial registration Bracco applied for an issue to be tried under
section 9(2)(d) of the Administration of Justice Act 1920 as to whether the
St Vincent judgment had been obtained by fraud
Sir Peter Pain gave judgment in favour of Bracco. The bank's appeal was
dismissed.
The bank's claim in the St Vincent action was that on January 31 1979 Mr
Armando Nano, the bank's managing director acting on its behalf, lent Bracco
Industria SFr9m.
The bank said the loan was acknowledged on documents signed by Mr Bracco,
which gave the St Vincent court jurisdiction in the event of dispute. Mr
Bracco denied the transaction, asserting that no loan had been agreed, no
cash had been handed over, and that the loan documents were forgeries.
In the St Vincent court after the bank's case was closed, Bracco sought to
set up a new defence that the signatures on the loan documents were genuine
but had originally appeared in the wide margins of a different contract;
that the margins had been cut off; and that Mr Nano or someone on his behalf
had typed in the rest of the document.
The court did not permit Bracco to set up that defence at such a late stage,
and gave judgment for the bank. An appeal was dismissed.
Before, during and after the St Vincent proceedings, criminal and civil
proceedings were commenced in Italy in which the issue of fraud had been
raised. Mr Nano and a co-defendant had been convicted of certain charges and
the loan documents were held to be forgeries.
Section 9 of the 1920 Act provided that, where judgment had been obtained in
the Dominions, the judgment creditor might apply to the High Court within 12
months to have it registered.
Subsection (2)(d) provided that no judgment should be registered 'if . . .
the judgment was obtained by fraud'.
The bank submitted that section 9(2)(d) must be construed as qualified by
the Common Law rule that an unsuccessful party could not challenge a
judgment on the ground that it was obtained by fraud, unless he could prove
the fraud by fresh evidence which was not available to him and could not
have been discovered with reasonable diligence before judgment was
delivered. Here, it was said, there was no such fresh evidence.
That was the rule to be applied in an action to set aside an English
judgment on the ground that it was obtained by fraud.
The question was whether a defendant seeking to resist enforcement of a
foreign judgment, either by Common Law action or statutory machinery, was in
the same position as a plaintiff seeking to set aside an English judgment on
the ground that it was obtained by fraud, and could therefore only rely on
evidence which satisfied the English rule.
A foreign judgment given by a court of competent jurisdiction was treated by
the Common Law as imposing a legal obligation on the judgment debtor, which
was enforceable by an English court in an action in which the defendant
would not be permitted to reopen issues of fact or law decided against him
by the foreign court.
In Abouloff v Oppenheimer (1882) 10 QBD 295 Lord Coleridge CJ said: 'It is a
principle of law that no action can be maintained on the judgment of a court
either in this country or in any other, which has been obtained by fraud.'
Lord Justice Brett said: 'The defendants will not be barred at the trial of
this action from making the same charge of fraud and from adducing the same
evidence in support of it.'
In Vadala v Lawes (1890) 25 QBD 310 Lord Justice Lindley said what the
judgments in Abouloff amounted to was that, 'if the fraud upon the foreign
court consists in the fact that the plaintiff has induced that court by
fraud to come to a wrong conclusion, you can reopen the whole case even
although you will have in this court to go into the very facts which were
investigated, and which were in issue in the foreign court'.
Those decisions had been criticised by academic writers and had not been
followed in the Canadian courts.
If the issue were governed only by Common Law, it would have been necessary
to examine in detail the authorities prior to Abouloff.
But that was not the position.
Enforcement in the UK of Commonwealth judgments was governed by section 9 of
the 1920 Act. Enforcement of judgments in countries with which the UK had
concluded reciprocal enforcement arrangements was governed by the foreign
Judgments (Reciprocal Enforcement) Act 1933. It provided by section
4(1)(a)(iv) that registration was to be set aside if the registering court
was satisfied 'that the judgment was obtained by fraud'.
The 1920 Act was preceded by a report in 1919 of a committee chaired by Lord
Sumner on 'the Conduct of Legal Proceedings between Parties in this Country
and Parties Abroad and the Enforcement of Judgments and Awards'.
The report commented adversely on adoption of a principle of strict
reciprocity giving all judgments within the Empire equal status and currency
in all parts of the Empire. The committee accepted the criticism and
recommended a much more cautious approach. That caution led to
recommendations which were directly implemented by section 9(1) and
(2)(a)-(e) of the 1920 Act.
Even without reference to the Sumner Report, section 9(2)(d) would have to
be construed with reference to the Common Law as understood in 1920.
But the context in which the recommendations came to be embodied in section
9(2) left no room for doubt.
Having rejected the strict reciprocity principle, the committee's
recommendation, that fraud should be one of the express bars to enforcement
of a Commonwealth judgment, could only have been intended to apply the much
wider rule applied in Abouloff and Vadala. Section 9(2)(d) must be construed
accordingly.
An English judgment was final and conclusive as to the issues decided.
It was to preserve that finality that any attempt to reopen litigation, even
on the ground of fraud, had to be confined within very restrictive limits.
In Abouloff and Vadala the Common Law declined to accord the same finality
to foreign judgments, but preferred to give primacy to the principle that
fraud unravelled everything.
Section 9(2)(d) of the 1920 Act, construed as it must be, as an adoption of
the Common Law approach to foreign judgments, specifically denied finality
to the judgment if it could be shown to have been obtained by fraud.
There might be a strong case in the 1990s in favour of according overseas
judgments the same finality as English judgments. But enforcement of
overseas judgments was now primarily governed by the 1920 and 1933 Acts.
The whole field was effectively governed by statute and if the law was now
in need of reform it was for the legislature, not the judiciary, to effect
it.

FT  08 APR 92 / Management: Waxing lyrical on cholesterol - Health Check
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DR MICHAEL MCGANNON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Anybody who is serious about health and fitness cannot afford to ignore
cholesterol. No matter how religiously you exercise, your chances of having
a heart attack may not change much unless you also find some way to regulate
this waxy substance.
There has been much research into the role of cholesterol in heart disease,
but what is known for sure?
Cholesterol is a family of waxy substances necessary to life. It is needed
for the production of hormones and membranes; it is also important for fat
digestion.
Cholesterol is broken down into different types depending on its density:
Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) - the so-called 'bad' cholesterol  - is
thought to be responsible for waxy cholesterol deposits in the arteries. The
lower the level of LDL, the better. This means bringing your weight under
control and restricting your intake of saturated fats. In particular, go
easy on red meat - beef, pork and lamb  - all cheeses, butter and lard.
High-density lipoprotein (HDL) - the so-called 'good' cholesterol  - is
charged with the delivery of cholesterol to the liver for processing and
elimination. The more HDL, the better for the heart. In order to increase
the level of HDL, stop smoking and take more exercise.
Experts agree that knowing your total cholesterol level is not enough: to
understand how your blood fats are affecting the condition of your heart,
you must know the relationship between the total cholesterol level and your
HDL. This is a measurement that your doctor should make routinely as part of
a standard health check-up.
According to the National Health Laboratories (USA), the range for this
ratio is from under 3 for vegetarians (who eat very little animal fat) and
marathon runners (who are thin and take a lot of exercise) to more than 23
for those with chronic, hyper-cholesterol problems.
If you maintain your ratio at around 3.5, you will cut the risk of heart
disease to half the average. The range for an typical male victim of heart
attack is 5.5 to 6.1.
Instead of embarking on a drastic nutritional plan, try first this practical
strategy designed to achieve long-term success:
The first step is to take stock. Count the number of meals that you eat
every week that have saturated fats in them - including any butter, red
meat, cheese, and the coconut or palm oil used in cereals, muesli and candy
bars.
If you find that 20 out of 21 meals contain saturated fats, eliminate the
fat in only four (20 per cent).
So now you are still enjoying some of the richer foods that are generally
part of business life, while moving in the right direction. We are are going
for the 'cure' here which allows you to decrease your fat intake, reducing a
concentrated source of calories as well as slowing total cholesterol
synthesis by the liver.
You can accelerate the process of cholesterol control by consuming pectin
fibre (found in apples and citrus fruits). Remember: 'An apple a day keeps
the doctor away'.
Re-check your ratio after three months. By choosing a relatively modest 20
per cent decrease in 'fat meals' to start with, you leave yourself plenty of
margin to manoeuvre in either direction once you re-check your ratio.
The new ratio will give you an indication of how far you still have to go.
Keep a graph the trend over time and follow it yourself, with your doctor's
guidance.
Lastly, do not attempt to try to obtain a total cholesterol:high-density
lipoprotein ratio of around 3.5 in several weeks: this will result in
failure and a possible rebound in the ratio. Instead, dedicate the next six
to 12 months to bringing your cholesterol under control and to doing your
heart a favour.

FT  08 APR 92 / Management: Russian reformers use their loaf - The role of
the humble plastic bag
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The renewal of the former Soviet Union suggests vast projects, grand plans,
the disbursement of fortunes. Actually, two small tables with two little
piles of plastic bags are what it can come down to.
They stand at the end of a production line in Moscow's Vikhino bread
factory: 30 times a minute, two women pick up a baton of the standard white
bread, slip open a bag, put in the bread, and fasten it with a tab dispensed
from a spring-loaded magazine. Low-tech with high hopes for large returns.
Reforming the Soviet Union may as well start with bread since a high value
is placed on its uninterrupted arrival in the shops. In spite of hectic
warnings throughout the winter about food shortages, the problem has not
been a lack of the basic ingredients, especially grain, which has been
bought on credits from Canada and the US.
Much more worrying is the equipment in the factories - some of it pre-1939
and needing constant attention, with no funds available for wholesale
replacement.
Moscow's bread industry is a simple one. Five mills deliver flour to 24
bread factories and 38 bakeries: they in turn produce an average of 2,400
tonnes of bread a day for 1,420 ordinary and specialist bread shops.
Consumption is lower, however, because there is a lot of waste, although the
average person still eats 131 kg a year, some 14 kg a year higher than the
Ministry of Health recommends as healthy.
The factories turn out a range of bread: the standard white batons like
small French loaves: a chewy brown loaf; a range of special breads; and
cakes and pastries. In Vikhino, the machinery is relatively modern, but the
factory rather dirty. While I was there, one bread line was out of action,
with some 20 engineers ripping it apart for overhaul.
In the loading bay, trucks with 'Khleb' (bread) stencilled on their peeling
sides line up for loading: there are three bays, though only one is in use,
the others being blocked with broken down equipment.
In the factory itself, there is the impression, common to all post-Soviet
plants, of a great many people doing not very much. A woman by one
production line was tending a little pot on a fire beneath one of the ovens
which contained her lunch. A pile of plastic screens - originally put up to
separate out the manufacturing processes - lie in one corner, with much of
the plastic ripped away, stolen by the workers.
Of 1,000 workers, less than 100 are employed on the production line: the
rest work behind stained doors with titles like 'legal department' and
'economic department'.
In one office stand two telephones which are staffed between seven in the
morning and three in the afternoon. During that time, they ring constantly
as managers from the bread shops file their daily orders.
Any shop which does not get through during these hours, or calls after them
 -a common occurrence  - does not get its daily bread. There is no such
thing as standard ordering patterns.
The Moscow Bread Company was aware of its problems: in October last year,
Andersen Consulting started to examine the production and supply system,
with a view to implementing change. The Andersen team - led in Moscow by
Stephen Zatland who was assisted by managers from Rank Hovis McDougall and
the APV baking machinery group and paid for by the British Know-How Fund -
has now completed the examination.
Zatland and his team found that the standard white loaf had a fresh life of
about 16 hours from when it left the ovens. They also found that some of the
bread was stale before it even left the factory, since some batches stood in
the loading bays for much of the day or night before being loaded.
Even if despatched quickly, the loaves arrived in the shops with only a few
hours of freshness left. Indeed, in all Russian bread shops, little
spoon-like instruments are provided so that customers can press the loaves
to see if they are worth buying. If the bread is stale, the shop may have no
saleable bread for hours: hence people must wait in line to get something
edible.
The Andersen team came up with plastic bags. Plastic bags, says Zatland,
prolong the eating life of a white loaf from 16 hours to two or three days.
However, plastic is a prized commodity in the former Soviet Union.
In western Europe, packaging is a Dollars 50bn industry, but in the Soviet
Union it hardly exists. Where 95 per cent of food is packaged for sale in
the advanced economies, in the former Soviet Union, the figure is around 2
per cent. Thus, when plastic bags were proposed for the bread, the bags
themselves could not be found in Russia (though a supplier is now going into
business to meet demand): the bags on the Vikhino line are supplied by BP.
Richard Budd, the Andersen consultant who works in Vikhino, has ensured that
the bread to be packaged is the best and freshest on the racks. He has the
packaging rate up to 30 loaves a minute on two of the three shifts of the
24-hour day. Cheerful amid the noisy gloom of the factory, he says that
'this is one of the most forward thinking factories we've found: very
progressive. They think strategically here - that's why we chose it for the
bags'.
Vladimir Panichev, the director, experiments with different types of bread
and rolls in small batches between the standard loaves. But because bread
prices are still fixed while cake prices are free, he has tended to switch
resources into the latter to reap higher profits. He has managed to develop
a staff which does at least some work.
The sale of the packaged bread is being market-tested with the aid of
questionnaires: not surprisingly, people said they would certainly buy a
loaf in a bag - since the bag itself is a free gift. There was resistance to
paying extra for it, since the price of bread itself has gone up sharply and
will go up still further. However, the Andersen team decided to put an extra
rouble on the price of the loaf to show that there is no such thing as a
free anything.
Other changes are also being made - one of them training shop staff in basic
courtesies. Moscow shop assistants are famous for their rudeness: a raw,
full throated hostility can meet a customer who, for example, asks for
something that is not available, or is slow to produce money.
The Andersen people believe they may even get the shops to abolish the
three-queue system: one to find out what is available, and to discover its
cost; a second to queue at the cash desk to acquire a slip for the correct
amount of the purchase; and the third to exchange the slip for the
commodity.
Zatland found that there was no one in the factory who could see the overall
picture. 'Everyone we met in the industry at senior management level was
knowledgeable, but only about his own sector,' says Zatland. 'The head of
the transport division had ideas about better transportation: the people at
the mills had ideas about milling.'
He would like to see the appointment of a 'Mr Bread' for Moscow, perhaps
even for Russia. Mr Bread would be charged with producing the big picture
and making the pieces fit within it.
Bread works in Moscow: but it works badly, scraping by on antiquated
machines and crazy systems. Skilled engineers curse clapped out lines,
keeping them going only with a vast expenditure of energy on waiting,
shouting and abusing. Getting Muscovites their bread freshly, quickly and
cheerfully would be a labour of Hercules: yet it is one of the easier
challenges in this raucous and desperate museum of socialist economy.

FT  08 APR 92 / Jobs: How recession-bound staff view their work - Employees
believe companies have coped well with hard times, but recovery may take
them aback
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL DIXON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HEY, catch an eyeful of what follows] Its author, British, is comparing the
jobs out-look at the time of writing with conditions in the mid-1970s:
'One happy difference between then and now is that, in economically advanced
nations at least, people reaching the age of 16 today have far better work
prospects . . . . Happily, too, the coming shortage of youngsters seems sure
to reverse one of the most depressing trends . . , the growing liability of
people aged 40-plus not only to be thrown out of work, but to be ruled out
of consideration for other jobs that were available.'
Rich, eh? Whether to laugh or cry at it will probably be a hard decision
even for the thousands now in the said pickle at well under 40 years old.
And do you know who wrote it?
I did, that's who. Just three years and three months ago.
What summoned the ludicrous spectre from the deep was the arrival of a
survey* from the Wyatt management consultancy, albeit not one of the
executive-pay kind *Work UK 1991. Pounds 30+vat from Wyatt Co, 21 Tothill
St, London SW1H 9LL; tel 071-222-8033, fax 071-222 9182.
regularly reported here. It was an update of an extensive study of British
workers' attitudes to their jobs and companies, which was made by Wyatt in
late 1988. That naturally sent me looking back to see what had been said
about the earlier findings, and . . . well, the only thing that saved it
from suppression was the realisation that I'd believed it, every word. Nor
was I alone in wearing such rosy-coloured spectacles.
Which suggests there has been a marked change in perspective between the two
studies - a shift which provides an illuminating context for the differences
in attitudes the follow-up reveals. In both cases the people surveyed all
had full-time jobs, were randomly chosen and contacted directly, not through
their employer.
The number in the update was only 806 as against 3,275 in 1988, the reason
being not so much increased difficulty in finding full-time employees, as
the consultancy's wish to contain costs. One thing that may reflect the
nature of the recession, however, is that whereas nearly one in five of the
original 3,275 were managers with at least two levels of staff under them,
the same applied to only just over one in 10 of the latest group.
So what did the findings show about the attitudes of us still employed Brits
last November as compared with those of three years before?
The first example - that more of us are worried about our long-term
job-security - is less startling than that the anxious proportion has risen
only from 36 to 48 per cent. What does seem surprising is that despite our
increased worries about security, our morale is high.
One question put to the 806, though not asked in the rosy days of 1988, was
if their employers had coped well with recession. Over two thirds answered
yes, and almost as many thought their organisation well placed to take
advantage of an up-turn.
To back that air of confidence, questions asked in both surveys suggested
that organisational performance has improved. Nearly four in every five of
the latest group felt that overall quality of work and services was good, as
against three in five before. Employers were seen as tolerating sub-standard
workers by only 32 per cent compared with 41, and the proportion saying
quality had been reduced for the sake of cost-cutting was up by a mere 1 per
cent to 30.
The greater confidence in employing outfits was accompanied by a rise in
personal satisfaction with the job - up from 59 per cent to 66 in general
terms. The belief that payroll-cuts often produce welcome opportunities for
the survivors is supported by rises of much the same order in the shares
saying their jobs gave them a sense of achievement and a chance to use their
particular skills and abilities.
Accordingly, perhaps, 45 per cent felt their organisation was more than just
a place to work, compared with 38 three years earlier. Even more - 57 per
cent as against 45 - said they'd recommend other people to join it.
All of which would seem a feather in the cap of the heads of British
companies. To stay in business, the managers have imposed some stern
treatment on us in the managed majority, and those of us who have survived
it, at least, evidently tend to feel better as a result. Which in turn might
strike the managers as good reason to go on handing out the same medicine in
future, boom or bust.
If they do so, however, my suspicion is that they will make the same sort of
mistake as the one exemplified by now ludicrous-looking prophecy I made in
1989. It's the mistake of assuming that the forces which dominate in the
climate of the moment will continue to be dominant when it changes.
Other evidence from Wyatt's study suggests otherwise. The prime case in
point is that when the 806 were asked what they intended to do when the
economy improved, nearly a quarter said they'd find another job - close on
double the proportion who wanted out in 1988. What's more, while the most
footloose of the various types of worker were the manual sort, 22 per cent
of the managers planned to leave together with 23 per cent of the technical
specialists.
That finding endorses a lot of other research which shows that, while people
may make the best even of military discipline and often admire those who
impose it when there's no other choice, they never lose their aspirations to
be treated as free-born human beings. Nor do they fail to notice it when
they are being treated otherwise.
For instance, of Wyatt's 806, around three quarters declared that their boss
was not only technically proficient, but understood the work they themselves
did. By contrast, less than half thought their boss competent at dealing
with human problems and motivating staff.
Pay was another thing that, although they broadly felt it adequate in the
circumstances, they largely didn't find motivating. Not much more than a
quarter considered that how much staff got really reflected the contribution
they made, and under a third said they had been helped to improve their work
by performance-appraisal schemes.
What's more, they were not much encouraged by the promotion prospects in
their present company. Of all types of staff, just 33 per cent were
satisfied with the openings on hand. Of the technical specialists whose
skills are often crucial, only 23 per cent were content.
Since a lot of research has shown that good prospects for promotion tend to
be decisive in retaining people against jobs-market competition, that
finding looks ominous for employers once demand revives. For something that
has not changed since 1989 is the decline in the number of young people
available for recruitment.
So if Britain stages an economic recovery, my rosy forecast might eventually
prove right. In which case, given that I'm still around, I'll be tempted to
brandish the same words again, proudly for a change.
One damper on my hopes of getting the chance, however, is the 806's answers
to Wyatt's questions about the approach of the single European market. Only
about a third thought their organisation would benefit from the change, and
fewer than two in every five said their employers were making any
preparations for it at all.

FT  08 APR 92 / Labour would forward sex-equality issues in EC
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LABOUR would seek to put sex-equality issues at the top of the social and
employment agenda for the UK's six-month presidency of the European
Commission, which starts in July, Mr Tony Blair, employment spokesman, said
yesterday, Diane Summers writes.
Labour is committed to reversing the government's 'opt-out' from EC
employment legislation.
The party is also committed to introducing a Sex Equality Act, which would
combine sex discrimination and equal pay laws, and would introduce a right
to equal treatment.
The new law would require employers to prove that they were not
discriminating in equality cases before industrial tribunals, reversing the
current burden of proof.
Labour proposes to give part-time workers the same employment rights and the
same pay as full-time workers. Part-time workers currently enjoy employment
protection rights after five years, compared with two years for full-time
workers, and get reduced pension, redundancy and maternity benefits.

FT  08 APR 92 / UK impact on EC social policy 'limited'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN'S attempt to impose Thatcherite employment policies on the European
Community in 1986 was never expected to achieve more than short-term
political success and the government knew that the Brussels bureaucracy
would block it, according to an independent research body.
The unpublished assessment of the impact on EC social policy of the UK's
presidency of the Community in 1986 implies that its action programme for
employment growth created a backlash and led indirectly to the European
Social Charter, which the Conservative government has opposed.
The report was written by the National Institute for Economic and Social
Research for the Department of Employment. The UK is due to assume the
presidency of the Community again in July this year.
The case was seen as a textbook example of how the European Commission
neutralises proposals it opposes.
UK-style flexibility and deregulation of the labour market, was hailed by Mr
Kenneth Clarke, then paymaster-general and now education secretary, as 'a
milestone in tackling the problem of Europe's 16m jobless'. Eighteen months
after its adoption it was virtually forgotten, according to the assessment.
The UK programme was a short-term political success because all EC
social-affairs ministers were seen to back UK domestic policy, the institute
says.
The initiative by the government put unemployment high on the EC agenda and
showed a workable alternative to the European Commission's approach.
Yet the programme did not achieve its aim of changing the course of EC
social policy. Department of Employment officials failed to lobby hard for
Commission action after the programme was adopted. They knew any attempt to
oppose Commission policies would fail, the report concludes.

FT  08 APR 92 / Accounting salaries lose ground
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GRADUATE starting salaries in accountancy are falling increasingly behind
those in other professions, while the pay of newly qualified chartered
accountants actually declined last year, according to a survey of London
firms released yesterday.
The median salary of an accountancy student in inner London was up 3.4 per
cent at Pounds 11,200 in 1991, compared with a rise of 8.7 per cent to
Pounds 12,500 for a typical graduate recruit throughout industry and
commerce, according to the annual survey by Casis, the recruitment arm of
the London Society of Chartered Accountants.
The median salary of newly qualified accountants fell by 13 per cent to
Pounds 20,000 for small firms in inner London, and was flat at Pounds 22,000
for medium-size firms. It rose by 0.4 per cent to Pounds 22,600 among larger
firms.
Firms projected a 3.4 per cent increase in starting salaries for 1992 among
accountancy firms, compared with an average increase in graduate salaries of
4 per cent across all employers. All but 2 per cent of new recruits to the
accountancy firms are graduates.
The vast majority of firms based increases in student salaries on market
rates. Just over half offer three weeks annual holiday.

FT  08 APR 92 / Nissan will invest Pounds 20m in car R&amp;D
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NISSAN, the Japanese carmaker, is to invest Pounds 20m to expand its vehicle
design and development facilities in the UK, the company announced
yesterday. That will bring its total investment in design and development
operations in Europe to Pounds 64m.
Mr Yutaka Kume, Nissan's president, said the company also hoped to expand
production capacity in the UK to 400,000 cars a year by the end of the
1990s.
Officially Nissan has disclosed plans to date only for raising UK car
capacity to 300,000 a year by 1993.
Mr Kume said the company hoped to raise capacity to 400,000 a year without a
third model range. It is investing more than Pounds 900m at its Sunderland
car plant, where production begins this summer of the Micra small car in
addition to the existing Primera.
Nissan, the leading Japanese vehicle maker in Europe, is moving fast to
expand its European operations to stay ahead of its domestic rivals, chiefly
Toyota, the biggest Japanese carmaker, which starts car production in the UK
this year.
Mr Kume said the company was increasing investment at the Nissan European
Technology Centre at Cranfield, Bedfordshire, to Pounds 46m. The first stage
of the operation was officially opened yesterday.
In total, Nissan is investing Pounds 64m in its European design and
development operations, with Pounds 5m spent at Sunderland on a vehicle
proving ground and Pounds 13m invested at NETC Brussels.
NETC now employs 360 people in the UK. That will rise to 385 by next year.
Mr Kume said the expansion at Cranfield would allow vehicle prototype
development and assembly work to be moved from Japan to the UK. Engines and
chassis component assembly and testing would also move to the UK.
The NETC will be able to build and test prototype vehicles for Europe and to
test and refine engines for European-built vehicles.
Controversially, Mr Kume claimed that Nissan had become 'a fully integrated
European manufacturer designing, producing and selling vehicles in Europe
for European customers'. Nissan now has design and development centres in
the US and in Europe as well as the main facilities in Japan.
The expansion at Cranfield includes a road simulator and full climatic test
chamber with vehicle endurance testing. It is also building a soundproof
chamber for dynamic testing of vehicles at speeds up to 155 mph.

FT  08 APR 92 / Hutchison revives telepoint service
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TELEPOINT, the mobile communication system that appeared to have ended with
the termination of BT's Phonepoint service last October, was revived
yesterday with an announcement from Hutchison Personal Communications.
HPC, a division of Hutchison Telecommunications UK, the subsidiary of
Hutchison Whampoa, the Hong Kong-based multinational group, said it would
launch its telepoint network, called Rabbit, from June 29.
The announcement raises hopes for telepoint, which seemed to have been a
failure when BT withdrew its service, apparently because it had too few
subscribers.
Telepoint was launched in 1989 as a portable telephone service that was
lighter, cheaper and more reliable than cellular phones. The system is based
on a network of base stations installed in public places. Subscribers can
make calls from within 100m of a base station.
Poor marketing and lack of base stations resulted in low subscription
levels. When BT's service closed there were only 3,300 base stations and
about 800 customers.
After the closure of BT's service and the earlier closure of Mercury's
similar service, HPC is the only one of four groups licensed by the
government to provide telepoint ser-vices which isdoing so. The fourth
service was called Zonephone.
HPC plans to have more than 12,000 base stations operational by October and
expects the cost to users to be about a third to half the cost of using a
cellular phone.
Hutchison's telepoint network is based on an international standard that
will allow subscribers to use their handsets in Hong Kong and Singapore, in
each of which it has more than 15,000 subscribers, and in regions where the
standard may come into use in future.

To the east are Nottinghamshire's 12 remaining pits and the headquarters of
the union that sealed the fate of Britain's last great union battle. The
stance taken by the Union of Democratic Mineworkers, which broke away from
the National Union of Mineworkers in defiance of Mr Arthur Scargill's
strike-call in 1984, caused bitter divisions in the mining communities.
Eight years on, a much slimmer industry is fighting for its future.
The mining card should help ensure that Labour extends its tiny majority in
Mansfield and could bring it success in neighbouring Sherwood, a seat that
covers a cluster of mining villages north of Nottingham.
Almost everyone in the Sherwood villages, it seems, is a miner or former
miner. Every broad hand holds a record of social history among the faded
callouses.
In many parts of this Tory marginal, however, candidates are just as likely
to find that the strong handshake is that of a farmer. The rich coal seams
underground give way to the ploughshare on the surface in an agricultural
landscape dotted with modern pitheads.
Mr Andy Stewart, the popular sitting Tory MP and a local farmer, put in some
astute groundwork in touring the pits earlier this year. He faced tough
questioning from mineworkers and managers, worried that imported coal or
gas-fired power stations, or both, would kill what was left of their
industry.
He earned much respect, but whether he earned their votes is another
question. 'Some miners must have voted Conservative at the last election,
but it's difficult working out who they were,' says Mr Peter Short, the UDM
branch secretary at Bilsthorpe colliery and a Labour party worker.
Over at Rainworth Miners' Welfare Club, Mr Brian Vout, UDM secretary at
nearby Rufford pit, agrees, but blames Labour's failure to recognise the UDM
for many of the party's lost votes in north Nottinghamshire at the 1987
general election.
Two of the UDM's four full-time officials, Mr Neil Greatrex and Mr Mick
Stephens, are committed Labour supporters. Mr Greatrex says he has a promise
from Mr Frank Dobson, Labour's energy spokesman, that a Labour government
would not restrict the union's rights to represent miners.
Dissatisfaction with Labour remains, but it is difficult to gauge its depth.
Mr Vout applauds Mr Stewart's pit visits and criticises the failure of Mr
Paddy Tipping, the Labour candidate, to do the same at Rufford. 'I haven't
seen Tipping here,' he says. 'I always vote Labour, of course, but I would
appreciate listening to what the man has to say.'
Conversation with miners inevitably drifts towards the price of coal and the
willingness of the electricity generating industry to use it.
Mr Stewart has rehearsed his election spiel, celebrating the rejection of a
coal import terminal at Immingham on the River Humber and pointing to recent
pronouncements by Mr John Wakeham, the energy secretary, that gas should not
be used for electricity generation where it is more expensive than coal.
Mr Stewart points out that only 6,500 of his constituents work in the mines.
Some 8,000 others are retired miners with different problems that he argues
would be better served by a Conservative government.
But the Labour tradition runs deep, supporting the belief that Mr Stewart's
increased majority in 1987 was due to resentment towards Labour in the
aftermath of the strike.
Life without mining became a reality for Mr Tony Calladine, who left
Bilsthorpe because of ill-health just after the 1985 strike. He set up a
business restoring and servicing veteran motorcycles. It has branched out in
to polishing and chroming car engines displayed at motor shows.
Eight years of enterprise culture have not changed his voting patterns,
however. 'I have always voted Labour. I just think they are a better party.'
Come polling day, the closet Tories may re-emerge.
Mr Stewart knows he commands a healthy personal vote, but in the end it may
not be enough.

FT  08 APR 92 / Election '92: Lilley hears a few home truths
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES LEADBEATER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN LLOYD, managing director of Betterware, one of Britain's fastest
growing companies, was in full flow.
Statistics on every detail of the meteoric rise of the Sutton Coldfield
group, which sells home products door-to-door, flowed over a quietly
admiring Mr Peter Lilley, the trade and industry secretary. It was an ideal
example for the Tory case for a free-market, low-taxation,
non-interventionist industrial strategy.
Mr Lloyd and a team of managers bought the then ailing Betterware, for
Pounds 250,000 in 1985, and transformed it into a business with a market
capitalisation of more than Pounds 100m.
This was the kind of inspirational success story Mr Lilley needed to hear as
he went forth to warn business of the grave risks of turning their backs on
Conservative policies to lift burdens from business, cut taxes to motivate
managers and crush union power.
So, what would be the best thing the next government could do for a business
such as Betterware, someone asked.
Mr Lloyd shot back: 'Bring in higher capital allowances to help us with
investment.'
Mr Lilley was silent. Mr Lloyd had endorsed Labour's main policy to help
industry.
It was a similar story wherever Mr Lilley went that day. Business leaders
displayed unswerving support for the Conservatives as the party of
enterprise. But on specific measures to combat the recession they invariably
found merit in Labour's approach.
At IPW, a manufacturer of heat-treatment equipment next door to Betterware,
the managing director told Mr Lilley it was prospering by getting into
specialist markets.
But the sales director remarked: 'The most important thing a new government
could do is to deal with the short termism of the banks.'
Over afternoon tea with a group of Tory business supporters Mr Lilley got
off to a good start. Yet after accepting some open invitations to attack
Labour links with the unions and its tax plans the going got tougher.
Mr David Smith, who provides small businesses with advertising services,
said: 'There is a terribly jittery feeling, whenever the phone rings, that
it is someone else going down the tube.'
Mr Lilley's reply was limp. There were no policy responses, just a
recitation of the statistic that a lot of businesses were being created in
spite of the recession.
A builder chipped in: 'The problem is that asset values have fallen so banks
will not accept property as collateral for businesses. The banking system
has a stranglehold on investment. The government had to find a way of
opening up funds for investment.' The proposal fell on stony ground.
Mr Charles McEwan, a Conservative district councillor, recommended the
government steal some of Labour's clothes by allowing councils to use
receipts from council-house sales to start a building programme to stimulate
the construction sector.
As Mr Lilley sped off to an evening business forum, his tour was yielding an
inescapable conclusion: business executives instinctively trust the Tories
and want a Tory government for their personal pockets. But in the short term
they recognise, perhaps unwillingly, that Labour's policies could bring more
benefits to their companies.

THE FAMILY of Ferdinand Marcos, the late Philippine dictator, has informed
the government of plans for the return of his body next Sunday from Hawaii
where he had died in exile.
Marcos lawyers told President Corazon Aquino's office that the family plans
to fly the body by chartered aircraft directly to Laoag City in Ilocos
Norte, Mr Marcos's home province, where it will lie in state at his
ancestral home in Batac town for a traditional nine-day wake. The burial has
been set for April 21 in Paoay, Ilocos Norte.
The move fulfils a condition set by the Aquino government that the family
submit burial plans for approval before the homecoming.
Last week Manila asked the US government to bar the loading of Mr Marcos's
remains unless the coffin bears the Philippine consular seal in Hawaii.

FT  08 APR 92 / Immigrants cast their spell over Israeli election: Jewish
immigrants from Russia could tip the balance in favour of Labour
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR 30 months, Jewish immigrants from the former Soviet Union have seeped
into every corner of Israeli life: in the supermarkets, in the schools, in
the workplace, even busking on street corners, they are everywhere in
evidence.
Russian is the most widely heard language after Hebrew and Arabic. There are
daily broadcasts in Russian, and cyrillic subtitles are common on
television. Yet the political voice of the olim (literally, ascendants) has
been muted. That may be about to change.
In the general election on June 23, the way the immigrants vote could have a
dramatic impact on the outcome of the poll. Such are their numbers in a
small electorate, that if they tend heavily to favour one party over
another, they could decide whether the Likud party of Mr Yitzhak Shamir, the
incumbent prime minister, or the opposition Labour party leads the next
government.
A survey published this week suggested such a trend was developing for
Labour. The latest in a series carried out by Jerusalem's Tazpit Research
Institute showed support among Russian immigrants for Labour and its
potential coalition allies rising to 43 per cent, compared with 27 per cent
for the Likud and its right-wing allies.
The result was a remarkable turnround from the position in April 1991, when
the right scored 46 per cent and the left 21 per cent.
With 2 1/2 months still to go until polling day - and 29 per cent of the
olim remaining undecided, according to the poll - it is important not read
too much into the Tazpit findings. But it has underlined the importance of
the immigrant vote to Labour's bid, under Mr Yitzhak Rabin, its new leader,
to replace Mr Shamir's hardline government with an administration committed
to territorial compromise in the current Middle East peace negotiations.
Since September 1989, some 360,000 immigrants have arrived from territories
now in the Commonwealth of Independent States. Some 240,000 of them will be
eligible to vote, out of a total electorate of something over 3m. Mr Aharon
Fein, director of Tazpit, reckons about 180,000 of the eligible newcomers
will actually vote.
Under Israel's system of proportional representation, that number would
account for about eight seats in the 120-seat Knesset in which Labour
trailed Likud in the 1988 election by just one seat.
What is striking about the apparent swing to Labour is that it confounds the
past tendency of Soviet immigrants to spurn the party because of its
socialist background and favour the tough stance of the Likud in refusing to
make territorial compromises with the Palestinians. The chief reason for the
switch is a profound dissatisfaction with the economic record of Mr Shamir's
government.
Almost one in every two immigrants of working age is without a job. There is
great resentment against the high price of housing, and the government's
insistence on building a large proportion of new housing in peripheral areas
where jobs are scarcest and few olim want to settle.
'The majority have a tendency towards the right. But because the government
has done such a poor job on absorption many are now inclined against the
Likud,' says Mr Ephraim Meidan, a Soviet immigrant in the 1970s who now
lectures to olim on Israeli politics. 'A vote against the government will be
a protest against Likud, not a positive vote for Labour.'
But Mr Fein thinks there are other factors at work. He says many Russian
olim feel a greater ethnic empathy with Labour, the traditional party of
Russian and east European 'Ashkenazi' Zionists, than with the Likud which
has big support among the 'Sephardi' communities originally mainly from
North Africa and Middle eastern countries.
He also says the largely non-religious Russians perceive the Likud to be
more influenced by religious parties, whose heavy involvement in the
bureaucratic absorption process has upset many of them. On top of these
issues, says Mr Fein, the immigrants have learned that Labour's socialism is
a good deal less rigid than in the past.
The main ideological divide between Labour and Likud, over what to do about
the occupied territories, appears not to be the decisive factor in how the
immigrants will vote.
Instead, many olim accuse both Labour and Likud of paying only lip service
to absorption. As a result, a number of exclusive olim parties have emerged,
notably a group called Da, which wants to force the main parties to adopt
its prescriptions for employment and housing.
'It's not that we are uninterested in the issue of territory,' says Mrs
Faina Selmitska, a Da activist in Jerusalem. 'But immigrants think that the
traditional parties are uninterested in their concerns. Of course peace is
important. But it won't be coming soon, so for us the big issues are
economic.' Da leaders think the party could win up to three Knesset seats.
Ms Ida Nudel, a former Prisoner of Zion detained by the Soviet regime, says
until now Russian olim were nervous of expressing political views. 'But we
are learning a lot and we discover that Israeli society is like any society
and has a lot of problems. And because we are a big entity in that society
we should fight for our place without self-restraint.'

FT  08 APR 92 / Japanese island turns recession on its head: A land enriched
by recent car and electronics industry investment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVEN BUTLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE JAPANESE economy may be sliding into recession, but you would hardly
know it on Kyushu.
Kyushu is the country's southernmost main island. It is about the size of
the Netherlands and accounts for about 10 per cent of the national economy.
It is also soaring on the back of an investment boom, even as capital
spending in the rest of the country is plunging.
Nissan Motor this month turns the switch on a new assembly plant on the
northern tip of the island. Toyota, Japan's biggest car maker, has begun
construction of a new assembly facility a few miles inland. Following them
are dozens of companies that make car parts and components.
Investment in the island's transport industry, including cars and
shipbuilding, nearly trebled in 1990, was up by 80 per cent in 1991 and is
expected to rise by 56 per cent in 1992 to Y118.3bn (Pounds 512m). With
automotive investment following an investment surge by semiconductor
manufacturers in the past decade, the island is dotted with some of the
world's most technologically sophisticated industrial facilities.
Meanwhile, factory output nationally is being slashed and overtime cut.
Corporate profits are falling fast, and the stock market languishing at
five-year lows. While a Japanese recession looks nothing like its western
counterpart (there are no armies of homeless and unemployed or boarded-up
shops), in the industrial heartland areas around Tokyo and Osaka property
prices are plunging and bankruptcies increasing.
In contrast to predictions for the whole of Japan of a 9.6 per cent rise in
capital investment (excluding electricity) for the fiscal year which ended
last week, investment in Kyushu is going up in double digits - at 15.1 per
cent. That is expected to drop next year to only a 0.4 per cent gain, but
this is against a national decline of 1.3 per cent. In manufacturing, Kyushu
is still expected to move ahead by 6.2 per cent, compared to an expected
national decline of 6.1 per cent.
It was not always thus. The economy of Kyushu used to be like the rear tyres
of a jumbo jet, says Mr Takeshi Okuma, research and planning manager at the
Japan Development Bank's Fukuoka office: the last to take off when the
economy got going and first to hit ground when recession came.
These days, however, Kyushu is looking more and more like a perpetual flying
machine. 'The business trends do not affect us so deeply in Kyushu,' says Mr
Okuma, with gentle understatement.
This seems all the more surprising because the recent prosperity in Kyushu
is founded on the two manufacturing industries hit hardest by the slowdown
in the economy: cars and electronics.
The transformation of the Kyushu economy took place in the last decade
following a steady stream of investment from the electronics industry into
high-technology semiconductor fabrication and assembly facilities.
Manufacturers were attracted by land prices at just 20 per cent of those in
the Kanto region surrounding Tokyo. Companies could also save about 10 per
cent on labour costs, and found a generally high quality workforce that was
easier to recruit.
From 1981 to 1986, semiconductor output grew by 30.3 per cent a year, and
although growth tailed off to 6.6 per cent afterwards, Kyushu now accounts
for about 40 per cent of semiconductors made in Japan, worth Y890bn in 1990.
This includes some of the highest technology products, such as the
four-megabit dynamic random access memory chips made by NEC in Kumamoto. The
list of companies with semiconductor plants in Kyushu reads like a Who's Who
of the electronics industry, including Toshiba, Fujitsu, Mitsubishi, Sony,
Matsushita as well as Texas Instruments of the US.
Semiconductor output this year has been hit by a worldwide drop in the
computer and electronics industries, but while overtime may be cut, workers
are not being laid off. Mr Hiroto Nabeta, product engineering manager at
Texas Instrument's factory in Oita prefecture, says monthly unit output is
about 30 per cent below the factory's record one month output.
Staff, however, have been redeployed to product development teams, including
12 joint projects with automotive companies for application-specific chips.
In Kagoshima prefecture, NEC has recently started construction of a Y50bn
facility to manufacture colour liquid crystal display panels.
All of this development has gradually changed the quality of life in Kyushu,
part of which was once something of an agricultural outback. Indeed one of
the sources of growth this year has been a proliferation of leisure
facilities, including a sports dome in Fukuoka and a theme park that looks
for all the world like a Dutch city on a canal.
When Nissan and Toyota advertised internally to recruit production managers
to staff their new facilities they found the positions vastly
oversubscribed. Most of the applicants were Kyushu natives who decided it
was time to return home, where it is still possible for an ordinary salaried
employee to afford a house.
Japan's economic slowdown will in the end have some impact in Kyushu, as
demand growth throughout the economy contracts. Yet the speculative bubble
never hit hard in the island and any downturn should pass quickly, since
Kyushu will not have to cope with asset deflation.

<TEXT>
A CHANTING mob yesterday blocked a motorcade in Tripoli carrying a United
Nations envoy sent to explain a UN resolution imposing sanctions against
Libya over its refusal to yield two men suspected of the 1988 bombing of a
US airliner.
Mr Vladimir Petrovsky, the UN undersecretary general for political affairs,
was later assailed in his hotel by the demonstrators, who were dispersed by
riot police firing tear gas.
The Tripoli demonstrations hardly augured well for renewed attempts by Arab
League foreign ministers in Cairo last night to find a compromise to Libya's
increasingly bitter dispute with the world community.
The special committee of seven ministers from Egypt, Algeria, Tunisia,
Syria, Libya, Mauritania and Morocco was formed several weeks ago to defuse
the Libyan crisis, but it has been ineffectual.
Mr Amr Moussa, Egypt's foreign minister, told reporters after a morning's
informal talks on the Libyan affair there were 'many proposals' on the
table, but he would not go into details. Privately League officials are
pessimistic about their latest mediation efforts.
'The aim of the committee is to contain the situation, confirm the Arab
position opposing terrorism, solve the problem in the framework of
international sovereignty and provide a solution which all parties will
agree to,' Mr Moussa added.
One proposal is for Libya to hand over the two men to the Arab League which
would act as a conduit for their eventual surrender to the British or US
authorities for trial. Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, UN secretary general, would
also be involved in facilitating such a transfer.
But in Tripoli at the weekend, Libya's Colonel Muammer Gadaffi was adamant
that unless the men voluntarily gave themselves up, he would not hand them
over. Libya would never surrender its 'sons', he declared.
Security Council Resolution 748, agreed last week, imposes an air and arms
embargo against Libya from April 15 if it continues to block attempts to
extradite its nationals suspected of downing Pan Am flight 103 over
Lockerbie in Scotland.
The Council is also demanding that Libya make available for questioning to
the French authorities four Libyans, including Col Gadaffi's brother-in-law,
in connection with the bombing of a French UTA aircraft over Niger with loss
of all 171 passengers and crew.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN ONE Nigerian newspaper recently hailed South Africa's world cup
cricketers as 'Champions for Africa', it became clear that decades of
hostility between two of the continent's regional powers had come to an end.
Tomorrow South African President F W de Klerk will begin a two-day official
visit to Nigeria, the first ever paid by a South African leader to the
country which has proved apartheid's staunchest opponent in Africa.
At the United Nations and within the Organisation of African Unity (OAU),
Nigeria long pushed for the total isolation of the Pretoria government. But
Nigerian President Ibrahim Babangida, the current chairman of the OAU, was
among the first African leaders to recognise - privately - the immense
changes taking place in South Africa.
For months, he is understood to have been keen to invite Mr de Klerk for a
visit. Last month's referendum in South Africa, in which whites finally
rejected apartheid, gave him the excuse he needed to set a date. Loud
protestations from the African National Congress, which insists sanctions be
maintained against Pretoria until a multiracial interim government is set
up, did not deter him.
The visit marks South Africa's final reconciliation with the rest of Africa,
from which it has been so long estranged. No African door can remain closed
to Mr de Klerk, now that Nigeria has welcomed him back. And South African
officials are hoping that the visit will pave the way for membership of the
OAU and the African Development Bank (though not before an interim
government is set up in South Africa).
It seems likely that Pretoria will soon establish a trade mission in
Nigeria, though full diplomatic relations may take longer to achieve. Much
will depend on the success of the visit, during which Gen Babangida will
host a state banquet for Mr de Klerk at Abuja, the new Nigerian capital.
Yesterday Nigeria's neighbour, the Ivory Coast, which maintained contact
with Pretoria throughout the sanctions period, agreed to establish full
diplomatic ties at ambassadorial level.
But Pretoria's keenness to establish good relations with the countries of
Africa - especially with Nigeria, the continent's most populous nation -
stems more from economic need than political will. Mr Pik Botha, foreign
minister, has a vision of the continent's four regional powers - Egypt,
Nigeria, South Africa, and Kenya  - dragging Africa out of the economic mire
by working together.
And bilaterally, Pretoria is obviously looking to Nigeria as an export
market. The heads of South Africa's three largest business organisations,
the South African Foreign Trade Organisation, the South African Chamber of
Business and the Afrikaanse Handelsinstituut, will accompany him on his
visit.
Trade officials are focusing on South African exports to Nigeria, especially
steel, industrial chemicals and transport equipment, with South African
companies also likely to be involved in projects to improve Nigeria's road
and rail infrastructure (possibly with the help of multilateral aid funds),
and mineral exploration.

FT  08 APR 92 / World Trade News: Politics of cost bedevil Hong Kong's new
airport - Why estimates have jumped 14% - and where the HKDollars 114bn will
come from
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON HOLBERTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE HONG Kong government published updated cost estimates last week for its
plan to bequeath a modern airport to the colony before British rule ends in
1997. In the space of a year the real cost rose 13.8 per cent, taking the
project, in March 1991 prices, to Dollars HK114bn (Pounds 8.5bn).
However, given the politics of the airport's conception and the scale of the
project, cost over-runs were inevitable. Beijing was dubious from the start
but it traded its consent for a larger say in Hong Kong's affairs before the
formal handover on July 1 1997.
That said, Beijing was - and is still  - concerned about the airport's cost.
The Hong Kong government knew the airport would cost more, but judged it
politic to say so after the UK and China agreed to proceed with the project
rather than as negotiations were going on or in their immediate aftermath.
The over-run has much to do with the optimistic assumptions of the Hong Kong
government about some of the 'core' projects which make up Asia's single
most ambitious urban infrastructure development plan.
The key problem is the plan to build a railway from the airport to the
central district of Victoria Island. This was estimated at first to cost
HKDollars 12bn; the new estimate is HKDollars 22bn.
To make the railway project financially viable, the government has ceded to
the Mass Transit Railway Corporation (MTRC) - the company which will build
and own the railway - an unprecedented 60 hectares of land adjacent to and
over the proposed underground line for profitable redevelopment.
The government has further had to undertake to invest, in March 1991 prices,
HKDollars 3bn in the MTRC and agree to stump up HKDollars 7bn of 'callable
equity' in the event of future difficulties.
These are deals the MTRC can rightly be proud of and they certainly
safeguard its financial security. Late last year the MTRC presented this
proposal to international bankers and the US credit rating agencies and won
plaudits. Standard and Poors, in confirming the MTRC's single-A long-term
rating and its A-1 short-term rating in late February, said the rating
affirmation encompassed a review of the railway project.
However, Beijing has expressed concern at the post-1997 blank check it
thinks the British administrators of Hong Kong want it to endorse. China's
approval is needed for the railway (and the airport) to proceed because of
the implicit government financial guarantees which extend beyond 1997.
The Hong Kong government's line is that Beijing needs educating in the
realities of international construction and finance: 'This is not a World
Bank-funded project of the sort they are used to,' said one official.
Officials believe the government will receive at least a qualified yes from
the Chinese to proceed with the railway. They say the railway can open up to
18 months after the airport before congestion becomes serious.
No such problems with Beijing are expected over the airport itself (because
they regard it as financially sound), the 330 hectares west Kowloon
reclamation and the cross-harbour tunnel planned to connect west Kowloon
with the central district of Hong Kong.
Meanwhile, work is proceeding apace to level Chek Lap Kok, the small island
to the north of Lantau Island, which will form the platform for the runways,
terminal and associated services.
What Hong Kong officials can be less certain of is successfully negotiating
the rocky waters of contract conferral. Deep in the conspiratorial Chinese
mind there has always lurked the thought that the airport and its related
projects is Britain's way of repatriating Hong Kong's riches to the metropol
by way of large construction contracts.
When the Provisional Airport Authority announced that Sir Norman Foster and
others had won the HKDollars 536m for the design of the airport terminal a
howl of protest went up when it was discovered that Sir Norman's bid was the
highest of the three short-listed candidates.
Of the 38 contracts so far let, UK companies have figured in 80 per cent.
Most have been small, but the crunch will come when the contracts are
awarded for the Tsing Ma bridge, which will connect Lantau with Kowloon, the
Western Harbour crossing, and the site preparation contract for Chek Lap Kok
itself, due to be awarded in May.
Most bidders have been careful to include among their consortia at least one
mainland Chinese company - a modern east-Asian equivalent of buying Papal
indulgences.
The Hong Kong government has decided to finance the construction of the
Lantau fixed crossing internally and will select the consortium to construct
the Tsing Ma Bridge on its technical capabilities.
Government officials said yesterday external finance had never been a
pre-requisite for the Lantau crossing. Bidders for the contract had been

government's own source of finance.
Officials said the government would look to offer a long-term franchise to
operate the bridge, possibly in three to four years. By then contracts for
future ports development - including the terminal 10 container port - may
have been awarded, thereby securing the level of traffic needed to make the
bridge a commercial venture.

FT  08 APR 92 / World Trade News: Protectionism 'will hit EC most'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
THE European Community, and Germany in particular, stand to lose most if the
Uruguay Round under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt) fails,
according to the BDI, Germany's leading industry association. Economic and
political reforms in eastern Europe would also be threatened, and the danger
of mass migration to the west would be increased.
A drift back into protectionism could be 'devastating,' according to Mr
Heinrich Weiss, association president.
Condemning the EC's 'inefficient and unfair' common agricultural policy and
special protection afforded farmers, Mr Weiss demanded determined reform.
Concern over prospects for the talks has risen in Germany, where room for
political manoeuvre is limited by Bonn's long-standing special relationship
with France, the main opponent of agricultural concessions demanded chiefly
by the US.
It was paradoxical that farming, which contributed just 3.5 per cent of net
value added in the Community and 2 per cent in Germany, should be a
stumbling block, Mr Weiss said in a report just published.
Germany derived 32 per cent of national income from exports, compared with
11 per cent in Japan and 10 per cent in the US. More than 60 per cent of
mechanical engineering jobs were export-related, 51 per cent in the motor
industry, 57 per cent in chemicals and 46 per cent in electrical
engineering, the report said.
The Community, accounting for 40 per cent of world trade, was the world's
biggest export region, even after allowing for intra-member dealings and
would therefore be hardest hit by any relapse into protectionism.
The results would include:
Higher producer and consumer prices. Current estimates put the cost of
protection against imports at between 2 per cent and 3 per cent of gross
domestic product, the report claimed. Projected through the EC as a whole,
this would amount to Dollars 140bn (Pounds 80bn) annually.
Loss of employment. Some 44m people work for exports; a proportion of these
jobs would be put at risk.
Political conflict and instability, particularly between the the Community,
Japan and the US, the so-called triad.
Reuter adds from Bonn: The 24 members of the Organisation for Economic
Cooperation and Development must resolve to continue world trade talks and
prevent protectionism if the talks fail, Mr Jean-Claude Paye, OECD
secretary-general said.
He said it was imperative OECD members 'state very clearly their full
resolve to prevent any drift in the direction of protectionist measures.'
Portugal's plan for a special meeting of EC trade ministers to discuss world
trade talks has been shelved, the European Commission said, Reuter reports
from Brussels. Portuguese Prime Minister Anibal Cavaco Silva, whose country
holds the rotating presidency of the EC, had proposed the plan to analyse
prospects for Gatt talks before he and European Commission President Jacques
Delors visit Washington on April 22.

Poland is hoping that a final agreement with Fiat the Italian car maker, on
a joint venture with the FSM car factory can be signed later this month
after the Easter holiday, writes Christopher Bobinski in Warsaw.
Mr Andrzej Olechowski, finance minister, who led the Polish negotiating team
in a day of talks with Fiat on Monday, said later that 'notwithstanding
unforseeable events' a contract should be signed then.
Talks on the joint venture have dragged on for months over differences on
valuing the heavily indebted FSM plant which is now the sole producer of
Fiat's new Cinquecento model. The Polish government has offered to write off
the company's huge domestic debt but there is still a loan valued at in
excess of DM1bn (Pounds 352m) to be paid off arising from the Cinquencento
development originally agreed in 1987.
The Poles have been arguing that the 160,000 Cinquecento cars, to be
produced this year under an accord signed with the then communist
government, are losing FSM money. They have also urged Fiat to take on at
least part of FSM's foreign currency debt before taking a 51 per cent share
in the new company.

<TEXT>
The government of Singapore is to invest SDollars 1.4bn (Pounds 485m) in a
water development project on Indonesia's Bintan Island, Indonesia's official
Antara news agency said yesterday, writes William Keeling in Jakarta.
Antara quoted Mr Rivale Rachman, administration secretary of Riau province
and responsible for Bintan and Batam islands - which with Singapore and
Malaysia's Johor state make up the 'growth triangle' - that the agreement
had been signed between the two countries last month.
The agreement supplements a 30-year accord signed on June 20 last year,
Antara said, in which Indonesia agreed to supply Singapore 1bn gallons of
water a day at a price of one Singapore cent per cubic metre. The water is
to be piped from Bintan Island through Batam Island and across the sea to
Singapore. The project will be completed in three stages over 15 years.
Mr Rachman said 'the project will be fully financed by the Singapore
government and not by its private sector.' Batam has been attracting most
investment, USDollars 2.2bn in commitments by 1991, but adequate water
supply has been a major restriction to further development. A limit of 40
cubic metres per hectare a day has been imposed. However Bintam which has 14
rivers is the more abundant in water resources and the project will include
the construction of a reservoir.

<TEXT>
Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry (Miti) has established
a working group to examine a US decision to apply anti-trust laws against
foreign companies alleged to have unfairly blocked access for US exporters,
writes Robert Thomson in Tokyo.
The US decision on enforcement guidelines, viewed in Tokyo as a direct
result of frustration with Japan, has confused Japanese officials, unsure
whether the change is merely symbolic or will prompt a rush of actions
against Japanese companies.
'We have several officials who are now studying this change very closely. We
have heard that it is a symbolic change only and we have noted that this
change was made in a US election year, but we are not certain exactly what
will happen,' a senior Miti official said.
The US has strongly condemned Japanese enforcement of anti-monopoly laws,
and while the Fair Trade Commission (FTC) has become more vigilant over the
past two years, US companies still complain that exclusionary practices
remain common in Japan.
Under the new standard, the US justice department will be able to act
against a range of collusive practices by foreign companies in their home
markets, although court action would likely be taken against US subsidiaries
of those companies.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ARGENTINA and its international bank creditors yesterday secured an
important outline accord aimed at reducing the government's foreign debt
burden.
The agreement was achieved in all-night talks which finished at 5am
yesterday in Santo Domingo, where the Inter-American Development Bank is
holding its annual meeting.
Mr Domingo Cavallo, the Argentine finance minister, who led the negotiating
team, said he was sure the accord would represent 'a turning point in the
Argentine economy'.
It was described by Mr David Mulford, US Treasury under-secretary for
international affairs as 'one of the most important agreements achieved in
recent years'. He praised Mr Cavallo for 'vision and courage' and the banks
for a 'constructive and statesmanlike attitude' to the negotiations.
The outline accord took two months to reach, the fastest negotiation yet of
a debt reduction accord, said Mr William Rhodes, the Citicorp vice-chairman,
who headed the 13-bank negotiating team.
The Citicorp chief said it would allow Argentina greater access to the
international capital markets.
The agreement covered Dollars 23bn in medium-term debt owed to banks and
Dollars 8bn in arrears on interest.
Banks holding the medium-term debt may exchange it for:
30-year bonds at a discount to face value of 35 per cent, with interest at
London interbank offered rates plus  13/16 per cent, and carrying collateral
to guarantee 12 months of interest payments.
30-year bonds with the same face value as the debt, with interest rates
rising in steps from 4 per cent in year one to 6 per cent in years seven to
30. They have a 12-month interest guarantee.

FT  08 APR 92 / Portugal undaunted by challenge of race to catch up richer
EC nations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK BLUM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LISBON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE escudo's entry into the exchange rate mechanism of the European Monetary
System last weekend demonstrates the Portuguese government's unwavering
commitment to carry through fully its economic programme of convergence with
its richer EC partners, says Mr Jorge Braga de Macedo, finance minister.
'This is an example of what we are doing to favour economic rationalisation
by enterprises. To provide them with a clear environment where they can make
their decisions in the best possible way. This is why we are determined to
eradicate inflation,' he said in an interview.
He is undaunted by the challenges and risks that Portugal may face as it
seeks to catch up with its European partners, and rejects any suggestion
that the government's economic convergence programme could be
over-ambitious.
Curbing the public deficit, to around 3 per cent of GDP by 1997, is a key
component of convergence. The government aims to reduce the deficit from 6.5
per cent of GDP in 1991 to 5.2 per cent this year, despite a strong rise in
expenditure.
Increases in value added taxes which met widespread criticism were
inevitable because of the need to harmonise tax rates within the EC, he
says.
He admits current expenditure is 'too high' - some economists calculate it
has risen by 36 per cent in this year's budget. He says further efforts will
be needed to bring expenditure down, but insists this can be only be done
gradually through negotiations with public sector trade unions.
'We have a programme of gradual reduction of the number of employees, to
induce mobility and enhance productivity,' he says. This will help also to
release pressures and shortages in the labour market - the consequence of a
low 4 per cent unemployment rate.
Wages have been 'a serious constraint on public sector finances,' he says.
In this year's pay round, the government initially offered 6.5 per cent.
This was rejected by the unions and after a series of strikes and protests,
a 9.75 per cent deal was struck. The minister says real wages in the public
sector rose only 1.75 per cent, on the basis of an inflation forecast of 8
per cent.
Public sector wages are calculated on the basis of a forecast for inflation
with additional increases for productivity and for real incomes convergence.
The plan is to maintain this formula along with the government's inflation
targets of 4-6 per cent in 1993-95. Mr Braga de Macedo believes this can be
achieved. 'It was extremely difficult (to reach agreement). I think this
year was the toughest. It was necessary to break the wage inflation mold,
now it's a question of preserving the gains (achieved),' he says.
By seeking to win popular agreement for wage restraint, it was possible to
reduce inflation 'without tears,' he says.

FT  08 APR 92 / Swiss banks castigated for Omni 'carelessness'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SWITZERLAND'S Federal Banking Commission has castigated the 50 or so mostly
regional Swiss banks involved in lending to Omni Holding, the financial
empire of Mr Werner Rey, which collapsed a year ago.
In its annual report for 1991 published yesterday, the regulatory body says
the 'carelessness' with which some loans to Omni and Rey were granted was
not 'compatible with the diligence of a serious banker'.
The Commission notes that more than half of loans to Omni were made on an
unsecured basis, and many were granted without adequate documentation or
adherence to proper procedures.
At the end of 1990, lending to Omni amounted to SFr1.4bn, (Pounds 530m)
including Mr Rey's private debt to Swiss banks of SFr306m.
He filed for personal bankruptcy last September. Including debts to foreign
banks, Mr Rey and Omni owe more than SFr2bn, the Commission estimates.
The Commission says it believes the banks have learned their lesson from the
Omni collapse, Switzerland's biggest corporate failure. In six banks,
including Swiss Bank Corporation, the country's second largest bank, those
responsible have resigned or been dismissed, and proceedings are pending in
two others.
It is not yet clear how much creditors will recoup of their Omni loans, but
many small regional banks have been obliged to make big provisions for bad
debt.
This has added to financial pressures from the downturn in Switzerland's
property market, which led to failure of a small regional bank in Thun last
October.
The Banking Commission warns that the position of regional banks, which are
heavily dependent on property lending, could worsen further this year.

BRUSSELS will shortly call on Berlin to demand a substantial additional

from the city two years ago, a senior official said yesterday, writes Leslie
Colitt in Berlin.
An investigation was launched by the EC to determine whether Daimler-Benz
and Sony had received illegal subsidies from the city to buy real estate for
offices on Potsdamer Platz. The square was the heart of pre-war Berlin and
was bisected by the Wall.
The Commission told the Bonn government that Daimler-Benz would be asked to
pay nearly DM34m (Pounds 12m) in addition to the DM93m it originally paid.
Berlin sharply criticised the decision as likely to deter investors but said
it expected Daimler-Benz to pay.

FT  08 APR 92 / Yeltsin to ease economic shock therapy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Boris Yeltsin, the Russian President, yesterday appeared to have saved
both his government and its economic reforms from early destruction, at the
cost of further promises of assistance to the low paid, industries and
agriculture.
Both Mr Yeltsin and Mr Yegor Gaidar, the first deputy prime minister who
spoke briefly after the president, were received sceptically and largely in
silence. Only when Mr Yeltsin sought to blame some of the difficulties on
the previous Soviet governments of Mr Nikolai Ryzkov and Mr Valentin Pavlov
did the muttering in the audience rise by several disapproving decibels,
forcing him to stop to allow Mr Ruslan Khasbulatov, the speaker, to appeal
for silence.
Mr Yeltsin mentioned neither the promised liberalisation of energy prices
set for June, which he is believed to have doubts about, nor the assistance
promised by the International Monetary Fund and the Group of Seven
countries, which is unpopular with many of the deputies. He left both to the
staccato speech of Mr Gaidar, who said the Dollars 24bn (Pounds 13.9bn)
assistance promised last week was 'comparable to the Marshall Plan for
Europe after the war'.
Mr Yeltsin blamed the government for underestimating the extent of the price
rises and for the slow pace of privatisation. He said privatisation would
now be hastened, since Russia must 'create millions of owners of property
and not hundreds of millionaires'.
The president said the policy of the government required correction
especially in the area of social welfare. Further credits would be given to
industry and agriculture for investment and that further large grants would
be made to military enterprises for their conversion programmes.
Mr Gaidar accepted that the government had been wrong about the effects of
the price rises, but, like Mr Yeltsin, claimed the market economy was
beginning to work, and that 'unique pre-conditions for the economic recovery
of Russia have been created'.
'Russia has the chance to enter a period of economic growth . . . it would
be a crime to turn away from this road.' He said the government would now
change the emphasis of reform, moving away from shock therapy towards 'a
broad programme of transforming the economy'.
It now seems certain that the crisis in industry - where unpaid debts amount
to Rbs800bn - will receive more attention, together with the promised
Rbs200bn in credits.
Mr Vladimir Shumeiko, an ally of Mr Khasbulatov's and his deputy in charge
of economic reform, called for the creation of a 'powerful centre for the
administration of industry' and for a revamped industrial ministry. This
would represent the interests of state enterprises - which constitute 88 per
cent of output - in the heart of government. Mr Shumeiko may himself take
the post of industry minister in a further cabinet reshuffle.
He said Mr Yeltsin had already promised to amend the privatisation
legislation to allow managers to take between 10-20 per cent of the stock of
privatised companies.
Japan is likely to put up about Dollars 1bn (Pounds 570m) for a fund to help
Russia stabilise the rouble and will come up with an overall policy on a
western aid plan by the end of April, government officials said in Tokyo,
agencies report.
Meanwhile, Mr Jacques Attali, president of the European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development, said the Group of Seven's pledge of Dollars
24bn in aid to Russia is only half the amount really needed by the
Commonwealth of Independent States. The total consists of a Dollars 6bn fund
to stabilise the rouble and Dollars 18bn in balance of payments support. Mr
Attali said the aid package is only funds 'either already announced or in
the air'.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A NEW computer system linking the EC's national tax administrations should
be ready by November 2, to enable Community businesses to prepare for the
new single market regime for monitoring value added tax (VAT) on
cross-border sales, writes Andrew Hill in Brussels.
European Commission officials said yesterday they had signed contracts with
SOF-X Marben Group, a Franco-Belgian software company, which will work on
the system with NCR and Interpac. They would not reveal the value of the
contract, but the Commission will spend up to Ecu8.7m (Pounds 6.2m) this
year on development, on the hardware itself and on initial running of the
system.
From January 1, 1993, border VAT checks should disappear and the computer
system will replace some 60m forms, currently used for monitoring VAT
returns on cross-border trade. Under the transitional VAT regime,
cross-border sales will still be zero-rated for VAT provided the customer
and seller are registered, and the customer will pay VAT at local rates.
Each quarter, traders will have to provide their registration number and
those of their customers to their national tax authority, as well as the
value of sales made to each intra-Community customer. The computer system
will be used by member states to exchange information, and, from November,
traders themselves will be able to confirm the VAT status of their customers
via the computer. At the end of 1996, the EC should move to a definitive VAT
system, under which customers will pay the tax at the rates applicable in
the country from which they buy the goods. The decision to move to a final
system will require unanimous approval from the 12 member states.

FT  08 APR 92 / Investors switch into sterling
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SUPPORT from Japanese and UK institutional investors buoyed the pound
yesterday as financial markets began to take a more sanguine view of the
repercussions if there is a change in the British government.
Investors switched money into sterling on calculations that a Labour
administration or a hung parliament was unlikely to lead to large-scale
selling of the pound.
As a result, sterling gained half a pfennig in London to close at DM2.8425.
Government gilt-edged securities gained about half a point, while on the
London stock market the FT-SE 100 Index of leading shares rose 3.3 to
2,404.2, continuing Monday's steady performance after a 65-point fall last
week.
Over the past few days, markets have taken heart from repeated assertions
from Labour that it would keep sterling within its existing band in the
European exchange rate mechanism.
That has calmed investors, who last week worried that an incoming Labour
administration would trigger a run on the pound. In such an event, the new
government might be forced to increase interest rates, holding back faint
stirrings of economic recovery.
Yesterday's events indicate that many investors have come to terms with a
Labour-led coalition or a Labour victory after tomorrow's general election.
Mr Bill Simpson, an economist in Barclays Bank's foreign exchange division,
said the buying pressure for sterling was due to fund managers 'appreciating
that the room for further downward movement in sterling is limited and that
there is plenty of upside potential'.

FT  07 APR 92 / Link with private sector welcomed
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
LOCAL AUTHORITIES have come to see over the past decade that partnership
with the private sector is fundamental to the wellbeing of their areas, Mr
Jeremy Beecham, chairman of the Labour-controlled Association of
Metropolitan Authorities, said yesterday.
To fulfil their responsibilities to their areas, councils cannot be
indifferent to the needs of business, and business cannot thrive against a
background of decline and decay, Mr Beecham told members of the Tyne and
Wear Chamber of Commerce, Trade and Industry.
Through organisations such as Business in the Community, private-sector
leaders have become much more aware, he said, of the pressures on local
authorities and the constraints they face. Local authorities, he added,
needed perhaps to appreciate more the pressures on businesses and not always
to expect them to fill in 'gaps in the system'.

FT  07 APR 92 / Survey of The Computer Industry (10): User-friendly systems
 -Pen-Based Computing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE COMPUTER keyboard is widely accepted to be, at best, an awkward
interface between man and machine.
Apple's success with the Macintosh, Microsoft's with its Windows icon-based
operating environment, and the proliferation of pointing devices - such as
the mouse - all appear to reflect the desire for a more intuitive interface.
The best hopes for developing a truly 'natural' interface probably lie in
either voice activated or pen-based computing (or a combination of both). Of
the two, pen computing is more developed with a handful of commercial
products already in the market and predictions from some manufacturers and
industry analysts that it will be 'the next personal computer boom
business'.
Portable computers, including hand-held units, are expected to be the main
PC growth market through the middle of the 1990s and BIS Strategic
Decisions, the market research company, predicts the market for pen-based
computer systems will be worth Dollars 1.5bn by 1995.
Among the first full function machines to reach the market are those from
manufacturers such as Grid, part of Tandy's Victor Technologies unit, AT&amp;T's
NCR subsidiary, Californian start-up Momenta, and Fujitsu's Poqet Computer.
These pen-based machines come in several guises. Momenta's new machine,
built around Intel's 80386sx chip and developed with Dollars 40m of venture
capital, is a hybrid since it comes with a wired copper-tipped electronic
'pen' and a small keyboard which its manufacturer claims makes it ideal for
applications such as taking notes at meetings, business planning or for
editing and correcting reports. The machine runs industry standard MsDos,
Momenta's own operating software, Momenta Software Environment (MSE), and
Microsoft's PenWindows.
However, most pen computers do not have keyboards - although some, including
Grid's new Gridpad SL, have ports at the back for a plug-in keyboard and VGA
monitor. Usually, however, they make do with LCD screens with digitiser pads
underneath that enable the screen to double as an electronic tablet or
slate, and a plastic stylus or 'pen' for 'writing'.
The pen is used to write free text, using one or more of the pen operating
systems, complete electronic forms by filling in boxes, or indicate sections
of a diagram on the computer screen - for example, marking the position of
damage on car bodywork.
One advantage claimed for pen systems is that they are simple to use and
will enable even the most keyboard-illiterate, from the chief executive to
the humblest blue-collar worker, to exploit computer technology.
The simplest pen-based systems are intended for applications where a paper
copy is required but where a printer would be cumbersome or too expensive.
One example of such a machine is the ScriptWriter, produced by Peripheral
Vision of the UK, which can be used for taking down an order, and leaving a
hard copy with the customer.
Because they are relatively simple, these electronic clipboards are
considerably less expensive than their more sophisticated counterparts.
Other machines are primarily intended for vertical applications, where
customised software enables engineers, market researchers, nurses or
surveyors, for example, to gather data.
In this role, the pen operates as a kind of glorified mouse, pointing to
items on the screen to select them. The pen can also be used to tick boxes
and to draw with the result saved as an image for later retrieval.
For example, insurance company assessors are using one application on the
Gridpad pen computer to calculate the cost of motor accident repairs by
displaying expanded vehicle diagrams on the screen.
By touching individual components on the screen with the pen, the machine
records the parts that need replacing.
The more sophisticated applications for pen computers depend on the
handwriting recognition software which comes with most of the latest
machines.
Using this software, pen-based systems can recognise and interpret letters
or numbers. However, the ability to use a pen computer like the traditional
notebook and pen is still some way off.
This is because you have to 'train' the software to interpret the quirks of
individual writing styles and even then most software will fail to correctly
identify as much as 20 per cent of the text.
What is more, most typists, even the two-fingered variety, can write more
quickly with a keyboard.
For these and other reasons some critics argue that the advantages of pen
computing are being overstated. Stephen Arnold, chairman and founder of
Softa, a UK-based independent systems consultancy, says that pen computing
appears to be a solution looking for an application.

RABOBANK Nederland, the Dutch bank, has signed a co-operation agreement with
Cassa di Risparmio delle Provincie Lombarde (Cariplo), AP-DJ reports from
Utrecht.
Under the terms of the agreement, Rabobank customers will have access to
business banking services offered at over 600 Cariplo branches in Italy
while Cariplo customers can use Rabobank's Dutch network of over 2,000
offices.
Rabobank said that the agreement with Cariplo follows recent arrangements
made with Spain's Banco Popular Espanol, Credit Agricole of France, and
Lloyds Bank of the UK.
The latest agreement confirms Rabobank's policy of positioning itself in
Europe ahead of 1993. The bank said it is seeking to expand its own office
network in Europe, while forming alliances with foreign partners.
Rabobank is already active in Italy through its Milan representative office,
Rabofin Italia.
ACEC-UNION Miniere, the Belgian non-ferrous metals company, is unlikely to
see much of an improvement in its 1992 results after posting a loss in 1991,
according to Mr Jean-Pierre Rodier, the chief executive officer, Reuter
reports from Brussels.
Acec-UM, a subsidiary of Belgian holding company Societe Generale de
Belgique, earlier said it had a BFr5bn (Dollars 147m) group loss in 1991,
reversing a BFr3.82bn profit in 1990. It also dropped its 1991 dividend.
THE GERMAN insurer Aachener und Muenchener Versicherung, part of Aachener
und Muenchener Beteiligungs, the financial holding group, said it had
sharply reduced its 1991 underwriting losses to DM9m (Dollars 5.4m) from a
previous DM40.2m, Reuter reports from Aachen.
The company said that 1990 results had been held back by heavy claims linked
to hurricanes. It also said 1991 earnings from financial investments had
risen by about DM29m.
HENKEL, the German chemicals group, will take over hair care maker Henara
from Britain's European Brands Group on June 29 for an undisclosed sum,
Reuter reports from Dusseldorf.
Henkel said the acquisition would boost its annual cosmetics sales in
Britain to about DM60m, including Henara sales of about DM15m. Henara
produces shampoos, conditioners and home permanent kits.

FT  07 APR 92 / Brazil acts as influx of dollars threatens anti-inflation
policy

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Brazilian Central Bank is trying to slow the recent rush of dollars into
the economy, threatening the government's anti-inflationary policy.
An excess of dollars is an ironic problem for a country which just six
months ago had to suspend the gold operations of its central bank because
reserves had reached critical levels of Dollars 7bn, below which debt
payments are halted.
But in the past four months Brazil has had net inflows of Dollars 9bn. This
has been the result of an increase in export contracts and a flood of
foreign investment, attracted by cheap prices on the stock exchange and high
real interest rates, as well as increased confidence in the Brazilian
economy.
To stop this jeopardising the government's tight monetary policy, the
Treasury has had to soak up the extra liquidity by issuing bonds at interest
rates of 30 per cent a year, which has produced a staggering rise in
domestic public debt.
Between September and February this grew 87 per cent above inflation. This
compares to a 30 per cent growth in the whole of the government's preceding
22 months in office since President Fernando Collor's asset freeze in March
1990 which reduced treasury debt from Dollars 54bn to Dollars 5bn overnight.
The increase in domestic debt, coupled with falling tax revenues, has led to
fears that Brazil will fail to meet the fiscal targets set in its recent
accord with the International Monetary Fund but the Economy Ministry insists
the situation is under control.
Market estimates put current foreign exchange reserve levels at Dollars
15bn. Last week Mr Collor warned that the government must take care to
prevent reserves reaching Dollars 20bn too rapidly.
As a first step, the central bank has halved to 180 days the maximum period
of anticipation on foreign exchange contracts for exports to stop exporters
using the money for speculating in the financial markets to take advantage
of high interest rates.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
POWER cuts of at least eight hours a day have been imposed all over Colombia
in an effort to cope with a drought that has reduced the water for hydro
electric plants. There is little prospect of rain, and reservoirs are drying
into baked mud. If this continues the country could face a complete
black-out by the end of April.
The winter rains are late and the El Nino current off the Pacific coast
appears to be upsetting normal weather patterns. But bad planning, heavy
debts, corruption, budget deficits, deforestation and poor management are
behind the electricity problems.
Colombia's generating capacity is 8,200MW, more than adequate for normal
demand levels. Despite the country's ample coal and oil reserves, 78 per
cent of power comes from large, expensive hydro-electric schemes which have
pushed the sector's foreign debt up to more than Dollars 5bn.
To try to save on costs, electricity companies have been running down the
reservoirs rather than use thermal plants at full capacity. Labour and
financial problems have also delayed the maintenance of thermal power
stations, while guerrilla attacks have put distribution lines out of action.
The rationing aims to cut overall consumption by about a third. The
government has asked industry to shut down for 10 days over Easter and to
send workers on holiday.

FT  07 APR 92 / Christian revival perturbs Singapore: Religious morals may
conflict with political requirements
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTOR MALLET
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LAST thing one expects to see in the sober, disciplined city of
Singapore is a respectable middle-aged Chinese woman lying on her back in a
public place, moaning and twitching and saying: 'It was wonderful. I saw
many bright lights.'
In a country where even chewing-gum is forbidden, the only context in which
you are likely to witness such an event is a charismatic Christian church
service. The lady in question, a living testament to the rise of
fundamentalist Christianity in Singapore over the last decade, was attending
an Anglican service of hymns and healing, with electric guitar, in the
Victoria Concert Hall on a recent Sunday.
Leading the congregation was Bishop Chiu Ban-It, the former Bishop of
Singapore, taking a break from his retirement in the English county of
Dorset to cure the sick and see for himself the spread of Christianity since
the first stirrings of the 'renewal' in 1973.
He recalled the days when St Andrew's Cathedral had only three Sunday
services. 'I was bishop and we were pretty desperate,' he said. Now there
are nine services. 'It's just marvellous for me to come and see. The thing
which thrills me is the number of lay people and young people who are taking
responsibility.'
Bishop Chiu gave the same sermon on Christian values this year in Singapore
as he did when he preached to Queen Elizabeth at Windsor parish church in
1968. But this time he went on to offer the prospect of a cure for back
problems, especially those caused by one leg being shorter than the other,
and urged sufferers to come on stage to be healed. 'If we pray and ask the
Lord, He levels their legs up. In many cases it's permanent,' he told the
worshippers, who queued to be cured and as often as not keeled over while
the bishop prayed and held their hands.
The Singapore government, which regards the obedience of citizens to the
secular state as all-important, is considerably less thrilled than the
bishop by Christianity's progress. Only five years ago the authorities
arrested more than 20 people over a supposed Catholic-Communist conspiracy.
A fifth of the island's population are already Christians - roughly double
the number a decade ago - and anecdotal evidence suggests the religion
continues to spread among the young. There are influential Christians in the
bureaucracy, in politics and in business.
Anglican charismatics are among the more moderate of the new wave of
fundamentalists. Baptist and gospel fringe churches have taken over several
old cinemas to accommodate their growing congregations, and the services of
visiting foreign evangelists are packed night after night.
Most Christians are from the Chinese community, apparently because the
Chinese practice of ancestor-worship has a looser hold on its adherents than
Islam has on Malays, or Hinduism on Indians.
One Singaporean Chinese woman from a baptist church explained how she
angered her parents by becoming a Christian at the age of 12, before
converting her siblings and finally - last year - her ageing mother. The
trend has left some Chinese elders confused, and fearful of not seeing their
relatives in the afterlife, but others watch stoically as their children
hold prayer meetings in the house.
Like many newly-converted Chinese Christians, Mr Oscar Huang, a computer
software engineer from mainland China working in Singapore, is somewhat
iconoclastic, scorning his Buddhist parents' belief in idols. 'My parents
and grandparents ask the idols, the gods to help us, even the rice god,' he
said after a Mandarin-language Anglican hymn-singing session. 'I don't
believe that stuff. They can't help us.'
Ask a Christian why the faith is spreading, and he or she will probably
answer as Mr Lee Da-Win did after Bishop Chiu's service. 'The spirit is
moving mightily in Singapore,' he said. 'Many people in Singapore are very
open to the Lord.' The bishop himself says the success of Christianity is
partly a reaction to widespread materialism in modern Singapore.
Non-believers have another explanation; they link the rise of charismatic
Christianity to the soullessness of life in a country where overt
individualism and freedom of expression are often frowned upon as disruptive
by a government dedicated to 'consensus'.
At first glance, the stern moral outlook and the emphasis on family life of
the Christians appear to coincide with the views of the government (some
pastors like to fulminate against homosexuality, for example), but the
authorities remain fearful of any Christian moral imperative which might
conflict with their own view of the country's greater good. They are
suspected by some Christians of trying to curb the charismatic movement with
a long-drawn-out attempt to convict Mr Frederick Seaward of the Calvary
Charismatic Centre on fraud charges.
Singaporean officials are particularly wary of evangelism, whether by word
of mouth or by more modern methods such as the country's radio-paging
networks, because they do not want to upset Singaporean fundamentalist
Moslems or provoke an outcry from their predominantly Moslem and much larger
neighbours, Malaysia and Indonesia.
'No-one goes after the Moslems because they can't, what with the Indonesians
the the south and the Malays to the north,' says one believer. 'It always
ends up difficult for the Christians.' Illust. Police handcuff a Christian
demonstrator in Singapore in 1987. Authorities have since taken a less
active line against religious revivals, but remain worried by it

ISRAEL will not attend any of the multilateral Middle East peace talks due
to reconvene in May if they include representatives of the Palestinian
diaspora, Mr Yitzhak Shamir, the Israeli prime minister, said yesterday.
In a further declaration of the government's unyielding stance, Mr Ariel
Sharon, the housing minister, said he planned to step up building for Jews
in hitherto Arab areas of east Jerusalem captured by Israel during the 1967
Six Day War, including the Moslem Quarter of the Old City, where previous
Jewish settlement has provoked violent protest by Palestinians.
Mr Shamir said the inclusion of Palestinians from outside the occupied West
Bank and Gaza Strip contravened ground-rules established for the series of
bilateral and multilateral negotiations launched at the Madrid peace
conference last October.
The US and Russian co-sponsors of the talks have proposed including
Palestinian exiles in several multilateral committees due to begin
discussing issues such as refugees, water and arms control next month. But
Israel regards their inclusion as a step towards granting such exiles the
right to return to their original homeland.
'We will not accept it because it is a violation of all the rules that have
been agreed between us and the co-sponsors,' Mr Shamir said. He wants the
West Bank and Gazan Palestinians restricted to a joint delegation with
Jordan, as in the bilateral talks which resume in Washington later this
month.
Mr Sharon met Mr Teddy Kollek, the veteran mayor of Jerusalem, to outline
his plans for a string of Jewish settlements in Silwan, an Arab
neighbourhood just outside the Old City, the Mount of Olives, the Moslem
Quarter and the Arab area of Wadi Joz.
Mr Kollek opposes such intrusive settlement, which Palestinians regard as
intended to break up and marginalise their place in Jerusalem. But Mr Sharon
intends to override his objections.
The senior officer in charge of Israeli operations in Lebanon escaped injury
when two explosions targeted his convoy in southern Lebanon yesterday
killing one Israeli soldier and wounding four others, writes Lara Marlowe in
Beirut.
The pro-Iranian Shia Moslem Hizbollah movement in Beirut claimed the attack
was carried out by its allies in the 'Islamic Jihad of Palestine'.
The bombing appears to have been another attempt to avenge the February 16
assassination by the Israelis of Hizbollah leader Sheikh Abbas Musawi.

THE Romanian government has reaffirmed its commitment to facilitating direct
foreign participation in the country's economy.
A government statement issued yesterday stressed that foreign investors
would receive the same rights as Romanian nationals and that there would be
free access to markets throughout the economy.
The government aimed for minimum intervention in commercial activities and
its role would be 'almost exclusively supportive'.
At the same time, the government announced that in particular it would
encourage foreign participation in priority sectors, including agriculture,
energy, transport and telecommunications to speed up Romania's transition to
a market-led economy.
Foreign investors participating in priority sectors would be able to
negotiate on an individual basis for additional investment incentives,
according to the Romanian Development Agency (RDA), a state-funded body
responsible for alerting potential investors to opportunities in the
country.
In particular, foreign participants could negotiate for additional tax
relief and customs duty reduction.
Foreign participation was a key factor in restructuring he Romanian economy
and the government needed to stimulate further interest.
So far, the level of foreign interest had been disappointing, the RDA said.
In the two years to March 1991, foreign investment in Romania totalled
approximately Pounds 188m of which 60 per cent had come from western Europe.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BELGIAN newspapers are calling Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene the 'TGV'. In their eyes,
Mr Dehaene, who took over as Belgium's prime minister only a month ago, is
an express train pulling Belgium's political slowcoaches behind him.
On Sunday, Mr Dehaene proved that he had both speed and weight, by
announcing, after just three days of formal discussion, a programme of
swingeing budget control measures aimed at putting Belgium on track for
economic and monetary union with its EC partners.
The package should produce savings and extra tax revenues of some BFr75bn
(Dollars 2.2bn), to add to the benefits of VAT restructuring and internal
savings on civil service expenditure, which have already been announced.
Belgium has to cut its budget deficit from 6.3 per cent of gross national
product in 1991, to 3 per cent by the end of 1996. Mr Dehaene reckons these
measures will help reduce the deficit to 5 per cent by the end of this year.
Some economists believe he is calculating Belgium's progress using slightly
more relaxed criteria than his EC partners would allow, but the speed with
which Mr Dehaene has acted is still impressive.
'Very un-Belgian,' said Mr Gary Smith, European economist with Merrill Lynch
in London yesterday. 'And they seem to have done it without squabbling. We
are obviously in a new era.'
The nature of some of the measures - in particular the curb on spending in
the social security sector - is another indication of the urgency of the
government's task.
In the past, centre-left coalitions like this one have shied away from
penalising Belgian citizens in socially sensitive areas.
Whether the package - which includes a 1 per cent social security tax and a
new 'taxe de luxe' on cars - will achieve the impact predicted by Mr Dehaene
is a different matter.
Mr Peter Claes, an economist with Banque Bruxelles Lambert in Brussels,
pointed out yesterday that although the mechanical effect of direct measures
is comparatively easy to calculate, it is less easy to predict how much will
be saved by, for example, plans to tighten up on dole fraud, or close
loopholes in the tax system.
'You have to look at the social and political impact, as well as the
financial impact of such measures,' he added.
Budget proposals require only a simple majority in the Belgian parliament,
which will not pose any problem for the centre-left coalition.
But to achieve his government's second goal - institutional reform - Mr
Dehaene will have to attract allies from opposition parties to make up a
two-thirds majority.
Formal 'dialogue' between the feuding French-speaking and Flemish
communities of Belgium began yesterday, with the goal of devolving further
powers to the regions peacefully.
However painful the budget cuts, political and economic analysts are worried
that institutional reform will be the issue which derails the Dehaene train.

FT  07 APR 92 / London Stock Exchange: BP/Shell feature strongly
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN, JOEL KIBAZO, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and COLIN MILLHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE OIL majors, British Petroleum and Shell Transport, benefited from a
much-needed recovery as a combination of US support, technical factors and
Middle East tension sent them racing upwards.
Both groups' shares were considered oversold in London last week and a
bounce had been expected. BP also benefited from a reiterated buy stance
from US investment house Merrill Lynch after the market closed on Friday
night. Yesterday's recovery was exacerbated because many traders had left
themselves short of stock at the end of the trading account.
They also bucked the impact of a bearish 37-page report from County NatWest,
published yesterday, to contribute almost 8 points to the rise in the FT-SE
100 Index. BP jumped 12 to 254 1/2 p on very heavy turnover of 21m shares.
Shell leapt 16 to 457p with 4.6m changing hands.
Fears of renewed fighting between Iraq and Iran, the worsening situation in
Libya and talk of a refinery fire in the US prompted a squeeze in crude oil
prices. Brent crude for May delivery reached Dollars 19 a barrel for the
first time in almost two months.
Finally, observers said some UK investors, who had been shunning oils for
some time, were returning to buy them for their defensive qualities. As oil
is quoted in dollars it benefits from a weak pound, and falls in sterling
are anticipated after the UK general election.
Saudis boost BAe
The prospect of further orders from Saudi Arabia under phase two of the Al
Yamamah defence agreement buoyed British Aerospace, the project's lead
contractor. The shares forged ahead 16 to 315p to make the stock the
best-performing FT-SE 100 constituent of the day.
The Saudis have deposited Pounds 1.5bn with BAe as an instalment for the
contract. Among those welcoming the news was broker Strauss Turnbull, which
turned positive on the stock after a two-year bear stance.
Mr Zafar Khan at Strauss said the financial injection of Pounds 1.5bn would
resolve the cash flow problems at the company and predicted: 'The share
price has a potential upside of 380p, last year's rights issue price.
However, the low turnover figure of 1.6m shares was said to be an indication
that scepticism about further orders remains. Mr Chris Avery at Smith New
Court said: 'This breaks the log jam, but the market is looking for more
positive confirmation of orders.'
Boots weakens
Stores were generally firm following stronger than expected consumer credit
figures for February, but Boots weakened 9 1/2 to 406 1/2 p in active
trading of 4.4m shares as the market took fright on news of a 7 per cent pay
rise for counter staff. The company said this was partly a catching-up
exercise and that any increase in the wage bill above the level of inflation
will be corrected through productivity gains.
Nomura last week downgraded its 1992-93 profits forecast for Boots to Pounds
400m from Pounds 410m, but the Japanese-owned securities house indicated
that yesterday's reaction to the pay news was probably overdone.
Brewing group Whitbread was swamped by news that included denied rumours
about a link with Dutch brewer Heineken, and a failure to reach agreement on
the future of its joint venture with Pizza Hut International. The shares
were, however, particularly depressed by an exceptional charge of Pounds 37m
for bad and doubtful debts in the year recently ended.
On heavy turnover of 3.7m shares, Whitbread 'A' dropped 19 1/2 to 358 1/2 p
as the company blamed falling property values in southern England, where the
beer trade has been badly affected by the recession, for the provision.
Mr John Wakely at Shearson Lehman Brothers said Whitbread, with its large
loans on public houses in the south, might be at the sharp end, but this was
the 'tip of an iceberg' and bad news for the industry in general.
Bass, regarded as less exposed to the problems of southern England, eased
only 2 to 518p, while Allied-Lyons lost 5 to 578p.
Banking issues joined in the general market strength after last week's
savaging. Barclays, the worst hit, picked up 7 to 294p. Lloyds gained 7 to
348p and NatWest 12 to 265p, but Midland, which has been buoyed by hopes
over the proposed merger with Hongkong and Shanghai Banking, dipped 2 to
337p.
A large line of Forte stock (2m shares) was placed at 221p. The stock
declined 7 to 215p.
Thorn EMI, boosted by County NatWest reiterating its buy recommendation,
added 9 at 747p.
Glaxo was a weak spot, losing 6 to 761p. US approval of its anti-migraine
drug Immigran is said to be slightly less imminent than previously thought.
Weekend press comment and political factors lifted Cable and Wireless. The
positive view in some corners of the media echoed an analysts' meeting a
week previously in which C and W promised to tighten its investment
strategy. Sentiment was also helped by the group's overseas earnings record
on the back of continued nervousness over a Labour-led government.
The shares, which reached 532p at one stage, ended at 528p for a gain of 8
on the day.
Vodafone Group's recent dismal run continued, in spite of some encouraging
figures on new cellular telephone connections. The stock slipped 5 to 303p
as worries about possible fresh regulatory measures for the sector under a
new government persisted.
Recently out-of-favour food retailer Albert Fisher increased its market
valuation by nearly 10 per cent as an institution bought a block of 500,000
shares. On heavy turnover of 2.4m, the shares rose 6 to 69p.
Tesco gained 9 to 251p ahead of today's results, while a buy recommendation
from Henderson Crosthwaite helped to lift Argyll 7 to 318p.
Vosper Thornycroft, another beneficiary of the Al Yamamah project, put on 6
to 248p on the prospect of further orders.
Talk that a Labour government would cancel a fourth Trident submarine faded,
helping VSEL bounce 5 to 300p following last week's falls.
Weekend press reports of renewed merger talks between British Airways and
Dutch airliner KLM helped the former add 6 at 247p.
A large agency cross in Saatchi &amp; Saatchi was responsible for most of the
advertising company's turnover of 32m shares yesterday. SG Warburg
Securities crossed 12m shares with institutions at 14p apiece. The stock
finished  3/4 cheaper at 14 3/4 p.

FT  07 APR 92 / London Stock Exchange: New account sees share prices rally
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PROSPECT of a change in the complexion of the UK government after
Thursday's general election failed to trigger any further slide in a UK
equity market now regarded by many observers as already discounting just
about every possible election scenario.
On the contrary, the market moved decisively higher throughout the first
session, stimulated by positive noises from UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, the
securities house, in what is expected to be a three-week trading account of
tremendous significance to the UK.
The FT-SE 100-share Index, which dropped around 64 points over the previous
two-week account, slipped smoothly into gear after an uncertain opening,
eventually closing 18.2 better at 2,400.9.
There was an air of uncertainty in the market at the outset after a series
of weekend opinion polls continued to give Labour a slight lead over the
Conservatives, indicating a hung parliament, possibly led by a
Labour/Liberal Democrat coalition.
The Footsie opened around five points lower, although the fall was easily
accounted for by a number of the constituents being quoted ex-dividend. Wall
Street's closing 15-point gain on Friday was seen as a stabilising influence
and from then on the market moved quickly to the uptick.
Dealers said good gains shortly after the opening came as the Footsie future
embarked on a strong upward move, coinciding with keen support for equities
from UBS Phillips &amp; Drew. It was also pointed out that many traders had been
carrying short books over the weekend, anticipating bad news for the
Conservatives in the latest batch of polls.
The Footsie, spearheaded by a sparkling performance from British Aerospace,
after a Pounds 1.5bn cash injection from Saudi Arabia, linked with the Al
Yamamah defence contract, and hefty gains in the oil sector, raced ahead to
a session's high of 2,404.4 ahead of the opening shots on Wall Street.
Turnover in London, however, was a miserable 411.5m shares.
The Footsie faltered as the session drew to a close, wobbling as an opinion
poll based on marginal constituencies showed Labour well ahead of the
Tories. But as one top trader pointed out: 'There is scope for a rise in
London from here. The market only needs a spark of good news.' He mentioned
2,300/2,350 as a solid floor for the Footsie 'even with a Labour
government'.
Outstanding gains in oil shares caught the market on the hop and were
responsible for around eight points on the index. Demand was mostly
US-sourced and European analysts remained unconvinced of a sustained upturn
in oil prices.
Mr Mark Brown, equity market strategist at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, said the
market was 'beginning to look attractive once more in risk-reward terms;
below 2,400 the downside is limited in the event of a Labour government or
an unstable hung parliament. There is little in the market for a Tory
minority government or a coalition between Labour and the Liberal
Democrats.'
UBS concluded: 'The weighted average of five possible election outcomes
gives a year-end Footsie level of around 2,650.'

FT  07 APR 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Oils feature trading as Dow
climbs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
US STOCKS posted good gains yesterday afternoon in thin trading, with most
of the strength coming from the oil sector, writes Karen Zagor in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average of 30 blue chips finished 26.38 higher at
3,275.49. New York SE volume, however, was too light, at 179.9m shares, to
indicate an overwhelming improvement in market sentiment, and on the big
board advancing issues led those declining by 1,036 to 678. On Friday the
Dow closed at 3,249.11, up 14.99.
A slightly stronger gain was posted by the more representative Standard &amp;
Poor's 500, which added 4.04 at 405.59, while the Nasdaq composite of
over-the-counter stocks moved more sharply higher, by 6.28 to 596.29.
Energy issues dominated big board trading. Exxon and Texaco were among the
most active stocks, moving ahead Dollars 1 7/8 to Dollars 57 3/4 and Dollars
2 1/8 to Dollars 61 1/8 respectively.
Oil shares started to rally on Friday on the back of firming crude oil
prices and positive comments by Merrill Lynch, which estimated that crude
could rise to Dollars 24 a barrel by the end of the year if uncertainties
over supply from unstable regions such as the former Soviet Union and
Venezuela continue.
Chevron firmed Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 67 3/8 in spite of reports that its
Port Arthur, Texas, oil refinery might be shut down for two weeks following
an equipment failure at the 180,000 barrels-a-day operation.
Among other newsworthy oil companies, Amoco added Dollars 1 1/8 at Dollars
44 3/4 and Union Carbide firmed Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 24 3/4 after fires
broke out in a number of Texas City plants. Amoco has said its operations
were unaffected by the fire.
Pacific Gas and Electric slipped Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 29 1/4 , Unocal
climbed Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 22 3/4 and oil-services company
Schlumberger rose Dollars 3 7/8 to Dollars 58 3/8 .
Wal-Mart, the extremely successful Arkansas-based retail chain, climbed
Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 52 7/8 in very active trading on news of the death
of its founder.
Amerada Hess rose Dollars 2 7/8 to Dollars 42 on unusually heavy volume
after several analysts upgraded their ratings on the stock.
India Growth Fund fell Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 23 7/8 after the fund
changed its exchange rate for translating rupees into dollars. As a result,
the fund's net asset value was devalued by about 20 per cent.
USF&amp;G jumped Dollars 1 to Dollars 9 1/4 after Kidder Peabody increased its
rating on the insurance stock to 'buy' from 'hold'.
In over-the-counter trading, Intel forged ahead Dollars 3 1/8 to Dollars 57
7/8 , Apple Computer advanced Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 60 3/4 and Microsoft
added Dollars 3 3/4 at Dollars 121 1/4 .
Canada
SHARP GAINS in oil issues countered losses in banks, leaving Toronto flat
after a day of slow trade. Escalating tensions between Iran and Iraq and a
jump in IPE May Brent crude above an important resistance level of USDollars
19 per barrel boosted the oils sector.
The composite index closed just 0.4 up at at 3,385.9. Falls led rises by 287
to 227 after volume of 19.6m shares.
Olympia &amp; York's debt troubles fuelled selling in bank shares while lifting
Home Oil on speculation that the oil and gas company will be sold at a
premium to the market price.
Home Oil, controlled by O &amp; Y, has been up for sale for about two years and
the latter has said for over a year that it has had off-and-on talks with
potential buyers. The former climbed CDollars 1 1/2 to CDollars 16 1/2 , a
52-week high.
SOUTH AFRICA was closed yesterday for a public holiday and will re-open
today.

FT  07 APR 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Escudo makes firm debut
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UNEASY calm reigned over the UK foreign exchange market yesterday, with most
activity centred on the smaller European currencies, writes Emma Tucker.
The Portuguese escudo made its debut in the European Monetary System at a
central rate of Ecu178.735, with a permitted divergence of 6 per cent above
or below its central rate against other currencies.
Backed by an attractive interest rate, the Portuguese unit rose rapidly to
its ceiling against sterling - still the bottom-placed currency in the EMS -
in early morning trading. Three-month interest rates stand at around 13 per
cent in Portugal.
Early intervention by the Bank of Portugal, which bought sterling and
D-Marks, was followed by a cut in the bank's money market intervention
rates. But the escudo remained firm, closing at 85.86/96 against the D-Mark
after 85.57/67. This was above the 86.30/35 rate before Friday's
announcement that the currency was to join the EMS.
In Italy, the central bank intervened to support the lira, selling D-Marks
and Ecus, as the first returns from Sunday's general election suggested that
the Christian-Democrat alliance was going to lose its majority in
parliament. The Italian currency declined against the D-Mark to L756.20/40,
from L755.10/20 on Friday.
The dollar drifted downwards in quieter trading than last week, with the
high yield of the D-Mark plus the crawling pace of the US recovery
conspiring to keep the US currency down. It added  1/2 pfennig to recent
sharp losses in late trading as investors waited for the currency to go even
lower before buying.
Mr Nick Parsons at Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce said a much speedier
economic recovery had been factored into the dollar, which climbed 9 1/2 per
cent in the first six weeks of this year. He added: 'The scale and speed of
that movement suggest there were some very exaggerated assumptions about the
pace and scale of the recovery.'
The US currency finished in London at DM1.6210, after a DM1.6245 start and a
DM1.6290 Tokyo close. It slipped to Y132.75/85 from a Y133.14/24 opening. In
New York the dollar improved to end at DM1.6255 and Y133.17.
The Finnish markka stabilised yesterday after Friday's turmoil. It was
helped by an emergency package of government spending cuts, a sharp rise in
interest rates and a number of currency swap deals with European central
banks.
The pound, meanwhile, rested in the wings after last week's hectic trading.
It weakened in the morning on news of the escudo's entry to the EMS but
later stabilised. Dealers reported a big buy order for sterling, but it had
little effect on the currency's rate, which closed at DM2.8375 after a
DM2.8386 opening.

FT  07 APR 92 / Money Markets: Rates stay firm
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
QUIET conditions made for another dull session in the money markets
yesterday.
Rates continued to show pressure for a rise of at least half a point in the
UK's base rate after the general election. The key three-month interbank
rate began  1/16 firmer at 11 1/8 -11 per cent, but eased during the day to
close at 11-10 15/16 .
Interbank dealers said investors were lending and borrowing at the very
short end, reluctant to take on obligations beyond one week because of
intense political uncertainty.
Short sterling futures opened down at 88.67. But during the day the contract
was squeezed as investors who left themselves short on sterling last week
scrambled to make-up the shortage. It gained 17 basis points with 30,307
lots exchanged and closed at 88.88.
The contract will open around one hour earlier on April 10, the day after
the general election, to give exchange members wider access to the
marketplace.
Mr Nick Parsons, head of the treasury advisory group at Canadian Imperial
Bank, said the market was beginning to see increasing value in the 9 to
12-month area as the idea of two elections this year, with the Tory party
victorious in a second, October, election started to circulate in the City.
Although a definite lead for Labour emerged in the weekend's opinion polls,
the results still point to either a hung parliament with Labour as the
biggest party, or to a very slim Labour majority.
The market scenario, according to Mr Parsons, is that given the state of
public sector finance and the nervousness of the currency markets, the
Labour government would probably have to raise interest rates. This
unpopular measure would make it harder for them to win a second election,
leaving the way open for a Conservative victory.
The June 1993 sterling contract, which opened at 89.85, closed up at 89.93.
Generally money was cheap. The Bank of England revised its initial forecast
liquidity shortage from Pounds 800m to Pounds 900m in the late morning.
Early assistance of Pounds 742m included Pounds 575m of band-1 bank bills,
Pounds 118m of band-2 Treasury bills and Pounds 49m of band-2 bank bills,
all at 10 3/8 per cent. Later it provided further assistance, buying Pounds
158m band-2 bank bills. The shortage was removed before lunch. Overnight
rates closed at 9 1/8-9.

FT  07 APR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Coffee pact must embody four
principles, says US
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REUTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE US will participate in a new International Coffee Agreement with
economic clauses provided consensus is reached on four principles, the head
of the US delegation to the International Coffee Organisation said at the
beginning of a 5-day ICO council session in London yesterday, reports
Reuter.
The principles are a universal quota, market-orientation, an effective
control system and the absence of 'infeasible market interventions', such as
buffer stocks and retention schemes.
'On the other hand, if at the end of the week consensus does not exist, it
is difficult for our delegation to envisage how further talks could be
productive,' said Mr Myles Frechette.
An ICO working group decided last week to recommend that negotiations begin
for a new economic pact to replace the administrative accord that has
operated since the collapse of the organisation's export quota system in
July 1989.
While supportive of a new economic pact, the US statement emphasised that
the US would sign the agreement only if it met the concerns of the US
industry and the US Congress.
'Even if we agree on these general principles, I need to re-emphasise that
selling an agreement to our private sector and to our congress will be no
easy task,' Mr Frechette said.
The most delegates expect of this week's talks is that the council will draw
up a timetable of meetings for negotiations, without negotiations actually
beginning.
Ms Dorothea Werneck, Brazil's National Economy Secretary said: 'We hope to
have a schedule of meetings before the end of this week'.
The only country to have reserved its position on quotas is Mexico, which is
thought to be linking the ICO quota question to agreement on future free
access to the US in the proposed North American Free Trade Agreement.
Coffee prices moved higher in thin trading on the London Futures and Options
Exchange yesterday, as traders awaited news from the ICO meeting. Traders
shared delegates' reservations about the prospects for substantial progress
being made towards a new price-supporting pact.
The July futures position ended at Dollars 883 a tonne, up Dollars 14 from
Friday's close, but Dollars 5 below the high attained during the day. The
early rise was linked to Friday night's rally in the New York market.

FT  07 APR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Explorers fail to match Shell's
oil successes - Tony Walker finds executives disenchanted by the unfulfilled
promise of eastern Syria
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY WALKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHELL OIL company executives in Damascus are looking very pleased with
themselves these days, as well they might, given Shell's continuing
exploration success in eastern Syria towards the Iraqi border.
Good spirits at Shell headquarters in the Syrian capital, however, are
balanced by the gloom among other foreign explorers, who have little to show
for the USDollars 200m-plus they are estimated to have invested in Syria
since 1988.
'This is the year when reality sinks in,' said the representative of an
American company which has been unsuccessful, thus far, in its efforts to
find oil and gas.
British Petroleum has already announced that it is pulling out, and others,
including Enron, the small American independent, are expected to follow
suit.
For the more than half dozen oil explorers who were attracted by Shell's
successes in the mid-1980s, Syria has proved disappointing.
For Shell itself, success has followed upon success, and with its partner,
Deminex of West Germany, it is continuing to make finds in its Ash Sham
concession whose lease expires in May this year.
Shell officials are coy about production figures, and about reserves in
their exploration zone, but the company, through its Al Furat operating
company (in which the Syrian Petroleum Company has a 50 per cent share), is
reliably reported to be pumping about 345,000 barrels a day of light, easily
marketable crude from its Deir ez Zawr and Ash Sham fields.
With the additional finds made recently, it may well lift production to a
considerably higher plateau.
Assuming that the Syrian Petroleum Company is producing 160,000-80,000 b/d
of heavy, sulphurous crude from its well-established Sweidiyeh field in
Syria's north-east corner, Syrian total production is now comfortably above
500,000 b/d. About two-thirds of production is available for export.
Latest balance of payment figures, included in the IMF's Article IV report
on the Syrian economy, show that oil sales, as well as new aid flows from
the Gulf as reward for Damascus's support of the anti-Iraq alliance in the
Gulf war, dramatically improved Syria's financial position in 1990-91.
Earnings from oil in 1990 attained nearly USDollars 2bn. The figure was
lower, about USDollars 1.7bn last year, because of the softer oil market.
Grants and soft loans from the Gulf totalled USDollars 1.5bn in 1990-91,
sharply improving Syria's overall balance of payments in those years.
According to an IMF forecast, however, Syria's payment's position will again
start to become precarious this year. That is certain to add to pressures
for more rapid exploitation of Syrian reserves, which now stand officially
at about 1.7bn barrels.
Mr Mtanios Habib, Syria's oil minister, said last June that within two years
Syria aimed to treble production. That is almost certainly over-ambitious,
although Syria is edging its way to being a relatively significant
Mediterranean producer. A further increase in production by the mid-1990s
cannot be ruled out. Further finds by Shell will determine this.
As the May deadline approaches for Shell to relinquish its Ash Sham
concession, the company has about ten drilling rigs working overtime to
ensure there is no repeat of its recent painful experience when Elf
Aquitaine of France made a commercial discovery in Shell's surrendered Deir
ez Zawr acreage.
Oil industry representatives say that there is some talk of an arrangement
that might allow Shell to continue exploring in the Ash Sham concession
beyond the May deadline, but at this stage Shell executives assume that they
will be obliged to relinquish the acreage on the due date.
Among other foreign players in the field, Occidental of the US is pushing
ahead. Occidental has two years of a three-year exploration agreement to run
on its 8,000 sq km block in central Syria.
However, other companies, such as Repsol of Spain, which has also been
exploring in central Syria, and Unocal (formerly Union Oil of California),
which has been searching near the Turkish border, are reported to be
drilling their last wells and are likely to join the exodus if they are not
successful.
Marathon has been sitting on a fairly sizeable gas find but at this stage
there is no sign of it beginning commercial exploitation. Indeed, company
representatives are reported to be 'not very enthusiastic'. Syria's domestic
market is limited, although power stations are being converted to 'dual use'
technology. Export prospects are not especially encouraging.

FT  07 APR 92 / International Bonds: Flurry of dollar activity fails to
excite investors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE international bond market sprung to life yesterday. However, the clutch
of new issues launched in US, Canadian and Australian dollars met an
unenthusiastic response from investors still unsure whether to commit funds.
The most ambitious offer of the day came from Export Development Corporation
of Canada, which launched a Dollars 400m 10-year deal, lead-managed by
Credit Suisse First Boston.
The 7 3/4 per cent paper was priced to yield 27 basis points more than US
government bonds, considered slightly aggressive in a market which has seen
lacklustre demand for dollar-denominated bonds.
The lead manager said US employment statistics released on Friday had
improved the tone of both the Eurodollar and US Treasury bond market. It
reported steady buying from institutional investors in east Asia and
European retail investors.
However, while the borrower is a popular and relatively rare visitor to the
Euromarket, the deal elicited a mixed response. The lead manager quoted the
bonds at a yield spread of 27 basis points during the day.
A contrasting dollar issue came from Ericsson, the Swedish
telecommunications company, which launched a Dollars 150m five-year deal,
also lead-managed by CSFB. The 7 3/4 per cent bonds were priced to yield 90
basis points more than Treasuries, in line with the yield spread available
on other recent issues by corporations of single-A credit quality.
However, again the pricing was seen by participants as too tight in
difficult market conditions. The deal was held at the fixed re-offer price
until the close of trading.
The Province of British Columbia tested demand for Canadian dollars with a
CDollars 300m five-year issue, lead-managed by Swiss Bank Corporation. The 9
1/4 per cent bonds were priced to yield 54 basis points more than the
benchmark five-year Canadian government bond.
The pricing was seen as generous by syndicate officials, although some
commented that - like the EDC deal - the issue was too large to be easily
absorbed. While some reported switching by continental European investors
out of D-Mark paper and into higher-yielding Canadian dollar bonds, demand
is largely restricted to investors re-investing the proceeds of maturing
bond issues. Around CDollars 1.5bn in bonds mature this month, and CDollars
2bn in May.
From a fixed re-offer price of 99.86, the bonds traded down to 99.75 bid by
late afternoon, while Canadian government bonds were little changed. The
yield spread widened to around 57 basis points.
Canadian National Railways, the state-owned, but not government-guaranteed,
rail company, launched a retail-targeted CDollars 150m seven-year deal
lead-managed by ScotiaMcleod. The bonds, priced to yield 70 basis points
more than the benchmark 9 1/2 per cent Canadian government bond maturing
1998, saw some buying from retail investors but generated little enthusiasm.
The deal was held at the fixed re-offer price of 99.42 throughout the day.
Commonwealth Bank of Australia came with a ADollars 100m offering of 9 3/4
per cent bond maturing 1996 and priced to yield 50 basis points more than
Australian government bonds. From an issue price of 101.75, the deal,
lead-managed by CBA itself, traded at less 1.62 bid, inside full fees of
1.75 per cent.
IBCA, the European credit rating agency, has lowered its ratings for nine
Japanese banks previously placed on rating watch, Reuter reports from New
York.
IBCA blamed the current weakness in the Tokyo stock market for its
decision,along with the trend inthe Japanese real estatemarkets and the
state of the economy.
The ratings changes affect Tokai Bank, Bank of Tokyo, Hokkaido Takushoku
Bank, Nippon Credit Bank, Mitsubishi Trust &amp; Banking, Sumitomo Trust &amp;
Banking, Mitsui Trust &amp; Banking, Yasuda Trust &amp; Banking, Toyo Trust &amp;
Banking.
IBCA said the weakness in the Tokyo stock market threatened to undermine the
recent improvement in the operating profits of Japanese banks.

FT  07 APR 92 / International Capital Markets: Mixed reaction to Portugal's
EMS entry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   LISBON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Portuguese capital market offered mixed reaction yesterday to the
escudo's entry into the exchange rate mechanism of the European Monetary
System (EMS) at the weekend, and the subsequent announcement of a cut in the
central bank's main interest rates, writes Patrick Blum in Lisbon.
Prices for government securities rose slightly, but not as much as had been
expected, as many investors had anticipated a decline in interest rates. The
escudo's entry into the ERM was generally seen as a positive step,
encouraging demand for Portuguese-denominated securities. Prices rose
slightly, but domestic buyers remained more cautious.
'There hasn't been a big rush to buy now. People are waiting to see what
happens with tomorrow's auction of FIPs (government floating-rate notes),'
said Mr Luis Nogueira, an analyst with merchant bank Finantia.
The issue, for Es15bn with an eight-year maturity and a coupon of 18.6875
per cent, is expected to sell at around 107 per cent.
Mr Nogueira said the formal link-up of the escudo in the ERM would make
Portuguese securities more attractive.
Prices and yields for FIPs remained stable, with more noticeable changes for
fixed-rate notes, whose prices rose between 1.1 and 2.4 percentage points
and yields by 0.5 to 0.75 percentage points.

NORDIC government bond markets regained a semblance of calm yesterday after
Friday's panic-selling, as the Finnish government averted fears of a
devaluation in the Finnish markka and stemmed the heavy outflows of currency
from the region.
Finland and Sweden saw sharp increases in short- and long-term interest
rates on Friday, and a massive outflow of currency, following the
resignation of the governor of the Bank of Finland.
However, Finland announced big cuts in government spending at the weekend in
an attempt to calm the financial markets and stem fears of a devaluation of
the markka.
The Nordic central banks also pledged to help stabilise the markka at the
weekend, while the Bundesbank added its promise of support.
Finland's government bond market witnessed further rises in yields
yesterday, although dealers said the increase was held in check by the
announcement that the Bank of Finland had reached a swap agreement with the
Bundesbank in addition to those reached with the other Nordic central banks
at the weekend.
The bank was forced to intervene in order to support the currency during
trading, and the markka firmed slightly against the Ecu compared with
Friday's level.
The yield on the government bond due 2001, which carries a coupon of 11 per
cent, rose to 11.70 per cent, against Friday's midday fixing level of 11.65
per cent. Short-term interest rates soared as the market opened, with the
one-month Helibor rate jumping from Friday's close of 16.76 per cent to a
high of 25 per cent on Monday, before falling back to between 18 and 19 per
cent by the afternoon.
SWEDEN'S government bond market ended the day higher, as investors gained
confidence from Finland's economic package and from the Swedish central
bank's resolute defence of the Swedish krona.
The Riksbank, Sweden's central bank, raised the overnight call rate - the
rate applicable to bank loans to the Riksbank - to 13 per cent from 11 per
cent in an effort to turn the tide of currency flows.
On Friday, SKr22bn swept out of Sweden because of the Finnish crisis, but
traders reported a strong inflow of currency yesterday.
'The increase in the interest rate demonstrates the Riksbank's determination
to defend the krona's fixed exchange rate' said Mr Bengt Dennis, the
governor.
The move prompted strong buying of securities, pushing down yields across
the maturity range. The yield on the 10.75 per cent bond due 1997 fell from
Friday's close of 10.12 per cent to 9.93 per cent, below the level of 9.99
per cent that it traded at on Thursday, before the crisis.
Likewise, the yield on the 13 per cent issue due June 2001 fell back to 9.53
per cent, against Friday's close of 9.64 per cent and Thursday's level of
9.61 per cent.
However, at the short end of the market, three-month Treasury bills failed
to regain their pre-crisis levels, with the yield reaching 12.20 per cent,
against 12.45 per cent at Friday's close and 11.75 per cent on Thursday.
ITALIAN government bond prices were driven down 0.40 point by political
uncertainty, in active trading.
Early results showed a swing away from the ruling four-party coalition,
prompting speculation that a new coalition government will have to be
formed.
Uncertainty about the political situation also knocked the lira back,
prompting the Bank of Italy to support the lira against the D-Mark through
intervention.
The BTP Italian government bond future on the London International Financial
Futures and Options Exchange (Liffe) was quoted at 97.89 in late trading,
down from Friday's 98.31. Trading of the contract starts 35 minutes early
today at 7.35am, to allow for further election-generated activity, after
record volume of around 30,000 contracts yesterday.
GERMAN government bonds rallied about  1/2 point on news of a wage
settlement in the German banking sector. Bund futures on Liffe ended up 0.47
point, at 87.81.
Dealers said the market had been oversold, and support had materialised
around the 8 per cent yield level. The poor performance of the Christian
Democrats in some regional elections had no apparent impact.
FRENCH government bonds tracked the German market, as the French market
maintained the positive tone created by the appointment of Mr Pierre
Beregevoy, former finance minister, as prime minister.
The continuation of a firm monetary policy was underlined yesterday, further
confidence after last week's poor regional election results for the ruling
socialists.
The OAT future on the Matif, the Paris futures exchange, close at 107.96, up
0.40 point.
US TREASURIES were narrowly lower yesterday in thin, featureless trading.
In late trading, the Treasury's bellwether 30-year bond was  3/16 lower at
101 7/32 , yielding 7.89 per cent. Shorter-dated maturities were firmer in
morning trading, but gave up most of their gains in the afternoon, when the
three-year note was quoted unchanged on the day to yield 5.85 per cent.
The Federal Reserve abstained from operating in the open market. Fed Funds
were trading at 3 15/16 per cent during the Fed's usual intervention period.
In the absence of any significant economic news, the bond market continued
to take heart from Friday's employment report. The market interpreted
Friday's release of a slim, 19,000 increase in non-farm payrolls for March
as evidence of a slight recovery.
The initial strength at the short end of the yield curve was inspired by
hopes that a weak economic recovery will prevent the Fed from tightening
monetary policy in the short term.
UK GOVERNMENT bonds traded lower as the weakness of sterling within the
European exchange rate mechanism raised fears of a post-election devaluation
of the UK currency.
The Portuguese central bank bought sterling against the escudo on the first
day of trading for the Portuguese currency within the ERM. This increased
fears that the arrival of the strong Portuguese currency in the system will
increase pressure on sterling, which remains pinned at the bottom of the ERM
grid.
The gilt futures contract on Liffe fell to 93.04 during the morning session,
having opened at 93.15. However, during the afternoon the nerve of the
market steadied and the contract recovered to close at 93.14. Volume was a
healthy 27,000 contracts.
In the cash market, the benchmark 9 per cent gilt maturing 2011 closed down
just  1/32 of a point on the day at 94.00, for a yield of 9.68 per cent.
AFTER last week's collapse in Japanese government bond prices, heavy
official intervention to buy bonds helped to prop up the market.
In the early afternoon in Tokyo, the Ministry of Finance offered to buy
Y100bn worth of 10-year bonds, using its National Consolidation Fund - a
'sinking' fund set up to repay government debt when it falls due. It was the
first time the fund had been used since the summer of 1990, when the yield
on 10-year bonds stood at over 8.5 per cent.
