PROVIGO, Canada's second -largest food distributor, was hit by the recession
and east Canada price wars in the fourth quarter ended January 25.
Net profit was CDollars 6.2m (USDollars 5.21m) or 7 cents a share on sales
of CDollars 1.5bn, down from CDollars 15.1m or 18 cents a share on sales of
CDollars 1.6bn a year earlier.
For the full year, Provigo earned CDollars 49.3m or 57 cents a share, up
from CDollars 700,000 or 1 cent a share a year earlier after special
charges, on sales of CDollars 6.7bn, up 3 per cent. Provigo said fiscal 1993
would be another difficult year due to the recession.
He denied rumours that Provigo may team up with Loblaw, Canada's largest
food distributor, to buy part of the loss-making Steinberg supermarket group
in east Canada.
Imasco, the tobacco, fast-food retailing and financial services group, plans
to raise CDollars 150m by an issue of 10-year debentures in Canada.

<TEXT>
MR LI KA-SHING, Hong Kong's richest man, yesterday confirmed he was
interested in acquiring some of Olympia &amp; York's assets.
O&amp;Y, the world's largest private landlord, is negotiating with its bankers
to reschedule Dollars 20bn of debts.
A spokesman for Mr Li would give no details of his plans except that he was
interested in some of O&amp;Y's assets. Mr Li stood down from the board of the
Hongkong and Shanghai Bank last week so he could devote himself fully to his
business interests.
Mr Li, dubbed 'superman' by the local Hong Kong media, is one of the few big
players in international property with the resources to acquire O&amp;Y's
assets. Cheung Kong, his flagship, is estimated to generate cash flows of
over Dollars 1bn a year.
Mr Li, who is one of the biggest landowners in Vancouver, is also a 9 per
cent shareholder in Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce - the Canadian bank
which is estimated to have lent O&amp;Y CDollars 1bn (USDollars 840m).
Last October, in his first venture into the US property market, he bought
for his own account a 49 per cent interest in a New York office building,
formerly Drexel Burnham Lambert's head office, from O&amp;Y for an estimated
Dollars 47.5m.
The New York office block is held through a joint venture partnership,
guaranteed by O&amp;Y's US subsidiary. Mr Li took pains yesterday to state,
through a spokesman, that his investment in that building was unaffected by
the difficulties facing O&amp;Y.
In a joint statement at the time the two parties said the transaction
signalled 'an important strategic alliance' between Mr Li and O&amp;Y.
This announcement followed persistent reports he was considering an
investment in Canary Wharf, Europe's biggest single property development
situated in the east end of London. Since then the two have not announced
plans to co-operate on any more business ventures.
Mr Li may, however, be interested in more than just O&amp;Y property assets. O&amp;Y
owns 75 per cent of Gulf Canada Resources, one of Canada's largest refiners
of oil and distributors of petrol.
Mr Li controls Husky Oil, Canada's biggest producer of natural gas and oil,
through two listed Hong Kong companies. Gulf Canada Resources would give him
a fully integrated energy business in Canada.
Against this, analysts said, Husky has been a poor investment, at least in
the short term, and he could face competition problems if he were to buy
Gulf Resources, not to mention a backlash from Canada's vocal economic
nationalists.

FT  07 APR 92 / International Company News: Ingersoll-Rand sees signs of
upturn
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
HIGHER US infrastructural spending and hopeful signs in the economy were
improving the outlook for construction equipment producers, said Mr Bill
Mulligan, executive vice-president of Ingersoll-Rand, yesterday.
'We think the market has turned,' Mr Mulligan said, a 40-year veteran of the
US industrial and construction equipment producer.
He was speaking at the Bauma construction equipment exhibition in Munich,
which opened yesterday amid generally depressed conditions for the Dollars
25bn-Dollars 28bn world market. Mr Mulligan admitted Ingersoll-Rand had seen
signs of an upturn eight months ago, although that had proved to be an
aberration.
But everything now pointed to improving trends for the construction market
in the US.
Ingersoll-Rand's road-paving and compacting equipment businesses are direct
beneficiaries of the infrastructural spending bill signed by US President
George Bush last year.
Mr Mulligan said the private sector construction business remained quiet.
The company's net earnings fell last year from Dollars 185.3m, or Dollars
3.55 a share, to Dollars 150.6m, or Dollars 2.91, reflecting its wide spread
of customers in industry and construction.
The relatively strong performance - most other large US construction
equipment companies lost money last year - was also underpinned by European
expansion.
Last year, Ingersoll-Rand reached its target of Dollars 1bn of sales in
Europe, the Middle East and Africa a year early. Sales in this 'European
served area' have jumped from 17 per cent of the worldwide total in 1987 to
27 per cent. Mr Mulligan said Ingersoll-Rand was prepared to make further
acquisitions in Europe, on top of two in Germany and one in France over the
past three years.
The purchases of ABG, a German road-making equipment producer, and Klemm, a
manufacturer of specialised hydraulic drills, have significantly expanded
the company's German presence, although its market share remained relatively
small, said Mr Mulligan.
Mr Heinz Henrich, ABG's marketing manager, said German demand for
road-making equipment was being spurred not only by much-needed
infrastructural spending in eastern Germany but by tough German
environmental regulations, introduced in 1986 and subsequently strengthened,
requiring recycling of road asphalt.

post-tax profits
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
WALL Street's booming trading conditions were underlined yesterday when
securities companies belonging to the New York Stock Exchange reported
record after-tax profits of Dollars 3.86bn for 1991.
The total compared with a loss of Dollars 106m in 1990 and the previous
record of Dollars 3.62bn, set in 1986.
The record was achieved thanks to sharp rises in equity and bond markets,
together with extremely heavy issuance of new stocks and fixed income
securities, which are underwritten by Wall Street firms.
This year has also started well, with Wall Street reaping record
underwriting fees in the first quarter - some Dollars 1.73bn, compared with
the record Dollars 1.6bn set in the fourth quarter of last year.
However, observers question whether this hectic pace can be kept up over the
course of the year.
In the fourth quarter of last year the stock exchange firms made after-tax
profits of Dollars 1.20bn, compared with a Dollars 128m loss a year earlier.
In the third quarter of 1991 they reported profits of Dollars 842m.
The figures do not include specialists who make markets in stocks on the
floor of the exchange, but do not deal with the public.
Revenues in 1991 totalled a record Dollars 61.31bn, up 13.4 per cent from
1990's Dollars 54.05bn.
The previous peak was Dollars 59.54bn in 1989.
Fourth-quarter revenues were Dollars 15.35bn, up 15 per cent from a year
earlier.
Revenues totalled Dollars 15.25bn in the third quarter.
The full-year profits represented a 10.2 per cent annual return on the
average net worth of Dollars 37.82bn.
NYSE said member firms' expenses for 1991 were Dollars 55.46bn, up 2.3 per
cent from Dollars 54.19bn in 1990 and the second highest on record.
The highest was Dollars 57.69bn in 1989.

WASTE Management, the Chicago-based waste disposer, yesterday fixed a price
of about Dollars 10.24 a share on the 75m shares it is offering to investors
in New York, London and elsewhere in a flotation of its international
operations.
Waste Management, the world's largest disposer of waste, is raising Dollars
770m through the offering of a 20 per cent stake in the international
business. The offering involves a placing of 26m shares in the UK market; an
offer for sale of 30m shares in the US, packaged as 15m American depositary
shares (ADS), each representing two ordinary shares; and an offer of 18.75m
shares in other markets.
Last night in New York the ADS were priced at Dollars 20.475 each through
underwriters led by Merrill Lynch. That implies a price of Dollars 10.237
for each share in the international offering.
Of the 375m shares expected to be outstanding after the issue, parent Waste
Management will hold 56 per cent.

Wal-Mart
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
WAL-MART, the discount chain, yesterday named Mr S. Robson 'Rob' Walton as
chairman of America's largest and most influential retailing group in
succession to Mr Sam Walton, his father and the founder of the business, who
died on Sunday.
The 47-year-old new chairman is the eldest of Mr Sam Walton's four children
and has been a member of the Wal-Mart board since 1978.
The Walton family holds 38 per cent of Wal-Mart'stock.
Mr Sam Walton, who died in Little Rock, Arkansas, aged 74, after a long
struggle with cancer, had stepped down as chief executive of Wal-Mart in
1988, handing over day-to-day responsibility for running the business to a
management team headed by Mr David Glass.
Wal-Mart emphasised yesterday that Mr Rob Walton's assumption of the
chairmanship would mean no changes in group policy or direction.
The company would 'continue to look for operational guidance from its
current management team'.
Wal-Mart shares moved higher in active trading, and at close of trade on the
New York Stock Exchange were up Dollars 1 1/4 at Dollars 52 7/8 .
In spite of the company's assurances, there remains some doubts on Wall
Street as to whether Wal-Mart can be quite the success it was under Mr Sam
Walton, who exerted a charismatic charm over the business right up to his
death.
There is also concern over Wal-Mart's ability to maintain its extraordinary
pace of growth as it pushes into food retailing, and experiments with
own-label products, at the same time as it expands geographically and faces
sharper competition from other large discount chains such as K-Mart.

FT  07 APR 92 / International Company News: Founder most important retailer
of his generation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SAM WALTON was arguably the most important retailer of his generation. The
son of an Oklahoma real-estate broker, he opened the first general store in
what was to become the Wal-Mart chain in Bentonville, in the backwaters of
Arkansas, in 1950, writes Martin Dickson.
By 1991 the chain's sales had risen to nearly Dollars 44bn, making it the
world's largest retailer in terms of revenues, and the Walton family
probably America's richest.
Wal-Mart now operates in 43 US states, selling goods ranging from detergents
to golf clubs.
The chain's success stemmed both from Mr Walton's personality and
willingness to challenge accepted retailing orthodoxy.
He was a frugal, modest man who worked extremely long hours from a spartan
room in his Bentonville headquarters but delighted in getting out of the
office to tour stores and meet customers and staff, whom he insisted on
calling 'associates.'
He would deliver pep-talks to employees extolling the virtues of thrift and
customer satisfaction, long before these became fashionable management
buzz-words.
Employee satisfaction - an idea which is only now gaining wider acceptance
in US service industries - was also a vital ingredient in the Walton
philosophy.
He buoyed staff morale with cheer-leading sessions, bonus payments for good
performance and profit-sharing plans which allowed some employees of very
modest means to retire relatively wealthy.
Eight years ago, when Wal-Mart's profits were better than expected, he kept
a promise to staff by dressing in a grass-skirt to dance the hula on Wall
Street.
Also essential to Wal-Mart's growth was its pioneering of high volume,
cut-price retailing throughout the year, rather than the periodic sales
which rivals relied on to generate customer loyalty.
'Low prices always' became Wal-Mart's motto.
Mr Walton also disproved the conventional wisdom that large discount stores
could not operate successfully in the small, rural towns of the US south.
It was precisely such locations which became the bedrock of the business,
though in the process Wal-Mart put out of business hundreds of small main
street stores, prompting bitter resistance in some towns which Mr Walton
tended to blunt with generous charitable donations.

FT  07 APR 92 / International Company News: GPA deal tests lease-backed
financing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN and REUTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A NEW source of finance for aircraft leasing may soon be available to
airlines, if an asset-backed transaction being prepared by GPA, the Irish
aircraft leasing group, is successful.
GPA has mandated Citicorp to arrange an issue of Eurobonds backed by
aircraft leases, according to market sources. The deal, expected to total
Dollars 500m, is believed to be the first securitisation of aircraft leases
structured as a public offering. In securitisation, assets are removed from
a company's balance sheet, repackaged as bonds or notes, and sold to
investors through a special-purpose vehicle.
Mortgages, car loans and credit card receivables are among the assets now
commonly securitised.
If the market proves receptive to the GPA deal, the structure is likely to
be imitated by airline companies. Many are in need of new sources of funds
since conventional leasing finance has become increasingly hard to come by.
The securitisation of leases will allow airlines to raise funds from the
bond markets, which most cannot access in their own right because of their
poor credit quality.
The Dollars 500m transaction will be be divided into five tranches. The
first will be a Dollars 200m issue of senior fixed-rate Eurobonds.
They will have a five-year bullet maturity, which means they cannot be
repaid in advance. The risk of pre-payment inherent in many asset-backed
securities is a strong deterrent for many European investors.
The second tranche will consist of a Dollars 200m issue of senior
floating-rate Eurobonds, also with a fixed term of five years. Both tranches
will be offered publicly, and priced to offer a premium to existing classes
of asset-backed debt.
A third tranche totalling Dollars 70m will be structured as a private
placement of amortising floating-rate notes.
The remainder will include Dollars 30m of mezzanine financing and Dollars
100m of equity.
Lockheed and Amerigon formed a partnership to convert unused aerospace
facilities at Lockheed's Burbank Airport plant into headquarters for
Calstart, a government/private sector consortium being formed to create an
electric vehicle and advanced transportation industry in California, Reuter
reports.

AMP Society, Australia's biggest insurance group, lifted the value of its
total assets to ADollars 70.2bn (USDollars 54bn) in 1991, from ADollars
63.6bn a year earlier, but total premium income fell slightly.
Mr Ian Salmon, managing director, announced a fall in total premium income
to ADollars 8.2bn, from ADollars 8.5bn, despite a 36 per cent rise in the
first full-year contribution from UK-based Pearl Assurance, acquired early
in 1990 for ADollars 1.2bn.
AMP's share portfolio, Australia's largest, rose in value to ADollars 30.1bn
from ADollars 22.9bn, but the value of property holdings fell to ADollars
9.7bn from ADollars 11.8bn.
Mr Salmon appealed to the Federal government to stop what he described as
'piecemeal changes' to superannuation policy. He said AMP had reduced costs
by about ADollars 130m in the latest year and planned further savings.

FT  07 APR 92 / International Company News: Dresdner Bank advances to
DM2.2bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR WOLFGANG Roller, chief executive of the Dresdner Bank, yesterday defended
the bank's business and shareholding ties with Allianz, the largest
insurance company in Europe which last week was ordered by the German
federal cartel office to cut back its links with the bank.
Speaking as the bank, the second largest in Germany, reported partial
operating profits up 13.5 per cent to DM2.2bn (Dollars 1.33bn) for last
year, Mr Roller stated that Allianz was in no way seeking to expand its
influence over the bank. He said the insurance company's stake actually
strengthened the independence of the bank by bringing stability to the share
register.
Last week the competition authorities told Allianz and Dresdner that they
must scale down their business co-operation and gave Allianz a provisional
order to cut back its holding in the bank from 22.3 to 19.1 per cent. It
said that the Dresdner links gave Allianz domination of the German life
market and the shareholding gave the insurance company undue influence over
the business strategy pursued by the bank.
Mr Roller said yesterday that business links with Allianz predated the
formal agreement signed in 1989 to sell each others' products by a matter of
decades. He insisted that at a very early stage the bank had decided to
enter the life market by means of a co-operation agreement with insurance
companies rather than by setting up its own subsidiary, as Deutsche Bank did
in 1990.
A more detailed response to the cartel office's findings was being worked on
at the moment by the bank's lawyers, Mr Roller added. They have another five
weeks to put together their formal reply to the authorities, although they
have already spelt out their objections in general terms in a joint
statement published last Thursday.
Reflecting on business conditions last year, Mr Roller said the bank had
benefited from a combination of strong demand for credit and an improvement
of the interest rate margin. Net interest income for the group rose 13.9 per
cent to DM5.39bn from DM4.73bn, while net commission income climbed 8.6 per
cent to DM2.00bn. Staff costs rose 12 per cent to DM3.45bn, mainly because
of the bank's expansion in eastern Germany.
The current year had started off well, with profits up more than 10 per cent
in the first two months, the chief executive said. Business volume was
likely to expand moderately. As previously reported, the dividend for 1991
will be unchanged at DM12 per share.
For the first time, the bank released a figure for total operating profits,
which includes the profit generated by the bank via own-account
share-trading. This was DM2.5bn for the group, up 23 per cent on the
previous year, implying that the group generated profits of some DM300m from
trading last year. At the parent company level, operating profits were up
more sharply by 40 per cent to DM1.8bn, reflecting lower write-offs in 1991
compared with the previous year.
Mr Roller said that the planned share-swap between Dresdner and BNP, the
largest state-controlled bank in France, was proceeding.
He said that the co-operation agreement between the two banks, which has
been the subject of discussion for years, has now been signed by the
supervisory board of both banks and they were working out the practical
details of closer co-operation.
The group's exposure to debt from the former Soviet Union stands at 'less
than DM750m,' Mr Roller said. Some 80 per cent of this has now been provided
for, he disclosed.
Mr Roller is standing down as chief executive as from May 1993 and will be
replaced by Mr Jurgen Sarrazin, the head of international business at
Dresdner. Mr Roller will take over as chairman of the bank's supervisory
board next year. Mr Wolfgang Schieren, formerly Allianz chief executive and
chairman of the insurance company's supervisory board, will join the bank's
supervisory board this year.

suspended

<DATELINE>
   COPENHAGEN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
HAFNIA Holding, the embattled insurance-based financial services group,
yesterday asked for its shares to be suspended by the Copenhagen Stock
Exchange.
In a terse statement explaining the request, the company said that a
'conclusive phase' in negotiations with Norway's UNI Storebrand and Sweden's
Skandia to establish a Nordic alliance had been reached. The suspension was
also aimed at limiting market speculation about the company's future.
However, neither Skandia nor UNI Storebrand's share were suspended. Hafnia
is due to release its 1991 results tomorrow. The group has already warned of
a loss.
Analysts in Copenhagen estimate that the loss will be about DKr300m (Dollars
47.4m), which compares with a loss of DKr1.39bn in 1990. A primary factor in
the poor performance is the large investments which Hafnia has made in its
domestic rivals, Baltica and Skandia.
Danske Bors, the broking arm of Den Danske Bank, estimates that Hafnia has
made an unrealised loss on its large share investments of about DKr1.5bn,
reducing the value of group equity capital from DKr6.5bn at the end of 1989
to about DKr2.5bn at the end of the first quarter of this year.
This and similar estimates have caused Hafnia's shares to fall from over
DKr700 in 1990 to DKr289 when suspended. Hafnia acquired just over a third
of the shares in Baltica Holding in 1990 in an attempt to gain control. It
then made a standing offer of DKr1,000 per share for any new shares issued
by Baltica, but two weeks ago withdrew the offer, giving no explanation.
Last December, UNI Storebrand and Hafnia spearheaded an attempt to gain
control of Skandia, by far the largest Nordic insurance group.
Hafnia has 14.8 per cent of the shares in Skandia, an investment which has
cost about DKr2.5bn.

FT  07 APR 92 / UK Company News: Fortnum &amp; Mason rings up improvement
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
An improving trend at the Piccadilly store, a 47 per cent increase in
exports and tight control over costs helped Fortnum &amp; Mason lift pre-tax
profit by 3 per cent in the 12 months to January 25 1992.
The profit was Pounds 2.12m (Pounds 2.06m) on sales of Pounds 24.9m (Pounds
24.8m). The current accounting period runs for 76 weeks to July 11 but in
the 52 weeks to then it will be difficult to match the profit achieved in
the comparable period, Mr Garry Weston, chairman, warned.
Current trading in Piccadilly had improved over the weak performance of a
year ago but exports had not maintained the strong growth of the previous
year, he explained.
Earnings per share were 327p (311p). There is a second interim dividend of
86p which makes 96p (90p) to date.

FT  07 APR 92 / UK Company News: Diploma takes over Anachem for Pounds 10.4m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DIPLOMA, the electronics, engineering and building components distributor,
is moving into the biomedical market with the Pounds 10.4m purchase of a 90
per cent stake in Anachem, a distributor of liquid chemical analysis
systems.
Mr Christopher Thomas, chairman, said yesterday that Anachem would fit into
Diploma's distribution philosophy, 'where the provision of high performance
service is dependent on commited quality management and staff'.
Diploma will dip into its cash pile of Pounds 26.7m - as reported at the
September 30 1991 year end - to pay for the acquisition.
A further payment of at least Pounds 1.3m could be due after three years to
Anachem's managing director for the outstanding 10 per cent.
Anachem distributes liquid chromotography systems - chemical methods of
analysing mixtures by passing the liquid along absorbant materials such as
chalk or paper. The liquid mixture will then separate as it seeps through.
The company's main customers are pharmaceutical and biotechnology
manufacturers, and research institutions.
Anachem reported profits of Pounds 2.2m for the year to September 30 on
sales of Pounds 11.8m. Net assets stood at Pounds 5.1m. Unpublished accounts
for the six months to March 31 showed a 5 per cent rise in sales on the same
period last year, and profits 'at least as high'. Anachem has Pounds 2.5m in
cash.

FT  07 APR 92 / UK Company News: Dewhirst rises 37% to Pounds 4.1m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DEWHIRST GROUP, the clothing and toiletries company, yesterday reported a 37
per cent improvement in pre-tax profits, from Pounds 3.02m to Pounds 4.13m,
for the year to January 17.
The increase was helped by the acquisition last year of the Slimma
womenswear business and the recovery from a poor group performance in 1990.
The company, which sells 82 per cent of its production to Marks and Spencer,
reported its first improvement in profit margins since the early 1980s. 'At
3.6 per cent, we are starting now to go the right way, and this was achieved
despite worsening trading,' said Mr Scott Beattie, finance director.
He said the recovery had come largely because the heavy cost-cutting and
closures of the previous year had 'done their duty'.
Turnover recorded a small recovery to Pounds 130.5m (Pounds 121.6m) and the
proposed final dividend of 0.43p was a 23 per cent improvement on last time
and makes a total of 0.72p (0.64p) for the year.
This should be set against the halving of the dividend in 1990, the first
time it had been cut in the company's 72-year history as a quoted concern.
The company was positive on current trading. 'Sales for the first 10 weeks
are ahead of the equivalent period last year,' it said. The shares firmed
1/2 p to 28p.
The acquisition of Slimma from Coats Viyella last September had been
slightly earnings enhancing, said Mr Tim Dewhirst, chief executive. The
company had made a Pounds 7.7m rights issue at 26p a share to pay for
Slimma, and the broader shareholder base limited earnings per share to 2.71p
(2.14p).
The company was cash generative and ended the year with Pounds 3.8m (Pounds
2.8m) net cash. Net interest payable fell to Pounds 711,000 (Pounds
920,000).
In July, Dewhirst made an abortive takeover attempt for Kingsgrange, the
toiletries supplier.
It cost Pounds 240,000 and was expressed as an extraordinary item, much less
than the previous year's Pounds 1.85m in closure charges.
COMMENT
Dewhirst has not been among the star performers in the textiles sector for
many years. Yesterday's results hold out a glimmer of hope that the good
times might return in the form of a strong balance sheet and the progress of
the Slimma acquisition. Slimma has done Dewhirst a power of good in the
shape of new management blood, a reduction in the company's dependence on
the depressed menswear market and yet closer ties with Marks and Spencer.
This should help profits continue their recovery in the current year,
perhaps as far as Pounds 6m. The stock is on a prospective multiple of 9.3,
a tempting discount to the market of about 20 per cent. The company imports
only about 16 per cent of its clothes and has the option of increasing this
to boost margins. If Dewhirst stays in M and S' good books, and shoppers
remain loyal to the retailer, the shares look good value.

FT  07 APR 92 / UK Company News: Fund managers form joint venture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HENDERSON Administration and Gartmore Investment Management, the fund
management groups, yesterday announced the formation of a joint venture to
administer their unit trust businesses.
The move is seen as a sign of growing pressure on the profitability of fund
management companies which have faced heavy competition and slow growth in
the unit trust and pension fund businesses. The venture will allow the two
companies to seek a new source of fee income.
The venture, named The Administration Partnership, will seek additional work
administering the unit trust businesses of other fund managers. Currently,
there is only one significant marketer of so-called back office services for
the unit trust industry, and most fund managers administer their own funds
internally.
The venture, expected to take a year to complete, will be 51 per cent owned
by Gartmore and 49 per cent by Henderson. It will have 184,000 unitholders
and Pounds 3bn under management and will be formed as Gartmore spins off its
existing administration facility with 75 staff.
Henderson has no unit trust facilities and has used third-party
administrative services for some time.

FT  07 APR 92 / UK Company News: Convenience stores behind advance to Pounds
13.4m at T&amp;S
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
T&amp;S STORES yesterday announced a 10.7 per cent increase to Pounds 13.4m in
pre-tax profits for the year to December 31 as depressed profits from
Supercigs, the tobacco retailing subsidiary, were more than offset by growth
from its expanding convenience store network. Profits from property
disposals amounted to Pounds 550,000.
Mr Kevin Threlfall, chairman, said he was 'delighted' with the results
since, he estimated, 'footfall' or throughput on Britain's high streets fell
by some 8 per cent from the previous year.
T&amp;S, which operates 583 tobacco, newsagent and convenience stores in the UK,
said the slump in consumer spending forced the company to cut cigarette
prices at Supercigs, where operating profits fell 1.9 per cent to Pounds
3.85m.
But convenience stores, which became a priority after the 1989 purchase of
Dillons and Preedy from Next, increased sales by 63 per cent to Pounds 52.1m
and lifted operating profits 95 per cent to Pounds 3.15m.
The number of stores almost doubled to 86 and margins were lifted by central
distribution and expanded purchasing power.
The group's 285 confectionery, tobacco and newsagent stores (or CTNs) lifted
operating profits nearly 20 per cent even though sales were ahead only 2.6
per cent. During the year the company's Fantasia 'pick 'n mix' confectionery
line was introduced to roughly one in five CTNs.
Group turnover increased 11 per cent to Pounds 314.2m (Pounds 283.1m).
Earnings improved 14.9 per cent to 15.71p (13.67p), helped by a lower tax
charge. The directors are recommending a final dividend of 3.25p to make a
total dividend of 5.5p, a 10 per cent increase.
COMMENT
T&amp;S's shares have suffered of late, falling from 220p two weeks ago to 193p
yesterday, a 6p fall on the day in spite of results slightly ahead of
expectations. The gloom probably stems from fears about the company's
minimum wage, which at Pounds 3.08 is well below Labour's pledge of Pounds
3.40. Any forced upwards revision would be damaging to T&amp;S's low margin
businesses, and could only be mitigated by sharply improved productivity, a
question the company is already trying to address. Longer term, growth will
have to come from convenience stores and Mr Threlfall is sticking to his
plan to increase the number of these outlets to 250 in the next couple of
years. While the strategy appears sound, achieving that level of growth will
probably require another sizeable acquisition. Forecast profits of Pounds
14m give about 12 times earnings. After rising 52 per cent last year, the
shares may need to consolidate further.

FT  07 APR 92 / UK Company News: Highland Distilleries dips 2.5% as whisky
sales volume falls
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP RAWSTORNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HIGHLAND Distilleries yesterday reported a 2.5 per cent dip in pre-tax
profits, from Pounds 15.1m to Pounds 14.7m, in the six months to the end of
February as volume sales of Scotch whisky were hit by the recession.
The results surprised the City which had been forecasting profits of about
Pounds 16.4m. The shares lost 11p to end the day at 259p.
Group operating profits fell 9 per cent to Pounds 11.8m, compared with
Pounds 12.9m. However, the pre-tax result was helped by increased net
interest income of Pounds 1.96m, against Pounds 1.16m, a rise of 67 per
cent. Investment income was a lower at Pounds 911,000 (Pounds 987,000).
Mr John Goodwin, Highland chairman, said the fall in profits was because of
lower sales of new and mature whisky to blenders who had reduced their
orders as industry volumes fell 7 per cent in the UK and 2 per cent in
export markets.
The contribution from Famous Grouse, the UK's second-best selling Scotch
brand which accounts for half the group's profits, had held steady, Mr
Goodwin said.
Industry sales of bottled whisky in the UK had fallen 12 per cent over the
six months to the end of February and competitors' prices were discounted
during the Christmas period.
However, Famous Grouse had maintained its premium pricing and margins and,
though suffering some decline in volume, had increased market share from 13
per cent to 14 per cent.
Export growth of Famous Grouse was continuing, Mr Goodwin said. Volumes rose
7 per cent and the value of export sales increased 21 per cent.
The brand has benefited from a distribution deal with Remy Cointreau in 1990
which linked it with Krug and Heidsieck champagnes and Remy Martin cognac.
When the deal was signed, exports of Famous Grouse accounted for only 27 per
cent of total sales. The proportion has now risen to 40 per cent.
Mr Goodwin said: 'We remain confident about the medium and long-term growth
prospects.'
Industry analysts underlined that view by downgrading full-year forecasts
from Pounds 29m to Pounds 28.5m, putting the company on a prospective p/e of
17.5, still a substantial premium to the market.
Turnover improved by a little more than 1 per cent from Pounds 95.6m to
Pounds 96.8m. The pre-tax figure was struck after a higher depreciation
charge of Pounds 828.000 (Pounds 683,000).
Lower tax of Pounds 4.78m (Pounds 5.23m) and minorities this time of Pounds
291,000 left earnings per share lower at 7.7p, compared with 7.9p. The
interim dividend is increased 5 per cent to 1.45p.

Kingspan Group, an Irish based and USM-traded maker of steelwork for
buildings and metal doors and windows, reported a decline in pre-tax profit
from IPounds 3.6m to IPounds 2.6m (Pounds 2.44m), in 1991.
The final dividend is 1.2p for a same-again total of 2.2p, although earnings
per share declined from 11.7p to 7.5p.
At the halfway mark the profit drop was 12 per cent, but directors said
there was no reason to believe the UK market had bottomed out and warned
that margins could be expected to remain under pressure.

FT  07 APR 92 / Whitbread takes charge for pub debts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP RAWSTORNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHITBREAD, the UK brewer and retailer, yesterday announced its 1991-92
after-tax profits would be reduced by Pounds 25m because of 'abnormally
high' charges for bad debts among its loans to recession-hit pubs and bars.
At the same time, the group said it will not invest further in the Pizza Hut
franchise in France, Belgium and the Netherlands, which had been seen as an
area of growth.
The double blow to the group's retailing business knocked 19 1/2 p off
Whitbread's shares which closed at 358 1/2 p. Analysts revised their
estimates of pre-tax profits from Pounds 260m to Pounds 223m-Pounds 230m.
Mr Peter Jarvis, Whitbread's chief executive, warned five months ago that
the risk of bad debts among its free trade customers - then estimated at
about Pounds 10m - was worsening due to lower consumer spending and the fall
in property prices.
After a review of Whitbread's Pounds 250m loan portfolio, Mr Jarvis said
yesterday, it had been decided an exceptional charge of Pounds 37m would be
needed to cover bad debts. This would reduce after-tax profits  - which
totalled Pounds 151.5m last year - by Pounds 25m.
About 3,000 of its 11,000 free trade customers are experiencing
difficulties. Most of the accounts at risk were opened during the late 1980s
when Whitbread sought new business as property prices were soaring and beer
volumes grew rapidly.
Whitbread's decision not to invest further in the European franchise
development of Pizza Hut, the PepsiCo-owned pizza chain, had been taken
'with regret', Mr Jarvis said.
Whitbread and Pizza Hut International had been unable to agree revisions to
their franchise agreements which Whitbread considered were necessary to
safeguard the long-term interests of its shareholders.
The 45 outlets in France, Belgium and the Netherlands make little
contribution to profits, but were seen as an important source of growth.
'Expansion required a huge investment and we were unable to obtain
satisfactory terms for recovering those assets if at any time we wanted to
quit the business,' said Mr Jarvis.
The two companies are exploring alternative ownership arrangements and
remain committed to their joint venture in the UK which operates 300 Pizza
Hut outlets.

FT  07 APR 92 / IBES forecasts upturn in profits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STOCK MARKET analysts have again cut their profits forecasts for 1992 for
companies in the seven leading economies, according to the IBES research
service, based in New York.
The IBES survey was carried out at the end of March by adding together
thousands of individual company earnings forecasts from analysts around the
world. Initial estimates from analysts are often over-optimistic, and
downwards revisions are common.
The biggest drop came in Japan and the UK, where profits forecasts have been
revised downwards since December by 9 per cent. The downward revision for
Canada was 7 per cent; for France and the US, 5 per cent; for Italy 3 per
cent; and Germany 2 per cent. However, in most countries, 1992 is still
forecast to show a strong earnings upturn from a poor 1991.
As the table shows, earnings growth of well above 20 per cent is forecast in
Canada, the UK and the US. Only Japan is expected to show a drop in
earnings, of 11 per cent, in the year that ends in March 1993.
The lower earnings figures apparently left the markets unaffected: at the
end of March price-earnings ratios based on forecast 1992 earnings were
higher or unchanged compared with the end of December in every country but
Japan. The Japanese p/e is calculated using earnings figures to March 1993.
A higher p/e ratio is usually taken to mean that stock prices are more
'expensive' than they were.

FT  07 APR 92 / Surprise shake-up at GM as Smith replaces Reuss
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GENERAL MOTORS last night surprised the US automotive industry by promoting
Mr Jack Smith, once head of its European operations, to be president and
chief operating officer of the company. He replaces the widely-criticised Mr
Lloyd Reuss, who has been moved to a less powerful position.
The move places Mr Smith in a strong position to replace Mr Robert Stempel,
the chairman, whenever he should retire.
Mr Reuss, a long-time close colleague of Mr Stempel, has been appointed
executive vice-president in charge of new vehicles and systems. Mr Reuss's
new job includes responsibity for developing electric vehicles and Saturn,
the compact car being built using new manufacturing techniques.
Mr Reuss had been criticised for not adopting a tougher approach to GM's
problems in the North American market. Mr Stempel had reportedly come under
pressure from institutional investors and some board members to replace him.
Mr Smith, formerly head of GM's international operations, will now also take
charge of all the company's North American vehicle and component
oper-ations. The company said the aim was to integrate more fully GM's North
American and international vehicle operations to accelerate a return to
profit in North America.
The company's US operations have been losing money heavily for the past two
years, because of recession and severe price competition, while
international operations have been reaping large profits, particularly in
Europe.
The company announced a restructuring plan in December which will involve
the closure of 21 plants, the loss of more than 70,000 jobs and an upheaval
of the management structure of the US business. Mr Smith will take Mr
Reuss's place as head of the strategy board overseeing this reorganisation.
The company said the changes would 'promote the adoption of best practices
throughout the corporation, such as the operating techniques which have
proven so successful for GM's international operations'.

PORTUGAL yesterday cut its two key interest rates and sold escudos on
currency markets to ensure that the Portuguese unit did not hit its ceiling
in its first day of trading on the European exchange rate mechanism (ERM).
The move by the Bank of Portugal, aimed at reducing the attraction of
escudos for foreign investors, also helped to lift pressure on sterling in
the tense period before the UK general election on Thursday. The escudo is
heavily in demand from investors because of Portugal's high interest rates.
Yesterday, sterling gained a quarter of a pfennig against a slightly
stronger D-Mark, closing in London at DM2.8375. At this level it is more
than 5 pfennigs above its ERM floor of about DM2.78. Last week the pound,
the system's weakest member, came under pressure amid nervousness about a
possible change of UK government. The Bank of Portugal reduced its top
intervention rate at which it injects liquidity into the money market by 1
percentage point, to 17.9375 per cent.
As well as selling escudos for pounds and D-Marks, the bank shaved to 15.375
per cent the rate at which it drains cash from the market, a drop of a
quarter of a percentage point.
These actions had their desired effect of pushing the escudo to a close of
85.86 against the D-Mark. This was higher than the central ERM rate of
86.94, but lower than the rate earlier in the day when the escudo had been
pushed to 85.57 against the German unit.
The escudo, like the pound and the Spanish peseta, trades in a wide, 6 per
cent ERM band. Even though the Portuguese unit is generally thinly traded,
an increase in value to near its upper limit could jeopardise sterling's
position.
Portugal's interest rate cuts - and the expectation of further reductions -
will go some way towards meeting criticisms from Portuguese industry that
growth prospects are being hit by high borrowing costs. The cuts are likely
to be considered by some as insufficient to compensate for the loss of
competitiveness from the escudo's high value.
Mr Anibal Cavaco Silva, the prime minister, said future interest rate
movements would depend on the market, adding that they were likely to fall
'some percentage points in the course of the year'.
The escudo's ERM entry, agreed at the weekend, means all the European
Community currencies, except the Greek drachma, participate in the system.
Mr Luis Nogueira, an analyst at Finantia, the merchant bank, said: 'Until
now, bringing down inflation was a goal. Now there is no question that it
has to be brought under control. Interest rates are also likely to fall
faster than expected.'
The escudo joins the FT's table of EMS currencies from today. The table,
published daily, includes ecu central rates, each currency's spread against
the weakest currency, and EMS divergence indicators.

FT  07 APR 92 / Steep fall in new car sales
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UK NEW vehicle sales fell steeply in March as tax cuts introduced in last
month's Budget failed to halt the industry's 2 1/2 -year recession.
Car registrations fell by 15.2 per cent and commercial vehicle sales by 11.5
per cent from the same month a year ago. This was in spite of the
chancellor's measures to help the industry, notably by halving the rate of
special car tax from 10 to 5 per cent.
The figures are not as bad as they seem, however, since sales for last March
were distorted by advanced purchases ahead of the increase in VAT.
Nevertheless, new car sales this March suffered the 29th consecutive monthly
year-on-year fall, while new commercial vehicle sales were 44.4 per cent
lower than three years ago.
Mr Gordon Brown, Labour's trade and industry spokesman, claimed the figures
confirmed that 'Britain is still stuck in recession with the Conservatives
unwilling to take the action necessary to ensure recovery.'
Carmakers remain uncertain about the underlying sales trend, with demand
distorted by important tax changes in the last two Budgets and consumer
confidence at a low ebb in the run-up to Thursday's general election.
Mr Ian McAllister, chairman of Ford of Britain, said first-quarter car sales
were only slightly down on the depressed level of last year's final quarter.
Sales in the first three months this year were running at a seasonally
adjusted annual rate of 1.46m, but Ford forecasts a recovery in demand, with
new car sales for the full year of 1.65m-1.7m against 1.59m last year.
'This year sales were sluggish ahead of the Budget, and the welcome boost
from the chancellor's reduction of car tax has now been counteracted by
uncertainty over the general election,' said Mr Geoffrey Pelling, general
manager of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders.
Mr Geoffrey Whalen, chief executive of Peugeot Talbot, said he was confident
that car sales had 'now bottomed out'.
Imported cars accounted for 57.3 per cent of the UK new car market in March
against 54.7 per cent a year ago.

FT  07 APR 92 / Gains by far right in Germany lead main parties to
collaborate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GERMANY'S mainstream parties, shocked by far-right gains in weekend
elections, yesterday prepared to collaborate in a bid to restore their
credibility. They also want to break the deadlock over legal reforms and
efforts to revive the economy of the former East Germany.
Chancellor Helmut Kohl invited the opposition Social Democrats (SPD) to
talks after Easter to discuss federal finances and changes to political
asylum laws. Mr Bjorn Engholm, the socialist chairman, called for a
'national commonsense pact'.
Both leaders were snubbed by the electorate in Sunday's polls. The far-right
Deutsche Volksunion (DVU) won six state parliament seats in
Schleswig-Holstein, where Mr Engholm is prime minister, cutting his majority
to one.
In Baden-Wurttemberg, a Christian Democrat stronghold for 20 years, the
extremist Republicans took 15 seats, robbing Mr Kohl's party of control of
its last west German state.
Ruling out power-sharing, Mr Kohl stressed that he wanted to discuss the
issues with socialist leaders from federal, state and local parties. His
main concerns are the need to stiffen asylum laws and to persuade the mainly
socialist state governments to increase their contributions to supporting
eastern Germany.
More than 250,000 asylum seekers entered Germany last year, and 35,000
arrived last month alone. At present the federal budget bears virtually all
the costs of propping up the eastern economy. Transfers from Bonn this year
are expected to exceed DM180bn (Pounds 63.1bn).
Mr Engholm was less specific, and claimed that one party could not handle
all the problems the country faced. 'When you see the problems we have in
Germany - DM1,500bn in debt, housing shortages and long-term difficulties
building up east Germany - it is not easy to solve,' he said.
According to Mr Kohl, the federal constitution must be changed to control
the influx of asylum-seekers - a move so far firmly resisted by the SPD and
the chancellor's FDP liberal allies in the coalition.
The jubilant Republicans and DVU, which had canvassed almost exclusively on
the asylum issue, linking it with economic concerns over housing,
unemployment and crime, went to ground yesterday. The DVU, reckoned to be
the more extreme of the two, now has seats in 13 of Germany's 16 state
parliaments.
Polling analyses showed that they had attracted votes from both main
parties, particularly among young, working-class men living in large towns
and cities.
The Infas social science institute said the weekend results showed a similar
pattern to those of the recent elections in France, where the establishment
was also shaken by far-right gains.
The main common features included: anxiety over economic well-being, a
tendency to blame foreigners and readiness to consider extremists as
alternatives to traditional parties.

Sirkka Hamalainen, first woman head of the central bank of Finland, passed a
testing day-one at the office yesterday calming the markka and markets
following turmoil unleashed by the sudden resignation of the previous
governor Rolf Kullberg.
Hamalainen, who has spent most of her working life at the central bank, is
sometimes said to be the only real man on its management board - all her
colleagues being politicians.
Given her predecessor's damaging tiff with the government about who was to
blame for the country's assorted financial woes, her critics claim her
non-political background may prove a handicap in forging crucial political
allies.
But it seems that Hamalainen has thought about that already. In a country
where much essential wheeling and dealing is still done in the sauna,
Hamalainen cannot exactly join the boys. That quintessentially Finnish
institution remains single sex.
However, the new governor, a firm advocate of sexual equality, belongs to a
ladies' sauna club whose members include a politician from the Centre Party,
the senior coalition partner, as well as the head of Helsinki's theatre.
Networking feminists elsewhere take note.

Meanwhile Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd faces an unlooked-for challenge for
his MP's seat at Witney in Oxfordshire. One of his constituency's council
members, Marilyn Brown, is standing against him on a 'Fair Trials Abroad'
ticket, accusing the foreign office of refusing 'to lift a finger' on behalf
of British victims of injustice abroad.
She admits a private interest in the topic. Her 28-year-old son Nicholas has
spent 15 months in prison in Goa, awaiting trial for possessing half an
ounce of cannabis - a charge his mother says is false but, even if true,
would scarcely warrant the 10 years' minimum sentence it carries.
She also insists that, in any event, her son's predicament is minor compared
with many worse examples over which the Foreign Office refuses to stir. To
which Hurd's response is that his department can involve itself only in
cases of 'manifest injustice'.
Even so, Foreign Office sources suggest that the electoral challenge may be
having an effect. A circular has gone round 'reminding' all embassies and
consulates to give the most careful attention to such cases.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Whatever a young man's fancy may be turning to this unsettled British
spring, the thoughts of top Treasury mandarins are turning inward. Even the
recession, which they are under fire for under-estimating, is taking second
place to their job security.
Labour voices have been direly hinting that, should their party win on
Thursday, the axe will fall on those sundry heads at Great George Street
that are deemed too closely associated with Conservative rule. And the
fiercest speculation centres on three former London Business School
economists.
One of them, tax expert Bill Robinson who took over last year as a political
adviser to Chancellor Lamont, is tipped for the chop instanter - a fate at
least a shade unfair, since he has lots of ideas and is not even a Tory
supporter.
But the outlook seems brighter for the other two: the Treasury's permanent
secretary Sir Terry Burns, and his old friend Alan Budd ensconced last
September as the government's chief economic adviser.
True, both the 'B-men' are regarded with less than total esteem by some of
those with a say in Labour's economics strategy who would like Budd, at
least, replaced by an economist more overtly sympathetic to the party.
Names being bandied around include David Currie, head of the LBS's centre
for economic forecasting, and Oxford don Chris Allsop who, besides having
worked for the Bank of England, was on the shortlist for the chief adviser's
job last year.
But the Labour elite has plumped for the view that axing Burns and Budd
sharpish would set nerves on edge in financial markets, not to mention the
dangers of losing two wise heads Labour might need to see it through choppy
waters ahead.

FT  07 APR 92 / A tiger bares its claws in southern China: Guangdong
province, home of an economic reform experiment, is enjoying dynamic growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON HOLBERTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In Guangdong province, on the south-eastern coast of China, almost every day
brings a big deal - often involving foreign capital and always fuelling a
hectic pace of economic growth.
Yesterday, the foreign participant was GEC-Alsthom, the Anglo-French group,
which was awarded a Pounds 550m contract to build power stations in the
province. The plants will provide energy to help sustain an expansion in
which factories and office buildings are being built on every conceivable
bit of spare land, and roads are clogged by an endless stream of lorries
carrying goods to market.
Guangdong is the laboratory for China's experiment with economic
modernisation which started in 1978 after 30 years of Maoist central
planning. While the province is exceptional in present-day China, it
demonstrates the country's pent-up economic potential.
Throughout the 1980s industrial output in the province grew on average by
nearly 20 per cent a year. In 1991 it grew by 27 per cent over 1990. It now
accounts for 8.5 per cent of China's total industrial production, up from 7
per cent in 1989.
As a result, Guangdong has been transformed from a predominantly
agricultural economy to an industrial power house, mainly producing goods
such as washing machines and refrigerators for the internal Chinese market,
and textiles and toys for export.
Much of Guangdong's rapid growth has resulted from the programme of economic
reforms implemented by the leadership in Beijing since the 1970s. In
particular, Guangdong was granted two of the country's original four special
economic zones, which have privileges such as the right to offer foreign
companies tax holidays of up to five years and reduced taxes thereafter.
The two special zones in Guangdong - Shenzhen and Zhuhai - are located on
the northern borders of Hong Kong and Macao, respectively. As a result, they
have easy access to foreign capital and international trading centres.
Last year, Guangdong received 45 per cent of the total foreign investment
which flowed into China from Hong Kong, Taiwan, Japan and western
industrialised nations. The majority was directed to Guangdong's export
industries, which already account for 19 per cent of the country's total
exports.
Geography has provided additional advantages to the province in its process
of economic development:
It is situated in one of China's most fertile regions which enables it to
produce two crops of rice in the summer and one of wheat in the winter.
During the 1950s and 1960s, China's economic planners, fearing aggression
from the US and Taiwan, located only a small part of the country's giant
state-owned industries in the southern coastal provinces. As a result, the
region is now relatively untroubled by the problems facing the rest of
industrial China which has the Sisyphean task of reforming inefficient and
indebted state-owned companies.
But while Guangdong's economy is relatively free from the burden of China's
industrial past, its rapid growth is presenting new problems. In particular,
economic growth has unleashed forces which China's leaders may not be able
to control. A hybrid form of capitalism/socialism is being created so that
the Communist party's doctrine of 'Socialism with Chinese characteristics'
is looking suspiciously like capitalism with Chinese characteristics.
The clearest example of this is the stock exchange in Shenzhen. Some 200,000
households in Shenzhen own and trade shares. The rows of brand new Mercedes
and top-of-the-range Toyotas in company car parks also attest to the new
thinking that 'Socialism with Chinese characteristics' has ceased to mean
even the appearance of egalitarianism.
This change in attitudes is reflected in the Communist party itself. 'The
role of the party is to make profit,' said one senior executive of a malting
factory outside Guangzhou, the capital of the province, in a statement which
would make Chairman Mao turn in his grave.
One former local party secretary, who held his post between 1964 and 1984,
commented: 'In 1984 I realised that all I had been doing for 20 years was
mouthing empty words.'
The weakening adherence to traditional Communist party doctrines has been
mirrored by a reduction in Beijing's power to control affairs in the
province. Having relaxed the reins of control, the central government is not
going to be able to pick them up again easily.
For instance, the central government's attempt to slow economic expansion
during 1988-90. Although the policy of 'rectification and retrenchment'
achieved its desired goals, at a national level, of bringing inflation down
from 40 per cent to less than 10 per cent, Beijing's calls met with only
lip-service in Guangdong.
In Shunde county, one of the richest in the province and the whole of China,
local authorities defied Beijing's strictures and went ahead with the
construction of a refrigerator factory during 1990. Trading under the name
Rongsheng, the factory's managers pushed ahead with plans to expand annual
capacity from 400,000 units to 600,000 units a year.
As Mr Wu Xiu Hao, a county official, noted with ill-disguised pride: 'The
refrigerator factory was built during those hard years, but we built it in a
secret way. When comrade Deng Xiaoping visited Shunde on January 29 he said
we were right to do what we did. He appreciated how bold we had been.'
Deng, the country's paramount leader, is squarely behind the economic
reforms which have sparked Guangdong's development. During his journey to
southern China he outlined in the starkest terms the consequences for
China's political elite of going slow on reform.
'If we do not carry out reform and opening, do not develop the economy and
do not improve the people's livelihood, then there will only be the road to
ruin,' he wrote in what is known as Central Committee Document No 2 - a
document he has used to foster speedier economic reforms throughout China.
'The common people will not allow anyone to change (these) principles and
policies; those who do this may be overthrown at any time.'
In policy battles since, at the top echelons of the country's ageing
leadership, Deng and his reformers appear to have emerged victorious. Last
week, a session of the National People's Congress endorsed plans to
accelerate the process of modernisation, while party newspapers have called
for '100 years of reform'.
Such proclamations are music to the ears of Guangdong's provincial party and
government leaders, who have bold plans to turn the entire province into a
special economic zone. With economic reform again a priority in Beijing,
they may be granted their wish. Guangdong would then be hard to stop in its
drive to join the ranks of South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Singapore,
east Asia's four tiger economies.

FT  07 APR 92 / Leading Article: After the peseta, the escudo effect
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE EUROPEAN exchange rate mechanism has become the only monetary policy
game in Euro-town. Portugal's decision to join the ERM over the weekend,
initially on wide bands, confirms the political importance now attached to
membership. Economically, the Portuguese government's decision to give up
its independent monetary policy is risky and could be highly costly.
Politically, in the current European environment, it had little choice.
The motivation behind the government's decision is a desire to meet the
Maastricht convergence rules and join Emu at its inception. Portugal's
consumer price inflation has eased in recent months but, at over 8 per cent
a year, remains twice as high as inflation-obsessed Germany. To join Emu in
1997, it must halve its current inflation rate, shave more than 2 percentage
points off the fiscal deficit as a share of gross domestic product and move
to narrow ERM bands by 1995.
Whether five years of austerity make sense for the EC's second poorest
country is questionable. EC membership has delivered rapid economic growth,
rising foreign direct investment and large-scale EC transfers without ERM
membership or German-style inflation. Moreover, the current European
environment may change. If Germany's economic and political difficulties
persist and the timetable for monetary union is postponed, slow growth in
socialist France and post-election Britain may become too much to take.
Clear imperative
Yet unless Emu is shelved the political imperative for smaller countries
like Portugal is clear: if they want to be good Europeans, especially in the
eyes of the Commission, they must knuckle down. No-one is sure where
following the Pied Piper of Brussels will lead; but no-one wants to be left
behind.
Nor is there any theoretical reason why Portuguese incomes should not
continue to catch up with the rest of Europe either within the ERM or in a
monetary union. The US South has been doing so for the past 100 years. What
would slow this real convergence is if the transitional cost of reducing
Portugal's inflation rate to European levels turned out to be high.
The economic rationale for ERM entry is that it will reduce the costs of
nominal convergence by making monetary policy more credible and guiding
expectations towards the low-inflation goal. But the ERM brings costs too.
For Portugal, the problem of divergence between the need for low interest
rates in Europe and Germany's tight monetary policy is not a concern. That
the escudo shot to the top of its wide bands yesterday, prompting an
interest rate cut, suggests that, like Spain, the Bank of Portugal's
difficulty may be undesirably low interest rates.
Slow adjustment
The more serious risk is that Portugal's wage and price adjustment will be
slow and incomplete. The longer the period of above-average wage inflation,
the more serious the squeeze on the competitiveness of the traded goods
sector and the more painful the eventual re-adjustment in the absence of
exchange rate re-alignments, as the UK, Italy and Spain are currently
discovering.
Portugal starts with some advantages: its unemployment rate is a mere 4 per
cent and the OECD calculates that the unemployment cost of reducing wage
inflation is also low by European standards. Nor does Portugal have a
structural trade problem. The current account deficit last year was very
small and more than offset by inflows of foreign direct investment. Yet this
small deficit masks a large trade deficit of 11 per cent of GDP in 1991.
This was offset by tourist earnings and income transfers from migrant
workers neither of which can be relied upon to keep on growing.
Portugal's decision is admirably ambitious. But every country that has taken
the ERM path to low inflation pays a price in lost output and higher
unemployment. Portugal's recent growth record also suggests it has more to
lose. What the government must now do is to build a consensus around the
need for a rapid fall in wage inflation across the entire economy. The
alternative route to European levels of wage inflation, via rising
unemployment, is long and painful, as current UK experience testifies.

FT  07 APR 92 / The right creeps through the cracks: The asylum issue has
dealt a blow to the German coalition
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Just up the road from Hamburg, Germany's richest city, lies Itzehoe, an
average sort of place, a swampy socialist stronghold close to the Elbe
estuary. In 1988, 72 per cent of the population turned out for the
Schleswig-Holstein state elections and 72 per cent of them delivered their
votes to the rising Mr Bjorn Engholm, soon to be the Social Democrats'
national leader. A drubbing for the Christian Democrats was par for the
course.
Last weekend, only 48 per cent of the local electorate troubled to vote.
With neat, if depressing, symmetry, about the same measly proportion chose
the SPD. Almost 20 per cent shared out their votes between the extreme
right-wing Republicans and the German People's Union (DVU).
The reason is to be found just down the road from Itzehoe, in Oelixdorf, an
ancient suburb chosen by the Schleswig-Holstein state government as its main
clearing centre for asylum-seekers.
Every day, Oelixdorf and communities throughout the federal republic are
obliged to take in, feed, transport, house and often clothe increasing
numbers of people fleeing war, economic hardship and the other forms of
oppression known to man. Last year, Germany's liberal asylum laws obliged
the country to let in 256,112 such people. Ten years ago the total was
49,391. Last month alone, according to the federal asylum office's
meticulous arithmetic, 35,059 arrived on the doorstep.
Yesterday, Chancellor Helmut Kohl and Mr Engholm, the SPD's chosen one to
challenge for the chancellorship in the 1994 federal elections, picked up
their share of the bill. The SPD just held on to power in the Kiel
parliament, but saw its share of the overall vote slashed from 55 per cent
to 46 per cent. Meanwhile, in simultaneous elections in Baden-Wurttemberg,
Mr Kohl's CDU lost its absolute majority, held for 20 years. Stuttgart was
the last state capital in the old west Germany where the Christian Democrats
ruled alone. The DVU, with six seats in the Kiel state parliament, and the
Republicans, with 15 in Stuttgart, shared the spoils and became the
third-largest political groups represented in both assemblies.
For once the establishment parties were united. The result, they said
yesterday, was a blow, a tragedy, a catastrophe or worse for democracy. A
formal verdict on the consequences for democracy must wait until 1994, when
a rash of state and local polls, topped by federal elections in October,
will deliver a more determinate judgment on the Bonn bodgers.
The result was two black eyes, one for Mr Kohl and one for Mr Engholm. Above
all, the outcome reflected anger and disenchantment with mainstream
politicians, the paralysis of the muddlesome conservative/liberal federal
coalition and its loss of contact with the realities of life beyond Bonn,
the so-called Bundesdorf nestling by the Rhine.
The failure of the socialists to draw any advantage from the CDU's collapse
in Baden-Wurttemberg - in Pforzheim, for example, where the Republicans
picked up 18.5 per cent of the vote, the SPD's share fell from 34 per cent
to 28 per cent - amply demonstrates that the SPD offers no credible
alternative. Mr Engholm, who was pushed into accepting the party's
nomination as chancellor candidate before he was ready, has not yet taken a
firm enough grip on the party to break its old habits of tying itself in
ideological knots. With an estimated 40,000 members between them in all
Germany, neither the DVU nor the Replicans have the necessary clout to fill
the political gap.
Even so, by latching on to and linking up the 'fear' issues, shown up by
unfailingly accurate opinion polls - asylum-seekers, rising crime,
unemployment and housing shortages - they made their mark at the weekend. Mr
Franz Schonhuber, Republican leader, who describes his party as 'clearly
right of the centre', campaigned hard on law and order, and an end to
immigration. His counterpart in the DVU, Mr Gerhard Frey, plastered
Schleswig-Holstein with leaflets proclaiming 'Germany should stay German'.
As yesterday's post mortem showed, they owed their success to city-dwelling,
working-class males under 30.
What the opinion samplers did not examine was the depth of the malaise which
produced the shock result. Asylum is only one - and far from the worst - of
the bogeymen stalking Germany. To many inhabitants, the federal republic has
become almost a foreign country: everything has changed. Unification
realised a politician's dream but brought with it 16m dependents, victims of
the earthquake which swept away the east German economy. The chancellor lied
when he said there would be no taxes to pay for unification, and then hit
everybody with a 7.5 per cent 'solidarity surcharge' on their income tax.
The collapse of European communism, another cause for celebration, quickly
soured as last year 200,000 ethnic Germans joined the influx of people
seeking asylum mainly from the former Soviet Union. Well over 1m east
Germans, still objects of profound suspicion in the old federal republic,
also migrated westwards. The economic slowdown is not a recession -
official. But in factories and offices where people are being told that they
should accept a virtual wage freeze for the next few years, it certainly
feels like one. And to top it all, as the headlines said, 'They are giving
away the Deutschemark]' in the interests of something called European unity.
As the mass circulation Bild newspaper remarked: 'Adieu stability.'
The lack of leadership, internal unity and stability has been apparent for
months in Bonn. The weekend's upsets show how far its effects have spread:
from the relatively poor 'fisheaters' in the north to the industrial
fatlands of Daimler-Benz country in the south.
Where is it all leading? To the conference table; first within individual
party headquarters. 'These are protest votes and all the major parties must
reflect and ask what we have done wrong,' said Mr Volker Ruhe, outgoing
general secretary of the CDU and incoming defence minister.
Then, according to yesterday's consensus, it will be time for all -
excluding the far right - to sit down together and hammer out a new working
relationship. As Mr Kohl has repeatedly said since the turn of the year,
Germany faces 18 months without elections, a period in which to draw up a
list of priorities and ways of dealing with them.
Hopefuls in the SPD have proposed a grand coalition in Bonn, but such ideas,
and even suggestions of a round table to plan 'rational-national'
strategies, have been ruled out by a chancellor refusing to allow the
weekend's shocks to loosen his grip on the reins of power. Mr Engholm claims
the problems confronting the country are too great and too urgent to be
dealt with in the confrontational atmosphere of the Bundestag, and Mr Kohl
acknowledges their scale and urgency. But he seems as much concerned with
maintaining his image as the strong man of German politics and dragging his
fractious opposition, as well as dissenters in the liberal ranks, into line,
and together finding a way through the current logjam.
His priorities, which he listed yesterday, may seem pedestrian in the light
of the mass of difficulties crowding in, but touch the heart of German
political sensibilities. He wants new laws to tighten controls over the flow
of asylum-seekers, a new system for funding the care of the elderly, and
adoption of new rules to make abortion more accessible. His demands
challenge principles held sacred by opposition, political allies and friends
alike. Proposals for these changes have been blocked for months by
opposition from within the SPD and even within coalition allies.
The SPD considers the constitution, which allows anyone asking for asylum to
be allowed into the country, inviolable. Where will the pressure for
amendments and infringements on people's liberties stop if the government is
allowed to change the country's basic law, they ask. Without co-operation
from the socialists the government has no chance of achieving the 75 per
cent majority needed in the Bundestag for constitutional change, and even
less of forcing an amendment through the SPD-dominated Bundesrat, the upper
house.
Members of the opposition and the minority coalition partners, the Free
Democrats, believe plans for self-funded systems under which people would
have to pay for nursing and attention in their old age are symptoms of a
conservative desire to dismantle the welfare state. On abortion reform, Mr
Kohl faces dour resistance from his cabinet colleagues in the catholic south
of the country.
At issue is the inflexibility of a socio-political system which is showing
signs of being unable to bear the burdens piled on it by politicians, labour
unions and history. The greatest of these, and a 'priority' often mentioned
by Mr Kohl in recent weeks but neglected yesterday, is the assimilation of
the former East Germany. At present virtually all the costs of unification
are being borne by the federal budget. All the popular resentment is
accumulating on Mr Kohl's shoulders.
If, as he says, he wants state budgets to take a greater share of the costs,
and the people of Germany to take home less real pay, expect less from the
mother-hen state, work longer hours and retire at 65 instead of 60, he is
going to have to show a measure of unaccustomed flexibility and to give
ground to opposition demands in return for concessions.
The present political framework was tested in a small way at the weekend
polls, and it cracked. Ugly and unwelcome, the far right crept out through
the gaps. The danger for Mr Kohl is that in 1994's elections the cracks
could turn into gaping chasms, swallowing up the 'Unification Chancellor'
and releasing even more unwelcome guests than showed up at the wake
yesterday.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
After Swan Lake, what? For those great dancers who left the security and
predictability of Soviet ballet, the West offered change and challenge - and
routine.
Makarova, Nureyev, Baryshnikov, in their very different ways, sought to
escape from the classic treadmill to which their gifts and their public
image condemned them.
For Mikhail Baryshnikov the need has been to reconcile what his dance genius
dictated - which was the most disciplined, yet the most ardently daring
ventures into classicism - with what must come after, when the wise artist
accepts that his gifts have changed physical gear.
Hence Baryshnikov's interest in the work of Mark Morris, most sympathetic
(because musical and imaginative in steps) of the new generation of
post-modern creators. For American Ballet Theatre, when Baryshnikov was its
director, came Morris's fluent Drink to me Only. With Morris, when he was at
La Monnaie in Brussels three years ago, Baryshnikov found a fascinating
persona as the tense private-eye of Wonderland. Lately the two men have
united in the White Oak Dance Project, a modern dance ensemble which
surrounds and complements Baryshnikov as performer, with Morris providing
the chief choreographic identity.
Its first London appearance on Thursday night was schizoid. The evening
began with the statutory 'introducing the company' romp. The audience - who
could not, surely, have been expecting the ci-devant Baryshnikov - see nine
dancers in undress of tee-shirts and black tights, thumping about in
Morris's little Canonic 3/4 Studies. These are tiny, laboured jokes in which
Baryshnikov looks like a monarch slumming, and worse is to come.
Rob Besserer is involved in a fatuous mime scene by Meredith Monk, and Carol
Parker, topless but in a tarlatan skirt, her face bandaged, is called upon
to impersonates a senile ballerina in Martha Clarke's vulgar Nocturne. It
contrives to be pointless, vulgar, and not a little offensive in its view of
ballet. Miss Parker, with exquisite tact, hides what her absence of bodice
might reveal.
The artistic indecision implicit in such items is further stressed by
Baryshnikov's part in Lar Lubovich's glutinous Concerto 622. This is the
ultimate Buddy-ballet, with two chaps being very, very supportive as the
slow movement of the Mozart clarinet concerto is sentimentalised by
cheap-jack dance.
It may not be accidental that after this unpleasant little incident,
Baryshnikov appears as the Penitent in Martha Graham's El Penitente. He
makes handsome amends for what has gone before. The staging, with its
austere Noguchi design, is serious. Terese Capucilli (from the Graham
company) and Kenneth Tosti are very good as the Woman and the Christ-figure,
and Baryshnikov's concentration, his sense of contrition, are ideal.
Ideal, too, his appearance in Morris's Ten Suggestions. These are lightning
sketches set to Tcherepnin piano bagatelles. When Morris danced them - and
danced them brilliantly - the emotional opulence of his presence and the
pink satin pyjama-suit he wore, gave the piece a slightly faisande air.
Baryshnikov brings something both innocent and dazzlingly sure to his
performance.
The pink satin looks in no way ambiguous; the stunning control of
Baryshnikov's dancing - tiny fast runs; falls that melt and move on - tell
better than anything else he does that he is still what he was: a uniquely
gifted dance artist. We see a physical command - a mastery and a freedom in
timing; a power to imbue the least action with drama in its dynamics - that
reveal Baryshnikov's art undiminished in its truth, still able to grip our
attention utterly by its visual and emotional force.
The evening ends with Morris's A Lake. In it he uses Haydn's second horn
concerto as a basis for dances that manipulate movement ideas with craft,
though formula seemed to me more evident than invention. It is carefully
made, rather self-conscious in its steps, as in its updated and hideous
rococo costumes, and shows Baryshnikov as minimally part of the team. In
this it reflects the identity of the whole evening - but without Baryshnikov
the programme would be insupportable. The management, incidentally, might
remember its duty to the public: a programme change was unannounced.

<TEXT>
Ruby Wax is rude, not suggestive-rude, but cantankerous-rude. She is
encouraged to be - she is a foreigner, an American. This allows her to play
the holy fool, asking the questions, drawing the conclusions, spilling the
beans about the most intimate parts of the human, and national, psyche.
Her one-woman show is an extended howl of outrage - just what her fans want
to hear. She is moaning from the start, as she wanders on to a set dominated
by a picture of her brightly provocative teeth, one of which is appositely
gold-capped. The theatre management is treating her badly  - no car, no
helpers, and a lavatory in her dressing room like the black hole of
Calcutta. Helpfully, she shows us a Polaroid of it.
The first half of the act stays devoted mainly to the bottom part of the
body. Much of it hits at the softest of targets - can there still be laughs
in bidets? - but sometimes she gets popular fads in her sights and scores a
bull's-eye - 'show me a vegan and I'll show you a face full of zits', she
promises.
Her graphic descriptions of the agonies of childbirth threaten to doom the
human race to extinction. At least she includes self-abuse in her repertoire
 -'when I was young we used to pout in the mirror to look like Brigitte
Bardot; I looked like Alfred Hitchcock'.
After the interval, the ground gets softer, as she picks apart her native
land, her childhood, her family. Here again the nuggets gleam: 'Americans
look as if douched with Perrier'. The line is delivered with appropriate
gestures. And that is one of Ruby Wax's strengths.
She is a very physical performer and when she lets loose on a castigation,
with arms flying, eyes bulging, body exploding, the effect is numbing.
She ends by blowing the most vigorous raspberries seen on the West End
stage. If her material is not a patch on the observations of the home- grown
comedienne Victoria Wood, Ruby Wax would certainly enhance, no dominate,
most stages as an actress.
Her show is discreetly directed by Alan Rickman, who might try to sharpen up
the first 20 minutes.
Ruby Wax was at the Globe Theatre, Shaftesbury Avenue, before a national
tour

FT  07 APR 92 / Arts: Hooked on motion - Alexander Calder's Moving Parts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM PACKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Alexander Calder retrospective, now in the Sackler Galleries at the
Royal Academy, comes to London from the Whitney in New York. Not over-large,
it celebrates - perhaps a shade too earnestly - a talent itself stretched a
shade too far. Such tends to be the American view of its own artists and
their masterpieces. Yet the decorative charm and engaging physical nature of
the works are undeniable, qualities reflected in the evident popularity of
the show. Calder remains after all that comparatively rare bird, a modern
and abstract artist of genuinely wide appeal.
His reputation rests on a single technical innovation, which is now the
commonplace of every nursery school, play-group and children's bedroom, the
suspended and counterbalanced mobile, swinging and twisting prettily to
every puff of air. Once established, however, the device proved to be one he
would work only in terms of elegant and colourful variation, rather than
actual formal development. Not for the last time, in American art
especially, did such formal limitation provide the key to the critical
pantheon.
Such was Calder's 'breakthrough into style', and nothing exposes its
creative inadequacies more cruelly than his attempts late in his career to
move back to a more conventional method and sculptural statement, static and
monumental. His reversion to what he called the 'Stabile' was a
master-stroke of self-presentation, capitalising wonderfully in a mere
syllable on what was by then his deeply ingrained success.
Yet here again is the same formula, only writ large and without benefit of
diversionary movement, the same amorphic silhouettes slotted and bolted
together to arch and stride across the floor.
The truth is that Calder was from the very first a derivative and
essentially graphic - which is to say two-dimensional - artist, albeit
blessed for the most part with an admirably light touch and graphic wit. The
determining influences are manifest, Cocteau, Arp, Gabo and Miro in
particular. They mark Calder as the eternal and unrepentant surrealist, for
all the abstract nature of his mature work.
Born in 1898, he had been in Paris in the late 1920s, living and working
within the ambit of the School of Paris, and forming several lasting
friendships. Though he was never resident for long, he was the one American
artist whose reputation survived the Great War who was openly and closely
associated with European modernism of the 1930s.
The earliest work indeed is as intriguing as any for the way in which it
toys with the sculptural possibilities of the graphic image. A portrait
head, a pair of acrobats, a prancing horse, for example, are all drawn in
wire very much in the manner of Cocteau's nervous sophistication.
With the head of Varese in particular, made in 1931, the face comes forward,
moving across and against the back of the head in hypnotic parallax, a
movement the more active for being implicit and induced.
Who knows where such playful openness may have led him, the more so when
combined with such figurative imagery? In the event it was to be the actual
physical movement that claimed him, for his first mobile dates from 1932,
and abstraction with it. The pattern was set.
Of what does the characteristic Calder mobile consist? A simple plane and
brightly coloured shape, occasionally geometric but usually vaguely organic,
leaf-like perhaps, is attached to a wire or rod and counterbalanced by
another, or instead fastened to another similarly encumbered at the point of
balance, and so by progression, the whole cranky and captivating structure
is built up. Room must be allowed for each arm to sway past its
neighbour-partner, the urge to test the possibility irresistible.
The elements thus shift constantly in their relation to each other, the
whole re-forming itself each instant. Nothing could be more charming or
diverting, like watching a tree wave in the wind, or gulls wheeling and
diving against the cliffs.
But here is the problem which Calder never resolved, and which faces all
artists who choose to introduce movement as an element and character of the
work. For in the end, the artist may be forced to accept that what engages
the viewer is not so much the work itself, but the movement alone, just as
the snake is transfixed by the sway of the pipe.
The test is quite simple: how dull these things are in their refinement when
finally at rest - as too often they are at the Academy, where the visitor is
not allowed to set them off again with a gentle touch.
What is left is but a demonstration of elegant and repetitive ingenuity. We
follow the scheme and principle of balance through the work like a map,
wonder at the articulation and contrived asymmetry, and relish at last the
oddities and improbabilities of gravity: but we hardly notice the work.
Calder's influence is clear enough, and movement in sculpture once
introduced is here to stay.
But it works only when the artist accepts that the movement itself is the
formal point, something not incidental but essential. It might be William
Pye experimenting with water in motion, but turn off the tap and there is no
sculpture; or George Rickey with his tall, precarious monuments to the wind.
Most spectacular of all were the works of Peter Logan that were recently in
London, occupying the Economist Plaza off St James's in the months either
side of last Christmas.
Whirling and turning in the gusting and eddying wind with a furious and
dangerous precision, these beautiful objects, in fact no more than posts
with mobile arms, held the imagination in endless fascination. The movement
was all.

FT  07 APR 92 / Management (The Growing Business): Financial stamp of
disapproval - Charles Batchelor describes one woman's struggle for
registration with a self-regulatory body
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Susan Reed wants to advise east European governments on how to fund their
privatisation programmes. She thought that the best way of going about it
was to register with the Securities and Futures Authority (SFA), which
regulates this type of activity.
But one year later and after wasting more than Pounds 5,000 in fees Reed has
decided that she no longer needs or wants their official approval.
If Reed's experience of trying to register with the SFA, one of four
self-regulatory bodies set up to improve investor protection under the
Financial Services Act, is typical, it reveals a system which places a very
heavy burden of red tape on the smaller business.
Her story suggests that the government's concern to protect investors has
led to the neglect of its stated objective of reducing the bureaucracy which
hampers business.
The small firm pays a heavy penalty in complying with a regulatory system
which has, in recent months, signally failed to prevent some very
large-scale frauds.
Reed decided to set up in business on her own after 19 years working in
international capital markets with companies such as Samuel Montagu and
Citicorp.
After being made redundant she spent two years training herself to use a
computer and run her own business.
She decided to set up an investment banking consultancy advising governments
in eastern Europe on how to finance their privatisation programmes. It was
not her intention to handle client's money and she would not be dealing with
the general public.
The diary of Reed's dealings with the SFA makes sobering reading:
February 1991. Reed enquires with The Securities Association (which two
months later becomes the SFA) whether she needs to register her consultancy,
Susan Reed &amp; Co. The TSA says it cannot advise and she must ask her own
lawyers.
April 1991. Her lawyers say she must register.
May 20. After Reed's accountants have spent a month reviewing the
documentation, Reed submits her application form.
May 23. Reed is given the impression by the SFA that her application appears
to be straightforward and it should only take 'a few weeks' before being
presented to the membership committee. She is asked to submit financial
projections.
Reed pays standard Pounds 2,000 application fee. The fee is the same whether
an applicant employs one or 1,000 people. It also is just Pounds 80 less
than the financial support Reed has received under the government's
Enterprise Allowance Scheme, designed to help unemployed people start up in
business.
June. Reed is sent a copy of the TSA rule book with a wad of amendments as
thick as the original volume. She spends four days reading and updating the
rule book.
July. After further work with her accountants, she submits financial
documents.
August 9. She attends a meeting of the SFA's enforcement department at which
her financial statements are reviewed.
August 23. The SFA informs Reed that her accountants are not registered with
the SFA to audit member firms. She must persuade them to register or find
another accountant. Reed's accountants, themselves a small firm, agree to
register but only because they have another client in a similar position.
October 24. SFA membership committee approves her application but - five
months after her initial approach - asks her to change the name of her
business. The SFA does not like a one-person business calling itself '&amp; Co',
she says. She suggests Susan Reed Securities but this is not acceptable
either.
October 21. An SFA official telephones to ask if Reed will send written
confirmation she has no debts.
October 25. The membership department agrees to put forward her application
under the original name.
November 7. Her application is approved. But when Reed receives written
confirmation she is horrified to discover she is listed only under the
section: 'to provide corporate finance advice'.
She had applied for a broader range of categories, including providing
advice and acting as an agent for debentures. She understands corporate
finance to involve advice on matters such as mergers and acquisitions.
November-December. The SFA sends a form which allows Reed to request a
change in her business profile. The form indicates that a revised profile is
valid from the date it is received by the SFA but a note attached to the
form says the SFA will send Reed a copy of the amended print-out of her
business profile.
January 31, 1992. Reed receives a bill from her accountant for work on her
SFA application. This prompts her to chase up the SFA. Reed, who has been
living off savings and money received under an insurance claim, says she has
not carried out any business in the meantime. She has become involved in
preparing other projects.
March 11. Reed loses patience and writes to the SFA, effectively renouncing
membership and asking for a refund of her application fee and legal and
accountant's fees. She also asks for compensation for the Pounds 50,000 in
lost earnings which she had projected for her first 10 months in business.
March 13. John Young, SFA chief executive, replies to Reed's letter saying
he can see no reason to make the refund. Reed says his letter does not
address the issue of the length of time taken to process the application.
The SFA says it cannot comment on a specific application but it does reply
to Reed in detail on March 30. Its record of events tallies in most respects
with Reed's but it points out that Reed or her accountants took a long time
to respond to requests for information. Once information was received it was
acted upon speedily, according to the SFA.
Reed would have been told at the initial meeting that applications took 12
weeks on average to process though some straightforward ones might take less
time, the SFA states.
It also finds it 'implausible' that Reed would wait so long after submitting
a revised business profile without checking to see whether it had been
received and whether she could start up in business.
But, leaving aside the time which passed after Reed submitted her revised
business profile, is a six-month wait unduly lengthy? After all, businesses
which attempt to raise venture capital finance may have to devote between
six and 12 months to the process. And is Pounds 5,000 too much to ask a
small business to pay to register?
The SFA registration process does appear onerous for the smaller business.
As Reed points out, much of the information involved financial projections,
the relevance of which, for registration purposes, seemed remote.
Suggesting, as the SFA does, that Reed delayed in responding to requests for
information seems to ignore the fact that it might take time to prepare.
And even if one set of procedures does not seem a heavy burden, businesses
have to deal with many different organisations each setting its own rules
and timetable.
Turning to the costs involved: City executives may earn more than their
counterparts in industry but, until recently, few earned the level of salary
which would allow them to write off Pounds 5,000 of start-up costs without
blinking.
Reed says she has now decided that she does not need the approval of the
SFA. 'If investors need to be protected this is not the way to do it,' she
says. 'I feel it is an abuse of power. Lots of people have been made
redundant in the City. The bureaucracy prevents them from applying their
skills.'

transputer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HOLDSWORTH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN INTERNATIONAL body has been formed to promote the use and development of
the Inmos transputer, the UK-developed 'computer on a chip', writes Ian
Holdsworth. The Transputer Consortium (TTC) picks up the baton from an
earlier scheme, the Transputer Initiative, which ended last week after
providing Pounds 2.9m of government funding to six regional transputer
centres at British universities over the last five years.
The new body, no longer funded by the government, will be a forum for
national user groups and suppliers of the transputer, a chip which is used
as a building block for making powerful parallel-processing computers.
The consortium aims to carry forward the earlier project's achievements.
'It's all about sharing experience and knowledge,' says Mike Jane, the
scheme's co-ordinator. TTC will develop and promote standards among users
and provide a mechanism for influencing funding agencies.
TTC has five founding members. Parsys, Parsytec, Transtech and 3L are
companies that sell transputer-based processors or software. The fifth
member is the chip's inventor, Inmos, a once-British company bought by the
French-Italian group SGS-Thomson in 1989.

FT  07 APR 92 / Technology: Strength in numbers - Charles Arthur describes
why British academics are working to unleash the power of parallel software
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES ARTHUR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If you wanted a wall built, would you hire a team of bricklayers, or would
you hire a sprinter like Carl Lewis and teach him to lay bricks? The answer
may seem obvious, but in computing, most companies with increasingly complex
problems - such as mapping air-flow over surfaces, determining what happens
in an engine cylinder or controlling large networks of computers - opt for
the latter approach, buying ever-faster machines which solve huge equations
a piece at a time.
The alternative, splitting up the problem and parcelling it out in parallel,
is both cheaper and in many cases quicker. However, conventional computing
has gone for the Carl Lewis (or serial) approach because parallel machines
are much more difficult to build and program. Also, users have so much
invested in their existing methods that they find it hard to justify
investigating an alternative.
Now, though, some of the UK's brightest academic computing brains have come
together in four new university centres around the country - in Southampton,
Edinburgh, Oxford and London - with the aim of finding industrial partners
for collaborative projects, and giving the UK a lead in developing parallel
software. It is not a trivial pursuit; many believe parallel systems will
eventually supersede conventional large-scale computers, as the amount of
data being processed outstrips the growth in conventional computer power.
The academics' first task is to persuade industry that they are serious.
'This is not a bunch of airy-fairy academics with Einstein haircuts,' says
Colin Upstill, director of Southampton University's parallel applications
centre, the first of the four to open in Britain last October. 'When I was
an undergraduate in the 1970s, some of the professors couldn't boil an egg.
But these are the new generation who are very sharp wheeler-dealers. The
economic climate of the 1970s and 1980s has driven them this way.'
In line with those climate changes, the centres' Pounds 13m of public
funding (Pounds 9m from the Department of Trade and Industry, and Pounds 4m
from the Science and Engineering Research Council) only lasts four years,
after which they must become self-financing. In the meantime, the industrial
partners are expected to spend Pounds 21m collaborating on the projects.
Upstill describes the scheme, and the collaborations it creates, as offering
an 'electronic wind tunnel' with 'extended test drives for industry'. The
universities benefit by gaining expertise, sharing intellectual property
rights and publishing some of their results. Meanwhile, companies lacking
the resources or expertise can try out parallel computing. 'Anybody with the
right money could buy the same equipment as we have,' he says. 'But on its
own that doesn't get results.'
However, persuading industry of that is still difficult. Bob McLatchie,
executive director of Oxford University's Parallel Centre (which opened for
business last month), says: 'Going to companies and saying: 'It's a coding
thing, we're good for you,' doesn't work. The ones that have joined us
recognise that they're in a fix. You have to identify a key, critical
problem.'
That has worked at companies including BP, Shell, BT, British Gas, Lucas
Aerospace, Sharp, British Aerospace and Unilever. The centres aim to add
more names to the list in the coming months.
Parallel computing does offer great opportunities. To return to the
wall-building analogy, if you wanted the wall built faster, you would hire
more bricklayers; in computing terms, this is a 'scaleable' problem. Most
computer-intensive tasks, such as weather forecasting, molecular modelling
and even database analysis are scaleable, and applying parallel processing
achieves impressive results.
Though there are an increasing number of parallel machines (often dubbed
'minisupercomputers') on offer, usually from US suppliers, skills in
parallel programming are still in desperately short supply. 'It's not like
programming a PC,' comments Kevin Collins, commercial manager at Edinburgh
Parallel. 'It's not a commodity industry at the software level.'
While the centres can boast an array of parallel machines - including the
Meiko 'computing surface' running the Oracle database, the Intel iPSC/860
parallel supercomputer and systems centred around the British-built (and now
French-Italian owned) Inmos transputer - the loyalty is to software and
ideas. The news that Inmos plans to close its factory in Wales and shift
production elsewhere provokes little response. 'If you told me Inmos would
move to France but the T9000 (the improved version of the transputer) would
appear tomorrow, I would say 'Great, go',' says one centre's manager.
Possibly the most interesting collaboration at Southampton is the one which
sounds most mundane; its ordinary nature disguises its wide applicability.
Few companies will have to carry out analysis of geosensory data like BP;
few will worry about combustion in a jet engine like Lucas Aerospace. But
all will have to handle growing amounts of data about customers and
suppliers.
British Gas is performing analysis and extraction trials on two dummy
databases, one of around 1 Gigabyte (1,000 Mbytes) which mirrors its
database on buying and selling gas from North Sea suppliers, and another of
about 5 Gbyte, which reflects the size of the one on nationwide sales of gas
to commercial premises. Currently they run on IBM mainframes and
minicomputers from Digital Equipment.
'We're intrigued by the claims that parallel machines can outperform
conventional mainframes by a factor of 50,' says Tony Fincham, consultant to
British Gas's maths and computing division. 'The benefits are that we could
do what we now do faster, and do more complex database operations. People
are always thinking of more elaborate ways to look at data, for example for
management information. And the applications are always eating up more
computer power.' If these trials work, the eventual target is the
corporation's customer service and billing database - which takes up a
mighty 12 Gbyte.
'By 2000, with advances in computer technology and optoelectronic and
telecoms technology, the hardware will be able to do anything. But the
problem will be programming, which is where we come in,' says Upstill.
To that end, all of the centres have brought in people from industry, often
at a high level. Collins worked for Parsys, which makes parallel machines.
Upstill, previously with Plessey, has hired programmers with commercial and
defence experience able to program and document code to BS 5750 (the British
Standards Institution quality assurance standard). 'That means they know
about commercial confidence and security. We are not amateurs,' he
emphasises.
The four-year deadline gives each centre an interest in being, or appearing
to be, pre-eminent. 'There are blue-chip customers and blue-chip
applications at stake,' Jackson says.
From 1996, the centres will be allowed to produce commercial software, and
might even be spun off as separate companies. 'We're not competing with
business or trying to put people out of work,' says Upstill. 'We want to
push this technology that the UK is good at.'

FT  07 APR 92 / Technology: Electronic voting out for the count -
Technically Speaking
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN British voters enter the polling booths on Thursday the closest they
are likely to come to high technology is a pencil sharpener. Television may
dominate the hustings, but electronics so far has no place in the polling
station or at the election count.
For 120 years, since the 1872 Ballot Act, voters in UK general elections
have cast votes in the same time-honoured way - by placing a pencil-mark
cross in a box on a ballot form next to the candidate of their choice and
then posting the slip through a slot in the top of a metal box.
At the end of polling day the ballot boxes are collected. In town halls and
public buildings all over Britain returning officers supervise the teams of
office workers who manually sort and count the votes for each candidate.
With a bit of luck the result will be announced in most constituencies
sometime around midnight.
Generally the system works reasonably well, if a little slowly. But in many
other parts of Europe - Germany, Portugal, Spain and Denmark, for example -
as well as North America, the system has been replaced in part, or totally,
by mechanical or electronic systems.
Should the UK modernise its system? Some parliamentarians think so. Earlier
this year the Commons Home Affairs Committee published a report which
suggested that a US-made automatic vote counter manufactured by American
Information Systems (AIS) should be tested in a parliamentary by-election.
The AIS machines are based on high-speed optical character readers (OCRs).
Voters mark a specially printed ballot form by filling in an oval or a
cross. The form is then placed in a ballot box and fed into the OCR after
the poll has closed.
In one process the machine can count and tabulate the number of ballot
papers in each box, the number of votes for each candidate and the total
votes cast. Ballot papers with incorrect marks are fed automatically into a
separate hopper for adjudication.
The machines are capable of reading 400 ballot papers a minute and cost
about Pounds 10,000 each. Based on the British general election in 1987 when
an average of 50,000 votes were cast in each constituency, one machine per
constituency would take about two hours to count the result, excluding
verification which takes about an hour and a half. This is about the same
length of time as a manual count, so to achieve real time savings it would
be necessary to use two or more machines per constituency.
OCR counters come into their own, however, when there are a large number of
candidates for different posts - in some American elections voters use the
same ballot form to vote for everyone from the town dog catcher to the
President.
In the UK similar OCR systems are used by the Electoral Reform Society to
count votes in complex trade union and other elections. The machines used by
the society can count about 5,000 ballot papers an hour and, according to
the society, are accurate and reliable.
This combination of speed and accuracy is a powerful selling point for OCR
vote counters, especially in elections such as the current British one where
victory margins could be extremely slim and lengthy recounts look likely.
There is also a good case for automating vote-counting when more than one
post is up for election, or when local, national and European elections
coincide, as is increasingly likely to happen in the future.
The UK Commons committee acknowledged that eventually it might make sense to
move to a fully electronic voting system - with electors pressing buttons or
touching a computer screen to make their choices.
Britain's electoral system may change in the next few years - with or
without the possible introduction of proportional representation. This, plus
the availability of the technology, should make electronic voting
irresistible.

FT  07 APR 92 / Satellite paging services opened
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HUTCHISON Paging and Mercury Paging are launching rival satellite-based UK
paging networks which they claim are a substantial improvement on the
present landline-based services.
Mercury Paging, a joint venture between Mercury Communications and Motorola
of the US, launched its satellite paging service at midnight on Sunday.
Hutchison's satellite service will begin tomorrow with an inaugural message
by Sir Bryan Carsberg, director-general of Oftel, the telecommunications
industry watchdog. Hutchison Paging is part of Hutchison Telecom UK.
The companies are launching the world's first satellite paging services,
which they say are faster and much more reliable than existing cable
services.
Satellite networks can avoid the corruption of messages resulting from
traffic congestion. Corrupt messages are a source of frequent complaints
from users of paging services.
Users of Mercury's service will automatically be switched to the satellite
service at no extra cost. Those using Hutchison's service will have to
switch over, but the cost of the new service is no more than that of the
present service.
The UK paging market has stagnated since reaching a plateau of about 670,000
users since 1990.
Hutchison said that improved service and greater reliability would change
consumers' perception of paging services.
It said: 'We aim to break the market open to a far wider audience, which in
turn will bring the price down.'
Hutchison added that independent research forecasts show the number of users
rising to nearly 1n by 1995.

FT  07 APR 92 / Supertram gets on the right lines: New funding has revived
an old idea
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN'S first supertram made its debut yesterday, carrying fare-paying
passengers after months of delay. Metrolink's first tram left Bury for
Manchester at 6am, carrying a total of 200 passengers and dignitaries.
The supertram is unique in Britain because, when fully operational, the
two-car trams will use conventional rail tracks as well as tramlines: taking
to the streets when they reach Manchester city centre. The trams will link
Manchester's Victorian rail termini, enabling a regional rail and tram
network to be developed as the system is extended over the next decade.
Railway safety inspectors gave the go-ahead last week for the tram's first
phase after engineering and training delays. The trams are expected to take
to the streets with fare-paying passengers in four weeks - the first to run
on tramlines since 1949, when Manchester scrapped its double-deck
'rattlers'. A third phase, running on railway tracks to Altrincham, will
open in May, with a city-centre spur between the high street shops and
Piccadilly station four weeks later.
Although there are less than than two miles of track running through
Manchester city centre, Metrolink is revolutionary because of the way it has
been managed politically and financed so as to minimise impact on public
funds. The key has been DBOM - 'design, build, operate and maintain'.
Politicians and public-transport authorities from throughout Britain, Europe
and the US are now studying it as a model for funding other public projects.
The scheme has resulted in quasi-privatisation of part of the public rail
network, but retaining public control. The system will be operated and
maintained by the same private-sector organisation that designed and built
it.
The operator is contracted to the regional public-transport authorities  -
in this case Greater Manchester Passenger Transport Executive, British Rail
and the city of Manchester - to provide and guarantee the service.
To win the Manchester contract, bidders had to come up with a scheme
requiring the smallest public subsidy, assuming balancing capital costs of
development and construction against revenues and profits from future
operations.
That differs markedly from the public sector's financing and eventually
running such a scheme, with contractors' responsibilities virtually ceasing
after building the infrastructure or supplying vehicles. The theory is that
if the designer-builder also has to operate and maintain the system, the
onus for quality runs through every stage of the process. In effect,
everything has been franchised out. Greater Manchester owns the rails, but
does not control the vehicles, and the operator has to deliver the service
contracted for.
Contractors are responsible not just for delivering the vehicles but for
keeping them running for the 15 years of the contract. As Mr Roger Hall,
deputy director-general of Metrolink, says: 'If you can tie the builder in
to operating the system and have a share in running it, he cannot build you
a pig in a poke.' Each supertram costs Pounds 860,000, compared with Pounds
100,000 for a double-decker bus.
Metrolink's private-sector backers - GEC Alsthom, Mowlem and Amec - have
paid Pounds 5m for the operating concession and have formed a company with
25.1 per cent of the shares each and with Greater Manchester Buses and the
transport executive owning the remaining 24.7 per cent between them. The
structure keeps the public sector's interest below the 25 per cent limit
permitted by law for participation in private companies. GM Buses is jointly
owned by the 10 boroughs and cities making up the county of Greater
Manchester and is thus regarded as a public-sector company.
There has been criticism that Pounds 5m is too small a sum for the private
sector to pay for the Metrolink monopoly, but local politicians say the
public will benefit because the operator's right to exclusive profits has
been limited. That level is a commercial secret at present but is believed
to be low. Anything above it has to be shared with the public-transport
authorities.
Public-transport providers from cities throughout Britain, continental
Europe and the US are now studying the scheme. Sheffield will have a
supertram system next year, and Southampton and Croydon, south of London,
are among others planning schemes of their own.

FT  07 APR 92 / Coats Viyella cuts 566 jobs in N Ireland
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Belfast Correspondent and DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COATS Viyella announced 566 job losses at two of its Northern Ireland plants
yesterday.
The company is closing its loss-making Peter England Shirt factory at
Magherafelt, county Londonderry with the loss of 516 jobs. A further 50
people will be made redundant at the company's Maydown plant in Derry.
Coats Viyella, the province's second-largest manufacturing employer, blamed
the recession and an influx of cheap imports exacerbated by the weakness of
the dollar. It is the second Northern Ireland shirt-making plant closed by
Coats in the past year.
Some jobs may be saved. Northern Ireland business interests have signalled
that they might want to take over part of the Magherafelt operation. Coats
said yesterday, however, that the possibility was remote.
Intensive negotiations over the past four months involving Mr Richard
Needham, the province's economy minister, and senior Industrial Development
Board officials failed to secure a definite reprieve for the plant.
The Peter England label is a mid-priced product that has been affected by
imports. Coats supplies the same brand from outside the UK, largely in the
Far East. It will increase sourcing from there to make up any shortfall.
The company said it hoped to return its branded shirt business to 'an
acceptable level of profitability'. It still makes the more expensive Van
Heusen branded shirts in Northern Ireland.
Sir David Alliance, Coats' chairman, said the company remained committed to
its investments in Northern Ireland and would continue to employ more than
2,700 people in the province.
In the past year it had invested or committed itself to invest more than
Pounds 5m and it would continue to back profitable projects.

<TEXT>
A JOINT initiative to help sole traders with business debt and families with
multiple debt is to be launched today in Newcastle upon Tyne by the National
Association of Citizens Advice Bureaux and Newcastle City Council. The
scheme is the first such initiative between CAB and local authority
counsellors in the country.
Last year local authorities contributed Pounds 27m of the national
association's Pounds 38m annual budget.
Newcastle upon Tyne has seen personal debt increase sharply, with 103
personal bankruptcy cases being recorded in the city for the first two
months of this year - more than the total for the whole of 1980.
Newcastle City Council sees the initiative as a way of enhancing services at
a time when the council faces large budget cuts. The national association
believes the initiative may encourage local authorities to tackle rent and
poll tax arrears without resorting to sending in bailiffs.

FT  07 APR 92 / Central London bomb attack condemned
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY and JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CENTRAL London was again the target of a bomb yesterday, as it emerged that
an incoming government may be asked to move responsibility for
counter-terrorism from the police to MI5, the security service.
The device, left outside an apartment block in Bridle Lane, Soho, in the
West End, exploded at about 9.15am. There were no casualties.
Commander George Churchill-Coleman, head of Scotland Yard's anti-terrorist
squad, said the device contained less than 1lb of high explosive, and was
typical of those used by the IRA. He said the attack was an 'act of sheer
recklessness'. No one has claimed responsibility for the attack.
The blast occurred 150 metres from the London offices of Granada Television,
the independent broadcaster, which was due yesterday to screen interviews
with leaders of the main political parties.
Police said the distance of the bomb from Granada, and from a police
training academy in a neighbouring street, made it unlikely that either was
the target.
The Home Office yesterday refused to comment on a report that it was about
to submit a report on counter-terrorism to Downing Street.
However, sources close to the security services confirmed that the MI5
proposal had been under discussion, but faced resistance from some quarters,
particularly Scotland Yard's anti-terrorist branch.
It is understood that MI5, under Ms Stella Rimington, its newly appointed
director, is keen to reallocate the responsibilities of some employees no
longer engaged in counter-espionage. The option being considered is to
increase MI5's present involvement in intelligence-gathering on IRA
suspects. The police argue, though, that MI5 lacks the necessary expertise.

FT  07 APR 92 / Accountants greet EC report with muted approval
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
REPRESENTATIVES of the leading international accountancy firm networks
reacted yesterday with muted pleasure to the news that they appeared to have
been cleared by the European Commission of anti-competitive practices.
But questions remained over whether UK firms were charging excessive fees
compared with other parts of Europe, and whether additional regulation was
required to ensure auditor independence.
Mr Roy Chapman, national managing partner of Arthur Andersen in the UK,
said: 'This is rather a good thing. It does reassure us, but it really
confirmed what we already know. There is absolutely cut-throat competition.'
The reaction followed details of a report produced by National Economic
Research Associates (Nera), a London-based economic consultancy, on behalf
of DG IV, the EC competition directorate.
The study showed that the networks of the 'Big Six' firms - KPMG, Coopers &amp;
Lybrand, Ernst &amp; Young, Arthur Andersen, Price Waterhouse and Deloitte Ross
Tohmatsu - dominate the audit work of large European companies. The firms
rely on the same companies for much of their non-audit income.
In spite of a statement from DG IV that accountancy was not a high priority,
figures in the report show the firms in each EC member state as highly
'insulated', with little evidence of harmonisation in the spirit of the
single market.
That might lead to calls for further action to break down barriers to trade
in accountancy services.
The UK partner rates were the highest in any EC country at 1.4 times the
European average, and almost twice the rate in Portugal.

THE TYPICAL director of a quoted British company is a 52-year-old male
chartered accountant, a study of UK management has shown.
He will probably have gone to a grammar school and is also likely to be a

Royal Automobile Club or the Middlesex Cricket Club.
The analysis of British directors shows an apparently unchanged group in
spite of the social forces of the past decade. It is contained in the Arthur
Andersen Corporate Register, a twice-yearly directory of UK management.
From a database of 20,000 directors and corporate officers at 1,612 fully
listed and unlisted securities market companies, only 426 women hold senior
management positions. Their average age is 47.
Of the directors who admitted to a professional qualification, chartered
accountancy was most frequent, followed by chartered surveying. Eton was the
most commonly mentioned public school and Cambridge the most popular
university.
The typical board has seven or eight directors, including three
non-executive directors.

FT  07 APR 92 / Consumer credit up Pounds 13m in month
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CONSUMER credit demand showed the first signs of recovery in February after
six consecutive months of decline.
The Central Statistical Office reported that net credit advanced to
consumers by finance houses, building societies and through bank credit
cards that are part of the Visa or Mastercard systems increased by Pounds
13m in the month, lifting the amount of such credit outstanding to Pounds
30.14bn.
The slight increase in the amount of credit outstanding contrasted with City
expectations of net repayments totalling Pounds 50m in February. Net
repayments had reduced the amount of credit outstanding by Pounds 62m in
January.
Over the six months to January, net repayments cut the total of consumer
debt by Pounds 492m.
New credit advanced to consumers was a seasonally adjusted Pounds 3.97bn in
February, compared with Pounds 3.9bn in January and Pounds 3.57bn in
February last year, the CSO said.
In the three months from December to February, the amount of new credit
advanced to consumers totalled Pounds 11.94bn, compared with Pounds 11.68bn
in the previous three months.
City analysts were reluctant to read too much into the February figures,
although the rise in credit outstanding added to evidence that consumer
confidence and spending are recovering.
Mr Kevin Gardiner, UK economist at Warburg Securities, pointed out that
mortgage loans were a far more important indicator of the willingness of
consumers to go into debt and that there was no sign yet of a recovery in
the housing market.

FT  07 APR 92 / Link with private sector welcomed
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Jeremy Beecham, chairman of the Labour-controlled Association of
Metropolitan Authorities, yesterday told members of the Tyne and Wear
Chamber of Commerce that local authorities had come to see over the past
decade that partnership with the private sector was fundamental to the
wellbeing of their areas. He said that to fulfil their responsibilities to
their areas, councils could not be indifferent to the needs of business, and
business could not thrive against a background of decline and decay.

FT  07 APR 92 / Blacks in Liverpool may become 'underclass'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ETHNIC groups in Liverpool are not even on the verge of equal opportunity,
according to a Liverpool University study of young black people in the city,
Alan Pike writes.
Future generations of black people are, the report says, balanced between
remaining in touch with mainstream society or becoming 'a class decisively
apart and eventually an underclass'.
The study, by Professor Kenneth Roberts, professor of sociology at
Liverpool, and other members of the university's sociology and social policy
department, contests the idea that 'Britain's racial divisions will slacken
away, given time, as immigrant minorities become culturally assimilated and
the white majority grow accustomed to citizens with different skin colours'.
A study of youngsters aged 16 to 19, the report says, made 'crystal clear'
that young black people were not obtaining equal labour market rewards even
with the same qualifications as whites.

FT  07 APR 92 / Military pilot training to be contracted out
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE MINISTRY OF Defence is preparing to privatise part of its pilot-training
programme in a deal worth about Pounds 30m to the winner of the contract,
Daniel Green writes.
The four bidders include British Aerospace, which has a training college at
Prestwick, Scotland, and Oxford Air Training School, Britain's largest
professional air training organisation.
Bidding closed at the end of February and the MoD says it will make its
recommendation to the government in the autumn. It wants to name the winner
in January next year, with the 10-year contract starting the following July.
The RAF trains 72 pilots every year at the elementary level and the Royal
Navy trains a further 105.
The MoD specified that the winner of the contract should own and operate the
20 training aircraft needed. The winner will have to operate from Topcliffe
Royal Air Force station at Thirsk, North Yorkshire, where it will supply
elementary training.
The Oxford Air Training School is offering British-built Slingsby aircraft
or Zlins, which are made in Czechoslovakia. BAe would use the Swiss-built
FFA Bravo.

FT  07 APR 92 / Confidence stable, survey shows
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CONSUMER confidence stabilised in the first quarter of this year, suggesting
that consumer spending will have risen slightly between January and March
for the third successive quarter, according to a survey published yesterday.
The latest quarterly regional consumer survey, produced by Gallup and
Business Strategies, an economic consultancy, found a leveling out of
regional differences in consumer sentiment compared with a year ago.
Consumer optimism in greater London and the west Midlands, which was well
below the national average a year ago, had recovered to approximately the
average level.
East Anglia and the south-east outside greater London emerged from the
latest survey with the strongest consumer sentiment. Wales was significantly
less optimistic than the rest of the UK in both the first quarter of this
year and the same period of last year.
Business Strategies said that consumers in the south were more optimistic
about the overall economic situation than those elsewhere in the country.
Nevertheless, they were reluctant to take on big purchases, possibly because
of an overall decline in household finances in the region after a sharp rise
in unemployment last year.
Mr Charles Burton, a director of Business Strategies, said the survey
suggested that consumer spending in Britain rose by 0.3 per cent in the
first quarter compared with the last quarter of last year.
Consumer spending last year fell by an estimated 1.7 per cent - the biggest
fall since records started in 1948.

FT  07 APR 92 / Hertfordshire head teachers oppose schools' opting out
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HEAD TEACHERS of local-authority secondary schools in Hertfordshire have
declared strong opposition to their schools' opting out of local-authority
control and have condemned plans to reintroduce selection of pupils.
Encouragement for all schools to opt out and a move towards selection lie at
the heart of the Conservative manifesto, and the declaration - at a private
conference of the county's head teachers held late last week - will
embarrass ministers.
Throughout the election campaign Mr Kenneth Clarke, education secretary, has
predicted an avalanche of applications to opt out if the Conservatives are
returned. He has publicly speculated that most secondary schools will opt
out within two years, and is proposing to allow opted-out schools to
reintroduce selection if they wish.
However, Hertfordshire's head teachers resolved that they would 'advise
school governing bodies and parents who raise the issue' that 'it is in the
best interests of the education service in Hertfordshire for schools to
continue to be maintained by the county council'.
They also formally affirmed a 'commitment to maintaining a system of
comprehensive education . . . which affords equality of opportunity.'
Only five of Hertfordshire's 79 comprehensive secondary schools are
grant-maintained. None of the other 74 is engaged in a ballot to opt out.
Mr Jack Straw, the shadow education secretary, said the resolution showed
'that head teachers can see through the bribes to opt out to the real damage
it does to the local education service'.
Mr Matthew Taylor, for the Liberal Democrats, said it 'showed that most
heads value the support of a good local authority'.
However, Mr Tim Eggar, schools minister, said: 'We would like schools to opt
out, but we have no intention of forcing them to. It's for parents and
governors to decide, and we will abide by that.'
A majority vote by parents in a secret ballot is required before a school
can opt out. With most existing grant-maintained schools, the move was
instigated - or at least supported - by the school's head teacher.
Of the 5,000 state secondary schools in England and Wales, only 200 (4 per
cent) are grant-maintained and 159 are grammar schools. Labour and the
Liberal Democrats are committed to abolishing both types of school.
Mr Straw challenged Mr Clarke yesterday to publish evidence about last
year's tests for seven-year-olds which reportedly contradicts ministerial
claims that the social and ethnic background of pupils and schools could not
be held to account for differences in performance.

FT  07 APR 92 / Business survey signals upturn
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BUSINESS confidence has recovered to its highest level for more than two
years, according to the latest quarterly survey of business expectations
from Dun &amp; Bradstreet, the business information group.
The survey of more than 1,900 managing directors in all regions and sectors
of business, services and trade found that companies were notably more
optimistic about orders and sales than at the beginning of the year.
Confidence in London and the south-east, the regions that led the UK into
recession, improved markedly.
However, the overall recovery in confidence is unlikely to result in reduced
unemployment. Dun &amp; Bradstreet said pressure on staffing levels was lighter
than in its previous survey but it forecast continued cuts in employment.
One in three companies expects to make people redundant while only one in
five expects to employ more staff.
The survey was carried out between March 11 and March 27, covering the
period immediately after the March 10 Budget, which has been dominated by
the general election campaign and the publication of differing remedies for
Britain's economic ills by all the main parties. It found that the chief
executives of 52 per cent of companies expected their order books to
increase in the present quarter, compared with 23 per cent predicting a
fall.
The balance of replies - plus 29 per cent - compares with plus 7 per cent at
the beginning of this year and is close to the plus 30 per cent balance
recorded in the fourth quarter of 1989, before the recession.
Fifty two per cent of companies expect sales to increase. The balance of
companies expecting higher sales increased to 25 per cent from 7 per in the
last quarterly survey and is back to levels last seen in the first quarter
of 1990.
Dun &amp; Bradstreet found that more companies expected to increase stocks,
suggesting greater optimism about future demand. The number of companies
expecting to increase exports, at 32 per cent, outnumbers the 11 per cent
expecting exports to fall by nearly three to one.
Mr Philip Mellor, Dun &amp; Bradstreet's marketing manager, said the survey
showed 'a proper renewal of business confidence'.
He said another Dun &amp; Bradstreet survey showing a strong rise in business
optimism in the US underpinned the improved expectations.
The report is the latest of several tentative indicators pointing to better
times.

FT  07 APR 92 / Decline in new car sales goes on with 15% fall in March
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UK NEW car sales plunged by 15.2 per cent in March, dispelling motor
industry hopes that last month's favourable Budget would bring an end to the
2 1/2 -year recession.
New car sales have been in decline for 29 consecutive months as carmakers
have suffered the steepest decline into recession since 1945.
According to figures released by the Society of Motor Manufacturers and
Traders, new car sales fell to 143,115 in March from 168,854 in the same
month a year ago.
New car registrations in March were 35.3 per cent lower than in the same
month three years ago.
In the first three months of this year new car sales totalled 406,211, a
fall of 11.1 per cent from the same period a year ago and 35.6 per cent
lower than in the corresponding period of 1989.
Carmakers remain uncertain about the underlying trend.
Within the overall depressed market Rover, a subsidiary of British
Aerospace, has emerged as one of the main losers.
Last month alone its sales plunged by 45.2 per cent from the same month a
year ago, resulting in a precipitous drop in its market share to only 10.0
per cent from 15.5 per cent a year ago.
For the first three months Rover has slipped into fourth place in the UK new
car sales league after being overtaken by the Peugeot group of France, which
includes Citroen. Rover's new car sales in the first three months were 32.1
per cent lower than in the same period a year ago. Its market share has
fallen to 12.0 per cent from 15.7 per cent a year ago.
The Peugeot group and Renault, the two French car makers, as well as BMW of
Germany have gained significant ground in the first three months.
The Peugeot group boosted the combined share of its Peugeot and Citroen
marques to 12.2 per cent from 10.2 per cent a year ago, helped by a 6.1 per
cent increase in sales volume.
The pattern of UK new car sales was also distorted last month by Ford, the
UK market leader, which launched a fresh price war in the wake of the Budget
and also pushed through an abnormally high level of registrations in the
final days of the month with the climax of a special sales incentive scheme.
Ford registered 41.6 per cent of last month's sales in the last five days of
the month. For the whole of the month it gained a share of 24.9 per cent,
but in the last five days its daily share rose rapidly from 24.1 per cent to
30.3 per cent, 35.8 per cent, 44.0 per cent and 43.3 per cent.
However, in spite of its costly marketing incentives, Ford still fell far
short of its 30 per cent market share target for March. The company is under
severe pressure after running up record financial losses last year.

FT  07 APR 92 / Election 1992: Slow progress on mean streets - The Issues:
Urban Regeneration
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ON THE night of her 1987 election victory, Mrs Thatcher stood on the
staircase of Conservative Central Office proclaiming her mission for a third
term: to work harder for the inner cities.
There was a clear political motive for such apparent philanthropy: little by
little, the Tories were being squeezed out of Britain's cities. Glasgow,
Liverpool, Manchester, Newcastle and Hull were Tory-free zones; Edinburgh,
Cardiff, Birmingham and Sheffield looked vulnerable to the same fate.
The loss of political support was more galling because the Conservatives
could claim significant successes in inner-city regeneration. In Liverpool,
for example, the refurbishment of the Albert Dock had created a magnet for
4m tourists a year. The garden festival cleared a 125-acre site and restored
an element of civic pride. And the Wavertree Technology Park provided
Liverpool with its first A1 office park, attracting top
information-technology companies to Merseyside.
Much of the burden of regeneration had been borne by the urban development
corporations (UDCs), quangos created by Mr Michael Heseltine during his
first spell as environment secretary.
Local councils appeared to have failed in their urban programmes, spending
increasing amounts on costly public-sector projects without halting the
decline. The UDCs were expected to use government money to lever in private
capital, attracting developers by reclaiming land and putting infrastructure
into place.
However, in their haste to make progress, they all too often failed to win
local support. Mr Harry Rimmer, the leader of Liverpool City Council, says:
'They planted a lot of trees and carried through prestige projects like the
Albert Dock. But there were no jobs or training for the riverside
communities and that made people cynical.'
To fulfil Mrs Thatcher's 1987 pledge, the government launched its Action for
Cities initiative, a re-packaging and streamlining of urban aid programmes.
With costly breakfast briefings and proliferation of action documents, it
did little to win over the local communities.
But Mrs Thatcher's departure in 1990 brought Mr Heseltine back to the
environment department with new ideas for involving local authorities in
urban regeneration. He launched City Challenge, an invitation to 15 city
councils to bid for Pounds 412m of funds, with the money going to the 10
councils producing the most convincing bids. Councils were told that the key
to success would be to demonstrate effective partnerships between public,
private and voluntary sectors.
City Challenge was immediately derided as a 'game show' by Mr Bryan Gould,
Labour's environment spokesman, and a 'lottery' by Mr Jeremy Beecham,
chairman of the Labour-controlled Association of Metropolitan Authorities.
But whatever the ideological objections to competing for funds, Labour
councils entered the bidding process with gusto.
Liverpool won Pounds 48m for a five-year programme of city-centre renovation
backed by local businesses, community representatives and voluntary
organisations such as the Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra which stands to
benefit from the restoration of its concert hall.
With Pounds 750m on offer in a second round of City Challenge, Liverpool is
bidding for further funds for a large development at Speke and Garston.
If the Conservatives form the next government, the City Challenge approach
will allocate a growing proportion of government funds for regeneration.
Money will be concentrated on a few large projects where substantial amounts
of private capital can be attracted and the partnership approach can make a
significant impact.
A Labour government would honour existing City Challenge commitments, but
the competitive approach would be scrapped. Partnerships between the public,
private and voluntary sectors would still be encouraged, but funds would be
distributed 'on the basis of need'.
The UDCs and other government development bodies would be incorporated into
locally accountable regional development agencies. This would not be
unwelcome to many involved in the UDCs who are already forging informal
links with other development agencies in their areas.
Whatever the complexion of the next government, the economic downturn poses
a challenge to the partnership approach now favoured by all the parties. The
recession and the depressed commercial property market have reduced the flow
of private capital into urban redevelopment.
In Liverpool, for example, the next stage of the development corporation's
programme, the clearing of the north docks, needs substantial investment
which the private sector is unlikely to provide.
The Conservatives' political chances in the inner cities may benefit from
the partnership approach which Mr Heseltine has done so much to foster. That
is now the commonly accepted wisdom on both sides of the political spectrum,
locally and nationally.
However, the party's failure to involve the local communities with their
programmes has alienated many of those who were supposed to benefit. And the
reliance on the private sector to provide the leadership and capital for
redevelopment has left their market-based approach temporarily stalled as
the recession has taken its toll.

<TEXT>
AS the prospect of a hung parliament looms, the spotlight has rested on the
role that might be played by the Liberal Democrats. But depending on the
precise arithmetic of the election result, one or all of the minority
parties could well find itself holding the balance of power.
The support of those 26 to 29 MPs who are not from the three main parties -
or at least their abstentions in Commons votes - could make it unnecessary
for Labour or Tories to woo the Liberal Democrats.
The biggest group is the Northern Ireland MPs. The three or four MPs
expected from the nationalist Social Democratic and Labour party would
support Labour and probably favour proportional representation.
The 13 or so Unionist MPs would not necessarily rule out working with Labour
if it changed its stance on Northern Ireland. But the Ulster Unionist party,
which had nine MPs in the last parliament, is usually more in line with
Conservative thinking and opposed to electoral reform.
The smaller Democratic Unionist party (three MPs previously) might not
object to PR but is unlikely to act independently of the Unionist party.
The Scottish National party, on the basis of recent polls, would would have
about eight seats. It refuses to discuss what it might do in a hung
parliament, saying: 'We are fighting this election to win independence for
Scotland.'
But while the SNP has a long-standing policy of refusing any deals with the
Conservative party at any level, it does not have a similar prohibition with
regard to Labour.
The party has a deep distrust of Labour, and of Mr Kinnock in particular.
But it might find it difficult to vote against a Queen's Speech that
included proposals for a strong Scottish parliament, especially if the
alternative was the fall of a Labour government.
Plaid Cymru, the Welsh nationalist party which looks like winning three
seats, has said it will enter no deals without a promise that a Welsh
parliament will be established within a year. But Labour may be able to win
its support with its commitment to an assembly in its first parliament.
The 10 Liberal Democrats (out of 22 in the last parliament) defending
Scottish constituencies would fit more easily with a Labour government
promising devolution.

influence policy in a hung parliaments. Under several scenarios, one of

FT  07 APR 92 / Election 1992: PR taxes attention in electoral reform debate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN, Public Policy Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TWO results of the election can be forecast with confidence: the Liberal
Democrats will get about 20 per cent or more of the popular vote and Liberal
Democrat MPs are unlikely to occupy many more than 5 per cent of seats in
the House of Commons.
In most elections, the Liberal Democrats and their predecessors have been
able to do little about such under-representation except to cry 'unfair'.
But this time there appears to be a strong chance of a hung parliament in
which neither the Conservatives nor Labour would be able to form a majority.
If that is so, Mr Paddy Ashdown says the Liberal Democrats are likely to
make reform of the UK's first-past-the-post election system - which produces
this disproportionate result - a condition of support for a minority
government. He points to the fact that the UK is now one of the few European
countries which does not use proportional representation (PR) to elect its
parliament.
If Labour is the largest party, Mr Kinnock will use the Plant commission,
Labour's inquiry on electoral reform, to woo the Liberal Democrats. Chaired
by Professor Raymond Plant of Southampton University, this has spent 18
months examining the pros and cons of different electoral systems. Mr
Kinnock has promised to give the commission official status and to broaden
its composition to include representatives of other parties.
The new Scottish parliament is to be elected by PR and the Plant commission
has proposed the additional member system used in Germany. It is thought
likely to recommend PR for elections to the European parliament, where the
UK's adherence to first-past-the-post has distorted the overall party
balance at Strasbourg.
Even if Labour agreed to a switch to PR for the Commons, there could still
be disagreement over the timetable for introducing the change: Mr Ashdown
has said that he wants this to be the last general election under
first-past-the-post; Mr Kinnock wants to submit the change to the electorate
at the next election.
And there could also be disagreement over the system to adopt. The Liberal
Democrats favour the single transferable vote, under which most voters would
cast their votes in multi-member constituencies. This allows them to choose
between the candidates put up by the parties and even to elect MPs from more
than one party.
Labour is likely to prefer one of the two systems which retains a strong
one-to-one constituency link in line with British traditions. That means the
additional member system or the alternative vote - which the 1929 Labour
government planned to introduce before losing power.
If the largest party is the Conservatives, Mr Ashdown is unlikely to receive
a positive response to his demands for PR. Mr John Major is implacably
opposed to electoral reform: yesterday he underlined his determination that
the Tories will 'in no circumstances' enter into negotiations with the
Liberal Democrats on PR.
He opposes PR because he believes it would detract from strong government:
if the UK had used PR it is likely that every election for the last 30 years
would have produced a coalition government. His belief is that such
governments find it hard to agree difficult decisions so that, for example,
it would have been harder to mount the Falklands campaign or to send the
British contingent to the Gulf war.
Underlining his opposition to PR the prime minister also said yesterday that
he 'would not fancy' changing the system for local elections or for choosing
Euro MPs.
Mr Major quotes unnamed leaders of other European countries that have PR who
would like to get rid of it. The only country which has tried to move from
PR to first-past-the-post is Ireland - on both occasions the move was
defeated in a referendum. Certainly there are politicians in Italy -
particularly Christian Democrats - who blame their system of PR for the
paralysis and corruption which dogs Italian politics. In Israel, there is
growing discontent with their list system which allows religious and
extremist parties with only 1 per cent or 2 per cent of the vote to dictate
policies in return for sustaining a coalition.
However, according to Simon Osborn of the Electoral Reform Society, all the
new democracies of eastern Europe have chosen some form of PR for their
parliamentary elections. 'They all visited London, and were very impressed
with our parliamentary system but they all rejected our electoral system,
having lived under the dictatorship of minority governments for decades.'
Whether the UK will continue to allow a party with as little as 42 per cent
of the vote to govern with a 100-seat majority remains to be seen. But the
arguments over electoral systems will undoubtedly continue.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
ELECTORIAL SYSTEM - THE OPTIONS
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
FIRST-PAST-THE-POST: the candidate with the highest number of votes in a
      constituency is elected.
LIST SYSTEM: Voters vote for party lists of candidates in mulit-member
      constituencies. Seats are divided between the parites in
      proportion to the votes gained in the constituency and allocated
      to candidates from the top of the list.
ADDIDIONAL NUMBER SYSTEM: At least half the seats are elected on a
      first-past-the-post basis. The rest are allocated to parties on
      some sort of list basis, so that the number of MPs reflects the
      distribution of the popular vote.
SINGLE TRANSFERABLE VOTE: Voters number candidates in order of
      preference in multi-member constituencies. Complex formula elects
      candidates with more than a set quota of votes. Second and
      subsequent preferences are redistributed until enough candidates
      reach the quota.
ALTERNATIVE VOTE: Voters number candidates in order of preference. If no
      candidate wins more than 50 per cent of the votes, the second
      choices of the candidate with the fewest votes are reallocated
      until someone wins a majority of the votes.

MR PADDY Ashdown yesterday left an escape clause in the conditions he has
set for Liberal Democrat support in a hung parliament, which could allow a
deal without agreement on proportional representation.
In comments which only increase the likelihood of a pact between the Liberal
Democrats and Labour, Mr Ashdown hinted that he might help to keep a
minority government in office if the uncertainty created by a hung
parliament threatened an economic crisis.
Previously Mr Ashdown had said he could never guarantee absolutely how he
would react if he held the balance of power, although he set a commitment to
proportional representation in the first Queen's Speech of the new
government as the pre-requisite for his party's support.
The timing of his comments - which included a warning of the economic chaos
a minority Labour government might cause - fuelled speculation that he might
be prepared to make compromises.
Liberal Democrat MPs will meet in London on Saturday to finalise a
negotiating stance for any coalition deals. Arrangements are also in hand
for a special conference to consult other party members if necessary.
Mr Ashdown also dismissed reports that he was calling for four cabinet posts
for Liberal Democrats in a coalition government, as 'premature and
speculative'.
Last night at a rally at Richmond upon Thames he sought to refocus attention
on his party's pledge to raise income tax for education spending and stepped
up his efforts to persuade Labour or the Tories to enter a coalition
government. 'Just imagine a government which worked for partnership and
consent,' he said.
Earlier, on the BBC's Election Call programme, Mr Ashdown was asked if he
would, in all circumstances, vote against a Queen's Speech that had no
reference to proportional representation.
He replied that Liberal Democrats were 'prepared' to vote down such a
government, but added: 'Of course I can't give you an 'in all circumstances'
undertaking. You are asking me to predict how I'd play as the batsman in the
third ball of the fourth over after next.'
He said that 'in any foreseeable circumstances' a minority government which
put its own interests before the country's should be brought down. However,
he added: 'Sensible people don't close every option.'
If, for instance, Britain faced a crisis over Libya, or the pound was
'dropping like a stone', then 'obviously, everyone has to do what they think
is right and, under the circumstances, for the country's good'.
Party officials insisted that Mr Ashdown was not changing his position but
conceded he had left some leeway for negotiations.
Mr Ashdown said that under a minority Labour government 'the pound will come
under very severe pressure, they (the government) will be almost immediately
faced with the possibility, the prospect, of having to raise interest
rates'.
At his morning press conference he had promised that his party would, 'work
constructively for a partnership government which lasts the lifetime of a
parliament'.

FT  07 APR 92 / Election 1992: Tories revive tax message
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
FUTURE TAX cuts would be directed primarily at middle-income and
lower-income earners, Mr John Major signalled yesterday, as he said he did
not expect to change the 40 per cent top rate of income tax.
The prime minister also reinforced the message that the widening of the
Pounds 2,000 20 per cent tax band was the most likely way for a future Tory
government to seek to reach its target of a standard tax rate of 20 per
cent.
Though stressing that this route to tax cuts was intended to help those on
the lowest incomes, the prime minister conceded that those on low pay would
lose some of the advantage from lower taxes in reduced income-related
benefits, such as family credit.
Speaking at a press conference in Southampton, Mr Major said: 'I don't
anticipate at the moment changing the 40p tax rate. The tax priorities I
have are for the basic rate of 25p to come down to 20p.
'I believe that after the structural changes we have seen in tax, that is
the right way to proceed in the years ahead. You don't always have Pounds
2.3bn, but there is usually a smaller sum that can now be used in tax cuts
by widening that 20p band.'
He acknowledged the high marginal deduction rates faced by those on
income-related benefits, saying that the problem of withdrawing benefit as
income increased was 'statistically unavoidable'. He added: 'I looked at it
very carefully when I was a social security minister. What you can do is
alleviate the problem, as we have done in changes to the social security
system.'
His comments came as the Tories again hammered home their message that
Labour would stop the recovery. Mr David Mellor, Treasury chief secretary,
warned that a Labour victory on Thursday would necessitate an immediate rise
in interest rates of 2 or 2.5 percentage points to prevent sterling being
devalued.
Mr Mellor argued that Labour's policies would cause an immediate reduction
in consumer demand and add about Pounds 10bn to costs for industry.
While the Tories are emphasising the extent to which the proceeds of growth
can be directed towards spending on public services, they are also keen to
maintain the sharp difference between themselves and Labour over tax.
Mr Mellor estimated that Labour's shadow Budget would raise taxation by
Pounds 1.89bn in the first year. The initial impact, he said, would be all
the more damaging because increases in tax and National Insurance
contributions were likely to apply from July 1 whereas increased pensions
and child benefit were unlikely to be introduced before October.
Earlier, Mr Major had shrugged off a cut on the face caused by an egg thrown
while he was on a walkabout on the outskirts of Southampton.
Though slightly shaken by the incident, he pointed to the generally warm and
enthusiastic response of the crowd. 'I do not think it's right for
politicians to operate a sanitised campaign, cut off from the people they're
asking to represent,' he said. He insisted his campaign was 'gaining
momentum'.

THE Scottish National party is set to capture three seats from the
Conservatives, including the prize scalp of Mr Ian Lang, the Scottish
secretary, according to the Press Association's poll of 10,000 potential
voters, results of which were announced last night.
A uniform 10.5 per cent swing to Labour in the West Midlands, as the poll
suggests, would leave Birmingham with only one Tory MP - Dame Jill Knight in
Edgbaston - with Labour taking Hall Green, Northfield and Selly Oak.
It would also enable Labour to gain Wolverhampton South-West, held by the
Conservatives for more than 40 years and which Mr Enoch Powell represented
from 1950 to February 1974.
Mr Francis Maude, financial secretary to the Treasury, would be a
ministerial casualty in Warwickshire North.
Two other ministers, Mr John Maples, economic secretary to the Treasury, and
Mr Colin Moynihan, junior energy minister, face defeat in Lewisham West and
Lewisham East if a uniform swing to Labour in London of 7 per cent, as
suggested in the poll, happens. The Conservatives would also lose Hampstead
and Highgate to Labour's Ms Glenda Jackson, and Hayes and Harlington which,
until the emergence of the Social Democratic party in 1981, Labour had held
continuously from 1945. A uniform swing of 9 per cent in the south-east
would see the Tories lose the two Southampton seats, one of which is held by
Mr Christopher Chope, the roads minister.
ICM polled 10,460 adults in 330 constituencies between March 31 and April 3.
Figures show the change against 1987 election results, excluding
by-elections. The percentage share of the vote in the regional breakdown may
not add up to 100 because of rounding.

FT  07 APR 92 / Election 1992: Fear tarnishes gilded southern realm - David
Marsh on the Tory marginals where 'For Sale' signs outnumber party posters
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN THE gilded southern realm of Toryland, the daffodils fluttering on town
perimeters have been among the few bright spots in a campaign studded with
negatives.
This has not been a time for hope, vision or even the firm announcement of
convictions. 'For Sale' signs outside houses heavily outnumber party
election posters. Across southern England, from Bath to Basildon, voting
will be shaped less by ideology than by two sets of opposing fears.
The recession, impinging particularly on service industries and
higher-income mortgagors, has chilled middle-class hearts previously
uplifted by wealth-creating Thatcherism. Both Labour and the Liberal
Democrats are banking on a widespread protest vote by disaffected
Conservatives to make inroads in the Tories' southern territories.
For many in the south, however, the present fright over unemployment and
bankruptcies is outweighed by a greater fear: that a Labour government could
make matters still worse.
By increasing taxes on the better-off and introducing new regulations on
business, Labour - so Tories argue - could end up twisting further the
stiletto inserted into the southern economy.
Conservative campaigners, heavily pushing the 'Fear Kinnock' message, this
week are likely to win back thousands of wavering Tories. Nonetheless,
disillusionment with the government can be expected to swing several
marginal seats to the opposition.
Labour appears to have a good chance of clinching at least one of the two
key Southampton constituencies. The party is offering a fresh start, but no
magic solutions. Mr Alan Whitehead, the respected leader of Southampton City
Council, standing for Labour in the Test constituency, is confident of
toppling the Tories' 12 per cent majority. If Labour forms the next
government, he says, 'We don't kid ourselves we'll be able to solve all the
problems or see the British economy basking in sunshine.'
The Liberal Democrats, for their part, have concentrated on three seats
where the Tories are defending small majorities: Portsmouth South, Bath and
Cheltenham.
In places such as these, 1980s' prosperity has raised aspirations without
being able to fulfil them all. It has also dramatically increased the
vulnerability of many to the harsher economic climate. Mr Richard Askew,
rector of Bath Abbey, says that, after unemployment, 'the most saddening
aspect' of the recession is the rise in house repossessions.
Mr Peter Beebe, head of the Southampton chamber of commerce, speaks of the
'sledge-hammer' effect of the downturn in the city. Council officials in
Portsmouth say their city is suffering a 'double recession', with cuts in
defence spending adding to the impact of the recession.
Many larger and smaller businesses, clearly, are resolved to ride out the
storm. Mrs Janet Hart, who runs the Cornwallis Business Centre in Basildon,
says that of the 40 small companies in her building, half are doing well.
The other half face difficulties 'but are determined to be there when the
upturn comes'. A firm Tory supporter, she says: 'Things will bounce back.'
Beyond the economic problems, evidence of social dislocation abounds -
jarring with Conservative claims to represent the party of order and virtue.
In most southern counties last year the increase in notifiable crime was
well above the national rise of 16 per cent. Crime went up by 34 per cent in
Kent, 21 per cent in Avon and Somerset, 20 per cent in Hampshire and 18 per
cent in Sussex and Surrey.
In the staid Tory seat of Hove on the south coast, licentiousness is on
display just round the corner from the constituency office of Mr Tim
Sainsbury, Hove's MP since 1973. In the town last week I handed Mr Sainsbury
a set of 15 different brightly coloured advertising cards for call girls, on
show in a nearby telephone kiosk. Somewhat wanly Mr Sainsbury - who holds an
impregnable 37 per cent majority - said he would be asking British Telecom
to investigate.
Against this background, it is not surprising that Tory candidates resort to
negative arguments. Mr Simon Coombs, the sharp-tongued Conservative MP for
Swindon since 1983, defending a 7.2 per cent majority and a mortgage of well
over Pounds 100,000 on a home in Kennington in south London, declares: 'We
offer them (the electorate) negative security. Things would be far worse
under Labour. Higher taxes, higher inflation, higher interest rates, higher
mortgages, less defence and more government interference.'
Mr Nigel Forman, the Conservative incumbent in the safe seat of Carshalton
and Wallington, tries to push a positive message when he goes canvassing.
But he admits that April 9 will basically be a competition of negatives:
'People give us points for being less incompetent (than Labour).'
The prize for negative campaigning goes to Mr David Amess, who has held
Basildon for the Conservatives since 1983. He shows exceptional
vituperativeness towards his Labour opponent, Mr John Potter. Among his more
printable assertions, Mr Amess, a staunch Catholic, criticises Mr Potter's
agnosticism.
Even in safe seats, however, Conservatives are ladling out the vitriol. Mr
Peter Griffiths, who has sat for Portsmouth North since 1979, commanding a
31 per cent majority in 1987, says Neil Kinnock would be the worst prime
minister since the 18th century.
The Tories believe that if Mr Kinnock moves into Downing Street it will be
the result of well-packaged knavery. Mr James Hill, the veteran MP for
Southampton Test, accuses his opponents of being 'tricky little devils'.
More thoughtfully, other Conservatives discern deeper factors at work. If
the Tories lose, part of the blame will be heaped on the policy of keeping
interest rates high during the longest recession since 1930-32. This is a
consequence of Britain's decision to join the European exchange rate
mechanism in October 1990.
Mr Christopher Chope, a fervent Thatcherite who has been MP for Southampton
Itchen since 1983, says: 'After the election, all political parties will be
doing some hard thinking about the desirability or otherwise of having
economic policies influenced by what is going on in Germany.'
In Carshalton, Mr Forman has a particular insight into the consequences of
ERM membership. Between 1987 and 1989 he was parliamentary private secretary
to the then chancellor of the exchequer, Mr Nigel Lawson - a firm supporter
of joining the ERM.
'Whatever the result, this election is likely to be seen as the first
British national election in which external factors such as the influence of
the Bundesbank have been decisive,' says Mr Forman - heralding what could
become, once the dust settles, a central component of the Tory post-mortem.

FT  07 APR 92 / Election 1992: Family at war with dissent - Paul Cheeseright
returns to the Martins, the FT's family of floating voters
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ASHDOWN one, Major two, Kinnock three. That was the pecking order of the
leading politicians in the esteem of the Martin family after they watched a
television election special featuring the three men last night.
The studio audience heckled Mr Kinnock for refusing to reveal his personal
view on proportional representation, and hissed Mr Major for refusing to
apologise for the poll tax.
This family is hung, just as the next parliament is likely to be. The men,
Tony and Russell, had a majority in favour of Ashdown after ITV's World In
Action special. Lyn was more ambivalent.
'He got straight to the point,' said Russell. But Lyn said: 'Where's his
team? There's more to it than just the one. I quite like him but I don't
think he's strong enough.' Tony advocated what the polls suggest is unlikely
to happen. 'I'd like to see him side-by-side with John Major.' Russell
agreed.
Mr Kinnock struck the Martins as rather evasive. It was the PR issue that
did it. 'He blew it on that last question. His true colours came out. He
didn't really answer it. He didn't get to the centre of it.' The difficulty
for Mr Kinnock is that Tony and Lyn remember the problems of the 1970s. They
will have to decide whether the Labour of the 1990s is the same party.
The tendency after last night's broadcast is to hope for some sort of
situation which engenders co-operation and minimises bickering. How the
family will work out which vote will help towards that utopia is still
unclear.

FT  07 APR 92 / Election 1992: Property debts - Ballot Box
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
One of the first questions that seems invariably to greet an incoming
Labour-led administration is what to do about the property market. The
problem lies with the banking system: overheating under the Tories leads to
a hangover in banking under Labour. If the resulting hole in bank balance
sheets is big enough, the Bank of England starts to ponder the wisdom of a
demarche to Number 11 Downing Street.
Not long after Labour came to power in 1974, the then governor Gordon
Richardson found himself asking for support from Denis Healey, against a
background of considerable political antipathy for fringe bankers and
property. Despite enjoying support from the influential Harold Lever, his
request was rebuffed.
Now the property men are once again popping up on cue. First, Canadian-based
developers Olympia &amp; York admitted to difficulties. Then came Gerald
Ronson's Heron Corporation, followed by Trevor Osborne's Speyhawk. All are
talking about plans for restructuring their debts.
The difference this time is that there is not much of a fringe banking
sector standing between the clearers and the property men. The foreign banks
are also taking a larger share of the losses. Another difference is that
National Westminster, which in 1974 was forced to make an unprecedented
announcement to the effect that it was not going bust, appears to be less
exposed than Barclays is today.
No doubt the clearing banks are too big to fail. A shore-up for property
anyway looks a poor bet under Labour. And since Olympia &amp; York's Canary
Wharf development is widely regarded as a Tory flagship, that is one place
where Labour sympathy is most unlikely to be forthcoming.

FT  07 APR 92 / Election 1992: Second opinion - Ballot Box
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Ballot Box reported last Saturday that a poll in Pulse showed that the
Tories were still the favourite party of family doctors. It has been pointed
out to us, however, that Pulse is by no means the only GPs' magazine. One
correspondent says that it is simply the one preferred by rightwing doctors.
Doctors on the left tend to go for General Practitioner, which has slightly
different findings in its poll.
According to GP, doctors are swinging to the Liberal Democrats who have the
support of 36 per cent, against 33 per cent for the Tories and 30 per cent
for Labour. The figures from Pulse were Tories 29.8 per cent, Lib Dems 24.8
and Labour 17.8.
The GP poll was taken before John Smith announced his tax plans, which could
have made a difference to voting intentions. Either way, doctors' support
for the Tories has fallen sharply since the last general election: from 45
per cent according to Pulse, and from 61 per cent according to GP.

FT  07 APR 92 / Election 1992: Polls apart - Ballot Box
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Quality Fieldwork, the Birmingham-based market-research organisation, has
been upsetting a few candidates in the election campaign with polls that
have predicted larger swings to Labour in some marginal seats than reflected
in national polls.
The latest victim is Anthony Beaumont-Dark in Birmingham Selly Oak. The poll
showed 45 per cent of voters backing Labour, pointing to a majority of more
than 3,000 for Lynne Jones, the Labour candidate.
A poll in Birmingham Northfield last week recorded a 14 per cent swing to
Labour, leading to disbelief among party workers supporting Roger King, the
defending Tory MP.
Earlier it was the Liberal Democrats fighting the Tory-held seat of
Birmingham Yardley who were angry. A poll showed them in third place behind
the Conservatives when they were convinced they were running for victory.
Fiona Welch, a partner at Quality Fieldwork, which has been working for the
Birmingham Post and Mail, said that the polls had developed techniques used
accurately to predict the Mid-Staffordshire by-election defeat for the
Conservatives in 1990. 'We are standing our ground,' she said.

FT  07 APR 92 / Election 1992: Boundaries all over the place - Ballot Box
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The case for getting on with the next review of constituency boundaries as
soon as the general election is out of the way is overwhelming. As a look at
the electoral registers shows, the difference in the size of the electorate
from constituency to constituency can be more than two to one.
It is a well-known fact that as a percentage of the population Scotland is
over-represented in Westminster, but so is London. The two English
constituencies with the smallest rolls are Kensington (42,327) and
neighbouring Chelsea (42,549). A lot of the other low figures come from the
capital: Greenwich (48,225) and Hendon South (48,816).
Some of the London suburbs are also exceptionally low: for example, Surbiton
(42,845) and Walthamstow (49,603). Edward Heath's constituency of Old Bexley
and Sidcup has only 50,064.
These figures are wildly out of line by any standards. The ideal size for a
constituency electoral register is generally reckoned to be around 75,000,
give or take local factors.
The Isle of Wight, which is a special case, has the biggest with 101,492:
the island is not quite large enough to be split.
In the rest of England, the biggest constituency is Huntingdon (94,077)
where the Tory candidate is John Major. By contrast, Margaret Thatcher would
be facing an electorate of only 53,322 if she were standing again in her old
London constituency of Finchley.

FT  07 APR 92 / Election 1992: Rise in jobless hits Tory seats
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE overwhelming majority of constituencies in which unemployment has risen
since the 1987 general election are Conservative-held, according to the
Unemployment Unit, a research group that campaigns for the jobless.
Unemployment nationally is lower than before the 1987 election, but it has
risen in 261 constituencies of which the Tories are defending 87 per cent.
Unemployment is higher in 108 of the 112 constituencies in the south-east,
72 out of 84 London constituencies and 15 out of 20 constituencies in East
Anglia.
Unemployment is lower in every constituency in Scotland, and in all but two
in Wales.

MR TOM KING, the defence secretary, yesterday warned voters in north-east
Scotland that the two RAF bases in the area would ultimately close if
Scotland became independent under the Scottish National party.
The two bases, Lossiemouth and Kinloss, are in the Moray constituency where
Mrs Margaret Ewing, the SNP's parliamentary leader, is defending the seat.
Between them the bases employ about 5,000 military and civilian personnel
and are an important source of secondary employment.

THE Church of Scotland yesterday entered the election debate with a strongly

The annual report of the church and nation committee says the human cost of
unemployment is unacceptable, and that last year's comment by Mr Norman
Lamont, the chancellor, that unemployment was 'a price worth paying' to
bring down inflation, was 'hollow and cynical'.

FT  07 APR 92 / Election 1992: Baker warns of rightwing extremism
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Kenneth Baker, the home secretary, last night sought to raise the spectre
of rising immigration and an upsurge in rightwing extremism if the
Conservatives lose the general election, Philip Stephens writes.
His comments brought immediate charges from opposition leaders that he was
deliberately 'scare-mongering'. His remarks were condemned by Mr Paddy
Ashdown, the Liberal Democrat leader, and Mr Roy Hattersley, the shadow home
secretary.
Mr Baker, in a speech which linked the alleged opposition of the Labour and
Liberal Democrat parties to tight controls on political asylum with the
possibility of electoral reform, said that Britain could see the emergence
of fascist movements comparable with those in Germany and France.
He said that recent German regional elections, in which the extreme
rightwing Republicans gained seats with nearly 11 per cent of the vote, were
a warning as to what could happen.
The rise of the right in continental Europe had been linked inextricably to
a flood of migrants and asylum-seekers. Only the Conservatives would offer
tough laws to prevent that occurring in Britain.
Mr Baker said that the situation in Germany could not happen under Britain's
electoral system. Proportional representation made it easier for extremist
minorities to gain power.
He concluded: 'Proportional representation has helped the fascists to march
again in Europe. It is a terrible warning to us about what could happen if
we threw away our system of first-past-the-post election.'

FT  07 APR 92 / Election 1992: Kinnock makes employment top priority
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL, Business Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR NEIL Kinnock yesterday made an immediate reduction in unemployment his
first priority for a Labour government and said he was not prepared to
abandon the ambition of 'a fully working economy'.
In spite of the party's recent efforts to reduce expectations that full
employment remains an attainable objective, Mr Kinnock said he wanted
eventually to ensure that there were 'jobs available for just about
everybody who is looking for a job'.
He acknowledged that the target of full employment 'might miss by three
quarters to 1m' depending on the demand for skills and the impact of
technological change, but it was possible to move towards it. His remarks
followed a lecture to businessmen and academics on a day when senior Labour
figures lined up to attack the government's failure to combat the recession
and to claim Labour alone would end it.
Mr John Smith, the shadow chancellor, said Labour knew the recession 'will
not cure itself' and that the voters realised time was up for a 'do-nothing,
no-change government'.
Mrs Margaret Beckett, shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, said
independent forecasters accepted that Labour policies would lead to higher
growth and lower unemployment.
Mr Kinnock said in his lecture that the past 13 years had represented 'a
vicious circle of low investment and falling competitiveness, leading in
turn to lower investment'.
The government, he said, had built its economic strategy around the
proposition that the only economic task of government was to pursue an
anti-inflationary policy and it had no responsibility for the supply side of
the economy 'other than to undertake deregulation, privatisation and tax
cuts as often as possible'.
He denied suggestions that his party's plans for personal taxation would
hinder economic recovery and said the proposed tax rates compared favourably
with those in Europe.
The Tories, however, seized on a remark later in the day by Mr Kinnock to
claim that he had admitted the Tories' argument that higher taxes would kill
the recovery.
In an interview with Channel 4 news, Mr Kinnock said: 'The state of the
public finances is bad, and to respond to that by increasing taxes would be
very deflationary and push us deeper into recession - that must be wrong.'
Mr Chris Patten, the Tory party chairman, said that Mr Kinnock 'stands
condemned by his own words.'
Mr Kinnock said that Labour's proposed Budget would this year halt growth in
unemployment and reduce the number of jobless by 300,000 in 1993. Growth in
real earnings would be 50 per cent higher as a result of Labour's plans.

FT  07 APR 92 / Election 1992: Political advertising may not be working -
Gary Mead finds that the message seems to be falling short of the medium
</HEADLINE>

   TO SPEND Pounds 30m on marketing
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
as collectively the three main parties will probably have done by April 10 -
with little impact on ratings might seem evidence of very poor planning. But
the tighter the race, the more dervish-like will be the marketing frenzy.
Each party has recruited commercially successful advertising agents but the
view among a number of seasoned advertising people is that none of the
parties is shining.
The Liberal Democrats use the agency TBWA-Holmes Knight Ritchie, with the
effervescent Alasdair Ritchie at the helm. Labour has assembled a team with
Chris Powell - described as 'coldly intellectual and very private' - of BMP
DDP Needham, and the reticent Philip Gould of Philip Gould Associates. The
Conservatives have again opted for Saatchi &amp; Saatchi, with the equally
distant Charles Saatchi pondering the posters.
However, talent and experience cannot compensate for fundamental flaws. The
first requirement of any advertising agency is a clear outline of the
client's strategy: what is the product and what is to be said about it?
According to some experienced London-based advertising executives, none of
the three main parties seems to have developed such a core brief. More
importantly, the financially stronger Conservative party - with perhaps
Pounds 20m to spend against Labour's Pounds 8m and the Liberal Democrats'
Pounds 2m - is not, apparently, getting value for money.
Adam Lury, of Howell Henry Chaldecott Lury, believes Conservative
advertising has failed compared with that of the other main parties. He
said: 'What they (the Conservatives) got right in previous campaigns was to
pull out a salient image, to touch a nerve. 'Labour isn't working' (in 1979)
was a crystal-clear image. They haven't produced anything like that this
time.'
Gary Duckworth, of Duckworth, Finn, Grubb, Waters, said: 'The Tories had one
great hit before the election started - 'Labour's Tax Bombshell'. They
handled it perfectly, the poster said one thing, the broadcast followed up
and the media analysis was forced to really focus on Labour's tax proposals.
I thought, 'here comes the Tory election machine in its oiled magnificence',
but now they seem to have completely lost it.'
Shaun Woodward, the Conservative party's communications director, denies
that Conservative advertising has been negative. The party has started
running full-page advertisements in national tabloid newspapers, one of
which features a 10-point list of Conservative 'achievements' under the
slogan 'Everything Britain Has Won, Labour Would Lose'.
The Tories are also using 7,000 poster sites carrying large images of John
Major amid smiling children, with the slogan 'The Best Future For Britain',
a more positive image than they have used for much of the campaign.
Mr Woodward said: 'One thing that's always a marker of a Conservative
campaign is that they peak at the right moment - on polling day.'
Brendan Bruce, Conservative party communications chief under Margaret
Thatcher, believes the Conservatives' poor showing in the polls reflects a
much deeper problem than whether a particular advertisement is considered
effective.
He said: 'The Tory party has failed to take the media along with its
emphasis on negative campaigning. The problem is not the execution of the
strategy but the strategy itself.'
Mr Duckworth supports that. He said: 'Labour have got a coherent strategy,
like it or not.' Labour's slogan, 'It's Time For A Change - It's Time For
Labour', underlined in red, had been a consistent part of its campaign.
However, he feels the advertising has been weak overall. He said: 'I don't
think that Labour, the Conservatives or the Liberal Democrats have thus far
come up with an image of the potency or simplicity of 'Labour Isn't
Working'. It's still the definitive political ad.'
Robin Wight, of WCRS, is a former Conservative candidate. He says the
party's marketing is doing an excellent job in a grave economic context.
With recession, unemployment and a depressed housing market, the party's
advertising had worked well in keeping down Labour's lead.
Barry Day of Lintas, who was once a speechwriter for former prime minister
Edward Heath, said he looked at what the parties were doing with 'a degree
of horror'. He said: 'It's very 1970s in advertising terms. Big images,
heavy typeset words, almost all verbal puns. The voter, I suspect, will find
it far too clever - communication people's communications.'
Carol Reay, of Reay Keating Hamer, said: 'The conduct of the campaign on the
advertising front has been atrocious. The campaign is just so squabbly,
although the Liberal Democrats are a shining light by comparison with Labour
and the Tories. Our research shows that people like the Lib Dem advertising
a lot.'
The Liberal Democrats have run a consistent theme - the yellow circle with
'My Vote' adorns all posters and advertisements - but there has been
confusion about what it actually means.
Carol Reay believes that many electors are now quite jaundiced. He said:
'Political advertising in the main is just 'let me tell you a completely
biased fact' and there isn't much control.
'When you are talking about the very democratic process of this nation you'd
think it would be a bit more important than washing powder and aftershave.'

FT  07 APR 92 / Election 1992: Natural Law springs a surprise in the poster
war
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARY MEAD, Marketing Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BIG surprise of the poster war has been the sudden late emergence of the
Natural Law party, which since last Thursday has booked more than 6,500
poster sites across the UK at a cost of some Pounds 250,000.
Mr Alan Simmons, managing director of Concord Posterlink, the UK's largest
specialist outdoor buying agency, was 'fully contemplating red-hot news at
the end of the campaign but it's just not there' - the main parties have not
increased their weight of posters from one week ago.
Mr Simmons' company completed its latest intelligence gathering yesterday.
It revealed that the Conservatives were occupying 4,500 48-sheet sites,
Labour 2,200 and the Liberal Democrats 500 - the same figures as at the end
of March. The Natural Law party has spent its money on buying much smaller
32-sheet, 16-sheet and four-sheet poster sites.
A further surprise for Mr Simmons has been the failure so far of leading
brewers to step in and hand over pre-booked sites to the Conservatives -
'the first time for many decades that has not happened'.
Concord Posterlink's research indicates the Conservatives have spent most on
posters, about Pounds 1 1/2 m throughout the campaign, with Labour (Pounds
750,000) and the Liberal Democrats (Pounds 175,000) trailing. Mr Simmons
described the Conservative poster campaign as 'saturation coverage'; a
typical large consumer product might occupy some 2,000 48-sheet sites for a
month, or at most 3,500 for one week.
According to Mr Simmons 'it is getting a bit too late for any of the parties
to organise a late blitz on the poster front'. He expected no dramatic
changes in the advertising campaign in the last few days.
The Conservative party yesterday launched a new poster which attempts a
positive image. It features a beaming John Major next to smiling
schoolchildren. However, by yesterday afternoon the graffiti artists in
north London had already been out in force, adding a neat, small black
moustache to Mr Major's face.

FT  07 APR 92 / Election 1992: Major flies flag of threat to Union - Philip
Stephens on how 'gut' instincts prompted a campaign switch
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE journalists who trooped into Conservative Central Office yesterday
morning were not alone in voicing surprise at Mr John Major's choice of the
constitution as the topic for the start of the final phase of the Tory
campaign.
Some of his senior colleagues were equally perplexed that the prime
minister, faced with a 2-point Labour lead in the opinion polls, had not
chosen to shift the election debate to the more resonant ground of the
economy.
In fact, the sudden change of tack provided another sign of how Mr Major has
come to prefer his 'gut' instincts to the advice of the party's
professionals. It offered a glimpse also of the tensions that have arisen
between Downing Street and Tory Central Office as the Conservative campaign
has stumbled through the past three weeks.
Instead of focusing his attack on Labour's policies on mortgage rates and
its programme for economic recovery, Mr Major chose to dwell for the second
successive day on the threat it would pose to the integrity of the
constitution.
Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, was summoned at short notice from
his Oxfordshire constituency to lend his weight to the presentation. The
launch of the last-minute campaign to warn voters that a Labour victory
would turn economic recovery into slump was postoned until today. Miffed
campaign strategists at Central Office said it was not the first time that
Downing Street had upset their plans.
Mr Major warned that the Scottish assembly proposed by Labour and by the
Liberal Democrats would foreshadow the break-up of the union. The opposition
parties' enthusiasm for a federal Europe would surrender the independence of
Westminster to Brussels.
The proportional voting system advocated by Mr Paddy Ashdown and flirted
with by Mr Neil Kinnock would be a recipe for weak and indecisive government
in which backroom deals prevailed over the will of the people.
With a passion he has displayed rarely throughout the campaign, Mr Major
concluded that, taken together, the policies would represent a real threat
to the future of the United Kingdom - so the choice on Thursday was one that
transcended normal party political differences.
Close colleagues said that apocalyptic vision was not something conjured up
by the party's image-makers. Just as Mr Major had decided that a soapbox
provided a better medium than the orchestrated events that dominated the
start of his campaign, so now he believed he had found a message to
articulate the importance of the election.
One aide said last night: 'He feels immensely strongly about the
constitution and the authority of Westminster and is determined to put that
across to the voters.'
Many of his colleagues, however, are less than convinced that it is a
strategy that can pull the Conservatives back from the verge of defeat on
Thursday.
They agree that it might persuade some disaffected Conservatives to switch
their support back from the Liberal Democrats.
A parallel warning from Mr Hurd that a hung parliament would let Mr Kinnock
into Downing Street was directed at the same group of waverers. There is
also a chance that waving the flag might also reinforce working-class
support in the south-east.
As they contemplate the prospect of the end of 13 years of office, the
general view among ministers is that Scotland, electoral reform and Europe
are not the issues to set voters rushing to the Conservative cause.
If Mr Major is to defy the polls and return to Downing Street on Friday
morning, it will be because the electorate fears Labour's economic policies
more than it resents the Conservatives' recession.
So his colleagues will be relieved when Mr Major returns this morning to
concentrating on tax, mortgage rates and the promise of economic recovery.

FT  07 APR 92 / Fed plan for sale of First American
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN FRIEDMAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US Federal Reserve Board plans to propose that a special trusteeship be
created to allow the sale of First American Bankshares, the troubled
Washington-based bank that was secretly and illegally controlled by the
collapsed Bank of Credit and Commerce International (BCCI).
A US official said the plan was discussed yesterday by federal officials at
a meeting in Washington. The aim would be to allow First American to be
recapitalised as soon as possible.
The bank, BCCI's biggest US investment, suffered a more than doubled 1991
loss of Dollars 358m (Pounds 208.1m) and needs to raise new capital
immediately. Its equity base shrank last year from Dollars 711m to Dollars
422m, while total assets dropped to Dollars 8.4bn from Dollars 11bn in 1990.
Deposits at First American, which operates in four states, fell from Dollars
9bn to Dollars 7.1bn last year as worried depositors withdrew funds from the
six banks owned by the group.
The trusteeship plan would implement a March 1991 Fed order instructing BCCI
to divest itself of shares in First American held by Credit &amp; Commerce
American Holdings NV (CCAH), an offshore holding vehicle that featured
several nominee shareholders described by the Fed last year as 'front men'
for BCCI.
The move would almost certainly rekindle the dispute over First American's
ownership, as it could trigger responses from BCCI figures such as Sheikh
Kemal Adham, a key shareholder and former head of Saudi Arabia's
intelligence service.
The plan, which may require a court ruling, could also affect the government
of Abu Dhabi, which holds 28 per cent of First American and was also
majority owner of BCCI, now in liquidation.
A US official familiar with the Fed plan said the aim was to allow the bank
to be sold, possibly placing the cash proceeds into an escrow account.
First American has not been accused of any wrongdoing, although
congressional investigators are still looking into the types of accounts
maintained at the bank by the Central Intelligence Agency.

FT  07 APR 92 / Caterpillar strikers defiant: Company's deadline passes for

THE United Auto Workers' five-month-old strike at Caterpillar, the world's
largest maker of earth-moving equipment, appears to have held firm yesterday
morning, despite a deadline set by the company for workers to return.
The company, based in Peoria, Illinois, has demanded that all striking
workers return under the terms of their last contract offer or risk losing
their jobs.
It said if striking union members failed to come back to work, it would
begin recalling laid-off employees and hiring permanent replacements.
Only a modest number of the 12,600 striking workers were reported to have
crossed picket lines by the deadline yesterday morning. By Caterpillar's
estimate, more than 300 workers had crossed the lines. The company said it
was encouraged by the number that returned.
No violent incidents were reported despite widespread anger among union
members. The UAW's main branch in Peoria said that non-stop meetings were
held through the weekend to calm irate workers. Mr Jerry Baker, chief of the
UAW's local bargaining committee, said that emotions were running high and
that the union was trying to avert any violence at company gates.
'It's a very volatile situation and I'm afraid that just a spark could set
things off,' said Mr Baker.
The company said the deadline was only the beginning of a process and that
it expected that more strikers would return to work in the days ahead.
It also acknowledged the union's frequently repeated claim that it will be
difficult to find replacements for Caterpillar's highly skilled workforce
and that training would have to be fairly extensive.

FT  07 APR 92 / Fujimori wins support in dissolving Congress
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Alberto Fujimori's decision to dissolve Peru's Congress, with the
backing of his joint chiefs of staff, appears to have won broad popular
backing, according to reports from Lima yesterday.
But for parliamentarians and political analysts the move strengthened fears
that Mr Fujimori intends to install a civilian-military dictatorship.
Peruvian Prime Minister Alfonso de los Heros announced he and his entire
cabinet were resigning in what appeared to be a protest, according to local
radio.
Coming only weeks after a failed coup in Venezuela, Mr Fujimori's crackdown
has revived doubts about the strength of democracy in Latin America as a
whole.
Justifying his action in a surprise late-night TV broadcast, Mr Fujimori
accused legislators of trying to block free-market reforms and failing to
take tough measures against terrorists and drug-traffickers.
He suspended the constitution and ordered detention of opposition leaders,
including former President Alan Garcia, while troops were sent to guard
radio stations and newspapers, and tanks patrolled streets in the capital.
Mr Garcia was reported to have evaded arrest after a tip-off.
The suspension of the constitution brought international condemnation. The
White House said it was 'a regrettable step backwards' for democracy and US
aid to Peru was put under review.
Repeating recent criticism of Peru's legislature and judiciary, Mr Fujimori
said 'chaos and corruption' were shackling government attempts to achieve
'the objectives of national reconstruction and development'.
His campaign against Congress appeared to have struck a chord among the
Peruvian people and in the streets there were expressions of support for him
and no signs of resistance.
The president said he would call a national referendum to create a 'new
legislative structure' but gave no date.
Cambio 90, the party created by Mr Fujimori when he began his 1990
presidential campaign, has long been in disarray. With only 27
representatives in the 180-seat lower house and 12 in the 60-seat senate,
they are no match for the opposition, even when, rarely, they are united.
Parliamentarians have become increasingly opposed to a president they deem
authoritarian, who consistently vilifies them. After 20 months of austerity,
debilitated left-wing parties are gathering strength. The poor have seen no
reward for belt-tightening and businessmen are becoming disenchanted with
ultra-liberalism that has left them unprotected as never before.
Lacking a broad base, Mr Fujimori has drawn ever closer to the military. In
decrees last November he gave them a freer hand in the 11-year-old war
against Sendero Luminoso, the Maoist guerrilla group.
Stephen Fidler in Santo Domingo adds: The first apparent effect of the US
review of financial assistance to Peru was postponement of two loans
totalling Dollars 221m from the Inter-American Development Bank.
The loans were due to be signed yesterday at the bank's annual meeting in
the Dominican Republic. The bank said only that signing of the loan accords,
meant to encourage reform of Peru's investment regime, was delayed for
'technical reasons'.
Any decision by the US to suspend assistance could put in jeopardy a
complicated arrangement designed to bring Peru out of arrears with the IMF
and other international financial institutions. If this happens, Peru's
financial position would worsen significantly, jeopardising Mr Fujimori's
economic reform efforts.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE Inter-American Investment Corporation (IIC), the affiliate of the
Inter-American Development Bank set up to stimulate private sector
development in Latin America, is facing difficulties in expanding
operations.
It needs to borrow about Dollars 220m (Pounds 128m) from its parent to
expand, having committed Dollars 175m to investments since start-up in 1990.
It has paid-in capital of Dollars 200m and can borrow that amount plus its
accumulated reserves.
However, the bank is apparently only able to lend to the corporation at the
floating interest rate it lends to member countries.
Some IIC officials think this may be too high for the early phase of an
organisation which concentrates on relatively high-risk private-sector
operations.
Mr Gunther Muller, IIC general manager, has said he expects informal
discussions to start over an increase in capital for the corporation in
Santo Domingo. These talks would probably run parallel with the IADB capital
increase.
He described the corporation's operations so far as a 'pilot project',
adding: 'We should probably be five times as large.'

The state-owned Hellenic Industrial Development Bank (ETVA), in charge of
the venture, said yesterday that the new partner would have to contribute at

A consortium led by GEC-Alsthom, the Anglo-French power company, yesterday
won a Pounds 550m contract to build a power station in southern China,
writes Simon Holberton in Hong Kong.
The order - for two 655MW coal-fired units - was placed by a joint venture
company owned by Guangdong General Power Company and Hopewell Energy, a
subsidiary of Mr Gordon Wu's Hopewell Holdings.
The units, to be known as Shajiao C, will be built in the Pearl River delta,
60 miles south of Guangzhou. In keeping with Mr Wu's reputation for speedy
construction, the first unit is due for completion within 33 months and the
second just three months later.
GEC-Alsthom is responsible for the design and engineering of that power
station and for the supply and commissioning of the steam turbines and
balance of the plant. A subsidiary of Hopewell, Slipform Engineering, will
carry out the civil engineering work and ABB Combustion Engineering will
supply the boiler islands. About Pounds 300m of the work will be carried out
in Europe, the vast bulk in the UK.
Guangdong is the fastest growing region in China.

<TEXT>
SUCCESSFUL completion of the Uruguay Round of negotiations on world trade
liberalisation is 'the key prerequisite' for future growth in the
international chemicals industry, according to Sir Denys Henderson, chairman
of ICI.
He challenged recent forecasts by the International Monetary Fund and the
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development that the world
economy would soon emerge from recession, insisting it would take until the
second half of the 1990s for strong growth to return.
This would lift world production of chemicals by 50 per cent to about
Dollars 1,500bn (in today's dollars) (Pounds 860bn) by the year 2000, he
predicted. Strongest growth would come in the Asia Pacific region, which is
set to become as important a market as Europe, and in eastern Europe, which
is at present a virgin market, but would rise to Dollars 150bn by 2000.
Without trade reforms, output would fall 'well short' of these predictions.
'In my 35 years' experience of international business, I have never seen
greater uncertainties about the short-to-medium term outlook,' Sir Denys
told a Paris conference on world trade and investment. 'Surely it is
completely unacceptable, with 85 per cent of the many complex trade problems
already settled (in the Uruguay Round) that the agricultural issues which
require to be resolved should be allowed to jeopardise the 93 per cent of
the world trade not related to agriculture.'
His comments follow a call last week by the International Council of
Chemical Associations (ICCA) for swift resolution of the trade talks, which
began in 1986 and have been stalled for 15 months. Mr Arthur Dunkel,
director general of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, conceded
recently that the Easter deadline for completion of the talks is likely to
be missed.
The ICCA, claiming to represent 70 per cent of the world chemicals industry,
says the sector is already affected by delay. 'The industry is global and
depends on open markets and agreed international rules,' it said and warned
of emerging bilateralism and discriminatory trade regimes if the Uruguay
Round failed.
The chemicals industry, along with pharmaceuticals, has offered worldwide
harmonisation of tariffs at 5.5 to 6.5 per cent, and the abolition of
non-tariff barriers. In exchange, wants more protection for patents, and
more freedom to invest internationally.
This need is well illustrated by ICI, one of the world's largest chemicals
companies, which has more than half of its annual sales of Ecu 18bn (Pounds
13bn) outside Europe, manufactures in 40 countries, and has sales operations
in 150.
After slow growth in the first half of the 1990s, Sir Denys sees chemicals
output growing to about Dollars 500bn by the end of the decade - a rise of
about 39 per cent from Dollars 360bn in 1991. The US will grow by a more
modest 30 per cent, from Dollars 270bn in 1991 to Dollars 350bn.
Portugal, which holds the EC presidency, will call a meeting of EC ministers
on Gatt talks before Mr Anibal Cavaco Silva, prime minister, and Mr Jacques
Delors, EC commission president, visit Washington on April 22, Reuter
reports from Lisbon.

FT  07 APR 92 / EC lifts embargo on oil exports to South Africa
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Community yesterday lifted its ban on oil sales to South
Africa, and paved the way for renewed sporting, cultural and scientific
links.
The moves brought an instant welcome from Dr Bhadra Ranchod, South Africa's
ambassador to the EC, who said his country had had to compensate for the
embargo by spending more on synthetic fuels, on stockpiling oil imported
from other sources, and on prospecting for oil within South Africa and its
waters.
EC oil companies established in South Africa, such as Shell and BP, would be
far freer to operate there, Dr Ranchod said.
The decision paves the way for countries such as Germany, the Netherlands
and Belgium to re-negotiate the cultural accords they broke off in 1985 when
United Nations and EC sanctions were stepped up. South African academics and
students will also have easier access to European universities, Dr Ranchod
said.
The only remaining EC sanctions on South Africa are those mandated by the UN
Security Council banning the sale of arms to, and the exchange of military
attaches with, South Africa.
Oil industry operators in South Africa welcomed the unexpected announcement,
but noted that the Community's decision will have limited financial impact.
For the past few years South Africa has been buying its crude at world
prices, paying little if any premium. The diminished impact of the embargo
was already evident last year when the government announced it would sell
part of its strategic reserve to finance social upliftment.
It will, however, allow South Africa to diversify its sources of supply. The
country will also be able to trade crude oil products openly. What remains
unclear is the extent to which yesterday's announcement will undermine the
United Nations embargo which remains.
Locally, it will provide added impetus for the decentralisation of oil
procurement, which has been controlled by the Central Energy Fund.
Shipping Research Bureau, an Amsterdam based monitoring group, estimated
that South Africa's oil imports cost Dollars 1.6bn in 1989. Demand is about
30 per cent below that of the mid-1970s due mainly to progress made by South
Africa in achieving a level of self-sufficiency through developing a
synthetic fuel industry which converts coal to oil and gas.
Deborah Hargreaves adds: Oil traders do not believe the EC move will have
much impact on world prices. 'We could see some temporary distortions in the
trade flows of certain oil products,' said Mr Joe Stanislaw of Cambridge
Energy Research Associates, 'but there will be no huge spate of demand
opened up.'

FT  07 APR 92 / Seeking peace in an Afghan minefield: Farhan Bokhari
examines obstacles to a settlement on the last Cold War battlefront
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FARHAN BOKHARI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE WAR will be brought to an end soon in neighbouring Afghanistan, say
Pakistani officials and diplomats in Islamabad. This has proved hard enough,
they say, but building peace there will be even more difficult.
Spearheading the peace drive on the last battleground of the Cold War is the
UN secretary-general's Afghanistan troubleshooter, Mr Benon Sevan. He has
spent the last few weeks shuttling around the region trying to organise a
meeting of representatives of the warring parties to choose an interim
government.
The first step would be an assembly of 12 to 24 'mutually acceptable'
representatives which would meet in Geneva or Vienna by the end of this
month. An interim administration would then be required to hold elections to
pave the way for a new government in Kabul.
Meanwhile, the futility of the conflict Mr Sevan is trying to bring to an
end is evident in the eastern town of Khost, taken by the Mujahideen rebels
last spring in what was supposedly their most significant victory of the
war. Countless thousands of guerrillas and government troops died during the
two-week battle for this sprawling clutter of tumbledown mud dwellings.
After 'liberating' the town the Mujahideen looted it of virtually everything
that could be carried off.  Even doors and window frames were removed.
A year on, the debris of the battle - rusting tanks, crippled army trucks,
spent artillery casings and clumps of half-buried uniforms - still litters
the streets, many made impassable by huge bomb craters. Apart from the
occasional patrol of Kalashnikov-toting Mujahideen, there is little sign of
life.
Clearing the mines is a vital first step back towards normality. A fifth of
the war's million-plus fatalities were killed by mines; twice as many again
have been maimed by them. At the going rate it will take 40 years to make
the country safe. But a UN-supervised mine clearance programme begun in 1990
is threatened by a dire shortage of funds. Though run on a shoestring
budget, only a third of the Dollars 15.6m needed this year has been secured.
Clearance teams came to Khost last September at the request of the
Mujahideen. Depleted though the area is, half a dozen people are still being
killed or disabled by mines each day.
Two events this year have moved the peace process forward: first, Pakistan
formally ended its support for a military victory by the Mujahideen. That at
last ended the involvement of Islamabad's powerful ISI (Inter-Services
Intelligence) agency, long believed to be the most important channel for
arms and equipment to the Mujahideen.
However, the announcement last monthby Mr Najibullah, the Afghan president,
that he would step down and hand over power to an interim government,
removed the most important objection to peace talks from the Mujahideen.
Hardliners and moderates among them have demanded for long that no
settlement would be acceptable to them as long as the president remained in
power.
The end of the war and formation of a new government in Kabul would still
leave the task of rebuilding a war-torn country. The UN has appealed for at
least 100,000 tonnes of wheat to overcome severe food shortages. That
includes 30,000 tonnes for Kabul alone, where 1m people survive on food
coupons. 'The silos are empty: do we start digging cemeteries?' is how Mr
Sevan described it.
One Pakistani official said: 'The big powers were keen to finance the war
which brought about this catastrophe. Sadly, they are less likely to finance
the peace and rebuilding of Afghanistan, because the east-west power game is
not involved.'
While the chances of a settlement have never been more promising, some
diehard guerrilla leaders, such as Hezbi-i-Islami's Gulbuddin Hekmatyar,
appear to want to continue the fight.
In a statement yesterday the Hezbi said it would 'not accept any (Afghan)
government imposed by foreign forces'. It denied having joined the UN peace
process.
Last week Mr Sevan said: 'We cannot have 100 per cent unanimity. Nobody from
any group should think they can stop the process, because otherwise you'd
never start.'

FT  07 APR 92 / A million must move for China's next great wall: Yvonne
Preston surveys some of the human and environmental costs of the Three
Gorges Dam project
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By YVONNE PRESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN THE middle reaches of the majestic Yangtze river, sheer cliff faces and
mountains rise from turbulent waters to form the Three Gorges, an
inspiration to Chinese poets and artists down the centuries.
One of the world's scenic wonders, it is the site of the planned Three
Gorges dam, an engineering project - given the go-ahead by the Chinese
parliament last Friday - which will not only change the landscape forever,
but cost more than 1m people their homes, and swamp 23,800 hectares of
arable land, 657 factories and mines, 139 power stations and 956km of roads.
The scheme, incorporating the biggest hydro-power station and largest
ship-lift in the world and an unprecedented five ship locks, is costed at
57bn yuan (Pounds 6bn) at 1990 prices. Such is the controversy surrounding
it that a third of the deputies in the normally tame National People's
Congress failed to give it their rubber-stamp vote.
The Three Gorges - Qutang, Wuxia and Xiling - will be dominated by the
reservoir which will stretch out behind the 185-metre high dam when it
reaches the proposed 175-metre water level 15 years from the start of
construction. The 600km reservoir will be a tranquil body of water, twice
the width of the present turbulent river, improved navigation being one of
the project's proclaimed benefits.
Others are flood control in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze  -
and power, for which China has an insatiable appetite. The project will
generate 84bn kw/h of hydro-electric power a year, one-eighth of China's
1991 output.
The water level in Qutang, the smallest and most westerly of the Three
Gorges, only 100 metres wide at its narrowest point, is set to rise 90
metres. In the hillside town of Wanxian at the western approach to the
Gorges, population 30,000, the level the water will reach is marked on
buildings. Few will be above.
The town will be re-built back from the river with some of the 18.5bn yuan
allocated to resettlement from the project's budget of 57bn yuan. Some
private scepticism was expressed in Wanxian county, which has a high
proportion of all the people to be moved, that the money promised by the
central government would be forthcoming.
The reservoir will flood 19 counties and municipalities in the two provinces
of Sichuan and Hubei, swamping hundreds of populated areas, including the
cities of Wanxian and Fuling with 100,000 people. Altogether 140 towns and
hundreds of villages are to go, though officials claim none will be totally
submerged.
The dam will cost 1.13m people their homes by the time the project nears
completion in the year 2008. Tang Dengqing from the Yangtze River Water
Resources Commission in Wuhan, responsible for helping to plan new cities
and towns and develop barren land for displaced farmers, says moving so many
people is unparalleled in the world. It is the most serious of all problems
associated with the dam, he says.
Sites have been chosen for the new cities and an overall broad plan mapped.
Experiments in moving have been conducted, though reports say people show
reluctance to go. The new county town of Badong, 2km from the original site,
has basically taken shape after five years construction.
Those to be resettled from urban areas - 60 per cent of the total - are less
of a problem than peasant farmers, says Tang. Scratching a poor living from
terraced plots often high on mountain sides, they must now be moved higher
to still less hospitable land.
There are also conflicts of interest between provinces. Hubei province,
down-river of the dam gains from flood control, cheap power and new jobs,
but has only 15 per cent of the people to be displaced.
Upriver of the dam the much poorer and heavily populated Sichuan province
gets 10 per cent of the power but is home to the remaining 85 per cent of
the people to be displaced.
Sichuan faces an increased risk of flooding, as the water level up-river
rises. There is an additional risk that the accumulation of silt will affect
navigation to Chongqing, Sichuan's largest port. Deputy director of the
Three Gorges project office in the city, economist Sun Lai Yan, says 50,000
people within the municipal area will have to move. Many have urged the
government to do more research on the project before going ahead.
The governor of Sichuan province, Zhang Haoruo, cast his vote for the dam at
the weekend, but even he acknowledges the majority of Sichuanese are
opposed.
There have been rumours, officially denied, that elder statesman Deng
Xiaoping, born in Sichuan, had expressed reservations.
Through the 40 years of debate since the project was first proposed,
uncertainty has inhibited development along the affected area, which remains
poor and lacking in investment funds. The point is re-iterated by official
spokesmen backing the scheme. Critics remain concerned about the risk of
reservoir-induced earthquakes, the threat of river banks collapsing, and the
accumulation of silt in the first 50 years of operation, affecting
generating capacity and shortening the dam's useful life.
Money is another question. China can afford it, the minister for water
conservancy and power, Yang Zhenhuai, said in Beijing after the vote. Funds
would come from the state, from the generation of power which would begin
nine years after the start of construction, from the sale of bonds and from
preferential foreign loans.
Harnessing the Yangtze has been an aspiration of the Chinese Communist Party
since Mao Zedong visited the dam site in the 1950s. The appeal of an heroic
project to today's leaders is a powerful impetus behind the largest
construction project since the founding of the People's Republic.

FT  07 APR 92 / UK steel town's revival inspires E Germans: East and west
are starting to co-operate on urban regeneration
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON MAITLAND

<TEXT>
EAST Germany's plums have gone. West German companies have piled in and
bought the healthiest industrial plants or set up new operations to capture
local markets.
Now foreigners are being targeted in a hard sell of the rest. On the margins
of big cities such as Berlin and Leipzig lie regions in desperate need of
development if east German living standards are to be hauled up to those of
the west.
Some 300 UK companies and financial institutions have been invited to a
seminar in London today to promote one of those regions, centred on the
industrial city of Schwedt and the medieval market town of Angermunde, 50
miles north-east of Berlin.
The groundwork for this promotion is a case study in how east and west can
co-operate in planning the revival of a downtrodden regional economy, partly
inspired by the experience of the Northamptonshire steel town of Corby.
Marketing a remote corner of east Germany close to the bleak Polish border
is an uphill struggle, especially when potential investors are suffering
their own recession. But Schwedt has little choice. It is threatened by a
haemorrhage of skilled workers to the west.
The PCK oil refinery, focal point of the town of 52,000, once provided
10,000 jobs. By the end of next year only 2,600 jobs will remain, as
capacity at the now privatised refinery is slashed and wage and productivity
levels are raised to those of west Germany.
The authorities in Schwedt, together with Angermunde, turned to the west for
help. They hired Mowlem Europe, a division of John Mowlem Construction of
the UK, which opened an office in Berlin in July 1990 and bought Bau-Tec, a
German construction company, last November. Mowlem, in a joint venture with
Conran Roche, UK planning consultants, began work on a development programme
a year ago.
The contract, worth about DM500,000 (Pounds 175,400), was funded from EC
grants to Bonn for the regeneration of east Germany, which reached the
region via the Brandenburg state authorities.
Mr Jim Barrack, business development director of Mowlem Europe, emphasises
the co-operation aspect. 'We didn't want to go in saying 'We know
everything, let us get on with it.' We wanted them to be a part of it
because at the end of the day they have to carry their economy into the new
free market.'
The region was evaluated, the data analysed, and 75 potential projects
covering industry, services, agriculture and infrastructure were drawn up,
requiring an estimated DM70m-DM80m in private sector investment alone. A
dozen priority projects were then highlighted as those 'most likely to be
attractive to the outside world and give benefit to the region.'
The seminar will emphasise the region's strengths: its equidistance from
Berlin and the Polish Baltic port of Szczecin; its location on the river
Oder; its lakes and forests, suitable for leisure and tourism; its natural
resources of timber and sand; its workforce which, though inexperienced in
western managerial and commercial techniques, is skilled and willing.
Most appealing, perhaps, is the hope that it will one day be situated on a
vast east-west trading corridor, and benefit as a commercial hub when the
first countries of eastern Europe join the EC.
Back to today, the reality is one of inadequate roads, a run-down telephone
system, and scarce hotel accommodation. So the investments being sought
range from publicly-funded infrastructure projects - such as a new river
harbour for Schwedt and a feeder road from the A11 north-south motorway - to
private sector ventures such as a food processing plant.
Other regions will be as eager, or desperate, to sell themselves, as Mr
Barrack acknowledges. 'Achieving investment has become highly competitive.
One can't expect to set out a scenario and wait for people to come and knock
on the door.'
That is why creation of an Economic Development Agency is a top priority. It
would direct investments and provide advice, sites, start-up finance, job
creation and links with other countries.
During the study, the Germans were taken to Corby, which was revived as an
enterprise zone after its main employer, the steel mill, closed in 1980 with
huge job losses. It happens that Corby mirrors Schwedt's population of
52,000, and its steelworks also once employed more than 10,000.
'Corby gave them a very bullish presentation about how they tackled the
problems and got new business in, and they found that very encouraging,'
says Mr Barrack.

<TEXT>
GREECE'S conservative government was shaken yesterday after a 35 per cent
swing to the opposition Panhellenic Socialist Movement (Pasok) in an Athens
by-election at the weekend.
The Athens Stock Exchange index dropped by 2 per cent after the final result
was announced, giving Pasok an unexpected 68 per cent of the poll as voters
protested against the government's austerity policy.
The by-election was held in a large suburban Athens constituency where
unemployment is rising and many residents are affected by a public sector
pay freeze imposed by the ruling conservatives.
Mr Andreas Papandreou, the Pasok leader, called on the government to resign,
saying its foreign policy 'is highly dangerous and its economic policy
unpopular and unjust.'
Mr Stefanos Manos, the economy minister, said the government had 'got the
message' but was determined to press on with economic reforms to bring the
Greek economy into line with its EC partners.

FT  07 APR 92 / Italians ignore Andreotti's warning: The prime minister's
party has experienced a serious setback
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DURING the election campaign, Mr Giulio Andreotti, Italy's outgoing
Christian Democrat prime minister, was wont to caution the electorate
against a protest vote with the advice: 'Too many doctors risk killing the
patient.'
Yesterday's early returns suggested the electorate had ignored his caution.
The Christian Democrats have received their first serious electoral reverse
since 1948 as voters switched allegiance to a wide arc of parties. Italy's
11th legislature thus looked certain to contain a greater fragmentation of
political parties, all with differing prescriptions on how to cure the
country's ills.
Although the Christian Democrats will remain the largest party in
parliament, their vote appeared to have fallen below the psychological
barrier of 30 per cent. Prior to the elections, party officials said that
any vote below 30 per cent would be an upset, aware that this would
undermine the party's credibility and post-war political dominance.
The vote is almost certain to reduce the influence of the party to
orchestrate the formation of the next coalition and destroy hopes of
retaining the outgoing four-party alliance with the Socialists, the Liberals
(PLI) and the Social Democrats (PSDI) as a majority. In the outgoing
parliament the latter alliance accounted for 53 per cent of the national
vote and 49 per cent was considered the minimum necessary to form a
government.
The Christian Democrats lost ground to a protest vote, given heavily in the
North to the populist Lombard League. But the vote also reinforced the
standing of the small Republican Party, the Greens, the Radicals and the
Sicily-based reform group, The Network (La Rete). The Christian Democrats
failed to capitalise on the fall of communism. Indeed, the party seemed at a
loss how to adapt its long-standing anti-communist stance.
In contrast, the former communist vote held up well, split between the bulk
who adhered to the new Party of the Democratic Left and the Reconstructed
Communism hardliners. The party had relied upon its well-oiled party machine
to drum up votes; only in the south was it effective. But even here the
Republicans and more particularly La Rete made inroads, largely because of
the Christian Democrats' links with organised crime.
The party is now expected to be under strong pressure to forego some of its
quota of power. Over the years the party has amassed a formidable netowrk of
influence and patronage, well beyond its share of the vote. Rather than
diminish as its vote slipped in general elections from the 1948 high of 48
per cent to a low of 32 per cent in 1983, this power tended to be
consolidated.
In the outgoing administration the Christian Democrats held 17 of the 32
ministerial portfolios and 38 of the 69 under-secretaryships. They held
every key ministry save foreign affairs (in the hands of the Socialists) and
kept a tight control over the security services. Their hold is even greater
in provincial administration, with 17 of the 20 presidents of the regions
being Christian Democrats.
Outside pure politics, the Christian Democrats control their own trade union
federation, the Usl, and their appointees dominate the state corporations
including the state holding company, IRI, which accounts for 5 per cent of
GDP.
A weakening of the Christian Democrat vote implies not just a significant
lessening of their ability to carve up the country distributing favours to
the party faithful. It also raises questions about the leadership of the
party which has failed to detect the changing mood of the nation. In
particular it calls in question the future of Mr Andreotti, 73, who had
hoped to move from the premiership to the presidency.

FT  07 APR 92 / Curfew in Sarajevo as prime minister resigns
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By A Special Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE prime minister of Bosnia-Hercegovina, Mr Jure Pelivan, resigned
yesterday amid continued ethnic battles in the republic. The state
presidency issued a new appeal for a ceasefire and imposed a night curfew in
the capital, Sarajevo.
Mr Pelivan, a Croat who led a coalition with Moslems and Serbs, stepped down
after the worst flare-up of violence in the republic since the Second World
War.
In one incident, snipers, said to be Serb militants, opened fire on peace
protesters in Sarajevo, the capital, for the second day in a row. Five
demonstrators were killed, according to one western newsagency report,
although another could confirm only 15 wounded.
Skirmishes were reported around Kupres, a town taken over by Croat forces.
Unconfirmed radio reports say hundreds of people have been killed or wounded
in Kupres in recent days.
Mr Alija Izetbegovic, the Bosnian president, who is a Moslem, claimed the
bloodshed was the result of Serb efforts to seize territory, destabilise the
republic and thwart its recognition as an independent state.
Serious ethnic clashes in Bosnia have increased since voters overwhelmingly
passed a referendum on independence from the Yugoslav federation last month.
Serbs boycotted the vote and oppose being cut off from Serbia by an
international frontier. Their leaders have warned for more than a year that
such a step would lead to civil war and now advocate breaking the republic
into ethnic cantons.
The Serbs, who account for 32 per cent of Bosnia's 4.3m people, claim 60 per
cent of the republic's territory.
The republic's Moslems and many Croats support independence as they are
reluctant to be linked with what is certain to be a Serb-dominated rump
Yugoslav state.
Exploding mortar shells fell yesterday on Sarajevo's historic, mainly
Moslem-populated bazaar area and outlying areas east of the capital. People
around the city of 700,000 braved sniper fire to watch artillery shells
exploding in the mountains above.
Several thousand demonstrators stormed the Holiday Inn hotel, breaking
windows and searching for gunmen believed to have fired on peace protesters
outside the parliament opposite. Hand grenades exploded inside the building,
which Serb militiamen have been using as a base.
Thousands of peace protesters including tin-helmeted miners occupied
parliament and announced formation of a national salvation committee. They
demanded a referendum, fresh elections and disarming of rival paramilitary
groups.
They appealed for help from the Yugoslav army and from United Nations
peace-keepers who will soon start separating warring Serbs and Croats in
neighbouring Croatia.
The republic's interior minister, Mr Alija Delimustafic, yesterday
repeatedly called on the Yugoslav army to intervene on the side of the
'citizenry' to stop the bloodshed. The army's loyalties remain unclear
despite the fighting around the city.
Yugoslav army infantry units backed by tanks yesterday guarded Sarajevo's
airport. European Community military observers said masked men in camouflage
uniforms who attacked the passenger terminal on Sunday night were driven out
of the airport by Yugoslav army troops.

<TEXT>
MR Alexander Rutskoi, the Russian vice-president, yesterday appealed to the
Congress of Russian People's Deputies to sanction the use of the former
Soviet 14th army - now under Russian control - to establish a buffer zone
along the River Dnestr between warring Moldovans and Russians.
Mr Rutskoi also suggested in a fiercely nationalist speech that Russia might
recognise the self-proclaimed Trans-Dnestr republic, where the Russians are
concentrated.
No vote was taken on his appeal. But it drew a sympathetic response from
many deputies, and shows a substantial number of legislators are willing to
protect by military force the interests of the millions of Russians living
in former Soviet republics.
A foreign ministers' meeting, meanwhile, agreed a ceasefire between Moldovan
government forces and Russian-speaking separatists from this afternoon. The
accord was reached at talks between foreign ministers of Moldova, Russia,
Ukraine and Romania in Kishinev.
Mr Rutskoi, just returned from a visit to the Trans-Dnestr republic, told
congress in Moscow that 'unless Russia guarantees the protection of its
citizens wherever they live . . . there will be military conflict on the
former territory of the Soviet Union and there will be thousands of
refugees, as we already see.'
Mr Rutskoi's visit was opposed by Moldova, which complained that Russia was
interfering in its internal affairs. The Russians in Trans-Dnestr fear that
the Kishinev government will try to incorporate Moldova into Romania; most
of the Moldovan population is ethnic Romanian.
Mr Andrei Kozyrev, the Russian foreign minister, had proposed in Kishinev
that Russia, Ukraine, Moldova and Romania act as guarantors of the
independence and integrity of Moldova, and also of the right to
self-determination of the mainly Russian population on the left bank of the
Dnestr.
The Azerbaijani prime minister, Mr Hasan Hasanov, has been ousted in an
apparent power struggle in the former Soviet republic, Interfax news agency
said yesterday, Reuter reports from Moscow.

THE UN's top environment official said yesterday that damage to the ozone
layer was worse than previously thought and proposed advancing a ban on
ozone-eating chemicals by four years to the start of 1996, Reuter reports
from Geneva.
'The full consequences of our past folly will be painful,' said Dr Mostafa
Tolba, executive director of the UN Environment Programme (UNEP), at the
start of 10 days of UN negotiations to tighten the 1987 Montreal Protocol on
the ozone layer.
Most industrialised regions are so alarmed by new reports demonstrating the
rapid destruction of the protective ozone layer that they will almost
certainly approve a target of 1996 for banning the chemicals, which include
chlorofluorocarbons.

FT  07 APR 92 / Brussels signal to car spares makers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EC MANUFACTURERS of vehicle spare parts risk punishment for unfair
competition if their links with car-makers put independent parts
distributors at a disadvantage, the European Commission indicated yesterday.
An independent French distributor complained to the Commission that Magneti
Marelli, the parts subsidiary of Fiat of Italy, was operating a system which
allowed car-makers to buy replacement carburettors at preferential prices,
for resale through their distribution networks.
Brussels said yesterday it had decided not to go ahead with an investigation
because Magneti Marelli had changed its system to make it less
discriminatory.
But at the same time, the Commission sent a strong signal to all spare parts
manufacturers that discrimination against independent distributors was
unacceptable. ''Partnerships' between car-makers and spare parts
manufacturers must not call into question the survival of distributors of
replacement parts which are independent of car distribution networks.'
Magneti Marelli dominates the French market for replacement parts, with a 63
per cent share. Distributors which were not part of a car-maker's
distribution network were only able to buy replacement carburettors through
an intermediary, at higher prices and on less advantageous terms.
A Commission spokesman said: 'Big car companies buy the carburettors they
install in new cars in bulk, and those are always cheaper.
'But they also get concessionary rates on the parts they use for the spares
market. That's separate, and there are other people who compete only in that
market.'

<TEXT>
FINLAND succeeded in averting a devaluation of its currency yesterday
following the announcement of an emergency economic package at the weekend
and pledges of support from the Bundesbank and the Nordic central banks to
help maintain the value of the markka.
The centre-right government hastily put together a FM10bn (Pounds 1.3bn)
package of cuts in welfare spending in an attempt to calm Finland's panicky
financial markets. Short-term interest rates soared on Friday after a row
between the government and the central bank over policy prompted the
governor of the Bank of Finland to announce his resignation.
Interest rates continued to rise when the markets opened yesterday but
gradually fell back during the day as some semblance of calm took hold.
In Sweden, the overnight rate was increased from 11 per cent to 13 per cent
to prevent further krona outflows, after Skr22bn (Pounds 2.1bn) flooded out
of the country on Friday.
Finland's one-month Helibor rate climbed to 25 per cent yesterday from its
close of 16.76 per cent on Friday, but gradually slipped back to around
18-19 per cent by the end of trading.
The Bank of Finland said that there were further outflows of currency
yesterday despite the high interest rates, but added that the outflow was
nowhere near as high as on Friday, when an estimated FM5bn-10bn left the
country.
'There was some selling pressure on the Finnmark so we intervened in the
market to maintain its level,' said Mr Markus Fogelholm, head of market
operations at the central bank, adding that the markka had closed marginally
firmer against the Ecu.
Analysts responded to the government's package of welfare cuts with some
caution. Mr Roger Kempe, an analyst at Evli Securities, one of the largest
securities houses in Finland, said: 'Overall the reaction to these measures
was good, but they are not sufficient and so we could see some further
nervousness. The government needs to cut spending this year, and by
FM20bn-25bn.' The government said its FM10bn cuts in spending would take
place in 1993.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR BORIS YELTSIN, the Russian president, yesterday narrowly defeated a
parliamentary motion of no confidence in his government.
However, his opponents demonstrated a new determination to force their
demands on to the political and economic agenda.
The first day of the Russian Congress of People's Deputies demonstrated a
groundswell among deputies against Mr Yeltsin and left Russia's economic
reform process in the balance.
During the proceedings, deputies showed determination to force a change of
economic course, even if this meant the appointment of a new government. Mr
Yeltsin defeated a direct vote of no confidence by only a slim margin, of
447 votes to 412, from a total of 1,003 deputies.
He was also forced to abandon plans for Mr Yegor Gaidar, first deputy prime
minister in charge of the economy, to deliver his report on economic reform
yesterday. Instead, Mr Yeltsin, agreed to make the report himself today.
It became clear that the pro- and anti-reform factions have organised into
two political blocs. These reflected alliances formed at the weekend to try
to instil voting discipline into previously diverse and loosely organised
factions.
The hardline bloc, Russian Unity, which brings together the patriotic and
communist groups, is pressing for the resignation of the government, an end
to radical reform and - in a number of cases - the resignation of Mr Yeltsin
as prime minister.
The pro-government bloc, including Democratic Russia and others that formed
Mr Yeltsin's main support during his presidential race, has submerged its
various criticisms of the government in favour of a 'co-operative coalition
of reform' with the president. Both groups number somwhere around 400
deputies, with the hardliners probably slightly ahead.
The position of the Industrial Union, which numbers around some 56 deputies
and represents industry's interests, is seen by the government and the
presidential apparatus as crucial. They are claimed as members by the
hardliners, but this is denied by their leaders. Instead, they are
bargaining behind the scenes with ministers for further tax breaks and
credits in return for their support.
Mr Mikhail Bocharov, a leading businessman and deputy, said: 'The
industrialists are worried about taxes and the rise in energy prices (set
for June). If they find if necessary to vote with the hardline parties, they
will make up more than half the congress. However, I think they will reach
agreement with the government.
Mr Andrei Nechayev, the economics minister, said: 'We are working closely
with the industrialists to try to find practical solutions.'
If the government succeeds in buying off trouble, it will be at the cost of
a further weakening of a reform programme. There were announcements last
week that Rbs200bn credit would be made available to agriculture and
industry, and promises by Mr Yeltsin at the weekend that he would cut taxes
and bring businessmen into the cabinet.

FT  07 APR 92 / Growing confidence raises hopes of end to recession
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN'S companies and consumers are increasingly confident, raising hopes
that the recession could be coming to an end.
Independent surveys published yesterday indicated that more than half UK
companies expect higher orders and sales in the current quarter and that
consumers increased their spending slightly in the first three months of
this year.
The government also published figures for February that provided the first
signs of increased demand for consumer credit since last August.
The latest quarterly business expectations survey from Dun &amp; Bradstreet, the
business information group, found that optimism among companies has returned
to levels last seen in the final quarter of 1989.
Although the employment outlook remains weak, it found a sharp increase in
optimism about export prospects and a marked improvement in business
confidence in London and the south-east in spite of uncertainties triggered
by the election campaign.
The Dun &amp; Bradstreet report showed all business sectors, except
construction, expect improvements in sales, orders and exports. According to
Mr Philip Mellor, the company's marketing manager, its results represented
'a strong leading indicator of an economic turnaround'.
Yesterday's quarterly survey of regional consumer sentiment from Gallup and
Business Strategies Ltd, an economic consultancy, pointed to a slow recovery
in consumer confidence and an 0.3 per cent rise in total consumer spending
in the first three months of this year compared with last year's final
quarter.
This finding gained some support from Central Statistical Office figures,
which showed net credit advanced to consumers by finance houses, building
societies and through banks' credit cards increased by Pounds 13m in
February.
City analysts, however, were reluctant to read too much into yesterday's
crop of upbeat economic indicators. The surveys from Dun &amp; Bradstreet and
Gallup and Business Strategies have yet to establish clear track records
while yesterday's news that car sales fell sharply in March also encouraged
caution.
But the indicators 'could be straws in the wind', commented Mr Peter
Spencer, UK economist of Shearson Lehman, the securities company. He noted
that yesterday's news followed other positive pointers for the economy, such
as last week's report from the Institute of Purchasing and Supply showing a
sharp rise in its purchasing managers' index last month.
The Dun &amp; Bradstreet survey, conducted between March 11 and 27, contained no
hint that the election campaign and Labour's consistent narrow lead in the
polls had a negative impact on business sentiment.

FT  07 APR 92 / Labour lead confirmed in widest opinion poll: Kinnock and
Major rule out coalition despite surge in Lib Dem support
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR NEIL KINNOCK looked set last night to emerge from Thursday's general
election as the leader of the largest party in a hung parliament after the
most comprehensive opinion poll of the campaign gave Labour a 2.5 point
lead.
The poll, which confirmed the recent surge in Liberal Democrat support at
the expense of both main parties, came as Mr John Major and Mr Kinnock
bluntly ruled out any post-election coalition with Mr Paddy Ashdown.
Mr Ashdown reaffirmed that an unequivocal commitment to electoral reform
would be the price of such a deal. But he appeared to soften his previous
threat immediately to vote down any legislative programme which did not meet
that condition.
The Conservatives' implacable opposition to proportional representation was
underlined further by Mr Kenneth Baker, the home secretary. He warned that,
alongside looser immigration controls, it could trigger an upsurge in
rightwing extremism in Britain comparable to the growth of the German
fascist movement.
The ICM poll for the Press Association, covering more than 10,000 voters
interviewed last week, puts Labour on 38.7 per cent, the Conservatives on
36.2 per cent and the Liberal Democrats on 20.4 per cent, with others on 4.7
per cent.
Translated into parliamentary seats it would give Labour 305 overall, six or
seven more than the Conservatives but 21 short of an overall majority. That
would leave the Liberal Democrats holding the balance of power.
A much smaller Harris survey for the Daily Express last night put Labour on
38 per cent, a one-point lead over the Conservatives. The Liberal Democrats
were at 21 per cent.
The ICM poll suggests, however, that the average swing of 7 per cent from
Conservative to Labour since the last general election may understate Mr
Kinnock's potential gains in some decisive marginals. It puts the swing in
West Midlands and Yorkshire and Humberside at 10.5 per cent and in the
south-east at 9 per cent. A separate ICM poll for Today newspaper of 52
marginals also suggests Labour is doing particularly well in its target
seats.
The results followed an apparent acknowledgment by Mr Major that the Tories
may lose their overall majority on Thursday. In an attempt to win back
wavering supporters from the Liberal Democrats, he said a hung parliament
would lead to unstable government.
Mr Major, who launched a further sharp attack on the opposition parties'
support for Scottish devolution and closer European integration, insisted he
remained confident of leading a majority government. But ministerial
colleagues acknowledged a more realistic ambition was to win back enough
wavering voters to emerge as the largest party.
Mr Ashdown's public insistence that the Liberal Democrats would be prepared
to support whichever of the main parties met his terms was undercut by a
senior member of his frontbench team. The colleague said it was
'inconceivable' that the Scottish Liberal Democrats, who make up half the
party's parliamentary support, would sustain in office a minority
Conservative government.
The Liberal Democrat leader appeared to soften his previous insistence that
his party would vote down any legislative programme, or Queen's Speech,
which did not include a commitment to electoral reform. He told BBC's
Election Call there might be circumstances - a sterling or international
crisis - in which he would keep his options open.
But his insistence that, in the event of a hung parliament, he would be
seeking a 'partnership government' with representation for his party at all
levels was curtly rejected by Mr Kinnock.
Asked if he could see circumstances in which Liberal Democrats would have
cabinet seats, Mr Kinnock said he could not.

FT  07 APR 92 / Voters dentcredibility of Italian coalition
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE post-war domination of Italian politics by the Christian Democrats was
broken yesterday by a protest vote ushering in a period of uncertainty.
Preliminary computer projections indicated the Christian Democrat vote had
fallen for the first time in 46 years to below 30 per cent for the first
time. The outcome is a fragmentation of support for traditional parties
after the country's first post-war election without a powerful communist
party in opposition.
Whoever controls the new administration will need to implement an austerity
programme to combat a public sector deficit close to 11 per cent of GDP, and
carry out long-awaited institutional reforms. This was the basis on which
the Christian Democrats had fought the campaign with their allies, the
Socialists, the Liberals (PLI) and the Social Democrats (PSDI).
It looked unlikely last night that this outgoing four-party coalition, which
was projected to muster no more than 48 per cent of the vote, would be able
to form a government.
Quirks in seat distribution could still give the coalition parties a
majority in the 630-seat chamber of deputies but, in the 315-seat senate,
they were projected to hold 45 per cent of the vote, or 12 seats less than
the number required for a majority. This would impede their chances of
forming a government.
Moreover, such a frag-administration would be thought incapable of tackling
a full term involving convergence with Europe as laid out by the Maastricht
treaty.
'The coalition fought the campaign saying vote for us or chaos. The voters
have preferred chaos,' said Mr Giorgio La Malfa, leader of the small
Republican party and one of the beneficiaries of the protest vote.
Mr Arnaldo Forlani, the Christian Democrat party secretary, described the
result as 'the opening of a new unwritten chapter in a book'. He claimed the
electorate had rejected the coalition's election campaign calling for a
stable government. He himself indicated he might resign, assuming full
responsibility for the party's failure to convince voters.
Equally crest-fallen was Mr Bettino Craxi, the Socialist leader, who had
counted on becoming the next premier in an ongoing four-party coalition. The
fragmentation of the vote was underlined by the fact that six parties each
won between 5 and 17 per cent of the vote.
For the chamber of deputies, the Christian Democrats were being given 29.6
per cent last night, a drop of 5 per cent, while the Socialists appeared to
have dropped by more than 1 per cent to 13.3 per cent.
The main beneficiary from the protest vote was the populist Lombard League
which appeared likely to pick up more than 9 per cent of the vote
nationwide.

FT  07 APR 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BUYING by independent traders, as they anticipated a hung parliament in this
week's election, led to a squeeze in stock index futures, sending the June
contract on the FT-SE sharply forward, writes Joel Kibazo.
The June contract kicked off two points ahead of its Friday close of 2,415,
but quickly fell back to 2,411 on early selling orders. This turned out to
be the low of the day and was only a temporary decline, before independent
traders went on a buying spree as they took positions ahead of Thursday's UK
general election, discounting the prospect of an outright winner in the
contest.
By mid-afternoon, June had reached 2,442, the high of the day, but
profit-taking thereafter caused a decline in the contract's advance.
June eventually closed at 2,429, a 28-point premium to the cash market and
around 6 points above its estimated fair value premium to cash of about 22.
Turnover at 7,033 was healthy.
The traded options market continued to witness good volumes, with 29,698
contracts traded. The FT-SE option was again busy, trading a day's total of
8,590 contracts. Among stock options, Barclays was active, with 5,786
contracts transacted.

FT  07 APR 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Frankfurt and Paris start week
on firmer note
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SENIOR BOURSES started the week on a strong note, though Italy fell after
hours as initial projections pointed to a defeat for the coalition
government, writes Our Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT was unmoved by the swing to the far right in Sunday's two state
elections. Instead, the market took heart from some encouraging economic
news and stronger bond futures. The DAX index closed at its highest level in
two weeks, rising 14.99 to 1,734.62, while the FAZ index, calculated at
midsession, gained 3.78 to 706.02. Turnover rose to DM7.1bn from DM4.5bn.
Analysts said that a forecast by the Bundesbank's chief economist, Mr Otmar
Issing, that inflation would be under 4 per cent by the end of the year
lifted sentiment, since it appeared to rule out a further rise in interest
rates. The wage settlement for bank employees of under 6 per cent was also
well received, although analysts said that there was now pressure on other
sectors to settle at that level.
Dresdner Bank, which reported better-than-expected 1991 results and forecast
moderate expansion this year, rose DM1 to DM351.50. Commerzbank advanced
DM3.70 to DM258.70 ahead of its results. After the close, the bank said that
1991 consolidated group operating profits would be up by one-third.
Among car makers BMW rose DM5.20 to DM586.20, Volkswagen added DM6.40 to
DM375.80, and Daimler-Benz was DM7.70 stronger at DM769.00. But Porsche went
against the trend closing down DM2 at DM550.
PARIS was surprisingly firm, which brokers attributed to reasonable domestic
demand and a complete absence of sellers. There was also talk that UK market
makers in French equities had been caught short. The CAC 40 index rose 32.04
or 1.7 per cent to 1,974.77 in modest turnover of FFr2.2bn.
Alcatel was the most active stock, rising FFr19 to FFr619, after its joint
venture, GEC Alsthom, said it expects more deals in China after a consortium
it led won a Pounds 550m order to build a power station in Guangdong
Province.
Other gainers included Michelin up FFr6.20 or 3.8 per cent to FFr169.80
ahead of its 1991 results. On the way down was the drinks company Remy
Cointreau which fell FFr8.50 or 4.5 per cent to FFr179.50 on rumours of a
disappointing response to its share placing.
Perrier was one of the day's least active stocks, as it remained at FFr1,700
with 33,050 shares traded. Nestle and Indosuez said that they now held 57.6
per cent of Perrier's shares and 66.8 per cent of the voting rights.
MILAN rose in quiet trading in the official session but share prices were
later marked down on London's Seaq as an exit poll showed that the ruling
four-party coalition had suffered a serious setback in the national
elections. The Comit index added 2.69 to 511.59 in turnover estimated at
less than Friday's L90bn.
In official trading, Fiat rose L8 to L4,823 while Generali eased L60 to
L29,340. But after the poll, they fell back in London to L4,770-L4,815 and
L29,000-L29,200 respectively. A market-maker in Italian equities said that
prices were being marked down in the absence of any selling pressure.
San Paolo, the newly-listed bank, continued to drop, closing L14 lower at
L12,201.
AMSTERDAM gained ground on strong interest in Royal Dutch which rose Fl 2.30
to Fl 145.10 as tension in the Gulf boosted the price of crude oil. The CBS
Tendency Index ended up 1.0 at 125.7 in turnover of Fl 534.6m.
Reports that KLM and British Airways had resumed merger talks, later denied
by the Dutch carrier, lifted its shares by Fl 1.30 to Fl 36.10.
Heineken advanced Fl 3.30 to Fl 194.50 after saying that might buy an east
European brewer.
ZURICH saw insurers coming to the forefront on speculation that they might
swap their participation certificates for shares later in the year. The SMI
index rose 13.9 to 1,843.0.
Swiss Re bearers gained SFr120 to SFr2,630 and Zurich Insurance bearers
advanced SFr50 to SFr4,220 while its registered sharers weakened SFr10 to
SFr4,040.
Roche certificates rose SFr40 to SFr3,160 following Friday's strong results.
BRUSSELS closed above the day's lows as dealers squared positions on the
last day of the forward market account. The Bel-20 index fell 3.90 to
1,184.65 in turnover of BFr700m. Delhaize closed down BFr130 or 1.4 per cent
to BFr9,200.
MADRID eased ahead of next week's inflation data and the general index fell
1.68 to 248.87 in turnover of some Pta9bn.
STOCKHOLM rebounded from its recent weakness in spite of a rise in the
marginal lending rate to 13 per cent from 11 per cent, following a large
SKr22bn outflow of foreign currency from Sweden on Friday. The Affarsvarlden
general index rose 7.7 to 988.2, in turnover of SKr533m after SKr409m.
Volvo rose on rumours that it would sell its car operations to Renault. The
B free share jumped SKr16 to SKr427.
LISBON rose following the escudo's entry into the ERM. The BTA index added
26.2 or 1.3 per cent to 2,052.5. Mr John Ferreira at Carnegie International
said foreign investors were likely to increase weightings as Portugal's
positive interest rate scenario becomes more widely appreciated.
VIENNA saw the oil group OMV fall Sch42 or 4.4 per cent to Sch923 on
concerns that the crisis over Libya could cut off a major source of crude.
The ATX 18-share index fell 17.99 or 1.8 per cent to 980.88, its lowest
close since January 27.
HELSINKI edged higher in very thin trade with attention fixed on the foreign
exchange and money markets. The HEX index rose 5.5 to 806.9 in turnover of
FM7.3m.

FT  07 APR 92 / World Stock Markets: Depressed Tokyo needs stronger medicine
By Antonia Sharpe
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
TOKYO'S depression showed no signs of lifting at the start of the second
quarter. Even the central bank's long-awaited cut in the official discount
rate could not prevent Japanese equities falling by 7.6 per cent in local
currency terms, on the FT-Actuaries World Indices.
The Nikkei is now languishing below 19,000, a five-year low, and there are
few signs of an early recovery. In its weekly report, Nomura International
says that in the worst-case scenario the Nikkei could fall to around 15,000.
But the broker expects the government to prevent this happening by further
fiscal stimulation of the economy.
Nomura adds that the prospect of a two-tier market is increasing, with the
financial sector vulnerable to further weakness, while early cyclical stocks
and good quality companies could drastically outperform the market.
The world was generally weaker, down 2.6 per cent in local currency terms.
Fears of another currency devaluation depressed Finland by 4.3 per cent.
This concern, coupled with a sharp increase in interest rates to stem a big
rise in capital outflows, pushed down neighbouring Sweden by 3.5 per cent.
Mexico continued to be volatile as it fell back 4.2 per cent on
profit-taking following the previous week's surge. The biggest corrections
were to be found in Telmex, Aspasco and Tolmex. On a more positive note,
volume in Mexican equities is expected to increase noticeably now that
trading hours have been extended by two hours.
Last week's few winners were provided by continental Europe. Italy recovered
2.8 per cent from its 1992 low as traders squared their positions ahead of
the national elections.
France gained 1.2 per cent in response to the sacking of Mrs Edith Cresson,
its first female prime minister, who was replaced by Mr Pierre Beregovoy,
who was popular in his role as finance minister.

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
LATE arbitrage-related trading pushed share prices lower at the close in
dull trading, although a firmer tone in blue chip issues helped to lift
sentiment, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei closed 123.34 down at 18,436.37. The index fell to the day's low
of 18,376.86 in the morning, but rose to the session's high of 18,670.81 in
the afternoon on bargain hunting by investment trusts and index-linked
buying.
Movements were dominated by index-linked trading led by the futures markets;
however, traders said other market indicators reflected a slight change in
sentiment. Advances led declines by 624 to 343, with 137 issues unchanged.
The Topix index of all first section stocks improved 3.96 to 1,324.61, while
in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index put on 1.27 to 1,057.88.
Volume fell to 200m shares from Friday's 350m as large institutional
investors refrained from activity. Small-lot bargain hunting of
international blue chips by foreigners was noted, as well as light trading
by dealers.
Leading electricals firmed. Hitachi gained Y14 to Y788 and Toshiba Y11 to
Y589. Nippon Telegraph and Telephone rallied Y14,000 to Y614,000.
Teac, a manufacturer of magnetic tapes, forged ahead Y100 to Y881 on hopes
of a recovery in the US semiconductor market. Dealers said some brokers were
targeting semiconductor related high-technology issues as a new market
theme. However, Mr Dan Kerrigan at County NatWest said investors would be
limited to short-term trading, since the US recovery was forecast to be
limited.
Amada, a machinery maker, firmed Y10 to Y1,080. Investors were encouraged by
hopes of a rise in sales since the company is a potential beneficiary of the
government's plan to promote corporate investment in labour-saving machines.
Oil-related shares rose on the back of firmer crude oil prices, following an
Iranian attack on a rebel base in Iraq. Teikoku Oil added Y9 at Y621 and
Arabian Oil Y140 at Y4,740.
Some speculative favourites that had been heavily sold last week by
investors who had bought on margin recovered on active bargain hunting.
Nippon Carbon rebounded Y46 to Y696 and Clarion Y35 to Y790.
Banking issues, which also declined sharply last week, lost further ground,
although dealers noted that heavy selling had subsided. Industrial Bank of
Japan dipped Y20 to Y1,640 and Fuji Bank Y30 to Y1,470.
In Osaka, the OSE average retrieved 342.84 to 19,884.85 in volume of 8.6m
shares, supported by light buying after seven consecutive days of decline.
Defensive issues such as chemicals and pharmaceuticals gained, Ono
Pharmaceutical ending Y110 up at Y4,710.
Roundup
THE Pacific Rim was mixed. Kuala Lumpur, Singapore and Bangkok were closed.
HONG KONG receded in low turnover and the Hang Seng index slipped 19.80 to
4,896.90. Turnover came to HKDollars 1.38bn, after HKDollars 2.18bn on
Friday.
Rumours that Cheung Kong might buy assets from Olympia &amp; York, the troubled
Canadian property group, depressed its shares, which shed 30 cents to
HKDollars 20.70. Hutchison Whampoa declined 20 cents to HKDollars 14.80 on
speculation that it is planning a rights issue.
SEOUL's composite index edged up 0.19 to 590.02 in turnover of Won300.51bn,
against Won251.4bn during Saturday's half-day session.
TAIWAN retreated as political tension in the National Assembly depressed
sentiment. The weighted index lost 81.86 or 1.7 per cent to 4,652.10.
Turnover was TDollars 11.8bn (TDollars 15.4bn), its lowest since October.
MANILA moved ahead as concern about violence ahead of May's presidential
election eased. The composite index rose 19.66 to 1,131.43. Turnover fell to
178.9m pesos (217.7m).
AUSTRALIA rose on optimism that there would be a cut in interest rates soon.
The All Ordinaries index gained 10.9 at 1,576.7 in ADollars 163.2m turnover.
BOMBAY lost ground on widespread profit-taking amid fears that the
government might intervene to cool the overheated market. The BSE index fell
175.68 or 4.2 per cent to 4,062.57.

FT  07 APR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: 'Buoyant' aluminium forecast
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ALUMINIUM INDUSTRY demand will soon recover and the industry will experience
a period of buoyant prices, which will enable it to deal with a large
backlog of investment that needs to be undertaken, according to the Anthony
Bird consultancy organisation in its latest market review.
Primary aluminium demand is forecast to grow at an annual 3.4 per cent
during the next ten years, fractionally less than the 3.6 per cent growth
Bird sees for world industrial production growth. Demand will increase in
bursts rather than in a steady stream.
Exports from the former communist countries, at present a hugely disturbing
factor in the market, are forecast by Bird to disappear by 1999. It
estimates that exports from the old eastern bloc reached 818,000 tonnes last
year, are likely to fall nearly one third to 567,000 tonnes in 1992, and
then fall down to 407,000 tonnes next year.
Bird points out that presently low aluminium prices have caused smelter
construction to slow sharply. When projects in the pipeline are completed,
capacity will stop growing for a time. It suggests the planned rate of
annual capacity growth to 2002 is 1.7 per cent, well below forecast demand
growth.
However, Bird believes more high-cost European smelters will close unless
they make substantial cost savings.
Bird calculates that western smelters need 69 cents per lb to cover
operating costs and this will soon rise to 77 cents. However, the London
Metal Exchange spot price is forecast to average only 57.6 cents a lb,
rising to 66.8 cents in 1993.
The report says: 'Aluminium prices must rise towards a level that will make
investment possible'. It predicts that the average price during the
1994-2002 period will be slightly more than 86 cents a lb in constant March
1992 money and at current exchange rates.

FT  07 APR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Brazil's mineral data point to
fall in output
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BILL HINCHBERGER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SAO PAULO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRELIMINARY government figures show a 2.8 per cent fall in the value of
Brazilian mineral production last year, compared with 1990.
However, mineral exports increased by 7 per cent during the year, according
to the National Department of Mineral Production (DNPM).
The overall decline, blamed partly on lower domestic demand due to the
Brazilian recession, represents only the second time in a decade that
production has fallen, said a DNPM official.
The department estimated the total value of Brazilian mining production at
roughly Dollars 10bn.
The most important reductions were in the extraction of gold, iron ore, and
tin. Among the minerals bucking the downward trend was bauxite, the ore from
which aluminium is made.
Gold output suffered primarily from a significant decrease in output from
wildcat miners, known as garimpeiros, who extracted 55,525 kg, down 23 per
cent. The reduction was explained by their high costs, which outdistanced
the international price for the metal, and the depletion of the main
garimpos (wildcat mines), Serra Pelada and Rio Madeira.
Industrial production actually increased by 12 per cent, to 33,584 kg. The
overall total of 89,109 kg was down from 101,727 kg in 1990.
Tin production fell by 25.2 per cent, to 29,300 tonnes from 39,149 tonnes.
Most of the total, 17,300 tonnes, was extracted from the Pitinga mine, run
by the state-owned firm Paranapanema.
Reduced garimpeiro production was also partly responsible for the reduced
tin output.
Iron ore registered a 1.5 per cent decline, to 149,986,000 tonnes from
152,256,900.
The state-owned Companhia Vale do Rio Doce, the world's leading exporter of
iron ore, accounts for more than half of the country's production. It
registered a 2.8 per cent drop in output.

WORLD OIL prices moved upwards yesterday following Iraq's claims that it had
shot down an Iranian warplane over Iraqi airspace at the weekend. North Sea
Brent oil for May delivery was up 30 cents at Dollars 18.85 at the close of
trading. At one time during the day it had touched Dollars 19 a barrel.
Middle East tensions have buoyed sentiment in the oil market where traders
continue to be concerned at the ongoing disagreements between Libya and the
United Nations about the 1988 Lockerbie bombing, as well as the impact of
sanctions.
Cuts in output by Saudi Arabia and, to a lesser extent, Iran, are beginning
to be felt in the market. While these have not been great, they are enough
to support the market in the short-term.
Mr Joe Stanislaw, at Cambridge Energy Research Associates, said: 'The irony
is that the United Nations probably has more influence on the oil price
right now than Opec'.
The colder-than-usual spring weather in Europe and North America has pushed
up heating oil prices which, in turn, has pulled crude oil prices in its
wake. However, while traders say that sentiment in the market has become
much firmer during the past few days, this could still be shortlived if the
current Middle East disputes are resolved soon.
Russian oil output is expected to fall to 397m tonnes in 1992, down 14 per
cent from 1991, according to a government document released on Monday,
reports Reuter from Moscow.
Daily oil output had fallen by 20,000 tonnes between November 1991 and March
1992, the document said. It was circulated at a meeting of the Russian
Congress of People's Deputies. March oil output totalled 34.7m tonnes, down
from 36.2m in November. The document said that higher prices were essential
to end the slump in output.

Indian export drive
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE INDIAN government, emboldened by the prospect of another bumper crop
during the 1991-92 season (October-September), has authorised the export of
250,000 tonnes of sugar.
Last year, India resumed exporting after a gap of six years, with sales
totalling 525,000 tonnes. Industry officials believe that, like last year,
the government will be making export releases in phases.
The Indian Sugar Mills Association and the National Federation of
Co-operative Sugar Factories have made representation to the government
that, in the interest of the sugar economy and also in order to step up
foreign exchange earning, permission should be given for a minimum export of
500,000 tonnes.
According to Mr Om Dhanuka, spokesman for ISMA, India now has the capacity
to export 1m tonnes of sugar per year, provided that the releases are made
uniformly during the year. The capacity of Indian ports to handle sugar is
limited and during the monsoon the ports of Bombay, Nav Sheva and Goa cannot
handle sugar at all.
India has found a good market for sugar in Bangladesh and in Sri Lanka. It
has also been able to find buyers in some West Asian and European countries.
At current world prices, the loss on export is estimated at Rs100 (Pounds
2.20) a tonne. That is to be equitably shared by all sugar mills in the
country.
In the first five months until February, India had produced 7.86m tonnes of
sugar, compared with 7.23m tonnes in the corresponding period of the
previous season. In the current season, 375 sugar factories are in
operation, up from 359 last year.
In response to the package of incentives for the creation of extra capacity,
some new sugar factories have been commissioned this year. According to Mr
Dhanuka, India hopes to produce 12.5m tonnes of sugar this season, compared
with 12m tonnes last year. Domestic consumption is forecast to be about
11.5m tonnes, up 800,000 tonnes.
The present season opened with stocks of 3.33m tonnes, against 2.22m tonnes
last year. The opening stock has to take care of internal requirements of
the first three months when production is low. In the circumstances, India
could easily export up to 1m tonnes.

BASE METALS prices closed lower across the board yesterday. But trading was
described as 'routine' and the falls were generally marginal. The exception
was the tin market, which saw a continued reversal of the cash premium
established in the middle of last week in response to near term supply
worries. The cash position closed at Dollars 5,730 a tonne, down Dollars 30
from Friday, and its discount against three months metal widened to Dollars
7.50. Five days earlier it had held a Dollars 30 premium. The cash COPPER
price closed at Pounds 1,285 a tonne, down Pounds 4.50 on the day, after
being lifted early in the day by concern about the situation in Peru after
President Fujimori's dissolution of the congress. Peru is an important
exporter of copper, as well as ZINC, which was also boosted early on, only
to slip back with the other metals. The cash price closed at Dollars 1,268 a
tonne, down Dollars 5 on balance. At the London bullion market GOLD and
PLATINUM prices drifted lower but SILVER was buoyed by the Peruvian news.
Dealers said the platinum market was belatedly responding to a forecast of
increased Russian shipments.

FT  07 APR 92 / International Company News: Spectre of state interference
haunts Israel's banking sector - Gedalia Gal steered legislation through the
Knesset enforcing an automatic write-off of 20 per cent of collective farm
debts. This made him public enemy number one to the banks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
It came as no surprise to anyone in Israel when Mr Gedalia Gal, a
little-known MP for the opposition Labour party, was voted the top choice as
a parliamentary candidate in the coming general election by
Labour-affiliated members of Moshavim collective farms.
However, to the banks which are owed about Shk2bn (Dollars 828m) by the
chronically-indebted Moshavim, Mr Gal is public enemy number one.
Mr Gal steered legislation through the Knesset early last month enforcing an
automatic write-off of 20 per cent of Moshavim debts. These totalled
hundreds of millions of shekels which had gone down the banks' bad debt plug
hole over the past five years.
Under the 'Gal Law', which also covers 21 Kibbutzim, the collectivist
cousins of the Moshavim, and even the private sheep farm of Mr Ariel Sharon,
the housing minister, many of the 500 Moshavim will be eligible for much
more than a 20 per cent debt write-off.
The Bank of Israel quickly instructed the country's five main banks to take
in the effect of the new legislation in their 1991 accounts. The initial
warning from the central bank that net profits would be all but wiped out
proved to be over pessimistic, partly because underlying performance was in
most cases an improvement on 1990. But the Gal Law effect was painful.
Bank Leumi, the second largest bank by asset value, was pushed into the red,
losing Shk78m. Gal provisions of Shk301m were much to blame.
The others remained in profit: the smallest of the five, First International
Bank of Israel (Fibi), and Israeli Discount Bank (IDB), third in size, are
not much exposed in the agricultural sector and ahead of 1990, by 48 per
cent and 24 per cent respectively.
United Mizrahi Bank raised net profit by more than three times to Shk32.7m.
But this came after a poor 1990, and it would have made more without the
Shk98m set aside for the agricultural sector, Shk57m directly attributable
to the Gal Law.
Bank Hapoalim, the biggest group, saw its net profit slip by 26 per cent
over 1990 to Shk135.7m after farm sector provisions of almost Shk0.5bn.
Overall, Fibi led the field in profitability with net return on capital of
8.4 per cent. At Mizrahi, the figure was 5 per cent, while IDB and Hapoalim
managed 4.7 per cent and 4.4 per cent respectively.
The banks insist that the loans set aside because of the Gal Law were
performing debts. They complained that the law does not discriminate between
genuine distress and those farms which are capable of meeting their dues.
But there is an argument that in the long term, taking a big hit now has
merit if it means the banks put behind them the problem of agricultural
debt, which has plagued them since the late 1980s.
Nonetheless, the Gal Law is an ominous development and its timing is
particularly bad for the banking sector. This is the year that the
government is finally supposed to begin selling off its majority
shareholdings that it has held in all but Fibi since it rescued the system
from disaster following a share price collapse in 1983.
A preferential share structure left control in the hands of the original
owners. But this will change when the government holdings are sold. The
government is hoping that the sale process will inject a greater element of
competition and attract foreign investment and foreign managerial skills
into the local banking scene.
There is a clear concern that the spectre of political interference could
put off potential bidders. 'The implication (of the Gal Law) is that
suddenly the legislature may intervene in the business relationship between
two third parties,' admits Mr Gil Leidner, head of the government agency
responsible for the bank sale process.
He says the law has underscored the need for the government to get out of
its albeit arms-length involvement in banking. 'The sooner the government
sells its holdings the better. If the banks were not owned by the state, I
don't believe this legislation would have happened,' he says.
Bids close at the end of this month for a majority stake in Mizrahi,
controlled by the World Mizrahi religious organisation. A similar process is
under way for Bank Igud, a subsidiary of Bank Leumi, and the same is planned
for IDB. A public flotation of stakes in Bank Leumi and Bank Hapoalim is
planned as a step towards disposal.
The process is an important element in the government's bid to reform the
economy and persuade foreigners to invest in and lend to Israel to help it
absorb mass immigration from the former Soviet Union.

FT  07 APR 92 / International Company News: Coconut tycoon fights to retake
Philippine group - Jose Galang unravels the webb of disputes about company
ownership and voting rights that mark the comeback to the Manila corporate
scene of Eduardo Cojuangco
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOSE GALANG
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
One of the most remarkable comebacks on the Philippine corporate scene is
about to be brought off by Mr Eduardo 'Danding' Cojuangco, the coconut
tycoon.
Mr Cojuangco is in the final stages of retaking control of the United
Coconut Planters Bank, which he helped set up in 1975 but was sequestered by
the government in 1986 shortly after the fall of his patron, President
Ferdinand Marcos.
Mr Cojuangco's return to the Planters Bank should also open the door for his
retaking of San Miguel, the country's largest industrial enterprise in which
the Planters Bank holds a large block of shares that had been sequestered.
Sequestration of both companies' shares was based on suspicion that they
were acquired illegally by Mr Marcos, his relatives and business associates
 -of whom the best known is Mr Cojuangco.
Mrs Corazon Aquino, after assuming the presidency, set up a presidential
commission on good government to track down and retrieve what she called the
ill-gotten wealth.
For Mr Cojuangco, regaining control of the Planters Bank and San Miguel will
not only complete a task launched on his return to Manila in November 1989
from exile in the US, it could bolster his position in the Philippines' May
election.
Mr Cojuangco is one of eight candidates aiming to succeed his estranged
cousin, Mrs Aquino, who is not seeking a second term as president.
On a larger perspective, the musical chairs at the Planters Bank and San
Miguel is an indictment of a system that induces businessmen to nurture
political connections, even develop political acumen, to be able to stay the
course.
However, it remains unclear how Mr Cojuangco's regaining power at these
companies will figure in his agenda if he wins the presidential election.
Under the Philippine constitution, the president is not allowed to
participate in any business.
Mr Cojuangco's return to the Planters Bank, the country's sixth largest
commercial bank in terms of assets, was paved by a Philippine Supreme Court
ruling on March 4 upholding the coconut farmers' right to exercise the votes
on their sequestered shares.
At the time of the government's sequestration of nearly 95 per cent of the
bank's outstanding shares in June 1986, Mr Cojuangco held 17.7 per cent.
Another bloc representing 59.8 per cent was supposedly owned by 1.4m coconut
farmers, although Mr Cojuangco and his associates of big landowners at the
Philippine Coconut Producers Federation held proxies to these. Three
Cojuangco appointees in the Planters Bank, all holding important positions
in the bank, held 5 per cent each.
The commission sequestered the Planters Bank on the argument that proceeds
from a Marcos-era levy on coconuts had been used to set up the bank, so it
should be run by the state. Total collections from the levy from 1973 to
1982 were estimated at 9.7bn pesos (Dollars 400m).
The complex ownership layers in the levy-financed investments raised
suspicions that Mr Marcos might have had shareholdings. The investments were
made through various shell companies financed by a Coconut Industry
Investment Fund, according to the commission investigators.
One of Mr Cojuangco's appointees, Mr Danilo Ursua, the Planters Bank
president at the time of the sequestration, admitted to the commission that
he had endorsed to Mr Cojuangco all his shares in the bank in exchange for a
guarantee to a loan to pay for his shares.
Among items recovered at the presidential residence after Mr Marcos fled the
country in 1986, were documents endorsing more than 16.2m shares in San
Miguel. At today's prices, these are worth 972m pesos.
The supreme court ruling on the Planters Bank excluded nominees of the
commission who had been running the bank since 1986.
It said the commission, as guardian of the bank's shares 'cannot exercise
acts of strict ownership', including the right to vote. It directed that the
Philippine anti-corruption court, before which the suits against Mr
Cojuangco were filed by the government, conduct elections to the Planters
Bank board using the court's guidelines.
To prevent Mr Cojuangco and his group from 'dissipating' the bank's assets,
the Supreme Court entitled the commission to appoint a comptroller and to
review disbursements of more than 5m pesos.
However, the presidential commission-installed board has no intention of
letting go easily. Even as the commission's argument that the coconut levy
investments should be managed by the state was still being pursued in the
courts, the incumbent board postponed this year's annual shareholders'
meeting, which should have been held on March 3.
Mr Cojuangco's lawyers had petitioned the anti-corruption court to require
the Planters Bank immediately to call board elections as ordered by the
Supreme Court. The anti-corruption court is expected to rule on the petition
in the next few days.
At San Miguel, executives are edgy over the impending return of Mr
Cojuangco. Many of them remember the company's unpleasant transformation,
when Mr Cojuangco was chairman in the mid-1980s, from an apolitical
enterprise, which had previously helped it survive the many political
changes since it was set up as a small brewery in March 1890.
Political intrigue and coconut levy money played a big role in Mr
Cojuangco's entry into San Miguel. A bitter dispute in 1983 between the
younger Mr Andres Soriano, then chairman, and his cousin Mr Enrique Zobel,
one-time vice-chairman and head of Ayala Corporation, a property-based
conglomerate with holdings in San Miguel, provided an entry for Mr
Cojuangco.
Mr Cojuangco's purchases of Mr Zobel's holdings were financed by the the
Planters Bank. He declared that all his shares in San Miguel had been
mortgaged to the bank. When Mr Soriano died in 1984, Mr Cojuangco assumed
chairmanship and Mr Soriano's son, Andres, then only 33 years old, became
president.
After Mr Cojuangco fled the country with Mr Marcos during the 1986
rebellion, the young Mr Soriano moved to regain control of the corporation.
But the principal element of his manoeuvre, the sale of the Planters Bank's
30 per cent holding to a Hong Kong-based subsidiary of San Miguel, Neptunia
Corporation, aroused the suspicion of the commission.
Fearing the transaction could benefit Mr Cojuangco or Mr Marcos, the
commission sequestered the shares. Since then, the presidential commission
nominees have been voting these shares, along with another bloc owned by Mr
Cojuangco and two of his relatives. The supreme court last year ruled that
Mr Cojuangco could vote this bloc, which enabled his group to regain three
seats in the 15-member board last October.
Now the Soriano family controls no more than 3 per cent of San Miguel's
capital. If Mr Cojuangco's group gains the right to vote the Planters Bank
holdings by April 21, the date of the next San Miguel annual meeting, the
Soriano family is certain to be voted out.

FT  07 APR 92 / International Company News: La Cinq puts MMB in the red
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MMB, the French holding company that controls the Matra electronics group
and the Hachette media empire, will go into the red in 1991 because of the
losses incurred by La Cinq, the French television station managed by
Hachette which went out of business last Friday.
Last Friday the Paris commercial court decided to wind up La Cinq following
weeks of fruitless attempts to find a rescuer for the station. Earlier last
week Hachette which, like Matra, is chaired by Mr Jean-Luc Lagardere,
announced that it had been forced to restructure its finances following an
overall loss of up to FFr3.5bn (Dollars 637m) on its 18-month investment in
La Cinq.
Hachette is not only one of the largest shareholders in La Cinq, with a 25
per cent stake, but may also have to compensate the financial partners that
it introduced to the station.
Yesterday MMB disclosed that La Cinq's losses meant it would produce a
negative result for 1991. Neither Hachette nor Matra have yet published
their 1991 results. Hachette fell into losses during the first half of the
year because of La Cinq's problems and Matra suffered a steep fall in
profits due to weak demand from its key customers in the defence and
telecoms sectors.
Earlier this year Mr Lagardere surprised the Paris stock market by
announcing plans to merge Hachette and Matra. He described their combined
operations as a 'two headed eagle' claiming that so far they had been unable
to derive any benefit from their common ownership under MMB.
The details of the merger - which would create a group with FFr54.3bn in
sales and FFr1.1bn of net profits according to their 1990 accounts - have
yet to be announced. However, last week Hachette said that it planned to
press ahead with plans to combine its operations with those of Matra,
notwithstanding its own financial restructuring.

COMPAGNIE Generale des Eaux, the largest of France's two water distribution
companies, yesterday estimated that profits rose 17 per cent last year,
slightly better than most analysts were expecting.
The group said it expected net profits to rise to around FFr2.6bn (Dollars
460m) from FFr2.22bn in 1990, on turnover up by just over 15 per cent to
about FFr135bn. Cash flow was unchanged at FFr9bn.
Of total sales, FFr36.5bn were made abroad. Within that, FFr25bn was in
Europe, up from FFr18.7bn in the previous year, said the group. The rise in
European turnover came mainly from growth in the group's German construction
activities and in its British urban cleaning business.

BEGHIN-SAY, the French sugar company controlled by Italy's Ferruzzi group,
yesterday announced a fall in net profits for a second year in succession to
FFr754m (Dollars 134.64m) in 1991 from FFr1.08bn in 1990.
The group, which is to be merged by Ferruzzi with Eridiana, its Italian
sugar subsidiary, attributed the fall in net profits to a reduction in
exceptional items from a credit of FFr461m in 1990 to a debit of FFr144m
last year.
Beghin-Say, which was burdened by heavy debts after its 1988 acquisition of
Lesieur, the French cooking oils company, and large investments in
developing its sugar, oil, corn starch and ethanol interests, saw sales rise
by 8.6 per cent to FFr40.91bn during the year from FFr37.67bn.
It mustered a 22.4 per cent increase in pre-tax operating profits to
FFr1.82bn from FFr1.48bn and a 26.7 per cent rise in net profits before
exceptional items to FFr783m from FFr618m. The group's net debt rose to
FFr9.1bn in 1991 from FFr8.47bn in 1990. The board proposed raising the
dividend to FFr30 from FFr27.50.
Beghin-Say said its oils interest had shown 'strong growth' during the year
and that its grinding and refining activities had shown a moderate
improvement.
The merger with Eridania, which caused some controversy because of the
valuation of the Eridania assets being bought by Beghin-Say, will create
Europe's third largest food group, according to Ferruzzi, with projected
sales of over L11,000bn (Dollars 8.59bn) for this year.
Under the terms of the merger, Beghin-Say will make an exclusive rights
issue on Eridania's behalf in return for the latter's Italian sugar
interests and its 30 per cent stake in Cerestar, the starch group, the rest
of which is already owned by Beghin-Say. After the merger the combined
companies will be rechristened Eridania/Beghin-Say (EBS).

FT  07 APR 92 / International Company News: Commerzbank to raise capital
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
COMMERZBANK, Germany's third largest bank, is planning to hold two large
capital raising issues later this year or early next year.
According to a bank spokesman last night, the bank is likely to be launching
an issue of options and profit-participating certificates within the next
few months.
Later this year the bank is likely to issue a minimum of 2m new shares.
Assuming a share price of DM200 per share - compared with a closing price of
DM258 yesterday - the bank would raise DM400m (Dollars 242.4m) from the
issue.
The bank said it will be seeking permission from its shareholders to issue
up to 8m new ordinary shares together with convertibles and options with a
total market value of DM1.5bn. Details are likely to emerge at today's
annual press conference.
This would make it possible for the bank to raise over DM3bn, but it is
extremely unlikely it would raise this at once. It is usual for German
companies to obtain shareholder approval for issues which are then made use
of over a period of years.
The bank said last night it wanted the facility in place to increase
management flexibility in the years ahead. A full equity issue was
'probable' before the end of the current year, although the precise amount
to be raised would depend on business developments and the government's
capital adequacy plans.
The spokesman said that an issue of DM100m of nominal shares was the minimum
to be expected. If Bonn decided that Tier one capital should stand at 5 per
cent of total assets, rather than 4 per cent as required under European
Commission legislation, Commerzbank would be obliged to raise more than
this.
The bank said yesterday that total operating profits for the group rose by a
third last year. The increase in operating profits - which include the
results from own-account trading - compares with the 23 per cent increase
announced yesterday by Dresdner Bank and the 16.5 per cent increase posted
by Deutsche Bank last week.
Commerzbank did not disclose what operating profits were last year, although
further details are likely to emerge at today's results press conference.
They amounted to DM1.6bn for the first ten months of 1991 but were not
disclosed in 1990.
The bank said yesterday that the profits had been used to build up its
internal reserves.

FT  07 APR 92 / UK Company News: Sage - the getting of wisdom in the US -
Alan Cane on the risks and rewards behind the DacEasy purchase
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEATLY BOXED and sharply priced software from DacEasy, a Dallas-based
pioneer in low-cost accounting packages, is once again jostling for
attention on the well-stocked shelves of US computer superstores.
But the company's most distinctive feature is invisible to the thronging
customers. DacEasy, a quintessentially entrepreneurial US company, is owned
by a UK software house, the Sage Group of Newcastle, which bought it at the
beginning of last year for an initial Dollars 18m (Pounds 10.4m).
The sale was prompted by the insolvency of Insilco, DacEasy's former parent,
an embarrassment compounded by software development delays at DacEasy which
forced it to take its most important product off the market for some months.
Now that the US company is up and running again, some questions remain, for
Sage has to decide whether DacEasy was a good buy and whether it can make a
success of managing it.
The history of British software and computing services in the US leaves few
reasons for optimism over the latter question. While US-packaged software
suppliers, such as Microsoft, Lotus and Borland, dominate the European
market, the US has proved a graveyard for UK computing services companies.
Logica's recent results, for example, have been depressed by losses at Data
Architects, its US acquisition. An exception is Micro Focus, which offers
software aids to writing programs in Cobol, the computer language, which
dominate its sector of the US market.
Sage and DacEasy are strikingly similar. Both claim to be pioneers in
cutting the price of personal computer accounting software for small
businesses. Sterling, Sage's principal product, was launched at Pounds 375
in the early 1980s when its main competition was selling for more than
Pounds 1,000.
DacEasy's Accounting was launched in 1985 at about Dollars 50. At the time,
conventional minicomputer accounting suites from companies such as
Peachtree, DacEasy's chief competitor, sold for Dollars 5,000.
Sage and DacEasy both convert one-time software sales into recurrent
revenues by a combination of regular software upgrades and sales of computer
stationery. They charge separately for support and are both marketing,
rather than technology, led.
Sage used to spend up to 40 per cent of its budget on advertising; now it
spends 12 per cent, three times its research and development bill.
Established in 1980, Sage went public in 1989 and has a solid record of
growth in sales and profits.
Last year its revenues were boosted more than 50 per cent by the DacEasy
acquisition to reach Pounds 20m, with pre-tax profits of Pounds 6.6m, up
from Pounds 4.7m. This was against a background of a decline of up to a
third in the market for packaged accounting software.
This year, analysts are suggesting pre-tax profits of Pounds 8.3m. Since
1986, the company's operating margin has never dropped below 29 per cent.
Its Sterling package has 74 per cent of the UK market for integrated
accounting packages. Including Sovereign, a more sophisticated modular
package, it has a 43 per cent share of the overall small business accounting
market.
Sage's UK profitability has not been repeated overseas, however. MainLan,
its US company, established to exploit low-cost networking systems for small
businesses, contributes some 7.6 per cent to group sales but lost Pounds
357,000 last year through a tough trading environment and a disadvantageous
exchange rate.
The purchase of DacEasy was, for Sage, pure opportunism. Established in
1983, the US company recorded software sales of Dollars 3.7m in its first
year, mostly due to low pricing. It was sold in 1987 for Dollars 18m
together with a sales royalty arrangement to Insilco, a large US
conglomerate which was itself the subject of a leveraged buy-out in 1988.
By 1990, burdened with debt, Insilco filed for bankruptcy and put DacEasy up
for sale.
There were a number of suitors, including Sage and a management group lead
by Mr Kevin Howe, the chief executive, a former Insilco executive. Insilco
wanted its Dollars 18m back and was prepared to give Mr Howe latitude about
where DacEasy should be placed. Careful of the debt implications of a
leveraged buy-out, he settled for Sage.
Both Mr Howe and Mr David Goldman, Sage's chairman, think DacEasy was a
bargain. The total price Sage will pay, inclusive of the final stages of the
royalty arrangement, will be Dollars 24m. It is a large sum for a company,
with pre-DacEasy revenues of only Pounds 13.4m. Some Pounds 6m was accrued
from a rights issue, Pounds 3.5m from the group's own cash resources and the
rest will be paid out of operating income. Until the end of the royalty
agreement this year, DacEasy is essentially cash neutral.
Mr Howe believes that without the uncertainty caused by Insilco's insolvency
and the software delays, the company would be turning over Dollars 100m a
year rather than the Dollars 17m recorded in 1991.
By dollar value it has about 35 per cent of the US market for the simplest
level of professional accounting software, roughly the same as Peachtree.
There seems to be powerful synergies with Sage. The two companies are
working to develop a US version of Sage's Sovereign accounting system to be
called Flagship. DacEasy's distribution expertise, moreover, could give a
boost to MainLan.
Sage would seem to have bought a company with considerable recovery
potential. Indeed, DacEasy has the potential to become larger than its
parent. Some 800,000 small businesses, each with a need for an accounting
system, were started in the US in 1990.

FT  07 APR 92 / UK Company News: Chelsea offers Cabra up to Pounds 13m for
Bridge owner
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CHELSEA Football Club has not given up its fight to stay at Stamford Bridge,
even though the deadline for paying Pounds 22.85m to buy the west London
ground is only two days away.
It is understood that negotiations have been going on which could involve
Chelsea offering Cabra Estates, the heavily-indebted property company, up to
Pounds 13m for the subsidiary that owns Stamford Bridge.
Cabra has an 83.5 per cent stake in SB Property, which owns the near 12-acre
ground. If SB's net assets are Pounds 30m, that stake would be worth about
Pounds 25m.
Chelsea's argument would run that amounts should be deducted from that
Pounds 25m for a loan from SB to Cabra and for the stake that SB has in
Vincenza, owner of Fulham FC's ground at Craven Cottage.
The amount left for Chelsea to hand over in cash to Cabra could be Pounds
10m to Pounds 13m, although no information is forthcoming on where that
money might come from.
It has been described by Chelsea's connections as 'an elegant solution'. It
would reduce Cabra's debts of about Pounds 52m, clear the way for Fulham FC
to move to Stamford Bridge and end outstanding litigation.
But Mr John Duggan, chairman of Cabra, said yesterday it had received no
offer. The two merchant banks - NM Rothschild for Cabra and MacArthur for
Chelsea - had been in touch, but no direct negotiations were taking place.
Mr Duggan, who returns today from a skiing holiday in Colorado, insisted
that Stamford Bridge would be worth more than Pounds 22.85m with vacant
possession.
That figure, demanded of Chelsea, arises from a contract that has been
confirmed by the High Court and the Court of Appeal.
The issue is complicated by the recent purchase of a 29.6 per cent stake in
Cabra by Mr Ken Bates, Chelsea's chairman.
His Pounds 3m investment, through a company called Vanbrugh, has enabled him
to call for an extraordinary general meeting, which would be held by
mid-May.
One of the EGM proposals is to oust Mr Duggan as chairman and Mr Andrew
Mackay, the Conservative MP for East Berkshire, as a non-executive director.

FT  07 APR 92 / UK Company News: Crest Homes bullish about house sales
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
There was some good news for the property market yesterday with the
announcement from Crest Homes, the housebuilding arm of Crest Nicholson,
that house sales were showing a 10 per cent improvement on the previous
year.
The increase was offset by the news that house prices were depressed on last
year, although Mr Nigel Davies, marketing director, said they had stabilised
since the beginning of 1992.
Mr John Calcutt, chairman, said at the announcement of the group's results
in February that Crest had cut house prices last year to increase sales.
Mr Davies said the group had sold 200 homes, which could not be occupied
until June. This was higher than the level of the previous year, he said.
Crest, which operates in the south Midlands, the south-west and the south,
said sales were higher in all regions. The bulk of homes were sold at the
bottom to middle price range, between Pounds 55,000 and Pounds 75,000.
The company said it expected to complete about 1,500 new homes this year.

FT  07 APR 92 / UK Company News: Psion veers sharply to losses of Pounds
2.2m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PSION, the maker of hand-held computers, last year lost Pounds 2.2m before
tax compared with a profit of Pounds 546,000 in 1990. Sales fell 32 per
cent, from Pounds 31.4m to Pounds 21.3m.
Analysts had been predicting losses of between Pounds 100,000 and Pounds 1m,
but they believed the company was now through the worst and its shares were
marked up 19p to 135p on the news.
The company was hit by a combination of the recession, which depressed
demand in corporate markets, and a turn of the product cycle so new products
to replace its ageing Organiser electronic notebook did not come on stream
until the end of the year.
The figures took account of Pounds 770,000 exceptional provisions; Pounds
270,000 as the result of a product-for-media-space barter with Mediators of
the US which has since moved into Chapter 11 of the US bankruptcy code, and
Pounds 500,000 against slow moving inventory, chiefly Psion's unsuccessful
laptop computer line.
Net borrowings totalled Pounds 1.6m, giving gearing of 28 per cent. Losses
per share were 8.13p (earnings of 1.19p). A recommended final dividend of
1.4p maintains the total at 2.4p.
Mr David Potter, founder and chairman, said sales of new products had taken
off since the beginning of the current year, and the company was now trading
profitably and at record levels.
Production and shipments of the Series 3 pocket computer had increased from
4,000 units in January this year to 14,000 in March.
Mr Potter pointed out that the company adopted conservative accounting
policies, writing off development costs as incurred which did not flatter
the balance sheet. Over four years, some Pounds 5.2m has been invested in
computer families.
COMMENT
Problems at the datacommunications subsidiary, an earlier source of profits
decline, seem to have been solved. The company now has three product
families, all based on the same technology - the original Organiser, still
finding corporate uses as a data capture device, the Series 3 pocket
computer, and the HC hand held computer. Later this year, a version of the
HC featuring radio communications will be launched in the US and the UK.
There seems to be powerful demand for portable computers of this kind which
is encouraging the City to take a positive view of the company's recovery.
Costs have been cut and new and advanced production facilities established.
Analysts are looking for pre-tax profits of Pounds 3.5m this year, giving
earnings per share of 10.6p and a prospective p/e of 12.3. Psion's strength
remains the quality of its management and its products, and it should fulfil
expectations.

FT  07 APR 92 / UK Company News: Cooper Clarke back in the black
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
In the eight months to December 31 - its new financial year-end - Cooper
Clarke Group made pre-tax profits of Pounds 126,000 on sales of Pounds
13.2m.
For the previous full year there were losses of Pounds 274,000 from sales of
Pounds 20.8m.
Interest payable came to Pounds 90,000 (Pounds 299,000). Earnings per share
were 0.8p (losses 2.01p). There is no dividend.
The group, which supplies building materials, suffered from the recession
particularly in the construction industry.
Assets disposals, together with the rights issue, helped cut gearing to 20
per cent. The bad debt charge was held at 1.4 per cent of turnover even with
the large single debt from Turriff Construction of Pounds 120,000.
Mr Nicholas Jeffrey, chairman, is to leave the board after the annual
meeting.

FT  07 APR 92 / UK Company News: Laura Ashley recovery under way - Profits
of Pounds 2.7m before substantial exceptional charges
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LAURA ASHLEY, the international retail group which has suffered losses since
late 1989, yesterday claimed to be on the road to recovery with a Pounds
9.4m turnround to profits of Pounds 2.7m before tax and exceptional items in
the year to January 25.
Mr Jim Maxmin, the chief executive who joined the group last July, said he
was 'very pleased with the results' which were indicative of the progress
management was making. The shares were unchanged at 93p.
Mr Andrew Higginson, finance director, said that after two 'traumatic years'
the group was now demonstrating a number of positive trends, although it was
too early to talk of a 'total fix'.
Borrowings had fallen from a peak of Pounds 103m in March 1990 to Pounds
4.4m at the year end, helped by the Pounds 45m injection from the Japanese
Aeon group.
He said that Laura Ashley had instituted a policy of managing for margin not
sales. Gross margins had risen, especially in the second half, he said, as
the group cut production costs and refused to chase sales by cutting prices.
Overheads had been reduced.
At the operating profit level the group made Pounds 750,000 in the second
half compared to Pounds 383,000 in the first half and a Pounds 3.1m loss in
the second half of 1990-91.
Mr Higginson said that current trading showed a continuation of trends with
the US still a problem, UK sales flat but gross margins up again, and
European sales up 13 per cent with profits ahead 14 per cent.
Sales fell to Pounds 260.7m against Pounds 327.5m or a pro forma Pounds
289.2m if disposals and the change of the Revman subsidiary to an associate
are excluded. Operating expenses were down to Pounds 140m (Pounds 160.4m or
Pounds 148.9m) and operating profits were Pounds 1.1m (Pounds 5.3m or Pounds
2.7m).
Associates and royalties contributed Pounds 3.9m (Pounds 400,000 or Pounds
2m pro forma) giving pre-interest profit of Pounds 5m (Pounds 5.7m or Pounds
4.7m). Interest charges fell Pounds 10.1m to Pounds 2.3m.
However, there were exceptional items of Pounds 11.8m (Pounds 4.8m) leaving
a Pounds 9.1m (Pounds 11.5m) loss before tax. Exceptionals covered Pounds
3.4m costs involved in setting up a new distribution agreement with Federal
Express, a Pounds 1.1m rationalisation in the North American head office,
Pounds 4.7m of other restructuring costs and Pounds 2.6m of stock
write-downs. Mr Maxmin said there would be no exceptional items in the
current year.
Mr Higginson said that careful tax planning had meant negligible tax was
payable and the tax charge would be well below UK corporation tax rates for
a couple of years.
Losses per share were 3.9p (4.4p) and a 0.1p token dividend is paid to
retain trustee status; the Ashley family and directors would waive their
dividends.
COMMENT
It is hard to believe now that Laura Ashley made a pre-tax profit of Pounds
23.1m in its peak year, 1987-88. It will be some time before that level is
seen again. Mr Maxmin appears to be doing all the right things, and there
are some easy initial targets. A Pounds 9m cut in overheads in a year and a
fall in stocks from Pounds 105m to Pounds 57m in two years with another
Pounds 25m to come is an indication of just how fat and inefficient the
group had become. But once those things are sorted out one must wonder how
much money can be made from an international brand which may be strong but
is definitely niche. Meanwhile, on current year forecasts of Pounds 7.5m to
Pounds 8m pre-tax the shares look ludicrously overpriced on a prospective
p/e of about 35 on a sub-normal tax charge. But with Aeon holding 15 per
cent the downside is limited.

<TEXT>
BAA yesterday moved a step further towards divesting itself of its hotel
interests when it granted Forte a 50-year lease to manage its Gatwick
Sterling hotel.
The British airports group has already sold hotels in Gent and Amsterdam and
wants to award management contracts over its two remaining hotels - the
Heathrow Sterling and the Harlequin at Stansted.
BAA said the 474-room Gatwick hotel, linked to the airport's north terminal,
will be known as the Forte Crest, Gatwick. Its 134 staff will continue to be
employed by Forte.
Forte is not thought to be interested in taking over the remaining two
hotels.

FT  07 APR 92 / UK Company News: Aviva swings sharply to losses of Dollars
8.72m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Aviva Petroleum, the Texas-based but London-quoted oil and gas company,
swung sharply from profits of Dollars 739,061 to pre-tax losses of Dollars
8.72m (Pounds 5.06m) in the year to December 31.
In January the company appointed as deputy chairman Mr Graham Ferguson
Lacey, the evangelical preacher who heads Gulf Resources Chemical
Corporation, the group that recently bought Land's End and John O'Groats.
The losses were blamed on the Florida dry hole, revenues down to Dollars
9.32m (Dollars 12.3m) and substantially lower gas prices.
Operating losses totalled Dollars 6.91m (Dollars 2.68m) after dry holes and
abandonments took more at Dollars 2.99m (Dollars 165,336).
Below that, interest took Dollars 557,760 (gain Dollars 3.21m) and the
foreign exchange deficit was Dollars 149,892 (credit Dollars 2.1m).
Losses per share grew to 1.67 cents (earnings 0.1 cents).
The Canadian debt has been paid off and current debt amounts to Dollars
3.9m, down from Dollars 24.8m at the 1990 year-end.
In February, Aviva shareholders approved a 1-for-50 consolidation in order
to gain a Nasdaq listing in the US.

consolidation
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Quarto Group reported pre-tax profits slightly higher at Pounds 4.09m,
against Pounds 4.06m, for 1991. Mr Laurence Orbach, chairman, said it had
been a year of consolidation in difficult economic conditions.
Turnover for this US-registered publishing, marketing support and production
services group fell from Pounds 39m to Pounds 35m reflecting the closure of
the magazine division in 1990. Mr Orbach said the move had led to improved
operating margins.
Earnings per share came out at 18p (17.9p) from which the board is proposing
to increase the final dividend to 3.6375p for a total of 5.25p (4.875p).

FT  07 APR 92 / UK Company News: Severfield-Reeve dives to Pounds 0.53m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
SEVERFIELD-REEVE, the USM-quoted structural steelwork group, reported a
sharp decline in annual profits as the recession placed further pressure on
tender prices. The final dividend is omitted.
Nevertheless, Mr John Reeve, chairman, described the pre-tax outcome for
1991 - Pounds 530,000 compared with Pounds 1.86m - as a 'significant
achievement when measured against the performance of the sector.'
The result would have been better, he said, but for a bad debt charge of
Pounds 200,000 which was taken above the line. 'We maintain a cautious
approach when tendering for contracts and this has enabled us to avoid any
bad debts in the current year.'
Gearing at the year-end rose to 51 per cent, up six percentage points from
the half-year statement. Interest payments of Pounds 371,000 (Pounds
412,000) were covered 3 times by operating profits of Pounds 1.1m. Both were
adversely affected by the exceptional charge, Mr Reeve stressed.
He also attacked current pricing levels: 'The sector cannot sustain the
present idiotic level of pricing which has come about by panic tendering.'
He expected a further reduction in overall capacity to correct over supply.
Turnover dipped some 20 per cent to Pounds 16.9m and margins at the
operating level slumped from 11.5 per cent to 6.5 per cent.
After tax and Pounds 12,000 minorities, earnings emerged at 4.2p (11.9p) per
share. The final dividend is passed, leaving just the interim of 1p for the
year (3p).

FT  07 APR 92 / UK Company News: Stepping in where others fear to tread -
David Barchard considers National Australia's growth in the UK
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BARCHARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FIVE YEARS ago, while the large French and German banks were hesitantly
eyeing the UK retail banking market for opportunities, a relatively little
known outsider from the other side of the world, National Australia Bank,
unexpectedly bought Clydesdale and Northern Bank from Midland and became the
first large foreign entrant into the UK retail banking market.
Since then, barring a few mortgage operations, the large European banks have
stayed outside UK retail banking.
Meanwhile, National Australia has established a strong group of regional
banks in the UK and Ireland, including National Irish Bank and since April
1990, Yorkshire, the largest regional and one of the stars of the British
retail banking scene. It has spent a total of Pounds 1.5bn on the four
banks.
In return it has got an impressive cluster of regional banking subsidiaries.
Yorkshire has 261 branches and assets of Pounds 4.4bn with a 24 per cent
market share in the Yorkshire Humberside region.
Clydesdale has assets of Pounds 5.1bn and 346 branches and a 22 per cent
share in Scotland; Northern has assets of Pounds 2bn and 100 branches with a
34 per cent market share in Northern Ireland and nearly 50 per cent of the
commercial banking in the province.
National Irish Bank, a smaller Dublin-based bank, has Pounds 800m in assets
and 52 branches, 5 per cent of its national market.
National Australia has kept a low profile and many of its UK customers may
never have heard its name, but it is now the only well-established outside
presence in high street banking in the UK. And in a time of market
turbulence, so far none of its purchases has gone wrong.
'Our group performance is already superior to that of most of the banks in
the UK,' says Mr Alan Diplock, chief general manager, Australian Bank, who
headed the UK operations until recently.
Breaking into UK retail banking was a fateful step for a retail bank on the
other side of the world which had previously only had representative offices
in south east Asia and the US.
National Australia ranks as Australia's third largest bank with group assets
of ADollars 92.5bn (Pounds 41bn) of which ADollars 64.6bn are in Australia.
Judged by market capitalisation, it is the second largest bank.
A strong retail bank with a dominant position at home, it is in search of
larger markets outside its homeland, with its sights on opportunities in
regional retail banking. The choice was between the US and the UK. The
latter was selected mainly because opportunities arose at the right time.
Instead of trying to forge a new UK bank under its own name, National
Australia has kept its subsidiaries as separately branded units with a
strong regional flavour. At the same time it has tried to develop pooled
back office functions, such as computer systems, product development,
marketing, and credit policy.
The only serious snags so far seem to have come at Clydesdale where Pounds
5m of new cash had to be injected to improve computer systems and
procedures, along with Pounds 50m in retained earnings.
However, the processing and administration are an opportunity to cut costs
by centralising operations. National Australia has built a new processing
and information technology centre at Clydebank and is slowly converting it
from NCR to IBM.
The centre will eventually service all the group's UK retail banking
operations and develop systems for possible use by the group across the
world.
Yorkshire Bank, previously owned by four of the big clearers, was by far the
most expensive acquisition at Pounds 976.5m cash, three times its net asset
value. The high price raised some eyebrows.
'We had already banks in Northern Ireland and Scotland, and we wanted one in
England. It was more of the jigsaw and we had to pay to get it. It would
have been quite different if we had paid Pounds 1bn for Yorkshire as a
stand-alone operation.'
Mr Max Bray, who took over as UK general manager early this year, may find
his time is spent consolidating operations rather than planning fresh
purchases. But another acquisition cannot be ruled out.
Certainly National Australia has the cash. Early in 1990 it raised ADollars
1bn in a rights issue mainly for expansion.
'We are in an acquisitive mode at the moment,' said Mr Diplock. He added
that all suitable opportunities in the UK would be considered. At the moment
Yorkshire is expanding its branch network southwards at the rate of six new
branches a year.
At that rate, National Australia would take quite a while to achieve its
goal of branch coverage of the entire UK. The other options are to buy a
building society and incorporate its branch network or to 'cold-start' more
new branches.
Mr Diplock does not rule buying a building society but points out that its
attractiveness remains to be seen. It would be uncharted territory involving
persuading its members to vote for its demutualisation along the way and
retraining its staff.
He also pointed out: 'It is also impossible to know what premium you would
have to pay when a building society came on the market.'

FT  07 APR 92 / MGN to guarantee pension payments
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BANKS controlling more than half of Mirror Group Newspapers' shares have
agreed, after weeks of negotiations, to require any new owner to make up the
shortfall in its pension funds.
Ms Ann Scurfield, solicitor at Berwin Leighton which represents current MGN
employees, said the banks - and the company's administrators - had been
persuaded 'by sheer commercial logic' that the guarantee is needed to
reassure current employees that their pensions will be safe regardless of
who owns the company.
MGN's management has already agreed to make up the shortfall in the pension
fund - an amount estimated at Pounds 300m over the next 10 to 20 years -
left by the fraud of the late Mr Robert Maxwell.
A spokesman for the Mirror Group Management Consortium, a group headed by
Sir Peter Parker which is seeking a management buy-out of the paper,
yesterday welcomed the new clause. 'It puts other bidders on the same
footing as ourselves,' the spokesman said.
The group had offered to make up any deficit in the pension fund, although
the company's administrators had said there was no legal obligation for any
new owner to do so.
The amendment to the trust deed will create that legal obligation, but only
if the scheme is wound up, said Mr John Pearson, of solicitors Lovell White
Durrant which represents MGN
Under complex arrangements to salvage the pension funds, three new schemes
were set up. The first, which holds all the assets not stolen by Mr Maxwell
 -estimated at Pounds 115m to Pounds 150m - and any assets recovered from
banks, is being used to meet payments due to current pensioners.
The second, which is intended to pay past service pensions, has no assets
except for the annual contributions from MGN.
The third is a new scheme covering pension obligations of current employees
and funded by contributions from workers and the company.
Berwin Leighton also said steps have been taken to ensure the independence
of the pension scheme's current board of trustees. In addition to seven
management representatives, there will be five employee representatives, two
pensioner representatives and an independent chairman.

FT  07 APR 92 / Steelmakers' legacy faces a stern test: Robert Thomson on
why the back-to-basics ethic is popular in Japan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
With a colourful catalogue of new businesses that includes an artificial
beach, burglar alarms and a retirement village, as well as biotechnology and
electronics, Japan's steelmakers have been furiously diversifying. These
ambitious plans, inspired by an industry downturn in the mid-1980s, and
funded with the easy money of the late 1980s, are now being put to the test.
Sometimes with unhappy results. The reassessment comes as Japanese industry
is embracing the back-to-basics theme. Projects that were affordable, but
not necessarily profitable, when earnings were on the rise in 1989 have been
left exposed by the ebbing tide of profits.
Nippon Steel, the world's largest steelmaker, forecasts a 37.8 per cent fall
in pre-tax profits for the year just ended, and admits that most of its new
areas, ranging from laptop computers to a Space World theme park, are still
lossmakers. Mr Hiroshi Saito, president, has admitted that the pursuit of
some projects had been 'amateurish' and 'haphazard'.
Such difficulties are an embarrassment for the big five Japanese makers,
Nippon Steel, NKK, Kobe Steel, Sumitomo Metal and Kawasaki Steel, who
presumed that their access to funds, their size and, in the case of
electronics, their use of the product, would ensure success.
Now that demand in the Japanese economy is declining, the steel companies
have realised that they are more skilled as producers than as salesmen.
Having relied on long-established relationships and the marketing skills of
trading houses for steel sales, they are now having to court customers for
new building materials or semiconductors.
A Japanese saying tells of the humiliation felt by the samurai forced to do
business, but the steel samurai were forced to think as salesman in 1986
when crude steel production fell from 105m tonnes to 98m tonnes and the five
leading companies reported pre-tax losses. Each company then launched
programmes of rationalisation and diversification, expecting steel output to
decline to 90m tonnes by 1990.
Instead, the Japanese economy entered its longest economic boom which halted
late last year. The sprouting of construction projects and a surge in demand
from other traditional customers such as the car industry lifted steel
production to 110m tonnes in 1990 and restored the companies' confidence.
The industry correctly perceived that the boom would fade, and that
diversification programmes must continue, but its perception of the costs of
diversification was distorted by the gravity-defying Tokyo stock market. In
the late 1980s, there were easy profits to be made from selling long-held
stocks, and the market painlessly absorbed new equity issues. Confidence in
the market's strength prompted an interest in warrant bonds - Nippon Steel
issued Dollars 1.8bn (Pounds 1.04bn) in warrants between mid-1988 and early
1989, and Kobe Steel issued Dollars 2.1bn in warrants from October 1988
until June 1989.
But the stock market peaked at the end of 1989 and began its fall. Official
interest rates were pushed higher by the Bank of Japan, demand slowed for
new cars, while housing starts fell from 1.70m in 1990 to 1.37m last year.
The result was flat or slightly lower sales for the steelmakers and forecast
falls in pre-tax profit ranging from 11.5 per cent at Kobe Steel to 46.6 per
cent at Kawasaki Steel. Mr Minoru Hasegawa, steel industry specialist at SG
Warburg Securities, estimates that if diversification was 'focused', the
companies' profits would be 20 per cent to 30 per cent higher.
'Some of the companies really didn't think seriously about their
capabilities. They thought computer-related business would be important in
the future, so they got involved in electronics,' he said. 'The successful
diversifications have been those closely related to their existing
businesses.'
The steelmakers were particularly interested in semiconductors because they
presumed electronic devices would be the 'industrial rice' of the future.
They also chose projects in electronics and the service sector, including
restaurants, because these areas were suitable for absorbing workers left
idle by the rationalisation of steel oper-ations. Sumitomo Metal had
employed 30,000 workers in steelmaking, but by 1990, reduced the total to
21,000, with 4,000 dispatched to new areas.
The shift into high technology and services was also important in renovating
the image of companies concerned that their reputations had rusted.
Companies have found that adventure does not come cheap, and that steel
remains their most profitable business. They have revised downward their
ambitious goals for new areas and readjusted management styles. NKK says:
'We have learned that a business quite new to our traditional operation as a
steel supplier also needs a different management system.'
Kobe Steel, which has the longest-running and most successful
diversification programme, has announced 'Target 2000', an overhaul of a
long-term plan adopted in 1988. The company had expected new business to
account for Y90bn (Pounds 390m) of sales in 1991, but now the figure is
reckoned at Y66bn, while sales in long-established materials and machinery
divisions exceeded expectations.
Even for Kobe Steel, the outlays necessary to keep pace in the semiconductor
and biotechnology business have become a burden. Yet Kobe hopes that the
percentage of new business sales will increase from 5 per cent last year to
13 per cent in 1995 and 21 per cent by the year 2000.
However, the steelmakers are quietly shedding new businesses. One has scaled
down plans in ceramic products, another has put a low ceiling on
biotechnology, and yet another has halted production of a new line of
building materials. As Nippon Steel confessed, 'climbing a mountain is very
hard and there are still many more mountains to climb'.

FT  07 APR 92 / The Lex Column: British Aerospace
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Although Saudi Arabia has yet formally to place its mooted Tornado order,
its decision to allocate more funds to the Al-Yamamah defence deal is
undoubtedly good news for British Aerospace. The money will help finance the
working capital needed for a range of Al-Yamamah contracts. Saudi Arabia is
also signalling a flow of orders large enough to ensure that BAe can at
least maintain its dividend over the next couple of years, despite the
impact of recession on its motor and property divisions.
That justifies yesterday's 5 per cent jump in its share price. A yield of
more than 10 per cent even suggests scope for further recovery. But this is
limited by the weakness of the regional jet market and the overhang of
unsold shares from last year's rights issue, which are likely to start
flowing back into the market if the price rises much above 330p.

FT  07 APR 92 / The Lex Column: Hafnia
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Denmark's Hafnia offers a salutary lesson for those small to medium-sized
European insurers seeking to develop a 1990s strategy through co-operation
with their rivals. A measure of its enfeeblement lies in the fact that even
the diminished value of minority stakes in domestic competitor Baltica and
Sweden's Skandia is more than twice its own market capitalisation.
In attempting to convert the 33 per cent Baltica stake into a full merger,
Hafnia has already been shown the door. The question is whether yesterday's
suspension of its shares is the prelude to a successful conclusion of
negotiations to establish a Scandinavian alliance with Norway's UNI
Storebrand and Skandia. It remains hard to see why Skandia would want to
pool resources with weaker brethren, or indeed, given its defensive voting
structure, why it even has to contemplate the idea. Given the secrecy of the
talks, though - and the politics and personalities involved - it would be
silly to rule it out.
Hafnia shareholders can only hope that tomorrow's results contain no
unexpected nasties and that a cash buyer for the Baltica stake really is
waiting in the wings. They would be doubtless further cheered by any news of
a management shake-up.

FT  07 APR 92 / The Lex Column: Oil shares
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
UK investors should not be unduly excited by the 5 per cent jump in BP
shares yesterday. It was largely inspired by events in the US last Friday,
when worries about sanctions against Libya helped push the oil price up by
50 cents and oil shares, including BP, by around 3 per cent. There has been
no positive change in the fundamentals for oil prices, so such gains are
unlikely to stick for long.
Ever since BP's poor results in February, dealers in London have been only
too keen to sell to the US market, even when - as last week - that has left
them short of stock. A glance at the sector internationally suggests why US
investors have doubled their holdings in BP this year to 8 per cent. Whereas
the big US oil companies are yielding 5 per cent, compared with the market
average of less than 3 per cent, BP offers 8 per cent. The current year
multiple on its shares is now an unlikely 31, more than twice that of Exxon.
Yet the US market seems unconcerned by the fact that the yield is high for a
good reason, namely that BP's ability to maintain its dividend is
uncomfortably dependent on a broad economic recovery boosting the oil price.
The less sanguine approach of UK investors still has its merits.

FT  07 APR 92 / The Lex Column: Whitbread
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
In recent months, Whitbread has managed to establish itself as the most
harried of the UK brewers. Yesterday it produced two more pieces of bad
news, one perhaps less serious than it looks and the other more so. The
Pounds 37m exceptional write-off of loans to the free pub trade - around
one-sixth of annual net profits - implies a further sharp fall in pub values
in London and the south-east at a time when Whitbread still has 1,250 pubs
to release from the tie. But this will doubtless be addressed by leasing
deals. Meanwhile, the company comes close to promising that there will be no
further provisions in the annual figures due next month.
The news that Whitbread is cancelling several hundred million pounds worth
of investment in Pizza Hut on the continent may be more significant.
European retailing was to be Whitbread's big strategic growth area. The
announcement leaves it with just 45 restaurants and a hotel in Germany.
Given the way the shares have underperformed the sector of late, it might be
thought that the worst is in the price. It is just Whitbread's luck that its
dependence on eating out in London and the south-east also makes it the
brewer most exposed to a Labour victory.

FT  07 APR 92 / The Lex Column: Where credit is due
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The faint stirring of recovery suggested by the modest increase in
yesterday's UK consumer credit figures for February is probably more
reliable than the continuing recession implied by plummeting car sales in
March. Since the consumer credit data follow other positive indications -
from retail sales as well as imports - one wonders why incipient recovery is
not a campaign issue. But presumably no one believes Mr Norman Lamont's
protestations on the subject any more, while Mr John Smith would prefer the
electorate not to know. If recovery were already in train, he could not
claim credit later as chancellor.
Even the car figures are not as bad as they seem. The trend is distorted by
comparison with a 1991 month in which purchases were advanced ahead of the
increase in VAT. Adjusted for this, the slide in sales seems at least to be
levelling out. That is probably as much as one could expect, despite the
halving of car tax in this year's budget. Many buyers would probably now
prefer to wait till the K registration comes in August.
Still, the 2 per cent increase in new consumer credit over the past three
months marks only a fragile revival of confidence. It does not extend to the
housing market and could be killed stone dead by a rise in interest rates
after the election. The trouble with weekend forecasts to the contrary is
that they are based on models which make scant allowance for the effect on
confidence of higher base rates and falling house prices.

<TEXT>
Sir, Juliet Sychrava is in danger of raising false hopes when she says
('Election 1992: Outcome crucial for British Coal', April 3) that
competition from gas and imported coal would be welcomed in some quarters
'because it will put pressure on British Coal prices and thus on electricity
prices'. Imported coal at current prices and exchange rates does indeed put
pressure on British Coal prices (but not necessarily on electricity prices;
British Coal Corporation's 30 per cent real price reduction over the last
six years has hardly been reflected in electricity prices).
However, the introduction of gas-based generation on a large scale will not
bring the same price pressure for the simple reason that it will be more
expensive than the coal alternative. This was one of the points taken up by
the Energy Select Committee in its recent report.
The 'dash for gas' may result in further price pressure on British Coal as
the section of the fuelling market in which we compete is reduced in size.
This will not, I fear, necessarily lead to lower prices for electricity
consumers.

FT  07 APR 92 / Letter: Training of unemployed most hit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr STUART BISHELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The remarks by the leader of the group of 10 Training and Enterprise
Council chairs (G10) which you reported ('Tec warning on links with
government', April 3) underline the difficulties facing all those involved
with publicly financed training at present.
As the largest private training provider in the UK, Astra deals with more
than half of the Tecs and Local Enterprise Companies. We therefore gain a
broad picture of the provision of training for the unemployed. It is quite
clear from our experience that funding of this training is being cut for the
third consecutive year.
We also drew attention, in our recent evidence to the House of Commons
Employment Select Committee, to the inflexibility of funding and contracting
arrangements which restrict the freedom of action of Tecs.
Like the Confederation of British Industry, Astra has long supported the Tec
concept. Also like the CBI, we endorse the outgoing government's strategy
for encouraging employers to take increasing responsibility for meeting the
skill needs of the country. Yet Sir John Banham has only this week described
what is happening to Tecs as 'death by a thousand cuts'.
By contrast it is from those employers which, acting in tune with CBI
policy, do indeed invest in the skills of their workforces (and therefore in
the future of their companies) that Astra earns half of its income and most
of its profits. While this employer investment is slipping a little, it is
falling much less than in any previous recession.
It is public investment in training the unemployed that is being seriously
neglected at present. As far as we can tell, spending on employment training
is down about 5 per cent nationally (almost 10 per cent in real money
terms). At a time of rapidly rising unemployment that cannot be right.
When the long-awaited recovery gets under way, British industry is going to
need a skilled labour force. Let us hope that employers' willingness to
invest in achieving that is matched by a similar willingness on the part of
the incoming government, whatever its colour (or colours).

FT  07 APR 92 / Letter: Interruption on the line - or a disregard for threat
of deflation?
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr GILES KEATING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I suspect there must have been an interruption on the line cutting out
part of Lord Skidelsky's most enjoyable report of a telephone conversation
between Keynes and the British prime minister ('Keynes here, how can I help
you?', April 4). How else to explain the total lack of reference to debt
deflation or credit problems from Keynes, who in his current position has no
doubt been able to augment his own knowledge on this phenomenon with long
discussions with Irving Fisher.
Surely Keynes will have observed from his daily access to the FT that the
collapse of property companies, and many other enterprises, has been turning
bank profits negative and wiping out their capital, not just in the UK but
in Japan, the US, Canada and elsewhere, including Scandinavia, where
Norwegian government payments to support the bankrupt banking system have
reached some 4 per cent of gross national product.
Keynes will be bitterly aware that a bank without profits cannot raise new
capital, that a bank without capital cannot make new loans (especially under
the Bank for International Settlements rules), and that an economy cut off
from bank finance will deflate in a downward spiral as the resulting
contraction of economic activity undermines the soundness of existing loans
and wipes out more bank capital.
None of this is to deny that the opening up to capitalism of new world
regions (not just the former Russian empire mentioned in the phone call, but
more immediately south China and Latin America) offers the hope that the
1990s will have more in common with the 1890s than with the 1930s. But if
the industrialised world disappears into a debt-inflationary spiral,
economic and political reform in the 'new' regions would disappear too. We
would be left with the slow-growing, nationalistic, isolationist, militarist
regimes in Russia, Latin America and China.
The solution is not incomes policy (which never worked) but for central
banks worldwide to stop worrying excessively about inflation. They have
boxed themselves in with this talk, since bond markets now believe it to
such an extent that the immediate reaction to easing of policy in Germany,
Japan and the US can be higher long-term yields and thus yet more deflation.
Central banks must escape from this box by making clear that inflation is
not the danger in an environment of effectively unlimited cheap labour
supply from the new regions. The danger is deflation; the cure is lower
short-term interest rates presented in a way that does not force up
long-term rates. And not lower short-term rates in just some countries, with
competitive devaluations inside or outside the ERM. We need lower short-term
rates and more money supply globally.

FT  07 APR 92 / Leading Article: Conservatives and the Union
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
JOHN MAJOR has played the Union card, but he is unlikely to find it a trump.
The disillusioned home buyers of England are shaken by their economic
prospects, not stirred by past tunes of glory. Nor will Scots thus be
frightened into supporting the party of Mrs Thatcher's English ascendancy.
Even if Mr Major were to win by these means, his victory would be Pyrrhic. A
fourth Conservative term would be more likely to increase Scotland's
disillusionment than reconcile it to the status quo.
The worry is whether, however tactically inept, Mr Major is right to
prophesy that Scottish devolution would lead to dissolution of the UK. For
where he is correct is in his belief that the Union is worth preserving.
Scots do not disagree. According to the polls, parties supporting the Union
are likely to obtain almost three quarters of the Scottish vote. At the same
time, the party supporting the status quo is likely to get less than a
quarter of the vote. How then can the Scots be denied what they obviously
want: a greater degree of autonomy within a still United Kingdom?
They cannot be. The question is rather how that desire can be accommodated.
The difficulty - the so-called 'west Lothian question' - is how to reconcile
Scottish home rule with politically legitimate government in England.
Untenable solution
The Labour party hopes to have its cake while eating it. It plans to rule
Scotland with its Scottish votes, but also to rule England with its Scottish
votes. It intends to give a new Scottish parliament control over local
government, health, housing, transport, the environment and some economic
powers, including the right to alter income tax by 3p in the pound.
Meanwhile, it wishes to introduce a feebler form of regional government into
England, but otherwise to rule England from Westminster on the basis of a
presence that will probably include some 50 Scottish members. This would
prove no more tenable a solution than the status quo is to Scotland now.
An ad hoc solution would be to reduce Scottish representation from its
present level of 72 MPs to a more demographically correct level of around
58. The justification for combining Scottish devolution with government of
England by a Westminster parliament with such a reduced Scottish
representation, would be that Scotland is so outweighted by England in the
determination of the Union's common policies that its voters should be
allowed a compensating say in English internal matters. The acceptability of
such a solution to the English (if not to the Labour party) might be further
enhanced by lowering Scottish representation at Westminster below that
justified by its share in the population of the UK.
Alternative way
An alternative solution would be to admit that what is sauce for the
Scottish goose is sauce for the English gander. Yet if only English
representatives could vote on purely English matters, there might have to be
a separate government of England. Even if limited to supposedly internal
matters, such a government would be an even more formidable rival to the
Union government than Mr Yeltsin's Russia was to Mr Gorbachev's Soviet
Union.
Finally, England might be federalised. Provided the powers given to the new
'states' were roughly comparable to those granted to the proposed Scottish
parliament, this would avoid the anomalies of the other two options. But
there remains a large problem. England has no history that would support
such a division. Local government is one thing; federation another.
The demand for a degree of Scottish self-government cannot be resisted. On
this, Mr Major is wrong and the Labour party quite right. But the Union
should also be preserved. This cannot be done if Scottish self-government is
not combined with further radical changes to the government of the UK.
Somehow a way must be found, acceptable to people on both sides of the
border, that will preserve the Union, while giving Scotland the autonomy it
seeks. Nobody should be fooled into believing it will be easy to find;
nobody should be fooled into believing it can be found without deep changes
in British government; but nobody should be fooled into believing that it
can be stopped by just saying no.

FT  07 APR 92 / Mr Major's new passion
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOE ROGALY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Major must know something about the British people that the rest of
us have failed to grasp. That is one explanation for what seems to be his
eccentric choice of topic over the past few days. Another is that he has
been addressing a subject that he believes to be important, with little
thought for the electoral bottom line. It beats me. Perhaps he suspects he
has nothing left to lose.
The story began on Sunday. Labour was at least two percentage points ahead.
The Conservatives faced probable defeat. What did our prime minister do? He
spoke about Scotland - at a meeting in London. He warned of the danger of
the break-up of the United Kingdom. This is an important subject. Half of
Scotland and at least 2 per cent of England must have found it fascinating.
To my mind, which may be cluttered with the orthodoxies of the campaign,
that wasted a day. This may not matter. Many Conservatives believe that you
cannot gain by politicking on a Sunday. Let us say that little advantage was
lost.
Yesterday was harder to understand. I had been in touch with Labour on
Sunday. 'What will you concentrate on this week?' The answer came smoothly -
'the recession, the health service - and, as a sleeper, poll tax'. Sharp on
7.45 yesterday morning, the Labour team sauntered in to their press
conference, their dark suits enlivened by red roses freshly pinned in place.
Mr Neil Kinnock was there. So was Mr John Smith. They were accompanied by
Mrs Margaret Beckett, Mr Gordon Brown and Mr Tony Blair. Mr Jack Cunningham
took the chair.
One after another the members of this proto-cabinet read out smooth prepared
statements on the recession and how Labour proposed to get the country out
of it. The press corps - including representatives of pro-Conservative
newspapers - appeared to be charmed. Mr Kinnock, glowing in the artificial
aura of authority bestowed upon him by his opinion poll lead, put on his
special low, slow, serious voice to answer questions. He was not given any
trouble.
Over to the Conservative session. In came the prime minister, accompanied by
Mr Chris Patten, the party chairman, and Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign
secretary. They looked dolorous. Prepared statements were read out. The
prime minister spoke about Scotland and the danger of the break-up of the
United Kingdom, Mr Hurd about how 'a hung parliament would hang the
recovery'. The questioning was brisk, and sceptical.
This is baffling. The hung parliament warning makes some sort of tactical
sense. The Conservatives do need to convince their supporters that voting
Liberal Democrat could give victory to Labour. Against that, the very
mention of an outcome with no overall majority is a contradiction in terms
for a party that insists that it will win outright. It is a high-risk
strategy to keep the constitutional debate, arcane to many voters, on the
agenda.
The warnings about Scotland may appeal to Tory party workers for whom the
preservation of the union and the sanctity of parliament are articles of
faith, but can they tempt English floating voters rightwards? 'It would have
been better if he had warned about mortgages going up under Labour,'
muttered a prominent Thatcherite as we left.
It is difficult to see how negative campaigning on constitutional reform at
this late stage will help the Conservatives. The Liberal Democrats are
fighting a single-issue campaign, but they have little choice. Electoral
reform is their principal reason for existence. Labour deploys its Scottish
and general constitutional proposals from time to time but this is
explicable as an effort to win the voters' trust by professing a willingness
to share power. It is directly threatened by the Scottish nationalists. It
must respond. It does so - in Scotland. The Tories have nothing to bring to
this debate. They would be better off saying nothing.
It is a fair bet that Mr Major has been made aware of this opinion as held
by some of his colleagues, but he has disregarded it. His mission as he sees
it is to save the constitution from those who would ravage it. This is a
recent development. It has three strands. Following his exertions at the
Maastricht summit he came to regard the threat to Britain inherent in a
federal Europe as of overriding importance. As prime minister, he has
developed a strong awareness of what he sees as the threat to the union
implicit in Scottish separatism. Latterly, the campaign has released in him
a powerful historical sense of the importance of parliament in its
traditional form. The strength of this particular feeling came as a surprise
to everybody, including, just possibly, Mr Major himself. These are all
serious matters.
Mr Major has alluded to them before, but his words have not been
satisfactorily reported. On Sunday, and again yesterday, he felt he just had
to speak out. Perhaps it will help his image. His previously unsuspected
passion may not win him the election, but it is no less noble for that.

FT  07 APR 92 / Arts: Isaac Asimov - Obituary
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GAY FIRTH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Isaac Asimov, the Russian-born US writer who died yesterday at the age of
72, was probably the best-known 20th century author of science fiction,
writes Gay Firth.
Born in 1920, he received a PhD in biochemistry from Columbia University,
New York, but at 38 left teaching to write full-time. 'Sci-fi' formed only
part of his output. As prolific as he was popular, about 400 books for lay
readers cover a variety of scientific topics, such as The Human Brain (1964)
and The Collapsing Universe (1977).
Of about 100 sci-fi novels and stories - many made into films - his short
story Nightfall (1941) is possibly the best. The most interesting may prove
to be a landmark trilogy, Foundation (1951-1953), built round a version of
social determinism transplanted to a trans-galactic community.
Asimov's unshaken faith in the potential of technology to bring order to
society placed him among the most well-meaning of writers. He developed his
sci-fi subjects and his style (readable, but somewhat stolid) while
contributing to the magazine Astounding, and stuck to them for 50 years.
The I, Robot series of novels (which introduced Asimov's Three Laws of
Robotics, the first of which states that 'A robot may not injure a human
being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm') brought
critical mockery, even notoriety, for their degree of mechanical dialogue
from their all-too-robotic human characters.

FT  07 APR 92 / Arts: Two Strauss sopranos
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Since the last round of musical chairs in conductors' appointments, Kurt
Masur has come to look increasingly influential. From his triple power-base
in Leipzig, New York and London, he presides over musical centres in both
the old and new worlds, from which he can forge important partnerships in
music-making.
Over the past fortnight he has made two appearances in London. One was as a
guest with his own Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra, the other with the London
Philharmonic, of which he is principal guest conductor. But on each occasion
the spotlight fell on the soloist he brought with him, in each case a
leading soprano. Both are comparatively rare visitors to this country, and
both sang Masur's favoured composer, Richard Strauss.
At the Royal Festival Hall with the London Philharmonic on Saturday, the
singer was Kathleen Battle. A favourite in New York, her artistic home, Miss
Battle entered looking like a fairy-tale princess and went on to play the
starring role that was expected of her with consummate artistry.
There is indeed a magic about her singing, though that is in part because
the voice is so small that the audience has to sit in hushed attentiveness
to hear her at all in a hall of this size. With that in mind, she had chosen
her Strauss songs carefully. A pair of the Brentano Lieder, natural material
for a Zerbinetta, were gossamer-light, spun with an exquisitely fine thread
of sound. 'Waldseligkeit' floated effortlessly. Only 'Morgen' disappointed,
too fast and insubstantial.
It was with a group of Duparc songs that her limitations really became
apparent. A brief thought back to Janet Baker in the opening lines of
'Phidyle' was enough to make Battle seem monochrome and inexpressive by
comparison. The other songs, too, were rendered sweet nothings, charmingly
sung, but saccharine and shallow. At least the singer was fortunate that
Masur was such a considerate accompanist, allowing every wisp of sound to be
heard.
There could hardly have been a greater contrast with the other concert 10
days earlier. This was at the Barbican, in the Great Orchestras of the World
series, when Masur brought the Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra over for an
all-Strauss programme. The singer on this occasion should not by rights have
been the raison d'etre of the evening, but she was - firstly because the
orchestral items were meagre, secondly because the singer was Julia Varady
in the Four Last Songs.
Next to Battle's flighty, girlish Strauss, this was adult singing and no
mistake. Varady possesses one of the true Straussian voices of the day, the
tone ample and unforced, even at the most taxing moments. She took her time
with the music, breathing wherever necessary, and gave the songs a dignity
and a generous soaring breadth that are all too rare. The Four Last Songs
have never sounded greater.

<TEXT>
Judging from the output of television drama departments, you might imagine
that the only two spheres of human activity where people came into contact
with life and death matters were crime and medicine. Tuesdays are now
bringing us yet another detective series, Resnick: Lonely Hearts (10.00
BBC1) and yet another hospital series, Medics (9.00 ITV). Predictably
Resnick is yet another 'unconventional' policeman: lives on gherkin and
mustard sandwiches, listens to trad jazz, and sees ghosts.
The new series of Medics is nothing like the pilot last year: instead of
young housemen bedding one another we now have Tom Baker doing his familiar
manic grin over a surgeon's mask.
One day perhaps, drama departments will discover that life also occurs on
farms, in shops, at sea, and elsewhere.
Life in Hackney is much in the news: last night brought a programme about
policing the London borough and today 40 Minutes reports on efforts being
made by Hackney Council to evict squatters. The idea is to let the
properties and save nearly Pounds 6m a year from the costs of keeping people
in bed and breakfast accommodation.

FT  07 APR 92 / Arts: Weekend recitals - Queen Elizabeth Hall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAX LOPPERT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sylvia McNair has achieved her leap into the affections of the London public
with remarkable speed. A single appearance each at Glyndebourne and Covent
Garden and several more in various South Bank and Barbican concerts served
to introduce her; last Friday's song recital at the Queen Elizabeth Hall
completed the picture.
It was a delight from beginning to end. In common with her fellow American
Barbara Bonney, she uses a light-lyric soprano of ravishing quality with a
forthrightness unusual in the breed. This was not just a sustained
demonstration of words and notes purely uttered, of phrases cleanly traced
with not an ounce of waste or cloudiness in the delivery - though all of
those virtues were abundantly in evidence. It was a recital by a sharply
honed artistic personality, with grace, wit and intelligence as its
particular characteristics.
In the opening Purcell group, Miss McNair's way of gracing the words, while
holding her line immaculately taut, showed off the lineaments of her
imagination quite as much as attributes of her voice. In a selection of Hugo
Wolf's Morike songs, her infusion of dramatic vitality into every poetic and
musical image betokened a keenly personal, individual perception of Wolfian
scale.
This was a bouquet of pleasures out of all proportion to their length,
especially with so admirably responsive a pianist as Roger Vignoles to
support their inspiration. In Strauss, the voice, free of all 'Viennese'
mannerisms, can nevertheless shine and soar with all the needed lissomeness
of movement. Perhaps most appealing of all was her closing selection of
Leonard Bernstein songs: the I Hate Music and La Bonne Cuisine cycles, the
two Rilke love songs and 'Somewhere' as tenderly unsentimental finale.
In such material is all too easy to go coy, sassy or plain mushy; instead,
Miss McNair's cool tones and flick-of-the-eyelid comic underplaying opened
out unsuspected dimensions in all the songs. She has made many people
extremely impatient for her next recital.
* On Sunday afternoon, Piotr Anderszewski crept sullenly on to the same
platform, threw his audience a cursory bow, and proceeded to offer just
about the most worrying display by a talented young pianist that I can
remember. Mr Anderszewski is the young Pole who sparked interest at the last
Leeds piano competition by suddenly departing the second round in
mid-performance. This indicated a refreshing capacity for self-criticism;
the main quality demonstrated on Sunday was a debilitating combination of
eccentricity and narcissism.
The hall lights were plunged low while Mr Anderszewski communed with himself
at length in Bach's E minor Partita, stroking the melodic phrases with
hyper-romantic delicacy and reducing even the most vigorous dances to a slow
crawl. It was a personal vision of Bach - obviously sincere and achieved
with the most fastidious technical control - that quickly proved tedious.
Mr Anderszewski seems to lack the intellectual toughness that redeemed Glenn
Gould's similar eccentricities in Bach: he moons over the music. After the
same dynamic effects and extremes of tempo had been operated on Beethoven's
Op. 119 Bagatelles, to even more irritating end, I fled from the hall, thus
sparing myself his Beethoven Op. 110. I pray this outstandingly gifted young
man acquires a mature mentor on the art of recital-giving before doing his
reputation any further damage.

Hoping that his experience proves the marketplace for economists in the City
is still alive is Richard Jeffrey who, three months after being made
redundant from one stock-broker, has just landed a top job with another.
Jeffrey, 34, takes over next week as head of research at Charterhouse
Tilney, a leading agency stockbroker; he previously held a similar position
at Hoare Govett.
Jeffrey, who lost his last job after the firm sacked large sections of its
research team, says he spent his three months away from the City recharging
his batteries and seeing more of his three children.
He will take over a research team of 25. About a third of these are in
London, where Jeffrey will be based, and the rest in Liverpool where
Charterhouse Tilney has a strong regional presence.
Jeffrey spent 10 years at Hoare Govett where he built up a reputation for
independent thought on economic matters. He thinks Britain made a big
mistake joining the European exchange rate mechanism and thinks the high
interest rates and slump in house prices of the past year make the economic
outlook for Britain extremely gloomy.

Henderson Administration, the fund management company, has moved to bolster
confidence in its investment skills by recruiting Ian Buckley from Sun Life
Asset management to head its group investment business. Ben Wray, who has
been heading that section, will remain Henderson's deputy chairman and
chairman of the investment policy committee.
Henderson, following patchy investment performance in the late 1980s, has
had a net loss of its key pension fund clients. In 1991, it listed 187
pension funds for which it managed money, down from 246 in 1989.
Buckley, 43, who had a reputation as a no-nonsense manager at Sun Life, was
in charge of global asset allocation policy there. At the moment, Buckley
says, his portfolio is heavily invested in cash awaiting the outcome of the

some handsome buying opportunities among UK equities. Significantly, his new
job at Henderson does not begin until May.

FT  07 APR 92 / FT Law Report: Court identifies Lloyd's Names issues
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RACHEL DAVIES, Barrister
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ASHMORE AND OTHERS v CORPORATION OF LLOYD'S
House of Lords (Lord Keith of Kinkel, Lord Roskill, Lord Bridge of Harwich,
Lord Templeman and Lord Goff of Chieveley): April 1 1992
A LITIGANT has no legitimate expectation that trial will proceed to a
conclusion on the evidence to be adduced, and the judge's decision to hear
preliminary issues of law before ascertaining whether it is necessary to go
on to hear evidence should be respected by the parties and upheld by an
appellate court, unless he was plainly wrong.
The House of Lords so held when allowing an appeal by the defendant, the
Corporation of Lloyd's, from a Court of Appeal decision setting aside Mr
Justice Gatehouse's order that preliminary issues of law should be tried in
an action by the plaintiffs, Patricia Ashmore and 30 other Lloyd's Names.
LORD TEMPLEMAN said Lloyd's was a society of underwriters incorporated by
statute and authorised to exercise supervisory, regulatory and disciplinary
powers over its members.
The plaintiff Names were underwriting members of Lloyd's, organised in
syndicates.
The relationship between Lloyd's and a member was governed by its
constitution, membership documents and written agreement. If a Name was a
member of a syndicate, business must be carried on by a managing agent
approved by Lloyd's, and the Name must not interfere.
The plaintiffs became Names at various times between January 20 1971 and
December 30 1981, and were members of syndicates managed by Oakeley Vaughan
(Underwriting) Ltd.
They claimed damages from Lloyd's for losses on insurance contracts entered
into by OVU as managing agent in 1980, 1981, 1982 and 1983.
They issued their writ on August 28 1987 and served points of claim. The
trial was fixed for October 8 1990. In August 1990, they obtained leave to
make extensive amendments to the points of claim. The trial began before Mr
Justice Gatehouse on April 22 1991.
Plaintiffs' counsel had reached day seven in his opening when he applied to
make further substantial amendments to the points of claim. The application
was resisted and took five days to argue.
The judge allowed the amendments. He was reluctant to do so at so late a
stage.
Lloyd's submitted that, since substantial further amendments had been
allowed and the trial interrupted and prolonged, preliminary points of law
should be ordered to decide whether Lloyd's owed each plaintiff any of the
duties alleged in the points of claim and to decide the extent and
application of its statutory immunity from suit.
The judge ordered preliminary points of law to be argued. The plaintiffs
appealed. The Court of Appeal set aside the order. On the present appeal
Lloyd's asked that it be restored.
It would be necessary for the judge eventually to decide whether Lloyd's
owed any duty in law to the plaintiffs. It seemed sensible that that
decision should be made at the outset of the trial.
If the decision was in the plaintiffs' favour, the judge, having defined the
relevant duty, might logically proceed to hear evidence to decide whether
Lloyd's acted in breach of duty. If it owed no duty, the action would end
without further delay, expense or harassment of witnesses.
Mr Justice Gatehouse ordered that questions as to duty of care and statutory
immunity from suit be tried as preliminary issues. It was agreed that the
immunity issue was suitable for preliminary decision.
Before deciding to make the order, the judge considered the dangers involved
and the House of Lords guidance in Tilling v Whiteman (1980) AC 1.
When a judge alive to the possible consequences decided a particular course
should be followed in the conduct of the trial in the interests of justice,
his decision should be respected by the parties and upheld by an appellate
court unless there were very good grounds for thinking he was plainly wrong.
The plaintiffs' first objection to the preliminary issues was that the
points of law to be determined did not cover their case that there was a
duty in tort.
If Lloyd's owed a duty by statute or contract, the preliminary issue would
be decided in the plaintiffs' favour. But if no duty was imposed by statute
or contract it did not appear that a duty could have arisen in tort.
It was said that if no duty in tort existed when a Name became a member of
Lloyd's, such a duty arose later towards plaintiffs who were Names on March
6 1981. That alleged duty was never clearly pleaded, but arose, so it was
now said, when a Lloyd's committee member suggested amendments to and
approved a letter dated March 6 1981, sent out by OVU to its Names.
The letter commented on a Lloyd's press release and press reports of a
Lloyd's investigation into aspects of OVU's business conduct. It was said
that in September 1981 Lloyd's discovered facts from which it should have
realised that the letter ought to be corrected.
But Lloyd's never assumed responsibility for the letter. The plaintiffs had
no right to rely on Lloyd's for the accuracy of its contents. The letter
could not have created a duty in tort if no such duty existed beforehand.
The second objection was that the points of law could not be decided in
advance of oral evidence concerning 'admissions' alleged to have been made
by Lloyd's committee members.
The court's task in deciding whether statute had imposed a duty on Lloyd's
towards each member could not be affected by subsequent remarks of a
committee member.
In the points of claim allegations against OVU were confused and difficult
to follow. It was pleaded that by late September 1981 Lloyd's was or ought
to have been well aware that OVU was thoroughly unfit to act as managing
agent; that the facts required Lloyd's to act to protect the plaintiffs; and
that Lloyd's, in breach of duty, wrongfully permitted OVU to continue
underwriting and failed to inform the plaintiffs of the facts.
It was not said that Lloyd's came under a duty to suspend OVU until late
September 1981. It was unclear from the pleadings whether or when a duty to
give information arose and was broken, but the loss and damage claimed to
have been suffered included losses on contracts underwritten in 1980, 1981,
1982 and 1983.
The parties and legal advisers in any litigation were under a duty to
co-operate with the court by chronological, brief and consistent pleadings
which defined the issues and left the judge to draw his own conclusions
about the merits.
It was counsel's duty to assist the judge by simplification and
concentration.
There had been a tendency in some cases for legal advisers, pressed by
clients, to make every point conceivable and inconceivable without judgment
or discrimination.
Where a judge for reasons which were not plainly wrong made an interlocutory
decision or made a decision in the course of a trial, it should be respected
by the parties. If it was not respected it should be upheld by an appellate
court unless the judge was plainly wrong.
Mr Justice Gatehouse thought he would be assisted by early deliberation of
issues of law. He deserved support.
Control of the proceedings rested with the judge, not the plaintiffs. An
expectation that the trial would proceed to a conclusion on the evidence to
be adduced was not a legitimate expectation. The only legitimate expectation
of any plaintiff was to receive justice.
The appeal was allowed.
LORD ROSKILL agreeing, said it was part of the trial judge's duty to
identify crucial issues and see they were tried as expeditiously and
inexpensively as possible. Litigants were not entitled to uncontrolled use
of his time. Others awaited their turn. Litigants were only entitled to so
much time as was necessary for proper determination of the relevant issue.
Their Lordships agreed with both judgments.

<TEXT>
Ten per cent of businesses which qualify for the BS5750 quality assurance
standard recoup their costs within two years while half recover expenditure
within three years, according to a survey by SGS Yarsley, the third largest
UK certification organisation.
The average cost of registration for companies employing more than 75 people
is Pounds 70,000, comprising registration fees of Pounds 6,000, consultancy
fees of Pounds 4,000 and internal staff costs.
Savings were made on overtime payments, administration, cutting out
unnecessary procedures and staff productivity, the survey of 100 companies
showed.
Fifty two per cent of companies registered because of pressure from large
customers; 21 per cent to improve efficiency; and five per cent to cut
waste.
While just over 7 per cent of UK companies are wound up each year only 0.2
per cent of BS5750 companies fail, SGS said.

foreign exchange - In A Nutshell
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The cost and time taken in making small-value money transfers across borders
has long been a source of annoyance to business.
Eleven European co-operative banks have joined up to establish a system
which they claim will halve the cost of cross-border payments to small
businesses and personal customers and provide agreed completion times.
The new grouping, known as TIPA (Transferts Interbancaires de Paiements
Automatises), claims that TIPA-NET is the first Europe-wide payments network
compared with the more limited hub-based systems operated by some other
banks.
New services and payment instruments will be added as the system develops.
TIPA members say they will quote a price to customers and there will be no
additional charges.
The new service is designed to appeal to customers making payments below the
level at which the banks' SWIFT transfer system becomes cost-effective.
TIPA's members comprise co-op banks in Austria, Belgium, Canada, France,
Germany (four), Italy (two) and the UK (The Co-Operative Bank) but talks are
taking place with potential members elsewhere in the European Community and
in the US.

FT  07 APR 92 / Football strike vote helps goal
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE English soccer players trade union, the Professional Footballers
Association, discovered yesterday what the mainstream trade unions learnt
some time ago - that strike ballots are a godsend in negotiations.
No sooner had the PFA announced that 91 per cent of its first division
members had voted to support strike action than the Premier League - with
which the PFA is in dispute over revenue from TV coverage - suddenly
presented an improved offer. As a result, there will be no industrial action
for the immediate future.
The PFA has rejected a Premier League offer of 5 per cent of the proceeds of
TV coverage of the new league. Under its present agreement with the Football
League, the PFA gets 10 per cent of TV revenue.

Poverty
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HOW WILL Pilton vote? The question is of unusual interest to the political
parties this year. This is because the electors of this deprived cluster of
Edinburgh estates are being wooed by both official and deselected Labour
candidates, casting uncertainty over the party's 11,327 majority in the
city's Leith constit uency.
There are, however, bigger questions, most notably how many people living in
Pilton's more rundown blocks and terraces will bother to vote at all.
A striking economic phenomenon of the 1980s was a growing disparity in
income and wealth between the richest and poorest sections of the
population. This widening division has been accompanied by discussion about
whether Britain is witnessing, in its inner cities and peripheral estates,
the emergence of a social group which is outside the norms and values of
mainstream society.
Pilton is one of four UK areas involved in Poverty 3, a European Community
anti-poverty programme. An EC profile of Pilton provides a composite picture
typical of many of Britain's less-advantaged communities.
Unemployment is double the Edinburgh average; only about a third of the
workforce have full-time jobs; half of those without jobs are long-term
unemployed; between 70 per cent and 80 per cent of the population rely on
state benefits for all or part of their income.
In addition, the proportion of children qualifying for free school meals in
the area's nine primary schools ranges from 31 per cent to 91 per cent. A
majority of children receive free meals in all except two schools. Drug
abuse is extensive, and health problems and premature death are far more
prevalent than in areas with greater advantages.
Yet Pilton is not defeatist about its difficulties. One evening last week,
about 60 people attended one of the local forum meetings through which
Edinburgh District Council is trying to improve community contact.
Most items on the agenda would be unrecognisable as concerns to the
inhabitants of suburbia, but they read like an action-list of imperatives in
places such as Pilton: efforts to improve council service-standards so that
problems are dealt with within 14 days; setting up a council office in
Pilton so that residents do not have to travel into central Edinburgh to
discuss problems; racial harassment; the closure of the accident and
emergency unit at the local hospital, forcing people without cars to take
children to the city centre.
The debate is vigorous and articulate, because many of those present are
politically active or involved in community organisations. They are a
minority.
Some 35,000 people live in the Pilton EC project area and most would never
attend such a meeting. Some 'just sit at home demoralised by unemployment
and poverty', one person says.
Do the people who are relatively disadvantaged actually regard themselves as
in poverty?
Mr John Mulvey, director of the EC project in Pilton, says: 'People tend not
to like the term because of widespread implications that poverty is somehow
the fault of the individual.'
The scheme's title, Pilton Poverty Programme, was disliked by local people
and is now underplayed in favour of the Pilton Partnership Project.
Also people who understandably resent being labelled 'poor' shudder at the
imported US term 'underclass', now part of the sociological vocabulary in
Britain. It is used to describe those that fit no conventional class
category and are detached from mainstream values.
Sir Ralf Dahrendorf, the warden of St Antony's College, Oxford, has written
of the underclass as the 'living doubt in the prevailing values which will
eat into the texture of the societies in which we are living'.
There is not universal agreement that an underclass - as opposed to deprived
people - actually exists. Research published this month by the independent
Policy Studies Institute estimates that the underclass doubled from about 2m
in 1979 to 4m in 1986, but this was based on a tight definition confined to
families which are excluded from paid work.
Applying this definition, only 68 per cent of the underclass voted in the
1987 general election, compared with 82 per cent of the employed. This
year's voting patterns will be studied for evidence that people who are
relatively disadvantaged may have become further alienated from the
mainstream of society.
The question of whether a permanent underclass is emerging is not only a
matter for academic study. The existence of such a group, millions strong,
whose members feel little attachment to society could have alarming
implications and become a leading election issue by the turn of the century.
In the present election, however, poverty is not central to the campaign.
The Child Poverty Action Group's pre-election analysis of the three main
programmes concludes that 'in the 50th anniversary year of the Beveridge
report we need a more fundamental commitment to preventing poverty - not
merely patching it up - and to the redistribution of resources than any of
the three main parties' manifestos is currently offering'.

FT  07 APR 92 / Election 1992: Labour stresses housing 'crisis'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LONDON homeowners have seen the value of their houses decline by Pounds 27bn
in three years, Labour claimed yesterday.
Outlining a seven-point plan to ameliorate the capital's housing problems,
the party said the 'crisis' was affecting all sectors from the homeless to
those 'with mortgage debts bigger than their houses are worth'.
The party also moved to reject Conservative claims that a government under
Mr Neil Kinnock would bring higher mortgage rates in its wake, arguing that
interest rates were historically higher under Tory governments.
'The record is incontrovertible - every time you elect a Tory government,
you guarantee that interest rates will rise,' said Mr Bryan Gould, shadow
environment secretary. 'That's what would happen again if people were silly
enough to re-elect a Tory government.'
Labour's plans include an emergency programme for the homeless, considering
letting first-time buyers concentrate tax relief in the early years of their
loans and setting up a national housing bank to increase the supply of homes
for rent without directly adding to government spending. Among its other
functions, the bank would offer a way of recycling local authority capital
receipts back into housing without adding to the public sector borrowing
requirement. The party is still non-committal about how quickly this
recycling would occur, however.
Housing is viewed as a particularly important issue in the 84 seats of
Greater London, where it is thought the votes of heavily-mortgaged C2s - the
skilled working classes - will have a crucial bearing on the outcome in
several marginal constituencies.

FT  07 APR 92 / Election 1992: Marginal York squares up to a grand old fight
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Conal Gregory, the Conservative defending the York constituency, insists
he is sleeping soundly at night.
This could lead to one of three conclusions: the elegant Master of Wine,
holder of the Tories' slimmest majority in Britain, is optimistic, realistic
or resigned to defeat.
Officially, of course, Mr Gregory is optimistic about retaining the seat he
wrested back from Labour in 1983 with a 3,647 majority and clung on to in
1987 with 25,880 votes against Labour's 25,733 - a majority of just 147.
In conversation, he is realistic, pointing out that York has long been a
marginal seat, bouncing since the war between Labour and the Conservatives.
Then he says: 'I know, if fairness was anything to play by, that would be a
big factor in my getting re-elected.'
There are few things on which Mr Gregory and Mr Hugh Bayley, his Labour
rival whom he beat in 1987, agree. Least of all Mr Bayley's political hue -
'very hard left', according to Mr Gregory, or 'chair of the Yorkshire Region
Fabian Society', according to Mr Bayley's press briefing.
Mr Bayley, a York University health economist, insists that his campaign has
been a clean fight.
The candidates agree that both their parties traditionally enjoy a large
bedrock of support in this tightly drawn constituency. Mr Gregory says:
'It's the third party which tends to decide the issue.'
The superb heritage and upmarket air of York's centre are misleading. The
city also has expanses of terraced housing, underpinning its industrial
role. York may be the jam but many middle-class voters live in the doughnut
of Tory-held rural seats encircling it.
Mr Gregory, who is vocal on consumer affairs, hopes to have York's chocolate
and sweet industry, employing 8,000 people, on his side. However, the
crucial 6,500 rail-industry voters may prove more elusive.
He is scathing about 'sabre rattling' by workers at Brel, the privatised
train maker. The workers have been lobbying the government to help British
Rail place a Pounds 130m order for carriages for Network SouthEast.
The news during the campaign, in a letter to Mr Gregory from transport
minister Mr Roger Freeman, that BR plans to place the order soon, ought in
theory to bolster the Tories' electoral chances in York as Brel's works in
the city hopes to win the work.
However, Mr Gregory's trenchant criticism not only of Brel workers but also
of their privatised management may cost him votes. Government talk of rail
privatisation has also triggered anxieties about jobs.
Mr Steve Kenwright of the Green party is more likely to dent Mr Bayley's
support than Mr Gregory's. In 1987 the Green party attracted 637 votes. Of
greater importance in this fight is Miss Karen Anderson, the Liberal
Democrat candidate and a community care development officer employed by the
diocese of York.
In 1987 the SDP's vote slumped by 3,625 to 9,898, apparently to Labour's
benefit. Miss Anderson says: 'It was the tactical squeeze; we think it's
already happened.'
The Budget's concessions on the Uniform Business Rate should help Mr Gregory
but a mere 0.1% swing will cost him his seat.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
ARE the Tories being maltreated by the press? The very question sounds a bit
of an April Fool given the political bent of the bulk of Britain's tabloids.
Yet yesterday at the end of another less-than-uplifting Conservative news
conference, that was the view of one disgruntled spin doctor who claimed
that Mr Neil Kinnock was undergoing softer questioning than his Tory
opponent.
Perhaps there is a case to answer. But it is hard to make a judgment about
unfair treatment - if, indeed, there is such - without accepting the natural
imbalances that stem from a three-term government on the defensive and an
Opposition with its tail up.
Morale is all. And though there is barely more than a statistical blur
between the two parties in the polls, the contrast in mood between the camps
has had its consequences. Two examples emerged yesterday.
In the morning Mr Trevor Kavanagh, political editor of The Sun, asked why
the prime minister was raising the dangers of a hung parliament at a time
when his party was promising an outright victory. Before the question was
even out an irritated Mr Major felt forced to interrupt him.
In the afternoon a hostile reporter shouted a question at Mr Kinnock,
demanding to know why he had refused an interview for the 5m readers of the
Daily Mail. Before the Labour leader had time to respond, a chorus of
knowing laughter from his supportive audience of business people and
academics made a serious response redundant.
'I think you have got your answer,' Mr Kinnock replied to a stoney-faced
questioner who clearly thought he had not.
Labour's media campaign has been a mixture of fast footwork, good planning
and good luck. The shadow Budget - the party's opening shot - combined all
three. By putting up the stolid Mr John Smith to tough out the hard
number-crunching questions with the economics correspondents, Mr Kinnock
escaped the ordeal for which he is widely deemed least well equipped.
The luck came when the Conservative reply was to centre on the iniquity of
penalising those on Pounds 21,000-plus a year, rather than to pick away at
the Budget's seams.
At the outset, too, Mr Jack Cunningham, the campaign master of ceremonies,
made ruthlessly clear he was allowing no supplementary questions: a
draconian measure that, nonetheless, made palpable hits well nigh
impossible.
With the Conservatives' two key themes - 'You Can't Trust Labour', and,
ditto, Mr Kinnock - both couched in negatives it should have been clear to
experienced media manipulators that their raw material would run thin over
four weeks. So it has proved.
When the charge of disloyalty to the cause was put to one rat-packer from
the Tory tabloids yesterday, his reply was splenetic. 'What are we meant to
do? We have been attacking Kinnock for eight years, it is as exciting as
cold potato,' he said. 'The fact is Kinnock on the run is yesterday's news.
The Tories on the run is a real story.'
Whatever Labour might say, there is no question that their leader has been
sheltered to some extent from the worst of the press rottweilers. What is
more, there have been more than a few blunders, but luck has repeatedly
seemed to fall the people's party's way.
In the now infamous Jennifer's Ear saga, the high emotion of Mr Kinnock's
press secretary's tearful confession at the microphone was good television
that may actually have worked in Labour's favour. By contrast the same day,
poor Mr William Waldegrave, as innocent as a lamb, appeared to be thrown to
the wolves with not a protective, shepherding Patten or Wakeham in sight.
When the pack smells blood, the wisest course for the wounded is either to
bluff it out - 'A two-point margin will simply dissolve in the privacy of
the voting booth, dear boy' - or to go to ground.
Whingeing does not wash.

FT  07 APR 92 / Election 1992: Jobs top Govan voters' concerns
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UNEMPLOYMENT tops most voters' concerns in Govan, an inner-city district of
Glasgow with a large amount of run-down housing and drug-related crime.
Unemployment is 14.6 per cent, slightly better than elsewhere in Glasgow.
Govan is a marginal in a city of safe Labour seats. Mr Jim Sillars won the
seat for the Scottish National party in a 1988 by-election, overturning a
Labour majority of almost 20,000, shaking Labour out of complacency about
its hold over Glasgow. Mr Ian Davidson, a Strathclyde regional councillor,
is working hard to win the seat back this week. Both parties claim to offer
the best deal on jobs.
Glasgow has a history of sectarianism and Govan has slightly more Protestant
voters than Catholic. Traditionally, Catholic voters incline more towards
Labour than the SNP.
Mr Sillars predicts an increased SNP majority, Labour says it will take the
seat back, and the posters seem evenly divided. This is still a seat to
watch.
THE Church of Scotland yesterday entered the election debate with a strongly
worded attack on the government's social and economic record. The annual
report of the church and nation committee says the human cost of
unemployment is unacceptable and last year's comment by Mr Norman Lamont,
the chancellor, that unemployment was 'a price worth paying' to bring down
inflation, was 'hollow and cynical."

FT  07 APR 92 / Non-conformists test Clinton's stability: Democratic
primaries in New York and the mid-West promise conflicting signals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN, US Editor
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
IT IS perfectly possible to construct the historically correct argument
that, as often as not, the primary elections in the two largest states in
the union, California and New York, do not matter in the choice of a
presidential nominee for the Democratic party.
California's problem is that it votes last, by which time presidential
nominations are usually sewn up. So, in preferring Brown to Carter in 1976,
Kennedy to Carter four years later and Hart over Mondale in 1984, it was
merely bolting the stable door too late.
New York's problem is that it is sui generis, delighting mostly in giving
whoever is the front-runner, especially if from the south, a necessary
come-uppance. It has only held a true preference primary since 1980, when it
went for Kennedy not Carter. In 1988, however, it gave Dukakis, then barely
the favourite, the lift he sorely needed.
Wisconsin, rather neglected this time because of the concentration on New
York, is also a state with a history of non-conformism. It went for McCarthy
in 1968 (though President Johnson had already withdrawn and no one else
serious was on the ballot), McGovern in 1972, Carter by a fraction in 1976
but convincingly in 1980, and Hart four years later.
Many of these facts, and more, may be recited tonight by his spin doctors if
Governor Bill Clinton of Arkansas does not win the New York primary with a
bit to spare. A victory in New York would at least offset a failure in
Wisconsin, where Mr Clinton himself has sensed vulnerability.
A defeat, however, would set more cats among his pigeons. Even though, in
both states and the smaller Kansas primary, he will get a good chunk of
delegates, it will make all the more difficult to win enough by California
and New Jersey on June 2 to assure a first ballot nomination. As it is,
before today's vote he needed to win 57 per cent of all those remaining to
be determined to reach the prize.
This remains still a Clinton-Brown contest, though Paul Tsongas, who may get
some votes and delegates in New York, drops hints he might get back in the
race again, and Governor Mario Cuomo of New York never ceases to muddy the
waters with his delphic utterances.
Serious alternatives to Mr Clinton and Mr Brown do not seem to exist at
present. As R W Apple, dean of the New York Times political staff, wrote on
March 29: 'There are only four options now - Mr Clinton, Mr Brown, a late
starting candidate or a brokered convention. Of the four, the nomination of
Mr Brown, unlikely as the thought may seem, is certainly no less likely than
alternatives three and four.'
A serious collapse by Mr Clinton, however, might increase the chances of the
brokered convention. Here a decisive role could be played by the 722
so-called 'super delegates', in effect party big-wigs who will go to Madison
Square Garden in July in theory uncommitted (though some have already come
out for Mr Clinton).
This might conceivably winkle out of hiding the likes of New Jersey Senator
Bill Bradley, House majority leader Richard Gephardt, Tennessee Senator Al
Gore or West Virginia Senator Jay Rockefeller, not to mention Mr Tsongas and
Mr Cuomo.
But the last approximation of a brokered convention was in 1968, a truly
extraordinary year, and there is no sign that any of the above not now
running will want to be pawns in an end game likely to lead to a thrashing
in November.
If Mr Clinton does survive New York, where his campaign seemed to have
stabilised around the middle of last week, and if the Brown insurgency
begins to falter, as it began to under the glare of scrutiny, then the game
will be back to where it was after Illinois and Michigan voted on March 17.
There will be a presumptive nominee about whom many doubts persist but who
is not so far behind George Bush as to be devoid of hope. And there will
still be a very long way to go.

FT  07 APR 92 / Europeans, Japan seek larger IADB shareholding
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
JAPAN and European governments have begun efforts to enlarge their
shareholding in the Inter-American Development Bank. Japan's contribution to
the bank's operations justified a bigger shareholding, according to a
Japanese Finance Ministry official. Japan has also been seeking to have
Japanese personnel play a bigger role in the bank.
Some European officials, including one from Germany, have also been seeking
a larger shareholding.
Member governments from outside the Americas currently hold only 7.2 per
cent of the capital, and some would like to see this doubled.
As informal discussions start about a new capital increase for the bank,
German officials said they favoured an increase. However, a smaller increase
than the Dollars 40bn (Pounds 23.2bn) proposed by some Latin governments
would be sufficient for the bank to maintain its real lending levels, they
said.
The bank was dealt a blow ahead of its annual meeting by the refusal of the
US Congress last Thursday to fund new foreign aid programmes. But Mr Enrique
Iglesias, the IADB president, said he remained hopeful that such finance
would eventually be forthcoming.
Included in the bill was the initial US contribution for the Dollars 1.5bn
Multilateral Investment Fund (MIF), and relief on debt owed by several Latin
American states to the US government. Both formed part of President George
Bush's Enterprise for the Americas initiative.
The IADB would administer the fund, for which Dollars 1.2bn had been
committed. Japan has agreed to match the US proposed contribution of Dollars
500m, but is believed unlikely to provide support in the absence of US
funding.
Mr Iglesias said his optimism was based on the continued support of the US
administration for the initiative.

FT  07 APR 92 / Hopes rise for accord on Argentine debt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   BUENOS AIRES
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
HOPES were high yesterday that the Argentine government could reach imminent
agreement with leading commercial bank creditors on a plan aimed at reducing
and restructuring the country's foreign bank debt. However, yesterday
morning differences remained between the two sides that could yet delay a
deal.
There were hopes among Argentine officials and the banks, led by Citicorp of
the US, that an agreement in principle could be announced with fanfare at
the annual meeting of the Inter-American Development Bank in Santo Domingo
which formally ends tomorrow. The Argentine delegation is led by Mr Domingo
Cavallo, finance minister.
A number of European banks and one Canadian bank remained unhappy yesterday
about certain aspects of the accord which other leading banks believed
acceptable.
One central difference between the two sides was how much of the Dollars 8bn
of interest arrears the government should pay immediately. Some banks are
holding out for Dollars 900m in cash, while the Argentines have said they
will pay immediately only Dollars 400m in cash and the rest in Argentine
bonds backed by US Treasury paper, to the value of Dollars 400m. Some banks
are questioning why this cannot all be paid in cash. The sum not paid
straightaway will be paid in Argentine bonds.
Other differences include the interest rate on the so-called par bonds which
pay pre-determined interest rates.
While no specific agreement has been on the rate of discount on the
floating-rate bonds to be offered banks in exchange for their loans, the
accord seems likely to settle on a 35 per cent level.
Apart from the Dollars 8bn of arrears, about Dollars 24bn of medium-term
bank debt will be covered by the agreement. The deal, under the debt relief
plan named after Mr Nicholas Brady, US Treasury Secretary, is being
supported by loans to Argentina from the IMF and other institutions.
This finance provides guarantees for the concessional bonds which Argentina
will issue to banks in exchange for their debt.
Hopes that Brazil would also secure an agreement in principle with banks at
Santo Domingo were abandoned last week when a temporary suspension of talks
was announced. Brazilian officials had apparently considered such a deadline
would unduly pressurise them.
Inflation in Argentina rose by 2.1 per cent in March, the government has
reported, writes John Barham in Buenos Aires.
Although lower than expected, inflation remains stubbornly resistant to the
country's rigidly orthodox monetary and fiscal policies.
Last month's increase was a fraction lower than February's 2.2 per cent
rise, and far less than the 11 per cent increase in March 1991. However,
prices have risen by 30.2 per cent over the past 12 months despite a fixed
exchange rate.

FT  07 APR 92 / Close race forecast in serious Wisconsin
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM

<DATELINE>
   MILWAUKEE
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
WISCONSIN'S primary today may prove a closer contest than New York's for the
two remaining contenders for the Democratic presidential nomination,
Governor Bill Clinton of Arkansas and former Governor Jerry Brown of
California.
Mr Brown held an early advantage, gaining from some early visits to the
state while Mr Clinton was still concentrating money and time on New York.
Local opinion polls, however, have produced wide variations: a poll from St
Norbert College Survey Center, in Green Bay, showed Mr Clinton ahead with 44
per cent of the vote, to 33 per cent for Mr Brown, but a later sampling by
Mason-Dixon, a Washington-based research group, reversed this picture, with
46 per cent for Mr Brown and 37 per cent for Mr Clinton.
Private polling by the two campaigns suggest the ballot could be very close
and both candidates took quick breaks from New York to campaign in Wisconsin
on Friday. Mr Clinton left his wife, Hillary, behind to represent him at a
state Democratic party dinner, while Mr Brown's 83-year-old mother, Bernice,
flew in to help her son.
Wisconsin has played a critical role in many presidential elections. In
1944, it killed off the candidacy of Mr Wendell Wilkie and, in 1976, it
helped Mr Jimmy Carter head off the challenge of Mr Morris Udall. But
Wisconsin is also unusual political territory, drawing on its Germanic roots
to devise its own brand of activist and scrupulously honest politics, a
brand which found its expression in Mr Robert LaFollette, who was elected
governor in 1900 and then went on to the Senate before running for president
in 1924.
'What makes Wisconsin a little bit unusual is its old progressive populist
tradition, which has always appreciated the renegade outsider who wants to
run against the system. Clean politics, clean government, that has always
been a tradition here,' says Professor John Johannes of Marquette
University, in Milwaukee. This tradition ought to benefit Mr Brown, but
Wisconsin has also often helped somewhat more conservative Democratic
candidates. It favoured Mr John Kennedy over the more liberal Mr Hubert
Humphrey in 1960, and Mr Michael Dukakis over the Rev Jesse Jackson in 1988.
Wisconsin has also elected, in the person of Governor Tommy Thompson,
perhaps the most activist Republican governor in the country, and appears to
have swung behind his often controversial experiments in welfare reform.
As in so many states previously, Mr Clinton has assured himself of the
backing of most of Wisconsin's Democratic hierarchy, from the chairman of
the state party, Mr Jeffrey Neubauer - who describes Mr Brown as 'a
charlatan' - to former Senators William Proxmire and Gaylord Nelson.
Clinton campaign managers in Milwaukee also say they have received a
substantial boost from Senator Tom Harkin from the neighbouring state of
Iowa, who threw his weight behind Mr Clinton after abandoning his own
candidacy. But Mr Brown has become skilled at the political ju-jitsu of
turning his rival's strengths to his own advantage, by depicting such
endorsements as proof that Mr Clinton is the candidate of the status quo.
Neither candidate, however, has captured Wisconsin's imagination, and their
duel has aroused far less passion than the concurrent elections for mayor of
Milwaukee and judge of the county court.
Nor have Mr Brown or Mr Clinton overcome the widespread distrust of
politicians that has marked this election year.
'We have our politicians and we have our murderers. They're all together,
same difference,' said a waitress at Schuster's Family Restaurant in
Milwaukee.
She knows something about both species, for she counted among her regular
customers, until he was elected senator and went off to Washington, Mr Herb
Kohl, owner of a Wisconsin supermarket chain and of Milwaukee's less than
spectacular basketball team; and also Mr Jeffrey Dahmer, until he went to
prison for at least 17 grisly murders - one of them Schuster's third-shift
cook.
Wisconsin boasts one of the most active and serious electorates in the
country. Turnout is typically 10 to 12 percentage points higher than the
national average, and even in primaries voters have tended to favour
electable candidates, rather than using their votes to send a general
message of discontent.
This time, however, the protest vote could be a factor to be reckoned with.
'Voters are resigned to the fact that Clinton is going to win the nomination
so they can afford to be reckless,' concludes Prof Johannes.

FT  07 APR 92 / World Trade News: GKN establishes foothold in Asean markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GKN, the UK-headquartered components and industrial services group, is
establishing a foothold in the fledgling motor industry of the Association
of South East Asian Nations (Asean), seen as one of the world's main growth
areas for cars and trucks.
It is doing so through a joint venture in Malaysia, from which it expects to
supply constant velocity driveshafts - an essential component of all front
wheel drive cars - to vehicle assemblers throughout the regional grouping.
Asean comprises Malaysia, Indonesia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand
and Brunei.
The venture is small in financial terms, but is seen by GKN as an important
strategic move. It forms part of a matrix of joint ventures set up by GKN
within the past few years, and which are now contributing nearly Pounds 50m
to its annual turnover.
They include ventures in eastern Europe, regarded by GKN as the world's
other main region offering the best prospects for medium-term growth.
GKN's Malaysian partners are Permodalan Nasional Perhad (PNB), a Malaysian
government investment fund, and AAE-Holdings, a Penang-based development
company.
The venture is to be known as Asian Driveshaft and initially, GKN will own
50 per cent, PNB 37.5 and AAE the remainder. However GKN, which is investing
up to Pounds 2m in the company, eventually is to reduce its own holding to
40 per cent with the expected participation of other, non-Malaysian Asean
shareholders. The plant is to begin production in mid-1993.
With the venture, GKN stands to benefit from Malaysian government
legislation requiring the country's current 10 assembly plants, producing a
total of 18 different makes of vehicle, to raise the value of locally made
components
Initially, 'local' content must comprise 30 per cent of the completely
knock-down (CKD) value of the imported kit of parts from which most vehicles
are assembled.
Output is expected to rationalise around Malaysia's own 'national' car
project, Proton, making around 100,000 vehicles a year, and a handful of
Japanese manufacturers. Honda, Toyota and Nissan, the current market
leaders, assemble 7,000-11,000 units each.
The Malaysian market, at just under 200,000 units, is the largest in Asean.
However, the full market potential for GKN lies in the quasi-free-trade
arrangement for motor components being worked out within Asean which would
give it access to the five other Asean states,

FT  07 APR 92 / World Trade News: JVC investigated under Japan's anti-trust
laws
</HEADLINE>

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN's Fair Trade Commission is investigating Victor Corporation of Japan
(JVC) for possible violation of Japan's anti-trust laws.
The case illustrates the growing assertiveness of the FTC in taking on
mainstream Japanese companies and raises fundamental questions about
business practice in Japan.
The case may prove to be a landmark, since it could determine the extent to
which companies which hold patents covering standard electronic formats can
control the sale of products using those formats.
In this case, JVC, which holds patent rights on the widely-used VHS video
format, is alleged to have prevented C&amp;B, a small Japanese computer service
and product development company, from marketing an improved VHS video
recorder which it developed in 1986.
Even if the facts of the case are confirmed, the FTC would be breaking new
legal ground if it concluded that JVC's behaviour constituted an abuse of
its market position and therefore a violation of antitrust law.
JVC yesterday said: 'We fully believe that JVC has never done anything that
infringes the law.' C&amp;B, which stands for computers and business, had
developed an address system for a video recorder that allowed a video
machine to be operated by a computer. It subsequently signed contracts with
NEC Home Electronics and Sharp, which made the machines on an original
equipment manufacturing basis.
After first shipments, however, NEC and Sharp held discussions with JVC and
then stopped production of the machines. Mr Kim Moon-Jae, president of C&amp;B,
says he was told that JVC, as holder of the VHS patent, would not let them
proceed.
JVC confirmed that the case has been investigated by the FTC. It said
however that it was important for JVC to assure compatability of VHS
products.
A spokesman said: 'If many different systems came out perhaps consumers will
be confused. JVC has to watch carefully to see whether it is good for the
consumers.'
Mr Kim said that C&amp;B lost Y5bn (Pounds 21.5m) as a result of having
production of the video recorders halted. Its annual sales have plunged from
Y1.5bn five years ago to Y150m today.
Should the FTC rule against JVC, it would only be able to issue a
cease-and-desist order. In principle, C&amp;B could bring a suit to recover
damages, but this would be difficult in the Japanese courts.
Although the dimensions of the case appear small, the issues have
international implications.

JAPAN HAS invited political and financial personalities from around the

environment, Reuter reports from Tokyo.
The Eminent Persons' Meeting on Financing Global Environment and Development
on April 15-17 will be hosted by Mr Noboru Takeshita, the former prime
minister.
The United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED), which
is staging the Earth Summit in Brazil in June, estimates the global cost of
environmental preservation at Dollars 125bn (Pounds 72bn) a year from 1993
to 2000.
'I thought that acting as host for this meeting and holding it in Tokyo
would demonstrate Japan's intention to play an active role in solving global
environmental problems,' Mr Takeshita said.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SOUTH KOREA'S Hyundai conglomerate came under renewed financial pressure
yesterday when its main creditor bank banned five subsidiaries from making
industrial investments or acquiring property for the next six months.
Meanwhile, the South Korean banking supervisor said it was likely that a
second Hyundai subsidiary would lose its rights to unrestricted credit
access following a similar curb on Hyundai Electronic Industries over the
weekend. Unrestricted credit is an important privilege in a country plagued
by credit shortages.
The actions are linked to a growing conflict between the government and Mr
Chung Ju Yung, the founder of Hyundai. Mr Chung recently created the
Unification National Party (UNP), which captured a pivotal parliamentary
position in last month's National Assembly elections after it campaigned on
an anti-government platform.
Korean Exchange Bank (KEB) said it was imposing the penalties on the five
Hyundai concerns because the companies recently purchased property and built
facilities without its permission. This violates the country's strict credit
control rules.
The companies involved are among Hyundai's most important. They include the
shipbuilder Hyundai Heavy Industries, the car maker Hyundai Motor, Hyundai
Wood Industries, Hyundai Aluminium Industry, and Hyundai Electrical
Engineering.
Hyundai already has claimed that alleged financial restrictions imposed on
the conglomerate by the government in recent months have led to delays in
its investment programme, including the development and production of a new
range of vehicles. The government has denied that Hyundai has been subject
to credit sanctions.
While KEB was disclosing its decision, the Office of Bank Supervision said
that Hyundai Electronics Industries would probably be stripped of its right
to unlimited credit this Friday unless it could disprove charges that it
illegally financed the UNP in the parliamentary elections through bank
loans.

<TEXT>
TEHRAN yesterday accused the west of a 'calculated conspiracy' to disrupt
its elections later this week, after weekend attacks by anti-government
Iranian protesters on Iranian missions overseas.
The attacks by supporters of the Mujahideen Khalq opposition group followed
Sunday's bombing raids by eight Iranian F-4 jets on Mujahideen bases in Iraq
 -the first Iranian air strike against its neighbour since the end of the
1980-88 Gulf war. Iraq has complained to the UN Security Council about the
raids,
France yesterday condemned the raids, saying they risked igniting further
violence in the region. 'Regional peace could be in danger,' said Mr Daniel
Bernard, Foreign Ministry spokesman. He also condemned the subsequent
attacks on Iranian embassies.
Ambassadors from countries in which Iranian embassies were attacked were
summoned to the Foreign Ministry in Tehran yesterday for a strong protest. A
ministry spokesman was quoted as saying that the demonstrators should be
extradited and compensation paid for damage to the missions.
The raid also revived hostile exchanges between the two former belligerents,
with Iran demanding that Iraq cease supporting the Mujahideen. Iraqi
newspapers meanwhile condemned the raid, suggesting that the US lay behind
the bombing.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Taiwanese National Assembly faces a week-long boycott by opposition
delegates as the latest sign of growing discord on the island about whether
to move to a directly elected presidency - a debate which itself is
symptomatic of uncertainty about Taiwan's broader constitutional future.
Opposition deputies walked out yesterday after disrupting a speech by Mr Hau
Pei-tsun, the prime minister, and challenging his right to address the
assembly.
But conservative delegates of the ruling KMT party say they will try to keep
the topic off the National Assembly's agenda altogether in the session which
opened last month, arguing that there are still four years left until the
end of President Lee Teng-Hui's term.
The main opposition Democratic Progressive party (DPP), which holds 75 of
the 403 assembly seats, has already called for island-wide demonstrations on
April 19. The DPP supports a directly elected president, but of an
independent Republic of Taiwan. This is anathema to the KMT government,
which still claims sovereignty over the whole of China, although Taiwan has
operated as an independent state since 1949.
The debate, which is over whether to allow the president to be elected by
the Taiwanese people rather than by electoral college, was apparently
initiated in early March by President Lee himself within the KMT leadership,
and erupted into a public row during the party's central committee plenum.
Until now, the president has been elected by the National Assembly, which is
also charged with amending the constitution, a relic from the days of KMT
rule on the mainland before it fled to Taiwan in 1949 after losing the war
with the communists. Taiwan has a separate parliament, the Legislative Yuan.
Mr Chen Pi-chao, of the independent Institute for National Policy Research,
says that the presidency issue is symptomatic of a power struggle which has
been endemic in the KMT leadership ever since Taiwan-born President Lee, who
is also chairman of the KMT, broke the mainlanders' monopoly on power when
he was elected two years ago.
Ranged on one side are Mr Lee's supporters, the liberal mainstream faction,
most of whom are native Taiwanese and who favour direct presidential
elections. They have public opinion and most regional assemblies behind
them. On the other side is the conservative faction, mostly of mainland
origin, supporters of the prime minister, who has close connections with the
military.
Opinion polls earlier this year showed that a majority of Taiwanese favoured
direct election of the president, if only because it was simpler than other
methods.
Other political analysts are concerned that such an election would bring a
presidential system, in which too much power resides in one person. 'That
kind of system is not conducive to the stability of a developing country,'
says Professor Hu Fu of National Taiwan University. 'It's too easy for it to
turn into a personality cult like the Marcos regime in the Philippines.'
Conservatives in the KMT also argue that direct election of a Taiwanese
president would be a step closer to formal independence, and therefore
unacceptable to Beijing, which has threatened military intervention should
the island declare itself independent.

<TEXT>
JIANG ZEMIN, secretary general of the Chinese Communist party, yesterday
insisted there was consensus in the party in favour of economic reform and
opening to the outside world.
Denying reports of a party split as he left on a five-day visit to Japan,
Jiang said the 15-member politburo was united in supporting the policy of
'one central task and two basic points' - the central task being economic
development and the basic points the Marxist theory used to back up senior
leader Deng Xiaoping's 'socialism with Chinese characteristics'.
There was no need to change the composition of the politburo, Jiang said.
The 3,000-delegate National People's Congress was last week the forum of
unusual discord, and the report to it from Li Peng, the hardline premier,
was substantially amended.
Answering reporters' questions in Beijing, Jiang rejected any prospect of
the party reassessing its verdict on the 'Tiananmen event', the occasion in
June 1989 when soldiers opened fire on peaceful demonstrators in Beijing.
Reuter adds from Tokyo: Japanese Foreign Ministry officials announced that
agreement on a third package of energy loans for China, worth an estimated
Y700bn (Pounds 3.05bn) would be signed within two months.
During 2 1/2 hours of talks, Jiang and Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, Japan's prime
minister, praised progress since 1972 and agreed not to let differences
overshadow common interests. 'But our joint interests greatly outweigh our
points of difference.'

GENERAL Suchinda Kraprayoon, the army commander who led last year's Thai
coup d'etat and vowed he would not accept the premiership, yesterday
appeared likely to be nominated as the country's next prime minister.
However, MPs who oppose the appointment of an unelected prime minister and
command almost half the seats in the lower house were thought to have
officially proposed an alternative.
Gen Suchinda did not stand in the March 22 general election. But he emerged
as the leading candidate after the majority alliance of five parties endured
almost two weeks of strong public opposition to their original proposal to
nominate Mr Narong Wong Wan, leader of the pro-military Samakkhi Tham
(Justice Unity) party, which won the largest number of seats.
Mr Narong was alleged to be associated with heroin trafficking, and the US
government confirmed that it had refused him a visa last year on these
grounds.
He has denied the charges and has not officially given up his candidacy, but
some leaders of the five parties say their alliance had switched support to
Gen Suchinda.
The army chief would not comment yesterday. If he does accept the
premiership he will have to explain why he has decided to break a
categorical denial last year that neither he nor the powerful air force
commander, Air Chief Marshal Kaset Rajananil, would accept the premiership.
'I can reaffirm here that both General Suchinda and Air Chief Marshal Kaset
will not be prime minister after the promulgation of the constitution,' Gen
Suchinda said then.
Much of the press opposes Gen Suchinda, as does a large section of public
opinion in Bangkok, where an anti-military party took all but one of the
seats in the election.
In accepting the premiership Gen Suchinda may also have to let leading
members of the five parties be ministers even though some of them were in
the government that was overthrown and were later proclaimed 'unusually
wealthy'.
Without their support, Gen Suchina would not be able to rule. But their
selection could also be difficult to explain because one of the key
justifications for last year's coup was corruption in the cabinet.

FT  07 APR 92 / Strike begins at Ireland's banks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
STAFF at Ireland's four main clearing banks began a national strike
yesterday after the breakdown of talks at the weekend over longer opening
hours and a 6.5 per cent pay claim.
Irish Bank Officials' Association (IBOA) said 80 per cent of its 13,000
members were supporting the strike, although many branches were working with
skeleton staffs.
The four banks affected are Allied Irish Banks (AIB), Bank of Ireland,
National Irish Bank and Ulster Bank. Between them they account for 56 per
cent of private bank credit in the Irish Republic.
AIB, Ireland's largest bank, claimed that more than half its staff had
turned up for work.
The dispute came to a head at the weekend, after two months of limited
industrial action by the IBOA led the banks to begin sacking staff who
refused to process bank charges.
The four banks have offered a 6 per cent pay rise linked to longer opening
hours, which the IBOA has rejected, despite its recommendation by a Labour
Court mediator. The banks intend to initiate lunchtime opening next month,
and argue that if their workforces do not accept the principle of all-day
opening, the banks will be unable to compete when the last barriers to an
open EC market in financial services are dropped next year.
The IBOA said its pay demand goes back three years, and a settlement on the
introduction of new technology was still outstanding. These had to dealt
with before lunchtime opening could be agreed.

FT  07 APR 92 / EC refuses Irish shift in protocol on abortion
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A MAJORITY of Ireland's partners in the European Community yesterday refused
to allow Dublin to modify its anti-abortion protocol attached to the
Maastricht treaty for fear of opening a Pandora's box of other changes.
Dublin wanted to reconcile its 1983 constitutional ban on abortion with the
sort of case that recently arose when a 14-year-old Irish girl, pregnant
after being raped, was initially denied the right to travel to Britain to
get an abortion, but was later allowed to do so after a Supreme Court
ruling.
Mr David Andrews, foreign minister, suggested Ireland might have to delay
the referendum on the Maastricht treaty planned for June to clarify the
abortion issue.
The insistence by Germany and France yesterday that the Maastricht treaty be
left untouched reflects increasing nervousness that if even one part of the
treaty were unstitched, the rest might fall apart under other demands for
re-negotiation.
Yesterday's move also has implications for Britain's position on the treaty.
The Labour party would want to sign up to the EC social chapter on working
conditions if it wins Thursday's UK election. However, it would now be
difficult for Britain to renegotiate legally the opt-out on social policy.
The only revision open to a Labour government would probably be the sort of
interpretative 'solemn declaration' offered to Ireland yesterday.
In what turned out to be a self-inflicted embarrassment, the Irish
government insisted on adding to the Maastricht treaty a formal protocol,
stating that nothing in the treaty would negate its constitutional ban on
abortion.
However second thoughts set in this year with the case of the 14-year-old.
While finally allowing the girl to get an abortion in Britain, three of the
Irish Supreme Court's five judges said that, in general, the rights of an
unborn child took precedence over the (EC-enshrined) freedom to travel. What
the Irish government was seeking yesterday was to add a sentence to its
protocol, upholding its citizens' right to travel and to receive information
on services legally available elsewhere in the EC.

FT  07 APR 92 / Polish finance supremo tries to fill credibility gap:
Andrzej Olechowski explains his task to Andrew Gowers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW GOWERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR a man in the midst of a political baptism of fire, Mr Andrzej Olechowski
exudes calm and reassurance. He will need both qualities in substantial
measure over the next few weeks. As Poland's new finance minister, in the
job for just six weeks, he faces two formidable and interlinked tasks:
restoring the country's credibility with the international financial
institutions; and persuading its fragmented parliament to accept a budget
plan which curbs government spending.
It is a twin challenge that ultimately defeated Mr Olechowski's two
predecessors: Mr Leszek Balcerowicz, the architect of Poland's shift towards
a market economy who lost the job as a result of last autumn's elections,
and Mr Karol Lutkowski, who resigned over policy disagreements in February.
That Mr Olechowski, a 44-year-old former trade official who once worked for
the World Bank in Washington, succeeds is vital at a time of increasing
worries in the west about the country's ability to sustain the momentum of
reform in the face of a deep recession.
Mr Olechowski - who looks like the archetypal Polish cavalryman, tall,
silver-haired with a bushy moustache - is in no doubt about the scale of the
difficulties. 'We are not credible domestically or internationally, and we
are aware of that,' he cheerily admits. 'Credibility can only be
re-established by acts, not words.'
He has already made a start. Six weeks ago the government was in open
disarray over economic policy; today Mr Olechowski insists that other
ministers are in complete accord with him, and the others - notably Mr Jerzy
Eysymontt, the planning minister who had been rumoured to be at odds with
the previous finance minister - do not disagree.
The result is a perceptible improvement both in the government's command
over its own finances and in its relations with the outside world. Back in
February, the budget deficit seemed to be out of control, the international
financial institutions were hovering anxiously in the background, and the
World Bank was warning in a report circulated to ministers that there was an
'imminent danger' of hyperinflation unless the government reasserted its
grip. Since then, Mr Olechowski has re-established a dialogue with the
International Monetary Fund, persuaded the government to accept a budget
that will enable negotiations to proceed on a new IMF agreement, and drawn
up plans for a rationalisation of state-owned industry and financial system.
Now he has embarked on the hard part: an effort to cajole the Sejm, Poland's
politically fragmented parliament, into agreeing to the budget - which
provides for a deficit of 65 trillion (million million) zlotys (Pounds
2.8bn), equivalent to 5 per cent of gross domestic product - and to the
complex legal changes necessary to implement it.  Parliamentary debate on
the budget has just begun, and it is far from certain that the vote in a few
weeks' time will be positive. Without approval, the government's credibility
will be again in shreds, the worries about hyperinflation will resurface,
and Poland's prospects of significant financial assistance from west will
fade.
Even with budget approval, Mr Olechowski knows he will be walking a
tightrope. Poland is, he says, already experiencing capital flight to the
tune of tens of millions of dollars a month, and he is worried that this
figure will grow. If the government's hopes for zero growth in gross
domestic product - after sharp falls in 1990 and 1991 - fail to materialise;
if growth in wages is not restrained; if Poland fails to secure the external
assistance he says it needs to finance the budget deficit - then the alarm
bells will sound again.
Mr Olechowski's sober approach shows how far the government of the prime
minister, Mr Jan Olszewski, has had to change tack since it was first formed
last December, promising to get the economy moving again. In effect, he is
implementing exactly the same policies that made the last government so
unpopular. This time, however, supporters of reform within and outside the
country hope Mr Olechowski will succeed where the somewhat remote
personality of Mr Balcerowicz failed in communicating the need for realism.
Mr Olechowski plans to be less dogmatic than Mr Balcerowicz on the zloty
exchange rate. He says that if another 'relatively small' devaluation of the
zloty (the currency was devalued by 12 per cent last month) is necessary to
maintain Poland's competitive edge, that is what he will undertake.
Here too, however, he is constrained by the need to fight inflation, which
was 70 per cent last year.
Beyond the current difficulties with the budget, Mr Olechowski is anxious to
keep the structural reforms initiated by his predecessors, such as changes
to the tax system, on track: VAT is to come in at the beginning of next
year.

FT  07 APR 92 / Chaos grips Sarajevo as snipers fire on protesters
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By A Special Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CHAOS gripped central Sarajevo in the central Yugoslav republic of
Bosnia-Hercegovina yesterday as street battles raged and as snipers fired on
peace demonstrators. The snipers killed at least five protesters and wounded
dozens, according to one report.
Serb guerrillas fought street battles and artillery duels with police and
volunteer units loyal to Moslem and Croat leaders.
The snipers, thought to be Serbs, fired on tens of thousands of peace
demonstrators gathered outside parliament. The demonstrators were demanding
an end to the fighting, the sacking of the republic's nationalist-coalition
government and new elections.
'We came here as peacemakers,' one demonstrator told a Sarajevo television
reporter. 'If we came to fight, we would have brought our weapons. Now we
have nothing but our bare hands.'
Mr Alija Izetbegovic, Bosnia-Hercegovina's president, claims that the
bloodshed is the result of a concerted effort by Serbs to seize territory,
destabilise the republic and thwart its recognition as an independent state.
Serious ethnic clashes in Bosnia-Hercegovina have increased since voters
overwhelmingly passed a referendum on independence last month. Serb voters,
however, boycotted the vote. The Serbs, who account for 32 per cent of
Bosnia-Hercegovina's 4.3m people, oppose being cut off from Serbia by an
international frontier. Their leaders have warned for over a year that such
a step would lead to civil war. They now advocate breaking the republic into
ethnic cantons. The Serbs claim 60 per cent of the republic's territory.
The republic's ethnic Yugoslavs, Moslems and many Croats support
independence and maintaining the republic's territorial integrity because
they are loath to be linked with what is certain to be a Serb-dominated rump
Yugoslav state.
Exploding mortar shells fell yesterday on Sarajevo's historic, mainly
Moslem-populated bazaar area and outlying areas east of the capital. People
around the city of 700,000 braved sniper fire to watch artillery shells
exploding in the mountains above.
Several thousand demonstrators stormed the Holiday Inn hotel, breaking
windows and searching for gunmen. Hand grenades exploded inside the
building, which Serb militiamen have been using as a base.
At least nine people have died and about hundred wounded in fighting in
Sarajevo since the violence began early on Sunday morning, local news
reports and doctors said. It is the worst fighting in Bosnia-Hercogovina
since World War II. Ironically, yesterday was the anniversary of Sarajevo's
liberation in 1945 from Nazi occupation forces.
The republic's interior minister, Mr Alija Delimustafic, yesterday
repeatedly called on the Yugoslav army to intervene on the side of the
'citizenry' to stop the bloodshed. The army's loyalties remain unclear
despite almost two days of constant fighting around the city.
Yugoslav army infantry units backed by tanks this morning guarded Sarajevo's
airport.
Mortar shells reportedly rained down on the main television transmission
tower above the city and television announcers said they feared the station
would come under attack.

FT  07 APR 92 / EC to recognise Bosnia and lift Serbia sanctions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   LUXEMBOURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Community yesterday decided to recognise Bosnia's independence
and conditionally ended trade sanctions against Serbia, in a twin move
designed to underline even-handed EC mediation.
The Twelve will delay until today their diplomatic recognition of Bosnia, so
that the US can join in the move. Washington is also now likely to recognise
Croatia and Slovenia, as the EC did in mid-January.
Mr Joao de Deus Pinheiro, foreign minister of Portugal which holds the EC
presidency, reported a consensus among his EC counterparts that 'we should
not give arguments (by withholding recognition) to radicals who are against
independence'.
He was largely referring to the Serb third of Bosnia's 4.5m population who
boycotted last month's referendum, in which a very large majority among
Bosnia's Moslems and Croats voted for independence.
Recognising Bosnia should, on balance, reduce the scope for interference
from neighbouring Serbia and pacify majority Moslem-Croat sentiment in the
violence-torn republic, EC ministers hope.
At the same time, the Twelve reached a classic compromise on Serbian
sanctions. Mr Pinheiro said the Belgrade government of President Slobodan
Milosevic had proved 'much more constructive' towards EC-sponsored peace
efforts recently. The EC will therefore restore to Serbia the EC tariff and
quota preferences which the five other republics got back at the turn of
this year, as France and Greece, Belgrade's main sympathisers within the EC,
have urged.
But to ease the deep distrust of Serbia and the Serb-led federal army,
notably in Germany, the EC has set pre-conditions. These are that Serbia
endorse the principle of the EC peace conference on non-violability of
frontiers; open airspace over Croatia and Slovenia to flights by the United
Nations peace-keeping force and others; and repeal Serbian legislation
purporting to apply to Serb enclaves in Croatia. Serbia has only come close
to fulfilling the first of these conditions.
The briefing of Lord Carrington, chairman of the Yugoslav peace conference,
to ministers yesterday was instrumental to both decisions. While he opposed
the German-led recognition of Croatia three months ago as undermining his
peace efforts, Lord Carrington told ministers that such was the instability
in Bosnia that there was nothing to be gained from further delay in putting
last month's referendum verdict into effect.
Macedonia's quest for recognition is still stuck on the nomenclature dispute
with Greece. Mr Pinheiro said he hoped soon to be able to announce a formula
easing Greece's worries about recognising Macedonia under that name.
Lobbying for Macedonia yesterday in the corridors of the Luxembourg council
building was Mr Robert Macfarlane, President Reagan's national security
adviser who resigned over the Iran-Contra affair. He said that Macedonia,
whose name in itself hardly constituted claims on Greece, was ready to sign
non-aggression pacts with its neighbours, once it was independent and able
to do so.

THE Russian parliament has forced other republics to decide on a carve-up of
the armed forces of the Commonwealth of Independent States, at present under
Russian control.
A statement agreed at the weekend by the praesidium of the Russian
parliament said the new Russian army would take over all the present CIS
forces, even those based in non-Russian republics.
Russia pays for all the former Soviet armed forces except those taken over
by Ukraine and Moldova. The praesidium's decision will force the other
republics to decide what proportion of forces based on their territory they
wish to take on and pay for.
General Pavel Grachev, named on Friday as one of the two deputy Russian
defence ministers, said the government wanted the Russian army to number
between 1.2m and 1.3m, out of the 3m former Soviet troops.
Deputies say the praesidium decision also means that the strategic nuclear
forces, currently under CIS command, would also be put under Russian
control.
The republics of Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Belorussia still have substantial
strategic forces on their territory, none of which have so far been returned
to Russia - though all have pledged to do so.
The deputies say that Russia will attempt to conclude a treaty with the
other CIS members on the provision of a 'nuclear umbrella' once the
strategic forces have been secured.

FT  07 APR 92 / Survey of The Computer Industry (12): 'I'm having a great
time' - Profile: Michael Dell, an irrepressible entrepreneur who has
confounded the sceptics and helped to reshape the PC industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TEN YEARS ago, probably few people outside his home town of Houston, Texas,
had heard of a teenaged marketing and technical whiz kid called Michael
Dell. International Business Machines, and other personal computer
manufacturers such as Compaq, no doubt wish it had stayed that way.
In the eight years since he founded his own computer company at the age of
19, Dell Computer Corporation has taken on 'Big Blue' and the computer
industry establishment - and won significant victories.
Michael Dell, a quietly-spoken, self-confident 27-year-old with an
irrepressible entrepreneurial drive, who says he is having 'a great time'
and can't imagine doing anything else, has consistently confounded all the
sceptics.
Since its beginnings in a college room at the University of Texas in Austin,
his company has grown into a Dollars 1bn-a-year multinational which has
re-written the rules of the PC marketing business.
Direct sales, innovative marketing techniques and tight manufacturing
controls have enabled Dell to under-price its competitors, while still
delivering quality products and award-winning service to its customers - and
solid profits to its shareholders.
Success seems to come naturally to Michael Dell. When he was 12, he
organised a national mail-order stamp auction business from the family home
in Houston and made a Dollars 2,000 profit. Five years later, while still at
high school, he displayed his marketing flair by thinking up novel ways to
sell newspaper subscriptions. That initiative won him top honours as a sales
representative for the Houston Post and earned him Dollars 18,000 in one
year, working just two days a week.
Meanwhile, he was indulging his real passion, fiddling with 'electronics
kits, motors and anything with moving parts'. His first computer was an
Apple II, followed by an IBM PC, and even before starting university he had
won several computer programming awards and developed and sold a software
copy-protection technique.
At university he studied medicine 'because of parental pressure' - his elder
brother and father are doctors. But Michael Dell and medicine did not get
on. Looking back, he says with a smile that he is glad he is not a doctor
because, 'the failure rate is too high in medicine - I like th. e more
positive reinforcement of the customer being happy'
During his first year at college he identified the opportunity for
redefining the PC distribution chain by cutting out dealers and their high
mark-ups and selling computers direct to end-users.
From his college room he began by buying local computer dealers excess
inventory, souping-up the machines and selling them on at a discount through
newspaper advertisements. The business boomed and, in spite of parental
disapproval, he quit college after his first year and set up his own
company. With the exception of 1988, which Michael Dell admits was 'a
difficult year' - and one quarter in particular when the company just
managed to stay in the black with a Dollars 100,000 profit - sales and
profits have risen steadily.
In its latest financial year, while many other computer companies have been
badly hit by the recession and cut-throat competition, Dell reported net
income up 87 per cent at Dollars 50.9m on sales up 63 per cent at Dollars
889.9m. Over the past five years, Dell's average annual sales growth has
been an astonishing 67 per cent and Michael Dell says proudly, 'we are not
slowing down'.
In the early days, most of Dell's sales went to computer enthusiasts, but
now about half of its US sales go to Fortune 1000 companies and government
departments. The company also has a growing overseas business, particularly
in Europe, where it has set up a manufacturing plant in low-tax Ireland.
Michael Dell, who is chairman and chief executive, says the basic drivers
for competitiveness in the PC business are 'material costs, operating
expense and tax rates', coupled with a willingness, and ability, to take
risks.
For example, while most companies carry about 14 weeks' supply of parts,
Dell has shaved costs by cutting its parts inventory to 8.1 weeks.
Similarly, Dell carries no inventory of finished machines, and since there
are no dealers, there are no dealer inventories gathering dust and becoming
obsolete. Every Dell computer is built to a customer's requirements and
normally the order is delivered within five days.
But probably the most important key to the company's success is its emphasis
not only on price, but on listening and responding quickly to customers. 'If
all you have is price you can attract a buyer once, but you won't retain
that buyer,' says Michael Dell.
Instead, Dell has evolved what it calls a 'direct working relationship' with
customers.
Dell takes 25,000 phone-calls worldwide a day. If a caller is one an
existing customer, details of their equipment is stored a keyboard-stroke
away on a database containing more than 750,000 names and addresses.
The company pioneered unlimited telephone support for the lifetime of a
product via a toll-free telephone 'hotline', and believes an engineer can
solve 90 per cent of customer problems over the telephone.
There are important spin-offs from this close customer relationship. It
enables Dell to respond quickly to changes in tastes or requirements. For
example, some customers said wanted the power of a machine built around an
Intel 486 chip, but not in a big case. So Dell built a 486 in a small
desktop unit. Other customers complained it was difficult to reach cards
inside big tower systems on the floor under desks. So Dell put wheels on the
boxes and made cards accessible from the top.
In another customer -led
move, Dell offered to ship systems fully loaded with applications software,
if required. This can save a corporate customer buying, say, 100 machines,
hours of time loading the software manually.
Because Dell designs and builds its own machines it is able to react quickly
to technological developments and can design, test and begin volume
shipments of a new desktop machine within five months.
'It is important to remain on the leading edge of technology for a couple of
reasons,' says Michael Dell.
'First, our customers absolutely require it - if you look at our
product-line, our oldest product is 11 months old and more than half our
sales come from products that were introduced in the last couple of months.
Second, we are in a business that moves very quickly and speed can be a big
advantage.'
Listening to Michael Dell explain how he runs his company, it is difficult
to believe he has had no formal management training, although he emphasises
he does not hesitate to borrow a good idea. Somehow it seems almost
instinctive to him.
To stay in touch with 3,000 employees, he uses the internal electronic mail
system, his car phone and pays frequent visits to the factory floor - and to
overseas offices.
His colleagues say he is always willing to listen and learn, and does not
try to force his own views. Martin Slagter, Dell's vice-president in charge
of European marketing and operations, adds: 'Michael is very non-precious of
history; he has no qualms about hanging on to what happened even three
months ago.'
Like the company that bears his name, Michael Dell retains the energy and
flexibility of youth. But these days he has cut back on the workaholic hours
he once kept, to spend time with his wife, Susan, and three-month old
daughter, Kira Elizabeth.
Two things he has not given up are his delight in the latest electronic
gizmo - he usually acts as the first tester for new Dell products - or of
things that are smartly and efficiently designed such as his Honda Acura
NSX, which he says is better than the Porsche 928 he used to drive.
Dell Computer has helped reshape the PC industry, but can it keep up the
pace?
Michael Dell insists it can, provided the company remembers 'that
customer-service is not a steady state thing - you have to always improve
it, you have to keep changing.'
As for his own future, he can't think of anything he would rather be. 'This
is a tremendous amount of fun, and I'm having a great time,' he says.
'The real challenge was always Dell versus IBM - David versus Goliath. And
it is still that.'

It lost Dollars 554m in 1989, Dollars 337m in 1990 and a staggering Dollars
1.2bn in 1991 on revenues 14 per cent down at Dollars 8.7bn. In the fourth
quarter of 1991, however, it returned a net profit of Dollars 80m and
expects again to be profitable in the first quarter of the current year.
While its top executives argue the worst is now behind it, Unisys remains
among the walking wounded with a burden of debt which is now close to
Dollars 3bn and an unacceptably high cost-structure. Its future prospects
are tied too closely to the uncertainties of the global economy for the
liking of Mr James Unruh, chief executive officer since 1990.
'We need,' he says, 'the economy to improve. We need healthier customers'.
Unruh is an accountant by training but he has spent his working life in
electronics and computer businesses. He has had a rough ride since taking
over from Mr Michael Blumenthal, a former Treasury Secretary, whose vision
was the stimulus for the formation of Unisys.
'I am beginning to think this is normal,' Mr Unruh says wryly of the
profound measures he has had to take to restructure the company and stem the
flood of cash leaking from its balance sheet.
Unisys was formed in 1986 from Sperry and Burroughs, two struggling,
medium-sized computer manufacturers. The idea was to create a group of a
size to challenge the dominance of IBM. There were worries at the time, in
retrospect richly justified, that the new company would have difficulties in
maintaining two separate mainframe product lines and merging two corporate
cultures.
It might just have been possible to brush these difficulties under the
carpet if the industry had maintained its traditional growth rate of more
than 20 per cent a year. Instead, industry growth slowed sharply with the
onset of global recession and Unisys was hit by a number of adverse factors
simultaneously.
Its principal competitors, notably IBM and Digital Equipment, were affected
by the same problems, but they did not have the disadvantage of a company
merger to contend with at the same time.
The principal factors were: improvements in technology which cut the cost of
computing hardware, the growth of open systems which damaged sales of
proprietary hardware and, as Mr Unruh told security analysts last month, a
resistance among customer to further investment in computing - 'growth has
slowed because customers are not able to absorb new technology at today's
rate of technological change.'
Quoting the Harvard Business Review, Mr Unruh argued: 'Computers have become
too powerful for the uses to which they are being put.'
The measures Mr Unruh and his senior management team put in place include:
A commitment to move from proprietary computer designs to open systems. It
has, for example, signed an agreement with Intel, the US semiconductor
company whose microprocessors are at the heart of most of the world's
personal computers. It has also concluded an agreement with Motorola for
mainframe computer chips.
The company will, of course, continue to supply its customers with the
mainframe computers which provide the bulk of its revenues and profits. It
is working hard to increase incompatibility between the Burroughs line and
the Sperry line and so increase economies of scale and reduce research and
development commitments. Mr Unruh believes that the hardware is already
about 70 per cent commonality between the two lines.
A new emphasis on solving customers' problems through a change from
geographically focused marketing to a line of business approach. The company
has decided to focus on four strategic markets - financial services,
airlines and travel, communications and the government sector.
'These areas already account for more than 70 per cent of our commercial
computer business,' Mr Unruh says. 'We have the skills, knowledge,
relationships and, in many areas, the solutions.'
Unisys computers are used by 140 airlines, the company is number two in
wholesale and retail banking and its systems handle half the world's
cheques.
A large reduction in staff numbers and substantial operational streamlining,
costing about Dollars 1.2bn in restructuring charges. Some seven
manufacturing plans have been closed in the past 18 months and 20,000 items
removed from the product catalogue. Since the middle of last year, headcount
has been reduced by 8,600 while expenses in the fourth quarter were 21 per
cent lower than the same period the year before.
The establishment of 'turnaround teams' to manage the company's assets. The
idea was to generate additional cash flow from the balance sheet by selling
off assets that were no longer central to the company's operations and
managing working capital better.
Fourteen turnaround teams were created, involving more than 200 Unisys staff
working with an outside specialists. Each team was concerned with a specific
area of the company's activities. The result was the delivery of about
Dollars 1bn in 1991.
Now the company intends to use the same technique to re-seekout cash
opportunities in areas ranging from gross profit margin improvement to
trimming administrative support - taking unnecessary work out of the
company, as Mr George Robson, the company's chief financial officer, puts
it.
Not all the measures have been successful. Mr Unruh failed in November last
year to sell Paramax, a subsidiary specialising in defence electronics.
The gain hoped for was Dollars 700m; in the event, the sale was cancelled.
'The marketplace,' Mr Unruh said, 'simply did not put a reasonable value on
the business.'
He says that outstanding progress was made in 1991. There has been a nearly
40 per cent improvement in net debt. From a peak of Dollars 4bn in 1989, it
is now down to about Dollars 2.5bn. Inventories have been reduced to the
lowest level since the company was formed and inventory turns are now 4.6
times a year compared with 2.6 times three years ago. The cash position at
the end of 1991 was more than Dollars 800m.
The measures Unisys' senior management have instituted have clearly improved
the company's position greatly, yet its health remains delicate in an
unfavourable environment.
Debt could be reduced to manageable levels in two to three years if economic
conditions do not worsen. However, Mr Unruh says that he sees no sign of the
upturn that could accelerate the company's recovery.

FT  07 APR 92 / Survey of The Computer Industry (9): A buzzword chasing a
trend - Client-server computing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN WHYBROW
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BUZZWORDS plague the computer industry. They come, they go, they confuse.
'Client-server' is no exception. It means many things to many people and
trips off the tongues of suppliers with ease. However, at least in this case
it seems to be a buzzword chasing a trend, rather than the other way around.
That in itself suggests it is probably being driven by users.
The concept is simple. A client computer sends a request over a network to a
server computer which then carries out the task.
Typically, the client will be a desktop personal computer and the server
will be a mainframe or minicomputer, although it might just as easily be
another workstation.
The end-users at the client machines should not need to trouble themselves
over the location of the server. The server might be on the next desk, it
might be on a different continent.
Basic client-server computing has been around for years but its potential
has grown rapidly with the arrival of more robust networks, more
sophisticated user interfaces and the ever greater quantities of power
available on the desktop.
An early and obvious example of client-server computing is the print server
which enables a network of PCs to share one or more printers, rather than
each PC having a dedicated printer of its own. A message is sent from the PC
to the server and it prints the document. Benefit: fewer printers, less
cost.
Client-server computing allows the processing to be done where it is most
suited and is similar in aim to the closely related distributed database and
co-operative processing (holding data and running an application
respectively across different platforms).
'To get client-server computing to work, you need good front-end software
(typically a windows user interface), connectivity software such as
LANmanager, and good back-end server applications,' says Mr Phil Buggins,
networking division manager at Microsoft.
The main thing that users really want to know about client-server computing
is, of course: 'Why bother?'
It is a valid question because adapting a client-server strategy can mean a
fair bit of bother. Clearly, things become more complex. What could be more
simple (or more secure) than having application, data and user interface on
the same machine? As soon as you take one or more of these elements off the
one computer, then complications arise.
Take the simple printer/PC example. If each PC has its own printer, then
there is no need to worry about print calls, queueing or about local or wide
area networks.
If not thought-out properly, then even this basic set-up can bring problems.
If there are too few printers, then users can find themselves having to wait
ages for their print-out.
If the printer is some distance away, then regular users might find they
spend a lot of time going to and fro.
If the client and server run under different operating systems, then users
are likely to experience the age-old problems of standards and
inter-operability. In addition, as hardware and software applications
multiply, then so too do selection and support headaches.
As client-server computing evolves, it is not going to become any less
complicated. There is, for instance, the potential for clients to also act
as servers and vice versa. There will also be a growing role for
object-oriented programming (which, as OOPs, is surely vying only with IBM's
Statement Of Direction for the title of silliest acronym in the computer
industry).
OOPs will have a role to play as client-server computing moves more towards
true reusable software. Application will be split into standard processes
(objects), residing in different locations and called as, and when,
required.
So far, there are few off-the-shelf products which take advantage of
client-server computing. Lotus Notes is an early example of an application
which incorporates elements of client-server computing.
Dubbed 'groupware,' it sits on top of the desktop operating system and
allows users to share and jointly work on information across a network, as
well as providing a development environment to enable users to built
application based on the reusable services within Notes. Lotus has teamed up
with IBM to incorporate Notes within the latter's office automation
environment, Officevision.
Tools for building client-server based applications are also thin on the
ground. Those that are around tend to stem from small, niche suppliers or
database and fourth generation language suppliers.
Computer Power's Today client-server application development environment is
one example. There is also something called 'middleware' (those buzzwords
again) which seeks to tie together user interfaces, operating systems,
applications and databases. Techgnosis's Sequelink is an example of this,
supporting a range of client and server environments, network protocols and
databases.
Do the benefits of client-server computing outweigh the hassles?
In a lot of cases the answer is yes, and many larger companies in particular
are among the converts.
Mr Buggins believes that as many as 70 per cent of corporations have started
to implement elements of client-server computing. A big benefit is the
cost-saving associated with doing processing on smaller machines.
The performance of top-end workstations can match that of low-end mainframes
today for a fraction of the cost, and there is no sign of the huge leaps in
desktop performance ending.
It is also potentially easier and cheaper to change the separate elements of
a distributed environment. The systems are much more scalable: if you need
power, add another server. But more than this, client-server computing
provides users with greater flexibility to gather and make use of the mass
of data within any organisation. At the same time, there is still the
ability to control the environment centrally.
Client-server computing really does seem to be driven by end-users sitting
at their PCs and desiring seamless access to applications and data.
To satisfy these rapidly growing end-user expectations, companies may well
find themselves adopting elements of client-server computing, perhaps
without really realising it. In doing so, they are seeking a solution, not
chasing an industry fad. Quite rightly, this is the way of things in today's
customer-driven computer industry.

FT  07 APR 92 / Survey of The Computer Industry (8): Profitable dinosaurs -
Mainframes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MAINFRAMES are no longer the mainstay of the computer industry nor at the
centre of technological interest, but represent a significant source of
profits for those companies determined to remain as full-line computer
suppliers.
The list is short and exclusive. It includes International Business
Machines, Fujitsu (including its 80 per cent-owned subsidiary, ICL), Hitachi
(which distributes its machines through Hitachi Data Systems and Comparex),
Digital Equipment, whose 9000 series represents its first venture into
mainframes, NEC, Unisys, Amdahl, Siemens-Nixdorf and Groupe Bull, as well as
AT&amp;T which took over NCR last year.
Olivetti markets Hitachi mainframes within Italy. Unisys, formed in the
1980s from Burroughs and Univac, still markets two lines of mainframe
although they are converging in hardware components if not in software.
For those companies, the ratio 20:40:60 is an important set of numbers,
representing approximately the gross profit margins on personal computers,
mid-range machines and mainframes respectively.
It is a prime cause of the hiatus among mainframe manufacturers. The
personal computer sector, with the lowest gross margins, is growing the
fastest at 10-20 per cent a year; mainframe growth is essentially flat at
about 3 per cent or less. So, while computer companies derive the greatest
part of profits from mainframe sales, the mainframe sector is the slowest
growing part.
The reasons are twofold:
First, the mainframe business is now essentially mature; there are few new
customers to be found and existing customers are usually wedded to existing
suppliers by the cost and complexity of changing software. There are few
competitive knock-outs.
Second, the trend to 'downsizing' using a smaller, less expensive computer
based on modern technology to replace a mainframe is growing. Downsizing is
possible because many applications traditionally run on mainframes can be
processed more economically on today's high performance mid-range machines.
Nevertheless, according to estimates by the marketing consultancy Infocorp,
the cumulative market for systems which cost more than Dollars 700,000 will
total Dollars 95bn this year growing to Dollars 106bn next.
Who, therefore, still needs these dinosaurs of the data processing business?
Mr John Gardner, managing director of ICL's UK operations, points out that
many companies still have a need for centralised data processing, especially
where large data bases have to be searched - 'big transaction processing
operations demand a mainframe; batch processing, however, is on the way
out.'
By 2000, however, Mr Gardner believes Unix, the 'open' operating system
favoured by companies downsizing their computing activities, will be able to
handle large databases and transaction processing as efficiently as
proprietary systems such as IBM's MVS or ICL's VME.
IBM has the lion's share of the mainframe business and is likely to retain
much of it. However, according to Price Waterhouse, the management
consultancy, its share of the market has slipped from almost 75 per cent in
1985 to about 57 per cent in 1991. It faces new and aggressive competition
from leading Japanese players Fujitsu, Hitachi and NEC. Fujitsu, indeed, is
now reckoned to have displaced western manufacturers as the leading
mainframe designer.
By comparison with the stolid mainframe computer business, the world of
supercomputers has been turned upside down recently.
Supercomputers are designed to operate as fast as the laws of physics will
allow. Sometimes their designers seem more interested in the speed of their
machines than to the application. They chiefly come into the public eye
through their use in carrying out the immense calculations needed for
weather forecasting; more recently, the UK Atomic Energy Authority's Cray 2
computer at Harwell achieved fame for taking 19 hours of computational time
to discover the largest prime number.
A few years ago, the supercomputer market was a set piece; battle lines were
drawn between Cray of the US and the three large Japanese manufacturers,
Fujitsu, Hitachi and NEC. Control Data, the US computing pioneer which had
earlier dropped out of the battle because of rising costs, returned through
a marketing agreement with NEC.
There was skirmishing on the technological and political level. Cray claimed
its software superiority gave its machines the edge over the blinding speed
apparently obtainable from Japanese computers such as NEC's SX-3.
US politicians complained that the Japanese market was closed to US
supercomputer makers; Japanese makers were excluded from the public sector
under pressure from Congress and the Bush administration.
Unabashed, Fujitsu has unveiled plans to market its most powerful machines
to the US private sector at prices ranging from Dollars 2m to Dollars 17m.
The advent of 'massively parallel' computers has completely changed
supercomputing and allowed new players into the market. Massively parallel
systems involve networks of microprocessors working together to give
substantial computing power. The pioneers include Alliant Computer Systems,
Convex Computer, Maspar and Stardent.
The technology has enabled microprocessor manufacturers such as Intel to
become supercomputer manufacturers in their own right. Microprocessor chips
are becoming the key to supercomputing; in particular, the microprocessors
designed around reduced instruction set computing (risc).
Last month, Hewlett Packard, a leader in medium-sized computers, signed an
agreement with Convex to use HP's risc chips and Convex software technology
to develop massively parallel supercomputers.
Cray is still the world leader in traditional (vector-processing)
supercomputers with a range stretching from the multimillion-dollar C90 to
the air cooled, entry level Y-MP EL. The company has agreed to use a new
32-bit risc chip, the alpha chip, developed by Digital Equipment (DEC) to
develop a massively parallel computer.
The experts are now convinced that software, rather than hardware, will be
the key to the evolution of the fastest calculating machines man has
designed.

FT  07 APR 92 / Survey of The Computer Industry (6): Impact of 'downsizing'
 -Competition intensifies in the workstations market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE BLACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CHALLENGE to Sun Microsystems' leadership of the workstation market has
been growing in recent months.
Hewlett-Packard has been gaining ground on Sun since its acquisition of
Apollo in 1989. Last year it narrowed the gap; Sun had around 42 per cent of
unit sales against HP's 20 per cent, but as HP achieved higher average
prices the two were much closer on revenue.
Powerful workstations using the UNIX operating systems started to become
popular in technical sites in the mid-1980s and have since started to spread
into general use, becoming one of the fastest-growing sectors of the
industry. Last year, both Sun and HP had trouble keeping up with the rising
demand.
Mr John Coon, Sun's product marketing manager, says this expansion is caused
mainly by users 'downsizing' - shifting their software from mainframes and
minicomputers to client-server systems.
These systems consist of top-end workstations configured as the server, or
database machine, linked to low-end workstations tuned as the client's
vehicle for tools and applications.
John Coon notes that there is a simultaneous movement of 'upsizing' among PC
users who need more power for their applications software. Although the
majority of workstations are still in the technical area, computer users in
the commercial world, especially in the financial sector, are increasingly
preferring workstations to PCs for complex applications.
The competition among suppliers has now grown so fierce that profits on the
hardware have eroded. For a manufacturer to make any profit on a machine
sold for under Pounds 10,000, it has to sell in large numbers.
Last year the number of systems sold worldwide grew by 40 per cent, but the
value of sales grew by only 30 per cent. The average price of a workstation
thus fell by around 8 per cent to around Pounds 10,000. This trend is
forecast to continue.
Distributors and dealers talk of workstations turning, like personal
computers, into a commodity market.
HP's UK workstation marketing manager Mr Richard Owen disputes this,
pointing out that workstations - unlike PCs - are still not fully
standardised and still require more expertise than PCs both to assemble and
to manage.
But the distinction between PCs and workstations has certainly begun to
blur. Prices overlap, with most PCs at Pounds 700-Pounds 4,000 and most
workstations at Pounds 2,500-Pounds 12,000; and the user-friendliness of
workstations now approaches that of PCs.
Price/performance is one of the buyer's main criteria and advances by this
measure are startling. The principal players leapfrog each other about every
six to nine months.
In selecting equipment, workstation users are often more discerning and
demanding than PC users and will replace their systems more quickly -
sometimes after only two years. Therefore the opportunity to sell a new
model as the best available is short; and the cost of developing the next
machine has to be strictly controlled to win a reasonable return on
investment.
The HP9000 Series 700 is generally thought to have had the advantage in
price/performance over Sun's Sparcstations for some months, but Sun is
expected to try to jump over HP again by late this year, according to Mr Per
Andersen of market research firm IDC.
While the battle is most fierce at the top end of the market for the
prestige of having the fastest box, there is also a struggle at the low end,
where HP and DEC are trying to shake Sun's dominant position.
Most vendors have aimed to gain as big a market share as possible in the
belief that this will attract software developers and thus ensure survival.
Software availability is a more important criterion than price/performance
for many users.
The compatibility of workstations based on the UNIX standard is crucial to
ensuring that software developers can port their programs to a new machine
as soon as it is launched and thus benefit from the whole of its short
lifecycle.
All the main vendors have been trying to expand the market by taking the
workstation from the technical into the commercial field. Here it is Sun
which has so far had most success. Its strength in graphics and database
management have been paramount.
The vendors still need to find reasons why commercial users should want so
much power. The answer will probably be to run complex new software which
will become available in the next few years; for instance, multimedia
applications.
To run these will take not only a lot of power but more advanced graphics,
networking and operating system capabilities. At this point many more users
may decide to replace their PCs with workstations.
IBM and Digital are striving to come from behind to threaten Sun and HP.
Open systems purists have been sceptical about IBM'S Risc/6000 (until
recently called the RS/6000) machine.
Some regard it as not truly open on the grounds that the AIX operating
system is an IBM proprietary version of UNIX rather than the industry
standard. However, to many IBM customers this may not be any deterrent.
IBM UK's AIX business unit manager, Mr Clive Parminter says its large
customers are beginning to order Risc/60005 in volume. There are now several
hundred software houses developing programs for the Risc/6000 and the
company's Chiswick porting centre has a waiting list. The surge in sales of
the Risc/6000 may be proving embarrassing for IBM, as it hoped to target the
machine only at the technical sector.
Instead, commercial users are adopting it rather than the AS/400 mid-range
machine running proprietary software which IBM would prefer them to buy.
Digital also has difficulties in the workstation market. It has been losing
market share in UNIX systems for a couple of years. The company plans to
overtake Sun and HP with its Alpha 64-bit chip, but it will be at least a
year and maybe two before this makes any significant impact.
Existing Sun users are unlikely to convert to HP, DEC or IBM in large
numbers unless a wide margin in price/performance emerges.
Few technical sites can afford to scrap their investment in technology or
have the resources to cope with maintaining a multi-vendor environment.
Therefore the battle of the vendors will be mainly for new users.

FT  07 APR 92 / Survey of The Computer Industry (7): Battle of the giants -
Midrange systems market is transformed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE 'mid-range' of the computer market is a moving target. Traditionally
defined in terms of mainframe and minicomputer performance, it has recently
been transformed by the emergence of networked 'client-server' combinations
that represent a powerful new alternative.
This is the ground that companies such as Digital Equipment and
Hewlett-Packard are fighting over. It is also the prime target of
workstation market leader, Sun Microsystems.
International Business Machines addresses the mid-range with its widely used
AS/400 systems today, but its RS/6000 workstation technology is clearly also
a contender.
Few doubt that before long the 'mid-range' will be claimed by systems based
upon Reduced Instruction Set Computing (RISC) microprocessors. This is
spawning an industry-wide battle among different RISC architectures, with
the designers of each RISC chip seeking the endorsement of several computer
makers in a drive to encourage proliferation of applications software
development.
Sun Microsystems, with its SPARC chip, established the pattern by
encouraging other computer makers to build computers ranging from portable
personal computers to supercomputers based upon SPARC microprocessor chips.
Sun's strategy has been to emulate the success of standards in the personal
computer market, where hundreds of 'clone' makers use Intel chips to build
IBM-compatible personal computers and software developers have flocked to
produce thousands of applications programs.
To date, however, few SPARC machines, other than those produced by Sun
Microsystems itself, have had a significant impact in the marketplace. As a
result, there is growing disaffection among SPARC chipmakers who find
themselves largely dependent upon Sun for sales of the devices.
Mips Computer attempted to form an alliance of hardware and software
companies to establish a new standard architecture. The so-called 'Ace
initiative' appears, however, to be losing momentum since the acquisition of
Mips Computer, last month, by Silicon Graphics, a workstation manufacturer.
Hewlett-Packard has taken a different tack by selectively licensing its
PA-RISC technology to a small group of companies that it believes are
willing to make a long-term commitment to the architecture, while
establishing an organisation to promote a broader base of support for
PA-RISC among software developers and other third parties by establishing
interface standards.
Development of PA-RISC standards will allow customers to purchase widely
available, or 'shrink-wrapped,' software and operate it on many PA-RISC
systems, HP promises.
As a result, the company claims, software developers will be able to deliver
their products to a larger PA-RISC market, and manufacturers will benefit
from an increasingly broad base of software solutions that support PA-RISC
technology.
HP lost out to IBM in its bid to make Groupe Bull of France a key partner in
its PA-RISC efforts. However, Convex a leading US manufacturer of
supercomputers, recently announced plans to use PA-RISC in its future
massively parallel processing (MPP) systems.
Other HP partners include Hitachi, Hughes Aircraft, Mitsubishi Electric, Oki
Electric, Prime Computer, Sequoia Systems and Yokagawa Electric.
International Business Machines has partnered with Apple Computer and Groupe
Bull to expand the use of its 'Power' RISC architecture which is currently
used in IBM's RS/6000 workstation products.
Digital Equipment is also looking for potential users of its recently
unveiled Alpha chip, claimed to have the highest performance of any RISC
chip to date.
Cray Research has chosen the Alpha chip as the basis for a new massively
parallel supercomputer. This frenzy of industry activity reflects the
growing significance of RISC technology for a broadening spectrum of
computers.
Used singly, the chips can power high performance desktop computers. In
multiprocessor systems they represent a lower-cost alternative to
traditional mid-range computers.
RISC technology is also playing a key role in the adoption of a new
'client-server' model of distributed computing in which processing tasks are
shared among a collection of networked computers. Client-server is a radical
departure from traditional information hierarchical systems with a 'host'
mainframe or minicomputer at the centre attached by spokes to 'dumb'
terminals.
The personal computer began to outmode hierarchical systems by placing
significant processing power on the desktop. The RISC workstation, with its
higher performance computing capabilities is driving home the advantage of
client-server computing.
While lower cost is a primary attraction of client-server computing, its
real advantages lie in the ability to provide all computer users in a
corporation with real-time access to all of a company's information
technology resources. New applications can be added relatively simply.
'Today, 70 cents out of every dollar spent on corporate information systems
goes toward maintaining the infrastructure,' says Bruce Golden, director of
commercial market development at Sun Microsystems Computer. 'Only 30 cents
is spent on developing new applications.'
With client-server systems, that spending ratio will eventually be turned on
its head, Mr Golden predicts. Personal computers and workstations compete
for the desktop in the new client-server arena.
In routine applications, the lower cost personal computer wins out.
Workstations hold the advantage, however, for complex applications such as
customer service where multiple data bases may need to be interrogated and
several applications run simultaneously in order to provide a virtually
instantaneous response to a customer's question.
Client-server computing may ultimately deliver upon the promise of computers
to increase white collar productivity, enabling banks to process loan
applications in seconds, rather than hours, retailers to audit inventories
in hours rather than days and advertisers to produce graphics in minutes
rather than hours.

FT  07 APR 92 / Survey of The Computer Industry (4): Braced for storms -
Japanese Manufacturers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL DAVIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR JAPANESE computer makers, these are turbulent times. A diverse set of
trends is causing stormy conditions in the industry - and those companies
that fail to latch on to prevailing trends will inevitably suffer.
Japanese computer giants, such as Fujitsu, Hitachi and NEC, are seeking to
sell more mainframes just when customers are learning that networks of
minicomputers, workstations and high-powered personal computers are often
sufficient for the jobs at hand.
Apple Computer and other American companies are carving out greater slices
of Japan's computer market, due to aggressive sales strategies.
Furthermore, Compaq Computer is finally gearing-up its sales efforts in
Tokyo. These and other companies are seeking to gain ground by taking
advantage of downsizing, (using many smaller computers to replace large
ones).
'Due to the trend toward downsizing, not much recovery can be expected in
Japan's mainframe market segment in the near-term,' says Barry Dargan,
senior technology analyst at James Capel Tokyo.
The slowing of Japan's economy and poor sales of semiconductors are two
basic trends hurting the big Tokyo-based computer-makers. NEC and Fujitsu
recently announced dramatically lower profit estimates for the fiscal year
ended March 31.
However, opportunities abound for those suppliers nimble enough to recognise
such trends as the expected sales growth of laptop and notebook computers,
featuring improved screens.
For Japan's mainframe makers, the world has turned upside down because their
prior strengths have become weaknesses.
It simply is not possible for large companies to make nearly all computer
components while selling product lines ranging from notebook/laptops to
supercomputers.
Fujitsu, described as the world's 'number two' computer-maker after its
mid-1990 acquisition of ICL, is the typical Japanese vertically-integrated
electronics colossus, producing everything from memory microchips to
mainframes and supercomputers.
Such all-encompassing know-how is a sore point as well as a strength,
because it means the company could be slow to recognise promising trends
that can be spotted by clever and agile entrepreneurs. Like IBM in the US,
Fujitsu has found that it is too slow-moving due to its immense size.
Despite problems in Japan, Fujitsu's California-based affiliate, Amdahl, is
enjoying success in the US with its new line of mainframes. Also in the US,
Fujitsu America is re-entering the supercomputer market.
Computer market niches are rarely exploited by behemoths because corporate
bureaucracies, such as those of Hitachi or Fujitsu, lack the nimble
qualities of Sun Microsystems or Silicon Graphics.
Bloated bureaucracies at Japan's 'big three' computer-makers are fixated on
perceived needs to make nearly all hardware for computers, while also
focusing on communications equipment and microchips (NEC and Fujitsu) and
even nuclear-power plants, (Hitachi).
Pressure on NEC, Fujitsu and Hitachi comes from many areas and with varying
intensity.
IBM Japan is proving adept at capitalising on the strengths of Japanese
partners like Toshiba, with which it is developing liquid-crystal displays
(LCDs) via a joint venture. IBM Japan is re-organising its labyrinthine
structure with an emphasis on streamlining; the idea is to enable business
sectors to act more like entrepreneurs.
As for NEC, its main strength in the form of dominating Japan's personal
computer market, with a slice of over 50 per cent, is emerging as a minor
headache.
Many other PC makers are slowly chipping away at NEC's dominant share of the
Japanese market; and its mainframes and supercomputers are not
IBM-compatible.
Another weakness is NEC's tie with Groupe Bull, which has never amounted to
much. In the US, NEC earlier this year linked up in supercomputer sales with
Control Data, itself entrenched in a weak position.
Hitachi appears to have the greatest weakness of all: it has been extremely
slow to enter into joint ventures with American innovators, and cannot rely
forever on its keiretsu business partners for computer sales.
Hitachi is collaborating with Texas Instruments in developing 64-megabit
dynamic random access memory (DRAM) microchips.
Fujitsu, NEC and Hitachi are all feeling the pressure - not only from
supercomputer pioneer Cray Research, but also from a number of US
innovators. These include Thinking Machines and Kendall Square Research in
the emerging market of massively parallel machines; and Convex Computer in
the 'low end' of the supercomputer market.
Also, in the massively parallel computer market, both IBM and Digital
Equipment Corporation have made strong commitments to meet emerging
customer-needs.
While they try to protect market share in product lines as diverse as
supercomputers, mainframes, workstations and laptop-notebooks, Fujitsu, NEC
and Hitachi are eyeing the next promising data-processing market - that of
pen-input computers.
This up-and-coming market segment is gaining popularity in the US, but it is
perhaps most promising in Japan. This is so because Japan's kanji writing
system is not so easy to input via traditional keyboards.
Many Japanese computer users would prefer to 'write,' rather than punch
keys. Yet, so far, Japan's 'big three' appear slow to capitalise on
pen-based computers.
Another area that the Japanese giants covet is fault-tolerant computers,
featuring back-up systems to prevent computer 'crashes.'
For example, Fujitsu offers so-called 'Sure System" computers. But US
companies such as Tandem Computers have established positions that they will
not surrender without a battle.
Fujitsu, the company that sells everything from semiconductors to
supercomputers, accounts for only about 1 per cent of the global PC and
workstation market, according to Dataquest.
It is not as if Fujitsu lacks innovative qualities: its FM-Towns multimedia
computer was the first PC to come with a CD-ROM (or compact-disk read-only
memory).
Despite the apparent weaknesses of the Japanese behemoths, owing to their
'we do everything' approach, research strengths in a few emerging
technologies may eventually prove sufficient to boost their computer
prospects.

FT  07 APR 92 / Survey of The Computer Industry (5): Prices have plummeted -
Personal Computers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVEN SONSINO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BUYING a small car five years ago cost less than buying a powerful personal
computer with hard disc and laser printer. While car costs have risen
significantly since then, PC prices have plummeted. They have fallen by up
to 50 per cent in the last 12 months alone.
One company that has profited from the price tumble is Apple Computer, which
has finally resolved its customers' main criticism: that Apple PCs were too
expensive. Now the Macintosh range starts at well under Pounds 1,000 and
compares well on price with what Apple calls second-tier clones.
By this, it does not mean expensive IBM and Compaq machines, the darlings of
the corporate market, but the ASTs and Dells of the box buyers' world at
Pounds 3,000-4,000.
The reasons behind the collapse in PC prices are a complex mix of falling
demand, falling component prices and fluctuating foreign exchanges. Advanced
manufacturing techniques have also had their part to play in cutting costs.
The squeeze has left the most basic 386SX-based machines from companies such
as Opus costing about Pounds 1,200. Top of the range 486-based machines from
Kyocera cost Pounds 6,000 or more.
As PCs become commodity products, able to run any and all software, and as
dealer margins become ever tighter, there is a clear move away from the
traditional PC dealership, towards selling PCs direct to the user.
Some companies, such as Dell, have been using direct sales - mail order -
successfully for some time, throughout the recession.
The search for new distribution channels is also an important facet of Apple
Computer's strategy for the 1990s. The company is looking at new ways of
extending its impact into the high street, away from its network of
AppleCentres.
'We're certainly looking at the high street,' says Jan Edbrooke, Apple's
product marketing manager for high volume and notebook products. 'You can
see the names there for yourself. And while I can't comment on any specific
retailer, because we're in negotiations with a number of them, we want to
make sure that we are in places where people consider personal computer
purchases.'
The company is also looking to work with computer superstores, such as PC
World in Croydon, which Apple believes will revolutionise PC sales in much
the same way as Texas and B&amp;Q tackled the DIY market.
ICL, the Fujitsu subsidiary, takes a Littlewoods approach to selling its
PCs. It compiles a book or brochure which lists and illustrates its kit and
publishes this to key buyers.
The company has also budgeted for a Pounds 10m European launch of Nokia Data
and ICL machines, at last unified after the takeover of the Finnish company
last year. The tour kicks off this month with a separate Pounds 1.5m launch
at the National Exhibition Centre, near Birmingham. ICL promises an
'earth-moving experience' for about 10,000 corporate buyers.
John Arnell, ICL's business manager for personal systems, says volume
shipments of the collection, based on Intel 80386SX and 80486SX-based
machines, will start this month.
Prices, without keyboard and monitor, run from Pounds 1,200 for a 20MHz
CS386, to about Pounds 10,000 for a 33/50MHz Deskside MX486. The key
question for ICL is how successful will the new systems be?
On past performance it is difficult to believe that the wholesale
acquisition of Nokia Data's ergonomic know-how or its manufacturing capacity
is enough to revive ICL's reputation in the PC sphere.
The company does, however, have a broad installed base of mid-range and
mainframe systems, especially in local government, and there is little doubt
that it has effective distribution channels. ICL's traditional 100-strong
dealer base has been integrated quickly with Nokia's channels, so it will
simply be a question of wait and see.
For users, potentially the most rewarding aspects of PC vendor strategies
are the various collaborations on the cards.
With differentiation between product lines all but extinguished by the
pressure to carve a slice of the commodity PC market, the only direction for
the future can come from shared distribution channels or from shared
research and development.
On the distribution side, IBM is taking large numbers of portables from
Zenith Data Systems, for instance, and is said to be talking to Olivetti
about a similar distribution deal.
In R&amp;D, IBM and Toshiba are already sharing the fruits of their joint liquid
crystal display development programme, while Apple is talking to consumer
electronics companies such as Sharp and Sony about its plans for 'personal
digital assistants.'
The most promising of the collaborations, however, are those from IBM and
Apple, at last working together on a range of joint ventures.
This surprising relationship between long-time rivals has yet to prove its
worth in real terms, but the potential value to users of the venture is
immense. It comes down to cost, connectivity and power.
Already, the duo is working on linking IBM and Apple networks. Products are
also released. These include a Token Ring adapter card that allows
Macintoshes to run on 4Mbit and 16Mbit local area networks.
Further nods in each other's directions include support for Apple's
proprietary network AppleTalk on OS/2 servers as well as a new open systems
environment called PowerOpen, intended to run IBM's Unix operating system,
AIX, and Macintosh applications on the same machine.
But perhaps the most exciting of all the IBM-Apple plans is the Kaleida
venture, in which the strange bedfellows will develop and license video,
sound and animation technologies for multi-media applications - expect to
see a variety of cheap laptop and hand-held interactive devices by 1993.
Almost every PC manufacturer is bandying the term around at present, but to
many multimedia still seems like a technology looking for an application,
rather like desktop publishing was, five years ago.
A survey of 1,500 UK executives conducted by the British Institute of
Management and Microsoft, the US software company, suggests that nine out of
ten managers are still intimidated by personal computers. Add to this the
speed with which technology advances and the changing nature of distribution
channels, and corporate buyers face a complex gamble.
How can they implement a sensible, long-term computing strategy, if the
systems they choose today will be obsolete within 18 months?
As always in the PC world, there are no easy answers.

FT  07 APR 92 / Survey of The Computer Industry (3): Toughest time ever for
European players - Hardware suppliers are on the defensive as profits plunge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BUSINESS has never been easy for Europe's computer hardware manufacturers,
and it has probably never been tougher.
A combination of the economic recession, fierce competition from US and
Asia, and shifting end-user requirements has forced the few remaining full
range European players on to the defensive.
The past few years have seen a radical restructuring of the European
industry and the formation of new defensive and strategic alliances,
including some with the US and Japanese computer makers, who dominate the
world market and have shown increasing interest in Europe in the run-up to
the Single European Market.
The US has the largest share in the world of information technology (IT),
representing about 42 per cent of the Dollars 545bn world market. However,
the European market, with a share of 34 per cent, is growing fast and is
expected to become the largest market during the 1990s, according to
Datamonitor, the independent market analysts. Hopes that a new European
computer super-champion might emerge to compete with International Business
Machines (IBM) and Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) of the US and Fujitsu
of Japan, vanished in 1990 when Fujitsu acquired ICL of the UK. Since then
ICL, at present the only profitable European computer hardware group, has
acquired Nokia Data.
In the meantime, DEC has acquired Keinzle, a minicomputer maker which was
once owned by Mannesman of Germany, and last year purchased the
mini-computer interests of Philips of the Netherlands.
Of the top 10 information technology companies in the world in 1990, only
three were European, and they were eighth, ninth and tenth. Siemens-Nixdorf
Information Systems ranks number eight with worldwide IT revenues of Dollars
7.73bn, Olivetti (ninth) with revenues of Dollars 6.4bn and Group Bull
(tenth) with IT revenues of Dollars 6.35bn. All three are losing money.
While Siemens's computer operations were modestly profitable before the
merger with loss-making Nixdorf, Group Bull and Olivetti have been
restructured in an effort tostem losses. Together, the three had combined
European IT revenues of about Dollars 16.8bn in 1990, or only about 11.6 per
cent of a market dominated by IBM.
The fact that even Europe's biggest IT groups are small in comparison with
their US and Japanese rivals, reflects the historical fragmentation of the
European market and the effect of nationalism in European countries. This
has meant that Siemens-Nixdorf, Bull and Olivetti have remained principally
domestic full range manufacturers. Significantly, the four largest western
European markets in 1991 were Germany (Dollars 23.9bn), France (Dollars
19.4bn), UK (Dollars 16.3bn) and Italy (Dollars 11.4bn).
In spite of mergers and acquisitions, there is still substantial
overcapacity and margins for hardware manufacturers are shrinking.
There is a trend towards smaller products ('down-sizing' or 'right-sizing')
as technological advances enable each generation of products to pack the
same or more power than their larger predecessors. Thus, today's desktop
computer has all the power of a mainframe a decade ago, but the margins on
the new technology are much lower.
As computers have become more commonplace, they have also become more
standardised as end-users have become more experienced and have demanded
'open systems' (and the common platform provided by versions of the Unix
operating system). In theory, this means equipment from different
manufactures can work together and is interchangeable. This has led to the
'commoditisation' of IT equipment. This has also made it easier to enter the
market but more difficult for vendors to differentiate products and has led
to thinner margins for manufacturers than on proprietary systems.
In turn, hardware companies are being forced to move into new areas where
they can 'add value' to their products and boost margins. Led by ICL, they
are moving into computer software and services to leverage their revenues
from hardware products. As such, they are trying to present themselves as
providers of 'systems solutions,' rather than merely hardware vendors.
'One of the important trends which has been with us for a while is for
hardware manufacturers to realise that the business is about more than just
hardware,' says Dr Aodh O'Dochartaigh of ICL.
This means hardware manufacturers are no longer simply competing with each
other. As they move into other services in search of new business and higher
margins, they are increasingly in competition with existing software
providers, computer services companies and the telecommunications groups.
The big European IT groups have traditionally had highly centralised
structures, but falling margins have forced them to look for ways to cut
costs and improve productivity. To compel individual businesses to become
more competitive, European IT companies are now decentralising control of
their operations.
Since a full-blown merger of Europe's remaining independent IT groups is
thought unlikely, it is also clear that to survive, European IT groups are
having to reach product marketing agreements and form strategic alliances
with powerful partners. Such agreements can provide economies of scale, and
also help offset the costs of research and development activities.
For example, after protracted negotiations with Hewlett-Packard among
others, Groupe Bull reached a broad agreement with IBM last year. As part of
the agreement, Groupe Bull will obtain access to IBM's Reduced Instruction
Set Computing (Risc) expertise and IBM will gain increased manufacturing
volumes, improved distribution and access to Bull's expertise in
multiprocessing and networking. In addition, IBM is taking an equity stake
in Bull and will resell about 100,000 portable computers made by Bull's
Zenith Data Systems subsidiary under its own label.
Groupe Bull had been hit by increased competition in the European market
from Japanese and US manufacturers which were seeking to bolster their
sagging profits. To address these problems, Bull instituted a restructuring
plan - necessitating a FFr 4bn provision in 1990 - which includes
consolidating manufacturing sites, large-scale redundancies and focusing on
markets where it has a sustainable advantage, and negotiating alliances.
There are persistent rumours that Olivetti is also seeking strategic
alliances. The company confirmed late last year that it had held preliminary
discussions with Cap Gemini Sogeti, the leading European software and
computer services house. Olivetti needs a software partner to boost its
activities in that area.
Like Groupe Bull, Olivetti, which has traditionally been very strong in PC's
and office equipment, has seen profits plunge. It announced a Dollars 242.2m
loss for 1991. Olivetti has also been shedding jobs, aiming to cut its
workforce by 12 per cent from 47,000 in 1990. However, Olivetti's has little
room tomanoeuvre. In spite of lengthy negotiations with the Italian
government and trade unions, the company has had to accept fewer
redundancies than planned.
In theory, Siemens-Nixdorf should be the strongest and largest of the three
independent European groups. However, it has taken longer than expected to
integrate the two IT operations following the merger and the group has
blamed customer uncertainty, the recession and marketplace pressure for
losses.
The European computer groups have sought assistance from the European
Commission. However, while the Commission is keen to help indigenous
producers, it says it cannot provide aid or other forms of subsidies which
would be seen as anti-competitive.
Through various research programmes, especially Esprit, the Commission has,
however, encouraged and part-funded collaboration on pre-competitive
research and has agreed to support plans for a large project which has
become known as the European Nervous System (ENS) - designed as a
trans-national high speed data highway which could be used for co-ordinating
such common functions as EC social policy and certain tax receipts.
Mr Bruno Lamborghini, Olivetti's director for economic research, says: 'The
European industry is not dead - it is not finished. It has many skills and
resources to take advantage of the enlargement of the market.'
What happens to the European industry in the short term is likely to depend
on the economic environment. But in the long term, it is already clear that
the computer, consumer electronics and telecommunications industries are
moving ever closer.

FT  07 APR 92 / Survey of The Computer Industry (2): Why red ink is flowing
in the US - Downturn in computer sales revenues forces painful adjustments
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE 1990s, heralded as the information age, have so far turned out to be an
era of stagnation for the US computer industry.
Last year, for the first time in the industry's history, world computer
sales revenues declined. In the US, traditionally the most buoyant computer
market, the downturn has been particularly acute as large corporations slash
their information technology budgets and smaller businesses hold down
expenditures by delaying new computer purchases.
Red ink is flowing throughout the US computer industry, with both
International Business Machines and Digital Equipment, the two largest US
computer makers, reporting losses in the fourth quarter and numerous smaller
companies reporting disappointing results.
The personal computer segment has been particularly hard hit, with sales
revenues declining sharply amidst rampant price cutting. In the US, the
desktop personal computer has become a 'commodity' product, with price as
the only differentiating factor between dozens of different brands that are
sold supermarket-style in large suburban 'superstores.'
Desktop personal computer purchases by large US corporations declined by 16
per cent last year, according to a survey conducted by Peter Rogers and
Natalie Billion, financial analysts at Robertson Stephens of San Francisco.
'The US corporate market for personal computers may be approaching
saturation,' the analysts conclude. Seventy three percent of potential
corporate users surveyed already have a personal computer.
Mainframe computer sales also declined last year, according to Dataquest's
world-wide data, from Dollars 30.58bn in 1990 to Dollars 26.9bn, a 12 per
cent drop.
'The computer systems industry ran into two very high hurdles in 1991; the
negative state of the worldwide economy and the mammoth organisational
structures many vendors were supporting,' says Nancy Stewart, a senior
industry analyst at Dataquest.
'In the face of this maturing market we can expect to see further
cost-cutting measures and restructuring from vendors in 1992.'
Even the largest computer companies are being forced to make painful
adjustments; cutting jobs and consolidating manufacturing facilities.
Digital Equipment, for example, recently offered early retirement incentives
to ten percent of its US workforce.
International Business Machines is also restructuring its vast empire in an
effort to become faster on its feet. Leading US computer companies remain
cautious about the outlook for 1992.
A survey of corporate computer buyers conducted by Paine Webber analysts in
late December 1991 concluded that even when the US economy finally rebounds,
there is unlikely to be a marked increase in spending on computers.
Only 24 per cent of over 400 companies surveyed said that they would
increase spending on mainframes and minicomputers if the economy were to
improve.
However, 64 per cent would spend more on software. Instead of buying new
computers, many US companies are looking for ways to extend the uses of the
machines they already own. This trend is particularly apparent in the
personal computer segment where software sales are soaring but hardware
sales revenues are declining.
North American personal computer software sales grew by over 33 per cent in
the fourth quarter of 1991, compared to the same period a year earlier,
according to the Software Publishers Association. In contrast, personal
computer hardware sales declined by eight percent last year, according to
Dataquest, the US market research group.
The other beneficiaries of cost-conscious recessionary psychology are
workstation manufacturers whose products represent a lower cost alternative
to traditional office computer systems based on mainframes or minicomputers.
Computer workstations represent one of the few bright spots in the computer
market, with sales continuing to expand, albeit at a slower pace than in the
past.
The workstation, which initially was geared to scientific and engineering
users, is now making significant inroads into the commercial market.
Sales to business users are the fastest growing segment of the workstation
market and account for one-third of Sun Microsystems business, says Bruce
Golden, director of commercial market development at Sun.
It is becoming increasingly apparent that the end of the US economic
downturn, whenever that occurs, will not resolve the problems faced by many
computer manufacturers. In fact, the recession has only exacerbated the
effects of a fundamental technology shift that is undermining the business
model of established leaders in the US computer industry.
The root of the turmoil in the computer industry lies in semiconductor
technology advances that have produced microprocessor chips which today
provide the computing power of mainframe computers build in the early 1980s.
Computers built around these chips sell for a fraction of the price of
mainframes and minicomputers. The 'computer on a chip' has already spawned
two new categories of computers; the personal computer, which became a
commercial product in the early 1980s, and the computer workstation, which
became a significant market segment in the mid-1980s.
Now the microprocessor chip is beginning to infiltrate the mid-range
computer segment in the form of high-powered 'servers' for computer
networks, that usurp the traditional role of the minicomputer.
By 1994, according to some industry watchers, the microprocessor will make
its appearance in a new generation of mainframe computers.
The advent of microprocessor based mainframe computers is expected to
produce another sharp reduction in the cost of computer power. Powerful
microprocessors are one of the enabling technologies behind a fundamental
change in the way computers are used. This shift toward distributed or
'client-server' computing is replacing the hierarchical 'mainframe-centric'
computing of the 1980s and in the process challenging the business models
upon which many leading computer companies have been built.
Another powerful force for change has been the trend toward 'open systems'
or standards that enable different types and brands of computers to work
together. To date, this movement has been focused upon the use of the UNIX
operating system, originated by AT&amp;T.
Over the past few years, the computer industry has engaged in tedious
battles over various aspects of software standards as it struggles to
achieve the promise of 'open systems.'
More important in the future will be tools that enable software developers
to quickly and easily design 'multiplatform' applications programs that can
run on many types of computers regardless of differences in hardware,
operating system, networking protocols or other systems software.

FT  07 APR 92 / Survey of The Computer Industry (1): As profits slide,
nobody is laughing now - After irrevocable changes, the troubled computer
industry is peering into the unknown
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE POWER of the word 'dramatic' to describe change in the global computer
industry has been dissipated by over-use. Few words, however, more
accurately describe either the series of body blows the industry has endured
since the end of the 1980s, or the responses of the larger players to market
conditions which have often seemed out of their control. Rock bottom may
have been reached last year. The most telling statistic reverberated around
the industry, sending shivers down the spines of its senior executives: the
combined half year figures for the world's 10 largest information technology
suppliers showed a 10 percentage point fall in sales, while net income as a
percentage of sales was down six points. Over the year as a whole, the
industry's largest player, International Business Machines, a company
accustomed to believing it owns the data processing business, lost money for
the first time. Revenues slipped by 6 per cent to Dollars 64.8bn, while the
company made a pretax loss of Dollars 2.9bn. The weariness which Mr John
Akers, IBM chairman, must be feeling oozed into his report to shareholders:
'The product transition of our higher-margin, large computer business was
slower than expected; we did not see the returns we anticipated from our
investments in marketing resources and we continued to experience severe
pricing pressures, especially in our storage systems, personal computer,
printer and display businesses.'
Mr Hans-Dieter Wiedig, president and chief executive of the German computer
manufacturer, Siemens Nixdorf Information Systems, expresses some of the
bewilderment the industry is experiencing: 'Nobody could have anticipated
that the leading ten companies of the industry would have losses and reduced
sales. If you had made that prediction two years ago, it would have been
regarded as a joke.'
Today, nobody is laughing. Instead, there is a growing realisation that the
industry has changed irrevocably and that the survivors will be those
companies able to adapt to the new conditions.
It is becoming accepted that the buoyant demand for information technology
equipment which fuelled industry growth rates of 20 per cent a year or more
during the 1980s will not return.
Instead, the computer business will have to obey the rules of more mature
industries. In particular, smaller computers - personal computers,
workstations and network servers - are beginning to sell for prices more
typical of commodity items than sophisticated products. The computer
business is beginning to share many of the attributes of commodity markets -
gross profit margins are narrowing, product differentiation is becoming
difficult, volume sales and effective distribution are becoming essential to
profitability. Gross margins of 60 per cent or more have become 20- 30 per
cent or less.
The reasons for the industry's plight are several and complex. First, there
is the ever-accelerating pace of technological change. The availability of
low-cost computing power in the form of high performance microprocessor
chips is reducing barriers to entry to the industry by reducing the need for
heavy expenditure on research and development.
It has become a comparatively simple task to combine an Intel microprocessor
and Microsoft MS/DOS operating software to create a cheap personal computer.
A consequence has been price competition forcing down the cost of personal
systems by anything from 25 per cent to 40 per cent a year.
The problem for manufacturers is first, to secure effective distribution for
their products. Second, to differentiate their systems from their
competitors.
Compaq, a leader in high performance personal computers, has discovered to
its cost that an established brand name counts for less today than in
previous years. It established a quality image and charged appropriate
prices. Too late, it realised its was overpriced in a market that cared more
about cost than quality.
Its strategy for recovery includes the development of lower priced machines
which maintain Compaq's traditional quality, while selling through a variety
of outlets, including the new industry phenomenon, computer superstores.
Second, the move to 'open systems' among customers is gathering pace. Open
systems implies industry-wide standards. It implies computers built of
standard microchips running standard operating systems. It implies the
ability easily to connect systems from different manufacturers.
The best example of an open operating system is Microsoft's MS/DOS, used on
the majority of personal computers world wide.
Unix, a system originally designed in AT&amp;T's Bell Laboratories, may yet
become the industry standard despite shortcomings in security and ease of
use. Originally designed for engineering workstations, it has been adapted
for use on every size of machine from supercomputers to personal computers.
Manufacturers, by and large, are not enthusiastic about open systems. They
lower prices, cut gross profit margins and reduce the possibilities for
product differentiation. The demand is coming from customers, with
government departments in the vanguard, who are seeking ways of cutting the
cost of data processing.
Against this background of traumatic technological change, the recession in
much of the developed world caught the computer industry off guard.
Decisions on capital spending were delayed as corporations became
increasingly concerned about the future.
And a new caution over the value of information technology is being
experienced by an industry which has taken for granted an annual increment
in the information technology spend.
Mr James Unruh, chairman and chief executive of Unisys, the US computing
giant recovering from a net loss of Dollars 1.3bn in 1991 told analysts
recently: 'Growth has slowed because users are not able to absorb new
technology at today's rate of technological change'.
The strategies for survival adopted by the leading computer makers have
common elements.
'Rightsizing:' restructuring has become common throughout the industry as
companies shed staff to match more modest market expectations. IBM is
creating a slimmer, less bureaucratic organisation comprising a federation
of business units each with its own profit and loss responsibilities. In a
major change of policy, IBM's manufacturing units will be able to sell their
products outside the company if they wish; marketing units will be able to
buy from other suppliers to meet customers' requirements.
Some 20,000 jobs were lost last year and a further 20,000 are expected to go
this year. For the first time, IBM managers are pondering introducing forced
redundancy: their own jobs will be on the line if their units fail to come
up to centrally set profit targets.
Alliances: individual organisations can no longer cover the computing
waterfront. Alliances are necessary to share research and development costs,
provide economies of scale for product sales and increase distribution.
Groupe Bull of France, for example, which lost money heavily both in 1990
and 1991, has formed an alliance with IBM which will give it access to IBM's
reduced instruction set (risc) technology and a new channel for distributing
its Zenith personal computers.
IBM, for its part, secures increased volume for its risc production lines
and access to Bull's well-regarded networking technology. Alliances of this
kind, which may or may not involve equity investment, have become common.
NEC of Japan has a small stake in Bull; Fujitsu of Japan owns ICL of the UK
and has shares in the US companies Amdahl, Hal and Poqet.
Olivetti of Italy has no single major alliance but has placed large
advertisements in national papers to reassure customers that it benefits
from 229 smaller arrangements.
Moves into services: as margins in hardware tighten, manufacturers are
turning to software, maintenance, data communications and recovery services
to maintain revenues. ICL of the UK, for example, now derives more revenues
from services than hardware. It has become the UK's largest services company
ahead of Electronic Data Systems, BT Customer Services, IBM and AT&amp;T Istel.
IBM is forming national organisations to benefit from the trend to
'outsourcing' among customers - placing responsibility for the company's
data processing with a third party.
There is no certainty that any of these measures will succeed. The computer
industry is peering into the unknown. As Mr Francis Lorentz, chairman of
Groupe Bull said recently: 'Nobody knows if there is a way of managing
distribution profitably at 25-30 per cent gross margins.'

FT  06 APR 92 / Russia's third city leads the way in state property sales
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NIZHNY NOVGOROD
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TURNING Russian state into private property began in an organised fashion
yesterday in Russia's third city of Nizhny Novgorod, formerly Gorky, 400
miles west of Moscow.
In terms of volume, this was a small event. It lasted less than two hours
and only a few thousand dollars changed hands. Yet Mr Yegor Gaidar, the
first deputy prime minister, and Mr Anatoly Chubais, the privatisation
minister, came down from Moscow and afterwards described it as 'a turning
point' and 'a breakthrough'.
Why should Nizhny Novgorod be seen in this way, rather than Moscow or St
Petersburg? The International Finance Corporation, the project finance arm
of the World Bank which has underpinned this exercise, points to the city's
lack of corruption. It also cites a strong political will in favour of the
market shown by the mayor and the governor of the region.
Nizhny's Saturday auction was held in a Palace of Culture in the old part of
the town. The building was solidly picketed by some 300 people, mainly women
from some of the 2,000 retail businesses in Nizhny, all of which are due to
be privatised by the end of the year. They held signs with slogans like
'where are you leading us' and 'Don't make us poor again'.
The auction was conducted by Mr Arseny Labanov, a former jockey who now has
his own TV show. The IFC had worked on Mr Labanov, taking him to Prague to
learn from a Czechoslovak auctioneer.
Each of the 22 shops on the list had a starting price, which represented the
book value of the assets: the first, for example, was a food shop which had
a starting price of Rbs9,300 and which was bid up quickly to sell at
Rbs630,000: the highest price was for a crystal shop which sold for Rbs10m.
At the end, 21 of the shops were sold, one being withdrawn because only one
buyer had registered for it.
Among the buyers in Saturday's auction was Mr Swergei Shirokov, manager of
an electrical goods shop. He had bid for the shop on behalf of the staff -
all 57 of whom had chipped in to raise the Rbs2m for which it was sold.
The sale was thought to have gone well. Mr Boris Nemtsov, the governor, and
Mr Dmitri Bednyakov, the mayor, are pressing the IFC to privatise more -
especially the 8,000-strong lorry fleet in the region. Already, the mayors
of other cities are beating a path to the IFC's door, asking for help (which
their resources will not allow).
But beyond the pleasant enough shopping streets are the vast factories which
define Nizhny Novgorod and so many other cities: only the first scratchings
on the surface have begun.

FT  06 APR 92 / US Money And Credit: Hopes of instant recovery quashed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN FRIEDMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MS NANCY KIMELMAN, the chief economist of the technical data division of
Thomson Financial Services in Boston, offered a perspicacious comment about
prospects for the US economy last Friday that should be plastered across the
walls of America's myopic Treasury bond traders.
'We Americans,' said Ms Kimelman, 'are an antsy bunch. We want to be first
in line; we want service immediately; we want our food pre-cooked. We also
want our recessions over quickly and our recoveries to be as instant as
oatmeal. Well, instant oatmeal tastes like mush] A period of stability is
healthy. It's positive for the long run and healthy for the economy.'
Ms Kimelman's message is much in line with the private remarks of top US
bankers. Few of America's business elite expect a rapid economic recovery;
most are looking for growth of only 1 to 2 per cent in the next few months
and nearly all say they expect the recovery to be gradual.
This commonsense perspective remains at odds with the behaviour of both the
bond and equity markets. The stockmarket rallied excessively and anticipated
a jet-propelled recovery in January. The bond market's behaviour in recent
weeks has been erratic and inconsistent. Last week's swings and roundabouts,
ending in a rally based on poor employment data, was typical of this trading
pattern.
Early in the week a 0.8 per cent rise in the government's index of leading
economic indicators failed to move the money men because it was in line with
expectations. On Wednesday traders at first took fright and sold Treasury
bonds when the March index from the National Association of Purchasing
Management (NAPM) rose to 54.1 per cent from 52.4 per cent in February. But
within hours the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond was marked  3/4 point
higher after commentators pronounced the NAPM report to be not as
encouraging as it seemed, especially in the sub-index category of
employment, which fell in March.
On Friday, the market rallied  1/2 a point following the release of March
unemployment numbers showing a meagre gain of 19,000 salaried jobs and a
continued 7.3 per cent national average unemployment rate.
Most economists had been expecting the non-farm employment level to have
increased by 25,000 to 50,000 in March, but when the figures were released
on Friday they failed to meet even these modest market expectations.
Bond traders glanced at the jobs data and factored into the equation last
Thursday's Federal Reserve Board numbers showing a significant contraction
in key monetary aggregates in the week ended March 23. They also noted the
Fed's last Open Market Committee (FOMC) in February had voted to favour a
bias toward easing interest rates if necessary, and they guessed the FOMC
did the same at another meeting last week.
A new trend was born, with the market prepared for more inconclusive
macro-economic data in April and once again hoping for an easing in rates -
which is the exact opposite of its view of a fortnight ago.
Ms Maria Ramirez, a close bond-watcher, summed up the situation this way:
'What a difference a few statistics make] Only two weeks ago a focal point
of discussion in the market was when the Fed would tighten (rates). Now,
perceptions have swung 180 degrees in the other direction to forecasts for
the Fed to ease.'
The benchmark 30-year bond was up  25/32 on the week, to yield 7.87 per cent
last Friday at a price of 101 7/16 . This compared with a yield of 7.94 per
cent a week before. At the shorter end of the market, investors flirted with
two-year notes, marking them  3/4 point higher on Friday to yield 5.35 per
cent at a price of 100 3/4 .
The market views the short end of the market as especially cheap, which is
producing a steeper yield curve as short-term interest rates fall farther
than the long end.
The spread between two-year and 30-year paper is about 250 basis points,
reflecting the conviction that the economic recovery is weak enough and
money supply growth slow enough for the Fed to consider easing rather than
tightening monetary policy. This, at least, was the market mentality late
last week. The trend is unlikely to change in the near future, but that by
no means implies bond traders are prepared to take a broader view of the
world.

FEARS that the Labour party could win this week's general election sparked a
59 per cent increase in tax shelter investments via the business expansion
scheme (BES), according to provisional figures.
Enterprise zone property investment, on which top-rate tax relief is also
available, equalled the returns of 1990-91, in spite of the problems of the
commercial property market. But business for the 1991-92 tax year, which
ended yesterday, failed to fulfil expectations, thanks to the recession,
which reduced the income available for tax shelter.
Provisional estimates from the Allenbridge Group, a large intermediary in
the BES and EZ market, are that companies qualifying for top-rate tax relief
under the BES took in Pounds 407m this year, 59 per cent up on last year's
Pounds 256m, the most taken in one year since the scheme started in 1983-84.
BESt Investment, another intermediary, said investment since the budget had
run at more than Pounds 5m a day.
A surge in demand during the past two weeks brought the total invested in
enterprise zone property trusts to around Pounds 160m, roughly the same as
last year.
EZ schemes were harmed by the financial difficulties of Olympia &amp; York,
which withdrew a scheme to attract Pounds 215m last month. Tighter banking
practices also dampened demand.
EZ investments are often financed by loans, on which tax relief is
available. But this year banks have only accepted around 50 per cent of
applications, according to Mr Anthony Yadgaroff, of Allenbridge.
Accountants urged companies and the self-employed to pay out bonuses in the
1991-92 tax year, rather than wait until 1992-93 and possible higher
marginal taxes under Labour. This was done by many financial services
companies, such as stockbrokers James Capel, and advertising agencies. Much
of the money was put into tax shelters.
Record business is expected for the next four days. BES companies with names
such as Election Hedge will open for investment today, and allocate shares
on Thursday to allow shelter before the election. Labour Party assurances
not to abolish the BES in its first budget only slightly dampened demand.

FT  06 APR 92 / O&amp;Y seeks to reassure holders of public bonds

<TEXT>
OLYMPIA &amp; York has assured holders of public bonds secured by two of its
Canadian buildings that their security is intact and that all payments on
the bonds are up to date.
The debt-burdened developer said security was 'more than adequate' on
CDollars 525m (Pounds 254.8m) of outstanding bonds on First Canadian Place,
its 72-storey Toronto flagship, and 240 Sparks St, a government building in
Ottawa.
O&amp;Y was hit by a liquidity crisis last month after a run on its publicly
traded commercial paper and problems in generating sufficient cash flow to
meet its obligations at the Canary Wharf project in London's Docklands. It
has called its 100 bank lenders to Toronto on April 13 to present debt
restructuring proposals.
The company made no mention of several other buildings in Canada and the US
financed by public debt instruments.
Meanwhile, a debate is under way within the Canadian banks on the
appropriate response to the O&amp;Y crisis. Even by banking standards, the O&amp;Y
account has been handled with unusual discretion.
The Canadian banks' share prices have slipped an average of about 5 per cent
in the past month. But Moody's, the US credit rating agency, said last week
O&amp;Y's problems were unlikely to precipitate a downgrading of the banks'
creditworthiness. Mr Allan Taylor, Royal Bank's chief executive, has said
Royal's exposure was not 'life-threatening'.

FT  06 APR 92 / The battle to breathe new life into Asda: The problems
facing the UK grocery chain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN THORNHILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Archie Norman, youthful chief executive of Asda, has few illusions about
the scale of problems facing the struggling Yorkshire company which forms
the UK's fourth biggest grocery chain.
'We are standing in the way of an avalanche,' he says, reflecting on his
impressions after three months in the job. 'We will lose Pounds 250m of
sales next year to Tesco and Sainsbury and we have to change our business
comprehensively.'
Mr Phil Cox, the new finance director, chips in: 'In spite of the recent
right issue, we have still got borrowings that are uncomfortably high given
how we are trading. We are still shipping water at the moment.'
Such comments summarise Asda's dilemmas: first, how to prevent the company's
financial leakage stemming from its Pounds 650m of debt; and, second, how to
develop a long-term trading strategy to ensure survival in the competitive
grocery market.
It will not be easy, as the fresh-faced team of directors admits. But if
they succeed in reviving Asda it will rank as one of the most remarkable
turnarounds in UK corporate history.
Asda's problems were not created overnight; nor can they be solved within
such a timescale. Mr Norman believes it will take three years to stabilise
the business and up to five years to achieve real results.
After leading the grocery superstore revolution in the 1970s, Asda lost its
way in the 1980s and lacked the management capability to create the
sophisticated infrastructure to support a modern food retailing operation.
The acquisition of 60 Gateway superstores for Pounds 705m in 1989, largely
financed by short-term borrowings, precipitated a financial crisis that
resulted in a Pounds 357m rights issue rescue last October.
The cash infusion eased Asda's financial strains but did not solve them. Mr
Cox says Asda cannot trade its way out of its difficulties and suggests the
company will have to look for another means of driving down debt.
This may come from the proposed flotation of MFI, the debt-ridden private
furniture chain in which Asda retains 25 per cent, or the possible sale of
Allied Maples, its home furnishings subsidiary, or the Gazeley property
business. However, it is difficult to see any ready buyers in current market
conditions.
Some Asda stores may be sold to competitors although the company is
reluctant to strengthen its rivals' hands. Without these options, Asda is
likely to make a convertible bond issue.
While there is no danger of the company going under, Mr Cox says: 'We have
to develop a three-year strategy and we have to find the financial headroom
to achieve it.'
Such financial flexibility would give Asda a chance to restore the fortunes
of its core 206-store chain. Mr Norman believes 100 of Asda's more modern
superstores can hold their own, although 50 older outlets are trading
poorly. About half a dozen are decribed as 'walking wounded' which will have
to be put out of their misery.
The Asda team has already taken action to energise its trading fortunes. A
price freeze was announced before Christmas to sharpen the company's
value-for-money image and Asda claims it is trading at price parity with its
rivals, having drifted out of line over the past few years.
The product range is also being reviewed, particularly the viability of
Asda's extensive homeware and George clothing ranges (designed by George
Davies, erstwhile head of Next). Some homeware products may be shed; even if
not they are likely to be reconfigured. 'Making people walk into our stores
through non-foods gives us a real difficulty,' says Mr Norman.
Because of its wide range, Mr Norman says shoppers spend longer in Asda's
stores than in rival chains - on average 45 minutes to an hour. He is
therefore keen to make the stores pleasant shopping environments.
Mr Norman points to human contact with customers at Asda's design-your-own
pizza counters as an example of the relationship.
The management team stresses that Asda's future lies in returning to its
heritage as the provider of the no-nonsense, good-value, weekly family shop.
Mr Allan Leighton, the marketing director recruited from Mars, says: 'Asda
is an earthy, sensible, traditional, value brand. We have to look to our
traditional customers to determine what to do rather than Sainsbury and
Tesco.'
Asda, in conjunction with McKinsey, the management consultants, is agonising
over whether to launch stores at the discount end of the market. A pilot is
promised in June with a rapid roll-out should it prove successful.
But Asda will have little time to test such formats. Every day exacerbates
its position. Analysts already expect Asda to take a write down of perhaps
Pounds 100m to Pounds 200m on the value of its Gateway stores. And its
assets are being further eroded by competitors' openings near its existing
stores.
A glimpse of the scale of the threat was provided last week by Mr David
Reid, Tesco's finance director, who told a retailing conference in London
that his company would open a further 100 stores by 1996, spending more than
Pounds 800m a year. Tomorrow Tesco is expected to announce a near-30 per
cent increase in pre-tax profits to Pounds 540m.
Mr Norman may be clutching at stores but he believes Asda is confronting the
problem which will afflict the whole sector by mid-decade: how to increase
profits from existing assets.
'We are a microcosm of what is going to happen to the whole grocery
industry. Demand growth will now slow and every year more stores will
compete head-to-head with each other. We have got to face the problem now
because we are not opening any more stores. Our watershed has just come
early,' he says.

FT  06 APR 92 / Yeltsin demands greater powers and support for reform plans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR BORIS YELTSIN, the Russian president, yesterday demanded increased powers
and support for his reform programme as he challenged his parliamentary
critics in advance of today's opening session of the Russian Congress of
Peoples' Deputies.
He used a meeting of his supporters in the Rossiya Hotel next to the Kremlin
to denounce attempts led by Mr Anatoly Sobchak, the St Petersburg mayor, to
create a parliamentary system with a figurehead president in Russia.
He said this would be 'suicide' in the present conditions of weak parties
and increasing tendencies of disintegration of the state.
'The present situation calls for a presidential republic for two or three
years . . . the government should have the right to be free in its
activities,' he told the 'Citizen's Congress', which brought together some
4,000 supporters.
Drafts of the constitution already envisage clipping Mr Yeltsin's powers by
giving deputies the right to veto by simple majority the appointment of
ministers, including the prime minister - a post he occupies.
Many deputies want to win back the veto rights which were suspended last
year at Mr Yeltsin's request.
Some deputies believe that the struggle over the constitution may end in
stalemate, with none being adopted at the end of the nine-day congress.
The meeting was picketed by around 1,000 communists and nationalists, who
jostled and threw small coins at some of those attending.
Mr Yegor Yakovklev, the head of the state television and radio network, was
pulled about and his glasses smashed, while militia looked on. The
demonstrators chanted nationalist and anti-semitic slogans, and are likely
to attempt a show of force at today's meeting of the congress, to be held in
a Kremlin hall.
Mr Yeltsin has made some changes in his government, the latest on Saturday.
He stripped Mr Alexander Shokhin of his post as labour and social security
minister, while leaving him as deputy prime minister.
Mr Yegor Gaidar, the first deputy prime minister, has lost his finance
portfolio, while Mr Genady Burbulis, the senior first deputy prime minister,
lost his seat in the cabinet. Instead, he has a role in the presidential
apparatus overseeing domestic, foreign, security and intelligence policy -
effectively deputising for Mr Yeltsin on the entire range of presidential
concerns.
Mr Yeltsin confirmed that the pace of reform would be slackened, with tax
cuts to be announced, on top of credits to industry and agriculture
amounting to Rbs200bn.
Further changes in the government were also foreshadowed, including the
co-option of 'major businessmen and industrialists' into the cabinet.
He reaffirmed his commitment to market-based change when he said: 'Only one
way out can exist today - the continuation of radical reforms.
'The main thing with which I was entrusted by the voters at the presidential
elections was to move to a normal state of life through reform. I shall not
leave this path. I believe there is no other choice today.'

<TEXT>
A WEEK from today we will have a new government, or a set of negotiations
leading to one; and this column will have changed its address. Lex will
resume its traditional Monday thoughts while this weekly dose will be found
in the financial pages, with a somewhat narrower focus. It seems a good
moment for a look back at the 16 months which made this column seem so
gloomy.
The markets in London looked quite strong, and the financial authorities
were still keeping up a complacent front. Distance sometimes lends clarity
to the view, though: the signs of strain and debt were visible enough to
anyone who had seen a property disaster close up in Texas, or examined in
the American savings banks the mud-strewn wreckage which comes to view when
a financial tidal wave recedes.
But not in the UK, I was told. British banks were thought to have kept clear
of the worst excesses of property lending. Sterling was safely pegged into a
low inflation system, and interest rates were coming down. Even now, one can
argue that the UK suffered as much from bad luck as from bad official
judgment.
It was hard to foresee what a financial mess the Germans were going to make
of reunification, and that real interest rates would therefore remain
stranded at such a punishing height.
The supervisory disasters - mainly, of course, BCCI - are the exceptions to
a reasonable record. Ordinary savers and investors still trust British
markets and institutions, which is much more than can be said in the US or
in Tokyo, to name but two.
It is no good, however, getting the details right if you get the big picture
wrong. Both the authorities and the markets took ridiculously long to
realise that debt deflation is not just an ordinary recession. Official
forecasts of recovery were regarded simply as premature rather than wrong.
But they damaged everyone who believed them - especially the ministers (who
are now scarcely on speaking terms with their advisers).
Yet the truth was being proclaimed not just by a handful of possibly
eccentric columnists and letter-writers to The Times. It was grasped early
on by the US Federal Reserve. The endless warnings of its chairman, Mr Alan
Greenspan, about a private sector credit crunch must surely have been heard
in Basle as well as on Capitol Hill.
The Fed has also shown that in the right circumstances, this problem can be
addressed through sufficiently determined easing of monetary policy. These
include a hyper-competitive exchange rate, and help from regions and close
trade partners which have reached the far side of financial disaster.
The British authorities cannot look for similar help. A really stimulative
exchange rate is not available within the ERM, even with a realignment,
should that come.
The main depression is around London, but no British region is in any
condition to play the role of Texas and its neighbours in leading the US
recovery. Britain's potential east European partners are barely at the
beginning of the road Mexico and Argentina have travelled to reach economic
break-out.
British policy has had one triumph, though at a dreadful, unforeseen cost.
Inflation, above all cost inflation, really does seem to be under control at
last. Joseph Schumpeter, who argued that the destruction wrought by economic
depressions is a creative process, would have felt vindicated. He might have
found further confirmation among the more successful survivors in the
British corporate sector, which is still achieving efficiency through
creative destruction. (Not enough, though, to support the ridiculous profit
forecasts which were holding up the market not so long ago.)
However, the markets, which ignored the bad news for so long, now ignore the
good. They have at length understood that inflation is being checked at the
expense of profits, rather than to their benefit; but they still worry that
the usual suspects - wage pressure, excessive public borrowing, or interest
rates which are 'too low' - are lurking in the scrub, waiting to ignite
inflation again. That is the message of the long bond markets.
Yet the US offers living proof that, when financial confidence is low, not
even a combination of currency depreciation, permissive monetary policy and
uncontrolled government borrowing can prevent inflation subsiding.
The danger to the economy and to profits lies rather in falling prices -
obviously in the property market, less obviously in commodities and many
goods and services. It is deflation which is undermining bank balance
sheets, raising the cost of financial intermediation when demand is weak and
eroding government revenues.
This process means that most new borrowing - whether by governments,
companies or consumers - is really distress borrowing. All these borrowers
are therefore driven to cut their spending further.
It is time, in short, to brush up on your Keynes. The Maastricht treaty will
probably prevent the UK for some time from joining the revived fashion for
Keynesian anti-recession policies; that is the penalty of joining the
country's fortunes with a group of economies that have avoided the disasters
of Anglo-Saxon lending excess.
So Britain is likely to wait for some time yet for recovery, and not just
because of the need for the other Europeans to focus their thoughts on
recession. Growth may still be difficult to arrange until the markets stop
worrying about the troubles of the 1980s.
The Japanese market is being rather more logical than the UK's. The
realisation that growth will be at best sluggish has destroyed the rationale
of traditional Japanese yields. The adjustment may look panicky, but makes
more sense than the many circulars I still read arguing that British
equities are cheap because high payouts are still being contrived - for the
time being.
But even in bad times, there are always opportunities for the wise investor.
For the immediate future, and perhaps quite a long future, these are likely
to be found only in exceptional equities, but widely in the vast supply of
bonds which will be issued in the next few years.
These raffishly volatile markets will demand all the usual arts of timing
and selection. These are some of the problems I will try to explore in the
bond pages.

FT  06 APR 92 / Finland cuts spending to avoid devaluation
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE FINNISH government promised yesterday to make significant cuts in
spending on the welfare state in an emergency package aimed at avoiding
devaluation and preventing a collapse of the centre-right coalition
government.
The proposals followed a rise in interest rates and a massive outflow of
funds on Friday after Mr Rolf Kullberg, central bank governor, resigned amid
differences with the government over who was to blame for Finland's economic
problems.
The government confirmed its commitment to low inflation, a stable exchange
rate and defending the external value of the currency in order to prevent
further loss of confidence when the financial markets open today.
The proposals had the full backing of other Nordic central banks which
pledged, if necessary, to support the Finnish markka this week.
The other Nordic countries would probably do this by lending from reserves.
The bank also announced that Ms Sirkka Hamalainen would take over from Mr
Kullberg as central bank governor immediately, not from July 1 as had been
originally proposed. The immediate appointment of Ms Hamalainen was seen as
a further step aimed at calming the markets.
After spending the weekend in emergency meetings, the government agreed to
cut expenditure by FM10bn (Pounds 1.28bn) in 1993, equivalent to 2 per cent
of GDP. The cuts should help to keep government spending within the FM 174bn
proposed limit for 1993, and are supported by the four coalition member
parties. The central bank said the measures would reduce the government's
level of indebtedness.
Cuts include limits on government funding of municipalities and reductions
in state sector pensions, unemployment payments, child benefits and overseas
aid.

FT  06 APR 92 / Cash shortages force delay in launch of venture funds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AMBITIOUS plans for a national network of regional venture capital funds
have had to be scaled down because of difficulties in raising finance.
The idea was initiated by Business in the Community, an umbrella
organisation for Britain's local enterprise agencies, which asked Midland
Bank to co-ordinate the setting up of 11 funds.
The bank now hopes that two of the projected Midland Enterprise Funds - one
in Yorkshire and another in the north of England - will be launched in May
while a further two, also in the north, will follow in June or July. Plans
for the other seven have been delayed until the fund-raising climate
improves.
Originally the aim was to raise a total of Pounds 55m to invest mainly in
small established companies, but also in start-ups. Midland would raise
Pounds 7m itself and seek the bulk of the rest from such sources as pension
funds and local authorities. Although the planned total was relatively
modest the setback to the network points to the continuing depth of the
economic recession.
There were difficulties in trying to raise finance in the south and east of
England although money was more readily available in the north, said Mr
David McMeekin, corporate finance director of Midland corporate banking.
Each regional fund should have between Pounds 3m and Pounds 6m to invest in
businesses in amounts ranging from Pounds 5,000 to Pounds 250,000. Local
professional firms will advise entrepreneurs at rates up to 60 per cent
cheaper than normal.
Midland attributes its problems in the south-east to the lack of a
well-defined regional identity and poll tax collection difficulties which
have deprived many local authorities of cash to back the venture.
The collapse of Bank of Credit &amp; Commerce International and the plundering
of pension funds in Mr Robert Maxwell's business empire have made pension
fund trustees wary of putting money into a project involving venture
capital, which some trustees regard as a slightly unorthodox means of
finance.
Some potential investors were put off by the realisation that venture
capital investments may not be as profitable as the industry forecast in the
early 1980s. Finally, many companies backed away from the project because
they have had to devote all their financial resources to surviving the
recession.
Difficulties in achieving a national spread of enterprise funds have meant
that Midland has had to drop plans for 'a fund of funds', a unit trust which
would have raised Pounds 7m centrally from institutions and then distributed
it to the regional venture funds. The money raised until now has been
returned to investors.
This leaves the fund-raisers with the Pounds 7m committed to the venture by
Midland Bank and a further Pounds 7m-Pounds 8m which has been raised from
investors in the regions.
'It is very disappointing,' said Mr McMeekin. 'But we have built a support
network of 700 professional firms in the regions and we are not going to
throw that away. As companies come out of the recession they are going to
need more capital and that has to be provided in some form.'

FT  06 APR 92 / Observer: Tie broken
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
'I'm not going to waste time scouring 16th century poetry.' So snorts
chartered accountant J L Mapley in riposte to Observer's tie-breaking
question, printed last Monday, to decide which of the 62 all-correct
entrants to the previous week's numeracy-style quiz should receive the prize
bottle of malt whisky.
The tie-breaker had two parts. The first was to show how an old problem -
which number when added to one seventh of itself equals 19? - would have
been solved by pre-algebraic methods such as the so-called 'way of
falsehood'. Part two asked which 16th-17th century English poet hinted he
understood the then new algebra, and in which poem.
The reason for the switch to matters literary was the pusillanimous one
that, as the 62 previous winners were evidently all numerate enough to solve
any calculating problem, something different was needed to break the tie.
Fortunately most of the 20 of them who (along with a dozen other readers)
had a go at the decider, did not resent the switch.
As for the tie-breaker itself, everyone solved the first part, reaching the
answer 16 5/8 . But part two produced a dilemma.
It asked specifically for the name of a '16th-17th century' English poet: ie
one who lived across the turn of those two centuries. That rules out solely
17th century poets such as Samuel Butler, cited by five entrants, and solely
16th century versifiers including Robert Recorde, cited by two.
The answer Observer had in mind, and to which the clue was the phrase 'the
way of falsehood', was John Donne in Woman's Constancy.
In it, he runs through various specious reasons his lover might voice for
ditching him. And one of them is that, since the truth is that she always
intended to be false to him, she might say she 'can have no way but
falsehood to be true.' He then goes on:
Vaine lunatique, against these scapes I could
'Dispute, and conquer, if I would . . .
In other words, he can prove that falsehood is not the only way to the
truth, because he knows how to use the way of algebra.
Alas, although eight entrants named Donne, nobody cited that particular
work. Even so, three of the previously all correct 62 cited another poem
called variously The Second Anniversarie, Of the Progresse of the Soule, and
An Anatomie of the World, which refers to 'quantities' in a way that strikes
Observer's untutored mind as basically algebraic.
So a bottle of malt each goes to those three: Dick Saunders of HM Treasury,
L Reich of Manchester, and the banking and capital markets team at Baring
Brothers.

Clearly one of the few points of agreement between Liffe and LTOM, London's
recently-married futures and equity options exchanges, was to skip the
honeymoon.
With the pre-nuptual aggro far from over, voting takes place this week for
six LTOM members to join the Liffe board. Liffe, privately dismayed at the
presence among the 13 nominees of five members from the old LTOM board,
fears the arrival of an equity options pressure group.
The options boys having failed to secure a managing director to fight their
corner, are continuing the war by other means.
Indeed, there are some surprising candidates, not least Gerald Freedman. His
Smith New Court refused to take on market-making obligations, so showing
less than total commitment to the new venture even if, as he protests, it is
still one of the most active players on the floor.
Other candidates vaunt their intimate association with the market since its
inception - hardly the most promising qualification for candidacy given
LTOM's miserable failure hitherto.
The old LTOM was a cosy club, lining the pockets of a favoured few while the
creation of a thriving com-
petitive equity options exchange went by the board. Liffe thinks too many
old faces might seek to justify that past.
Instead of arguing about who 'really understands equity options' - a claim
that could be premature for either side - the unhappy couple might consider
generating some togetherness out on the road, selling what most other
countries have found to be an eminently saleable product.

There's nothing like a lender knocking on the door to encourage secretive
entrepreneurs to open up a bit. Take Canada's Reichmann brothers whose
family firm, Olympia &amp; York, now famously needs help from its creditors.
The brothers always used to keep their cards close to their chests despite
retaining high-powered public-relations advisers. They include Sir Tim
Bell's Lowe Bell Communications in the UK, and Peter Rosenthal of
Manhattan's Howard J Rubenstein Associates in North America, with Canada's
Paul Costello also active at the Toronto hq.
Suddenly, however, there are signs of change. Last Thursday alone O&amp;Y issued
three press releases about its financial affairs, and the Reichmanns will
bare more secrets to bankers due in Toronto on April 13 to hear O&amp;Y's
debt-restructuring proposals. There's even talk of background briefings for
the media after the meeting.
Reasons for the change may include the arrival at O&amp;Y of ex-president of
Manufacturers Hanover Tom Johnson, and former Chrysler vice-chairman Steve
Miller now a partner at New York investment bank James D Wolfensohn. Among
titbits emerging from the new regime is that these days decisions are taken
collectively by Johnson, Miller, and Paul and Albert Reichmann.

FT  06 APR 92 / Pride may wreck any honourable intentions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOE ROGALY

<TEXT>
Considering what minority Labour governments have done to the Liberals on
four previous occasions, Mr Paddy Ashdown is quite right to insist that a
ring be placed on his finger before it is done again. There is just one
small problem. He may not be asked.
The leader of the Liberal Democrats may be ignored even if the result of
Britain's general election turns out to be as the opinion polls predict. The
prospect is of a parliament in which Labour holds just over 300 seats, with
the Conservatives in the 290s. Half the remaining 50 seats would be in the
Liberal Democrats' hands. In such circumstances a shameless Mr Neil Kinnock
could form a minority Labour government. He could write a Queen's Speech
that was a model of moderation. It could promise a devolved assembly for
Scotland, plus hints of other constitutional reforms, short of PR for the
Commons. Labour could then dare the other parties to vote it out. The
chances are that they would not.
Of course the electorate could yet surprise us all. The Tories might win the
largest number of seats - say, 315-plus. That is a mere handful short of
326, an overall majority. The Conservatives could then try to govern with
Ulster unionist support. They would stand a chance, for a while.
We can contemplate such an historic event if and when it takes place. For
the moment it is more pertinent to follow the polls. They say hung
parliament, Labour ahead. There have been four hung parliaments during this
century - in 1924, 1929-31, 1974 and 1976-79. In each case minority Labour
administrations have made use of the Liberals in order to gain a temporary
hold on power, then walked away. None of the governments thus shored up
performed well. The most recent of them, the Lib-Lab pact administration
under the then Mr James Callaghan, was probably the most disastrous we have
ever had to endure.
Mr Ashdown's current line, rehearsed again on television yesterday, is
therefore understandable, if cheeky. He would not wish to sustain a Labour
government under Mr Kinnock merely to be given the order of the boot once
the liaison had served its purpose. That would be foolish. A mere Lib-Lab
pact would leave the power of calling the subsequent election in Mr
Kinnock's hands. He could wait for the opportunity, spring his trap, and
return from a second campaign with a thumping majority and no need to offer
the smaller party so much as a cup of tea.
Part of the rest of Mr Ashdown's argument makes sense. Part of it is bunk.
The credible part is that a genuine coalition, cemented by an undertaking to
legislate for proportional representation, would signal to the markets and
everyone else that the new government was here to stay. There would be
stability of a sort. The bunkum is the assertion that such an arrangement
would be the verdict of the ballot box. Mr Ashdown's fifth of the electorate
would be the only segment that could be said consciously to have chosen such
an outcome. That is not a verdict. It is an accident of arithmetic.
Against that, a minority Conservative or Labour government based on 40 per
cent or less of the votes cast (and probably 30 per cent if you count
abstentions) would not represent the will of the people. It would not be
able to claim democratic legitimacy. A coalition could more convincingly do
that, provided that neither of the partners had betrayed the general
principles that they had avowed during the coalition with the Conservatives
would be a perversion. One side or the other would have to have lied to the
voters. A Lib Dem deal with Labour need not trouble the consciences of
either party. On most important areas of policy they are as close as makes
no difference; where they are apart there is room for honourable compromise.
Yet Mr Ashdown may have no need to make up his mind whether to enter a
proper coalition with Mr Kinnock. The situation may not arise. For it is Mr
Kinnock, the increasingly cocky Mr Kinnock, who would have to initiate
discussions. Would he do so? Yes, if forced to. If not, I doubt it. It all
depends upon how puffed up you think the Labour leader's vision of himself
as prime minister will be.
Let us give him the benefit of the doubt and assume that he is aware that
all previous quickies with the Liberals have ended in tears. He might then
be susceptible to the argument that if Labour wants a decent period in power
 -say 13 years - it can only do so as a result of a long-term and legitimate
alliance with the Lib Dems. On the basis of that argument he eventually
accepts electoral reform for the House of Commons even if he wins an overall
majority on Thursday.
If you buy this line, the stately progress of the debate inside Labour's
ranks becomes another clever piece of Kinnock party management. The policy
review, ending in a manifesto that is free from the word 'socialism', took
three years. The Labour leader set the party up before declaring himself in
favour of membership of the European Community. He prepared the party well
in advance of his U-turn on unilateral nuclear disarmament. The Plant
commission on voting systems could be serving a similar purpose now. It is
certainly true that there is a groundswell of Labour opinion in favour of
PR, even for the Commons.
My guess is that the latter will fade away if there is a strong Labour
showing on Thursday, giving a commanding majority of the seats in the house.
For Mr Kinnock is near to bursting with pride at his achievement, even
before it is proven. Once he becomes prime minister, he is unlikely to want
to share power with another party, whatever the long-term logic of such an
arrangement may be.
More to the point, he seems to be telling himself that he can create a grand
coalition of the left within the Labour movement. You could certainly deduce
this from his many references over the past few days to consensus and
government so wise that everyone will want to support it. Think about the
numbers. Labour needs just a quarter of the Liberal Democrat vote added to
its own to command the support of 45 per cent of British voters - enough, if
it holds, to sustain smashing majorities in a series of first-past-the-post
elections.
There is a lesson for potential prime ministers who are inclined to think
that way. It is contained in the history of the past 13 years. Two or three
easy victories based on the ideology of a single party do not end happily.
Inflated pride is followed by a great fall. The achievements of such an
administration may be blown away in the wind. Mr Kinnock could seek to
deceive the Liberals, representative of at least a fifth of the people, into
submission, or he could ignore them. The latter is particularly tempting to
those who cannot stomach what they regard as Mr Ashdown's sanctimonious
posturing. But neither route will produce a centre-left alliance that could,
in the 21st century, match the Conservatives' record of election victories
in the 20th.

<TEXT>
'I HAVE a great capacity for resisting imperatives,' President Francois
Mitterrand quipped at the height of the French political crisis last week.
In the event, the imperatives proved too strong even for as inventive a
political acrobat as Mr Mitterrand. However much the President may have
disliked it, the replacement of the outspoken and unpopular Mrs Edith
Cresson could hardly have been avoided after the disastrous performance of
the Socialist Party in the regional elections.
Mr Mitterrand's hesitations in choosing her successor are more
understandable. No doubt, he would have preferred to have nominated Mr
Jacques Delors, the European Commission President. That would have provided
the government with the new blood it desperately needs, while in no way
undermining its image of economic rectitude. However, with an eye on his own
presidential ambitions in 1995, Mr Delors understandably declined to be
associated with a discredited regime.
The President's eventual choice as new Prime Minister, Mr Pierre Beregovoy,
has a justified reputation as a successful manager of the French economy.
Thanks to rigorous fiscal policies, he has brought down inflation to 3 per
cent, lower than that of any of France's European Community partners, while
achieving a growth rate still expected to reach about 2 per cent this year.
But whereas he is certainly the businessman's and financial markets' choice,
it is doubtful whether he can turn himself into a really popular leader,
able to reverse the anti-Socialist trend, before next year's parliamentary
elections.
That task will be made all the more difficult by the fact that he has little
room for manoeuvre. Mrs Cresson's controversial personality was not the only
reason for her government's unpopularity. Her administration was, above all,
identified with high unemployment, well above the European average at nearly
10 per cent, ironically the result of Mr Beregovoy's policies and not her
own. To find an effective solution to this and other social problems, while
maintaining a tight fiscal and monetary stance aimed at reducing inflation
and keeping the franc stable in the European exchange rate mechanism, will
tax the new Prime Minister's economic management skills.
No radical change of direction can therefore be expected from Mr Beregovoy,
who remains in overall charge of economic policy, as underlined by the
cosmetic appointment of a much younger, but economically inexperienced, new
Finance Minister, Mr Michel Sapin. The attempt to balance the Socialist old
guard with less conventional government ministers such as Mr Jack Lang and
Mr Bernard Tapie, the flamboyant entrepreneur, is unlikely to do much, if
anything, to enhance the government's credibility.
The underlying reason for the present regime's lack of support resides in
the erosion of confidence in President Mitterrand himself, now in his 11th
year of office. Unless Mr Mitterrand goes ahead later this year with planned
constitutional reforms which will reduce the presidential term from seven to
five years, and apply the new rules to himself, it seems improbable that,
even with a reshuffled government, the Socialists can turn the tide.

FT  06 APR 92 / Leading Article: Tenants squeezed
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A GROWING number of tenants in England, among them companies both large and
small, is falling foul of a law governing the assignment of leases on
properties. During the recession the law is causing arbitrary injustice
which ought to be remedied by the next government. Under English, but not
Scottish, law a tenant can be held liable for unpaid rent owed by any
subsequent tenant to whom the lease is assigned.
In more prosperous times this caused few difficulties because tenants were
generally able to keep up rental payments and landlords could easily find
new tenants. Now, the recession in the UK property market has made it easier
for tenants to negotiate a rent 'holiday' or leases shorter than the
standard 25 years. But it has also pushed more and more businesses into
difficulty, and landlords have increasingly enforced the liability clause.
For example, a retired grocery shop owner received a demand for more than
Pounds 50,000 six years after selling his business. A larger company which
leased offices in central London between 1985 and 1987 at a rent of Pounds
355,000 a year was faced with a claim of Pounds 800,000.
The institutions which invest in property argue that 25-year leases and
assignors' liability clauses are required to guarantee the long-term returns
they need to match their long-term obligations. But the absence of this
security does not appear to have restrained investors outside England.
Many tenants would prefer an adjustment to rent levels to compensate
landlords for any reduction in the attractiveness of rented property as an
investment. Rents, unlike the liability clauses, are at least subject to
market pressures.
Little can be done to help tenants now facing demands arising from rent
defaults. But a fairer balance needs to be established in future. The next
government should look urgently at proposals drawn up in 1988 by the Law
Commission.
The commission called for tenants' liability to end when they assign a lease
to their successors, although in certain circumstances a landlord would be
able to seek guarantees for his immediate successor. This might lead to
landlords making more frequent use of their right to reject a potential
assignee, which could appear to reduce the flexibility of the property
market. But 25-year leases with a continuing liability are even more
powerful restraints on market flexibility.
The demands of fairness and the economic benefits of making the property
market more responsive to the needs of tenants both argue for speedy action
to change the law.

FT  06 APR 92 / The changing fax of life: An industry's strategic shift
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is already late in the evening and you have only just finished putting
together the action plan for tomorrow's annual meeting. Branch managers
scattered throughout the country are waiting anxiously for their copies to
be faxed to them.
No need to panic. Just call up the national branch map on your computer
screen and press the auto-dialling button. Within minutes your managers will
have easy-to-read plain paper copies of the crucial document on their desks,
complete with colour graphs.
Such technology is one example of a new wave of fax products aimed at
integrating the machine into office and home electronics.
For the fax industry, the success of the new generation is a matter of
survival. Like other areas of electronics the fax is suffering from stagnant
growth. The US and Japanese markets peaked in 1990, and the UK also faces
saturation. All British companies with more than 1,000 employees and 70 per
cent of those with fewer than 100 had faxes by 1990, according to market
research company BIS Strategic Decisions.
Saturation of markets has combined with intense competition and recession to
prompt a price war. A basic fax machine which cost businesses Pounds 4,000
in 1986 can now be bought for about Pounds 400, says Mr Tomio Komine,
general manager of the fax marketing department at Canon in the UK.
'Prices have been dropping like crazy,' says Mr Jeffrey Goldberg, industry
analyst at Dataquest, the market research company. 'Nobody's making money
from fax machines as far as I can tell.'
Not surprisingly, there have been casualties. In Europe, Alcatel, the
leading French telecommunications group, recently announced that it would
stop making fax machines at its own factories because of the fall in prices
and margins.
Alcatel's withdrawal leaves the industry even more concentrated in Japanese
hands. The largest manufacturers of fax machines are all Japanese, with
Canon, Matsushita, Sharp and Ricoh achieving the largest international
sales. Even Xerox, the US company which brought the world the first
commercial fax machine, manufactures its faxes almost entirely through Fuji
Xerox, its Japanese subsidiary.
But the Japanese, too, are now suffering. Their response has been to invest
heavily to develop products with sufficient advantages over older models to
spark demand and justify premium prices.
The greatest hope over the next few years lies in plain paper faxes, which
use ink jet sprays or laser-printed normal paper rather than the shiny,
flimsy thermal paper which is universally disliked. BIS expects annual sales
of plain paper faxes in the US to grow from Dollars 28bn in 1990 to Dollars
93bn this year.
However, prices of plain paper machines are expected to fall sharply by the
end of this year as more vendors introduce competing models. The price of a
top-of-the-range machine, for example, is forecast to drop from about
Dollars 2,500 to Dollars 2,000, according to BIS.
Multi-functional fax machines - integrated with printers, scanners and
photocopiers - also hold out the hope of better profits.
The growing trend to integrate the fax with the PC, however, could represent
a threat to all stand-alone faxes and their manufacturers. The fall in
prices of PC modems, which enable PC users to send faxes straight off their
computer screens, has accelerated the development of such rival systems. 'As
more and more people become computer literate, they will want to avoid the
inconvenience of having to stand up from their terminal,' says Jennie Lewis,
senior analyst at BIS.
If the shift to integration takes off, the fax industry could be looking
increasingly at the non-business user for growth. The combined fax and
answering machine is likely to be the main spur to home demand.
Manufacturers looking further into the future also talk of integrating a fax
capability in mobile phones.
In Japan, where machines small enough to fit under the telephone are
becoming popular, it is fashionable to have a fax machine at home. Japanese
schoolchildren are already sending homework to each other via the fax.
The popularity among younger consumers could spread if Swatch, the Swiss
group that makes 'disposable' watches, comes out with a fax machine, as
promised.
There are already signs that prices of household fax machines are falling
even before the residential market has fully developed. If, as expected,
such price cuts materialise, the fax-cum-answering machine could rival the
videophone as the next yuppie gadget.

FT  06 APR 92 / Leading Article: A protest vote in Germany
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR 40 post-war years, successive West German chancellors have been able to
count on almost automatic support from domestic public opinion for policies
aimed at extending west European integration. That era of comfortable
certainty has now come to an end. For German voters, the kind of Europe
which Chancellor Helmut Kohl signed up to deliver at Maastricht four months
ago appears to be increasingly unpopular. There are deep implications for
the new governments taking shape in Paris, London and Rome.
Because united Germany is Europe's pivotal power, Europe will move forward
only at the pace to which Germany agrees. The Maastricht blueprint for a
united Europe was condemned by many Euro-federalists as being too
half-hearted. But in the area of chief German concern - establishing a firm
timetable for proceeding to economic and monetary union - the Maastricht
programme may prove to be too ambitious.
Yesterday's protest vote against Mr Kohl's Christian Democrats in two
important regional elections was not, of course, simply a sign of
dissatisfaction with Europe. The outcome was a signal of the general
political strains caused by German unification. In Baden-Wurttemberg,
disquiet about record numbers of immigrants seeking asylum was an important
factor behind the improved showing of the far right. Yet a general reason
for the anti-CDU swing was undoubtedly disquiet that, at Maastricht, Mr Kohl
made a commitment towards eventually abandoning the D-Mark - without
securing agreement for anything approaching political union across what
would become a unified European currency area.
Mr Kohl and his advisers have been taken aback by the emotional German
debate over the consequences of Maastricht. While keeping to his overall
pro-European rhetoric, the chancellor is now likely to use every means
available to ensure that the hurdles for proceeding to monetary union will
be as tough as possible.
The decisive factor will be whether the Bonn government makes a success of
the economic integration of the two parts of Germany. The large fiscal
deficits caused by the need for enormous public sector transfers from west
to east Germany will be neither politically nor economically tenable for
much longer.
If the Bundesbank is called upon semi-permanently to bear too large a share
of the burden of keeping inflation under control, prolonged high German
interest rates may lead to several years of slow growth throughout the whole
of Europe. Even the few EC countries that are trying hard to keep their
budget deficits under control would then find it difficult to achieve the
targets set down at Maastricht.
Mr Kohl always stresses that German unity and European unity are 'two sides
of the same coin'. Now, both sides of the coin are starting to look
tarnished at once. The German chancellor bears the main responsibility for
seeking to restore the shine.

FT  06 APR 92 / So far, so good - but so fragile: There are hopes for
Russia's economic progress, but only a few
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The progress of Russian economic reform is as fragile as the first strand of
a spider's web. It can so easily be destroyed, and perhaps will be as early
as this week, when the Sixth Congress of Russian Peoples' deputies meets to
debate where Russia now stands.
The announcement last week of a Dollars 24bn aid package from the Group of
Seven countries was timed to bolster reform with proof of western
intentions: 'a decisive signal of political and economic support', according
to Mr Helmut Kohl, the German chancellor. A signal it is, but not decisive:
western aid, even on a large scale, is marginal so long as the economy, and
the main actors within it, do not respond to the new climate that the
government is struggling to create.
For those, inside and outside Russia who wish for its success, there is
little to say that is optimistic. But there are some important signs of
hope.
The economic strategists within the Russian cabinet, headed by Mr Yegor
Gaidar (now clipped of his finance portfolio), are committed reformers - the
first and so far the only group of this kind to emerge from under the rubble
of the Soviet Union. However they arrived at their present liberalism, they
hold to it strongly - so strongly that even orthodox western economists
murmur that they are over-rigid. Unlike earlier economic reformers who could
not, or were never given the chance to, reform, they pursue change without
falter or excuse.
They have liberalised most of the prices of commodities, and intend to raise
energy prices soon, grasping a stinging nettle where previous
administrations under Mr Mikhail Gorbachev had only gingerly tugged at it.
In so doing, they have established the essential precondition for market
relations and cut into the vast 'rouble overhang' of unspendable roubles in
banks or below the bed.
The Russian Central Bank has stemmed the flow of the automatic credit
extended to enterprises - with the result that these latter have racked up
more than Rbs600bn of unpaid bills and loans, and are screaming to be bailed
out. Mr Gaidar held out for more than two months: 'Our policy of
restructuring is aimed precisely at denying credits to those who should be
thrown on to the market as quickly as possible,' he said in a recent
interview. He will have to loosen now: credits of between Rbs100bn and
Rbs200bn are already agreed for agriculture and industry. But he said last
week: 'None of this means a retreat.'
Last week, the Gaidar team scored a notable success in persuading the
International Monetary Fund's executive board to admit Russia into
membership with a quota of 3 per cent, thus allowing it to borrow up to
Dollars 4bn when it becomes a member - probably at the end of this month.
The IMF had been originally minded to keep them to a level of 2.5 per cent,
and the extra half a percentage point means much in terms of prestige, if
less in terms of resources.
Most importantly for their own survival, they have so far had the solid
support of Mr Boris Yeltsin, the Russian president and the central prop of
its politics - a support he repeated yesterday in a speech to followers.
Mr Yeltsin is always described as a populist: certainly, he is piling the
pressure on his cabinet to deliver something tangible in the way of a better
life. But, so far, he has not criticised them in public: in contrast, he has
openly patronised his carping, nationalist-inclined deputy, Mr Alexander
Rutskoi, who had set himself up as a foe of 'Gaidarism'.
So far, so good: but so good, so precarious. The indicators remain
stubbornly awful. The government's own forecasting unit expects production
to drop further, between 25 and 30 per cent this year: oil production to go
down by 14 per cent, or 64m tonnes. Mr Gaidar himself predicts 6m unemployed
in the same period. The forecasting unit expects prices to go up by 10 or 11
times by the end of this year over the previous one. Hard currency of about
Dollars 20bn has fled the country, leaving the Russian government - and the
other post-Soviet states - with almost none. Western bankers and governments
are resigned to not receiving any of the principal due on the Dollars 70bn
foreign debt of the former Soviet Union for up to a decade - and are
presently not receiving any interest, either.
The nature of the crisis, however, is deeper than that: it is embedded in
the structure of the society and the economy which the Russian government,
like its counterparts all over the former Soviet empire, have inherited.
Here, little has been done - either in the six years of Mr Gorbachev's
perestroika, or in the three months of an independent Russian power.
The banks and the fledgling stock markets (on which very few stocks are
traded) remain hopelessly weak and dependent. Only some 20 banks are
licensed to conduct foreign currency transactions and do so in (by
international standards) small volumes. Roubles can be converted into hard
currency and vice versa at market rates - but only at certain times, and in
certain places. Even internal convertibility seems a distant dream.
Nearly all property remains a monopoly of one or other level of the state.
Privatisation is barely started: so far it generally comprises managers or
workers or both together taking over the assets of the enterprise or shop in
which they work with or without the permission of the nominal authorities.
Mrs Elena Kotova, head of privatisation at Moscow City Council, resigned
earlier this week, saying: 'It was pointless simply rubber stamping this
process and calling it privatisation.'
Privatisation by sale is unpopular: most people see it as the rich or the
criminal (no strong distinction is made) getting their hands on property -
indisputably true, in the short run. Thus the voices against the creation of
capitalists are strong, and take on increasing moral force: Dr Boris
Kurashvili, a juridical expert, told a meeting of the Russian Academy of
Sciences last week that 'the basis of a market economy must be collective
enterprises - for which state property should be transferred to the
workers'. It will take a lot of political will to push through genuine
privatisation, and to face down the complaints of the majority of
non-owners.
However, no one believes that the large companies, responsible for the bulk
of production, will soon be privatised on any system: and the heads of these
 -as Mr Gaidar noted - stubbornly refuse to act in a market fashion. They
have very large inventories on which they have put very high prices: rather
than pull down their prices to get sales, they sit on the inventories and
beg for cash.
'They do not believe the present economic reform will last,' says Mr
Alexander Ruptsov, a consultant and member of the newly created Presidential
Council of Entrepreneurs. 'They just carry on in the old way. If this goes
on for just a little longer, there will be huge redundancies.'
The manoeuvres the government is now making have been forced upon it by an
unbeatable coalition of forces. Powerful voices, which claim still to
support the government and whose support it needs, have been raised in the
past week to say: enough.
Mr Arkady Volsky, head of the Russian Union of Industrialists and Professor
Yevgeny Yasin, his chief economist, have both made clear that more credit
must be made available to their members. Mr Yeltsin, who has long tried to
get Mr Volsky inside his tent but has so far failed, had to take heed: Mr
Gaidar, against his wishes, had to relax his severity.
This may be no more than a sensible manoeuvre in the face of opposition
which cannot be faced down and social consequences which cannot be
tolerated. Or it may be the first slither on a slope which spirals down to
hyperinflation and industrial stasis. In either case, the view that market
reform is a long drawn-out affair, during which a step forward will be
succeeded by a stride backwards, is becoming common currency between the
ever-widening circle of western experts and the reformers.
'Don't take the market too seriously: none of us in the west do' is the
(rather confusing) message now being insinuated into the policy debate, most
recently by a group of distinguished social scientists who spent many hours
with the senior figures in the Russian government. The problem, say the
western experts in their hotel dining rooms in the evenings, is that these
people do not know real markets, only what the textbooks say.
Finally, the sheer scale of modernisation required by this economy is
staggering. Mr David Roche, the director of global strategy at Morgan
Stanley International, recently calculated that if a reform programme were
not to be abandoned mid-stream for lack of funds (worse than not being
attempted), the west would need to supply each year: Dollars 18bn-Dollars
30bn in direct aid; Dollars 15bn-Dollars 50bn in rebuilding infrastructure,
particularly transport; Dollars 25bn-Dollars 45bn to the energy industry to
stabilise output (especially of oil); Dollars 5bn-Dollars 15bn on the
modernisation of power stations; Dollars 5bn-Dollars 10bn on agriculture and
distribution; Dollars 5bn-Dollars 10bn on training and welfare payments to
the unemployed; and Dollars 3bn-Dollars 7bn on supplying consumer goods.
This excludes money for the cleaning up of the polluted environment, and for
rouble stabilisation: the total hovers somewhere between Dollars 76bn and
Dollars 167bn a year.
Utopian? Probably. Having announced Dollars 24bn, most politicians in the
west will think they have done enough for some time. But, as Mr Roche says,
foreign private capital is actually leaving, not coming to, Russia: the
failure of Vnesheconombank, the foreign affairs bank, has cut off any
further hard currency loans.
If the west is to stay engaged, the bill will rise: if it does not pay it,
say the experts, there will be one or other kind of explosion which will
wreck the 'common home' of which Mr Gorbachev used to speak in his lyrical
moments.
This has echoes of a vast blackmail: 'Nice world you've got: pity if the
Russians were to wreck it.' But they possess the potential to do just that:

FT  06 APR 92 / Arts: Businesses in league with art - Sponsorship
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'We would not do it if it was not in our business interests' says Lord
Young, chairman of Cable and Wireless. Few leading businessmen are so
categorical about why they support the arts; yet this hard-headed approach
may be better for the long term future of sponsorship than transient
do-goodism.
Cable and Wireless invests sparingly under its corporate name, but with a
splash. It took Ashkenasy back to the Soviet Union; it brought the Chinese
ballet to Sadler's Wells. With both countries it has extensive potential
dealings which were nurtured through these arts contacts. Last week it
helped finance the visit of the English National Ballet to Hungary.
The evening in Budapest was a highly successful occasion. The patron of the
ENB, the Princess of Wales, was there, which was a tremendous PR bonus; the
audience was ecstatic about the performance; and all the right people from
the Hungarian government attended. Cable and Wireless is part of a
consortium seeking a contract running into many hundred millions of dollars
to modernise Hungary's telecommunications. The direct cost of the
sponsorship was only Pounds 35,000, although essential extras lifted this to
a still reasonable Pounds 50,000.
While sponsorship in the UK faces a difficult time, many companies are
following Cable and Wireless in pursuing overseas export objectives with the
help of the arts. The British Council acts as a not disinterested pump
primer and persuaded companies to contribute Pounds 5.5m towards sponsorship
initiatives abroad in the financial year that ended last week. Almost two
thirds of this went into arts activities: the rest into training and
education projects. That was comfortably above target and compares with the
Pounds 3.83m brought in during 1990-91.
The idea is that the British Council comes up with some cash while business
supplies the rest, and more. For 1992-93 it has set itself a target of
Pounds 5.8m but so far the response has been encouraging. Glaxo has come up
with Pounds 150,000 to make possible an exhibition of sculpture by Anthony
Caro in the Trajan markets in Rome in May, while a raft of companies,
including British Steel and, would you believe it, the notoriously tight
fisted GEC, are contributing Pounds 170,000 towards a Henry Moore exhibition
in Paris at the same time.
Other sponsorships on line include Chartered West helping the Halle to tour
Argentina and Brazil, while Marks and Spencer has added Pounds 30,000 to its
original Pounds 60,000 to take a revamped version of the British fashion
show All Dressed Up, to the Far East.
Not every project succeeds. No sponsor could be found for the CBSO's tour of
the US, so the British Council was forced to up its contribution while the
artists, and their agents, including conductor Simon Rattle, took a cut in
fees.
The plight of arts sponsorship in the UK in 1992 was well summed up by Bob
Horton of BP at the BP Arts Journalism Awards ceremony this week. The
recession, and withering criticism of sponsorship by some commentators, is
stripping away corporate support for the arts. BP, traditionally one of the
biggest sponsors, has been forced to reduce its budget from Pounds 1.2m in
1991 to Pounds 940,000 this year.
What upset Bob Horton most is the entrenched hatred of sponsors by certain
critics. Sponsors seem to be remarkably thin skinned in their reaction to
such attacks but then they still have to justify their expenditure to
Philistine directors inside companies. It suggests that sponsorship still
has a superficial hold in many boardrooms.
Against the trend Digital, which has concentrated most of its marketing
expenditure on sponsorship and, in particular dance, for the past six years,
last week announced a 10 per cent increase in its 1992-93 budget to Pounds
550,000. Among the ventures are the financing of two new productions, A
Christmas Carol by the Northern Ballet Theatre and Cinderella by English
National Ballet.
ENB has announced that it exceeded its 1991-92 sponsorship target by Pounds
250,000. It looked for Pounds 340,000 and brought in Pounds 590,000. It
expects things to be tougher in this financial year, but with 80 per cent of
its backers, including Digital and NatWest, continuing to support the
company, it is confident of reaching a modest target of Pounds 400,000.
Next weekend sees the climax of the BBC's first and most successful
flirtation with outside sponsorship, the broadcast final of Young Musician
of the Year competition in association with Lloyds Bank. The bank has
committed Pounds 1.3m to the project during five years but is more than
happy with its investment, especially the 5m audience expected for next
Saturday night.
The fact that the competition takes place every two years enables it to feed
in additional packages, which will be highlighted in self-contained features
during the three hour transmission. This season it added a Lloyds Bank Young
Composer competition and a Lloyds Bank Fashion Challenge; the challenge
being for young designers to devise comfortable clothes for the finalists to
wear. This fitted in neatly with Lloyds sponsorship of a fashion award,
which also gets TV coverage.
The BBC has had second thoughts about its biggest potential arts tie up. It
has dropped its search for a sponsor prepared to put up Pounds 2m to be
linked to the Proms. It was not because of a lack of enquiries: rather a
decision by the BBC's new director general John Birt, who does not want the
flagship Proms to be 'sold' to outside interests.
Audi is backing the newly formed London Philharmonic Youth Orchestra with
Pounds 160,000 during three years. The 60-strong ensemble of musicians aged
between 17 and 23 will perform at least nine concerts each year.

FT  06 APR 92 / Lloyd's in talks on share of award
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A GROUP of Lloyd's Names who are members of loss-making catastrophe
reinsurance and Outhwaite syndicates may soon be in another dispute with the
market's authorities.
It is understood that talks between Lloyd's and representatives of the
affected Names - individuals whose personal wealth underpins insurance
business - started on Friday and have not yet been concluded.
As members of the Outhwaite syndicate in 1982 they won an out-of-court
settlement this February of Pounds 116m.
They are seeking to avoid payment of claims this year and believe evidence
presented to the commercial court last week alleging irregularities in the
management of Gooda Walker syndicates has strengthened their case.
The bulk of the Pounds 116m was to be funded by 'errors and omissions' (E&amp;O)
policies. E&amp;O insurance is taken out by agencies and covers legal awards
against syndicate managers.
Some Names, who are taking action over Gooda, now claim that Lloyd's is
seeking to withhold the money due to them from the Outhwaite settlement.
Lloyd's last night said discussions were taking place 'about the status of
the monies involved in the settlement, and in particular the relation to the
Names who are party to the (Outhwaite) agreement who have unfunded
underwriting losses.'
It added: 'It is not a matter of Lloyd's seeking to withhold these funds.
Rather, it is seeking to ensure that where Names have obligations to
policyholders, those funds are available. Our concern is to ensure that each
underwriting member is in a position to meet his underwriting obligations.'

FT  06 APR 92 / Diesel share of car sales grows
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AMID the gloom of the UK new-car market, diesel cars have emerged as one of
the few growth segments in the prolonged recession.
Demand for diesel cars has continued to rise, in sharp contrast to the steep
fall in overall new-car sales. The share captured by diesel-engined cars has
doubled in the past two years.
Figures from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders show that the
diesel share of the UK new-car market jumped to a record 11.2 per cent in
the first two months this year from 8.8 per cent in the whole of last year
and only 4.6 per cent in 1988.
According to leading car producers, demand has been boosted by the
introduction of diesel cars that can match the performance and refinement of
similar petrol-engined models.
Significant progress has been achieved in both diesel-engine and fuel
technology, and those advances have been added to the traditional
attractions of diesel cars, such as fuel economy - diesel cars use about 20
per cent less fuel than petrol-engined cars - higher second-hand values, and
greater durability and reliability.
Diesel cars have also started to make a significant breakthrough in the
company-car sector. Measures signalled in the Budget might bring a further
boost to diesel demand if the promised reforms of the system for taxing
company-car benefits are imple-mented.
Changes in fuel duty in the Budget have already widened the favourable
differential between diesel and leaded petrol prices.
In the two years since 1989, sales of new diesel cars in the UK have risen
by 13.3 per cent from 123,345 in 1989 to 139,810 last year. In the same
period, overall new car sales have fallen by 30.8 per cent from a record
2.3m in 1989 to only 1.59m last year.
Peugeot, the French carmaker which includes Citroen, has made the biggest
gains, and the new-found popularity of diesel cars is having a significant
effect on other carmakers in the UK new-car market.
With its combined Peugeot and Citroen marques, the French carmaker accounted
for 43.5 per cent of all diesel cars sold in the UK last year. It also
supplies diesel engines to Rover, the British Aerospace subsidiary, for its
Rover 200/400 series.
The Peugeot brand alone boosted its share of the diesel new-car market to
31.2 per cent last year from 25.2 per cent in 1990 and accounted for three
of the five best-selling diesel cars in the UK.
The big jump in UK diesel car sales is bringing the British market more into
conformity with sales patterns in leading Continental markets.

FT  06 APR 92 / Auditing dominated by six firms in Europe, says study
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIX international accountancy firms dominate audit work among Europe's top
companies and enjoy almost complete control over the sector in three EC
countries, according to a study for the European Commission.
The report, conducted by National Economic Research Associates (Nera) for
Brussels' competition directorate, says the international networks of the
'Big Six' firms in Europe - largest by fee income and staff - audit almost
100 per cent of the top 200 businesses in Belgium, Italy and the
Netherlands.
The firms - KPMG, Coopers &amp; Lybrand, Ernst &amp; Young, Arthur Andersen, Price
Waterhouse and Deloitte Ross Tohmatsu - also control more than half the
audit work in Germany and Portugal.
Nera says large accountancy firms rely on audit clients to generate
substantial fee income from other activities, although there appears to be a
high degree of client satisfaction with the present position.
The report was commissioned in 1989 at a time of serious concern about the
competitive consequences of the rapid growth of accountancy services, the
merger of several firms and the development of international networks.
The study, to be released next month, identifies a 'second tier' of
medium-sized firms, including BDO, Grant Thornton International, Howarth &amp;
Howarth, CLG/Clark Whitehill, Robson Rhodes, Pannel Kerr Forster, Moore
Stephens, Moores &amp; Rowland, Neville Russell International and Spicer &amp;
Oppenheim.
Nera explains the dominance of the Big Six by saying that large companies
need to draw on accountants with considerable resources, international
contacts and a perceived higher level of quality.
The study shows rapid fee income growth in all the firms from 1984 to 1989.
Audit and accounting fees have declined as a proportion of the total in
every country, to be replaced principally by management consulting and tax
advice, which are perceived by the firms as more profitable.
It shows the firms as significantly reliant on audit clients for fee income
from those other sources. Proportions ranged between 9 per cent in France
and 44 per cent in Ireland - and Nera says the figures are likely to be
underestimates.
Overall, 35 per cent cent of businesses did not employ any accounting firms
other than their auditor and more than half gave at least 80 per cent of
accounting-related fees to the auditor.
The report suggests this is explained by cost savings contributed by the
inside knowledge of a company an auditor has built up and the reputation
gained from audit work.
It says restrictions to prevent auditors from conducting other work for the
same client in France, Italy and Portugal are 'not always matched by their
effect' because 'related and interlocking firms' have been created to
circumvent the rules.
It found little evidence that these arrangements were anti-competitive or
caused dissatisfaction among clients, but emphasised that they had
implications for the independence of auditors.
In a separate section, the study concludes that there is little evidence of
genuinely international firms rather than networks that share resources.
National practices appear to be 'insulated' from one another, as illustrated
by wide variations in hourly staff charge-out rates.
In 1989, Big Six partner fees varied between Ecu 120 in Greece and Ecu 248
in the UK. For medium-sized firms it ranged from Ecu 73 in Belgium to Ecu
184 in the UK. For newly qualified staff, hourly rates varied between Ecu 30
in Portugal and Ecu 89 in Denmark for Big Six firms, and between Ecu 32 in
Spain and Ecu 82 in Denmark for medium-sized firms.
The study argues that the main advantages of the international networks of
firms are to permit referral of work, and to generate a powerful shared
marketing image. Co-ordination between fellow firms in different countries
also gives rise to common standards and techniques, and allows for staff
secondments.
Few foreign firms are involved in audit and likely to threaten other members
of the same international network. They are impeded by legal factors,
professional restrictions and the existing conduct of international
networks.
'We would doubt that the competitive behaviour of accounting firms located
in one member state is constrained by the existence of the competitive
threat from those located in another,' it says. 'The barriers to intra-EC
trade . . . are substantial.'

FT  06 APR 92 / Cricket boosts dish sales: FT SatellLte Monitor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INTEREST in World Cup cricket led to a surge in satellite dish sales in
March, taking the total of homes with satellite television to just under
2.4m - one in nine households, Raymond Snoddy writes.
According to the FT Satellite Monitor, the number of new installations rose
from 78,000 in February to 94,000 in March, taking the total to 2.372m.
Mr John Clemens, chairman of Continental Research, the market research
company that produces the monitor, said: 'Sports, and maybe getting away
from over-exposure to election broadcasts, made March another remarkable
month for dish sales.'
There are 1m more dishes in place than 12 months ago and the number of
people saying they would get satellite television is also increasing.
A year ago, 1.4m homes had dishes and a further 2.1m people said they would
definitely or probably install a dish. Now a further 2.2m are interested in
satellite television, with 289,000 saying they definitely will get a dish
and 1.88m saying they probably will.

FT  06 APR 92 / Law firms turn to litigation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE, Legal Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LITIGATION overtook conveyancing as the chief source of revenue for
provincial law firms last year for the first time, according to figures from
the Centre for Interfirm Comparison. The shift reflects the depressed state
of the housing market.
The centre, which carries out an annual comparative performance project
among 260 law firms nationally, found that overall, law firms' revenues in
England and Wales continued to grow. The average revenue growth rate was
15.9 per cent for provincial firms and 17.7 per cent for London firms.
Litigation grew steadily in all regions of the country - by more than 35 per
cent on average in the provinces and by almost 30 per cent in London.
Traditionally, the profession derived about 45 per cent of its revenue from
conveyancing. Last year it accounted for only 32 per cent on average.
The profitability of most firms fell last year. Median net profit per
partner in the north fell from Pounds 33,500 in 1990 to Pounds 21,500 in
1991 and from Pounds 98,000 to Pounds 97,400 in London. In the south-east
profit per partner rose from Pounds 29,000 to Pounds 30,100. Profits were
calculated after deducting a notional salary for partners of Pounds 45,000
in London and Pounds 30,000 elsewhere.

FT  06 APR 92 / Researchers favour Labour economic plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A LABOUR victory in Thursday's general election would boost UK growth
prospects over the next two years, cutting the jobless total by up to
70,000, according to two forecasts published today by independent research
groups.
The forecasts - from the London Business School and the Ernst &amp; Young Item
Club - say the effect of higher interest rates that are likely after a
Labour win would be outweighed by more expansionary economic policies.
Although unemployment is likely to be lower by an average of up to 70,000
over the next two years under Labour rather than the Conservatives,
inflation and the public-sector borrowing requirement (PSBR) would probably
be higher.
According to the LBS, the economy would expand by 1.5 per cent this year
under Labour, compared with 1.2 per cent under the Conservatives. That would
be followed by 2.8 per cent growth next year under Labour, or 2.5 per cent
under the Tories.
Item, a panel of economists that bases its forecasts on the Treasury's
computerised economic model, says Labour would preside over growth of 0.5
per cent and 1.9 per cent this year and next, compared with 0.4 per cent and
1.8 per cent for the Conservatives.
According to Item, a coalition government of Labour and the Liberal
Democrats would lead to growth this year of 0.7 per cent, higher than for
either a Labour or Tory administration governing on its own. Most of the
higher growth would be due to extra tax-financed public spending.
The LBS foresees unemployment under Labour this year and next averaging
2.64m, 70,000 less than the average figure under the Tories of 2.71m. Item
says the average under Labour would be 2.87m, 50,000 less than the figure
for the Conservatives of 2.92m.
The forecasters base their calculations on proposals outlined by Mr John
Smith, the shadow chancellor, as against the effect of continued Tory
policies.
According to the LBS, under Labour the retail prices index would grow by 4.6
per cent this year and 3.7 per cent next, compared with 4.4 per cent and 3.6
per cent under the Conservatives. Item puts those numbers at 3.9 per cent
and 3.3 per cent, and 3.7 per cent and 2.2 per cent.

<TEXT>
THE Miss World beauty contest, in exile from its native Britain after being
shunned by television schedulers, has found a new home at Sun City, the
South African hotel and entertainment resort, Michael Skapinker writes.
Mr Sol Kerzner, Sun City's founder and former husband of Miss Anneline
Kriel, a former Miss World, intends to use the internationally televised
contest to attract visitors to Lost City, a new Pounds 150m adjunct to Sun
City.
Located in the arid, nominally independent homeland of Bophuthatswana, many
miles from the nearest ocean, Lost City will feature 'the world's first
man-made rain forest' and a pool with 2 1/2 -metre-high surfing waves. Miss
World will take place in November, shortly before Lost City's opening.
Although Britain's terrestrial television channels no longer regard Miss
World as appropriate family viewing, Mr Kerzner says he expects the
competition to be broadcast to 600m people worldwide.

FT  06 APR 92 / Voluntary control to be urged by Cadbury
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CONCERN that government may impose restrictions on the activities of boards
of directors has prompted a wide-ranging panel to urge voluntary action to
improve corporate governance and the quality of corporate accounting
statements.
Sir Adrian Cadbury, chairman of the Committee on Financial Aspects of
Corporate Governance, said in an interview with the Financial Times that
several recent corporate collapses had increased pressure for tighter
controls.
'One of the issues before us is a political one, ' he said, noting that the
Labour party had prepared a briefing paper on accounting reform. 'That will
concentrate the minds of those companies who do not believe it is in their
interests to raise standards,' he added.
His committee had sought a consensus on self-regulation because all parties
believed government regulation could be an alternative.
He said that while regulation was more likely from a Labour government, it
would not be inconceivable that a Tory government would seek some controls.
Sir Adrian warned, however, that recommendations from his committee might
not be as far-reaching as some would have liked. For instance, the final
report, expected to be produced in late May, will make no specific
recommendations on executive remuneration.
'Remuneration is a part of that much bigger question of board
accountability,' he said. The report is expected to focus on the quality of
accounts and the responsibilities of directors in preparing them.

UK OIL production slipped to 1.9m barrels a day last month, a decline of

The fall in output was partly a result of shutdowns on the Flotta pipeline
as the new Piper B oil platform was tied into the grid. Low oil prices and
weak world demand are causing many companies to focus on cost-cutting and
rationalisation this year.

FT  06 APR 92 / More complaints against brokers
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
COMPLAINTS about securities and futures brokers increased slightly last
year, according to a report published today.
Nevertheless, the complaints bureau of the Securities and Futures
Association, the self-regulatory organisation for the industry formed a year
ago by the merger of two other watchdogs, was given a clean bill of health
by the first annual report of its complaints commissioner.
The report shows that 1,206 complaints were received by the SFA. Of those,
73 should have been made direct to the Stock Exchange, leaving a total of
1,133, compared with 1,115 in 1990 and 1,025 in 1989.
Complaints were made against 158 firms, 11.4 per cent of the SFA's
membership of 1,380. In 1990 complaints were received against 9.5 per cent
of the previous regulator's membership.

FT  06 APR 92 / Midlands companies focus on efficiency
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COST CONTROL and cash management, allied to business planning, will be the
most important elements in running a company over the next few months,
according to the owners of private companies throughout the Midlands, Paul
Cheeseright writes.
Those priorities have emerged from a survey of 200 private companies,
largely in manufacturing and construction, carried out by Coopers &amp; Lybrand,
accountants, in Birmingham.
The aim of the survey was to gain an insight into business concerns as the
economy prepares to move out of recession, which, with uncertainty about
future economic policy caused by the election, has forced companies to pay
the highest attention to raising efficiency and cutting overheads.
The emphasis on costs and cash, mentioned by more than nine out of 10
companies in the sample, gives the impression, Coopers said, 'that whilst
little can be done to affect external factors, management is looking at
controlling internal factors to compensate for this'.

FT  06 APR 92 / Election 1992: How the foot-soldiers are faring in the
trenches
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
IF LABOUR pulls up short of the number of seats it needs on Thursday it may
regret not earmarking more resources for north-west England, a region
containing the highest concentration of marginals outside London.
In other critical regions - the Midlands and the capital itself - Mr Neil
Kinnock's party appears to have outfought the Tories at grassroots level,
maximising its chances of making critical gains.
But in the seats around Liverpool and Manchester, it is the Conservatives
who have had the edge. Although Labour - as elsewhere - has come out on top
in the window-poster war, the Tories have assembled the slicker machine, the
better local organisation and - after a slow start - the more copiously
distributed leaflets and other promotional material.
The Tories have also performed well in the relatively low-key campaign being
fought in the south-west, where their position as the party with the bulk of
the seats meant that they entered the fray with well-equipped offices and
full-time agents in the vast majority of constituencies.
In Scotland it is the Scottish National party which has most impressed, with
the best efforts of its rivals confined to marginals. Although it has fewer
public-relations professionals, the SNP has appeared to campaign more
efficiently and enthusiastically than the other leading parties, perhaps
because its resources are concentrated in one region and its tactics do not
have to be co-ordinated with headquarters in London.
The Tories and Labour alike have proved slovenly in safe seats. Far fewer
Conservative volunteers have come forward in Labour strongholds than in
previous elections, sapping morale and reducing the party to mailing
leaflets instead of knocking on doors.
Throughout the country, the Liberal Democrats have concentrated their
limited firepower on seats which they have a real prospect of winning or
face a fight to hold. In these, the party has supplemented its traditional
strength on the ground with the application of computer technology.
It has few resources to lavish on constituencies where it is not in the
frame. The rigour of its targeting is reflected in the party's organisation
in the north-east, where there are few seats on its target list and Mrs
Frances Foote Wood, an unpaid regional secretary turned campaign organiser,
is putting in a gruelling succession of 20-hour days from her County Durham
home.
The successful Labour campaigns in London and the Midlands have at least two
important characteristics in common.
First, both were exceptionally quick off the mark. While the Conservatives
set about organising their leaflets and posters after the starting pistol
had been fired, Labour was one step ahead - its leaflets printed, its
posters ready for display.
Second, both have exploited the computer and communications technology at
their disposal to maximum effect. The El-Pak software package, developed by
the boffins at Walworth Road, has helped constituency officers to get the
most out of their growing battery of machines. Computers have proved
particularly helpful in processing canvass returns and swiftly churning out
supplementary leaflets and circulars.
Labour's London campaign has also been noteworthy for the unprecedented
degree of central co-ordination. Operating from premises at the seedier end
of Islington, the well-staffed regional office has concentrated resources
singlemindedly on the 30 or so most marginal of the capital's 84
constituencies.
Under complex 'twinning' arrangements, helpers from safe seats have been
channelled into marginals where their efforts are most needed. The sense of
common purpose appears to have been strong enough to prevent complaints from
those left out in the cold as a result; team spirit has been fostered since
last spring by summoning the agents of marginal constituencies to bi-weekly
meetings and occasional residential weekends.
These tactics have received short shrift from Conservative Central Office,
which argues that Labour has conceded defeat in London by admitting there
are 'vast swathes' of the capital that it cannot win. However, if Labour
picks up the bulk of those seats it has targeted, it may force a rethink of
Tory strategy - to plug away doggedly in all constituencies - for future
contests.
In the Midlands, aspects of the Conservative campaign have appeared
surprisingly inept, as if three terms of continuous power had bred
complacency in the party's constituency offices.
For the most part, the battle is being fought much as it was in the previous
three elections. Computers are not widely used and morale appears low. Party
workers have been perturbed that daily themes put out by Central Office bear
little relation to the concerns of voters as expressed to candidates on the
ground.
In some Tory-held constituencies, the quality of campaign leaflets has been
amateurish compared with the efforts of Labour and the Liberal Democrats.
Surprising too has been the scruffiness of some Conservative candidates on
the hustings when set against the sharp image of their Labour opponents.
Contrast this with the position in the key marginals in the north-west of
England, where the Tories seem more generously funded than their main
rivals, and to be better off in terms of premises, computers, faxes and
telephone lines.
Highly marginal Tory-held Wallasey provides perhaps the starkest contrast in
the preparation of the two leading parties. Here, while the Conservatives
devoted the weeks before the campaign to compiling invaluable computerised
canvass returns, Labour was held back at the start by difficulties in
selecting a candidate. In spite of this, recent polls have indicated that
Labour is on course to secure the small swing needed to take the seat.
In the north-west, as elsewhere, the most effective teams from all the
parties are aiming for a complete canvass of marginals. The very best then
go for a secondary canvass, targeting undecideds and homes that were missed
the first time.
The true significance of such details will become clear only on Thursday. On
the evidence of the polls, few voters have been persuaded to alter their
views during the campaign. But, given the closeness of the election, the
effectiveness of local campaigning may prove decisive. Both Labour and the
Conservatives may live to regret their shortcomings in some of the
marginals.

FT  06 APR 92 / Election 1992: West country set to keep singing the blues
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'LABOUR's tax bombshell,' screams the 48-sheet billboard outside Barnstaple
station in north Devon. 'You'd pay Pounds 1,250 more tax under Labour.' And
underneath: 'Vote Conservative.'
Nothing unusual about that, the posters are all over Britain. However, in
the west country, they rankle not with Labour, but with supporters of the
party whose London campaign headquarters put them up.
What on earth, local Tories ask privately, is the point of erecting
anti-Labour posters in the west country when the battle the Conservatives
are fighting in the region is almost wholly against the Liberal Democrats? A
pro-Labour campaign would do more good: at least that might divide the
opposition.
It is another niggling example of why the west country perpetually feels
hard done by. The further west you go, the more powerful this feeling
becomes until, finally, you reach Cornwall.
Here, the feeling is all-pervasive. The Cornish are different - and if they
are not, they think they are. It is never quite clear why, and it is no good
trying to ask them. 'You have to be born and bred in Cornwall to understand
our peculiarities,' they reply.
Geography must have a lot to do with it. The county's position in the far
west has left it isolated throughout history - a part of Britain's rural
Celtic periphery, where associations with Liberalism are rooted in long
traditions of independence and religious nonconformism.
Cornwall's remoteness means that if outsiders see the county at all, it is
usually as tourists, carrying away images of picture-postcard villages,
craggy coastlines and pasties. To the Cornish, the reality is different.
Cornwall, once one of the world's largest tin and copper producers, has seen
its mining industry dwindle to nothing. Tourism is now the county's biggest
earner but that, too, has been stricken by a combination of recession and
the weather.
The Cornish resent being included in regional assessments as part of a
prosperous south-west. With some of Britain's lowest wage rates and
unemployment at more than 13 per cent, they have more in common with
Tyneside than Bristol or Cheltenham. The difference, they say, is that
people know about Tyneside's problems and are doing something about them.
Nobody cares about Cornwall.
There is some of the same sense in neighbouring Devon. Unemployment at 10
per cent is not as bad as in Cornwall, and wages are a little higher.
However, hoteliers have been hit by the recession, the county's
small-business economy has been squeezed and farmers whose incomes have
slumped say the government's agricultural policies ignore them in favour of
the big cereal producers of East Anglia and the south-east.
So is revolution in the air? New Statesman &amp; Society magazine has suggested
as much. On the stump in the south-west last month, it said that 'even
Torbay, with its retirement homes and golf courses, is being infected by a
proto-nationalist resentment with central government'.
That might be putting it a bit strongly. Even in Cornwall, the resentment
has not led to any resurgence of the proto-nationalist movement.
Yet there is something in the air. In the Devon countryside, where in
previous elections the Conservatives could have reassured themselves with
forests of signs indicating support, they now appear to be lagging seriously
behind potatoes and free-range eggs.
That might be an unreliable indicator of declining Tory fortunes but it is
backed up by conversations with the voters. Go to a village such as Black
Dog on the edge of Exmoor (a score of houses, a Methodist church, a village
hall and a pub) and you will find a clutch of former Conservative voters on
the brink of change.
Mr Desmond Reed, a jack of all trades in the local agricultural community,
said: 'I've always voted Conservative, but this time I really don't know. I
do a lot of shearing for the farmers and they're all saying they'd be better
off if the other lot got in - even the big men. We need that. If the farmers
do well, everybody does well round here.'
In Black Dog, in the marginal constituency of North Devon, the sitting MP is
Conservative and the man threatening to take his seat is a Liberal Democrat.
As in so much of the west country, Labour barely registers in the equation:
it is strictly a two-horse race.
This is why the Liberal Democrats are pinning so many hopes on the this
region. If they do well anywhere, it has to be here. Party strategists were
yesterday talking about winning seven or eight additional seats in the
region, if the Labour vote can be squeezed. The trouble is that the size of
the Conservative majority in most of the south-west is so vast that no
imaginable swing to the Liberal Democrats could eliminate it.
The Liberal Democrats' best chance is in the deep south-west, where the
sense of alienation is the strongest.
Even here, it would be rash to write off the Conservatives. In Devon and
Cornwall, an MP's allegiance to his or her region matters at least as much
to the voters as the MP's party affiliation, and Conservatives expecting to
retain their seats have taken care to establish their credentials as
professional mavericks when it comes to defending their constituencies'
interests.
Realistically the Liberal Democrats' victories are likely to be enumerated
on the fingers of one hand. In Cornwall, where they already hold Truro, the
only other seat they can be reasonably sure of winning is North Cornwall.
Conservative majorities in St Ives and Cornwall South East are simply too
big to put the seats within reach and a rare pocket of Labour support has
turned Falmouth and Camborne into an unpredictable three-way fight.
Next door in Devon, the Liberal Democrats ought to take remote North Devon,
once the seat of Mr Jeremy Thorpe, the former Liberal leader. But all the
rest of the rural constituencies are rock-solid Tory, with the possible
exception of Torbay. Even here it is hard to see all those hoteliers and
retired folk from London and the Midlands joining in a proto-nationalist
rebellion.
As for the rest of the south-west, the rural constituencies right up to
Bristol are heavily dominated by the Conservatives and will almost certainly
stay that way, with the notable exception of Liberal Democrat leader Paddy
Ashdown's Yeovil constituency in Somerset.
In the cities - Bristol, Plymouth and Exeter - Labour re-emerges as the
party likely to gain most from the Conservatives' misfortunes.
In all, then, the Liberal Democrats may hope for a surge of support in the
south-west, but it is unlikely to translate into more than three or four
extra seats.
If the west country is on the brink of a revolution, it looks like being a
small one: most of the region is set to remain unremittingly blue.

FT  06 APR 92 / Election 1992: SNP vote may help Forsyth saga to continue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A VISITOR to Stirling can hardly fail to realise it is one of the most
closely fought constituencies in Scotland.
Roundabouts on the town's outskirts are festooned with party posters while
on the streets the lampposts are only missing a contribution from the
Monster Raving Loony candidate. Even in far-flung areas of the largely rural
constituency, the posters jostle for attention on the approaches to
villages.
Mr Michael Forsyth holds the seat for the Conservatives with a majority of
548 over Labour. This time six parties are contesting the seat. The Labour
candidate, Mrs Kate Phillips, says she is quietly confident. The Scottish
National party, which came fourth in 1987, claims it has overtaken both
Labour and the Liberal Democrats and is now capturing Conservative votes.
In spite of Conservative assertions that its vote is holding up, the
campaign seems defensive. Windows on all sides of Tory HQ display SNP
posters, and a banner saying 'End the Forsyth saga' flutters from the house
next door. Visitors are inspected through a spy hole before the door is
unlocked.
Mr Forsyth's campaign literature does not mention that he is Scottish
minister for health and education. Opponents say this is because reforms in
the education and health services have been deeply unpopular in Scotland,
and it is safer not to draw attention to his part in them.
Mrs Elizabeth Ellis, who runs a shop in the village of Aberfoyle, north-west
of Stirling, has two school-age children. She will not be voting for Mr
Forsyth. 'School testing, opting out, I have been against it from the
start,' she said.
Mr Forsyth's agent says he is running a positive campaign based on his
record as a constituency MP, with the slogan, 'Working for you.' Mrs Ellis
is unimpressed. She said: 'I don't think Michael Forsyth has actually done
anything for this constituency.'
Along the street, Mrs Margaret Quinn says that Mr Forsyth was unhelpful when
she wrote to him about a housing problem. She is undecided, but said: 'I
won't be voting for him, anyway.'
Mr Forsyth has acquired a controversial reputation. He was pushed out of the
chairmanship of the Scottish Conservative party for his right-wing views.
Several of his assistants were former members of the far-right Federation of
Conservative Students. He is a member of the Thatcherite No Turning Back
group.
The highlight of his campaign so far was a visit by Mrs Margaret Thatcher.
She gave a rousing speech on the benefits of the union and the last 13 years
of Conservative rule, which went down well with the local Tories in the hall
but may have had a less favourable effect on the floating and tactical
voters that Mr Forsyth desperately needs to attract.
The danger for Labour in Stirling is not a resurgence in Conservative
support but the appeal of the SNP to former Labour voters. Over the country,
SNP support has doubled since the last election. If Mr Forsyth slips in with
another slim majority, it may well be thanks to the SNP.

FT  06 APR 92 / Election 1992: Labour steps up offensive over poll tax
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LABOUR is stepping up its attack on the poll tax as it becomes convinced
that the arrival of this year's bills is undermining the Tories' statements
that they have abolished it.
Although local authority associations estimate that 19 out of 20 people will
have received their bills by Thursday, the Tories say that they have not
seen a marked rise in the profile of the tax as an issue. Reaction from Tory
associations suggests, said one party strategist, that it was not an issue
that changed people's vote but was reinforcing views of people who would
vote Labour anyway.
Conservatives say that the surcharge - the extra amount shown on bills which
is largely to compensate for previous non-payment of the tax - is the aspect
most often raised but that it does not necessarily benefit Labour because of
some Labour involvement in the non-payment campaign.
Labour is putting great efforts into making the poll tax count locally.
Figures for its 'fair rates' proposals in each area have been produced. All
Labour candidates have been instructed to challenge their Tory opponents to
apologise for the poll tax.
Mr John Major said on BBC TV's On the Record that everyone regretted
mistakes. He added: 'A mistake was made. When you admit a mistake you
correct it.'
Labour says that its private polling suggests that the issue is now fourth
in importance behind health, the recession and education.
The latest phase of Labour's attack also focuses on the Liberal Democrats'
plans for a local income tax, and says that if Liberal Democrats were
serious in opposing the poll tax, they would support Labour's plans for a
'simple and fair property tax'.
There is anecdotal evidence that the poll tax, and its unpopular
associations such as imprisonment for non-payment, are not yet as dead as
the Tories would like. In reducing bills by up to Pounds 140 as from last
year and passing the council tax legislation, the Conservatives have done as
much as they can to take the tax off the agenda.
Their continuing vulnerability on the poll tax means the Conservatives have
not been able to raise the spectre of Labour in local government nor
capitalise on their own plans for re-organising local authorities. They have
not held a single press conference on local government outside London.

FT  06 APR 92 / Election 1992: Tory defeat may mean 'make or break' for TUC
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Trades Union Congress could become increasingly irrelevant if Labour
wins the election, with the biggest unions dealing directly with the
government.
Some senior TUC and union officials warn of a Labour victory being 'make or
break' for the TUC in its present form.
They also expect renewed pressure on Mr Norman Willis, TUC general
secretary, to retire early to make way for Mr John Monks, his deputy.
Mr Willis, having weathered eight years under the Tories, will not go
willingly. He has also just completed the first year of a four-year term as
European TUC president.
The TUC has the opportunity to restore some of its lost credibility in
helping a Labour government steer through a potentially ambitious programme
of industrial relations changes.
But as one TUC official said: 'The TUC has adapted much less well than many
of the bigger unions to the culture changes of the past decade'.
Industrial relations reforms will not be the top priority for a Labour
government and unions' expectations are not high.
But Labour party and union officials agree on what an ideal three-stage
timetable might be. The first stage would consist of symbolic gestures with
few immediate practical consequences. These would include signing the
Maastricht 'social chapter' and letting unions back into GCHQ, the
government's secret communications centre. Immediate changes, not requiring
primary legislation, could also be made to beef up employment protection.
The two main pieces of primary legislation would be a recognition act and an
act of positive rights for employees which would be named after Mr Tony
Blair, Labour's employment spokesman.
The recognition act would allow unions incremental representational rights,
depending on how many employees voted for such rights, culminating in full
collective bargaining rights if more than 50 per cent voted in favour.

FT  06 APR 92 / Election 1992: Heseltine charm glosses over contradictions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE has been only one other Conservative in recent memory who has fought a
general election campaign with such blinding self-belief. But then Mr
Michael Heseltine always had much more in common with Mrs Margaret Thatcher
than either cared to admit.
To spend a day with Mr Heseltine on the campaign trail is to return from Mr
John Major's Conservative consensualism to the implacable certainties of the
Thatcher years. It is also to watch a political maestro rewrite history.
Picture a market square in a small town at the centre of one of the Midlands
marginals which will decide the outcome on April 9. Mr Heseltine sweeps
along the nondescript high street with the energy of a politician half his
59 years - pumping hands, sprinkling the air with jibes against Mr Neil
Kinnock and warning repeatedly that only Mr Major can pull Britain out of
the worldwide slump.
A group of hecklers has gathered on the edge of the square to admonish the
environment secretary for the poll tax, rising unemployment and the
Conservatives' careless custodianship of the welfare state. They shout and
jeer. It takes Mr Heseltine, as brilliant a public speaker on the street
corner as he is before the Tory faithful, all of 10 seconds to seize his
chance.
Here was what he has been warning about throughout the campaign: the
'mindless mob' who would again rule if Mr Kinnock grabbed power. There would
be riots on the streets - look what was happening in socialist France - the
economy would be brought to its knees, the ladder of Tory opportunity would
be kicked away.
The 'mob', a scruffy but less than threatening huddle of youths, look
bemused. They pause. By the time they have caught their breath, he is
settled in the front of a white Jaguar heading to yet another market square
in another marginal to inject the Heseltine 'magic' into a flagging
Conservative campaign.
If the Conservatives lose on Thursday nobody must be allowed to say that Mr
Heseltine did not campaign for victory. He has fought this election as if
he, rather than Mr Major, had inherited the party leadership after the
toppling of Mrs Thatcher. He has fought it as if he had been no more than an
innocent by-stander in the fall of the leader who had won her party three
successive general election victories. He has fought it as if he believes
still that his own destiny lies in 10 Downing Street.
On television and at the Central Office press conferences designed to set
the agenda for each day's campaigning, Mr Heseltine has been the most
visible - and consistently optimistic - of Mr Major's senior ministers. As
he has led the attack on Labour's tax policies, party strategists have taken
to referring to him as the Conservative shadow chancellor. Nobody has poured
so much unapologetic and colourful scorn on Mr Kinnock's fitness for office.
The Conservative campaign has stumbled from the outset because it has failed
to build a firm enough bridge between its past and its future. Too many
cabinet ministers, Mr Major among them, have agonised too openly over
whether to defend the Conservative record or to promote a different future.
Mr Heseltine has no such dilemma. He promotes Mr Major's vision and defends
Mrs Thatcher's past with equal vigour. The two are joined seamlessly by an
uncompromising political rhetoric which refuses to admit the contradictions.
Back to one of those Midlands marginals. A local radio reporter has the
temerity to ask whether the environment secretary has any regrets about the
poll tax. He had, after all, always opposed it; and it had also laid the
foundations for his challenge to Mrs Thatcher.
From his reply, Mr Heseltine might have been the architect not the
demolisher of the tax. 'I think people are appalled at the Labour surcharge
on the poll tax. The surcharge is there because Labour members of parliament
and Labour councillors have told people to break the law and refuse to pay.'
A few hours later he is proclaiming the virtues of the council tax. For a
moment you are persuaded that the poll tax must have been another dreadful
mistake of the last Labour government rather than Mrs Thatcher's flagship.
But by the time reality dawns, Mr Heseltine has long moved on to proclaim
the triumphs of 13 Conservative years.
The economy is stronger than it has ever been - look how Germany has been
hit by the world recession. Enterprise, choice and opportunity are
flourishing. The health service has tens of thousands more doctors,
dentists, nurses. The number of students at polytechnics has jumped tenfold.
As the environment secretary gets into his stride at an evening rally, party
workers are whisked into a classless society where the 'airline workers own
the airlines, ity and gas industries, bus conductors own the bus companies'.
A year ago Mr Heseltine was the traitor who stabbed the leader they adored.
Now he is in the vanguard of the fight to preserve her legacy.
It is hard to believe that the voters are being won back by such flights
from reality. The recession, NHS waiting lists and the poll tax cannot be
shrugged aside so easily on the doorstep. But then the voters choose only
the prime minister. If they opt for Mr Kinnock on Thursday, it may be that
the Conservative party faithful will be looking for a new leader.

THE FINAL full week of the election campaign showed the FT Election Share
Index moving against a Conservative victory as stocks that might benefit if
Mr John Major returns to Downing Street did much worse than those that might
benefit from a Labour win.
The index, published daily during the campaign, consists of 10 stocks which
might outperform in the event of a Labour victory and 10 which could benefit
from a Conservative win.
Its performance last week reverted to that seen in the early days of the
campaign, undoing the reversal of trend seen in the previous week.
The big loser of the week was BET, the businesses services group, down 11.6
per cent. It is suffering from worries specific to the company's performance
as well as concern that a Labour-imposed minimum wage might raise the cost
of employing BET's army of service workers.
Another big loser on the Tory side was SG Warburg, the merchant bank, which
has been affected by concern that a Labour government might clamp down on
merger activity, and hit the bank's corporate finance revenues. Its shares
fell 6.9 per cent on the week, as did those of Prudential, the UK's largest
life insurer.
Utilities such as National Power, British Telecom and Thames Water, which
dropped heavily earlier in the campaign, appeared to have absorbed most of
the bad news. Last week, their decline slowed as they dropped by between 2
per cent and 4 per cent.
On the Labour side, the week's big loser was Land Securities, the UK's
largest property company, which fell 6.7 per cent. Though it is regarded as
the strongest in its sector, the group suffered from the bad news affecting
other property companies such as Olympia &amp; York, Heron and Speyhawk.
The base for the index is closing prices on the day the election was
announced, Wednesday March 11. Both sections are set to 100 at that date.
The index is constructed on the same basis as the FT 30-share Ordinary index
 -making it highly sensitive to day-to-day movements and unsuitable for
long-term performance measurement.
Unlike the FT-SE 100 and FT-Actuaries All-Share indices, constituents are
not weighted by the relative size of the companies concerned.

FT  06 APR 92 / Election 1992: Kinnock speaks up for listening party
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Neil Kinnock redoubled his charm offensive on floating voters yesterday
by contrasting a Conservative government that 'insists it knows best' with a
Labour administration that 'will heed the people and act for their
well-being'.
In a speech to a gathering of celebrity supporters in London last night, the
Labour leader said voters have a 'straight choice' between change and 'more
of the same'.
The choice, he added, offered 'Conservatives who will continue to divide and
weaken the country and a Labour government which will lead the consensus to
build a confident and capable country'.
Mr Kinnock made a thinly veiled bid for the votes of Liberal Democrats and
other advocates of constitutional change by stressing Labour's readiness to
debate the issue.
While keeping Labour's options open, he acknowledged a 'widespread public
interest' in constitutional questions, ranging from 'intense to the mildly
intrigued'.
Yet the Tories demonstrated 'extraordinary arrogance' by claiming that
Britain had reached a constitutional high-tide mark and that 'the system is
incapable of improvement'.
Laying out Labour's programme of reforms - a freedom of information act,
devolution, a framework for individual rights and a commitment to examine
new electoral systems - he said that the Tories wanted to concentrate
authority and maintain government secrecy. 'They are the party that puts the
preservation of its own privileges and power far above the need to ensure
that democracy gains extra vitality,' he said.
By contrast Labour would demonstrate a willingness to listen, to reason and
to serve all the people, he said.
Anticipating charges of being patronising or paternalist, Mr Kinnock added:
'There is nothing of the 'nanny state' about it. There is everything of the
democratic government about it.'
The Labour leader was applauded by an audience of 'achievers' in occupations
ranging from architecture to the ambulance service. They included Sir Ian
McKellen, Harold Pinter, Roger McGough, Alison Moyet, Vivienne Westwood,
Mike Leigh and Bishop Trevor Huddleston.
Today Labour will return to the economy by reiterating its strategy to
stimulate recovery. Mr Norman Lamont yesterday called on Labour to tear up
its election manifesto, as the Tories renewed their assault on apparent
discrepancies between Labour's spending and revenue-raising pledges.
In a letter to Mr Kinnock the chancellor called on Labour to acknowledge
that it promised to 'increase expenditure massively without increasing
taxation'.
'Without the money to pay for your promises, your manifesto is not worth the
paper it is written on,' he said.
His remarks followed Mr Kinnock's interview on BBC Radio in which he
suggested that many of the promises in the Labour manifesto should be
regarded as 'realistic aspirations' to be honoured when resources allowed.

FT  06 APR 92 / Election 1992: Labour plays game of Paddy in the middle -
Moves to curtail Ashdown's influence in a hung parliament
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EVEN before a single vote is cast, Labour's game plan for the last three
days of campaigning is being carefully formulated to maximise the party's
leverage in the event of a hung parliament.
The aim is to stress a programme for government finely tuned to appeal to
Liberal Democrats and calculated to create nightmarish difficulties for Mr
Paddy Ashdown should he want to persuade his MPs to vote it down.
Before April 9 the message to voters is that Labour can be trusted. As Mr
Bryan Gould, the shadow environment secretary, told a London news conference
yesterday, Labour's intention is to build a national consensus beyond party
politics. 'We do not intend to reproduce the disastrous experience of the
Thatcher government, in which the winner-takes-all attitude was thought to
be justification for inflicting extremist policies, such as the poll tax,'
he said.
This consensual appeal is intended to counter the Conservatives' claim that
a vote for anyone other than Mr Major is a vote for a radical Kinnock
government. As one Labour strategist put it yesterday: 'We want not just to
hold on to the votes of those who have come to us from the Lib Dems, but
also to ensure that the Tory voters now going for Paddy Ashdown don't shift
back.'
But there is a another game also being played: a game of political chicken
that begins just as soon as the votes are counted. If, as almost all the
pundits currently expect, Labour were to be the largest party in a hung
parliament, its first objective is to formulate a Queen's Speech that
commands the widest possible support. Mr Ashdown has said he will order his
MPs to vote down any Labour programme that does not offer immediate
legislation to introduce electoral reform for the Commons. But will he
really do so if Labour's legislative package is full of Liberal Democrat
policy objectives? And, if he does, will his troops follow?
Labour party strategists say Mr Kinnock will not seek any formal pact with
the Liberal Democrats in these circumstances. He will, instead, try to
create the conditions where Mr Ashdown is unable to persuade his Scots MPs
to oppose Labour's programme.
That process began last week when Labour outlined a Queens' Speech of which
the flagship bill will be the legislation to create a Edinburgh parliament -
exactly along the lines painstakingly hammered out with Scots Liberal
Democrats in the Scottish convention.
Other bills on such issues as Freedom of Information will also prove
difficult for the Liberal Democrats to oppose, as will the increases in
pensions and child benefit: all proposals broadly parallel to those in Mr
Ashdown's manifesto.
To muddy the water further, Mr Kinnock and his team stressed last week that
they are going a long way down the electoral reform road. Without any prior
commitments, they are promising to convert Professor Raymond Plant's working
party on electoral systems into an all-party commission, to report within a
year.
Although Mr Kinnock has expressed a personal preference to put the
commission's ultimate conclusions on reform to the public at a general
election, he has raised the option of a referendum once a decision on the
best electoral system is reached.
As Mr Roy Hattersley, Labour's deputy leader, put it last week, can the
Liberal Democrats really reasonably expect more when so large a question is
at issue?
With Mr John Major and the Conservatives definitively ruling out any
discussion of a revision of the first-past-the-post system - 'never, never,
never' were the prime minister's words - the Liberal Democrats cannot
possibly reach an accord with the Tories.
If the Conservatives voted against Labour's Queen's Speech, the Liberal
Democrats' might well have to decide whether to vote it down and force
another election, or to abstain.
Mr Kinnock's team believes that if Mr Ashdown demands that his MPs vote the
speech down, many of his Scottish MPs will rebel - knowing that to be seen
throwing out legislation for a Scottish parliament will destroy their
chances in the subsequent election.
Publicly, Mr Ashdown has been categorical in his rejection of anything short
of legislation in the first session for electoral reform. Even were this to
be on offer, serious complications would arise - not least in agreeing
rapidly what form of proportional representation should be adopted.
Labour is convinced that the Liberal Democrats' dogmatic stance is a bluff
as voters would take a fierce revenge on any party that forced another
election immediately.
If a hung parliament with Labour as the largest party is the election's
outcome, it will not be long before Mr Ashdown's real hand has to be put
down on the table.

FT  06 APR 92 / Election 1992: Voters seem resigned to a hung parliament
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN appears set for a hung parliament after Thursday's election but
there is little enthusiasm for the prospect among the voters.
The message of the latest batch of opinion polls is that the two central
elements in the Conservative strategy - tax and Mr John Major's leadership -
have failed to close the narrow lead which Labour established at the outset
of the campaign.
Late swings in past elections - in 1970 and February 1974 - have seen bigger
leads overturned, but senior cabinet ministers were among those
Conservatives who were suggesting yesterday that the best Mr Major could now
hope for was to emerge as the leader of the largest party in a hung
parliament.
The health service, un-employment and education rather than taxation remain
overwhelmingly the issues which the voters say are uppermost in their minds,
while Mr Major's soapbox performances around the country have failed to
prevent a further erosion in his personal lead over Mr Neil Kinnock.
The FT's poll of polls (which excludes yesterday's two panel surveys) puts
Labour at 39.4 per cent against the Conservatives on 37.1 per cent and the
Liberal Democrats on 19.4 per cent.
Translated into representation at Westminster that would give Labour 307
seats, 19 short of an overall majority, while the Conservatives would be on
296. That would leave the Liberal Democrats holding the balance of power.
Two polls published yesterday signal that the voters have been persuaded
that neither of the main parties is likely to win an overall majority.
Gallup for the Sunday Telegraph suggests that 71 per cent expect a hung
parliament. Only 18 per cent welcome the prospect, 50 per cent are unhappy
with the idea and the remainder are unconcerned either way.
NOP for the Mail on Sunday found that 40 per cent of the electorate think a
coalition government would be 'bad' for Britain, while 38 per cent were in
favour.
The surveys point to a continuing slide in Mr Major's lead over Mr Kinnock
as the most competent party leader. A Mori panel survey for The Sunday Times
says that the 26-point lead in satisfaction ratings with which Mr Major
started the campaign had by last week shrunk to nothing. Both leaders
enjoyed a net rating (the satisfieds minus the dissatisfieds) of 2 per cent.
An ICM poll for the Sunday Express found that 38 per cent of voters said Mr
Major would make a better prime minister than his rivals. Mr Kinnock scores
25 per cent and Mr Paddy Ashdown 19 per cent.
Mori suggests that the Conservatives' sustained onslaught on Labour's tax
policies has yet to persuade the electorate that tax is the issue on which
they should decide their vote. Although they may change their minds in the
privacy of the voting booth, the survey suggests only 13 per cent regard
their tax bills as the central issue, while 59 per cent highlight the health
service as a deciding factor.
The Tories could lose the marginal Birmingham seat of Selly Oak, according
to an opinion poll.
It would mean the disappearance from Westminster of Mr Anthony
Beaumont-Dark, one of the most vocal of Tory backbenchers.
A Quality Fieldwork poll for the Birmingham Post newspaper put Labour eight
points ahead of the Conservatives. In 1987 Mr Beaumont-Dark retained the
seat with a majority of 2,584 over Labour in a four-cornered contest.
Quality Fieldwork interviewed 921 voters in the constituency on March 31 and
April 1.

FT  06 APR 92 / Election 1992: Major warns of constitutional 'danger'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN IMPASSIONED call to Britain to wake up to the 'sleeping' constitutional
issues to be decided in the election came yesterday from Mr John Major.
As the campaign entered its final few days, Mr Major strongly attacked the
potentially disastrous consequences of a Labour government. He warned that
if people did not understand what was at stake 'we could take the sword of
socialism and fall on it, and if we did, our country would fall with it'.
In contrast to his apocalyptic tones on the constitutional issue, Mr Major
highlighted the 'golden prospects' for the economy under the Tories, and the
achievements of the 1980s. He said the day after a Tory victory, industry
would 'breathe a sigh of relief that the threat of socialism is gone' and
begin investing again.
The style of the Tory rally at London's Wembley conference centre, using a
Pounds 500,000 circular set that seated about 1,000 people, was in
deliberate contrast to Labour's extravaganza in Sheffield last week. Mr
Major suggested the rival rally was somewhat 'unBritish' in its
regimentation.
Instead the format was that used for similar occasions around the country
during the campaign. The main difference was that there were sporting and
showbusiness celebrities sprinkled about the audience.
The main thrust of Mr Major's speech was that people should realise the
threat from the proposals for devolution or separation for Scotland put
forward by the other parties.
He said: 'If I could summon up all the authority of the office I now hold,
through the ages, I would put it into this single warning. The United
Kingdom is in danger. Wake up now before it is too late.
'Consider the outcome - the walls of this United Kingdom that appear so
strong, undermined from within.'
In an implicit appeal to former Tory voters inclined to support the Liberal
Democrats, he spoke of the risk that people were treating Thursday's poll as
a by-election and wanted to register a protest vote without really
recognising that the government elected as a result would actually take
office.
He also highlighted two other threats to the UK constitution: the opposition
parties' attitude to the European Community, and proportional
representation.
'The Lib-Lab left would not speak for Britain in Brussels, they would act
for Brussels in Britain,' he said. Again linking Labour and the Liberal
Democrats, he accused them both of toying with the constitution almost
casually for political advantage.
Following Mr Kinnock's denunciation last week of the 'sin' of parents facing
the choice of having to pay or to wait for an operation on their child, Mr
Major vigorously insisted that it was right for family members to want to
take care of each other.

FT  06 APR 92 / Election 1992: Coalition terms will test Liberal Democrat
mettle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR PADDY Ashdown admitted yesterday that 'difficulties and tensions' would
be created in Liberal Democrat ranks by the party's tough terms for a
coalition government in a hung parliament.
Reiterating his demand for a commitment to proportional representation in
the first session of the new parliament, Mr Ashdown acknowledged that 'the
mettle of my party, and the parliamentary party, will be tested'.
He also warned on London Weekend Television's Walden programme that, if a
second general election were necessary, 'it'll be better that it would be
sooner rather than later. At least we would get over the period of unstable,
weak government.'
He accepted he might be blamed for causing a second contest but denied that
the pressures on Liberal Democrat MPs would be intolerable.
His comments came amid signs of growing realisation among prominent members
of the party that a hung parliament would hold considerable danger, possibly
wrecking Liberal Democrat unity.
'Part of the reason why nobody has gone out banging on for a hung parliament
is that it is full of pitfalls and problems,' admitted one party strategist.
Mr Ashdown has been able to reconcile the comments of senior colleagues with
his own stance, but differences of emphasis are evident.
Scottish Liberal Democrats, including Mr Charles Kennedy, the party
president, and Sir David Steel, former Liberal leader, have hinted they
would be happy with a less fierce commitment to proportional representation.
Many of the Scottish Liberal Democrat former MPs put greater emphasis on
Scottish devolution rather than Westminster reform.
The Liberal Democrat terms for a coalition government were thrashed out and
agreed by the parliamentary party well before the general election. During
the campaign, however, Mr Ashdown has had only brief conversations with most
of his former parliamentary colleagues.
Yesterday he tried to increase the pressure on Labour and the Tories to form
a coalition government, while simultaneously remaining firm on his terms for
a deal. He called for a 'partnership' working at all levels of government,
including cabinet posts for Liberal Democrats.
In a party election broadcast last night, Mr Ashdown urged 'the kind of
government that has made Germany so strong'. He promised to make compromises
and to work for an agreement, but 'we will definitely insist . . . that this
should be the last election held on an unfair and out-of-date voting
system'.
Speaking on LWT, Mr Ashdown warned that if neither Labour nor the Tories
formed a coalition 'you would have six months of a minority government -
weak, unable to tackle the problems of the recession, with money markets
dropping and interest rates rising. Now that is a devastating scenario.'

LABOUR has retained a commanding lead over the Scottish National party in
Scotland, according to two weekend opinion polls. These contradicted a poll
last week showing a narrowing of the gap between the two parties.
Mori in The Sunday Times newspaper put Labour on 44 per cent and Market
Research Scotland put the party on 43 per cent, in line with the findings of
most polls since the campaign began. Backing for the SNP was 27 per cent in
the MRS poll and only 23 per cent in the Mori survey.
The Conservatives were on 21 per cent in the Mori poll and 18 per cent
according to MRS.

Liverpool Echo newspaper.
The Conservatives may also lose the nearby seat of Chester, which Mr Gyles
Brandreth, the broadcaster, is contesting following the retirement of Sir
Peter Morrison.
The Echo poll, of 841 people, shows Mrs Chalker trailing Labour's Ms Angela
Eagle by 7 per cent. Ms Eagle has 45 per cent of those who have already made
up their minds, Mrs Chalker 38 per cent, and Mr Neil Thomas, the Liberal
Democrat, 16 per cent. A Green party candidate has 1 per cent.
In Chester, a poll by the Liverpool Daily Post newspaper shows Labour in the
lead by 42 per cent to 37 per cent, with the Liberal Democrats on 20 per
cent. The sample was 502 people.

FT  06 APR 92 / Election 1992: Polls highlight PM's dilemma
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CONSERVATIVES enter the final few days of the campaign behind Labour,
and their chances of closing the gap do not look promising.
Although many opinion polls have shown that the electorate as a whole thinks
Mr John Major would be a more capable prime minister than his rivals, his
party's campaign has failed to persuade floating voters that Tory policies
are the best or that he is the most capable leader.
These are the main conclusions of a survey of floating voters conducted by
Mori for the BBC.
The findings of the fifth wave of interviews among this panel, conducted on
Thursday and Friday of last week, show that just 16 per cent of the
electorate are still in the 'floating' category, made up of 2 per cent who
say they will not vote, 2 per cent who are still undecided and 12 per cent
who say they now support a party but who 'may change their mind' before
polling day.
Only about two in three of these will vote on the day, leaving one in 10 of
the electorate for the parties to fight over in the final days of the
campaign.
Before the campaign began no fewer than 39 per cent of the electorate were
'floaters', including 15 per cent classed as 'don't know's', and 24 per cent
'soft supporters' - for example, those with stated party loyalties but
possibly willing to switch.
According to other Mori polls, the key issues in the minds of the voters are
health, education and jobs.
Among the floating voters in the Mori/BBC panel, Labour has a wide lead over
the Conservatives on health (23 points) and unemployment (28 points), but on
education the Liberal Democrats beat both the larger parties, with 33 per
cent to Labour's 29 per cent and the Conservatives' 28 per cent.
During the campaign the Conservatives have made no ground at all on Labour
over health and education. On the handling of inflation, they have
maintained a strong lead over Labour - 48 per cent to 19 per cent. However,
on unemployment the Conservatives have gained three points but still lag 28
points behind Labour.
The tax issue has failed to ignite in the way the Conservative party hoped;
floating voters have not rated it high as an issue.
This may partly be explained by the finding that only 3 per cent of the
panel said they expected the Conservatives to cut the overall level of tax
'a lot' and a majority, 57 per cent, don't think the Tories would cut tax at
all.
The Tories' crucial weaknesses seem to be mood and record.
Members of the panel were asked whether they agreed or disagreed that 'it's
time for a change'. Three in four of the panel agreed, including more than a
third of those inclined to vote Conservative.
Superficially, the government's record appears not to be a problem. Only one
in 10 floating voters feel that the Major government bears responsibility
for the recession, whereas just more than half blame Mrs Margaret Thatcher's
government, with a similar proportion blaming the world economy.
This 'Teflon factor', however, does not really protect Mr John Major because
floating voters who blame the Thatcher government have been more reluctant
to switch to the Tories during the campaign than those who do not.
Only one in four Conservative switchers blame Mrs Thatcher, compared with
almost three quarters of Labour switchers. Since more than half those on the
panel who are still wavering also believe the Thatcher government bears
blame for the recession, they may be more likely to switch to Labour rather
than the Conservatives.
Meanwhile, Labour has made up ground on the economy. The Conservatives began
the campaign with a significant 42 per cent to 19 per cent lead over Labour
as the party which floating voters think can best handle the economy, a lead
of 23 points. By the end of last week they were recording 41 per cent to the
Labour party's 23 per cent, losing five points of their lead along the way.
The Liberal Democrats boosted their level from 10 per cent to 18 per cent.
There has also been a big switch in the floating voter view of the battle
between the party leaders. At the start of the campaign Mr Major had a 15
per cent lead over Mr Paddy Ashdown as 'the most capable prime minister',
with Mr Neil Kinnock trailing a poor third.
By this weekend Mr Kinnock still trailed at 16 per cent, but Mr Ashdown had
overtaken Mr Major, with 39 per cent to the prime minister's 35 per cent.
When asked which party leader had been most impressive during the campaign,
a majority of the floating voters (54 per cent) picked Mr Ashdown, a sharp
rise from the 38 per cent who expressed this view after one week of
campaigning.
Mr Major's campaign rating has fallen to 14 per cent, behind Mr Kinnock. One
explanation for Mr Ashdown's success in the campaign might be the fact that
floating voters think he has fought positively on his party's issues.
Three floaters in four think the Liberal Democrats have mainly put forward
their own policies rather than attacking the other parties. Three in four
(76 per cent) think the Conservatives have mainly attacked their opponents;
six in 10 say the same of Labour.
Floating voters are split on the idea of coalition government.
Half say it would be better for Britain to be governed by a single party,
while 46 per cent would prefer a coalition.
John Curtice is senior lecturer in politics at Strathclyde University.
The BBC survey was undertaken by Mori in five waves, starting the week
before the election campaign began. Mori spoke by telephone to 1,146
panellists, weighted to reflect the profile of all floating voters on April
2-3 .

US and Canadian trade chiefs are expected to press their Mexican counterpart
at a meeting in Montreal today for concessions in key areas of negotiations
towards a North American free trade agreement (Nafta), write Bernard Simon
in Toronto and Nancy Dunne in Washington.
Mexican restrictions on imports of automotive products and on foreign
investment in the energy industry are likely to be among the issues during
the three-day meeting of US trade representative Mrs Carla Hills, Canadian
trade minister Michael Wilson and Mexican commerce secretary Jaime Serra
Puche.
Although a senior Canadian official said the meeting would lay the
groundwork for the 'final phase' of the Nafta negotiations, there is still
uncertainty whether an agreement can be put in place before the US elections
in November.
A Canadian official said 'a considerable amount of work' remained to be done
on some of the most sensitive issues.
The automotive sector is among those where the strongest disagreements
remain. The three countries have so far failed to come up with common
definitions for determining rules of origin.

FT  06 APR 92 / Election 1992: Health warning - these comparisons may be
harmful
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THERE ARE lies, damned lies, statistics, and statistics about health care
spending. Few public policy areas are more notorious for their ability to
confuse and bemuse the uninitiated. The variety of misleading and often
contradictory indicators makes international comparisons of the output and
efficiency of national health care systems prohibitively difficult. Even the
deceptively simple task of comparing the quantity of resources devoted to
health care can be misleading.
The information presented above is compiled from the OECD's Health Databank.
It is collected from national sources and will inevitably reflect the very
different health care systems in each of the six countries included in the
table: whether provision is predominantly public or private, provided free
or via an insurance system, and the relative importance of hospital and
ambulatory provision within total spending.
Real health expenditure can be compared using more or less sophisticated
measures. The UK government uses the simpler technique of deflating total
health spending using the gross domestic product deflator which is based on
the prices of all domestically produced goods. On this measure, real health
spending in the UK grew at an average annual rate of 3.5 per cent between
1979 and 1990. Because UK health spending grew faster than GDP, total health
spending rose as a percentage of GDP from 5.6 per cent in 1980 to 6.1 per
cent in 1990. But the UK's share of health spending in total GDP remains the
lowest of all six countries.
Yet both these measures give a misleading impression of the growth in real
resources that were devoted to UK health care in the 1980s. The OECD
calculates a more accurate measure of the real growth of health spending
using a special health deflator. It is based on an index of health care
input prices: the wages of health workers, ambulatory services, therapeutic
appliances, and pharmaceuticals.
This more sophisticated measure paints a less impressive picture of the UK
government's record over the past decade. The average annual growth of real
health care spending between 1979 and 1990 falls to 1.8 per cent, lower than
the average rate of growth of both GDP and GDP per head. Much of the growth
in total spending was in private health provision. Public health spending
grew by only 1.2 per cent a year and accounted for two-fifths of the total
rise in spending as a percentage of GDP over the 1980s. This goes some way
to explaining the apparent contradiction between the rise in the share of
health spending in GDP and Labour's claim the National Health Service is
underfunded.
Only Germany had a slower growth rate of total real health spending per head
in the 1980s, although the growth rate of UK GDP per head was higher than in
any country except Japan. France, by contrast, had the fastest growth of
real health spending in the 1980s but the lowest real growth rate of GDP per
head.
Yet there is a relatively robust relationship between the level of GDP per
head and the level of real health spending per head. The upper chart shows
them both in 1990 dollars, using purchasing power parity exchange rates to
adjust for cross-country price level differences. The US has both the
highest GDP per head and the highest real health spending per head. The UK
has the lowest level of health spending and almost the lowest GDP per head.
Japan's health care spending is much lower than would be predicted by its
income per head. But the relatively rapid ageing of the Japanese population
over the next two decades may bring it into line.
The wealthier a country is, the more it tends to spend on health care; but
more spending may not mean better quality care. The US spends over twice as
much as the UK as a percentage of GDP; but over 10 per cent of the US
population has no assured access to health care. Nonetheless, the likely
shortage of economic growth in the UK over the next two or more years will
constrain the quantity of health spending, whoever wins the election.
INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC INDICATORS: HEALTH CARE SPENDING
This table compares international health care spending. Real growth rates
are derived in the first section using the general GDP deflator, and in the
second section using the appropriate health care deflators. The third
section shows spending as percentages of nominal GDP. The fourth section
shows spending per head in US dollars at current purchasing power parities
(PPPs).

FT  06 APR 92 / Debt burden setback for Latin America
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN FIDLER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SANTO DOMINGO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PROGRESS in lowering Latin America's debt and debt service burdens was
interrupted last year, according to the Inter-American Development Bank. In
its annual report today, the bank says the ratio of debt service payments to
exports - an important measure of the burden of servicing debt - rose from
26 per cent in 1990 to 30 per cent last year.
This was due in part to extra debt payments, for example by Brazil, to clear
arrears with commercial banks. But it also reflected a slowing in demand for
the region's exports stemming from the economic slowdown in the industrial
countries, depressed and declining commodity prices and deteriorating terms
of trade.
Since demand for imports also rose as investment and output increased, the
region's trade surplus shrank and its current account deficit expanded
substantially.
The stock of the debt of Latin America and the Caribbean fell slightly last
year from the end-1990 level of Dollars 431.8bn (Pounds 251bn), as debt
conversions roughly offset an increase in debt associated with new lending
and exchange rate changes.
However, foreign direct investment and portfolio investment continued to
rise last year. This continued a trend in evidence since 1987: a rise in the
proportion of the region's resource inflows 'which do not create debt'.
These inflows more than covered the region's rising current account deficit,
allowing for a rise in its international reserves. In fact, for some
countries, increased imports were the consequence of high real exchange
rates associated with the large capital inflows.
In a generally positive assessment, the bank said Latin America and the
Caribbean made impressive gains in economic growth last year, averaging 2.7
per cent. Nonetheless, average per capita output in the region is still only
at the level of a decade and a half ago.
This has contributed to 'severe social problems' deriving from high
unemployment, depressed incomes and poor provision of social services.
Many countries plan new initiatives to alleviate poverty, increasing the
cost effectiveness of the delivery of social services and improving the
targeting of such services.
During 1991, the bank approved loans for more money than ever: 77 loans
committing Dollars 5.42bn, up nearly 40 per cent on 1990. Of this, Dollars
2bn was committed in fast-disbursing balance of payments loans to encourage
economic reform. Nicaragua and Peru cleared the arrears with the bank in
1991, allowing them to resume borrowing from the bank. Panama has done so
this year, leaving no countries with so-called non-accrual status.

FT  06 APR 92 / Iranians bomb opposition base in Iraqi desert
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
IRANIAN aircraft bombed an Iranian opposition base in the Iraqi desert
yesterday, their first raid into Iraq since a ceasefire in 1988, Reuter
reports from Ashraf Base, Iraq. Anti-aircraft batteries shot down one, and
the exiled Iranian Mujahideen Khalq said it captured two crewmen.
The Mujahideen showed foreign journalists bomb damage at Ashraf base, 60
miles from Baghdad, and the burning wreckage of a F-4 Phantom.
Iran said it had responded to a Mujahideen raid on two border villages on
Saturday.
Officers of the Mujahideen's National Liberation Army (NLA) said a dozen
Iranian F-4 and F-5 Phantoms attacked in six waves dropping cluster bombs,
firing rockets and strafing roads and vehicles.
Hundreds of Iranian dissidents stormed Tehran's embassies throughout Europe
and North America yesterday in protest at the bombing.
Damage was extensive, several buildings were set afire, and there were
widespread injuries and arrests. Missions in Germany, the UK, France,
Switzerland, the Netherlands, Sweden, Norway and Canada were attacked. In
New York, Iran's mission to the UN was briefly occupied and an employee held
hostage. In London, embassy windows were broken and a petrol bomb was thrown
at Iran Air's offices.

</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE White House is on the defensive about reports of an operational
'gridlock' over President George Bush's agenda and of rushing to publicise a
Dollars 24bn (Pounds 14bn) international aid programme for Russia for
domestic political reasons before details of the package had been agreed.
Mr Marlin Fitzwater, the president's spokesman, has denied a story in the
Washington Post that frustration with a sluggish White House bureaucracy has
driven him to the brink of resignation.
He praised the 'strong management team' put in place by Mr Sam Skinner, Mr
Bush's chief of staff.
However, the Post and other press reports are describing a White House
hampered by 'mini-bureaucracy' which has been unable to bridge differences
with campaign officials to fashion themes for the president's re-election
campaign.
One political achievement - the Russian aid package - is now being
criticised in Japan, where officials said the programme announced was larger
than had been agreed. Canadian officials also seemed confused about the
numbers, and the US State and Treasury Departments have each had different
estimates of the American contribution.
This has raised suspicions, denied by the White House, that the
administration rushed through the announcement of the aid before details had
been agreed by the Group of Seven industrial nations. Governor Mario Cuomo
of New York said Mr Bill Clinton was likely to be the Democratic nominee for
president, whether or not he wins the New York primary tomorrow. He urged
the governor to meet congressional leaders to draw up a plan for the
economy.

FT  06 APR 92 / The European Market: Bananas put Community's honour at stake
 -Brussels faces one of its toughest quota decisions tomorrow
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE EC's Single Market will be incomplete without them. A Uruguay Round
trade deal looks even less likely without them. The honour of the Community
is at stake because of them. As a result of this, they are the object of one
of the most intense lobbying operations the EC has witnessed.
So there are things you may not have suspected about bananas - not the fruit
of choice of the European Commission at the moment.
For after four years of circular argument, the 17 commissioners are supposed
tomorrow to make up their minds whether to make bananas grown in the EC's
outlying territories and former colonies subject to increasing competition
from much cheaper bananas from Central America.
The Commission is divided, as are the 12 member states. So the fruit, as one
official punned, may not be ripe for decision and slip off the agenda for a
third time in a month. The EC faces a genuine and serious conflict of
obligations. Brussels is also all too aware of the potential for headline
ridicule if it falls out publicly on how to reconcile these obligations.
The Community gets three out of every five of the 3.4m tonnes of bananas it
consumes from Central America, Colombia and Ecuador, marketed principally by
multinationals such as Chiquita and United Brands. These large plantation
bananas, from the so-called dollar zone, are produced at around half the
price of Eurobananas, which share the rest of the market.
The latter come mostly from smallholders in hilly overseas territories such
as France's Martinique and Guadeloupe, former colonies like the four
Windward Islands (where two out of three bananas eaten in the UK come from),
or offshore island provinces like Spain's Canary Islands, Portugal's
Madeira, or Greece's Crete.
They enter duty-free, whereas dollar bananas in most EC member states face
quotas, as well as a 20 per cent tariff everywhere except Germany, where the
fruit is accordingly cheaper, and over a third of Community imports are
consumed.
The EC has to try to reconcile itself to creating an open market in bananas
from next January, while ensuring its own and Caribbean producers are not
wiped out by dollar bananas with which they cannot compete, and yet at the
same time meeting its commitments to Gatt, the General Agreement on Tariffs
and Trade.
As part of the five-year old Uruguay Round, Gatt requires all farm products
to have import tariffs, which would be gradually lowered over the next six
years if an overall deal on trade liberalisation is reached by the Easter
deadline it has set.
Yet the EC has prior treaty obligations. Under the Lome Convention, a trade
and development agreement with 69 African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP)
countries, a special banana protocol says the EC will not place ACP
producers 'in a less favourable situation than in the past or present'.
The Canaries and Madeira are protected by the accession treaties for Spain
and Portugal. And should the EC decide on tariffs for dollar bananas, it has
to get around the original banana protocol, to the Treaty of Rome itself,
which guaranteed unimpeded access for a Germany starved of its favourite
fruit during the war and post-war years.
A sizeable minority of the Commission wants to set tariffs on dollar
bananas, while a narrow majority wants to seek exemption from Gatt rules and
set quotas.
Two or three commissioners appear undecided, but if tariffs win the day,
France, Spain, Portugal, maybe Greece and Italy, and possibly even the UK,
could combine to overturn the decision once it reaches the member states.
The tariff-iers want a hefty duty of Ecu353 (Pounds 253) a tonne - the
difference between the highest import price for Eurobananas and the lowest
import price from the dollar zone in 1986-88 - on top of the standard 20 per
cent tariff. This would apply to dollar zone imports over 1.4m tonnes.
In addition, the tariff proponents would seek aid to help EC banana
producers restructure their economies, and safeguard clauses within Gatt.
Seeking exemptions from Gatt will, they argue, unravel the Uruguay Round
package so far assembled, leading Japan to take out its rice, and the US to
seek waivers for milk, sugar, cotton and peanuts.
The quota defenders, led by Commission president Jacques Delors, believe
that even high tariffs will not protect the banana producers adequately, and
that EC standing will be more damaged if it dishonours treaty obligations
than if it seeks flexibility within commitments it has yet formally to
assume within Gatt.
A compromise is being floated for an 'unbound' tariff - meaning the EC would
have discretion to vary it. But while its proponents believe this may be
acceptable to Gatt, it is unlikely to be acceptable to the US, unless the EC
makes other costly concessions.
In the EC Council of Ministers, Mr Louis Mermaz, the influential French
agriculture minister, warned last week that the issue was 'not a question of
liberalisation but of the right to live'.
Hordes of lobbyists for the Caribbean producers, many of which earn up to
three-quarters of their hard currency from bananas, warn of Haiti-like
breakdown in these countries, making them easy prey for drug traffickers
using the western seaboard into the US. The dollar zone producers, they say,
have the whole US market, and will have all of eastern Europe, as well as
three-fifths of the west European market.
They disbelieve Commission assurances that EC competition rules will prevent
the dollar zone multinationals from concentrating their fire within
individual member states to drive ACP producers out.
Dame Eugenia Charles, prime minister of Dominica, said last month in
Brussels and London that tarification could not protect their industry. 'If
we lost the industry, we would lose the country,' she predicted. 'It would
be the beginning of despair.'
Under these circumstances, no formula the Commission decides on is likely to
be neat, or safe from criticism.

FT  06 APR 92 / Reaction to Beregovoy team tepid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ministerial team chosen by Mr Pierre Beregovoy, France's new prime
minister, met a tepid public reception over the weekend.
Some 46 per cent of the electorate were disappointed with Mr Beregovoy's
line-up, according to an opinion poll in Le Journal du Dimanche, while 40
per cent were satisfied and the remaining 14 per cent had no opinion.
The result contrasts with the majority approval accorded to Mr Beregovoy
personally in polls just after his selection last week. It also underlines
the difficulties the government faces in winning popularity.
Mr Beregovoy's new cabinet is younger than that of his predecessor, has a
strong showing of supporters of Mr Laurent Fabius, the Socialist party
secretary, and contains several surprise appointments like that of Mr
Bernard Tapie, the football club owner selected as minister for cities.

FT  06 APR 92 / Air France alliance with Sabena agreed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Belgian Government yesterday gave the go-ahead for the long-delayed
alliance between Sabena, the loss-making state-owned airline, and Air
France, the French national carrier.
Under the deal, Air France and its Belgian financial partners, led by the
Groupe Bruxelles Lambert holding company, will pay BFr6bn (Pounds 102m) for
a 37.5 per cent stake in Sabena. The stake will be owned by a holding
company two thirds owned by Air France - which accordingly contributes
BFr4bn to the total - and one third owned by the Belgian financial
institutions.
Sabena will still be open to other international airline partners, as
demanded by the Belgian government, said Mr Guy Coeme, the communications
minister. The chairmen of both airlines welcomed the government's agreement,
which Air France said would allow important industrial and commercial gains.
Air France and Sabena will co-operate on flights to and from their main
airports, Roissy-Charles de Gaulle and Zaventem, Brussels. Air France said
yesterday they were studying a Paris-Brussels air shuttle to make
connections between their respective international routes.
Sabena will adopt computer systems compatible with those of Air France, and
the pair plan to co-operate on maintenance, engineering and refuelling. This
should lead to savings on investments and stocks, said Air France. They will
also study co-ordinating equipment purchasing.
This ends months of uncertainty in the latest case of international airlines
seeking partnership deals in response to market deregulation.
The Belgian airline has been looking for a partner for over a year. Air
France emerged as favourite last autumn, ahead of British Airways, but talks
had to be suspended in October while Belgium sorted out its political
crisis.

FT  06 APR 92 / Bosnia's ethnic leaders appeal for peace: European Community
expected to recognise state's independence today
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Foreign Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ETHNIC leaders made a joint appeal for peace yesterday after fierce fighting
flared in the Yugoslav republic of Bosnia-Hercegovina.
Many people were reported killed in gunfights and air and artillery attacks,
which came on the eve of a European Community meeting to consider
recognising Bosnia as an independent state.
With automatic weapons fire and explosions continuing, leaders of Bosnia's
Moslem, Croat and Serbian communities joined federal army chiefs in a
televised plea for peace. As the Yugoslav federal state crumbles, Bosnia's
Moslems and Croats generally favour independence, which is pitting them
against the republic's Serbs.
A Sarajevo radio report claimed hundreds had been killed or wounded in the
town of Kupres, but this could not be confirmed. Croat irregulars were
reported to have seized the town, prompting a bloody three-day battle in
which two Yugoslav army jets were said to have been shot down.
In Sarajevo, about 7,000 demonstrators from the three ethnic communities
joined in a peace protest, defying gunfire echoing in the streets around
them. But at one point gunmen opened fire on the crowd, killing one
demonstrator and injuring 10.
Yugoslav army Mig-21 jet fighters swooped low over the city repeatedly, in
an attempt to drive the demonstrators from the streets. Clashes were also
reported near the town of Bosanksi Brod, and thousands of people were
fleeing the town of Brcko across a bridge into Croatia. It was the worst
fighting in Bosnia since the Second World War.
Bosnia's President Alija Izetbegovic blamed the violence on Serbs opposed to
Bosnian independence, saying they were trying to block international
recognition. He also accused the Serb-led federal army of failing to prevent
fighting.
The fighting follows the heaviest clashes for months in neighbouring
Croatia. Croatian radio said about 27 people were killed in fighting in
eastern Croatia on Friday and the Serb-led Yugoslav army said 25 federal
soldiers and Serb fighters were killed.
EC foreign ministers appear likely to recognise Bosnia's independence later
today. Slovenia and Croatia have already won EC recognition.
Most EC states now seem to believe that the only way to improve the
dangerously unstable situation in Bosnia is to give it the independent
status it voted for by referendum a month ago. The US, which is now seeking
to bring its stance in line with that of the Community, is also pushing for
recognition of Bosnia.
But Spain, and to some degree Germany, argue that the issue of recognising
Bosnia should not be separated from the question of giving similar status to
Macedonia.
Greece has strongly objected to recognising Macedonia under that name, for
fear of stirring Macedonian nationalism in northern Greece. The Portuguese
presidency of the EC has been trying to find a formula to satisfy Greece.
Meanwhile, the first infantry contingent of the UN peacekeeping force sent
to Yugoslavia began deployment in war-torn areas of Croatia yesterday.

FT  06 APR 92 / Bank pay deal sparks warning over German interest rates
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
A 5.8 per cent pay package for German bank workers, agreed after the first
strikes in the sector since the war, roused stern warnings at the weekend of
continued high interest rates and inflation.
It also heightened the prospect of disruptive action by other unions still
negotiating. Average claims in manufacturing and construction are around 10
per cent. A crowd of 700 building workers demonstrating in Hamburg on
Saturday heard their employers' 3.4 per cent offer described as 'a mockery'.
While the bank settlement was below the 6.34 per cent accepted earlier by
steel unions, it was still above the 5.5 per cent upper limit proposed last
autumn - before the severity of the current economic downturn became
apparent - by the government's five leading independent economic advisers.
Mr Rudiger Pohl, one of the so-called five wise men, said yesterday that the
Bundesbank would not be able to reduce interest rates if such settlements
continued. Germany was in danger of becoming locked into long-term
inflation.
In present circumstances, pay awards of 4.5 per cent represented a
'justifiable medium-term limit', he added.
Employers' groups said banks could afford the settlement because they were
making normal profits at present. Other industries were not, and the deal
should not be seen as a model for awards in manufacturing.
The white-collar unions claimed the bank deal, including extra time off and
other concessions, was worth 6.4 per cent overall. A jubilant Mr Gerhard
Renner, chief negotiator for the DAG union, proclaimed the settlement 'a
victory over pay dictatorship'.
Meanwhile, a 10.5 per cent public sector claim and the employers' offer of
3.5 per cent are in arbitration following the collapse of negotiations.
Engineering unions, representing the country's main wealth-creating
industries and asking for 9.5 per cent, have yet to receive any offer.
German inflation peaked last month and should soon be on its way down to
less than 4 per cent before the end of the year, Mr Otmar Issing, chief
economist at the Bundesbank, said yesterday on radio.
However, growth may be weaker than forecast. The official expectation of a
1.5 per cent increase in gross national product this year was still
possible, although it was less likely because the downturn might last longer
than had at first been thought.
Inflation in March reached 4.7 per cent, after an average for last year of
3.5 per cent.

FT  06 APR 92 / Christian Democrat dominance at risk: President Cossiga
leads the way to the polls as Italians put ruling coalition to the test

THROUGHOUT Italy yesterday voters turned up in large numbers to vote in what
was widely seen as the country's most important general election since 1948.
The interior ministry said last night that at the close of polling yesterday
 -the booths reopen today until 2pm - 67 per cent of the 47.4m electorate
had voted. Although this was just under 2 per cent below the figure at the
corresponding time in the 1987 general election, the difference was blamed
on bad weather.
The election campaign, for the 630 seats in the chamber of deputies and the
315 seats in the senate, saw the ruling Christian Democrats on the defensive
with their poor record of recent economic management and failure to carry
out institutional reforms. Against a background of widespread disaffection
and a strong protest vote, for the first time in the post-war era the
party's hegemony over Italian politics looked at risk.
Commentators and polls, albeit unreliable, predicted that the Christian
Democrat-led four-party coalition would lose votes in the north to the
populist Lombard League and the small centre-left Republican party (PRI),
and appeared hard pressed to retain its share of the vote in the centre and
south.
The Christian Democrats and their Socialist, Social Democrat (PSDI) and
Liberal (PLI) allies held 53 per cent of the vote in the outgoing
parliament. If their total vote falls below 49 per cent it will be
impossible to form a new government without turning to one of the nine
groups that became a loosely defined opposition during the election
campaign. The Christian Democrats held 34 per cent of the vote in the 1987
elections and, if the percentage goes below 30 per cent, this would be a big
psychological blow.
Yesterday was the first time Italians had voted without a communist party.
Ms Nilde Iotti, a prominent former communist and president of the senate,
said yesterday: 'Today's vote is the most important for Italy since 1948.'
The authorities reported few serious incidents during polling.
However, voting was overshadowed by the brutal Mafia murder of a senior
Carabiniere officer near Agrigento, Sicily, on Saturday. The officer had
been prominent in a number of investigations into organised crime and his
killing appeared deliberately timed to remind the authorities of the Mafia's
power.
Links between the Mafia and Christian Democrat and Socialist politicians
emerged as a big issue during the elections. The Socialists, who were
fighting to retain their 14.3 per cent of the vote, were also deeply
embarrassed by a corruption scandal in Milan involving Mr Mario Chiesa, a
prominent party supporter. The scandal was expected to dent the Socialist
vote throughout the north.
The ruling parties' main challenge yesterday looked likely to be from the
Lombard League and the Republicans. Mr Umberto Bossi, the league leader,
wound up his campaign on Friday night with a rally in front of Milan
cathedral, reminding his audience that change in Italy had always come from
the north.
The league would be doing well country-wide if it picked up 8 per cent of
the vote.

</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A SURGE of votes for the extreme right stunned Germany's established parties
in two state elections yesterday, with Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian
Democratic Union (CDU) losing its long-held absolute majority in
Baden-Wurttemberg.
Provisional results indicated the Social Democrats (SPD) lost ground in
Schleswig-Holstein but clung to a bare majority of seats.
The rightwing Republicans, who campaigned for tougher laws to keep out
foreign asylum-seekers, got 10.9 per cent of votes in the prosperous,
industrial state of Baden-Wurttemberg, entering parliament in Stuttgart for
the first time.
The far-right German People's Union (DVU) won 6.3 per cent of votes in the
more rural state of Schleswig-Holstein, clearing the 5 per cent hurdle to
enter the state parliament in Kiel.
The main issues - the influx of asylum-seekers, housing, and fear of
unemployment - had been expected to boost the right-wing vote. But the
outcome was more dramatic than expected.
The Republicans attracted support from young working-class people and the
self-employed, according to a survey carried out yesterday. Some 16 per cent
of blue-collar voters and 13 per cent of all those under 30 chose them.
In Schleswig-Holstein, Mr Gerhard Frey, founder-leader of the DVU, said his
party's result was a 'spectacular success', and attributed it to 'the
inability of the old parties to solve the problem of phoney asylum -
seekers'.
He said his party's cause was helped by Bonn's willingness to give up the
D-Mark in the interests of European union. 'We are not against foreigners,
we are for Germans,' he said.
The result is a resounding snub to both Mr Kohl and to Mr Bjorn Engholm, the
Schleswig-Holstein premier and SPD national leader who will challenge Mr
Kohl in 1994.
It also increases pressure on the SPD to go along with curbs on the flow of
asylum-seekers. Some 35,000, a record for a single
month, arrived in March, mostly from Yugoslavia and Romania.
Mr Engholm said: 'These are protest votes and all the major parties must
reflect and ask themselves, 'What we have we done wrong?''
Mr Erwin Teufel, the CDU premier of Baden-Wurttemberg, said he would
consider various coalition possibilities but ruled out co-operation with the
Republicans.
Provisional returns in Baden-Wurttemberg gave the CDU 39 per cent of the
vote (compared with 49 per cent in 1988); SPD 29 (32); Greens 9.5 (7.9); FDP
5.9 (5.9); Republicans 10.9 (1.0).
In Schleswig-Holstein, the SPD saw its 54.8 per cent share of the vote cut
to 46 per cent. The CDU got 33.8 per cent, almost identical to their
previous 33.5 per cent. Election officials said initially the Greens just
cleared the 5 per cent hurdle, but then said they had just failed.

FT  06 APR 92 / Brussels clears big audit firms of being anti-competitive
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LEADING international networks of accountancy firms have been cleared by a
European Commission study of any suggestion of anti-competitive practices.
The study, conducted by a London-based consultancy for the EC competition
directorate, concludes that harmonisation of standards and mutual
recognition of qualifications have 'some way to go' to remove the
'substantial barriers' restricting trade in audit and consulting services
between EC member states.
It warns that any further mergers between the six largest firms in Europe
would demand 'close scrutiny'. It says anxieties about the independence of
auditors are raised by their practice of providing other services, such as
tax advice and management consultancy, to clients.
The report, produced early last year and long awaited by the accountancy
profession, was commissioned in 1989 to investigate whether the largest
firms held monopoly power in the Community.
The directorate said yesterday: 'Accountancy is not a perfect market but it
is not presenting a burning problem to us and there are other priorities at
the moment.'
The news appears to damp fears that the EC might act to prevent mergers
between the big firms, reduce their expansion across member states or bar
them from providing additional services to their audit clients.
Mr Dermot Glynn, managing director of National Economic Research Associates,
which carried out the study, said: 'This is a clean-ish bill of health for
the firms.'
The study shows that the audits of large European companies are heavily
dominated by the international networks of 'big six' firms, and argues that
competitors are excluded because they have fewer resources and are perceived
to offer lower quality. But it suggests these networks - a resource-sharing
mechanism between different national firms - are limited by laws and
professional restrictions which insulate accounting in each EC member state.
The directorate appears to have no intention of breaking up the mergers
which took place in the late 1980s and which reduced the number of very
large firms from eight to six.

FT  06 APR 92 / Threat of UK break-up if Tories lose warns Major
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN MAJOR sought to pull back his government from the verge of defeat in
Thursday's general election with a stark warning yesterday that anything but
a Conservative victory would threaten the break-up of the United Kingdom.
As the opinion polls suggested that Labour would emerge as the largest party
in a 'hung' parliament, Mr Paddy Ashdown hardened his terms for a deal
between the Liberal Democrats and a minority government headed by Mr Neil
Kinnock.
Mr Ashdown admitted that his uncompromising insistence that a coalition
government - with cabinet posts for his party - should legislate immediately
to introduce proportional representation had created tensions with some of
his colleagues.
Reports that Mr Ashdown's terms for an agreement would include a demand for
up to four Cabinet posts were rejected as 'premature' by a senior Liberal
Democrat official last night.
Mr Major's intervention, based on the plans of the two opposition parties
for Scottish devolution and closer European integration, was his most
strident of the campaign. He told a London rally that what was at stake in
the election was 'the birthright' of all British citizens. His opponents
would allow Scotland to break from the United Kingdom and submerge the
sovereignty of Westminster in a united states of Europe. He called on voters
to 'wake up' to the fact that 'the United Kingdom is in danger'.
Senior ministers said that the Conservatives would put the 'threat' to the
Union, alongside the promise of rapid economic recovery if Mr Major is
re-elected, at the centre of their campaign in the final days before April
9.
The prime minister, who underlined again his implacable opposition to
electoral reform, insisted he remained confident of an overall majority at
the election. He suggested that the opinion polls were misreading the mood
among the electorate. But with five out of six polls published yesterday
showing a Labour lead, some senior ministers were ready to concede that the
best the Conservatives could realistically hope for was to emerge as the
largest party after an inconclusive election.
The FT poll of polls shows Labour with the support of 39.4 per cent - little
more than 2 points ahead of the Conservatives - enough to put Mr Kinnock in
Downing Street as leader of the largest party. The Liberal Democrats are put
at 19.4 per cent.
A survey of floating voters conducted by Mori for the BBC suggests that
although Mr Major is still regarded as the most capable potential prime
minister, his campaign has failed to win over voters to the Conservatives.
It also indicates that the party's criticisms of Labour's tax policies have
not so far been effective.
Mr Kinnock yesterday stepped up his offensive to win over more voters in the
centre ground by insisting that a majority Labour government would seek to
govern by consensus. While rejecting any post-election deal with Mr Ashdown,
Mr Kinnock re-emphasised his party's willingness to reform the constitution
and to convene a national debate on changes to the voting system.
He also hinted in a BBC radio interview that Labour was ready to see
proportional representation introduced for elections to the European
parliament.
His conciliatory message was echoed in separate speeches by Mr Roy
Hattersley, deputy leader, and Mr Bryan Gould, shadow environment secretary,
who argued that Labour's approach to electoral reform would seek to build a
'new consensus after a great national debate'.
Labour strategists acknowledged that the pledges were directed at 'soft'
Liberal Democrat supporters who needed to be persuaded that Mr Kinnock was
committed to constitutional change. They are also intended to capitalise on
disquiet among some Scottish Liberal Democrats at the uncompromising stance
being adopted by Mr Ashdown.
Mr Charles Kennedy and Sir David Steel are said to be among senior
colleagues who believe that in the event of a hung parliament, the party
might have to soften its stance. Yesterday, however, Mr Ashdown said he
would be willing to force a second general election if his terms were not
met. Those terms included seats in the cabinet in any coalition.
Mr Major signalled a determined effort to 'squeeze' the third party vote,
warning that a vote for Mr Ashdown would allow Mr Kinnock into Downing
Street.
Drawing on the overwhelming backing that the Conservatives have received
from the business community, Mr Major said the choice at the end of this
week would be between a government which promised recovery and a socialist
party which would deepen the recession.

FT  06 APR 92 / Fears about sterling lead to ERM deal on escudo
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER and PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FEARS of a run on sterling ahead of Thursday's UK general election were
behind an agreement reached this weekend and linked to today's entry by the
Portuguese escudo into the European exchange rate mechanism (ERM).
At a meeting in Brussels, Britain argued successfully that the central rate
for the escudo should be higher than originally proposed.
This was on the basis that a high rate would limit the possibilities of a
rapid rise in value of the Portuguese unit that could put pressure on the
pound.
The escudo's ERM entry comes at the start of tense week for the sterling as
the foreign exchange markets contemplate a change in the UK government.
There have been fears that investors will switch large volumes of money out
of sterling because of nervousness about a Labour administration or a hung
parliament.
Officials from the 12 European Community nations took eight hours on
Saturday to agree a central rate for the escudo of 178.735 to the European
currency unit, and 86.94 against the D-Mark.
Lisbon had wanted a lower rate, of 180 escudos to the Ecu and 87.6 to the
D-Mark.
The agreement was designed to meet the concerns of Britain and other EC
nations that a lower rate could mean the escudo rises rapidly to to the top
of its alloted ERM band. Even though the escudo is relatively lightly
traded, such a development could put pressure on other currencies in the
system - particularly the pound, which is the weakest ERM member.
Entry into the ERM will mean all 12 EC nations except Greece have their
currencies pegged to each other around set limits tied to the D-Mark. The
system is designed to damp inflation by restricting currency depreciation.
'A strong escudo certainly helps in the fight against inflation and interest
rates should fall less hesitantly than they have until now,' Jorge Braga de
Macedo, Portuguese finance minister, said.
Participants in Saturday's meeting said Portugal's suggested rate had been
altered for the overall stability of the ERM grid.

<TEXT>
once the world leader in light rail systems - was reached in 1916, by which
time 18,000 miles of track were installed in urban areas. In the UK, by
1920, there were 14,000 trams in operation.
But despite important advances in tramway technology, especially between
1930 and 1950, these developments failed to stop the accelerating trend in
tramway decline, mostly due to economic pressures upon operators.
Today, the only evidence of many once-famous light rail systems is to be
found in transport museums.
What is claimed to be the world's most popular tramway collection is the
UK's National Tramway Museum at Crich, located 15 miles north of Derby and
six miles from Matlock, which last year attracted 133,000 visitors -
achieving a higher figure than many larger transport museums in the US.
There are 50 electric and horse-drawn trams at Crich, of which 20 are still
operational. Most have been painstakingly restored by staff and enthusiastic
volunteers.
Beyond the UK, there are specialist museums in the US, Australia, New
Zealand, Sweden, Holland and Prague.
The world's oldest tramway collection is the Seashore Trolley Museum,
founded in the US in 1939, at Kennebunkport, in the state of Maine - which,
incidentally, is very close to retreat of President George Bush. The
Seashore Museum is one of 80 light rail museums in the US, but the largest
tram display in the US, in terms of rolling stock, is at Union, Illinois, 60
miles west of Chicago.
One of Britain's most famous operational tramways is in Blackpool,
Lancashire. Opened in 1885, this was the first street tramway in the UK; it
ran on electric current, fed to cars via steel-troughing in the road.
In South Wales, a famous tramway operation - similar to Blackpool's - ceased
to run in Swansea in January 1960; known as the Swansea and Mumbles Railway,
it was the first passenger-carrying rail service in the world.
Although it began as a horse-drawn operation in 1807, the system was
electrified in 1929. The service ran from the centre of Swansea along the
bay to Oystermouth and Mumbles Head.
In Cardiff, where the last electric tram ran on February 20, 1950, the
corporation issued souvenir tickets with a nostalgic verse on the back.
It read:
Goodbye my friends, this is the end; I've travelled miles and miles,
And watched your faces through the years,
show anger, tears and smiles,
Although you've criticised my looks - and said I was too slow,
I got you there and brought you back, through rain and sleet and snow.
Today, however, a consultant's study for a new Pounds 100m bus/tram scheme
is under consideration for Cardiff. The plan is based on a Belgium-designed
guided light travel system that operates as a bus and a rail network.
For researchers, the libraries and archives of the National Tramway Museum
and the London Transport Museum are both outstanding sources of reference
for urban transport history.*
Along with long-distance rail networks, local light rail systems helped to
revolutionise economic and social life in cities as people travelled easily
outside their own districts for business and pleasure.
What is known as a trolley car or streetcar in the US is called a tram in
the UK. However, defining a light rail system is not easy - but as a chief
inspector of railways said in the mid-1970s: 'It's a light railway if I say
it's a light railway.'
What is evident, however, is that these systems have a colourful history.
For example:
The tramcar was introduced to Britain from the US in 1860 and marked a great
advance on the contemporary horse-bus, (introduced in Paris in 1819).
Tramcars with rails gave a far smoother ride than road vehicles of the day.
The cable car, invented by Andrew Hallidie, was introduced in San Francisco
in 1873. Cars were drawn by cables running between rails.
In Italy, the famous steam tramway between Milan and Magenta opened in 1879
 -and operated until 1957.
Electric street tramways appeared in Berlin in 1881 and became popular in
many cities.
The UK's first electric street tram ran at Leytonstone, east London, in
March 1882.
In the US on May 9, 1900, striking transport workers blew up a tramcar
during riots in St. Louis.
That same year, in London on June 27, London's Central Railway 'Tuppeny
Tube' first ran from Shepherd's Bush, in west London, to the Bank.
Japan's first electric tramway was opened by an American company in Kyoto in
the early 1890s.
Fifty striking tram crew members were sentenced to decapitation in Shanghai,
China, in April 1927.
Paris closed its streetcar lines in the 1930s; London's last tram ran in
July, 1952; Leeds tramways closed in 1959.

FT  06 APR 92 / Survey of Light Rail Systems (6): Revival of interest in
North America - Cities that left their old rail systems in situ are now
applauded by planners
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KAREN ZAGOR

<TEXT>
LIGHT RAIL systems are undergoing a revival in north America as many big
cities try to battle gridlocked streets and automotive pollution - decades
after they tore out their tram lines in favour cars, buses and highways.
Los Angeles, Sacramento, Dallas, Austin, Baltimore and Miami are among the
US cities in various stages of planning or constructing new light rail
systems. This surge of interest in light rail public transport reflects
growing congestion in the cities and increasing legislation to limit
automobile-related air pollution.
Los Angeles, with some of the nation's most congested streets and most
polluted air, is spending Dollars 150bn on a 30-year public transportation
project. When it is completed, Los Angeles's mass transit rail network will
be second only to New York's. The first completed portion of the project - a
'Blue line' light rail service between Long Beach and downtown Los Angeles -
has been running for more than a year. The Los Angeles transportation
commission says the number of daily riders greatly exceeds its first year
forecasts. The commission had expected 10,000 riders a day, but the figure
is closer to 35,000.
Cities that left their light rail systems in situ are now being applauded by
city planners for that decision. The streetcar system in Toronto is
considered by many to be a model of how light rail can work effectively as
part of an integrated public transportation system.
The city's first street car route was inaugurated 120 years ago on Younge
Street. The early, horse-drawn streetcars carried 55,000 passengers a day by
1891.
During the 1960s, Toronto, like many other north American cities, had a
programme to phase out streetcars. Some were eliminated, but the full
programme was never implemented and by the early 1970s a decision was made
to leave the remaining system in place.
According to Mr Ian Kingston, an engineer at the Toronto Transportation
Commission (TTC), streetcars have a bigger capacity than buses, making them
a preferable means of public transportation on some routes.
Speed is also an advantage for streetcars operating on private right-of-ways
 -'but speed is more limited on streets with mixed traffic,' he says.
Indeed, the main disadvantage of streetcars are their inability to drive
around accidents and traffic jams. Advocates of streetcars often point to
Portland, Oregon, as a model city. In Portland, streetcars have the right of
way on city street. Drivers can over-ride street lights using a mechanical
control to change the lights.
According to the TTC, about 568,000 passengers travel on Toronto's subway
every day, while about 900,000 passengers use surface transportation. The
city does not break out the number of tram riders but the TTC runs 260
street cars which can carry up to 208 passengers apiece. About 22 of these
cars date to the 1930s and were recently restored by TTC staff. The city
hopes that the older, period cars will attract tourists to the system. In
Toronto, the streetcar is just one leg of the city's integrated
transportation system. There are ten streetcar routes covering 47 miles of
route or about 94 miles of track, since each route needs two way tracks.
'In many cases people use the streetcars at the start or end of their trips
as they travel to and from the subway,' says a TTC spokesman. The city,
which has long abandoned its plans to abolish the system, is now looking at
the next generation of streetcars which will have a low floor so that
passengers won't have to climb up three steps.
Putting in new systems, however, is considerably more difficult than
up-grading an existing network. Controversy surrounds virtually any effort
in the US to build new public transport systems. The problems begin at the
Federal level, with funding for mass transit currently at the centre of a
political budget battle.
President George Bush's budget proposal would cut funding for surface
transportation that was allocated in a recently-passed bill. The proposal is
meeting opposition from several public transit authorities.
On the local level, new transport systems have become the focus of debate
over urban planning and state funding. In Los Angeles, for example, plans
for one leg of the city's light rail system became a lightening rod for
mounting anti-Japanese sentiments fueled by frustrations over rising
unemployment and the trade imbalance between the US and Japan. The city
recently scrapped a Dollars 128m contract for driverless cars with Sumitomo
of Japan, largely because of US/Japanese trade tensions.
And there is also the problem of weaning travellers from their cars. In San
Francisco, for example, extra bus, ferry and train services were introduced
in the wake of the 1989 earthquake which damaged some of the region's major
freeways. But commuters are now back in their cars and public transport
services are being scaled down to pre-earthquake levels.
Even Los Angeles's successful Blue line does not carry enough passengers to
make a serious dent in traffic or pollution. But as Los Angeles and other
cities press ahead with their transport plans, light rail systems will
become an increasingly important part of public transportation in the US in
1990s.

FT  06 APR 92 / Survey of Light Rail Systems (4): Larger European suppliers
now think in global terms - Equipment Manufacturers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES ABBOTT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LAST five years has been an era of massive consolidation within Europe's
railway manufacturing industry. Large businesses have been swallowing up
their smaller rivals, with the electrical engineering companies - whose
products make up the high value components of trains and trams - driving the
deals.
To date, most railway procurement in Europe has been nationalistically
driven, but the advent of the single European market increases the scope for
cross-border deals.
Most of the large companies now think in European, or indeed global, terms.
Overshadowing the market now are two huge multinational groups,
Swedish-Swiss Asea Brown Boveri and Anglo-French GEC-Alsthom. These two have
built up extensive railway manufacturing portfolios including signalling as
well as traction; both have annual turnover of the order of Pounds 1bn.
ABB's Zurich plant is a significant producer of electrical equipment for
light rail vehicles, and the company has important manufacturing capacity in
Germany and Sweden - plus a stake in Brel, the former state-owned railway
workshops in Britain.
GEC-Alsthom is famed as builder of France's high-speed TGV, but it also made
the vehicles for the showpiece Grenoble tramway - and there are more such
cars under construction for a new light rail route in northern Paris.
Meanwhile, the British side of the consortium has been a driving force
behind the Manchester Metrolink project. The group owns factories in Spain
and Belgium and has a collaboration agreement with the railway arm of Fiat
in Italy.
Competing with these two multinationals are some large German companies.
Siemens, a long-standing supplier of electrical equipment, has been
expanding into mechanical engineering.
Three years ago it bought a majority holding in Dusseldorf-based Duewag, one
of the largest light rail vehicle builders in the world and a major
beneficiary of the light rail renaissance in North America.
Siemens has a foothold in the growing British market with a deal to build
the vehicles for the Sheffield Supertram project. It could also acquire
electrical equipment manufacturing capacity in this country: it has already
expressed an interest in the rail side of Hawker Siddeley, should BTR decide
to divest itself of this part of its recent purchase at some point in the
future.
Acquisitions
Recent acquisitions by Siemens include a 51 per cent stake in Skoda of
Czechoslovakia, a builder of electric locomotives which Siemens intends to
expand to build suburban and metro trains as well, and a minority holding in
SGP, one of the principal railway vehicle builders in Austria.
The railway activities of the Daimler-Benz empire have been consolidated
under the AEG-Westinghouse umbrella, a collaborative venture in which
Westinghouse of the US owns 19 per cent. This group makes airport
people-movers and also owns MAN-GHH of Nuremberg, which manufactures for the
light rail sector.
The third force in the German light rail market is Salzgitter-based Linke
Hofmann Busch, which made the original cars for the Docklands Light Railway
in London.
While the Americans virtually vacated the passenger railway manufacturing
field in their flight to the car in the 1960s and 1970s and now largely have
to rely on European and Japanese technology, the Canadians retain a stake in
the shape of Bombardier of Montreal.
This aerospace and railway conglomerate has been buying up European
manufacturing capacity and owns BN of Bruges, Belgium, an important supplier
in the light rail field; the company is building 70 new vehicles to the
Docklands Light Railway.
The Swiss, with their well-respected tramway operations, have niche
suppliers of vehicles, although high labour costs limit the opportunity for
exports.
Vehicle-builder Vevey has recently signed a collaborative agreement with
French electronics firm Matra, whose automatic mini-metro systems have won
acceptance in town centres such as Lille and in airport operations.
The Italians have gained a name for low-cost vehicle building; Breda has
built for a number of US cities, and Firema was sub-contracted by
GEC-Alsthom to build the vehicles for the Manchester Metrolink.
Subsidies from the Italian government lower export prices, but efforts to
spread the political dividend can raise costs; for instance the Manchester
order, amounting to just 26 vehicles, was spread over three factories.
An important contender in the low-cost field is CKD Tatra of Prague, which
it is reckoned has built one out of every three tramcars in the world,
thanks to the dominance of tramways in the former east bloc.
The introduction of dollar trading there has shattered that market, and
Tatra is now seeking to penetrate western Europe. It already has a car
undergoing trials on the Oslo tram system. Tatra has a new design of car due
to make its debut in Prague this spring.
This will interest many cities as much of its floor is at a low level, to
help boarding by elderly and disabled people - and the new vehicle thus
competes directly with low-floor designs produced by western European
builders.
Thanks to a huge new factory built in the last years of Communist rule and
low labour costs, the Czech company is able to offer attractive prices; it
is now seeking a joint venture with one of the western European majors to
gain access to new technology.
Conspicuous mainly by their absence are the Japanese. Their penetration of
the railway market has not been anything as pervasive as it has been in the
automotive field.
In the main European countries they have found it difficult to obtain a
foothold, although one recent success has been Kawasaki's contract to supply
bogies for the new trains for London's Central Line.
Japanese companies have had a greater presence in the US market, but this is
now threatened by a wave of protectionist sentiment.
In January, a contract with Sumitomo to construct cars for Los Angeles' new
Green Line was cancelled, and local politicians are now seeking to build
their own factory in Los Angeles to make the vehicles.

FT  06 APR 92 / Survey of Light Rail Systems (5): Big benefits of
integration - Case study, Vienna's successful light rail underground and
tram services score highly for reliability and frequency
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

VIENNA'S figures speak for themselves. In the decade to 1990, there was an
increase of nearly 36 per cent in the numbers of passengers using its public
transport system. The numbers rose from 450.7m people carried in 1981 to
611.8m in 1990.
This was in spite of an increase in numbers of cars in the city from 476,553
to 546,945 - up 15 per cent. The city's population grew slightly from 1.53m
to 1.56m in the same period. Public transport in the Austrian capital was
good, is good and is getting better.
It consists of a well-integrated system of trams, underground trains, other
light rail vehicles, and buses. Single passes cover all forms of transport.
There are no conductors, but stiff fines for fare-dodgers caught by
inspectors. The system is reliable, with intervals as low as three minutes
between services for much of each day.
It is the development of the underground that has transformed usage. There
are now five lines and the network they form is being gradually extended or
is having its gaps filled in. There are more than 40km of it now, but it has
not come cheaply: the first three lines cost AS 18.4bn (Pounds 876m) at
current prices between 1967 and 1983, while the next two cost AS 23m (Pounds
1.1bn) at current prices in the 1980s. Another AS 15.5bn (Pounds 740m) of
public money has been made available for development in 1991-2000. There are
more than 40km of it now, and about AS 15.5bn (Pounds 740m) of public money
has been made available for development in 1991-2000.
The promise of an improved public transport system was one of the factors
which helped persuade the United Nations to open its third major centre,
after New York and Geneva, in Vienna during the 1970s - along with having Dr
Kurt Waldheim, now president of Austria, as UN secretary-general at the
time.
Several agencies, including those for drug control and industrial
development, moved there. UNO City - part of a large, impressive complex of
modern buildings that form the Vienna International Centre on what was once
an island in the Danube - also houses the International Atomic Energy
Agency.
The U1, the first underground line to be built, services the complex, which
also includes the Austria Centre, a conference venue. The U1 runs from near
the Sudbahnhof, a main railway terminus in the south of the city, to Kagran,
on the east bank of Danube, passing under the city centre, where it links
with three other underground lines and a host of tram and bus services.
The city centre itself is ringed cleverly by the underground. A western
semi-circle is covered on a shuttle basis by the short U2 line, servicing
the university, Rathaus, principal theatres and, via a shop-filled
underground pedestrian passageway, the Opera.
The eastern semi-circle is on the U4, which starts in the northern suburbs
at Heiligenstadt by the Danube and loops round the city centre to take a
westward route along line of the river Wien, past the Schobrunn Palace, to
the Vienna woods.
Under construction and now partly open, the new U3 also passes under the
city centre, in this case roughly east-west. Its extension to the
Westbahnhof, the main intercity terminus, will open next year, providing a
much-needed link between the station and the U1.
The Westbahnhof itself is on the Gurtel, the middle ring road around the
city. The U6, the remaining underground line follows this, having been
developed out of the light rail Stadtbahn and officially reborn as the U6 in
1989.
Vienna's main light rail system, however, remains the Strassenbahn - the
tram. There are 247.5km of tramways, 35 routes and 991 tram stops. Some
short-term residents in the city have found an easy means of learning their
way round the city by taking a new tram route to its destination and back on
Sundays.
There are no trams in the city centre itself, which is ringed, literally, by
the Ring, a wide road built in the last century along the line of the
encircling city walls after they had been demolished to allow Vienna, then a
thriving imperial capital, to expand more easily.
One tram service goes round the Ring clockwise, another anti-clockwise, with
several stops linking to underground stations. The city centre itself is
almost entirely 'walkable,' but is also criss-crossed by mini-bus services.
To help passengers, there is a complimentary and comprehensive map of the
city with all underground, tram, bus and regional commuter railway services
imposed on it. It resembles a spider's web but colour-coding makes it easy
to follow.
The general pattern of changing usage has been for tram passengers to
decline slightly from more than 250m in 1981, when Stadtbahn (now the U6)
figures were included, to 241.9m in 1990. But use of the Stadtbahn leapt
from 28.7m in 1989 to 43m in 1990 after its conversion to the U6.
The shift and increase in
new passengers has been to the faster underground as the network has
developed. The 106.7m underground passengers of 1981 had swelled to 202.8m
in 1990, not including the 43m who used the U6 that year. Bus travel also
increased - from 83m to 124m over the decade.
However, it is the figure for
rides per population which show true popularity. In 1990, underground and
trams were neck and with figures of 157 and 155 respectively, compared with
79 for buses.
Vienna also has a route that runs on the railway as well as through the
streets - the Lokalbahn service between the Opera and Baden, 20 miles to the
south.
This version of the supertram has vehicles the same size as normal trams,
but with a different seating configuration, and more comfortable seats for
the longer journey.
The ultimate test of any city's public transport infrastructure, however, is
whether it is possible to live there without a car. In fact, many who work
for the UN, who do not need to travel round in the course of their work, and
who live in or near the city centre, do so. Even Shopping City Sud, the main
out-of-town retail centre, is served by the Lokalbahn to Baden. Some village
inns and restaurants on the outskirts are easier to reach by car, but most
are easily accessible by tram or bus.
Even when a car is needed for normal family uses or work, it is much more
possible to manage with just one per household than the two which are
necessary for an equivalent professional lifestyle in many parts of Britain.
Vienna's successful light rail underground and tram systems are what make
these things possible. Their impact is therefore much wider socially and
economically than just shifting people about.

FT  06 APR 92 / Survey of Light Rail Systems (3): New era for the tram in
larger UK cities - Urban transport solutions, lessons drawn from Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES ABBOTT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE OPENING of the Manchester light rail system sees trams finally return to
the streets of Britain's great cities. After the Second World War the notion
of street-running of railway systems was seen as cumbersome and intrusive,
and trams were replaced by motor buses in one city after another.
London's last tram ran in July 1952 and the last system to close was
Glasgow's, in September 1962 - leaving Britain bereft of trams, save for a
few ferrying tourists by the sea in Blackpool; (see page 4: Gone but not
forgotten).
The opening of the new era of the tram in Britain can be dated to a 1982
report into the options for a new railway to regenerate the London
Docklands. Transport planners working on the report drew lessons from cities
in Europe, such as Amsterdam and Zurich, that had retained and improved
their tram systems.
They proposed a new light rail system for east London which would feature
street running, including a stretch down the busy Mile End Road. As it
turned out, when it opened in 1987 the Docklands Light Railway did not
include any street running.
At the behest of the London Docklands Development Corporation, the new
railway was built as a highly-visible automatic system, wholly-segregated
from the streets on elevated track, with the aim of promoting the image of
high-tech regeneration of the area. But the fact that London Transport - the
premier urban transport operator in the country - had been thinking about
street-running tramways in the early 1980s altered perceptions of the idea
elsewhere in the country.
'We knew the big boys were thinking about it, so it must be OK,' commented
one planner in Manchester who began the conceptual studies for what was to
become the city's Metrolink system.
By the late 1980s, with construction underway on the Manchester system,
cities and towns throughout the UK began to see the modern tram as the
solution to their transport ills. By early 1990, 50 UK towns either had firm
plans or were considering proposals for a street-running light rail system,
with towns as small as Gloucester and Chatham hankering after modern trams.
But coming as they do with a price tag of Pounds 100m or more apiece, it
soon became clear that far from all these systems could be afforded - and,
as this realisation has sunk in, the promoters of some of the more marginal
schemes have begun to think in terms of cheaper options such as enhanced bus
priorities.
However, the government has indicated that the taxpayer can afford to start
one new light rail project each year, so some of the larger UK cities now
have a real chance of regaining their trams. System number two after
Manchester will be Sheffield, where main contractors Balfour Beatty have
already begun building the Pounds 230m 'Supertram' line from the city centre
to the Meadowhall shopping and sports complex.
Siemens is providing the vehicles which are expected to enter service on the
first section of line at the end of next year, with completion of a 29km
system in 1994.
In contrast to Manchester, which used mainly former British Rail lines,
Sheffield's system is mostly new alignments on streets. Next in the queue is
Birmingham, which has ambitious plans for a light rail network extending to
200km.
Detailed planning is underway on the first 21km route, which will use an old
railway alignment between the centre of Birmingham and Wolverhampton - 1995
is the best bet for an opening date. Modern trams could return to the
capital if Croydon's Tramlink proposals come to fruition. A Parliamentary
bill was deposited last November as the first stage to gaining planning
approval for a three-line, 29km system.
One hurdle to be jumped is the Pounds 140m cost: with so much Treasury money
going into the conventional railway system in London, there is a strong
predisposition in Whitehall to favour provincial light rail schemes in
preference to any in the capital. In Croydon's favour, though, are projected
passenger loadings of a completely different order to those expected in the
northern cities. Indeed, revenue could be as much as double Tramlink's
operating costs - which has led to hopes that just a little seed money from
public sources could tempt the private sector to shoulder much of the cost.
In the provinces, jostling behind Birmingham are Nottingham and Leeds, both
of which deposited Parliamentary bills last November. Nottingham's proposal
is interesting in that it could provide the first example in Britain of
light rail vehicles (modern trams) intermingling with British Rail trains on
the same track - an idea which has been shunned on safety grounds so far,
but which modern signalling systems could make feasible.
The practice is being pioneered in Karlsruhe, Germany, where light rail
vehicles already run on German Railways tracks. One scheme that was a
frontrunner in the British light rail race - but has slipped behind - is
Bristol's Avon Metro.
This is being promoted by a joint venture of private and public sector
interests who had an agreement with local bus company Badgerline, which was
earmarked to operate the trams. Badgerline has since broken-off to promote
its own scheme using guided bus technology from Belgian firm BN (now part of
Bombardier Europe), and it is unclear which system will win.
Also in the queue for funds is Manchester's Phase Two, which would see
Metrolink trams reach Trafford Park, Oldham and Rochdale. The cities so far
mentioned are the most likely candidates to gain latterday trams. Several
others - including Edinburgh, Kingston in the London suburbs and Glasgow -
have advanced plans, with the latter in particular having a fair chance of
seeing rails in the streets again by the end of the decade.
There is more realism in the British light rail movement about the chances
of getting projects built than there was a couple of years ago - and the
industry is now maturing beyond 'the flavour of the month' into a rational
answer to urban transport problems.

FT  06 APR 92 / Survey of Light Rail Systems (2): Supertrams will run on
rail lines and through streets - Expanding network planned for Manchester's
Metrolink
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MANCHESTER'S new light rail link should be fully operational by the end of
June - 153 years after the city first publicly acknowledged it needed
something to do the job for which Metrolink is designed.
Although the first scheduled service of the Metrolink supertrams is due to
begin today, it will only be between Bury, about seven miles to the north,
and Manchester's Victoria Station, on the edge of the city centre. After
four weeks of settling down, the trams will be able carry on from Victoria,
arcing south and west through city centre streets to Deansgate Station.
Another four weeks, and Metrolink supertrams will start running on to
Altrincham eight miles to the south, and back again to Bury. This will
enable the city centre to be traversed by rail by through travellers, rather
than just skirted, for the first time. Four more weeks later, in June, a
spur will link the city centre's main shopping area with Piccadilly Station.
Where Metrolink is differs from most other tram systems is that its vehicles
can run both on normal railway lines and through the streets. This means
that Greater Manchester's mainly radial rail system will start to be
transformed into a genuine network.
It has been a long time coming. Manchester boasts the world's first railway
station, built in 1835 at Liverpool Road, and now part of a complex of
science, engineering and heritage museums in the city centre.
It was the terminus for George Stephenson's railway between Liverpool and
Manchester, then the fastest form of transportation on earth. It was a
breakthrough that speeded up the industrial revolution, but as with many
other important technological developments in the history of the world,
Manchester was soon to prove that being first was not always an advantage.
In the course of the next 30 years, the city centre became ringed by railway
termini, all separated from each other. Indeed, even before Piccadilly and
Victoria Stations were built in 1842 and 1844 respectively, a rail tunnel
was proposed to link the two embryonic stations on which they were based. It
was never built; only this June will Metrolink start doing the job envisaged
so long ago. Viaducts provide some inadequate links, but Manchester
generally became a place where people went to by train. From 1877 they were
able to get on horse-drawn trams to move about the city and connect between
termini. In 1901, electric trams replaced the horses.
In the same year, the first circular tube railway around the city centre was
mooted at a cost of Pounds 1.5m. Nothing materialised. The idea was raised
again in 1912 but lapsed with the First World War, although the Bury line
was electrified.
By 1928, a Pounds 14m underground network was being considered, with links
to Salford, Stretford and Prestwich. Two years later and the cost was up
Pounds 20m for a 35-mile network with inner and outer circles and radial
routes.
Post-war priorities
Although the line to Altrincham was electrified in 1931, the slump and the
Second World War put paid to any chances of the idea going ahead and in 1944
Manchester city council decided against a Pounds 38m, 24-mile underground
railway because there were greater priorities for post-war reconstruction.
The tram era came to end throughout Greater Manchester between 1949 and
1951, but trolley buses continued until 1966. Meanwhile, Piccadilly Station
was modernised in 1959, confirming its position as Manchester's main
intercity terminus, but still unlinked to Victoria, less than a mile to the
north and the main east-west station for the conurbation.
The age of the car and road transport had fully dawned. A measure of rail's
decline is that although, by 1973, the forerunner to what is now the Greater
Manchester Passenger Transport Executive (GMPTE) was still proposing a
Pounds 160m tunnel to link the two main stations and form the base for a
20-mile light rapid transit network, the total cost of Pounds 160m was only
a quarter of the highways budget for the same period, but was considered
prohibitive.
The tunnel proposal was eventually dropped by Greater Manchester Council in
1977, although Councillor Jack Flanagan, chairman of the Metrolink working
party, says that some still nurtured hopes for it as late as 1985.
In 1979, a new study was started by British Rail, GMPTE and the Department
of Transport. The problem it addresssed was the same one that had been
confronting people for 140 years: ways had to be found to fill missing rail
links in Manchester city centre and turn Greater Manchester's suburban,
radial rail routes into a regional network.
A surface rail link, sweeping round the western fringe of the city centre
between Salford and Deansgate, was approved by the government in 1985 and
since 1988 has provided a through route across the conurbation between Wigan
and Stockport.
The supertram concept of Metrolink also emerged from the study.
Parliamentary powers were sought in 1984. The government promised to give
money provided the private sector was involved. Development of the Deebom
principle ensured this and the Bill passed its final stages in 1988. The
contract to design, build, operate and maintain the system was signed two
years ago.
Mr Roger Hall, deputy director-general of Metrolink, forecasts 10m passenger
journeys a year - 4m each between Bury and Altrincham and 2m within the city
centre.
The value to the city has already been recognised by the Central Manchester
Development Corporation, which has put money into one of the five city
centre stations.
These themselves are distinctive, with a 'camel's hump' shape so that people
who cannot easily use steps - including parents with pushchairs  - can get
up the gentle slope of the platform to its apex, level with each supertram's
floor. Access from elsewhere on the platform is by retractable step.
The 26 supertrams will come at five-minute intervals in the rush hour, every
10 minutes at other times. There will be no conductors, but ticket
inspection will be vigorous, with Pounds 10 on-the-spot fines for fare
dodgers. Ticket machines have been installed at every station and multi-ride
tickets will be widely available.
Five future routes are already envisaged, providing supertram links to
Oldham and Rochdale in the conurbation's east and north-east,
Chorlton-cum-Hardy and Didsbury in the south, Marple in the south-east,
Glossop in the east and Salford Quays and Trafford Park in the west.
A new route into east Manchester to serve the stadia planned there - whether
Manchester's bid for the 2000 Olympics succeeds or not - is also envisaged.
The franchises to operate any or all of these will also be open to bidding
by private sector consortia.
Long term, the impact on Greater Manchester - a conurbation of more than
2.5m people ' should be telling, particularly since Metrolink will improve
access by public transport to Piccadilly station and the planned rail link
from there to Manchester Airport.
Generally, however, a proper, efficient, public mass-transit system is
essential to Manchester's development as Britain's second financial and
professional centre after London and the widening recognition of it as the
capital of northern England. The road infrastructure remains generally good,
but most routes are crowded in rush hours and capacity limits will
eventually jam up the city for long periods, hindering its development.
A remaining problem, however, will be the widespread British one of lack of
co-ordination between different public transport services. The effect of bus
deregulation is seen by Metrolink's political leadership as 'complete
disaster,' with more buses competing for fewer passengers, charging higher
fares and running more 'dead' miles nearly empty.
Greater Manchester Buses, a 12.35 per cent shareholder in Metrolink, has had
to face a series of redundancies and fare rises recently to stay solvent.
Against this background, spreading Metrolink's net as quickly as possible,
and running it hard and at full capacity cannot come too soon.

FT  06 APR 92 / Survey of Light Rail Systems (1): Manchester's Metrolink - a
testbed for Britain / The tram is making a comeback in the UK, while more
than 300 tramway and light rail systems are already operating in Europe and
the US

IT is nothing short of a transport revolution. Exactly 30 years after
Britain's last street-running trams (other than those in the seaside resort
of Blackpool) made their final journeys to the sheds, the tram is making a
comeback - not as the slow, clanking beast of old, but as a sleek, fast and
efficient form of modern transport.
Today, after several months of delays, the first 10-mile section of
Manchester's new light rail system is due to open. Called Metrolink, it
heralds a new era for public transport in Britain: for unlike earlier light
rail schemes such as the Tyne &amp; Wear Metro and the Docklands Light Railway,
the system (pictured, right) will see modern-day tram cars mixing with
people and traffic on the streets of the city centre.
In one sense, this is nothing new. It is more than 100 years since the
world's first electric tramcars went into operation on the streets of
Blackpool in 1885. By the First World War, trams served more than 120 towns
and cities throughout the UK, reaching their peak in the late 1920s when
there were about 14,000 tramcars in service. The pattern was repeated
throughout the developed world.
It was the growth of the motor bus which was the tram's undoing. By the end
of the Second World War, much of the tramway infrastructure installed
earlier in the century was overdue for costly replacement. Low petrol prices
made its replacement with motor buses a cheap alternative.
Outside Blackpool, where trams were seen as a tourist draw, tramways in
Britain went into decline. The last one, in Glasgow, closed in 1962. In
North America, they were retained in several cities, but investment was low
and usage declined. France, Spain and most of Italy saw their tramways go.
Only in Germany, Belgium, Holland, Switzerland and Austria were tramways
retained and developed.
Now, however, the tram has come back into favour. Where once it was regarded
as a noisy, slow and down-market means of transport reviled for obstructing
other road users, perceptions have drastically changed.
Today's tram bears little resemblance to its predecessor. More like a small
train than the old wooden double deckers, it typically consists of a pair of
single-deck cars running comfortably and quietly at speeds of up to 50 mph
once it clears the city centre streets.
No longer is the tram regarded as an obstacle. Just the opposite: it is now
promoted as a means of tempting people out of their cars and back on to
public transport to help provide a solution to ever-worsening traffic
congestion.
Because it is electrically powered, the tram is seen as environmentally
friendly. It can also be used as a means of stimulating regeneration in
depressed inner city areas, as with the Docklands Light Railway; and it adds
a certain amount of prestige to a city's image.
It is this combination of factors which has led to a resurgence of interest
in light rail. More than 300 systems are operating on the European Continent
and in North America, with the tally growing fast. In the UK, such is the
enthusiasm for them that about 40 towns and cities have projects on the
drawing boards.
Getting those schemes off the drawing boards and on to the streets, however,
can sometimes prove problematic. The UK has lagged far behind the rest of
Europe in translating the dreams of its city planners into reality. The
Docklands Light Railway and Tyne &amp; Wear Metro were mainly conversions of
existing 'heavy' railway lines. All but the city centre sections of
Manchester's Metrolink system, too, comprise former British Rail suburban
lines. Projects involving large-scale construction of new infrastructure are
proving much more difficult to progress.
The main obstacle is cash. Building new tramway systems is an expensive
business (the first Metrolink line is costing more than Pounds 130m). In
most cases it is too much to hope that the likely revenue streams from a
completed light rail project will come close to covering the construction
and financing costs, still less provide the promoter with a reasonable
return. The result is that promoters - in most cases, local authorities -
can only hope to proceed with the projects if they obtain central government
grants towards the capital costs.
These grants - known as Section 56 grants because they are awarded under
Section 56 of the Transport Act 1968 - are very difficult to procure. The
government starts from the view that, where possible, public transport
should be self-financing.
Where it is satisfied that overriding social objectives make an otherwise
unviable project desirable, it is prepared to consider a grant: but in doing
so, it requires the social benefits to be quantified in financial terms, and
it will only include non-user benefits in the equation. (Users, it is
assumed, will be ready to pay the full value of their benefits through the
fare-box.)
The main non-user benefit is relief of congestion to road users, but local
authorities also try to quantify benefits to industry or such nebulous
factors as enhancement of a city's image. The difficulty of quantifying such
benefits leaves the Department of Transport endless scope for quibbling over
the calculations and turning down applications. Even when an application
succeeds, it then has to join a long queue of other public sector projects
awaiting funds from a tight-fisted Treasury.
Critics contrast the system applied to new road schemes, where the absence
of any direct mechanism for charging motorists means a different system of
assessment has to be adopted. In this case, the user benefits are counted,
mainly by putting a financial value on the time savings accruing to
motorists. The department's forecasts of traffic growth make this such an
easy test to pass that few road schemes ever fail it: so with the
department's budget for road schemes more than 100 times greater than its
budget for light rail schemes (more than Pounds 2bn a year compared with
Pounds 20m a year), it is not surprising that many more roads than light
railways are built.
What local authorities in Britain would like to see is something more akin
to the Continental system, where public transport and road schemes are
assessed on a comparable basis. The result of ern Europe's cities with
populations of more than 600,000 already have some form of tram or light
rail system. In Britain, only two schemes are in the pipeline after
Manchester's: the Sheffield Supertram and the Midland Metro.
Debate over fixed route systems
To some, Britain's hesitancy is well-founded. Prof Peter Hall, director of
the Institute of Urban and Regional Development at the University of
California, Berkeley, is one of a number of planners who have expressed
reservations over light rail.
Too often, Prof Hall argues, trams take people where they do not want to go.
Their fixed, radial routes are ill-suited to increasing demand for
suburb-to-suburb journeys. Britain's planners and local councillors, he
says, should visit the much more flexible system in Essen, Germany, where
buses roam freely around the suburbs, then enter a fixed guideway giving
passengers an express ride into the city centre.
Set against that background, the Manchester Metrolink is a testbed for light
rail systems in Britain.
If it proves popular with passengers, reduces congestion and operates
without the need of crippling subsidies, it could soften the government's
resistance to a plethora of look-alike schemes.
If it fails to achieve those objectives - and the possibility cannot be
ruled out - the tram revolution, in Britain at least, could end as suddenly
as it started.

FT  06 APR 92 / Justinian: Promise with sting in its tail

<TEXT>
When all the electoral dust has settled, the new UK administration will set
about framing its legislative programme and making ministerial decisions. So
what happens to all those proposals and promises in the election manifesto,
which may have helped the party to win?
The question is not without legal significance. A decade ago, the judges had
something to say about the legal status of election manifestos when the now
defunct Greater London Council sought to implement an election promise by
the Greater London Labour party to introduce a 'fares fair' scheme for
London Transport. Bromley Borough Council successfully challenged the
implementation of the proposal for a 25 per cent overall reduction in fares
because it was motivated solely by the belief that the majority party on the
council was bound to implement a pre-election promise.
The judges held that, while an election manifesto may, and often does,
contain firm and unequivocal proposals, which the electorate might
reasonably expect to be fulfilled, there can be no question that the authors
of the proposals bind themselves irrevocably to honour the pledge. It is
accepted by the law that a proposal may turn out to be unworkable or
impossible of attainment.
Indeed some of the judicial pronouncements in the fares fair case indicated
that the moral obligation to fulfil an electoral promise was even less
compelling. When the party making the proposal gets into the power, the
judges said, it should positively consider afresh any proposal or promise
without feeling obliged to honour it or being committed to it. If that is
the right approach, it reduces election manifestos to little more than
present good intentions to induce the support of voters without involv
Whatever the law's pronouncements on proper regard for election promises,
political parties are likely to attach greater or less importance to their
rivals' political commitments. Political advisers will doubtless keep a keen
watch on how much or how little is translated from manifesto to legislative
or executive action. Other commentators with specialist interests will want
either to remind the politicians of their commitment to a particular
proposal or to seek to persuade them of the impropriety or undesirability of
it.
If the Labour party becomes Her Majesty's government on April 10, there is
one proposal in its manifesto that is already worrying a body of informed,
non-partisan opinion, concerning the future protection of the rights and
interests of children. The Labour party's manifesto promises to establish
'an independent children's commissioner and a children's minister'. The
sting in the proposals' tail is that the minister will be 'within the Home
Office to co-ordinate policies for children across departments'.
Those who have been urging the establishment of a children's rights
commissioner to promote, among other things, compliance with the UN
convention on the rights of the child, adopted by the General Assembly in
November 1989, are mystified by the proposal to put such a minister for
children's rights in the Home Office. It had been widely assumed that the
appropriate ministry would be the Department of Health. To assign the task
of child welfare to the Home Office would be to put the clock back two
decades and convey the wrong message.
At the time that the Labour administration passed the Children and Young
Persons Act in 1969, it took the imaginative step of transferring the
children's department from the Home Office, the department primarily
concerned with law and order, to the department responsible for the health
and care of children. It was a step welcomed both within and outside the
government.
When the House of Commons Social Services Committee in 1984 recommended that
the Department of Health and Social Security should establish a working
party to review childcare law, the government speedily accepted the
suggestion.
The responsibility for the review and the legislation rested with the
Department of Health, which co-ordinated work with other government
departments. The result was the Children Act 1989, which came into force
last October.
Throughout the extensive consultative process and detailed parliamentary
examination of the legislation the Department of Health was the ministry
that promoted the cause of child welfare. It, and not the Home Office, was
the prime agent of law reform.
Any change in ministerial responsibility now would be seen as detracting
from the real advances made in persuading politicians to take children's
rights and interests more seriously.

The most important date in the economic calendar for President George Bush
is arguably July 30. On that red letter day, the Commerce Department
releases its first estimate of gross domestic product in the second quarter.
If the growth rate is 3 per cent or more, Mr Bush will be able to claim an
economic renaissance when he addresses the party faithful at the Republican
convention in August. The Bush presidential campaign could then acquire an
unstoppable momentum.
Several forecasters believe this nightmare for the Democrats is rapidly
becoming a sure bet. Growth will be depressed in the current quarter by
corporate destocking. But industrial production should be growing at an
annual rate of 5-6 per cent within a few months, says Mr Roger Brinner,
chief economist at DRI-McGraw Hill, the forecasting group. He thinks that
will put downward pressure on the politically sensitive unemployment rate.
His economic model of voter behaviour suggests Mr Bush will win 52-53 per
cent of the vote in November - a comfortable victory.
A surge in optimism about the economy has been spurred mainly by a
surprisingly strong rise in consumption spending since Christmas and a
recovery of confidence in the residential housing market, which has
benefited from the Federal Reserve's cheap money policy. Even if retail
sales dip in March, strong gains since the new year point to consumption
growth at an annual rate of 5 per cent or more in the first quarter. Reports
hinting at a broader-based recovery include a sharp rise in the official
indices of leading and coincident indicators and a surge in the Purchasing
Managers' Index, usually a reliable guide to the outlook for the
manufacturing sector.
Many economists, however, are viewing the figures with a jaundiced eye. Last
week, 100 leading academic economists - led by Nobel laureates Mr Robert
Solow of MIT and Mr James Tobin of Yale - sent an open letter to Mr Bush
pleading for urgent action to stimulate the economy. Their main
recommendation is that federal government borrow an extra Dollars 50bn
(about 1 per cent of GDP) to finance higher investment spending by states
and local governments. The group also advocates further interest rate cuts
and tax incentives for capital formation.
Mr Michael Boskin, the White House chief economist, swiftly rejected the
plea for additional borrowing. Speaking in Washington, however, he was only
fractionally more optimistic about the economy than the 100 critics. He
welcomed the recovery of retail sales and claimed the economy's improvement
was set to continue. But he refused to declare the recession over. His
reticence was partly politically motivated: nothing could be more damaging
for the Bush administration than to raise economic hopes a second time, only
to have to concede that the recovery is again a mirage.
Judging from the disappointing March employment report, Mr Boskin was wise
to play down expectations. Non-farm employment rose 19,000, less than half
the increase Wall Street expected and a derisory gain in an economy with
nearly 109m non-agricultural jobs. The Labour Department also revised down
February's figures to show an increase of only 107,000 compared with 164,000
previously. The unemployment rate was unchanged at 7.3 per cent, a six-year
high. The jobs data admittedly lag the cycle: companies respond to higher
demand first by drawing down inventories and then by increasing overtime.
They take on permanent workers only when a sustained rise in production is
expected.
Even allowing for lags, however, the employment figures are unusually
discouraging. There were no more jobs in March than in May of last year,
despite three quarters of slow GDP growth. In a normal recovery, the monthly
increase in employment would now be running at about 300,000. The poor jobs
outlook suggests consumer confidence will rise only gradually and raises
doubts about the sustainability of the recovery in retail spending, which
partly reflected a decline in savings from already depressed levels.
There are other mildly worrying signs. The surge in monetary growth at the
beginning of the year has already tailed off with M2, the targeted measure
of broad money, now growing at an annual rate of only 3 per cent, just above
the bottom of its target range. The deteriorating outlook for Japan and
parts of Europe may also sharply reduce the growth of US exports, a crucial
prop in recent quarters.
The important question is not whether a recovery of sorts is under way but
whether the economy is yet capable of breaking out of its 1990s prison of
sluggish growth. Remarkably, the economy has not grown at an annual rate of
more than 1.9 per cent in any quarter since Mr Bush assumed power early in
1989.
Mr Paul Mastroiddi, US economist at J P Morgan, the New York bank, argues
that most analysts are trying to make recent economic data fit a traditional
cyclical pattern. The dip associated with the Gulf war was one side of a
'V'; economists thus keep hoping that a serious recovery will eventually
kick in. This may happen. It may even happen in time for the Republican
convention. But it is equally possible that the legacy of the 1980s - high
personal and corporate debts, huge public sector deficits and low savings
rates - will keep the economy sluggish for several more quarters.

FT  06 APR 92 / Monday Interview: Making an art of controversy - Jack Lang,
France's minister of education, culture and communications, talks to Alice
Rawsthorn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If a French conservative were asked to compile a hit-list of the gauche
caviar, the sybaritic socialists with a penchant for designer suits and
conceptual art, the name of Mr Jack Lang, France's minister of education,
culture and communications, would almost certainly be at the top.
'They hate me. They detest me,' he says, with more than a hint of smugness.
'To them I am the devil, the incarnation of immorality, a force for evil.'
Mr Lang, who is 52, can afford to be smug. As arts minister, he has become
so popular - two out of three French people admire him, according to the
opinion polls - that his name was cited in the past fortnight as a candidate
to succeed Mrs Edith Cresson as prime minister.
After days of uncertainty, President Francois Mitterrand last Thursday chose
Mr Pierre Beregovoy, his stolid finance minister. 'Bere' was a safer choice,
but the minister of culture would have been more charismatic. As a
consolation prize, Mr Lang was given education to add to his old arts
portfolio.
It is astonishing that Mr Lang's name should have been mentioned at all as
potential prime minister. The arts ministry is not generally seen as a
springboard to higher things in politics in France or elsewhere.
However, he has a close relationship with President Mitterrand, and has
emerged at the forefront of French politics through the force of his
personality. He worked his way up from the grassroots of the Socialist party
after starting his career as a law professor, who made his name in the arts
by founding the International Theatre Festival at Nancy in the 1960s.
He has never been far from the headlines or from controversy during his time
at the culture ministry. There was uproar when Mr Lang and his colleagues
fired the conductor, Mr Daniel Barenboim, from the Paris Opera. There was
another row last year when, after the sculpture at the Louvre subway station
had been defaced by graffiti, Mr Lang announced that he was inaugurating an
exhibition of graffiti art. Most recently he has been pilloried in the
French press for pinning the Order of Arts and Letters on the chunky chest
of Mr Sylvester Stallone, the Hollywood movie star better known for brawn
than brain. One columnist said the Croix de Guerre, a military medal, might
have been more appropriate.
The French press relishes the rumpus over his adventures and misadventures,
but so does Mr Lang. 'Where there is hostility there is debate,' he says,
with a shrug of the shoulders and an elaborate lift of the eyebrows. 'At
least it means people are talking about the arts.'
Although he made no secret of his hopes of becoming prime minister, at one
point pleading for the job on French television, it is impossible to imagine
him enjoying anything as much as his present post. His energy is
unquestionable. Night after night he sweeps into exhibition openings
accompanied by camera crews. His present projects include the renovation of
the 18th-century Palais Royal Gardens, the celebration of the centenary of
the death of Rimbaud, the French poet, and the construction of the new
national library, the tres grande bibliotheque.
Since last May, when he became government spokesman, he has been even more
visible than before - preening for the paparazzi in his Thierry Mugler suits
outside the National Assembly as he rattles off the official line on the
never-ending Gatt negotiations or the socialists' latest diplomatic debacle.
The best illustration of his influence is the rise in the proportion of the
national budget allocated to the arts. It has increased from 0.46 per cent
10 years ago to 0.98 per cent, or FFr12.98bn (Pounds 1.3bn), this year. This
makes France the highest spender on the arts among leading EC countries. The
UK, for example, spends just 0.7 per cent. Mr Lang's critics, however, claim
that the increased proportion of the government budget going to the arts
would be better spent on schools and hospitals.
Mr Lang has achieved his funding increase with a policy that combines
elements of 1950s cultural dirigisme, such as government subsidy, with
modern market forces. He believes that governments should support artists,
film makers, musicians and writers so they do not have to depend entirely on
the private sector - that is, the giant Hollywood entertainment groups. 'I'm
not against all the Hollywood multinationals,' he says. 'But I am against
certain groups that impose uniformity. So much of their work is bad. It's
bland, it's vulgar, it's boring.'
The state's role, he argues, is not to intervene directly in the arts as
governments tried to do in the 1950s. Instead, he says, it should create a
climate in which artists can work. 'Our role is to provide the best possible
environment for artists to work in. We should help to alleviate the
pressures on them and then leave them to choose their own direction.'
Although he favours government grants, Mr Lang differs from his predecessors
in that the multinationals - he recognises the role of the private sector.
He cites the US tradition of corporate sponsorship as an important
influence, as well as the Arts Council of 1950s Britain and the great
Mexican museums. 'The idea that the arts should have nothing to do with the
market is an anachronism. In fact it's worse.' His lips curl ready for a
really big insult: 'It's petit bourgeois.'
His strategy has succeeded in some sectors. The French film industry has
flourished. 'If we hadn't developed a national policy for the cinema, our
film industry would have died, crushed by Hollywood as it has been in other
countries.'
Architecture is another success. The monumental modern buildings conceived
by President Mitterrand and Mr Lang to commemorate the bicentenary of the
French Revolution in 1989, such as the glass pyramid in the Louvre museum
and the great arch at La Defense, are regarded as an international model for
public sector building policy. The UK's Labour party has included many of
the ideas in its arts manifesto.
However, some of Mr Lang's new schemes still stir up a fuss. The latest
furore is over the tres grande bibliotheque, with its glass storage towers.
The original design, say some critics, was ill-conceived: sunlight would
have streamed through the glass scorching France's academic treasures.
'Nonsense,' groans the minister. 'Why won't people listen to the experts?'
Nevertheless, he has been forced to modify the design, making the towers
slightly smaller and storing some books underground.
His critics also point to the opening of the Opera Bastille in Paris, which
was intended to herald a new era of populist opera with cheap seats. The new
opera house operates under the same trade union constraints as the old Opera
de Paris and has been dogged by high ticket prices and intermittent strikes.
The plight of French television, which comes under his communications
portfolio, is even worse. In the early 1980s the Socialists implemented a TV
deregulation drive intended to bring private capital into the old state
system to launch new channels. Instead French viewers are subjected to
apparently endless light entertainment 'spectacles' featuring ageing 'stars'
such as singer Johnny Hallyday. The system is dominated by one channel, TF1,
which has almost half the audience and more than half of all advertising
revenue. Other stations are struggling. The worst case of all is La Cinq,
which went off air on Friday after failing to attract enough viewers or
advertising.
Even Mr Lang appears daunted by the difficulties of French television. 'It
isn't perfect,' he admits. 'But what can we do?' It is a testimony to his
popularity that he has emerged unscathed from La Cinq's collapse.
The length of his tenure at the culture ministry, however, will be
determined not by his own policies, but by Mr Beregovoy's attempts to
salvage the Socialists' electoral chances before next year's general
elections.
Perhaps the biggest test of his achievement will be whether France's present
enthusiasm for the arts - the crowded art galleries, the lively debates on
architecture and the bulging corporate sponsorship budgets - can survive his
departure. 'Will it last?' he asks. 'I don't know. We'll have to wait and
see.'

FT  06 APR 92 / Foreign Exchanges and Money Markets: Tense week for Pounds
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THIS WILL be a tense week for sterling if last week's wobbles were an
indication of what is in store.
Rumours of a sterling crisis began to circulate wildly towards the end of
last week on newspaper stories that Middle East countries were dumping
sterling.
Earlier in the week a string of opinion polls giving Labour a decisive lead
had failed to upset the UK currency.
Dealers said much of sterling's early strength could be attributed to the
commitment of the three main parties to maintaining the pound's current
value within the ERM and the widening of inter-bank interest rate
differentials between the pound and the D-Mark.
As for nervous Middle East investors alleged to be selling sterling, many
analysts poured scorn on the story. Mr Peter Luxton, senior economist at
Barclays, said Middle East dealers were unlikely to act alone, but would
wait for the reaction of domestic investors after the election before taking
a decision on sterling.
The rumours, along with worries over the next set of opinion polls and a
strengthening of the D-Mark within the ERM, meant that sterling ended the
week considerably lower. It closed on Friday night at DM2.8350.
However, this weakened rate still leaves it some 6 pfennigs above its
effective floor within the ERM. Indeed, many analysts are beginning to
question the widely accepted belief that sterling will fall sharply if the
Labour party wins power either outright or in a hung parliament.
One US bank analyst said he thought the market had a great deal of respect
for the strength of the EMS system, with huge scope for sterling profits on
the upside and little but danger on the downside.

FT  06 APR 92 / Syndicated Loans: Local authorities turn to commercial banks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UK LOCAL authorities are not exactly flavour of the month with the banking
community.
Since the swaps fiasco - when the House of Lords ruled that authorities were
acting outside their legal powers in entering swap agreements, and were not
obliged to meet their losses - many foreign banks will no longer do business
with them, leading to wider lending margins for the banks.
There has been something of a renaissance of commercial lending to local
authorities recently. One reason has been the growing number of out-of-court
settlements between banks and authorities over swap agreements.
A second reason is the growing dependence of authorities on commercial
finance. For most of the past decade, the Public Works Loans Board - a
central government-funded agency - has grown in importance as a provider of
finance to authorities. Ten years ago, it had lent exactly a third of total
outstanding long-term debt owed by the authorities. That proportion shot up
during the 1980s, reaching an estimated 79 per cent of the Pounds 61bn
long-term debt at the end of March 1991.
During that period, commercial lenders reduced their exposure from Pounds
28bn to around Pounds 13bn. The main reason for this was the preferential
terms offered by the PWLB. With central government finances in a strong
position, leading to a net repayment of public sector debt, it made sense to
fund local authority borrowing centrally.
The sharp reversal into deficit, and the hefty government borrowing now
projected has changed that picture. The PWLB has been making itself less
attractive as a source of finance. Its interest rates are close to those on
commercial lending and it is likely to become more a lender of last resort
to authorities, rather than the main source of finance.
There could also be political reasons for such a step: PWLB lending shows up
in the official public sector borrowing requirement. External borrowing by
authorities may not, if it is for revenue rather than capital purposes. With
the PWLB making new advances of Pounds 3.6bn in 1990/91, and nearly Pounds
8bn the year before, the sums are insignificant.
Much of the syndicated commercial lending made to local authorities during
the mid-1980s is coming up for renewal over the next three years. These
arrangements are not strictly classified as 'borrowing', since they were
structured to get around centrally-set borrowing limits. Known as 'deferred
purchase' arrangements, these off-balance sheet deals became a cause celebre
in the 1980s, as authorities entered sale and leaseback arrangements on
assets.
Most deferred purchase schemes look set to be renewed in their current form,
if only because to restructure them would bring them into the borrowing net,
reducing the capacity of authorities to borrow elsewhere.
All of this points to a growing dependence on commercial banks. Several
bankers comment that short-term borrowing by authorities has picked up
recently, with a healthy two-way business being done through money-brokers.
The costs have risen, though. The margin over Libor on five-year lending to
local authorities is put at around 50 basis points - or half a percentage
point. For the off-balance sheet schemes, the margin is more like 70 basis
points, reflecting the complex structuring involved. That is close to what
many companies pay. The authorities, though, are regarded as sovereign
credits, with a capital weighting to match: banks need to set aside only 0.2
per cent of the capital they would have to provide for a straight corporate
credit. Local authority lending does not come with an explicit guarantee
from central government, but the banks take a charge over the future tax
receipts of the authorities concerned.
Some authorities complain this is a 'penal' rate, set to punish them for the
swaps losses. But if a new commercial market does develop for local
authority finance, that penalty is unlikely to last.

FT  06 APR 92 / International Bonds: Cracks show in fragile consensus over
new issuance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FRAGILE consensus among Eurobond firms on the conduct of new issue
business, which has looked strained for months, last week deteriorated
further.
The cause of disagreement was an Ecu400m 12-year issue by the European
Investment Bank, lead managed by Deutsche Bank Capital Markets under a
pricing and fee structure which many firms deplored. Many leading new issue
houses declined to participate in the transaction.
However, behind the acrimony lies a change in the economics of the market.
The common front among leading firms has been deteriorating since new issue
activity started to boom last year. Big firms have became more adventurous,
hungry for a larger slice of the market and prepared to take risks to match.
The EIB issue was controversial partly because it offered participants,
including the lead manager, only a very slim return for underwriting.
Deutsche Bank underwrote most of the transaction and said it had substantial
lead orders for the bonds. Underwriting risk was very small and remuneration
was correspondingly slight, it argued.
The deal was not the first to offer underwriting fees lower than the norm
established in the dark days of the late 1980s. A striking feature of the
primary Eurobond market this year is an increasing number of 'block trades,'
deals wholly underwritten by a single firm at a reduced rate.
Last week, Abbey National raised Pounds 250m over five years from an issue
wholly underwritten by Barclays de Zoete Wedd. The fees were undisclosed but
were probably well below the established level.
Merrill Lynch was the sole underwriter for a ADollars 150m 15-year deal for
the State Electricity Corporation of Victoria. Again, fees were undisclosed.
The last few issues by the EIB have also been handled as block trades by
firms willing to take on the majority of the underwriting risk for a
marginal return.
Moreover, there is an underlying trend for lead managers to take a larger
proportion of new issues which are, on the surface, sold through a wide
syndicate of firms. Block trades are a natural extension of this.
'The new issue business is no longer about following secondary market trends
and pumping out bonds indiscriminately. Firms need to concentrate on real
investor flows, lining up lead orders for a deal,' commented a new issue
manager.
The EIB and Deutsche Bank also declined to use 'fixed price' syndication
techniques which have been established in the Eurobond market since 1989 and
are widely credited with restoring order and profitability to the primary
market.
Instead, the deal was structured as an 'old style' deal, using syndication
practices which many firms hoped never to see again.
Under an old style deal, underwriters buy the bonds from the issuer at a
discount but are free to sell at any price. The EIB bonds carried an issue
price of 100.66, but were owned by the underwriters at 98.535.
In theory, the underwriters can sell the bonds at any level up to the issue
price, at which point they earn 'full fees' - in this case a handsome 2.125
per cent of the amount raised.
In practice, the bonds usually trade down to the price at which the
underwriters own the deal, as syndicate members compete to off-load paper
into the market. At this level the underwriters earn no fees. The EIB issue
was quoted by the lead manager at a discount equivalent to full fees as soon
as it was launched.
In a 'new style' fixed priced syndication, underwriters buy bonds from the
issuer at a discount as before, but must sell the paper at a level
prescribed by the lead manager during the initial stages of the deal.
There is no pretence that underwriters will earn fees as high as 2.125 per
cent. If all the bonds are sold to investors at the fixed price,
underwriters might expect to earn 0.30 to 0.35 per cent from an issue
similar to the EIB deal.
However, by holding the bonds at a fixed price until the majority of bonds
are in the firm hands of investors, this margin should be secured.
Badly priced issues will still drop in price once they are allowed to find a
'free-market' level. But proponents of the fixed price system argue that it
brings much-needed order and discipline to the primary market, protecting
the return paid to underwriters and, therefore, the long-term health of the
primary market.
Hence Deutsche Bank aroused the ire of its peers not only for underwriting
bonds in return for slender fees, but also for reverting to syndication
techniques which - if copied by other borrowers - many fear would erode the
profitability of all market participants.
If current trends continue, however, such fears will be overtaken by events.
The bigger new issue houses appear to be moving away from syndicated deals
altogether for all but the largest transactions.
Those firms with a capital base large enough to absorb underwriting risk
look increasingly determined to use this 'critical mass' to win new issue
business alone.

FT  06 APR 92 / UK Gilts: Prospect of Labour win hits prices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A WEEK of trepidation looms for people in the government gilt-edged
securities market.
Many gilt specialists reckon a Labour win in Thursday's general election
will cause a run on sterling, higher interest rates and increased public
sector borrowing - all of which would push up bond yields.
As results from opinion polls indicating a Labour lead fed their way into
market thinking, prices for gilts fell last week by up to  3/4 of a point,
continuing the poor run for the securities which started in the week prior
to Budget day on March 10. Since then, 10-year gilt yields have risen by 80
basis points - 0.8 of a percentage point - to about 10 per cent, with a
consequent reduction in prices.
A big fear for the market concerns sterling, which some gilt investors
believe would come under pressure following a Labour victory. Base rates
might then have to rise to defend the currency, an event which would push up
gilt yields along the yield curve but especially at the short end and
depress prices.
Farther in the background, but no less of a problem for the market, is the
size of the public sector borrowing requirement (PSBR). In the Treasury's
latest prediction, this is likely to rise to Pounds 28bn this financial year
and Pounds 32bn in 1993-94, from Pounds 14bn in 1991-92. To fund the PSBR,
the Bank of England will probably have to sell Pounds 2bn to Pounds 3bn
worth of gilts a month over the next year or so, a huge selling programme
that will almost certainly push up yields and depress prices.
While the Treasury's prediction assumes Tory policies, should Labour form
the next government, public-sector borrowing might be forced up still more.
According to Mr Simon Briscoe, an economist at Greenwell Montagu, Labour
policies could add Pounds 15bn to the figure over the next two years,
leading to a further drift downwards in prices.
Mr Briscoe assumes Labour would cancel privatisation sales planned by the
Tories, reducing government revenues by Pounds 7bn over the two years and
pushing up borrowing by the same amount. Further, he thinks Labour's
proposal to let local authorities spend cash obtained from sales of houses
and other assets during the 1980s would add a further Pounds 8bn to the PSBR
during the two-year period.
Assuming a Labour victory or a Labour-led coalition, Mr John Smith, the new
chancellor, would have to introduce a Budget, probably before the end of
May. Ahead of this event, according to Mr Andrew Bell, a strategist at
Barclays de Zoete Wedd, the gilt market would be affected by great
uncertainty while the Bank would have to proceed with its large programme of
gilt sales which has already been interrupted by the election.
That could lead to the Bank attempting to sell up to about Pounds 5bn of
gilts during a time of weak demand for the securities, events which could
depress market conditions.
During last week, such gloomy thoughts preoccupied many gilt traders, with
short-dated gilts bearing the brunt of the decline in prices. The benchmark
10 per cent Treasury bond maturing in 1994 fell by nearly 3/4 point to 98
13/16 , with a rise in yields from 10.2 per cent to 10.55 per cent. Longer
maturing stock was better protected from the price fall; the 9 per cent
Treasury bond maturing in 2008 saw a fall of about  1/2 point, closing on
Friday at 94 1/8 for a yield of 9.7 per cent.
With gilt prices having tumbled so much recently, some believe buying
support will rally as investors pick up what could be perceived as bargain
stocks. Mr David Boardman, head of fixed income at Fleming Investment
Management, a big bond investor, said: 'At the prices we have seen recently,
gilts are beginning to look attractive.'
From the point of view of the Bank, which badly needs to get on with its
funding programme, indications of heightened interest in gilts would be
welcome. The Bank would like to see a return to the position in February in
which, according to the latest funding statistics, it sold to the market a
hefty Pounds 1.6bn worth of gilts, with purchasing from overseas investors
especially strong.

FT  06 APR 92 / German Bonds: Statistics underline investor pessimism
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT IS almost as though the rally had never taken place. Yields on 10-year
bunds were back at over 8.1 per cent on Friday, up sharply since prices
reached their high point for the year in February.
The optimism which followed the Bundesbank's rate rise in late December has
evaporated and investors are talking gloomily about yields being back up to
8.2 per cent again before long. Talk of 7.5 per cent by the middle of the
year is dismissed out of hand.
A series of recent statistics has underscored the pessimism. A fortnight ago
it emerged that M3, the broad measure of money supply, climbed by a
seasonally adjusted annual rate of 8.5 per cent in February, compared with a
target of 3.5 to 5.5 per cent growth for the full year.
Last Thursday, year-on-year inflation for March came out at 4.7 per cent -
and is expected to come in at the same level this month. On Friday it was
announced that industrial production in February climbed by 1.2 per cent on
January - worse than expected in that the market was expecting evidence of a
slowdown.
Although there have been few tangible developments in the wage round in the
past month or so, what settlements there have been have tended to exacerbate
the gloom.
What investors really care about is a cut in interest rates. When they
bought bunds in late December, they had persuaded themselves the rate rise
would induce sense into the wage round, slow the economy and curb inflation
 -all in time for a rate cut by late spring. As recent indicators show,
there is no evidence of a severe slow down in the economy. Mr Norbert
Walter, chief economist and head of research at Deutsche Bank, argued at the
bank's seminar for international investors in Berlin two weeks ago that it
looks unlikely the inverse yield curve will presage a recession, as is
traditionally the case.
Current stagnation is likely to give way to recovery later this year, as
borne out by a poll of 400 big German companies conducted by the
Munich-based IFO economics research institute published last week. The
companies are expecting a pick-up in orders, sales and investments next
year. This optimism appears in stark contrast to this year's daily
announcements of staff lay-offs and falling profits - but it is perhaps the
medium-term view which will determine management's willingness to face down
high wage demands.
Another negative factor is the 1 percentage point increase in the VAT rate
to be introduced at the beginning of next year. This may push up the
headline inflation rate once again, which will in turn influence next year's
wage round.
Against this background, it seems improbable that the Bundesbank will hurry
to cut interest rates when it is clear inflation has peaked for the current
year. Mr Walter predicts a cut in money market rates in June. Others are not
so sanguine and it looks as though the bund market will be in the doldrums
for some months to come.

TRADING volume at the Chicago Bard of Trade and the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange, the world's two largest futures markets, shot up during the first
quarter of this year. The CME's volume surged nearly 30 per cent against the
same period last year and the CBOT's jumped more than 22 per cent, writes
Barbara Durr.
At the CME, trading volume in futures reached 28m contracts, a 28.5 per cent
increase over the first quarter of 1991, and futures-options volume rose to
6.6m, a 35.4 per cent rise over a year ago. Futures trading at the CBOT rose
to 33.6m, up 23.6 per cent over 1991, and futures-options volume rose to
8.3m contracts, a 16.3 per cent expansion.
Contracts at both exchanges have broken trading records in the past three
months. At the CBOT, two, five and 10-year Treasury note futures captured
record volume, while the CME's futures on Eurodollars, and D-Marks set new
highs.

FT  06 APR 92 / International Company News: SAS looks for cupid in Europe's
open skies - The airline's ultimate aim of a full-blown merger ahead of
deregulation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB and PAUL BETTS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Faced with the prospects of deregulation in his domestic market in Sweden
and broader liberalisation in Europe, Mr Jan Carlzon, the chief executive of
Scandinavian Airlines System (SAS), has been scrambling to expand his
airline's ties with other carriers both on the home and wider European
front.
Last week, SAS boosted its stake in Airlines of Britain, the parent company
of British Midland, from 24.9 per cent to 40 per cent for Pounds 25m
(Dollars 42.5m) to cement its relationship with the UK carrier which had
recently been approached by other international carriers interested in a
stake.
In February, it agreed to buy 51 per cent control of Linjeflyg, the Swedish
domestic carrier. The acquisition, now being reviewed by Sweden's office of
fair trading, is designed to consolidate the airline's position in its home
market in anticipation of Swedish airline deregulation.
After an unsuccessful attempt to link with Sabena of Belgium five years ago,
SAS has since formed a commercial partnership with Swissair and Austrian
Airlines called the European Quality Alliance (EQA).
For Mr Carlzon, the ultimate target continues to be a full-blown merger with
another European airline to enable SAS to establish a stronger position in
the European market.
Based on the geographical fringes of Europe, SAS is handicapped by its
smaller size compared not only with the large US carriers now aggressively
expanding into Europe but also with the big European carriers like British
Airways, Air France or Lufthansa.
But for all the recent talk of cross-border airline mergers in Europe, these
have so far been elusive, although the European Commission's third package
of air transport liberalisation measures is likely to accelerate the process
next year.
In the absence of a full merger, Mr Carlzon says the second best solution is
to get as close as possible to this goal. 'Our aim is to have as close a
co-operation as if we were merged, knowing that we cannot merge,' he said in
an interview with the Financial Times.
As the sunlight streams into his spacious office in SAS's modern steel and
glass headquarters building in Stockholm, he smiles and adds: 'If you cannot
get the girl you want you have to take the second best, otherwise you will
be left all alone.'
To survive when the European airline market is liberalised next year, SAS,
he says, must broaden its market base and establish its presence in the main
destinations of Europe, at the same time as improving efficiency and its
financial situation.
'If we sit in Scandinavia, we will have too small a market to be
competitive,' he explains. 'None of the European airlines have access to
more than one major hub in their home market, but by combining SAS with
British Midland and EQA, we will have an annual passenger volume of 35.2m
passengers'.
This, he claims, makes his partnership the largest in Europe, placing it
ahead of the Air France group with 33.4m passengers a year.
The three EQA partners have hubs in Copenhagen (SAS), Zurich (Swissair) and
Vienna (Austrian Airlines). British Midland provides the alliance with an
important presence at London's Heathrow since the UK carrier has the second
largest number of take-off and landing 'slots' at Heathrow after BA.
With British Midland, SAS hopes to enter the UK market under cover. But it
is also a way of fending off a growing challenge from smaller independent
Scandinavian carriers seeking to develop a rival hub at London's Gatwick
airport to compete against SAS.
Three Scandinavian carriers, Transwede Airways, Norway Airways and Sterling,
have joined forces under the umbrella of the NRT Nordisk travel group to
take advantage of Swedish airline deregulation and develop feeder services
from Scandinavia to Gatwick and other European airports to connect with the
international networks of larger airlines. Maersk Air, the Danish
independent carrier, is also building up a hub at Gatwick.
These smaller carriers believe they can compete strongly against SAS because
their costs are about 30 per cent lower than those of the Scandinavian flag
carrier.
This is putting additional pressure on SAS to reduce its costs. The airline,
which cut 2,700 jobs last year and plans to shed a further 3,500 this year,
is seeking to improve productivity by 20 per cent in 1991-92.
This has not been easy. It started negotiating 38 separate collective
agreements with unions in Scandinavia 15 months ago. So far, it has reached
agreement with 35 without lowering any of the salaries. The remaining three
are the pilots' unions where SAS wants the pilots to increase the time they
actually fly during their working day.
SAS risks seeing its virtual monopoly of the Scandinavian market eroded by
domestic deregulation at a time when it is still struggling to recover from
the general airline industry slump as well as strengthening its European
network through partnerships and alliances.
The airline was extremely concerned by the unsuccessful merger talks between
BA and KLM Royal Dutch Airlines. A BA-KLM combination would have posed a
significant competitive threat to SAS which, in turn, attempted to interest
KLM in joining its EQA partnership with Swissair and Austrian Airlines.
Mr Carlzon has not only had to cope with recession but has also had to alter
radically his earlier ambitious strategy of turning SAS into a global travel
and hotel group. The group, which made a pre-tax loss of SKr1.22bn (Dollars
206m) last year compared with a loss of SKr736m in 1990, is now refocusing
on its core airline activities.
Apart from the fall in air traffic, the group was hit by heavy losses from
its unsuccessful attempt to expand its hotel activities: it bought a 40 per
cent stake in Inter-Continental in 1989 from Saison, the Japanese retail and
leisure group which is the hotel chain's controlling shareholder, but was
forced to sell the stake back last month (March).
The U-turn was seen as a clear admission of failure, and Mr Carlzon - who
was strongly criticised for his decision to embark on this loss-making
project - says that he regrets the ill-starred venture.
In future, SAS may sell some of the other hotels it owns, but Mr Carlzon
says he does not intend putting them up for sale until there is some sign of
recovery in the troubled property market.

FT  06 APR 92 / International Company News: Black plans more TV investment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR CONRAD Black, chairman of the Daily Telegraph group, is planning to make
further investments in television.
The newspaper group was a member of the losing Daybreak consortium for the
commercial breakfast television franchise last year, but has a 5 per cent
stake in Carlton Television which won the London weekday franchise.
In the Daily Telegraph's annual report, Mr Black said: 'The possibility of
further investment in television will be pursued.'
The Daily Telegraph has had talks with a number of potential bidders for
Channel 5, the new television channel capable of reaching three quarters of
the UK population. These include Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the Italian
businessman.
The invitation to bid and the precise terms of the Channel 5 licence will be
published by the Independent Television Commission later this month.
Mr Black has had talks with Mr Moses Znaimer, the Canadian broadcaster who
set up City TV in Toronto. Mr Znaimer is to be chief executive of Five TV, a
bidder for the Channel 5 franchise planning to specialise in local news,
films and music.
However there is still a considerable degree of scepticism in the Daily
Telegraph about whether Channel 5 is a viable financial prospect because the
winner will have to pay for the retuning of millions of video recorders and
satellite receivers. At present they use the frequencies that Channel 5 will
broadcast on and the new channel will cause considerable interference.

Without the burden of exceptional charges in 1991, Atlas Converting
Equipment has increased its pre-tax profit from Pounds 5.51m to Pounds
6.67m.
Turnover rose to Pounds 48.5m (Pounds 38.3m). Margins were maintained on
Atlas machines, which accounted for 62 per cent of sales, but reduced
profits came from Titan units principally because of the weak US dollar in
the first half, and from General Vacuum Equipment where prices were reduced
to maintain volume.
Results also included first full figures from Atlas Hurley Moate, where
profit was 'not at an acceptable level.'
There was a small interest charge of Pounds 70,000 this year, against income
of Pounds 631,000. Earnings per share were 55p (45p) and the final dividend
is 14p for a total of 21p (19.5p).

FT  06 APR 92 / International Company News: Norwich Union losses on general
insurance rise 81%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER

<TEXT>
NORWICH UNION, the mutually-owned insurer, suffered an 81 per cent increase
in pre-tax losses on its general insurance business in 1991, from Pounds
147.7m to Pounds 267.7m.
Worldwide underwriting losses rose to Pounds 297.7m (Pounds 175.7m), with
most of the damage concentrated in the UK which was hit by rising theft and
other recession related claims. UK underwriting losses rose by 65 per cent
to Pounds 276.7m (Pounds 167.6m).
The life business fared better, however. Total premiums expanded 33 per cent
to Pounds 3.3bn (Pounds 2.49bn). Worldwide income from new single premiums
rose 43 per cent to Pounds 2bn (Pounds 1.4bn), fuelled by strong sales of
single premium with-profits contracts in the UK. But growth in new annual
business was sluggish with premiums up only 1.5 per cent to Pounds 238.4m
(Pounds 234.8m).
Mr Allen Bridgewater, group chief executive, said: 'It is absolutely
essential to restore our general insurance to profitability as soon as
possible.'
Last year the group announced sharp increases in premiums - with rates
rising by up to 80 per cent for high performance cars, for example. The
group is the country's biggest insurer of motor cyclists but last year
announced that it would refuse to insure some categories of rider.
Despite the loss, the group still transferred Pounds 21m from its general
insurance account to its life fund. Although this was less than the Pounds
29m paid in 1990, transfers over the last three years have still equalled
the dividend income which would have been received if the capital backing
general insurance had been invested in a range of ordinary shares, the group
pointed out.
General insurance represents about one-third of premium income and an
investment of less than 5 per cent of life insurance assets.
With-profit bonus rates levels were set at lower levels
The group is investing greater amounts of its assets into fixed interest
investments. It expects 'equities to out-perform fixed interest assets by a
far smaller margin in future, particularly over the next two years.'

FT  06 APR 92 / International Company News: Johnston Group slides into
losses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JOHNSTON GROUP, the specialist civil and mechanical engineer, has slid into
losses, another casualty of over-ambitious 1980s investment in the property
sector.
Pre-tax profits collapsed from Pounds 5.86m to losses of Pounds 1.09m, after
a Pounds 4.34m exceptional charge covering the write-down on three property
developments. Sales were 5 per cent lower at Pounds 119.9m.
Losses per share were 14.18p (earnings 30.43p) but the company is to pay a
reduced final dividend of 4.5p, giving a total for the year of 9p, down 31
per cent on the previous 13p.
Mr Brian Deller, finance director, said Johnston had now bitten the bullet
with the 25 per cent write-down in property values. 'Property development
served us well in the 1980s until 1988,' he said. 'We thought it had a great
deal of potential but we stayed in too long.'
The property diversion blighted a result which was otherwise relatively
sound, given the depth of the recession in its markets.
Engineering saw a profit of Pounds 1.38m turn into losses of Pounds 1.91m on
sales that fell 20 per cent. The figure included the cost of redundancies
and consolidating a number of companies in single operating units.
Construction and contracting, on the other hand, benefitted from development
work done for the water companies. The division increased profits from
Pounds 1.66m to Pounds 2.2m. Construction materials fell slightly to profits
of Pounds 4.38m.

FT  06 APR 92 / International Company News: Downsize to exist - expand later
/ Scottish Heritable's preparation for turnround
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FROM CARPET making in India to Scottish tenement flats, from lime quarries
in Texas to firework manufacture in Yorkshire; the interests of York-based
mini-conglomerate Scottish Heritable Trust have been nothing if not varied.
In the 1980s, when the banks were keen to lend and expansion was the
fashion, SHT saw its wide spread of companies as a safeguard against a
downturn in any sector.
But the 1990 results, which showed a loss of Pounds 15.9m and gearing of
more than 300 per cent on net debt of Pounds 66.4m, brought an urgent
reappraisal and management changes.
The early fruit of the new approach was seen last week in the 1991
preliminary results, which showed a pre-tax loss down to Pounds 792,000, net
borrowings reduced to Pounds 41m and gearing down to 270 per cent.
Now the new management are pushing against a tight timescale to get
borrowings under Pounds 10m by the year end, to cut gearing to 100 per cent
or less, and to inject a greater logic into the group's activities, as a
basis for future profitable growth.
'We have to downsize SHT and then start again,' says Mr Brian Shoosmith, an
ex-Hawker Siddeley executive who joined SHT as managing director last
August.
Synergy and debt reduction are at the nub of SHT's divestment philosophy.
At face value, it might seem odd that SHT is contemplating the sale of
Standard Fireworks, the dominant UK manufacturer in its sector, and the
group's main profit earner. Last year Standard made Pounds 3.3m before tax
and interest on turnover of Pounds 18.7m. But its disposal - discussions on
a management buy out are at an advanced stage - would help to substantially
reduce borrowings. And, observes Mr Shoosmith: 'How do you find synergistic
business with a fireworks company?'
The remaining company in the manufacturing division, loss-making
Birmingham-based hospital bed manufacturer Hoskins, was sold in February for
Pounds 1.3m to specialist healthcare company Securetrend.
The further flung extremities of the group's empire are also under review.
In India, E Hill and Co, in which SHT has a 74 per cent stake, is being sold
to its minority partner. 'It's just the problem of trying to run an Indian
carpet making business from York,' says Mr Shoosmith wryly.
A decline in oriental carpet sales in 1991 contributed to the group's drop
in turnover from Pounds 116m to Pounds 95.5m. The future policy on oriental
carpet importing, wholesaling and washing subsidiaries in the UK, France and
the US is under consideration.
Just over half the Pounds 25.4m reduction in net borrowings resulted from
the release from a USDollars 28m guarantee of the debt of one of the US
associates, Scottish Heritable Inc. SHT does not have a controlling interest
in that company or in its four associated US lime quarries, and hopes
eventually to sell its stakes.
Its two wholly owned American housebuilding companies, Haven Homes in
Pennsylvania and Fox Ridge Homes in Tennessee, both made good profits and
the group intends to retain them. It would like, however, to free itself of
its minority stake in North American Housing Corporation.
The other division, property, consists of St James Development Trust, which
has a mixed portfolio of land around Britain and some partially developed
sites, and Cromdale Holdings, which owns hundreds of tenanted tenement flats
in and around Glasgow.
Disposal of part of the St James portfolio is imminent. Once the property
market improves, SHT hopes to get out of development completely, but expects
to retain Cromdale Holdings.
Mr Shoosmith and SHT's new finance director, Mr Stuart Macdonald, who joined
in October, are keenly aware that under their standstill agreement with the
banks the amount available drops from Pounds 31.5m now to Pounds 6m by
December: the US facility also falls from Dollars 33.5m now to Dollars 20m
in October.
In the longer term, a much smaller SHT will have to decide on its expansion
strategy. But there are more pressing considerations.
'Number one is existence, making sure we do have a future' says Mr
Shoosmith. 'This is the year of the turn around.'

FT  06 APR 92 / International Company News: Sitac and TI India buy Muddy Fox
out of receivership
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MUDDY FOX, the UK maker of mountain bikes which is privately-owned, has been
bought out of administrative receivership by Sitac, a UK-based engineering
and property group, and TI Cycles of India for an undisclosed but
substantial amount.
The sale comes less than a month after Touche Ross, the accountants, were
appointed as administrative receivers following unspecified financial
difficulties at the Wembley-based company.
Yesterday Mr Nick Lyle, partner at Touche Ross and administrative receiver
responsible for the sale, said: 'Muddy Fox is a classic example of how a
basically sound company can be preserved despite receivership.'
Sitac and TI Cycles, which is 24 per cent owned by TI Group, the specialist
UK engineering company, are buying the assets, trademark and intellectual
property of Muddy Fox for what is understood to be 'close to a seven-figure
sum.' Turnover last year was Pounds 8.5m.
TI Cycles is one of India's biggest bicycle and engineering groups, but
Muddy Fox bikes will continue to be developed and designed in the UK and
produced at the company's existing manufacturing sources in the Far East.
The administrative receivership of Muddy Fox prompted around 200 inquiries
from potential purchasers, and the UK/Indian combination won through from a
shortlist of six.
The new owners said they were looking forward to supplying and supporting
the existing network of UK and European customers.
They are also formulating plans for developing the business and are looking
to appoint distributors in the UK and Germany, and to develop opportunities
in the UK, Europe, North America and Australasia.

FT  06 APR 92 / BAe poised for deal with Saudis
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WHITE, Defence Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH AEROSPACE expects a contract within weeks to supply additional
Tornado bombers to Saudi Arabia, following a Pounds 1.5bn cash injection
into the Saudi programme for purchasing arms and defence services from the
UK.
Mr John Major, UK prime minister, said at the weekend Saudi Arabia's King
Fahd had decided to make the extra funding available. 'This is the event
that we've been waiting for,' said a spokesman for BAe, prime contractor for
UK supplies under the Al-Yamamah arms agreement between the two countries.
The money is expected to facilitate the signing of contracts worth several
billion pounds under the second phase of the agreement. The framework for
this second phase was agreed almost four years ago. But, except for three
Vosper Thornycroft minehunting vessels, no significant new equipment orders
have been placed since then.
Other planned supplies include 48 Tornado jets, about 60 BAe Hawk light
fighters, 88 Black Hawk armed helicopters from Westland under licence from
Sikorsky of the US, three minehunters, and infrastructure projects including
an air base on the edge of Saudi Arabia's Empty Quarter.
Saudi Arabia earmarks 500,000 barrels of oil a day for its UK defence
supplies. This is sold by oil companies and the revenue paid into a Saudi
account in London, from which the British Ministry of Defence draws down
money to pay BAe.
Although this brings in about Pounds 2bn a year, the funds have been taken
up by the completion of first-phase deliveries, training and support
services and construction work on air bases.
Mr Major said discussions were going on 'regarding all kinds of weapon
systems' required by Saudi Arabia. Al-Yamamah supplies had topped Pounds
10bn so far.
Saudi Arabia injected almost Pounds 2bn extra cash into the deal in late
1989, when it also raised by 25 per cent the amount of oil set aside for
this purpose.
The additional Tornados, made in collaboration with Germany and Italy, are
believed to be at the top of the Saudi 'wish list'. A new contract would
provide crucial interim work for BAe's Warton factory in Lancashire, where
final assembly of Tornados for the RAF ends this summer. Production of the
European Fighter Aircraft is unlikely before 1994.

FT  06 APR 92 / Economics Notebook: Finland keeps a wary eye on the markka
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It will not be a normal Monday morning in Helsinki today. For when Finland's
financial markets open up for trade, politicians and bankers alike will be
keenly watching the currency and interest rate movements to see whether the
emergency economic package announced this weekend will be sufficient to
avert a forced devaluation of the Finnish markka and restore confidence in
the markets and the centre-right government.
Financial markets are notoriously sensitive to political and economic
instability, and Finland is no exception.
When Mr Esko Aho, the prime minister, said recently he thought the Bank of
Finland was partly to blame for mistakes in monetary policy and for the
problems which have hit the Finnish banking sector, the comments did not go
down well at the central bank. Mr Rolf Kullberg, the governor, appeared on
television and made it clear all decisions had taken place with the
co-operation of the government.
The public tiff between the central bank and the government did little to
calm the financial markets, and Mr Kullberg announced late last Thursday
that he would leave the bank on July 1.
The move hit the foreign exchange and fixed income markets when they opened
for trade on Friday. Short-term interest rates shot up, from 12.85 per cent
to 16.76 per cent in the case of one-month Helibor rates.
Estimates of the amount of capital which flooded out of the country on
Friday ranged from FM5bn (Pounds 642m) to FM10bn. By mid-afternoon, some
banks in Finland had halted foreign exchange transactions and were refusing
even to change travellers' cheques following speculation that the Markka
could be devalued for the second time in less than six months. There was
even speculation that the government would be forced to resign.
Both the Bank of Finland and the government responded swiftly - if somewhat
clumsily - to the crisis. The bank, which originally said Ms Sirkka
Hamalainen would take over as governor on July 1, announced at a hastily
called press conference yesterday that it would be better if she took over
immediately.
Meanwhile, the government launched an emergency rescue package, promising
government spending cuts of FM10 bn, mainly in pensions and child and
sickness benefits.
The decision should at least convince Finns and foreigners alike that the
government is committed to cutting its heavy borrowing requirement, although
it cannot solve some of the other problems facing the Finnish economy.
When Mr Aho came to power last April he inherited an economy already in
recession. During 1992, the recession deepened and Finland's GDP declined
6.1 per cent. About half the fall in GDP is attributed to the collapse in
trade with the former Soviet Union, once an important partner for Finland.
However, the economic and social problems faced by the former Soviet Union,
and the ending of bilateral trade between the two countries at the end of
1990 cut Finnish-Soviet trade by about 65 per cent in value in 1991. By the
end of last year, exports to the Soviet Union accounted for less than 5 per
cent of Finland's total exports, compared with 26 per cent in 1985.
Trade with the Soviet Union benefited large and small Finnish companies: the
large capital-intensive industries, for example in ship-building,
engineering and forestry, won large orders, while small and medium-sized
companies benefited as subcontractors.
Now, with many of the republics which once made up the Soviet Union on the
verge of poverty, the prospect of a recovery in trade is unlikely.
Even the 260 or so joint ventures set up by Finnish companies with Soviet
partners are no substitute, according to a recent report by the Bank of
Finland, since many of them are expected to take several years before they
are fully operational.
The problem for Finnish exporters is that other markets have not been able
to take up the slack: the recession in the US and Europe - particularly in
the important UK and Swedish markets - meant demand for Finnish goods from
these areas remained weak.
At home, high interest rates have discouraged many debt-burdened companies
and households from spending. Private consumption fell 5 per cent, and
investment 16 per cent last year.
With weak demand at home and abroad, more than 6,000 companies went bankrupt
last year, nearly double the level in 1990, and a record for Finland.
The collapse of so many businesses hit the banks: they have suffered from
record loan losses and have seen a sharp increase in non-performing loans.
As a result, most banks reported losses in 1991 and the government was
forced to announce measures earlier this year to prop up the banking sector.
Public sector spending accelerated last year, boosted by a rise in
unemployment to 10 per cent, while tax revenue declined, leading to a
deterioration in government finances. The current account deficit reached
FM23.4bn last year, boosted by interest payments on foreign debt.
As Finland's economic problems worsened in 1991, the Bank of Finland came
under pressure to devalue the currency to improve competitiveness. Worries
about wage settlements led to a sharp outflow of currency last autumn, and
eventually forced a devaluation in November, when the external value of the
markka was allowed to fall by 12.3 per cent.
The devaluation prompted two senior central bankers to resign and led Mr
Kullberg to offer his resignation to the Finnish president, who asked him to
stay on.
At the time the government denied there would be a devaluation, which is
why, some cynics point out, the government is struggling to convince the
markets this time there is no chance of another devaluation.
And that is why everyone will wait for this morning's opening.

FT  06 APR 92 / Letter: A confused pay picture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr DAVID PELLY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your leader, 'Labour and the trade unions' (March 31), in seeking to
comment on the political debate on public sector pay, confuses an already
complex picture.
To say that 'average pay in the public sector is now higher than in the
private sector' is misleading on two counts.
First, 'average pay' is a meaningless term in the context of national labour
markets covering a huge variety of occupations including top civil servants,
nurses, teachers, and cleaners. Second, pay in the public sector is not in
any case 'higher than the private sector'. What we have seen this year is
the government implementing review board recommendations for pay increases
for certain groups, including nurses and teachers, that have generally been
higher than the current level of settlements in the private sector.
However, by focusing on the size of settlements for some groups, you ignore
the fact that the level of pay of many public sector workers still seriously
lags that of their private sector counterparts. Civil servants are a case in
point. As a result of conscious government policy to hold down the pay of
civil servants over the last few years their pay has lagged behind. This
will inevitably create problems with recruitment and retention and pressure
to close the gap again.
The 'boom and bust' effects of government policy on public sector pay will
only be avoided through a long-term commitment to a fair system of public
sector pay determination involving independent pay reviews and national
negotiations as appropriate. Public sector pay should not be used as a
mechanism for short-term macroeconomic control.

FT  06 APR 92 / Letter: US could stall opening of shipping markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr MICHAEL EVERARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I hear Ms Margaret S Wigglesworth's message on trade and 'free riders'
(Letters, April 1) loud and clear. It is, however, important for all serious
participants in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade services
negotiations to lead by example.
One US private services sector - shipping - is certainly not a 'steadfast
supporter of the Uruguay Round', neither is it 'largely open for business'.
After strenuous industry lobbying, the US government has listed six
exemption requests covering shipping, including 'any other agreements, laws,
regulations, or policies of the United States . . . which pertain to
maritime transportation and the operation of merchant vessels . . . existing
and future'.
British shipping entirely supports Ms Wigglesworth's call for a General
Agreement on Trade in Services (Gats) which achieves real market access.
This must include both a standstill on new restrictions and the removal of
existing ones. But the American example will enshrine the status quo and
stall the current strong move to open shipping markets that is already
taking place. Shipping is therefore drawn to taking its chances outside the
Gats.

FT  06 APR 92 / Letter: Claim that minimum wage would add 30% to labour
costs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Ms ELIZABETH M MACLEOD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
With reference to the letter from Stephen Machin and others of the London
School of Economics (April 2) we write to tell you that the results of our
recent survey of the hotel and catering industry give a completely different
picture.
The survey carried out for us by London Economics covered large and small
establishments throughout the country and clearly showed that the
introduction of a statutory minimum wage of Pounds 3.40 per hour in the
manner suggested by the Labour party would have the following effects:
an increase in labour costs of at least 30 per cent, partly because of the
need to maintain differentials;
an increase in prices;
a reduction in job opportunities and career development openings for young
people;
fewer opportunities for part-timers, especially women.
In these times of recession, surely voters will not want to pay more for
food and related services, particularly those with families. Also, they
would rather have a job, or even a part-time or casual job, rather than no
job at all.

FT  06 APR 92 / Letter: Free market and CDs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr STEPHEN LOCKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, You describe the decision of the Office of Fair Trading not to refer
compact disc suppliers to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission as a blow
for Consumers' Association ('Inquiry into CD prices ruled out', March 30).
This is an exaggeration. When we first raised the problem of inflated CD
prices in the January 1990 issue of Which?, we were not able to point to any
specific abuses of competition which might warrant an MMC referral. In
particular, we made no allegations about collusion, or scale monopolies, or
major barriers to entry. Our main concern was to draw attention to the
subject and put pressure on manufacturers and retailers to cut prices in the
interests of encouraging and expanding an under-developed market.
After a further two years of price rises and falling production costs, and
in the middle of a deep recession, that message is stronger than ever. Vinyl
LPs are disappearing fast, leaving a huge gap in the market for the 70 per
cent of households which do not yet own a CD player - in many cases because
the discs are simply too expensive.
What we seem to have here is straightforward, old-fashioned failure of the
free market, and of entrepreneurs to seize what ought to be a profitable
opportunity to achieve mass sales of CDs. One interesting parallel is with
perfume prices, which after years of tight control by manufacturers are now
being cut by a new, aggressive force in the market, Eau-Zone.
If the OFT report does no more than draw attention to this issue, it will
have served its purpose well.

<TEXT>
Sir, Your article on the political demise of Gerhard Stoltenberg, Germany's
defence minister ('Germany shoots itself in the foot', April 1), is
surprising. Several issues are at stake. First, a senior minister in the
federal government has not obeyed the will of parliament concerning the
supply of the balance of 15 tanks to Turkey.
This is apparently the second time that this has happened. Is it not welcome
that a minister, admittedly after long delay, has finally taken political
responsibility for his ministry's action or lack of action?
The second issue is why it is wrong to condemn Iraq for dealing with the
Kurdish problem but right for Turkey to do the same.
Third, the whole issue has nothing to do with the question of coalition
government.

FT  06 APR 92 / Arts: Epsom Downs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ST GEORGE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bristol Old Vic until 25 April (0272) 250250.
All are equal above, under and on the turf: discuss. That is what Howard
Brenton's Epsom Downs sets out to do, testing the sentiment that the Derby
belongs to everyone. The Bristol Old Vic energetically rekindles the jubilee
flames of Brenton's 1977 social drama: this is a busy, fizzy evening, long
on social comment and short on plot.
Brenton has always leaned on contemporary events for dramatic matter. In
1980, A Short, Sharp, Shock was a kick at Tory misery; in 1985 came Pravda,
a two-armed jab at Fleet Street with David Hare; and 1990 brought Moscow
Gold and the trials of Mikhail Gorbachev. Brenton writes counter to the
natural state of affairs in society. His dissident snap-shots of England
tend to fade. But the Derby Day milieu for Epsom Downs does not date, only
the participants.
Behind Brenton's canvas stands that great Victorian picture by WP Frith. One
of Brenton's characters says: 'England at peace on Derby Day, it's just a
picture'. Through the frame, representatives of rooted English classes
parade, bred to their station in life, at war with themselves and each
other: gypsies, middle-class families, horse owners, aristocrats, life
peers, tinkers, drunks, and the ghost of that 1913 Derby, the suffragette
Emily Davison (run down on Tattenham corner by George V's colt, Anmer).
Emily Davison's spirit presides over the brawling, betting and boozing like
a national conscience. Hers is the only guiding voice. Elsewhere, Brenton
touches on racing politics with a paean to Lord Wigg ('yanking the balls off
the Jockey Club'), who established the Levy Board in 1962-63. Brenton's
strength is caricature rather than debate: he never fears the obvious. The
simple set supports this clear vision. Elgar's cello concerto drifts over a
green sward; people and litter arrive, telling of a despoiled environment.
The cast of nine under Ian Hastings' direction performs with zest and wit.
Each takes several roles; Lesley Nicol as a worried mother, revivalist
preacher, drunk and lunatic is consistently engaging, as is Nigel Betts as a
grandfather, owner, bookmaker and horse. The Derby is a riot of incident,
and the effects - simple and apt. Lester Piggott wins after a taxing run on
The Minstrel.

FT  06 APR 92 / Arts: Eileen Gray
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SUSAN MOORE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'Eileen Gray' continues at the Design Museum, Butlers Wharf, SE1, until July
5.
Industrial perforated metal mesh is the stuff of a folding screen; a
standing light brazenly bares an undisguised tungsten tube; chairs contrast
gleaming chrome with matt black leather. It is difficult to appreciate that
most of the Eileen Gray furniture on show at the Design Museum was conceived
before 1930. It is revealing that much of it was made more or less
yesterday.
Not long before her death in 1976, aged 98, Eileen Gray was 'rediscovered'.
'It is odd how no one has paid homage to Eileen Gray for 30 years:
considering that the last person to do so was Le Corbusier,' the architect
Joseph Rykwert wrote in Domus in 1968. Exhibitions of her work - not only of
furniture, furnishings and fittings, but of her architectural projects, too
 -were staged in Vienna, London, Paris, and toured the US.
At the beginning of the Seventies, her early, Art Deco lacquer furniture
found fabulous prices at auction. By the end of the decade, her minimalist
'design classics' were being reproduced in London by Zeff Aram and in Paris
by Andree Putman. The woman who had been dismissed as a mere decorator was
hailed as a pioneer of Modern design.
The current small 'Designer Profile', tucked into a corner of the cavernous
Design Museum, tells us little that we did not already know and omits a
great deal. Only the generously proportioned Lota Sofa, with its plump
salmon pink canvas cushions and silky black and cinnabar lacquer side box
units, alludes to her early Paris interiors. It is hard to imagine it as
part of a bizarre, opulent scheme - informed by Cubist and African art - of
exotic woods, lustrous lacquers, imaginative lighting effects, abstract
rugs, and animal skins. Like so many of her pieces, it seems hauntingly
contemporary.
Her early work is in danger of being dismissed because it was decorative.
The daughter of aristocratic Irish parents, Gray had learnt the technique of
oriental lacquer at a workshop in Soho while studying at the Slade in 1898.
She moved to Paris in 1902, and 20 years later opened a shop, Jean Desert,
as an outlet for the lacquer screens, furniture, lamps, divans, mirrors and
rugs made in her two workshops.
She was patronised by the couturier and connoisseur Jacques Doucet, and
modiste Suzanne Talbot. Coco Chanel commissioned the striped rug on show.
Her schemes began to attract the attention of avant-garde designers and
architects: JJP Oud of the Dutch de Stijl group; Le Corbusier; and the
Romanian architectural critic Jean Badovici.
Badovici encouraged her to take up architecture and in 1926 they
collaborated on her first house, E-1027, in Roquebrune in the South of
France. Practically everything in it was made in her workshops or to her
specification. Completed in 1929, and much admired, it prompted Gray to
close down Jean Desert and concentrate on architectural projects.
She was to build only two houses, both for herself. None of her other
progressive schemes were realised, apart from the Paris studio designed for
Badovici which made ingenious use of restricted space. With their furniture,
furnishings, fixtures and fittings - even down to an aluminium junction box
 -E-1027 and her second home, Tempe a Pailla, near Menton (later sold to
Graham Sutherland), are near perfect expressions of the functional, informal
small house.
Far from representing a break with her previous designs and interiors, these
highly individual schemes reflect a honing of ideas and of language, now
unequivocally Modernist. The Gesamtkunstwerk of E-1027 had its roots in
earlier interiors, as did her experimention with unusual industrial
materials. A row of tubular steel chairs of the 1920s by Marcel Breuer, Mies
van der Rohe and Le Corbusier - icons of the Modern Movement - make the
point that Gray was also experimenting with similar materials and new
construction techniques.
There is a vestigial luxury too. The pneumatic Bibendum Chair, a fine
example of the transition of an idea from the factory floor to the sitting
room, was supremely comfortable as well as pleasing to the eye, light,
inexpensive and easy to clean. What is so striking about Gray's brand of
rationalism is its humanity. She never forgot that her 'units' were homes.
Colour was reduced to monochromes but rich textures remained.
Much of what is exhibited is of enduring appeal. There is the padded leather
Transat chair slung within a lacquered frame, copied by Frank Stella for his
own use. A bold lacquer screen is a chequerboard of black blocks and voids
that defines space and is penetrated by it. The elegant, ocean-linerish
S-Bend Chair made for outdoor use, neatly folds for storage. An occasional
table is devised so that its base can slide under a bed or armchair; a
corner of a bathroom mirror pivots to suit the user.
Gray's designs for flexible, multi-functional furniture, various
space-saving storage units, and for prefabricated 'Tube' houses, reflect the
prevailing concern to come to terms with the realities of post war life and
provide low-cost, compact and functional housing. Similarly, the reappraisal
of her work in the past two decades reveals the ultimate sterility of
Modernism if divorced from the needs of human beings, in mind, body and
spirit.

BBC2's contest to find the Young Musician Of The Year used to be a fairly
serious affair. Perhaps it still is, but the programmes have deteriorated;
so far this year the music has come a poor second behind chat. Interviews
with the contestants have been played literally over the top of their
performances so that the music can scarcely be heard. Perhaps now that we
are into the category finals (piano today) that malarkey will cease and
music will come into its own. (7.30).
Those panting to hear the party leaders are in luck. World In Action (ITV,
8.00) presents the 'Granada 500', where voters from a marginal constituency
question Major, Kinnock and Ashdown. Later, in Panorama on BBC1 at 10.00,
David Dimbleby interviews John Major.
Horizon (8.10 BBC2) reports on the growing belief among linguists,
archaeologists and geneticists that human communication can be traced back
to one original language. Cutting Edge (9.00 C4) offers yet another
documentary on police work, this time in the London borough of Hackney where
four payments have already been made this year in compensation for alleged
wrongdoing by the police.

FT  06 APR 92 / Arts: Atys and Amadis in New York
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW PORTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
To have one Lully opera playing in a city is something of rarity: in New
York, both Atys and Amadis have been playing. Atys is the great Arts
Florissants production, on a return visit to the Brooklyn Academy. Its
glories have been sung in these columns often enough to need no comment
beyond that the execution, lovingly directed by William Christie, still
becomes (after 70 performances, 36 of them at the Opera-Comique, eight in
Brooklyn) ever more precise, more moving, more bewitching. It's a revelation
of what Baroque opera can be and mean.
Amadis is put on by the Moving Breaths Theatre Company, which plays in the
Gene Frankel Theatre, a Greenwich Village space. There are eight soloists, a
chorus of four, no dancers, and a slogging modern string sextet around a
loud electric harpsichord. The production was announced (wrongly) as the
first Amadis since 1771, and we were promised 'a testimonial to a nation
inactive on its own ground and over-active on the territories of others ..a
primer on how to romanticize your past in order to enrich your barren
present ..a rip-roaring romp through the Old West for the sake of our
crumbling America.' It was no such thing.
I liked Moving Breaths' sharp staging last year of Monteverdi's Madrigals
Amorous and Martial, whose military metaphors were given Gulf War
representation. But the Amadis was coarse, clumsy, and ill-executed. An
electric harpsichord and string sextet slogged through the score. In a
theatre where a whisper would tell, the singers tended to bellow. Lully
reverted to being the pre-Rameau bore we used to think him before the Arts
Florissants Atys lit our understanding and played upon our most responsive
emotional nerves.
At Mannes College, Donizetti's comedy I pazzi per progetto had its American
premiere. He's another composer misunderstood - one of the most lovable,
honest, and generous of men, in tragedy or in comedy communicative about
human beings as they live, laugh, and suffer in our strange old world. Too
often we see the real, rounded characters of Don Pasquale and L'elisir
busied and bustled into farce. And the Mannes Pazzi was overproduced and
overdesigned - albeit deftly and inventively. Far too much went on. Amy
Kaiser was a lively conductor, but the show would have been twice as
enjoyable had it been half as strenuous and half as loud.
Judith Weir's King Harald's Saga - a three-act, nine-soloists-and-chorus,
epic grand opera, compassed in about 12 minutes by one unaccompanied solo
soprano (it was created by Jane Manning) - has caught on in America as a
concert tour-de-force. I'd not seen it staged until the American Chamber
Opera mounted it, cunningly produced by Roger Sullivan, in decor by Queen
Margarethe of Denmark, and with Margaret Astrup as a protean, effortlessly
able soloist.
It opened a triple bill in the Marymount Manhattan Theatre - an East-side
mini - Bayreuth. There followed Dominick Argento's songcycle The Andree
Expedition, for baritone and piano (Hakan Hagegard introduced it here a few
years ago), also dramatized, by Andrew Joffe. With skill and subtlety, Brent
Porter played the three Swedes who rashly set out in a balloon, in 1897, to
reach the North Pole, perished, but left behind letters, diaries, and film
that was found and developed when their bodies were discovered some 30 years
later. Argento is a cunning, imaginative chooser and compiler of texts and a
stirred, able composer. The Andree Expedition was moving.
Rimsky-Korsakov's two-men-plus-orchestra opera Mozart and Salieri closed the
bill. Mozart was played by a tenor called William Walton, but the
performance was otherwise unmemorable.
The Met's annual Lenten and Easter revival of Parsifal assembled what I
suppose could be considered the world's leading cast: Siegfried Jerusalem,
Waltraud Meier, and Kurt Moll, conducted by James Levine. But only Moll was
wholly, consistently satisfactory. Meier - one hears that she now has
heroic-soprano ambitions and is contemplating Isolde - had lost her low
notes, was uneasy on the peaks, and only in the middle register remained her
usual eloquent self. Jerusalem, apparently undirected, was embarrassingly
skittish at times. But all three gave seasoned, sure performances. Levine's
conducting was slow; he has said 'When I'm in the middle of a Parsifal
performance, my idea of heaven is that it will never get over'. He holds the
world record for duration, and gets nearer to his heaven each year. Yet the
Met orchestra played with such beauty of tone that one didn't mind.
Otto Schenk's production is as flat and featureless as his Met Ring.
Schneider-Siemssen's decor is decorative, large-scale tinselly. But most of
the right things happen. After the Robert Wilson Parsifal in Houston, in
which many striking Wilson things but few Wagner things happened, it was
good to get back to something like the work that Wagner composed.

FT  06 APR 92 / People: Engineering change at Trafalgar House
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Ian Robinson's appointment to the board of Trafalgar House is yet another
sign that the embattled conglomerate's future growth lies more in
engineering than in its shipping, property and Ritz hotel businesses.
Last July, Trafalgar House greatly expanded its engineering interests by
taking over Davy Corporation; Robinson's appointment to the main board is
part of a reorganisation of the management of a division which now accounts
for roughly half of the group's near Pounds 4bn turnover and 40,000
workforce.
Robinson, 49, and a chemical engineer, joins Allan Gormly, 54, chairman of
Trafalgar House's engineering division, who went onto the main board in 1986
and is regarded as a possible successor to Sir Eric Parker, the group's
chief executive.
Robinson has spent 28 years in the petrochemical and oil and gas industries.
However, he is a relative newcomer to Trafalgar House, joining its John
Brown subsidiary in 1986, and has risen quickly through the ranks. He will
assume responsibility for the group's process engineering and construction
operations, roughly equivalent to a quarter of Trafalgar House's total
business.
By going on to the board he has leapfrogged Ted Bavister, 58, who continues
as deputy managing director of the engineering division. Bavister, the next
president of the Institute of Chemical Engineers, is regarded as one of the
industry's elder statesmen.
Meanwhile, in a bid to improve its battered City image, Trafalgar House has
hired a new public relations director. Tim Halford, 45, spent 10 years as
the European pr man for Armand Hammer, the late boss of Occidental
Petroleum, and was most recently group public affairs director of Grand
Metropolitan.

FT  06 APR 92 / Management: When the time comes for shareholders to stand up
and be counted
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Anybody who believes that shareholders will provide the key to better
corporate governance may be a little optimistic. Consider the case of Tace,
maker of environmental control equipment, versus its institutional
shareholders, probably the most public and fierce of all recent boardroom
battles. The protagonist, Michael Sandland, chief investment officer at
Norwich Union and chairman of the Institutional Shareholders Committee, won
kudos from the press, the Bank of England, and the public at large for his
fight to rid the company of what was perceived to be profligate, inefficient
and arrogant management.
But behind the scenes, Sandland's activities were questioned by his own
board as well as by fellow shareholders, and in the end, only one other
institution agreed to help pay the bill for the effort. Norwich Union and
Framlingtonalone were left to split a Pounds 60,000 bill for solicitors'
services,with other costs paid by Tace's new management. To the public eye,
it was a case of fund managers robustly defending their clients' interests
after attempts to bring in a new and more efficient management failed.
As the battle dragged on, institutions representing some 40 per cent of
Tace's shares succeeded finally in toppling the management, only to have the
company become the target of a successful takeover bid by Cambridge
Electronics. But privately, quite another story emerged.
According to an account of the battle prepared by KPMG Peat Marwick, the
accountants, the matter began when a Tace director, concerned about
excessive remuneration for the chairman, contacted the Bank of England.
The Bank then advised the shareholder to contact Sandland, holder of 5 per
cent of Tace's shares. It then appears that when attempts to replace the
chief executive voluntarily were likely to be unsuccessful, Sandland lined
up two other shareholders, Framlington and GT Management, to help him oust
the board.
But early on, GT dropped out, while other institutions needed active
hand-holding to maintain their support throughout the affair.
For his part, Sandland will not comment on the specific events.
However, he argues that the desire to keep such battles out of the public
eye - as well as the lack of resources available to fund managers to engage
in them - makes institutions reluctant to engage in concerted action.
'You are unlikely to get some kind of pan-institutional framework because
shareholders are unwilling to surrender to a third party their proxy
rights,' Sandland argues.

FT  06 APR 92 / Management: Getting directors on board - The deliberations
on the Cadbury Committee
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Corporate governance is all about finding ways to make companies run better.
But while the virtues of good governance are as controversial as apple pie
and motherhood, the mechanics are another matter.
'Boards of directors must have the freedom to drive their companies forward,
but within a framework of accountability.' So says the opening paragraph of
the latest draft of a report on corporate governance from Sir Adrian
Cadbury's Committee on the Financial Aspects of Corporate Governance.
Yet maintaining a board's vitality while ensuring that it is answerable to
its shareholders is not easy. There are wide disagreements among the
affected parties as to the best way forward.
Sir Adrian's committee, which bears his name, has been grappling with just
that for nearly a year.
In addition to the Accounting Standards Board, the accountancy profession
and the London Stock Exchange which sponsored the committee, its members
come from the Institute of Directors, the Bank of England, the Institutional
Shareholders Committee, the 100 Committee of Finance Directors, the
Confederation of British Industry and academics.
What distinguishes this committee from others is that it represents all the
affected parties. And each has its own goal. Jonathan Charkhom, the Bank of
England's man on the committee, says: 'The Bank has a natural interest in
the strength of British industry. We so often see the results of bad
corporate governance.'
The stock exchange and the ISC say their goals are to improve the
information for shareholders, while the IOD would like to find a framework
that is as loose as possible for better board governance.
A final version of the committee's recommendations is due in late May; Sir
Adrian fears the public may be expecting far more than the report will
deliver. For one thing, it will not address the headline-grabbing issue of
executive pay, except to suggest that best practice is to disclose it.
'Executive pay is part of the much bigger question of board accountability,'
Sir Adrian said.
He claims that despite the disparate membership, there have been no
significant disagreements. However, private conversations with members
suggest another story. While most members agree that 'prescriptive'
solutions are impractical, some clearly favour greater regulation than
others.
Perhaps unusually for a such a committee, none of its discussions have yet
been aired publicly. However, it is expected that the final report will
include
A code of practice for directors.
A suggestion that audit and remuneration committees consist entirely of
non-executive directors - a requirement which would force listed companies
to have at least two non-executives.
A requirement to disclose all non-auditing functions performed by the
auditing firm for a fee.
A recommendation that directors terms be three years at most
A new stock exchange listing requirement which would force companies to
disclose the extent to which they comply with best practice recommendations.
The last of these is, according to Sir Adrian, the guarantee that the report
will effect change. 'I believe standards need to be raised,' he said. 'I
have no interest in just producing another piece of paper.'
But privately, some groups of institutional shareholders have dismissed the
listing requirement as falling short of what is needed. The Institutional
Shareholders Committee, for instance, has called for disclosure of
directors' performance-related pay and some of its more hard-line members
want that disclosure to be a requirement of stock exchange listing. That
view is also likely to be supported by the Institutional Fund Managers
Association.
However, Sir Andrew Hugh Smith, chairman of the stock exchange, argues that
'directors' pay is not in my view a great issue'. There is no need, he says,
to require companies to place remuneration packages before shareholders at
annual general meetings or even to make their disclosure a listing
requirement. Simply requiring companies to explain their failure to disclose
key bits of information is sanction enough, he argues. 'If companies are
coming under criticism from shareholders, they don't like to be seen as
different from other companies,' he says.
Sir Andrew dismisses suggestions from some committee members that it was
concern for the stock exchange's competitive standing - the fear that it
would be unable to attract foreign companies for listing - that led him to
that stance. Indeed, he says, it was the desire to improve disclosure to
shareholders that led the stock exchange to urge the committee's formation
in the first place.
Sir Adrian says that he believes the committee's most important work lies in
the area of financial reporting. The largest part of the report will deal
with directors' responsibilities to ensure the accuracy of information
contained in financial accounts.
'There is a financial tag to everything which happens in a company. We have
concentrated on the obligation to report and the accountability which goes
with that,' he says.
A third draft of the report, currently circulating to members, is nearly 40
pages long with appendices.
The Confederation of British Industry, whose members will be most directly
affected by the recommendations, is pressing within the committee for no
recommendation of any specific board structure, nor any requirement for
minimum numbers of non-executive directors.
The arguments against regulation are those with which Sir Adrian has
expressed sympathy. 'My view is that prescriptive solutions do not work,' he
said. Furthermore, even requiring set numbers of non-executive directors is
no guarantee that they will be of sufficient quality.
That view is echoed by Blynth Jenkins, director of corporate affairs at the
IOD. 'If one was to impose a code of practice by regulation, it would stifle
enterprise and innovation,' he argues.
The desire to reach a consensus may account for the committee's reluctance
to get tough on disclosure or other thorny issues. For many of the measures
proposed by others on the committee are opposed by the CBI - seen as the
main constituency for the report's final conclusions. The CBI opposes
proposals to expand the auditing functions, to ban auditors from performing
non-auditing services or to disclose the terms of directors' service
contracts.
Some of the thorniest questions raised in committee meetings relate to the
role of non-executive directors and whether granting them any special
monitoring or oversight role undermines the concept of the so-called unitary
board.
While two-tiered boards are common practice in the European Community,
unitary boards giving equal responsibility to all directors are favoured on
both sides of the Atlantic. While the committee has rejected any departure
from the unitary board - the CBI and the Institute of Directors remain
concerned about the the role of non-executive directors.
'If you give non-execs a policing function, are you not admitting two-tiered
boards as a de facto situation?' Jenkins asks. The CBI agrees: 'We believe
that a single-tier structure with no legal or formal distinction between the
role and duties of executive and non-executive directors makes it clear
where responsibilities lie; with the board both collectively and
individually'.
In its last few weeks, the committee is going to have to grapple with the
question of how boards must be structured to enable them to police
themselves.

Peripatetic businessman John Jackson, chairman of SD-Scicon and Graseby, and
vice-chairman of Ladbroke, is to become chairman of Mishcon de Reya, the law
firm which Lord Mishcon founded in Brixton before the war and which has more
recently made a name defending clients against libel actions.
Mishcon believes it is the first time a businessman rather than a lawyer has
been appointed chairman of a large law firm instead of a senior partner, and
follows moves in the 1980s to put the management of the firm on a more
professional business footing. For his part, Jackson believes his
appointment reflects an awareness that law and accountancy are important
parts of the business community and could do with an injection of commercial
mettle.
Jackson - who was called to the bar but never practised - is not averse to
unconventional career moves. After 28 years with British Philips, where he
is still a director, he launched a career on his own, largely to indulge his
interest in new ideas and the start-up of high technology businesses.
Now 62, he spent five years during spare time at Philips making his family
self-sufficient in milk, eggs, meat and vegetables, using borrowed land on
which he paid rent of 'one fat lamb per acre per year'.
Not content with just walking around Annapurna in Nepal on a sabbatical from
Philips, he collected over 2,000 packets of seeds which he has distributed
to European botanical gardens.
Lord Mishcon, 75, who has a minimum of five more days as Her Majesty's
opposition chief legal affairs spokesman, will also continue to advise
clients as an active consultant.

FT  06 APR 92 / Management: Learning the lesson of ABC
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British companies which rushed to embrace supposedly solve-it-all
accountancy systems, like activity-based costing (ABC) in the late 1980s,
have jettisoned all pretence at using them in the recession.
So say Bob Sweeting, of the School of Management at the University of
Manchester Institute of Science and Technology (Umist) and Roy Davies, of
the accountants Price Waterhouse. Two years ago, Sweeting and Davies studied
management accounting methods among 700 businesses.
They found wide confusion about ABC and how it was supposed to work. This
was generally because companies had tried to graft new systems onto existing
ones that were poorly structured in the first place. Sweeting and Davies
have since followed up with a series of workshops around Britain for the
companies they studied.
The techniques were being sold hard by management consultants before the
recession. 'But like all fashions and fads, they fall by the wayside in hard
times and people revert to basics like immediate cash and stop thinking
about the longer term,' Davis adds.
Done properly, he says the methods are invaluable because they provide a
complete view of the profitability of every corner of the business and the
impact of each department on the costs of every other.
Sweeting says the minority who have applied modern techniques correctly have
a better view of the dynamics of their businesses and have been able to make
better decisions about what they can afford to cut in the recession.
The workshops showed that larger companies have kept investing in improving
their accounting methods during the recession, while medium-sized or smaller
ones have tended to let people go or drop their consultants.
'For many companies, developing ABC or similar techniques is seen as
discretionary spending. It is one of the first things to go,' Davies says.
But installed properly, rather than bolted on as a panacea for already
muddled score-keeping, the process becomes self-financing, he says.

RESULTS DUE
Results are beginning to come through from retail groups, whose financial
years generally end later than other companies to take in the January sales.
Today see figures from Laura Ashley and tomorrow from Next, fashion groups
which have both been through difficult times.
Laura Ashley should report a small profit of perhaps Pounds 2m, compared to
a Pounds 6.7m pre-tax loss. But this will be wiped out by exceptional items
as Mr Jim Maxmin, the new chief executive, gets to grips with the business,
taking the loss to high single figures.
Next, which reported a Pounds 223m net loss last year, is expected to make
Pounds 10m pre-tax, though reports of strong trading in the shops suggest
there could be a pleasant surprise. A final dividend is likely.
Tomorrow also see figures from Tesco, the supermarket group, for its year to
end February. Forecasts are for around Pounds 540m before taking account of
profits on property sales, compared to Pounds 417.1m, showing that the food
retailers are still beating the recession. Tesco will have had the benefit
of last year's Pounds 572m rights issue for a full year.
'Minus something large' was an analyst's reaction to a question about
Costain's 1991 results. More prosaically, estimates of pre-tax losses to be
announced by the construction and mining group on Wednesday revolve around
Pounds 30m, compared with a Pounds 5.5m profit.
While Costain might have made about Pounds 10m after paying interest, the
losses follow writedowns in the value of housing land and a Pounds 12m
provision for the Channel Tunnel contract. A below the line charge is also
expected after the sale of the investment property portfolio.
Hope of a final dividend died some time ago. While gearing will have been
helped by a rights issue and the property sale, some anxiety remains about
debt levels.
Land write-downs also apply to AMEC, the construction and engineering group,
which is expected to report pre-tax profits reduced from Pounds 63m to
little more than Pounds 20m on Thursday.
Another to benefit from a rights issue last year, the remaining cash-in-hand
should enable it to maintain an uncovered dividend. It might even gain some
praise for its tight control of cash on the contracting side.
Waterford Wedgwood, the crystal and ceramics group, is expected to post a
full-year pre-tax loss of IPounds 2m tomorrow. Brokers anticipate an IPounds
3m tax charge on profits in the Wedgwood ceramics division, making a
post-tax loss of IPounds 5m and earnings per share of around 0.6p.
The group's much-awaited recovery to profitability is being held back by the
continuing recession in the US and UK and slack demand for its up-market
products, and the outlook for 1992 is not encouraging. The future of the
loss-making Waterford crystal arm hinges on the outcome of a consultancy
report due by mid-year.
Queens Moat Houses, the hotel group, is expected to report full-year pre-tax
profits on Wednesday of Pounds 92m, only slightly down on last year's Pounds
94m. The performance of its UK hotels will be watched with interest, as will
any sign of a slow-down in Germany.

FT  06 APR 92 / Economics: All eyes in UK financial markets fixed on general
election outcome
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FINANCIAL markets in the UK are likely to remain nervous ahead of Thursday's
general election, with concern particularly over the possibility of
investors shifting large sums out of sterling.
There is also data published this week which will provide fresh clues on the
extent of the slowdown in Germany and the faltering recovery in the US.
In the UK, credit business data due out today will shed light on whether
consumers are starting to feel happier about borrowing, a development which
economists believe is necessary to kick off recovery from the 18-month
recession.
The figures are expected, however, to provide little encouragement to those
looking for a strong economic revival after the election. The City is
expecting the figures to show a net repayment of some Pounds 50m of credit
in February, following a run of similarly weak numbers stretching back to
the autumn.
Among the highlights of the week for statistical buffs are manufacturing
output figures for Germany, and the latest details of capital spending in
the US.
There will be interest, too, on the progress of German wage talks. These
could have an impact on German inflation, which in recent months has risen
sharply.
The following is a list of the main items of data being published during the
week, and other notable events. The numbers in brackets are forecasts
provided by MMS, the financial information company.
Today: US, 4th quarter financial report on business outlook for retailers
and manufacturers; UK, February credit business (repayment of Pounds 50m);
Switzerland, March unemployment rate (2.4 per cent), Germany, engineering
wage talks in North-Rhine Westphalia.
Tomorrow: Luxembourg, European Community economic and finance ministers
meet; US, February wholesale trade and consumer credit (up Dollars 0.5bn);
Sweden, February unemployment rate (10.9 per cent); Canada, January rise in
wages and salaries.
Wednesday: Switzerland, March consumer prices index (up 0.3 per cent on
month, 4.9 per cent on year); Canada, March housing starts, vacancy data and
car sales.
Thursday: UK, general election; Germany, construction worker wage talks; US,
March producer prices index (up 0.2 per cent on month), 4th quarter capital
spending, unemployment claims for week ending March 28 (450,000), money
supply data for week ending March 30 (M1 down Dollars 3.4bn, M2 down Dollars
6.5bn, M3 down Dollars 9.2bn).
Sweden, March consumer prices index (up 0.3 per cent on month, 2.4 per cent
on year); Australia, March employment decline (10,000) and unemployment rate
(10.7 per cent); Canada, February vehicle sales.
Friday: US, March consumer prices index (up 0.3 per cent on month), February
housing completions, March real earnings; UK, March retail prices index (up
0.1 per cent on month, 3.8 per cent on year; excluding mortgage interest
payments, up 5.5 per cent on year).
Netherlands, February consumer prices index (up 0.3 per cent on month, 4.1
per cent on year); Norway, March consumer prices index (up 2.3 per cent on
year); Australia, February retail sales (fall of 1 per cent on month);
Canada, March employment growth and unemployment rate (10.6 per cent),
February department store sales.
During the week: Germany, February industrial production, manufacturing
output, orders, retail sales (up 0.4 per cent on year); France, February
monetary data; Denmark, February unemployment (10.9 per cent), current
account.

FT  06 APR 92 / N Sea oil output dips
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UK OIL production slipped to 1.9m barrels a day last month, a decline of
80,000 b/d from February, according to County NatWest in Edinburgh.
The fall in output was partly a result of shutdowns on the Flotta pipeline
as the new Piper B oil platform was tied into the grid.
Low oil prices and weak world demand are causing many companies to focus on
cost-cutting and rationalisation this year. That might see many North Sea
operators cutting capital expenditure and scaling down ambitious oil
exploration programmes.
The International Energy Agency, the west's energy watchdog, pointed to
signs of a slight recovery in world oil demand in its latest market report.
Demand in OECD countries rose by 400,000 b/d in the first quarter, 1.5 per
cent above last year's level.

FT  06 APR 92 / Midlands companies focus on efficiency
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
   Paul Cheeseright, Midlands Correspondent
COST CONTROL and cash management, allied to business planning, will be the
most important elements in running a company over the next few months,
according to the owners of private companies throughout the Midlands.
Those priorities have emerged from a survey of 200 private companies,
largely in manufacturing and construction, carried out by Coopers &amp; Lybrand,
accountants, in Birmingham. More than four in five of those companies have a
turnover of up to Pounds 10m.
The aim of the survey was to gain an insight into business concerns as the
economy prepares to move out of recession, which, with uncertainty about
future economic policy caused by the general election, has forced companies
to pay the highest attention to raising efficiency and cutting overheads.
The emphasis on costs and cash, mentioned by more than nine out of 10
companies in the sample, gives the impression, Coopers said, 'that whilst
little can be done to affect external factors, management is looking at
controlling internal factors to compensate for this'.
As to finance, only one in four companies felt the need to increase
borrowing significantly and 21 per cent acknowledged that they were under
pressure from their banks. Fewer than half the companies regarded the
raising of capital as a serious issue.
Coopers said the attitude towards capital-raising reflected the British
practice of financing business with overdrafts and credit rather than
long-term funds. It warned against 'boom and bust' cycles.
The main business organisations have already warned that many small
companies will face difficulties when they need extra cash to finance an
expansion of output as the recession fades.
