FT  06 APR 92 / Sharp rise in prisoners on remand
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE NUMBER of prisoners held on remand in police cells has risen by 50 per
cent since the end of January, when Mr Kenneth Baker, the home secretary,
described the situation as 'unacceptable'.
Last Friday 1,846 prisoners were being held on remand in police cells in
England and Wales, the highest number for more than six months and almost
double the average daily total in 1991.
The cost of keeping a prisoner on remand in a police cell is put at Pounds
220 a night, compared with about Pounds 50 a night in a prison. The total
cost of keeping prisoners in police cells in 1991 was estimated at Pounds
85m. That was Pounds 68m more than it would have cost to keep them in
prison.
The cost of keeping prisoners in police cells is expected to rise to more
than Pounds 100m this year.
Last week, launching the Labour party's law and order proposals, Mr Roy
Hattersley, the shadow home secretary said Labour would pay for extra police
officers and crime prevention programmes by reducing numbers held on remand
in police cells.
Labour would make room for all remand prisoners to be held in the prison
system by shortening the average time spent on remand before trial and by
removing some categories of offenders, such as maintenance payment
defaulters, from the system.

FT  06 APR 92 / Complaints against brokers up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COMPLAINTS about securities and futures brokers increased slightly last
year, according to a report published today, John Authers writes.
Nevertheless, the complaints bureau of the Securities and Futures
Association, the self-regulatory organisation for the industry formed a year
ago by the merger of two other watchdogs, was given a clean bill of health
by the first annual report of its complaints commissioner.
The report shows that 1,206 complaints were received by the SFA. Of those,
73 should have been made direct to the Stock Exchange, leaving a total of
1,133, compared with 1,115 in 1990 and 1,025 in 1989.
Mr Keith Woodley, the authority's complaints commissioner, found that in
general the complaints had been reviewed carefully and quickly.
He did not force the SFA to reconsider any finding and made suggestions for
further action in only 12 per cent of the cases he examined.
Diameter Stockbrokers, a cut-price, high-volume stockbroker based in
Guildford, Surrey, which specialised in cheap privatisation deals, generated
206 complaints - by far the most. It ceased trading on June 7 last year and
has been declared in default by the Investors' Compensation Scheme.
Complaints were made against 158 firms, 11.4 per cent of the SFA's
membership of 1,380. In 1990, complaints were received against 9.5 per cent
of the previous regulator's membership.
Only nine firms, including Diameter, had more than 10 complaints against
them. Delays in settlement and sending share certificates were the most
common causes.

FT  06 APR 92 / Election 92: Roof falls in on the Tories' dream - The
Issues, Housing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN PLENDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HOUSING may not be an issue to rank with health or education in the last lap
of the election campaign. But if Mr John Major ceases to be the occupant of
10 Downing Street on April 10, the workings of the housing market will have
had a great deal to do with it.
At one end of the market many voters have discovered that the joys of
ownership - still trumpeted in the Tory manifesto - confer no more than the
right to a negative return on their investment and an obligation to pay the
highest real rates of interest since the Depression.
At the other, cardboard cities stand as a disconcerting reminder to the
electorate of such hard-edged legacies of Thatcherism as the withdrawal of
income support for youths aged 16 and 17.
Home ownership, which once made huge inroads for the Tories into the ranks
of floating voters, has become a liability for them. It is wreaking havoc in
just those areas where they are at their most vulnerable - the squeeze in
owner-occupied housing is largely a southern affair.
In Scotland, and in the north and north-west of England, home owners have on
average seen increases in the value of their property since 1989. The
south-east and Greater London saw year-on-year falls in the final quarter of
1991 of 7.5 per cent and 7 per cent respectively, while the comparable
figures for the south-west and East Anglia were 6.6 per cent and 4.7 per
cent.
More than two thirds of the housing stock is now owner-occupied and, says
James Barty of Morgan Grenfell, about three quarters of the owner-occupiers
are reckoned to have been Tory voters in the 1980s. Those in the north of
England were less vulnerable, he adds, because houses were cheaper so
northern home owners incurred less debt.
In the south it feels very different. Since the Tories came to power in
1979, mortgage debt has gone from about 30 per cent of personal disposable
income to more than 70 per cent. That indebtedness is disproportionately
weighted to the southern half of Britain.
Those who bought at the peak of the boom in 1988 were confronted soon
afterwards by a 50 per cent rise in interest rates. While rates have since
come down, they remain sky-high in real terms, thanks to the government's
one great economic success story: disinflation. The more Britain's inflation
falls, the higher the real rates of interest imposed through the exchange
rate mechanism threaten to become.
The chief victims are the baby-boomers, the products of the high birth rates
of the late 1950s and early 1960s. Britain's inflationary psychology meant
that they were disposed to buy at a much younger age than their French or
German counterparts. The Tories' rhetoric and their carrot-and-stick
policies - financial deregulation followed by the withdrawal of tax reliefs
in 1988 - helped stampede people aged 25 to 30 into premature financial
commitments.
Today many of them have no equity in their home; some have seen the value of
their house fall below that of the outstanding mortgage; others have had
their homes repossessed. The government's attempts to stem the tide of
repossessions and kick-start the market with temporary relief from stamp
duty appear so far to have made little economic or political impact.
It would probably be wrong to assume that low-income home buyers have been
uniformly hit. A recent survey by the Council of Mortgage Lenders found that
former council tenants showed a better-than-average record on arrears and
repossessions. They tend to be older; and as well as having a more
significant equity in their home because of the sale discount, they did not
have to spend heavily on setting up a new home. Yet there seems little doubt
that the famous C2 voters are over-represented in the group of home owners
who have suffered most from the squeeze and fear most for their jobs.
The negative wealth effect in housing and the related overhang of debt
largely explains why the consumer has failed to spearhead a recovery.
Shell-shocked borrowers helped propel the savings ratio from little over 4
per cent before the peak of the housing boom to more than 10 per cent last
year. While the poll tax is on its way out, high mortgage rates leave many
feeling overtaxed.
None of the main parties is proposing to offer relief for the housing market
except through modest tinkering. But Labour will undoubtedly make things
worse for the top segment of the market with its proposed income tax
reforms.
There is a clear relationship between real income growth and house prices.
Morgan Grenfell estimates that by squeezing top people's incomes Labour
could reduce their house prices by 5-10 per cent, while simultaneously
reducing their ability to service the related debt. This could well hamper
the emergence of a consumer-led recovery in the south-east.
None of the main parties has more than piecemeal remedies for problems of
the housing market, including the shortage of rented accommodation.
Labour commits itself not to legislate retrospectively in the private rented
sector and to consult fully before making reforms. The Liberal Democrats,
like Labour, have measures to address the specific problems of the homeless
in finding rented accommodation. The Tories already have their Pounds 100m
scheme for those sleeping rough in London, though there is no explicit
commitment to continue with it.
But there are no specific targets. And in none of the manifestos do the
issues appear to rank particularly high on the list of priorities. Yet
Dominic Byrne of Shelter, which campaigns for the homeless, points out that
the results of its Mori poll suggest that the public thinks of homelessness
and housing as being at least as important as health and education.
From the top to the bottom of the market, people's expectations appear low.
Not a happy omen for a visibly flagging Tory campaign.

FT  06 APR 92 / Election 92: Tory defeat expected to topple Willis
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RENEWED pressure on Mr Norman Willis to retire early as general secretary of
the Trades Union Congress is expected if Labour wins the election.
Some senior TUC and trade union officials say privately that unless Mr
Willis is replaced by Mr John Monks, the able deputy general-secretary, the
TUC will be bypassed and the four or five biggest unions will deal directly
with a Labour government.
Mr Willis, having struggled for eight years as general secretary with a
government hostile to the unions, will not go willingly. He has also just
completed the first year of a four-year term as president of the European
TUC.
The TUC has the opportunity to restore some of its lost credibility in
helping a Labour government to steer through a potentially ambitious
programme of industrial relations changes.
But as one TUC official said: 'The TUC has adapted much less well than many
of the bigger unions to the culture changes of the past decade'.
Industrial relations reforms will not be the top priority for a Labour
government, especially one which has a small majority, and unions'
expectations have not been raised high.
But Labour party and union officials agree on what an ideal three-stage
timetable might look like. The first stage would consist of symbolic
gestures with few immediate practical consequences. These would include
signing the Maastricht 'social chapter' and letting unions back into GCHQ,
the government's secret communications centre. Immediate changes, not
requiring primary legislation, could also be made to beef up employment
protection.
The two main pieces of primary legislation would be a recognition act and an
act of positive rights for employees which would be named after Mr Tony
Blair, Labour's employment spokesman.
The recognition act would allow unions incremental representational rights,
depending on how many employees voted for such rights, culminating in full
collective bargaining rights if more than 50 per cent of the workforce voted
in favour. This act could be controversial, although it has the backing of
Mr Jim Wallace, the Liberal Democrat employment spokesman, and might be
pushed through early.
The centrepiece of the Blair Act would be the establishment of works
councils for employee consultation in all workplaces above a certain size.
Labour has decided not to revive the idea put forward in the Bullock report
of worker directors. But it is envisaged that the works council
representatives, elected from the whole workforce and not from the unions,
would have power of co-decision with employers in several areas including
training, equal rights and work content.
Much of the women's equality legislation, and equal rights for part-timers,
to which Labour is committed, would be pushed through the European Community
and the minimum wage would probably be the responsibility of Labour's
Treasury team.

FT  06 APR 92 / Election 92: West Lothian - Ballot Box
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
With the creation of a Scottish parliament the flagship of Labour's policy
for Scotland, it is remarkable that the party has not devoted any of its
election press conferences in Glasgow to saying in detail what it proposes.
We know from the manifesto that it would have power over internal affairs in
Scotland and would be elected by an 'additional member system' of
proportional representation. But Labour has not said publicly how many MPs
it wants, how the electoral system would work and what the Scottish
administration would look like.
Privately it says that it would like between 120 and 140 MPs, the majority
elected by the first-past-the-post system, topped up from party lists. There
would be a Scottish chief minister with about 12 ministers (there are five
Scottish Office ministers now).
But Donald Dewar, who hopes to be secretary of state for Scotland, sounds
uneasy when asked what he would do if and when there is a Scottish chief
minister as well. And Labour has convinced few but its own supporters that
Scotland should continue to have 72 Scottish MPs at Westminster (its
population merits 58).
Thus the real constitutional debate will begin when Labour, if it forms a
government, publishes its Scottish parliament bill. English MPs of all
parties will then want their say, just as they did the last time when
devolution was debated at length in the late 1970s.
In a hung parliament, no doubt a handful of Plaid Cymru members would want
their say as well, not to speak of the Ulster MPs and, above all, the SNP
who will watch the Scottish legislation like hawks.
All of which makes for some late nights and much parliamentary bargaining to
keep a minority government in office.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The preference among children aged seven to 12 is plainly for John Major in
No 10 Downing Street and, failing that, a return to Margaret Thatcher. A
survey for Monster Munch on behalf of Smiths Crisps showed that nearly half
of them supported Major, 17 per cent wanted Thatcher back and only 14 per
cent in favour of Neil Kinnock.
The nationwide sample of 500 children found that their primary concerns were
stopping cruelty to animals (89 per cent) and the protection of the
environment (88 per cent). Asked what should be done to make parliament more
fun, more than 75 per cent said that MPs 'should behave like adults for a
change'. Monster Munch is a very large kind of crisp.

FT  06 APR 92 / Election 92: The polls are still worth watching - Ballot Box
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The opinion polls during the last weekend of the campaign seem broadly to be
pointing in the same direction: a narrow Labour lead over the Tories, but
not sufficient for an overall majority, and therefore the probability of a
hung parliament.
There are more polls to come, however, and the general lesson of the last
few decades has been to poll often and to poll late if you want to get it
right. Even then, there can be pitfalls.
In the general election of 1945, which required the sort of swing needed
today to give Labour outright victory, there was a spectacular polling
success.
The Gallup poll predicted that Labour would win 47 per cent of the vote and
the Tories 41. But since polls were a new phenomenon in those days and
Gallup was the sole practitioner, hardly anyone took any notice. If they
had, the Tories might have campaigned differently. The actual result was
Labour winning 48 per cent and the Tories 40 per cent.
The next big milestone in British polling history was in 1970, when ORC
achieved the dream result of being the only polling organisation to get the
outcome almost right. It did so by re-interviewing some of its earlier
respondents at the last minute and correcting the forecasts for differential
turn-out.
In a survey of 257 respondents, ORC found that only one had switched from
Tory to Labour while 14 had gone from Labour to Tory. It thus discovered the
'late swing'. Even then, it underestimated Ted Heath's Tory victory by two
percentage points.
The ORC experience did not mean that all the polls were more accurate ever
after. In the election of October 1974, all of them overstated the margin of
Labour's victory, which in the end was an overall majority of only three.
One other point to note: in the seven general elections between 1964 and
1983, the party that was ahead in the final polls did less well on the night
than had been predicted in the polls. In 1987, in spite of some blips in the
polls, the Tories sailed home. So keep watching the findings until the end.
There is still room for changes - and surprises.

<TEXT>
BRITAIN'S Sunday news-papers have voted. Five favour the Tories, three
Labour and one, the Independent on Sunday, has declined to give a clear
opinion.
From the Murdoch stable, the News of the World says that Mr Major is 'the
better bet for safeguarding our economy'. Its stablemate, The Sunday Times,
backed Mr Michael Heseltine for party leader and has roundly cursed the
quality of Mr John Major's campaign. The editor, Mr Andrew Neil, returns to
this in a signed article. But its editorial says Labour would probably bring
economic crisis by Christmas and offers 'wholehearted' endorsement for the
Tories.
No doubts at the Sunday Express. Headed 'Vote Tory with pride', its leader
invites readers to consider 'the video recorder and the car . . . the range
of foods in the fridge . . . for the vast majority of our people life has
never been better'. The Sunday Telegraph, with senior writers divided
between Thatcher loyalism and tactical retreat, says 'it would not be a
catastrophe if Labour won on Thursday', but warns of Labour's taste for
Brussels bureaucracy, devolution and constitutional reform. It hopes that
the Tories' 'noble hopes' do not perish.
The Mail on Sunday has long admired Dr David Owen, who returns the
compliment by setting out his advice in its pages. Along with Dr Owen, the
paper likes the down-to-earth Mr Major - his mounting of the soapbox is
considered 'a seminal moment'. The editorial proclaims: 'give Major his
chance to be great'.
The Mirror group tabloids are Labour by profession. The Sunday Mirror
focuses its arguments on improving the condition of women, but The People
prefers a 1945 Daily Mirror slogan, declaring 'vote for them]' - that is
'all who have been disadvantaged by 13 years of appalling Tory rule'.
Labour, it says, is waging 'a war against the money-grabbing, me-first
mentality'.
For The Observer, Labour brings the risk of public-sector pay inflation,
less innovation in the public services and a tax plan which will not 'help
the country out of recession'. But the Conservatives are to blame for 'a
coarsening of the texture of British life' and a 'demoralisation and
physical squalor' that no civilised society should tolerate. Labour,
preferable on Europe and constitutional reform, is, it concludes, 'worth
taking a chance on'.
That leaves only Mr Ian Jack, editor of the Independent on Sunday. In a
signed leader, he says the Thatcher government grew 'corrupt and arrogant'
and the party so blind to the Scottish question that a Conservative victory
will lead to secession. For these and other reasons, Mr Jack's cross 'will
not go next to the name of the Conservative candidate'.

FT  06 APR 92 / Levy withdraws threat to leave Israeli government
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   JERUSALEM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A FRAGILE unity was restored to Israel's ruling right-wing Likud party
yesterday when Mr David Levy, the foreign minister, withdrew at the last
minute a threat to resign from the government that had exposed deep
divisions in the Likud less than three months before a general election.
Mr Yitzhak Shamir, the prime minister, broke the deadlock after a week of
crisis by agreeing to grant most of Mr Levy's demands. The two men met an
hour before the weekly cabinet session at which the foreign minister had
said he would tender his resignation.
Although reluctant to give ground, Mr Shamir clearly decided the
continuation of the row with Mr Levy risked fatal damage for the party in
the election campaign against a resurgent Labour opposition.
In a signed agreement with Mr Levy, Mr Shamir agreed to grant the foreign
minister's supporters increased representation both in Likud internal
institutions and in government appointments. Mr Levy himself was guaranteed
his post as foreign minister in any Likud-led government and allowed to
nominate another minister.
The agreement formalised Mr Levy's standing in the party, which he felt had
been undermined. It met his complaint that his supporters - mainly from
Israel's Sephardi, or Oriental Jewish, community - had been conspired
against in recent party internal elections by Mr Shamir and his Ashkenazi,
or European allies, Mr Moshe Arens, the defence minister, and Mr Ariel
Sharon, the housing minister.
Both sides tried to play down the ethnic element. But it was clear that it
had put at risk the Likud's traditional supremacy among the majority
Sephardim, many of whose leaders have recently sharply criticised Mr
Shamir's leadership.
Mr Levy immediately pledged to work to unite the party 'in order to heal the
wound'. But the electorate may not be convinced by the sudden switch from
furious feud to bland brotherhood.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN Jiang Zemin, the Chinese Communist party chief, lands in Toyko today he
will be confident that his Japanese hosts will avoid the sensitive human
rights questions that would inevitably be asked during a visit to Europe or
the US.
The five-day visit, the first by a party general secretary since 1983, will
be another important step towards international respectability for the
Chinese leadership, which is still tainted by the crushing of the
pro-democracy movement three years ago.
Jiang wants to direct Japanese attention to a just-completed sitting of the
Chinese parliament, which re-embraced the principles of economic reform and
strengthened the position of reformers within the Communist party.
However, he could face queries over a touchy territorial issue, the
ownership of five uninhabited islands in the South China Sea known to Japan
as the Senkaku group and to China as the Diaoyutai group.
Japanese say that a likely invitation from the Chinese leader for Emperor
Akihito to visit Beijing later this year will receive a non-committal
response until both countries agree that the islands are Japanese property.
Japan will ask that Jiang use his influence to dissuade North Korea from
developing nuclear weapons, as Tokyo has been made uneasy by Pyongyang's
persistent failure to permit inspections of its nuclear-related sites.
Beijing and Tokyo will congratulate each other on a fast-expanding economic
relationship, although Jiang is likely to warn that a rapid increase in
Japanese exports could become a bilateral problem.
Chinese officials have expressed concern about a 59.8 per cent increase in
Japanese exports in February, compared to a year earlier, and a 36.1 per
cent increase in exports to Hong Kong, many of which are thought to have
entered southern China.
Tokyo insists that the dramatic increase is a natural result of the surge in
China's economy over the past year, and that it also reflects the rapid
development of export-oriented factories using components made in Japan.
If the human rights issue is raised, it will be done in the traditional,
polite way, with Japanese officials encouraging Jiang to improve relations
with the US and then making an indirect reference to Washington's concerns
about human rights.
Jiang will ensure he is not too deferential to his hosts. During a 1983
visit, the late Hu Yaobang bowed in front of Japanese leaders, and this was
cited by China's elderly revolutionaries as a good reason for his dismissal
in 1987.

ministers to seek compromise in Cairo
</HEADLINE>

   CAIRO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ARAB foreign ministers are to meet in Cairo early this week in what may
prove a last-ditch effort to find a compromise in the Libyan affair before
United Nations sanctions come into effect on April 15.
Arab League officials, speaking after Colonel Muammer Gadaffi, the Libyan
leader, had bitterly denounced the 'Crusader West' in a defiant speech, said
the seven-member committee of Arab foreign ministers charged with defusing
the Libyan crisis will meet in Cairo tomorrow.
The committee, which groups Egypt, Algeria, Tunisia, Syria, Libya,
Mauritania and Morocco, was formed several weeks ago to seek a face-saving
end to the crisis, but its efforts have proved ineffectual.
Col Gadaffi said at the weekend Libya would never surrender its 'sons' to an
'enemy country'. He repeated his outright rejection of Security Council
resolution 748, which set the April 15 deadline for an air and arms embargo
against Libya for its refusal to yield two men accused of the 1988 bombing
of a Pan Am airliner over Lockerbie, Scotland.
The UN is also pressing Libya to make available four of its citizens,
including Col Gadaffi's brother-in-law, for questioning by the French
authorities over the 1989 downing of a French UTA jet over Niger. A total of
441 people were killed in the destruction of the two aircraft.
The US meanwhile repeated its instruction to its nationals to leave Libya
immediately after Col Gadaffi's furious outburst on Friday in a speech
marking the end of the Moslem fasting month of Ramadan.
The Libyan leader called on Moslems to close ranks against 'western
Christian crusading forces'. 'We too have to beat the drums and close ranks
and sharpen our swords and get ready for the confrontation.'
Col Gadaffi's 45-minute oration came a day after the Security Council
condemned Libya over attacks last Thursday against foreign missions in
Tripoli. Venezuela's embassy was virtually destroyed in what were believed
to be officially sanctioned demonstrations.
Libya has appealed to the International Court of Justice to rule that it can
try the suspects in its own jurisdiction; but this avenue has been rejected
by western states, who believe the terrorist attacks were ordered by the
Libyan leadership in retaliation for the 1986 US bombing of Libya, in which
Col Gadaffi's adopted daughter was killed.

ANOTHER political feud has broken out between the South Korean government
and Mr Chung Ju Yung, the founder of the Hyundai conglomerate, with
authorities alleging that a Hyundai subsidiary illegally funded Mr Chung's
Unification National party (UNP) in last month's National Assembly
elections.
The charges, which Hyundai denies, coincided with an announcement by Mr
Chung that he would probably run as the UNP's candidate in December's
presidential elections.
The Office of Bank Supervision (OBS) claims that Hyundai Electronic
Industries borrowed 4.8bn won (Pounds 3.6m) from the Korea Exchange Bank to
help finance the creation of the UNP in January.
Korean law stipulates that such loans should only be used for business
purposes.
Hyundai contends, however, that the money came from the proceeds of Hyundai
shares sold to the group's employees.
The UNP said the OBS allegations were part of a campaign by the authorities
to harm Mr Chung's reputation and divert attention from charges of
government vote-rigging in the recent parliamentary elections.

FT  06 APR 92 / Ministers back some elements of open energy market

A SMALL majority of EC energy ministers has supported elements of draft
European Commission laws to liberalise the energy market. During their first
discussion of the plans at the weekend, ministers backed proposals to end
monopoly rights over electricity production and the construction of energy
networks.
However, formal ministerial discussions of the directives next month are
still likely to stall on the controversial core element of the Commission's
liberalisation package, which would give energy users greater access to gas
and electricity networks.
The majority of ministers at Saturday's informal meeting - led by the French
and Dutch representatives - expressed reservations about these proposals,
known as third party access.
'We're convinced that third party access would very seriously compromise the
strengths of the present system, which guarantees investment, security of
supply and equal treatment of consumers,' said a senior French energy
official.
Continued opposition from big member states could push back the Commission's
ambitious deadline of the beginning of next year for implementing the gas
and electricity directives.
Mr Antonio Cardoso e Cunha, the EC energy commissioner, said on Saturday he
still hoped discussions would be completed this year.
He was pleasantly surprised at most ministers' tentative support for an end
to exclusive rights and for the 'unbundling' of integrated energy companies'
accounts, which would improve cost and price transparency. Most member
states were unenthusiastic about the whole package during earlier technical
discussions in Brussels.
'Today there was much greater openness to look for the positive elements
which could be accepted,' said one official from the UK, the Commission's
strongest supporter on energy liberalisation.

FT  06 APR 92 / France and US fail to resolve air route row
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE risk of disruption to flights between France and the US moved closer
over the weekend, as the Saturday deadline set by Washington and Paris for
the resolution of a row over route capacity passed without agreement.
Paris has said that failing an accord, it will limit the rise in US
transatlantic traffic to and from France to 15 per cent, well below the 40
per cent increase the US Department of Transport has demanded on behalf of
the eight leading US carriers. Washington has warned it would probably
retaliate.
This is the latest round in the struggle by Air France and other European
airlines against competition from larger US groups on the most attractive
transatlantic routes. It also worsens US-French trade relations, already
strained by disagreements over farm subsidies in the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade.
Air France yesterday repeated its determination to resist. 'In giving
satisfaction to US demands, one would create overcapacity on airline routes
between France and the US, which would seriously harm the profitability of
all companies on these routes,' said Mr Bernard Attali, chairman of Air
France. The French national carrier derives 15 per cent of annual sales from
transatlantic flights.
The fact that two US airlines, TWA and Continental, were under Chapter 11
protection from creditors 'was not compatible with the principle of fair
competition' set out in the Franco-US accord on air transport, he added. The
US argues that coming from state-owned Air France, this argument is hard to
accept.
Air France had no information yesterday on how or when Paris planned to act,
but civil aviation authority officials had earlier warned that they were not
afraid to take 'authoritarian action'.
France opposes Washington's demands on the grounds that it believes traffic
between the two is set to rise by only 10 per cent this year. Thus a 40 per
cent rise in the US allocation would further erode France's share of the
transatlantic market. It has fallen steadily to 30 per cent since US airline
deregulation, with the US carriers taking the remaining 70 per cent.

<TEXT>
DEVELOPED and developing countries have agreed after two years of often
acrimonious debate to join in a 'global partnership' to restore and preserve
the earth's ecosystem.
However, its impact is diminished by continued failure to resolve the
problem of paying for such a massive environmental clean-up in the teeth of
economic recession.
The accord was reached at the UN on Saturday in an all-night meeting of the
preparatory committee for the Earth Summit conference to be held in Rio de
Janeiro in June.
Mr Maurice Strong, the conference secretary general, estimated that Third
World states would require Dollars 125bn (Pounds 72bn) a year in outside aid
for new environmental programmes - Dollars 70bn more annually than they
receive now in all financial assistance. He projects even larger sums for
the long term.
Questions still to be resolved include the transfer of environmentally sound
technologies to developing countries, institutional arrangements for
overseeing policies, and protecting the rapidly depleting forests.
Among the principles agreed is the obligation of polluters to pay for
cleaning up, the need for environmental protection even without prior
scientific evidence, and the responsibility of states not to damage the
environment of other states.

FT  06 APR 92 / Voters get to grips with ballot reform: President Cossiga
leads the way to the polls as Italians put ruling coalition to the test
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Francesco Cossiga hauled the press out of their beds early
yesterday for a photo-call of him casting his vote only half an hour after
Italy's polling stations opened at 7am.
'Do you always get up so early, president?' he was asked by a resentful
journalist. 'Yes,' he replied mischievously.
Mr Cossiga was one of the first to experience the new voting procedures
introduced last year by referendum, intended to lessen the abuses
surrounding the system of preferential votes.
In addition to casting a vote for a party, voters have throughout the
post-war period been entitled to select up to four preferred candidates on
the electoral list, and it was sufficient either to make a cross or write a
number. In Rome and southern Italy this was widely exploited by the
Christian Democrats and Socialists to ensure the candidates selected by the
party apparatus were voted for. In the north, the preference system was
little used.
Yesterday, under the revised rules only one preference vote was permitted
and this was only valid if the candidate's name was spelled out. Several
commentators argued yesterday that the single preference system could still
benefit the well organised Christian Democrats in the south to the detriment
of other parties.
Christian Democrat politicians have been found distributing stencils with
candidates' names, in theory justified by the need to help illiterates
required to write their preference. However, seven candidates in the south
are said each to have ordered 140,000 such stencils.
The change in preference voting was recognised by the promoters of the June
1991 referendum as only a partial reform of the electoral system and the
next parliament will be under pressure to make further changes.
Yesterday's vote was on the basis of a complex procedure of proportional
representation. Italy is divided on a geographical basis into 32 electoral
colleges, which provide the 630 deputies and 315 senators. The largest of
these is that of Rome, with 54 seats for the lower chamber, and the smallest
Val d'Aosta, with one.
When the total valid votes in each college are counted after the booths
close, this will be divided by the number of seats plus two - an equation
which produces the electoral 'quotient'.
This quotient represents the number of votes each party needs to obtain a
seat. Usually it is impossible to allocate all seats in this way: in 1987,
16 of the seats were left spare. To fill these, the remaining votes in
excess of each party's quotient, or the entire vote if a party has failed to
reach the requisite quotient, are transfered to a national electoral
college, where a new quotient is worked out.
The system encourages small parties to enter the ring. Yesterday there were
50 groupings, with voters in Rome obliged to chose among 27 different
parties. Small parties may gain no seat in a local electoral college but
with their votes carried forward into the national college, they stand a
good chance of picking up a residual seat because the number of their votes
at this stage is often greater than the larger parties'. This, however,
means smaller parties need ultimately more votes to obtain a seat than the
big parties.
Similar considerations apply to the senate.

FT  06 APR 92 / A new order eludes E Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCES WILLIAMS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE economies of eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union are slipping
ever deeper into a 1930s-style depression and, with no respite in sight,
enthusiasm for a new economic order has given way to pessimism.
In its annual economic survey published today the 40-member United Nations
Economic Commission for Europe (ECE) urges a much greater commitment to the
success of economic reform by western governments. Otherwise, it says,
increasing economic strains could lead to disillusion and impatience with
both the 'market' and democracy.
The ECE estimates that domestic output fell by some 14 per cent in eastern
Europe last year, bringing the aggregate drop in output since 1988 to nearly
25 per cent. Many must now be wondering whether 'the invisible hand of the
market is really an iron fist', it says, drawing parallels with the
inter-war depression which saw a 29 per cent slump in output in North
America between 1929 and 1933.
In the former Soviet Union/Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), net
material product (output excluding services) fell by 15 per cent and GNP by
17 per cent, after falls of 2 and 4 per cent respectively in 1990. Another
large fall in CIS output seems probable in 1992, the survey says.
In the light of eastern European experience, 'an aggregate decline of 25-30
per cent between 1989 and 1992 would not be implausible'.
Further cuts in already low living standards and the prospect of rapidly
rising unemployment this year could threaten the fragile political and
social consensus for market reforms in the CIS economies unless there is
substantial help from abroad, the ECE says. It says the most urgent task
facing the CIS is to curb inflation and budget deficits, which means
resolving the conflict between fiscally autonomous republics and ineffective
central monetary control.
The UN agency proposes an open CIS trading area with separate currencies,
accompanied by currency reform and stabilisation measures in each republic.
It says a payments union, modelled on the European Payments Union for
western Europe in 1950-58, would help avoid excessive contraction of trade
during the transition towards currency convertibility.
The picture in eastern Europe is dark, the ECE says. Output levels continued
to fall sharply last year, there has been a sharp rise in joblessness and
most people have had to bear large cuts in living standards.
Although western aid and assistance to eastern Europe and the former Soviet
Union has increased in the past year, and there have been important
improvements in access to western markets for eastern goods, 'the amount of
genuine aid (grants and concessionary finance) has been small', the ECE
says.
The survey notes that western aid for eastern Europe and the CIS countries
is far less than the sums implied either in a 'Marshall Plan equivalent' -
Dollars 16.7bn (Pounds 9.7bn) a year - or in the suggestion by Mr Jacques
Delors, EC president, to provide support equivalent to the Dollars 23bn a
year the Community spends on its own depressed regions.
The ECE repeats its call for a 'Second European Recovery Programme',
parallelling the Marshall Plan for US aid to post-war western Europe.

FT  06 APR 92 / Poland to seek EC loan to bolster reforms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   WARSAW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
POLAND plans to ask the European Community later this year for a Dollars 1bn
(Pounds 570m) loan to shore up the government's painful economic reform
programme and stave off the threat of a rapid rise in inflation.
Mr Andrzej Olechowski, finance minister, told the Financial Times that
Poland needed the loan to assist it in financing a large projected budget
deficit for 1992 without adding to inflationary pressures. He said he had
sounded out Mr Pierre Beregovoy, the new French prime minister, and senior
German officials on the idea and their response was 'not negative'.
The prospect of such a loan request may stir unease among EC governments,
which are anxious to support Poland's pioneering efforts to transform its
economy but which have been alarmed in the last few months at signs that the
reforms have been thrown off course.
However, Mr Olechowski made clear that he would not formally make the
request until Poland had concluded a new agreement with the International
Monetary Fund, negotiations on which will re-commence if and when the Polish
parliament, the Sejm, approves the proposed 1992 budget.
Warsaw's existing accord with the IMF was suspended last year when Poland
failed to meet the required economic targets. But Mr Olechowski was told by
senior IMF officials when he visited Washington a month ago that the
proposed 1992 budget, which provides for a deficit of Zl 65 trillion
(million million) - Pounds 2.8bn - the equivalent of 5 per cent of gross
domestic product, would not constitute an obstacle to the resumption of
talks.
An IMF agreement is also critically important for Poland's efforts to gain
relief on its external debt of more than Dollars 40bn. In June it is due to
embark on negotiations with the London Club of commercial bank creditors, to
which it owes some Dollars 11bn.
Mr Olechowski, who took office just over a month ago after his predecessor
resigned in a disagreement over policy, is widely credited with injecting
some order into economic policy-making. He has also improved Poland's
relations with the international financial community after a period of
uncertainty.
Only two months ago, the World Bank warned the government that there was an
imminent danger of hyperinflation if the government failed to bring its
spending more closely in line with revenues. Now the government believes
inflation for the year as a whole will be 45 per cent, down from 70 per cent
last year.

Nightmare begins to fade - Is the debt crisis over? / Examining the present
position
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN FIDLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE prospect that Brazil and Argentina will soon have outline debt
restructuring agreements with commercial banks has raised hopes that the
final chapter on the Latin American debt crisis will be concluded before its
10th anniversary. But are the hopes justified?
In the sense in which it was originally perceived - that of a threat to the
international banking system caused by the risk of widespread default by
Latin American governments on foreign bank debt - the crisis was over some
time ago.
However, the passing of the threat to the system did not mean an end of the
threat to individual banks. Some banks, particularly those in the US, took a
long time to recover. By the time the threat of their Third World debt had
receded, they had gathered a host of new problem loans closer to home.
Nonetheless, settlements with the first and third largest debtors in Latin
America should be an immense relief to many banks.
According to bank analysts at Salomon Brothers: 'If . . . Argentina and
Brazil each sign a Brady Plan-type agreement in 1992, the nightmare of the
cross-border overhang of the 1980s will fade rapidly into memory.'
From the point of view of the debtor countries, however, the picture is
different. Their emergence from the crisis has certainly been slower and
some economies remain overloaded by debt.
It is undeniable that their prospects improved significantly following the
launch three years ago of the debt initiative named after the US Treasury
Secretary, Mr Nicholas Brady. This shifted the emphasis of the international
debt strategy towards a reduction of bank debt burdens away from one which
inevitably encouraged further enlargement of debt stocks.
The psychological boost from the Brady debt agreement - coupled with tight
fiscal control and economic and trade reform - transformed international
perceptions of the Mexican economy. Moreover, the apparent economic success
of Mexico (and Chile, which eschewed a Brady-style debt restructuring) has
had a huge demonstration effect on economic policies in the rest of the
region.
Three questions arise:
To what extent do Brady-style debt restructuring agreements allow
governments to consign their debt problems to history?
To what extent are the capital inflows to Latin America building another
debt crisis for the future?
To what extent have the various debt initiatives provided the means for the
rest of the heavily indebted countries in the region to emerge from their
problems?
When viewed purely in cash-flow terms, the benefit of Mexico's Brady deal -
finally put into effect two years ago - was extremely modest. The recent
fall in US interest rates has, if anything, provided a greater reduction to
Mexico's debt servicing burden.
Most important was the confidence engendered by the accord. The announcement
of an agreement in principle with the banks in the summer of 1990 was enough
to trigger an immediate drop in domestic interest rates, which reduced the
government's cost of servicing its own short-term domestic debt. They have
continued to fall. Business confidence also boomed, helped by the
government's decision to negotiate a free trade accord with the US and
Canada.
In the cases of Argentina and Brazil, this confidence effect is going to be
smaller. Mr Lawrence Brainard, an economist with the US investment bank,
Goldman Sachs, in New York, reckons that in Argentina much of the effect of
an agreement with the commercial banks has been discounted. In the case of
Brazil, uncertainties over the government's fiscal position and its need
(because of a lack of resources) to spread out the provision of financial
guarantees to banks, suggests increased confidence will only accrue slowly.
Furthermore, the reduction in debt may be more modest even than in the
Mexican case. Brazil's Brady debt accord will cover only Dollars 40bn of
medium-term bank debt, compared to an end-1990 total foreign debt burden of
Dollars 116.2bn; Argentina's will cover Dollars 24bn of medium-term bank
debt, compared with a Dollars 61.1bn total. What is more, to make up for its
lack of resources to provide guarantees, Brazil will need to encourage a
larger proportion of banks to lend more money, rather than give debt relief.
Thus, while Brady deals will send important signals to the financial and
business communities inside and outside the two countries, they can provide
no guarantees that debt problems will not emerge again. Indeed, this cannot
be guaranteed - many would argue - without sustained economic reform to
correct imbalances in government budgets.
Nonetheless, the suggestion that the capital inflows into Latin America are
creating a new debt crisis is probably a little far-fetched, for now,
although it would probably be unwise to dismiss the possibility out of hand.
In the case of Mexico, which enjoys a huge share of the inflows, there are
reasons - in spite of a current account deficit likely to exceed Dollars
15bn this year - that differentiate what is happening today from what
happened in the late 1970s.
The government is running a budget surplus, even before privatisation,
receipts from which are being used to pay down government debt. The current
account deficit is thus a private sector phenomenon.
The government says a large proportion of the current account deficit arises
from imports of capital goods, rather than consumer items. Provided that
capital is used productively, such imports should provide returns to allow
repayment of any debt incurred for their purchase.
A significant proportion of the inflows are of equity rather than debt,
which cannot by definition cause a debt crisis.
Much of the new debt consists of fixed-rate bonds rather than floating rate
debt. It is thus less susceptible to an upward spike in US interest rates
than was the bank debt of the late 1970s. The international bond market
should also be more sensitive to credit and supply concerns than were
international banks in the 1970s, giving more scope for rationing by price.
Scenarios can be constructed whereby all this could degenerate into a new
problem: a financial crisis in the private sector, for example, that forces
the Mexican government to step in to take over private liabilities,
comparable to Chile's banking crisis of the 1980s. No such crisis is in
sight, however, and the probability of one emerging in the near future must
be rated as negligible.
For many of the region's smaller countries, however, the problems remain.
Many are hobbled by a large debt to foreign governments, or to the
international financial institutions such as the International Monetary
Fund.
For the poorest, such as Nicaragua, more generous concessions have been made
to reduce their debt servicing burdens, although the two-thirds debt
forgiveness envisaged in the UK's Trinidad Terms initiative has failed to
meet agreement among government creditors.
For slightly richer countries, particularly those who owe most of their debt
to governments rather than banks, the mechanisms exist only to chip away at
the debt burden.
The international financial institutions have been more flexible of late, as
have their leading shareholders, in helping countries dig themselves out of
arrears in payments to them. However, they have had to retain their
paramount concern for their own financial integrity. For those governments,
such as Peru, which owe a large part of their debt to such institutions, the
future still looks very difficult.

Interest in swaps flags / Debt Conversions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE push to convert sovereign debt into equity capital for local businesses,
once seen as one of the answers to the Latin American debt crisis, has
flagged of late.
Early attempts - such as Chile's move to convert some Dollars 10bn of
sovereign debt converted either into equity or other forms of debt - have
not been repeated. The main reason: the inflationary impact of such
programmes, which has acted as a disincentive across the region (though the
fact that the discount on Chilean debt has fallen to only around 10 per cent
of face value has also removed much of the attraction in its case).
Retiring debt at its face value forces governments to print money. The
antidote - issuing government debt to soak up the extra cash in the system -
can drive up local interest rates, and has come to be seen as
counter-productive.
As a result, debt-for-equity swaps are now seriously under consideration
only in relation to privatisation issues. Such schemes do not involve any
additional cash, and so have no inflationary repercussions. In principle,
the use of debt/equity swaps for privatisations has now been embraced by
Brazil, Argentina and Peru.
Of these, only Argentina has pushed ahead with the idea with vigour. Peru
has hinted that debt conversion will be possible in the planned
privatisation of around 25 local companies, though this remains a promise
rather than a reality. The country's foreign debt has not been snapped up in
anticipation, says Mr Ric Haller, head of LDC debt trading at Morgan
Grenfell in London. 'Peruvian debt is a speculative buy,' he says.
Brazil, on the other hand, has removed much of the attraction of converting
foreign debt into equity. Foreign debt faces a compulsory 25 per cent
discount - that is, it is bought back at 75 per cent of face value, rather
than the full amount. That has discouraged the use of such debt in
privatisations so far.
Efforts have been made in some quarters to have the discount restriction
relaxed. The National Development Bank, which is responsible for the
privatisation process in Brazil, has lobbied to have the rule changed,
arguing that this would attract more investors to privatisations and
maximise proceeds from sales.
That appeal was rejected last month, and observers do not expect a change of
heart in the foreseeable future. One concession was made, though: half of
Brazil's so-called 'PFA' debt, issued at the time of the 1988 parallel
financing agreement, is now available for use in debt/equity conversions,
making some Dollars 1.6bn available for this purpose, says Mr Igor
Cornelson, director of Standard Chartered Merchant Bank in San Paolo.
Domestic debt, which is accepted without a discount, has therefore become
the main vehicle for debt/equity swaps. There are attractions to Brazil in
maintaining this position: local debt generally carries a higher interest
rate and matures earlier than foreign debt, says Mr Cornelson. Local debt is
equally available to foreign companies with operations in the country -
though as yet, there are few signs of foreigners taking an interest in such
swaps.
Almost all the Dollars 1.7bn raised through privatisations in Brazil last
year consisted of local debt: 0.3 per cent was accounted for by foreign
debt, thanks to the fixed 25 per cent discount.
That leaves Argentina as the most active exponent of the debt/equity swap in
Latin America. Through a number of privatisations in the past 18 months,
significant amounts of foreign debt have been converted. Most notable have
been the privatisations of Aeorlineas Argentinas, control of which passed to
Iberia, the Spanish national carrier; and ENTel, the telephone company, 60
per cent of which was sold to two groups led by Citibank and J P Morgan.
Questions have been raised about whether it is desirable for the control of
important Argentine assets to pass into the hands of European state-owned
enterprises or international banks - particularly if the sales are at a
discount. But as a means of retiring debt, the privatisation process looks
set to continue.

Success follows a difficult birth - Brazil / Privatisation

<TEXT>
EDUARDO MODIANO, the head of Brazil's privatisation programme, has reason to
feel proud. Rarely has a programme had such an inauspicious beginning: the
auction of the Usiminas steel mill was mired in angry riots and legal
controversy. Six months and 30 legal processes later the programme is
running so smoothly that union leaders in three state steel companies have
asked for a speeding up so they can compete with the privatised companies.
Now on his eighth sale, Mr Modiano is focusing on increasing foreign
participation. So far this has been conspicuous by its absence, partly
frightened off by the Usiminas debacle and the instability of the Brazilian
economy, and partly deterred by the programme's rules. Of the Dollars 1.71bn
raised so far only 1.9 per cent has been in the form of foreign debt paper -
most of the rest coming from privatisation certificates (which financial
institutions were forced to buy in 1990-91) and domestic debt swapped at
face value.
Consequently, Mr Modiano has been stripping away restrictions to foreign
capital. A two-year lock-in period for shares in privatised companies has
been abolished allowing foreigners to trade or sell shares the next day.
Restrictions on remittances and dividends have been removed and the period
the capital must stay in Brazil has been reduced from 12 years to six.
The 40 per cent lid on voting capital remains but Mr Modiano points out that
the Congress is due to vote on a project ending regulatory discrim-ination
between foreign and Brazilian capital. 'Once that is accepted the 40 per
cent limit becomes redundant,' he says.
He is also lobbying hard to end the fixed 25 per cent discount on foreign
debt which he believes is the main deterrent to foreign participation,
holders of MYDFAs (the main foreign debt instrument) preferring to wait for
the hoped-for Brady type renegotiation of the commercial debt this year. Mr
Modiano is battling with the Central Bank to replace this discount with an
auction system. He argues: 'At the start of the programme we envisaged
Dollars 80bn available in privatisation currencies but this restriction has
kept out Dollars 45bn (the quantity of MYDFAs).'
Mr Modiano is eager for this to be revised before the petrochemical
companies go on sale because he believes there will be much foreign
interest.
Meanwhile, the two-sale-a-month schedule has been slowed down 'to meet with
the capacity of the market'. Though the first seven parastatals all fetched
more than the minimum price, since February one sale has been delayed and
two cancelled because of lack of buyers. Mr Modiano is resisting demands to
sell off the entire steel sector by the end of this year. 'We can't sell
five big steel companies each of around Dollars 1bn in five months. We have
to move with demand.' This year he will sell two steel mills - Acesita and
Tubarao.
The programme will not be completed during the present government's term.
Brazil has a huge state sector with more than 150 state-controlled companies
and several hundred more in which it has a minority interest. Mr Modiano
plans to sell at least 14 more companies to raise Dollars 3.4bn this year.
The programme now includes 32 companies and has been broadened to include
Embraer, the state aerospace company, and Lloyd Brasileiro, the state
shipping company, as well as RFFSA, the deeply indebted state railway.
But the sector which arouses most interest is telecommunications and many
foreign investors have eyes only for Telebras. A constitutional amendment to
end the state monopoly in infrastructure is due to go before Congress.

FT  06 APR 92 / Survey of Latin American Finance and Investment (9): Plans
for a big drive - Argentina / Privatisation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BARHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ARGENTINA'S economy minister, Mr Domingo Cavallo, has spent a year planning
a privatisation drive in which he proposes to sell nearly all state
companies by 1993, raising at least Dollars 6bn.
He obviously hopes to avoid repeating Argentina's first, and chaotic,
privatisation of the national airline and telephone network in 1990. They
were sold cheaply without adequate regulation mechanisms, under terms giving
operators big profits. The result: high prices, poor service and arrogant
staff.
That might have been enough to discredit privatisation forever, except in
Argentina, where deficit-ridden, incompetent and corrupt state companies
helped push the country to the verge of economic collapse three years ago.
The memory of hyperinflation and the government's successful reforms have
made privatisation politically popular.
It has also been financially popular. The sale in December and in March of
the government's remaining 30 per cent stake in the two privatised telephone
companies boosted the capital markets, bringing hundreds of thousands of new
shareholders into the stock market and yielded almost Dollars 2bn cash for
the government.
Uncharacteristically, Argentina is now ahead of its neighbours in economic
reform.
Bolivia, among the first Latin countries to embrace free markets, has not
privatised anything. It is negotiating with Comsur, a local mining company
part-owned by Britain's RTZ, to sell the Bolivar zinc and silver mine. It
plans to sell part of its airline Lloyd Aereo Bolivia by mid-year, to be
followed by a number of small manufacturing companies. Paraguay has only
dipped its toe into the market. It approved privatisation legislation in
December and plans to start by selling Lineas Aereas Paraguayas, the
national airline. It will be followed by four other companies, which include
Latin America's only working steam railway.
Uruguay did reprivatise a bank in 1990 that had been taken into the public
sector after it had failed, but stopped there. In 1991 it passed legislation
to sell control of Pluna, the airline, and Antel the telephone system.
All that is small beer compared to Mr Cavallo's plans to sell roughly 60
companies this year. They include the national mint, leading petrochemical
plants, a water company, five freight railway networks and four energy
utilities. Even YPF, the oil company, is being heavily restructured to
prepare it for eventual privatisation.
Mr Juan Carlos Sanchez Arnau, assistant privatisation secretary, has spent
the past year drawing up regulatory mechanisms and recruiting legions of
financial, legal and technical consultants. He has even published a
privatisation timetable. The government has also fired thousands of
employees from bloated state company payrolls.
Mr Cavallo is aiming for a minimum cash inflow of Dollars 1.9bn, plus
swapping around Dollars 4bn-worth of equity for domestic and foreign debt
with a face value of Dollars 8bn. The companies will be sold with some
financial liabilities, mainly unpaid taxes and social security
contributions. Mr Sanchez Arnau says estimating revenues is pointless, since
they will depend on the amount of equity on sale. Furthermore, prices will
be set by competitive bidding.
Rather than sell all equity in utility companies, Mr Sanchez Arnau is
selling controlling stakes to operators. Part of the stock will be held by
employees. The government will retain minority stakes, selling them
gradually over the coming years on local and international equity markets.
The government expects to raise considerably less from the 30-odd companies
owned by the defence ministry, which controls Argentina's rusting
military-industrial complex. Its assets range from SOMISA, the country's
biggest steelmill, to acres of prime real estate and the duty free shops at
Buenos Aires airport. Most of the assets are manufacturing companies. The
government intends to sell 100 per cent of equity for cash.
Privatisation of the national gas monopoly and three electricity utilities
will broadly follow the British model. Companies will be broken up into
production, transport and distribution units and sold separately. They are
to compete in near-market conditions, supervised by a regulator.
The railway company's long-distance freight lines are being offered as 10-
or 30-year concessions in which operators must meet minimum investment
targets. State-owned Ferrocarriles Argentinos will run passenger trains,
which will pay tolls for use of tracks. Companies will bid on price,
investments and tolls to be charged Ferrocarriles. The Buenos Aires suburban
and underground rail systems are also being privatised, but will continue to
receive subsidies: instead of cash, bidders will offer the lowest subsidy.
Candidates for the 30-year concession to run OSN, the Buenos Aires water
company, will bid by offering the lowest water price. They will recoup their
investments in the collapsing system by installing water meters and cracking
down on water theft.

FT  06 APR 92 / Survey of Latin American Finance and Investment (8): An
envied programme - Mexico / Privatisation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAMIAN FRASER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MEXICO'S privatisation programme, the envy of much of Latin America, is
finally coming to an end this year. The government plans to sell by December
the six remaining banks, and an assortment of smaller industries, headed by
insurer Aseguradora Mexicana and plants at Fertimex, the fertiliser
producer.
All remaining state companies - such as Pemex, the oil monopoly, and the
Federal Electricity Commission - will (legally) stay in the public sector,
as dictated by Mexico's Constitution.
So will end a series of around 200 public sales in a little over three years
that have raised about 51,000bn pesos (about Dollars 17bn), or 6.6 per cent
of GDP. The lion's share of the money has come from the sale of Telmex, the
monopoly telephone company, which fetched more than Dollars 4bn, and the 12
banks, which have brought in about Dollars 10bn.
The government raised a further Dollars 340m in cash, and Dollars 545m in
debt by selling off the troubled steel companies, collectively known as
Sidermex. The finance ministry plans to sell another 5 per cent (of the 9
per cent it still owns) in Telmex next month, and its outstanding share in
Bancomer, the second largest bank.
The privatisations have gone so well in part because the process was seen to
be fair, which has encouraged rich Mexicans to participate; but mainly
because the government waited until the economic growth had picked up before
selling off the large companies.
The banks have thus been sold for an (unweighted) average multiple of more
than 20 times historic earnings, well above international valuations for
privatised banks, because their new owners are convinced that Mexico's
economy will grow by an average of about 5 per cent a year over the next
decade, and that bank earnings growth will double that. Three years ago,
with a much poorer economic outlook, the government would have been lucky to
raise half the Dollars 10bn which the 12 banks fetched.
However, the privatisations have also contributed to the economic recovery.
President Miguel de la Madrid, Mr Salinas's predecessor, closed down
hundreds of loss-making public sector companies. The shutdowns explain much
of the strengthening of public finances, and helped turn a primary budget
deficit of 8 per cent in 1981 to a surplus of the same magnitude two years
later. The primary budget surplus helped bring down inflation to below 20
per cent.
The later privatisations helped stimulate substantial capital inflows, which
are necessary to finance the burgeoning trade deficit. Mr Jacques
Rogozinski, the head of Mexico's privatisation unit, describes last May's
Dollars 2.4bn offering of Telmex as Mexico's 'ticket to the world capital
markets'. The Telmex offering of US-dollar denominated American Depository
Receipts paved the way for a series of offerings by other Mexican companies,
including a New York Stock Exchange listing by Vitro, Mexico's largest
conglomerate, and a Dollars 940m offering by Televisa, the TV giant.
Similarly, the bank privatisations - one has been sold on average every
three weeks for nine months - contributed to the momentum of economic
success that has kept the Mexican name in international markets. Money has
thus kept flooding in, and one-month interest rates, a barometer of
confidence, have fallen to 11 per cent.
The strategy has had its drawbacks. In retrospect the regulation of Telmex
has been much too lax, with the company making Dollars 2.3bn profits last
year, 77 per cent more than profits in real terms than 1990. If the Mexican
government had been less concerned about selling off the stock to eager
international investors, it could have split Telmex into two companies and
thereby promoted competition and better service. Failing that, it could have
toughened up Telmex's regulation, forcing more investment than is being
made, and cutting further exorbitant prices on international and
long-distance calls.
Further, the Mexican government has been criticised for not using
privatisations as an opportunity to democratise the ownership of capital in
Mexico's already heavily concentrated capital markets. Instead the
government has auctioned off the banks, Telmex, and other companies to those
rich businessmen who already control much of Mexico's financial wealth.
Since there are few companies left to sell, the government may have missed a
golden opportunity to turn Mexico's oligarchic capitalism into something
more broadly based.
Even though the big public sales will have come to an end by this year, the
government will continue to promote private investment in public sector
infrastructure projects. The Salinas administration has handed over the
construction of four-lane highways to the private sector, and is now selling
concessions to the private sector on those highways built by the government.
Similarly the private sector is being invited to build electricity plants,
ports, water treatment centres, train carriages, and other similar projects.
In effect, having sold off most of the state companies, the government is
now looking to privatise public sector responsibilities through lease-backs,
temporary concessions, and other creative financing schemes. In the next
three years, for example, the private and public sector will build around
3.500km of four-lane highways at a cost of Dollars 6bn-Dollars 6.7bn, of
which about half is expected to come from abroad.
Even Pemex, Mexico's hallowed national oil company, is being privatised
indirectly (and admittedly slowly). The government has already allowed
private and foreign investment in what were once 'primary' petrochemicals,
and a further opening is expected soon.

FT  06 APR 92 / Survey of Latin American Finance and Investment (11): Star
performance after slow start - Venezuela / Privatisation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOSEPH MANN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Venezuelan government's privatisation programme, announced with
considerable fanfare after the government of President Carlos Andres Perez
took office in early 1989, got off to a very slow start.
Late in 1990 the Venezuelan Investment Fund (Fondo de Inversiones de
Venezuela (FIV)), the government agency charged with carrying out
privatisation, sold the first state asset, a majority package of shares in a
commercial bank called Banco Occidental de Descuento.
But last year, Venezuela's privatisation programme put in a star
performance, obtaining Dollars 2.2bn in extra revenues for the government.
Through open bidding, the FIV sold off 60 per cent of shares in the
government's international airline, Viasa, to Iberia; sold two more
commercial banks (Italo Venezolano and Republica); a shipyard (Astinave); a
large sugar mill (El Tocuyo); a franchise to operate a cellular (mobile)
telephone system and the state-owned telecommunications company, CANTV.
By itself, CANTV would have made the privatisation programme a success. The
government received Dollars 1.89bn for 40 per cent of shares in the
telephone company, an equity package that allows the buyer to have full
operating control. The successful bid, made by an international consortium
headed by GTE (US), was Dollars 1bn above the government's minimum price.
Winning bidders must pay cash, and no debt-equity swaps are permitted.
This year, the FIV also has sold four hotels - the sales agreement was
signed a day after a military uprising was put down on February 4 - and
plans several other auctions.
Government assets to be sold this year include eight more hotels;
Aeropostal, an airline on domestic and international routes; six sugar
mills; the National Racetrack Institute (INH), which owns horse and
dog-racing tracks and other assets; the water company serving the Caracas
metropolitan area; and two or more regional electric power companies
(Enelven and Eneblar).
Other assets that may be sold are additional electric generating companies;
franchises to run toll highways; another shipyard (Dianca); a leading salt
producer (Ensal) and metal companies.
The government does not intend selling any parts of its profitable domestic
petroleum assets, but it wants to attract foreign investment for joint
ventures in exploration and production, refining and other sectors.
The government also has considerable holdings in petrochemicals, where it
works in a variety of joint ventures with Venezuelan and international
partners. There are no plans to sell any of these assets.
The government is also considering selling parts of the state-owned CVG
(Corporacion Venezolana de Guayana), which controls the country's heavy
industry. The announcement was made by Mr Jose Ignacio Moreno Leon, who as
minister of state and president of the Venezuelan Investment Fund, is the
head of Venezuela's privatisation programme. Although no firm decision has
been made, Mr Moreno said one candidate for privatisation would be Sidor,
the government-owned steel producer.
Sidor, which has had problems but recently made a profit, according to
government figures, is the largest steelmaker. Over the past few years,
Japanese investors considered starting a new steel complex in conjunction
with Sidor, but decided against it.
Aside from Sidor, the CVG group includes Venalum, the world's largest
aluminium smelter (a joint venture between the CVG and several Japanese
companies), other aluminium companies, iron ore and gold mining operations,
and Edelca, the largest hydroelectric company.

FT  06 APR 92 / Survey of Latin American Finance and Investment (6):
Investors react to free choice - Country Funds / Secondary Markets

NOT SO long ago, international investors with a penchant for the emerging
markets of Latin America found that the simplest - and in some cases the
only - way to invest was through an appropriate country fund.
Today, they have more freedom of choice. The number of funds investing in
individual countries and in Latin America as a whole is increasing. However,
some large institutional investors are shifting away from collective
investments and turning to direct investment in the underlying equities
instead, as more and more Latin American countries ease restrictions on
direct investment and as the quality of research improves. In some markets,
such as Mexico, investors can easily invest in the main stocks so fund
managers say there is little point in using a country fund.
'There has been a change: the big investors are less preponderant (when it
comes to funds) because some are buying stocks and bonds on their own,' says
Mr Lincoln Rathnam, director of the Latin American group at fund managers
Scudder, Stevens &amp; Clark.
The ability to invest directly in certain Latin American markets may have
killed off demand for funds investing in those countries. For example, the
fund management group Genesis decided to wind up its Brazil unit trust once
it became easier to invest directly in equities there.
However, there are still plenty of investors who do want to use a selection
of diversified country funds to achieve a wider spread of investments. Mr
Rathnam claims that the percentage of retail investors in country funds has
increased as the markets become more accessible, and that some institutions
continue to use managed funds as 'they can find it difficult to follow the
markets'.
The fact remains for some countries - Chile is a prime example - the laws
governing investment by foreigners still mean it is easier to invest through
a managed fund.
Foreign investors who want to buy shares in Chilean companies have to set up
a special fund. The initial capital is tied up for a minimum of three years
and realised capital gains, interest and dividends are subject to a 10 per
cent withholding tax. Mr Anthony Newsome, managing director of Genesis, says
investors often see little point in setting up their own funds when they can
choose from existing quoted funds investing in Chile.
Mr Audley Twiston Davies, of Latin American Securities, whose Latin American
Investment Trust was the top performing investment trust in 1991, points out
that while countries such as Chile, Colombia, Venezuela and Peru charge tax
on investments, there is likely to be a trend towards lower taxes on
investment gains. Again, such a move might encourage international investors
to take the direct route rather than an open-ended or closed-end fund.
While the Latin American markets were among the top performers last year,
these markets remain very volatile and naturally this is reflected in the
performance of the country funds. 'You can get tremendous upswings and
downswings', points out Mr Rathnam. Indeed, Scudder's Brazil Fund showed a
68.3 per cent drop in capital in 1990 - which Mr Rathnam blames on the poor
performance of the stock market - before gaining 131.1 per cent in 1991. The
closed-end fund is now trading at a discount to net asset value of about 5
per cent.
Such volatility can pose more of a problem for open-ended than for
closed-end funds: if investors panic as the markets fall and want to redeem
their units quickly, the fund manager must be able to sell the underlying
investments easily. As a result, open-ended funds investing in this region
tend to concentrate on the larger, more liquid stocks while closed-end funds
have more freedom to buy small- and medium-sized companies for their
portfolio.

FT  06 APR 92 / Survey of Latin American Finance and Investment (4): New
magnet for funds - Stock Markets / Secondary Markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LATIN AMERICA has been an El Dorado for fortune-hunters through the
centuries but in recent years stock markets rather than promises of gold
have attracted overseas investors.
A return to democracy throughout the region after decades of rule by
military dictatorships and totalitarian regimes, and austere but necessary
economic restructuring have been the strongest magnets for foreign fund
managers. The rash of privatisations by most Latin American governments,
which have concentrated largely on the state telecommunications monopolies,
have added to the allure.
Believers in Latin America's ability to reform its economy and its political
system have, for the most part, been greatly rewarded. According to data
from the International Finance Corporation (IFC), part of the World Bank,
investors in Latin American equities enjoyed total returns in dollar terms
of 134 per cent in 1991. Argentina provided the biggest individual return,
up 396.6 per cent in dollar terms, while Venezuela brought up the rear with
a return of 48.4 per cent.
Fund managers interested in the region but unable, or unwilling, to invest
directly in the stock market of their preferred country, have either
entrusted their portfolios to specialist brokers or bought into one of
several regional or country funds. The sharp rises in the stock markets have
been reflected in the funds. For example, Latin American Investment Trust
was the best performer of all UK investment trusts last year, with its net
asset value rising by 124 per cent.
These results have not gone unnoticed by more conservative institutions, who
had decided not to invest in Latin America because of its history of
economic problems. The lack of market regulations and of critical research
by brokers keen on securing primary business, as well as difficulty in
understanding inflation accounting practices, have also been serious
barriers for the cautious foreign investor.
To a certain extent, these fears are being addressed. Mexico, which is the
region's largest and most liquid market, has virtually adopted US Gaap
(Generally Accepted Accounting Principles) and has also introduced strict
broker requirements. The Argentine government, which is planning further
privatisation issues this year, has given more powers to its National
Securities commission to crack down on stock market manipulation. In
February, two companies were suspended for alleged tax and trading offences.
The shift in international investors' attention away from the 'Tiger'
markets in the Pacific Basin towards Latin America has been reflected in the
number of securities houses now covering the region and this should lead to
more qualified company research. Furthermore, to attract the international
investors who dislike the lack of liquidity in the domestic markets, the
larger listed companies in Mexico, Argentina, Chile and Venezuela have
issued American Depository Receipts (ADRs) or shares and Global Deposit
Shares. Brazil's Telebras is also expected to offer ADRs soon.
But for all its progress, Latin America has retained its mercurial ability
to disappoint. A case in point is Venezuela, which in February suffered its
first military coup attempt since the early 1960s. The coup failed, but it
has forced President Carlos Andres Perez to back-pedal on his unpopular
economic reform and introduce constitutional changes. The stock market made
a satisfactory recovery immediately after the abortive uprising but it has
since fallen back. According to the IFC, Caracas fell by 14.8 per cent in
local currency terms in March, after a fall of 3 per cent in February, and
by 15 per cent in dollar terms because of continued weakness in the bolivar.
In the first three months, the market has dropped 3.8 per cent in local
currency terms and 5.4 per cent in dollar terms.
The recent developments in Venezuela have reminded equity investors of their
largest, single risk: that the region remains dependent on the continued
good health of a few individuals to safeguard reform and democracy.
Specialist brokers started to cover Peru after the appointment of President
Alberto Fujimori in 1990 signalled a radical change. A first generation
Peruvian and an academic, not from the traditional power bases, his
austerity programme has allowed the central bank to concentrate on long-term
monetary policies rather than the daily devaluation of the currency, so much
so that the new sol is appreciating against the dollar. This optimism has
also been reflected in the stock market, which rose 55.4 per cent in dollar
terms last year.
Over the next year, the biggest gains are expected to be in the smaller
markets which are judged to be undervalued. Mr Jeremy Campbell-Lamerton, a
director at Baring Securities, is optimistic about the prospects for Peru,
Chile and Colombia.
Brazil still has some scope to surprise, says Mr Audley Twiston Davies,
managing director of Latin American Securities, since its economy is twice
the size of Mexico's and it was one of the last in the region to be
restructured.
Most brokers believe Mexico is fast approaching its full value for now,
since the beneficial effects of the Free Trade Agreement with the United
States are largely being discounted by the stock market.

FT  06 APR 92 / Survey of Latin American Finance and Investment (5): Big
rise in turnover - Debt / Secondary Markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE secondary market in Latin American debt is less that 10 years old,
having arisen from the ashes of the debt crisis of the early 1980s.
Its origins as a makeshift market in illiquid debt developed by creditor
banks have been left some way behind. Structural, economic and political
changes in recent years have boosted interest in the market.
Dealers estimate that turnover in LDC (less developed country) debt has
grown from around Dollars 10bn a year in the mid-1980s to Dollars 200bn last
year. The most actively traded LDC debt instruments, Mexico's and
Venezuela's 'Brady bonds' - debt repackaged as bonds and backed by
zero-coupon US Treasury bonds - are as liquid as some European government
bond markets.
The market has offered opportunities for high returns in recent years. In
particular, traders who have timed their positioning successfully have drawn
substantial benefits from the repackaging of old debt under the Brady plan.
The old debt 'provides cheap admission to Brady bonds', explained Mr Victor
Segal, international director of Singer &amp; Friedlander.
However, interest among institutional investors has been directed mainly
towards equity and bond offerings. The secondary debt market remains largely
the domain of banks and speculative traders.
Although the market has now recovered the ground it lost in a sharp sell-off
last October, institutional investors were scared off by that experience.
The collapse of the market last autumn halved the value of Brazil's external
debt from 40 cents at its peak to around 20 cents on the dollar, and other
Latin American debt prices also fell sharply.
Brazilian debt had been rallying on expectations that an agreement with
creditors on a debt rescheduling, under the Brady plan, was about to be
reached. The price peaked at the end of August, when Brazil put forward
proposals to its foreign bank creditors. Most traders were holding long
positions, expecting the market to climb further when agreement was reached,
a strategy which had been spectacularly successful in the case of Mexico.
When it emerged that an agreement on Brazil's rescheduling was not imminent,
the result was concerted selling by traders to reduce their long positions.
Other LDC debt was also hit, with only Mexico and Venezuela which had
already signed Brady-style agreements exempt from the fall.
Venezuelan debt was hit in February, when news of an attempted military coup
prompted a sharp sell-off, and further undermined institutional investors'
confidence in the market. Even though the coup attempt failed, concern about
political instability in the region was re-awakened. Venezuela par bonds,
which were trading at about 66 cents on the dollar before the coup in
February, are now quoted at around 59 cents.
A sizeable portion of Venezuela par bonds had been sold to institutional
investors, mainly in the US, who had been inspired by the performance of the
Mexico par bonds.
'As time has worn on, it has become clear that there is a political crisis
(in Venezuela),' said Mr Paul Luke, chief economist at Chartered WestLB.
'The honeymoon period for Brady bonds has come to an end.'
Nevertheless, the anticipation of debt rescheduling agreements continues to
provide impetus to trading in Latin American debt. Traders now expect that
agreements on the rescheduling of Brazil's and Argentina's debt will be
completed soon.
'Investors as well as traders have been actively buying' Brazilian and
Argentinian debt, according to Mr Willem Naves, head of emerging markets at
NMB. Brazilian debt had rallied from 33 cents on the dollar at the beginning
of March to 38 cents, before easing a little to end the month at around 36
1/2 cents. Optimism over an Argentinian debt agreement boosted the price
from 38 1/4 cents at the beginning of March to 41 1/2 cents at the end of
the month.
'People started to rebuild their inventory in Argentina and Brazil debt at
the end of last year,' according to Mr Luke of Chartered WestLB. 'It is
clear that, whatever setbacks there have been, they are edging towards a
Brady plan agreement.'
Once Brazil and Argentina are out of the way, smaller reschedulings are on
the cards: Peru, Panama and Ecuador are further down the line.
The Latin American debt market continues to offer a rollercoaster ride.
Dealers say that the market has become both more volatile and less liquid in
the last six months. Some firms which entered the market, or expanded their
presence, last year have pulled back a little. In the run-up to October's
collapse, many market participants had taken on very large positions, and,
in the wake of the losses they incurred, have become less willing to commit
capital.
'The market is maturing, but it takes at least one step backwards for every
step forward,' according to one trader.
OM, the Swedish options exchange, plans to introduce options on an LDC debt
index developed by FP Consult, a Paris-based consultancy, in a couple of
months. The LDCx index was launched last August, and the options were
originally scheduled for launch last Autumn.
Although the options may prove useful for dealers or investors wishing to
take a view on the broad market, its use as a hedging instrument will be
rather limited according to traders. 'If you look at the last few months,
Venezuela has been falling while Brazil has been rising,' one trader said.
In general, the market still demands the skills of a stock-picker rather
than an index-beater. Some banks already trade options on liquid Latin
American debt issues, on an over-the-counter basis.

FT  06 APR 92 / Survey of Latin American Finance and Investment (3): Capital
flow expectations surpassed - The market for public bond issues may have
reached a watershed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE international market for public bond issues by Latin American borrowers,
which re-opened in 1989, has outstripped expectations in terms of volume and
performance.
Last year, capital flows to Latin America from bonds, private placements and
medium-term notes reached Dollars 8.5bn, according to research from Salomon
Brothers. Meanwhile, the yield differential between Eurodollar bonds for
Latin American issuers and US Treasuries has narrowed dramatically, as the
perception of Latin American credits improved.
But the market may now have reached a watershed. Deals for sovereign
borrowers such as Mexico and Venezuela, and for state-owned borrowers such
as Pemex (Petroleos Mexicanos), the state-owned oil company, which set the
market on its feet, have tightened substantially, and that trend may well
have run its course.
Five-year Mexican bonds are yielding 220 basis points more than the
comparable US Treasury, the same level as other improving sovereign credits
such as Turkey and Hungary. Such spreads mean that these bonds can no longer
be bracketed as high-yielding debt. US investors, for example, can buy the
lowest investment grade corporate bonds at spreads of around 150 basis
points.
The tightening of Mexican sovereign debt is 'close to over', according to Mr
Peter Bernard, managing director in charge of Latin American finance at J P
Morgan. 'I think Mexico will need a rating increase in order to tighten too
much further.'
Mexico is rated Ba2 by Moody's, and is widely expected to be in line for an
upgrade this year. Venezuela, currently rated Ba1, could also be due for an
upgrade, in spite of fears of political instability stirred up by the recent
failed coup.
The performance of Mexico and Venezuela, the first Latin American countries
to return to the market, was helped by their outstanding commercial debt
having been restructured through the Brady plan. Although Brazil and
Argentina, the two other countries to have gained access to the
international markets, have so far failed to reach an agreement on the
rescheduling of their debt, their public bond issues have also performed
well. In fact, when Brazil's secondary market debt prices slid on
disappointment that no rescheduling agreement had been reached last autumn,
Brazil's access to the international bond market was not affected.
Spreads of Brazilian bonds have also tightened. When Brazil returned to the
international capital markets last July, with a two-year issue for Petrobras
(Petroleo Brasileiro), the state-owned oil company, the deal was priced to
yield 650 basis points above the comparable Treasury. The launch spread for
two-year public sector bonds is now between 350 basis points and 400 basis
points, and banks are trying to push spreads even tighter.
As in other sectors, borrowers, at first able to raise only one- or two-year
funds, can now borrow over increasingly long maturities. Telebras
(Telecomunicacoes Brasileiras), the telecommunications group, last month
launched a Dollars 90m deal maturing in 1997, with a put option after three
years priced to yield 450 basis points over the three-year Treasury yield.
Although there could be room for some further improvement in Brazilian bond
spreads, likely to be triggered by a debt rescheduling agreement which is
again believed to be close, the dramatic spread tightening of the last nine
months is not likely to be repeated, according to traders.
The next stage of the market's development will be to grant access to a
broader range of private sector companies. Already, an increasing number of
Mexican and Brazilian companies are looking at it.
'Once Latin American sovereign borrowers are no longer breaking the ground,
there will be more visible differentiation between corporate credits,
especially in the private sector,' said Mr Jorge Jasson, managing director
in charge of emerging markets at Chase Manhattan. 'The market will require
more careful credit analysis.'
The market, so far limited to Mexico, Venezuela, Brazil and Argentina, is
also likely to open to other countries.
Uruguay is expected to return to the capital markets shortly with a Dollars
75m deal via J P Morgan. However, the deal is not likely to pave the way for
corporate issues from Uruguay, due to the small size of the country's
economy
Some bankers say Chile is also likely to tap the international capital
markets, and would be well received. Although Chile does not need to borrow,
and there is an active domestic market for Chilean companies, some borrowers
may wish to diversify their sources of funds.
The tightening of spreads of Latin American Eurobonds has not simply been
the result of improving credit. The market has managed to attract an
increasingly broad range of investors. 'The Eurobond investor base
originally consisted of mainly offshore flight capital held in centres like
Luxembourg and Switzerland,' said Mr Miles Protter, director of emerging
markets at Swiss Bank Corporation. 'But we have had considerable success in
bringing institutional investors and fund managers into the market.'
Recently, large companies with spare liquidity have also invested in the
market, he added.
Most Latin American Eurobonds have incorporated a '144a option', which
allows the bonds to be placed with US institutional investors through the
private placement market, under the Securities and Exchange Commission's
rule 144a. The response from US investors has ranged 'from good to
disappointing', according to Mr Protter. While around 15 per cent of some
deals was placed in the US, in other cases, US institutional investors have
found yields too aggressive, compared with paper available in the US high
yield corporate, or junk, bond market.
To achieve a more diverse investor base, Mexico, in particular, has led the
way in tapping other sectors of the market, as well as extending maturity.
Banamex (Banco Nacional de Mexico) launched a Pta10bn five-year deal in the
Spanish 'matador' bond market earlier this year, while Nafinsa (Nacional
Financiera) raised Ecu100m of five-year bonds in February.
The trend towards increasing diversity - of credit, of country, of currency
and of maturity - is likely to fuel continued interest in the sector over
the next few years.

FT  06 APR 92 / Survey of Latin American Finance and Investment (2): World
appetite has been strong - Investors are attracted by strong growth
prospects / New Funding
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
HARDLY a month passes without an international equity issue from a Latin
American company, and the steady flow looks set to continue as countries
such as Brazil and Mexico proceed with the privatisation of state-owned
companies and initial public offerings in family-controlled groups.
So far, the bulk of the issuance has come from Mexico. Last year, Mexican
companies issued Dollars 2.369bn in equities, consisting of Dollars 2.016bn
in IPOs and Dollars 353m in primary issues, according to figures produced by
International Financing Review. (By comparison, international equity issues
worldwide last year amounted to Dollars 18.153bn). By far the largest
Mexican equity issue was Telmex, the telephone company, which raised about
Dollars 2.2bn.
The appetite for Latin American international equity offerings has been
strong so far. Investors in the US - and to a lesser extent in Europe and
Asia - are attracted by the strong growth prospects for the Latin American
economies now that many of these countries have become more democratic and
have started to introduce important reforms aimed at opening up the
economies.
'The ability of Latin America to deliver good economic growth in a period
when OECD countries are experiencing a slowdown has been confirmed. We
believe the 1990s will be a decade when Latin America will make up for the
wasted years of the 1980s and this view has been reinforced by the strong
stock market growth and increasing investor interest in the major markets of
the region,' says Mr Michael Hart, chairman of Latin American Investment
Trust, in the company's recent preliminary statement.
Investors point out that it has become far easier and much more attractive
to invest in the region as restrictions have been lifted and the individual
markets have become more liquid and better researched.
However, investors would still like to see further improvements when it
comes to financial information, the liquidity of some of the stock markets,
dividend yield, and insider trading regulations.
Mr Lincoln Rathnam, managing director of the Latin American group at
Scudder, Stevens &amp; Clark, points out that many of the companies in Mexico -
such as Telmex, the telephone company, and Cemex, the former state-owned
cement company - are well researched: 'Mexico is still the best-researched
of the (Latin American) countries even though the information available is
rather limited.'
Another manager adds that to all intents and purposes 'Mexico is not an
emerging market, it has emerged and is considered by many investors as being
within the North American bloc'.
While fund managers concede that the quality of the financial information
they receive has improved considerably over the past couple of years, some
complain that companies can be rather lax about providing figures on
request.
There is also a tendency to present a quarter-by-quarter comparison of
results, rather than year-on-year figures which iron out any seasonal
variations, says one fund manager.
Improving liquidity in the underlying markets has also helped to encourage
overseas investors to buy Latin American equities, either through an
international equity offering or once the company has been listed.
'The markets themselves are quite illiquid by our standards but this aspect
has been improving in the last couple of years,' says Mr Rathnam. He points
out that average daily turnover in Buenos Aires has grown from Dollars
2m-Dollars 3m in 1990 to about Dollars 45m this year. Meanwhile, turnover in
Mexico has risen from Dollars 25m a day in 1990 to Dollars 200m a day in
1992.
But whereas markets such as Brazil and Mexico can be sold at short notice,
'in general it is quite difficult to sell quickly,' Mr Rathnam says, and
that can be a problem, especially in a falling market.
Dividends from Latin American companies tend to be on the low side, with the
exception of Chilean companies. Some investors point out that overseas
demand would probably increase if companies were to offer higher dividend
yields. 'Small dividends can be a problem for a (Latin American) fund,
though on the whole the bigger investors are looking for capital gains
rather than income,' says one fund manager.
Fund managers report that some companies are starting to offer more generous
dividends to appeal to foreign investors. For example, Telmex put up its
dividend from 25 pesos to 75 pesos recently - although as one analyst
pointed out this still represents a dividend yield of less than 1 per cent.
The two Argentine telecom companies which were recently privatised - Telecom
Argentina and Telefonica de Argentina - have also attracted some attention
from international fund managers for paying above-average dividends, and
investors hope that more companies will follow this example.
With such improvements under way, the emerging markets of Latin America are
likely to remain popular with international investors over the next year,
ensuring the success of future international equity issues.

of London has undergone a sea change in only two years. More critically, so
have the perceptions of the region's own investors.
Inflows of private capital into the region trebled in 1991, according to
estimates from Salomon Brothers. An estimated Dollars 40bn flooded in last
year, compared with Dollars 13.4bn in 1990 and only Dollars 5bn in 1989.
Most of that money flowed into the four biggest economies; 40 per cent of it
into Mexico alone. Mexico received Dollars 16.1bn, Venezuela Dollars 4.8bn,
Brazil Dollars 11.6bn, Argentina Dollars 5.1bn and Chile Dollars 1.7bn.
Much of the influx represents decisions not of foreign investors but of
Latin American residents bringing home flight capital sent abroad in the
1970s and 1980s. It is no less significant for that.
Some of the incoming money is undoubtedly volatile: parked in high-yielding
bank deposits. Nonetheless, an important proportion is more permanent: of
the Dollars 15.7bn of new borrowing last year, Dollars 8.5bn was in the form
of medium-term debt, and Dollars 2.3bn in term bank lending. Portfolio
investment totalled Dollars 6.4bn and direct foreign investment Dollars
10.4bn, Dollars 3.5bn of which directly resulted from privatisation.
There is evidence that the scope of the inflows is broadening: governments
from economies as diverse as Mexico, Chile, Colombia and Peru are facing
problems neutralising the impact of incoming capital on their money supplies
and inflation rates. For many governments, it is the kind of problem they
prefer. 'It's better to have a problem with capital inflows than the
opposite,' says Mr Andres Bianchi, who recently stepped down as president of
Chile's central bank.
The flows have been brought about by a confluence of internal and external
factors. Falling interest rates, particularly in the US, have reduced the
appeal of holding dollars in bank accounts; recession in the first world has
dented returns on investments in rich countries. For many investors -
private, corporate or institutional - squeezing good returns out of their
traditional markets has been tough.
That contrasts with their recent experience in Latin America. The region's
main stock markets yielded returns of between 48 and 400 per cent last year.
In countries such as Argentina and Mexico, investment risk has been reduced
by exchange rate policies which fix parities against the dollar or offer
more or less certain rates of currency depreciation. This has encouraged
inflows to take advantage of high domestic interest rates that are a
consequence of the tight monetary policies in many countries.
The Brady initiative, launched three years ago amid heavy criticism, has
provided a framework for the easing of bank debt burdens for the most
heavily indebted countries in the region.
In the case of Mexico - which triggered the debt crisis 10 years ago by
announcing it could not meet its scheduled payments to banks - it provided
only a modest reduction in debt servicing burdens but allowed the injection
into the economy of a large dose of confidence, a commodity long in short
supply.
The predictions that debt forgiveness by banks would close access to new
foreign finance have been rapidly belied by the Mexico accord. It has also
paved the way for bank debt restructuring agreements with Brazil and
Argentina, for both of which outline accords could be in place at any time.
None of this would have occurred without the big shifts that have already
taken place in economic policy across the region. This has brought
government budgets under control in many countries, and has started to lift
the burden of inefficient state enterprise from the backs of taxpayers.
Privatisation is going ahead apace as the chart in this survey demonstrates.
Controls on capital movements have been lifted. Following the Chilean
example, private pension funds are being established and encouraged to
strengthen the institutional structure of the region's financial markets.
The prospect is for more stable, less interventionist economic management
than has been typical in the region.
At the same time, governments have transformed their external trade regimes.
Most no longer see any future in the closed, protected economic regimes
which predominated in Latin America for half a century. Free trade is seen
as a way of promoting economic efficiency and bearing down on inflation.
Governments have moved to negotiate bilateral free trade agreements and to
create free trade areas and customs unions, such as Mercosur, covering the
countries of the southern cone, and the revived Andean Pact.
The Bush administration in the US - liberated from the ideological baggage
of the cold war - has signed with 16 Latin American governments framework
accords: the first step towards free trade agreements. President Bush has
spoken of a free trade area from Alaska to Tierra del Fuego. All the
agreements await the signing of a landmark accord with Mexico and Canada,
which now looks unlikely to be settled until 1993.
Such developments open up the possibility of a big expansion in trade within
the region. Inter-regional trade now accounts for only 4 per cent of the
western hemisphere's gross domestic product, according to the InterAmerican
Development Bank, compared with 14 per cent for the European Community, and
17 per cent for the Pacific Basin countries, excluding China.
These developments also are likely to presage a broad corporate
restructuring across the region. Companies in Latin America are beginning to
look across borders in a way that made no sense before trade barriers began
to be dismantled. Similarly, companies from outside the region are beginning
to seek acquisitions of Latin American companies, particularly those in
Mexico. This impression was reinforced this month by the acquisition by
Cadbury Schweppes of the UK of the Mexican bottler and mineral water
company, Aguas Minerales.
Mr Thomas Keesee, responsible for Latin American business for First Boston
in New York, says mergers and acquisition business in Mexico has grown every
year since 1988. Then, seven transactions were completed worth a total
Dollars 1.1bn; in 1989, this grew to 15 and Dollars 2.2bn, and in 1990 to 29
transactions worth Dollars 5.1bn. Last year, the number of deals fell to 22,
but their value jumped to Dollars 14.5bn.
The pattern could be repeated throughout the region. 'If you look through
the top 500 companies in Latin America, you will see that many are parts of
conglomerates, which make sense in a closed economy and when you are
protected from outside competition. In an integrated market - as we have
seen in Europe - there is tremendous potential for restructuring
conglomerates,' he said. Mr Mark Coombs, head of ANZ's international
merchant bank, said he has at least one corporate client in the southern
cone 'aggressively seeking acquisitions in Argentina and Brazil'.
Profitable mergers and acquisition work, new finance in the bond and equity
markets, privatisations, rising stock markets, falling interest rates; all
these make for an investment bankers' paradise. Small wonder that the hotel
lobbies from Caracas to Buenos Aires, from Mexico City to Santiago are more
packed with visiting bankers than they have been since the bad old 1970s.
Small wonder, too, that worries have surfaced over whether their enthusiasm
for Latin America represents a replay of the nightmare of the debt crisis.
The attempted February 4 coup in Venezuela has shown that democracy, while
admittedly imperfect, is not everywhere secure. Neither is economic reform:
Brazil, for example, has yet to provide evidence that its fiscal position is
under control; Argentina's reform programme still has far to go; Mexico's
current account deficit is rising, some believe, dangerously fast. External
events - a collapse in oil prices, a failure of the Uruguay round trade
talks - may take their toll. The region's markets are thin and prone to
overshoot in potentially devastating fashion.
There remain big risks for investors in Latin America. For now, many
investors believe that they are more than compensated for them by the
expected returns on their investments. Provided the inflows are soundly
based, as they seem to have been up to now, this can only be good news for a
region starved of capital for almost a decade.

FT  04 APR 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Directors' Transactions
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THIS WEEK'S column epitomises the opposing forces influencing directors. On
the one side there is a fear of the potential impact a Labour administration
would have on the trading environment, coupled with the threat of higher
personal taxation. On the other is the feeling that economic recovery is
near and shares are cheap. As a result there are almost as many purchases by
directors as sales.
Shares in Iceland Frozen Food have proved rewarding over the last year,
rising from 280p to 470p. However, all the main board directors, save for
the one non-executive director, sold shares, realising more than Pounds 5m.
When six directors of Global Group sold a total of 7,150,000 shares at 24p
12 months ago, investors would have been wise to have followed suit. With
the shares now languishing at 8p three directors have bought a modest
250,000 shares in total. In the year to December 1991 pre-tax profits fell
60 per cent.
It is rare for high-profile industrialists to make open market purchases -
they usually acquire shares through executive options schemes. Lord
Sterling, chairman of P &amp; O, the shipping and property concern, bought
250,000 deferred shares after announcing better than expected final results.

RESULTS are beginning to come through from retail groups, whose financial
years generally end later than other companies to take in the January sales.
Monday sees figures from Laura Ashley and Tuesday from Next, fashion groups
which have both been through difficult times.
Laura Ashley should report a small profit of perhaps Pounds 2m, compared to
a Pounds 6.7m pre-tax loss. But this will be wiped out by exceptional items.
Next, which reported a Pounds 223m net loss last year, is expected to make
Pounds 10m pre-tax this time, though reports of strong trading in the shops
suggest a pleasant surprise. A final dividend is likely.
Tuesday also see figures from Tesco, the supermarket group, for its year to
end February. Forecasts are for around Pounds 540m before taking account of
profits on property sales, compared to Pounds 417.1m, showing that the food
retailers are still beating the recession.
'Minus something large' was a typical analyst's reaction to a question about
Costain's 1991 results. Estimates of pre-tax losses to be announced by the
construction and mining group on Wednesday revolve around Pounds 30m,
compared with a Pounds 5.5m profit.
While Costain might have made about Pounds 10m after paying interest, the
losses follow writedowns in the value of housing land and a Pounds 12m
provision for the Channel Tunnel contract. A below the line charge is also
expected after the sale of the investment property portfolio.
Hope of a final dividend died some time ago. While gearing will have been
helped by a rights issue and the property sale, some anxiety remains about
debt levels.
Land write-downs also apply to AMEC, the construction and engineering group,
which is expected to report pre-tax profits reduced from Pounds 63m to
little more than Pounds 20m on Thursday.
Another to benefit from a rights issue last year, the remaining cash-in-hand
should enable it to maintain an uncovered dividend. It might even gain some
praise for its tight control of cash on the contracting side.
Waterford Wedgwood, the crystal and ceramics group, is expected to post a
full-year pre-tax loss of IPounds 2m on Tuesday. Brokers anticipate an
IPounds 3m tax charge on profits in the ceramics division, making a post-tax
loss of IPounds 5m and earnings per share of around 0.6p.
Queens Moat Houses, the hotel group, is expected to report full-year pre-tax
profits on Wednesday of Pounds 92m, only slightly down on last year's Pounds
94m. The performance of its UK hotels will be watched with interest, as will
any sign of a slow-down in Germany.

FT  04 APR 92 / International Company News: Roche to raise payout as
earnings jump by 56%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ZURICH
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ROCHE surpassed Ciba-Geigy last year to become the largest of the big three
Swiss chemical and pharmaceutical groups in terms of net profit.
Roche yesterday reported a 56 per cent jump in consolidated net income in
1991 to SFr1.5bn (Dollars 995m), comfortably surpassing the SFr1.28bn
revealed last week by Ciba. Net income of Sandoz, the third largest, was
SFr1.1bn.
Ciba remains by far the largest of the three in terms of sales, with
turnover last year of SFr21bn, compared with Sandoz's SFr13.4bn and Roche's
SFr11.5bn.
Roche described its profit last year as 'a very good result' and proposed
raising the dividend by one third to SFr28 per share or dividend right
certificate. The profit was well above analysts' expectations, but
indications were that a large part came from non-operating items, notably
exchange rate movements.
Roche said that 'the continued healthy development in the non-operating
sector has also been a major contribution to the very good result'.
The relative weakness of the Swiss franc was another contributing factor, it
added.
The group said profits in its operating business improved in spite of a
considerable increase in spending on introducing new products, and
substantial restructuring costs.
Mr Nigel Spence of Baring Securities said the growth of profits from
operations was probably higher than the 18.4 per cent growth in sales.
The group's dividend right certificates (genusschein) rose SFr40 yesterday
to SFr3,120.
Roche said its cash flow rose 41 per cent to SFr2.26bn and capital spending
was up 26 per cent to SFr1.1bn, with much of it directed at projects in the
US and Switzerland.

FT  04 APR 92 / How To Spend It: Why lean times stretch ahead - Lucia van
der Post has been delving in the depths of her wardrobe for skirts which fit
the latest fashion diktat
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCIA VAN DER POST
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
I KNOW, I KNOW . . . you have just got a nice little collection of sexy,
snappy suits together. There they are, in different colours, the sassy,
curvy jacket, the short Lycra skirt, the wardrobe of toning tights, the flat
pumps. You feel good in them, you look good in them. And what does Paris do?
It produces one of the strongest most directional collection of shows for
years. The message it sends loud and clear is that the silhouette has
changed. Short and sassy is for yesteryear. Long, narrow, simple and strict
is what the new look is all about. Sometimes Paris speaks and nobody takes a
blind bit of notice. This time Paris has spoken and the fashion set has
listened.
Two weeks ago, it seems, came the big divide. Sharply-turned-out women left
their offices on Friday evening in their tights or leggings, their short
skirts and their little jackets. By Monday half of them were toffed out in
long narrow skirts, shops were pushing their short skirts to the back rails
and highlighting their windows with the longer, leaner silhouette.
In Paris these things are, of course, matters of deep import. It is not
enough to wear the things, they have to be discussed, VERY SERIOUSLY, as
well. Pundits on television have been heard muttering: 'Le mini c'est
termine' or 'une chose c'est certaine, le mini est absolument abandonne'.
The news need not be as depressing as it sounds. Anybody who has any nous
knows by now that you do not throw out all your old clothes when fashions
change. You get them cleaned and you pack them neatly away for when the
pendulum swings back. Most of us have in our wardrobes several long skirts
from last time around so stifle any inclination to rush and buy until you
check out the clothes you have.
Possibly your first buy should be a long jacket or narrow sleeveless
waistcoat to team with an existing skirt, because the silhouette does
require a longer, leaner top than the sassy jacket. Almost all the snappy
chain-stores have them - I have seen inexpensive versions in Hennes, Oasis,
Next and Warehouse while they come beautifully cut, very classy and more
expensive from Whistles and MaxMara.
Lucille Lewin, whose sharp eye and intuition for the way the fashion wind is
blowing is behind the Whistles chain of shops, thinks the arrival of the
long skirt is one of the best things to have happened to fashion in a long
time.
She says: 'We're very excited about the long skirt. It has completely
resuscitated the fashion business. We've been selling them since just before
Christmas and customers seem to love the new look.
'The skirts can be worn lots of ways - with a knotted shirt at the front,
with a body or a lean, long-line waistcoat or jacket or with the soft,
floaty little shorts underneath that are a very strong look this spring. The
long skirts can either be sarong-style or 1950s-style buttoned-up the front
(for a lady-like, feminine but sexy look, leave a couple of buttons at the
bottom undone).'
It also, I am afraid, means different shoes - either high heels or
mini-boots or the coming fashion for - yes, I'm sorry, but it's true -
platform soles.
In fashion and PR offices up and down the country the young are more excited
about long skirts than they have been about anything for a long time.
They are either rushing to buy the inexpensive versions that are already
beginning to arrive in chains like Oasis (a good sarong-style for Pounds
21.50), Next (a particularly elegant side-buttoning version in corn-coloured
linen for Pounds 44.99) and Miss Selfridge or else the prudent ones, who
never throw anything away, are digging out their long skirts from several
years back.
New in the shops though are long slender dresses (like the one from Whistles
sketched here) and the very soft shorts, almost like French knickers.
For those who do not fancy wearing long skirts - they are undoubtedly less
practical and harder to rush around in than the short skirt has been -
trousers are the obvious alternative and were in ample evidence at all the
Paris shows.
If you are at all worried as to how the new proportions will suit you find a
really good assistant in a shop you trust (the Whistles branch at 12 St
Christopher's Place, London W1 has some particularly good ones). Take your
time and experiment.
You will find that there is always a way of adapting a current look to suit
almost any shape and size.
In the meantime do not throw away your short skirts. Take a leaf out of
Lucille Lewin's notebook. 'It's not the time to be throwing anything away. I
still wear my short skirts sometimes, I just wear them in a much more
graphic way, teaming them with long sweaters so that just a little bit of
skirt peeps out from underneath.'

FT  04 APR 92 / Heron discloses pounds 100m losses: Property group outlines
plans for rescheduling debt payments
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX and ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HERON International yesterday announced operating losses of Pounds 100m for
the year to March 1992 - the first time in its 27-year history that Mr
Gerald Ronson's private international property group has incurred losses.
The disclosure came when Heron asked 80 banks and some representatives of
bondholders to reschedule payments on Pounds 950m of its Pounds 1.35bn of
bank debt and bonds.
Bankers predicted that many lenders would reject the rescheduling terms,
although they praised the 'quality' of Heron's presentation on the proposed
reconstruction.
One bank said bondholders would find it difficult to accept the terms
because they were not being offered any 'sweeteners'. Another banker said
there would be arguments about Heron's proposal that lenders to its UK
subsidiary, Heron Corporation - which has Pounds 400m of debt - would not be
asked to reschedule repayment of principal. Heron insists there is no
question of rescheduling this debt because Heron Corp has substantial net
worth.
Under the proposal, Pounds 950m of bank and bond debt would be divided into
two categories, 'A' and 'B'. Interest on the A debt would continue to be
paid and the principal repaid from cash generated by the ongoing businesses
and asset disposals. The B debt would have interest rolled up and would be
repaid once the principal on the A debt was paid. Much of Heron's principal
payments would thus be rescheduled to the late 1990s.
Holders of Pounds 450m of Eurobonds are being asked to convert 60 per cent
of their principal into A bonds and the rest into B bonds.
At the 90-minute presentation, Mr Ronson said accounts for the year to March
31 would show net assets had fallen to around Pounds 135m, compared with
Pounds 585m at March 1991. The bankers, chaired by Barclays which is owed
around Pounds 125m, then discussed the plan. Other members of the banks'
steering committee are Royal Bank of Canada, National Westminster Bank,
Manufacturers Hanover, the US bank soon to merge with Chemical Bank, and
Bank of America.
The collapse in Heron's net asset figure will put it in breach of its
banking covenants when the accounts are audited, so Heron is being forced to
renegotiate the terms of its loans. However it insists that it has enough
cash to meet its obligations until the end of 1993.
Heron is not seeking any new borrowings. The entire investment property
portfolio of around Pounds 1bn will be sold over the next seven years.
There was a Pounds 250m reduction in the value of the property portfolio,
which includes Pounds 135m in write-offs on UK, French and Spanish
development, and Pounds 38m on housebuilding land. A significant contributor
to the decline in asset value was a Pounds 134m charge in respect of Pima, a
US savings and loans business.
The balance of the decline came from Pounds 100m of operating losses and
Pounds 100m in extraordinary charges and provisions for tax on property
disposals, costs of selling property, and anticipated costs of debt
renegotiation.

FT  04 APR 92 / Portugal applies to join ERM
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK BLUM and PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LISBON, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PORTUGAL made a surprise application to join the European Monetary System's
exchange rate mechanism yesterday, underscoring its commitment to
controlling inflation.
The escudo will join the ERM on Monday at a central rate against the D-Mark
of Esc87.6, assuming Portugal's application is accepted by a meeting today
of Community officials.
The move, which is unlikely to have any impact on sterling, will mean that
all 12 EC members, except Greece, have their currencies pegged to the D-Mark
within the ERM. The Portuguese currency, like those of Spain and Britain,
will be allowed to fluctuate in a wide, 6 per cent band. All other units
have a narrow, 2.25 per cent band.
The ERM is seen as a system for bringing down inflation by restricting
opportunities for currencies to lose value. Portugal intends to join the
mechanism at a relatively high central rate, signalling a desire to follow
tough monetary policies.
The decision was announced yesterday by Mr Anibal Cavaco Silva, the prime
minister, after a special cabinet meeting.
The escudo's central rate will be Esc180 against the European Currency Unit
(Ecu). A meeting today of the EC's monetary committee will review the
procedures for entry and set limits for the escudo's links with the other
currencies in the system.
The move was not expected until later this year or early in 1993 when
inflation - 10.2 per cent at the end of February on an annualised basis -
was expected to be substantially reduced.

FT  04 APR 92 / SIB defends soft-commission share trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CALLS FOR a ban on so-called 'soft commission' share trading were turned
down yesterday by the Securities and Investments Board, the City's chief
investment regulator, which issued its strongest statement in defence of the
practice.
Under soft commission arrangements, institutional investors promise to give
business to a particular broker. In return, the institutions receive
facilities that help them do their job, such as information services or
screens carrying market news and data. Critics say the arrangements prevent
investors from shopping round to get the best deal for clients each time
they trade.
The practice was criticised recently by Mr Peter Rawlins, chief executive of
the London Stock Exchange. He called on pension fund investment managers to
drop soft commissions. 'To the average man, if people want a service, they
should be prepared to pay visibly for it in a currency everyone
understands,' he added.
Yesterday, the SIB said it had noted calls to review its policy on soft
commissions or to ban the practice, but it had decided no change was
necessary.
'Soft commission arrangements provide a legitimate means for fund managers
to obtain specialist services,' the board said. 'The payment of commission
in return for an array of services in addition to execution, which benefit
the fund manager's clients, is a traditional feature of the marketplace.'
The board said that to prevent abuse it had developed a framework to define
the services that could be provided, to keep customers informed and to
ensure that 'transactions are carried out on terms no different from those
involving a traditional commission arrangement'.
Those regulatory arrangements should be given a chance to settle down, it
said, adding that trustees 'should be alert to the implications for fund
beneficiaries of such arrangements'.
The board also said it would take no action to limit the ability of
integrated investment houses to undertake soft commission business. It had
started a review of the subject, prompted by moves by some integrated houses
to cut soft commission rates to win business.

FT  04 APR 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow defies jobs data to post
modest gains
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
AFTER threatening in the morning to break below a key support level for the
Dow index, US stock markets defied disappointing employment news to end the
day with modest gains, writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
At the close the Dow was up 14.99 at 3,249.11, having been more than 20
points down at midday. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 staged a
similar turnaround, finishing up 1.06 at 401.56. The Nasdaq composite index
of over-the-counter stocks, however, fell 3.81 to 590.01. Turnover was 189m
shares.
The keenly awaited March employment report showed a 19,000 rise in non-farm
payrolls and a 34 per cent downward revision in the initially estimated
164,000 rise in February payrolls.
Although the civilian unemployment rate was unchanged at 7.3 per cent last
month, the data overall were a blow to hopes that the economic recovery was
well under way.
Disappointment at the jobs news unleashed immediate selling, and pushed the
Dow near to 3,200 at midday. The morning's declines created buying
opportunities, however, and the market rebounded in the afternoon with most
of the gains coming in the final hour.
The employment data were welcomed by the Treasury markets and in late
trading the benchmark 30-year government bond was up  7/16 at 101 7/16 ,
yielding 7.867 per cent, and the two-year note was up  7/32 at 100, yielding
5.363 per cent.
CMS Energy eased another Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 15 5/8 in turnover of 3.7m
shares after Michigan regulators rejected a proposal on how much the
company's consumer power unit should pay for electricity from a power
generation venture half-owned by CMS.
Broking stocks remained under pressure on fears that the recent boom in
stock and bond offerings was over.
Merrill Lynch fell Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 51, PaineWebber lost Dollars
7/8 to Dollars 19 1/8 and AG Edwards slipped Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 22 7/8
.
Canada
TORONTO stocks closed lower in moderate volume of 26.25m shares, the 300
composite index falling 10.43 to 3385.48.

FT  04 APR 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Escudo news enlivens market
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
PORTUGAL'S decision to enter the ERM on Monday and frenzied activity in
Finland enlivened an otherwise steady day on the foreign exchanges.
The announcement that the escudo would enter a 6 per cent fluctuation band
at a central rate of 180 escudos to the D-Mark took the markets by surprise
 -traders said they had expected Portugal to wait until the end of the year.
Mr Norman Lamont, the UK chancellor of the exchequer, said sterling's
central rate against the other currencies in the ERM would not be affected
by the escudo's entry but Mr Nigel Newman, senior economist at Barclays,
warned that if the escudo rose strongly within the system it could pressure
the lower limits of sterling in the long-run.
The dollar sank in late European trading as longed-for positive economic
data failed to materialise.
Traders said US jobs data for March confirmed market suspicions that the US
recovery was proving somewhat anaemic.
'The dollar needs a steady diet of good economic data as it just hasn't got
the interest rate attractions enjoyed by the D-Mark,' said Mr Julian Callow,
international economist at Chase Investment bank. The US unit closed in
London at DM1.6265.
Sterling got off to a wobbly start, picked up a little during the day, only
to sink below DM2.84 at the close.
Jitters began in the morning with rumours in the newspapers that some Middle
East countries were dumping the UK currency and pushing sterling towards a
crisis.
Mr David Coleman, Treasury adviser at the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce
described the morning's activities as 'crazy'.
'People were selling sterling this morning on the basis of a newspaper story
that said there was going to be a sterling crisis,' he said. The pound ended
the day at DM2.8350.
Turbulence hit the Finnish markets following the announcement by the Bank of
Finland's governor, Mr Rolf Kullberg, that he would retire at the end of
June.
Short-term interest rates soared and currency flooded out of the country.
One analyst reported rumours of a Pounds 10bn outflow of markkas. According
to one dealer, nervousness intensified after newspaper reports that some
academics were calling for a 25 per cent devaluation of the currency.
The appointment of Ms Sirkka Hamalainen as the new governor was judged to
have come too late to stop the feverish trading, although it was expected to
have a calming effect by Monday.
The markka ended the day less than half a per cent from its bottom limit
against the Ecu.

FT  04 APR 92 / International Company News: Tobishima agrees new debt plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TOBISHIMA Corporation, a leading Japanese contractor and developer, has
announced that a plan to reduce its Y1,000bn (Dollars 749.6m) in group debt
has failed, and that a new five-year scheme, including an indefinite cut in
interest rates, has been approved by its main bank, Fuji Bank.
The plight of Tobishima, once renowned for railway and power plant
construction, but now a victim of its speculative property developments,
highlights the importance of the main bank relationship in Japan. Its
debt-shuffling method of holding off collapse is common to other Japanese
companies facing stock and property losses.
Last June, Tobishima announced a three-year debt restructuring plan in which
it would offload property holdings, but the weak property market forced it
to shift assets and debts around group companies, with the result that total
debt has risen from Y930bn in March last year to Y1,000bn.
However, the new scheme, overseen by two former Fuji Bank executives, also
involves a significant amount of debt shuffling.
Most of the burden will be assumed by Nihon Kaiser, a concrete slab maker in
which Tobishima has a 19 per cent stake, and which is run by a nephew of Mr
Hitoshi Tobishima, the contractor's president.
Mr Tobishima, 79, resumed as president last year after having forced his
son, Akira, to resign. Akira had authorised a spate of US purchases and had
wanted to develop an international chain of five-star hotels.
Under the plan, Tobishima will transfer Y430bn of its debt to a subsidiary,
Tobishima Urban Development, giving it a total of Y790b in debt, and
reducing the parent's exposure to Y210bn. At the same time, ownership of
Tobishima Urban will be transferred to Nihon Kaiser.
Tobishima is also trying to distance itself from Tobishima Urban and the
large debt in an attempt to take pressure off its share price, which
yesterday fell Y71 to Y535. The fall followed news that construction orders
were sharply lower than expected, with sales in the year to end-March
forecast at Y460bn, down from a previous estimate of Y530bn.
The contractor said that Fuji Bank, which has a 4.8 per cent stake in
Tobishima, and about 80 other banks have agreed to reduce the interest on
its debt from about 6.5 per cent to 3 per cent this year, while Tobishima
Urban's interest rate is likely to be cut to 1 per cent, indefinitely.
The success of the plan depends on a recovery in the Japanese property
market, and Tobishima says the 1 per cent interest rate will be reviewed as
holdings are sold off. The company has sold its Tokyo headquarters, near the
Imperial Palace, but the buyer was another member of the same group.
For the fiscal year just ended, the company expects to report an after-tax
loss of Y45bn, including write-offs from the overhaul of a Japanese and a US
subsidiary, and Y13.3bn in losses from a Los Angeles building project.
Pre-tax profit is estimated at Y1bn, down from a forecast of Y5bn.

FT  04 APR 92 / International Company News: Court winds up La Cinq TV
channel
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
LA CINQ yesterday made broadcasting history by becoming the first national
French television channel to close after it was declared bankrupt by the
Paris commercial court.
The court's decision followed months of desperate attempts to salvage La
Cinq, which went under with almost FFr4bn (Dollars 717.5m) of liabilities
and had been blighted by financial problems since its launch in 1986.
The station experienced several changes of ownership in its short life
having started under Mr Jerome Seydoux, the industrialist and confidant of
President Francois Mitterand.
Mr Seydoux was ousted after Mr Jacques Chirac's conservative government took
power in favour of Mr Robert Hersant, the right wing press baron who, in
turn, sold out to the Hachette media group in autumn 1990.
None of La Cinq's owners managed to get to grips with the channel. For a
brief period in the late 1980s it was applauded for its current affairs
coverage, but then dived downmarket in an attempt to challenge the light
entertainment format favoured by TF1, the biggest French TV station.
La Cinq has since had the dubious distinction of being best known for its
late night soft pornography.
Its failure to attract a significant audience - its share of viewing fell
from 12.5 per cent in 1990 to 11 per cent last year - made it difficult to
generate advertising revenue.
When Hachette took control in autumn 1990, the channel had lost almost
FFr2.5bn. Its losses have since escalated reaching more than FFr1.1bn in
1991 alone. On new year's eve Hachette, having tried, and failed, to find
new investors, announced that La Cinq was filing for bankruptcy.
The French authorities have since attempted to find a suitable rescuer. At
one point it looked as though Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the Italian media mogul,
would be able to put together a FFr1.5bn refinancing package. But he failed
to secure enough financial support to implement his plan.
La Cinq's closure has left its 600 staff without jobs and will involve
significant losses for its shareholders, which include the banks Credit
Lyonnais of France and Kleinwort Benson of the UK, as well as Hachette and
Mr Berlusconi.
Hachette has already totted up its losses. It is still in negotiations over
possible compensation for the financial investors it introduced to La Cinq,
including Kleinwort.
But earlier this week it announced it would be making a provision of
FFr1.8bn for La Cinq in its 1991 accounts, bringing its total losses on
France's ill-fated fifth channel to FFr3.5bn.

FT  04 APR 92 / International Company News: Madrid gives green light to
Repsol bond
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER BRUCE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE SPANISH government has given the green light for a convertible bond
offering worth between Pta25bn (Dollars 240m) and Pta50bn in Repsol, its
oil, gas and chemicals group. Company officials said the offering would be
made in Spain, to small shareholders, next month.
At yesterday's share prices the maximum offering of Pta50bn would cut the
state's stake in Repsol by 5.9 per cent, to 60.6 per cent, although the
Cabinet yesterday authorised a limit of 8.33 per cent in any reduction of
the state's holding.
Company officials said at least Pta25bn in three-year convertible bonds
would be offered next month, but the full Pta50bn could be tapped if the
market proved enthusiastic. In 1989, the state sold off 26.5 per cent of
Repsol, to raise Dollars 1.3bn in the country's largest flotation. It is
highly likely that after the summer, the government will make another large
convertible bond issue, this time to institutions in Spain and abroad.
It is possible that this issue could reduce the state's stake in Repsol to
below 50 per cent. For that to happen, though, parliament needs to revoke or
change a law which forces the state to control at least 50 per cent of
Campsa, the monopoly fuel distributor in Spain.
This control is exercised through Repsol, which has more than 65 per cent of
Campsa.
Parliament is expected to pass new legislation before the summer recess.
Given the state of the world's stock markets, Repsol is being much more
cautious about the second round of privatisation. Late last year an
international stock placement was being projected.
In fact, while Madrid has decided to press carefully ahead with Repsol, it
has shelved plans to float about 20 per cent of Banco Exterior, its large
commercial bank, and is no longer thinking of a further placement of stock
in Endesa, its profitable electricity utility.

plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EMS-CHEMIE, the Swiss speciality chemicals group, has found a novel way of
making a large distribution to shareholders without, it hopes, exposing them
to tax.
The group intends to pay back to shareholders part of the nominal value of
their shares. As this would represent neither a capital gain nor a dividend,
EMS is confident that it will be free of tax.
The move is part of a restructuring of capital that EMS, like many Swiss
companies, is proposing this year to take advantage of impending changes in
Swiss company law.
Under the EMS plan, holders of the SFr500 nominal bearer shares will receive
SFr200 per share. Then the shares will be split three-for-one, reducing
their nominal value to SFr100.
There is a similar scheme for the SFr100 registered shares.
The distributions would cost the group the equivalent of 57 per cent of its
SFr99m net income last year.

<TEXT>
MR Paul Reichmann, co-owner and chief strategist of Olympia &amp; York, the
financially-strapped property developer, has quietly resigned from the board
of Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, the company's main banker and largest
creditor.
An official spokesman for CIBC, Canada's second biggest financial
institution, had no comment yesterday on Mr Reichmann's position. But
another source said Mr Reichmann submitted his resignation several months
ago, before a liquidity crisis forced O&amp;Y to ask its creditors to
restructure its USDollars 20bn debt.
Canadian banks traditionally invite representatives of their most valued
customers to sit on their boards. CIBC has refused to comment in any way on
its relationship with O&amp;Y. But Canadian banking analysts have estimated
CIBC's exposure at about CDollars 1bn.
CIBC, meanwhile, has named Mr Al Flood as its next chairman and chief
executive.
Mr Flood, aged 56 and head of CIBC's corporate banking unit, will succeed Mr
Donald Fullerton who is retiring after seven years in the top job. The
appointment takes effect on June 7.
Mr Flood has had responsibility for the bank's negotiations with O&amp;Y. He is
unlikely to make any large changes in the short-term, beyond overseeing an
expansion into insurance and fiduciary services when regulatory barriers are
lifted on June 1.

<TEXT>
MR Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation has joined forces with
Tele-Communications, the largest cable television operator in the US, to buy
majority control of Reiss Media, one of the biggest US pay-per-view
television distribution and programming companies.
The deal represents a diversification into pay-per-view for News Corp, which
already controls the Twentieth Century Fox film studio and the Fox network
of television stations.
Mr David DeVoe, chief financial officer of News Corp, said the relationship
with Reiss first began in the mid 1980s when Fox was involved in the
development of Request Television, a pay-per-view network.
Financial terms of the the Reiss deal were not disclosed, but it is
understood that News and TCI will jointly pay more than Dollars 25m to own
equal equity stakes totalling two thirds of the unquoted company.
The Reiss shares are being bought by News and TCI from a group of investors
including Warburg, Pincus, the investment firm.
The complex deal features the simultaneous purchase by Reiss of a 50 per
cent stake in Request Television and Request 2, two pay-per-view networks.
Reiss, which will have 100 per cent of the networks following the purchase,
is buying back the 50 per cent it originally sold in 1989 to Group W
Satellite Communications, a division of Westinghouse Broadcasting.

FT  04 APR 92 / UK Company News: Criticism between Polly Peck administrators
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BARCHARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TWO administrators of Polly Peck International have publicly distanced
themselves from the third, in the latest twist in the story of Mr Asil
Nadir's electronics, fruit and leisure company.
But criticism of Mr Christopher Morris of Touche Ross by his fellow
insolvency practitioners, Mr Richard Stone of Coopers &amp; Lybrand Deloitte and
Mr Michael Jordan of Cork Gully appears to have been intended to placate
Turkish Cypriot sensitivities in the hope of unlocking Polly Peck records
and funds in Cyprus.
At a press conference on Thursday journalists were handed a press release,
prepared by leading counsel, in which Mr Stone and Mr Jordan said a recent
unsuccessful action by Mr Morris in the High Court in London against the
Turkish Cypriot central bank was his sole responsibility. Statements and
allegations by Mr Morris should not be attributed to them.
They said they especially particularly regretted the fact that Mr Morris had
described the Turkish army's intervention in Cyprus in 1974 as an invasion.
The three administrators and the committee of Polly Peck creditors approved
the contents of the statement earlier this week.
Along with their comments on Mr Morris, the two administrators said they had
regained control of two Polly Peck hotels in northern Cyprus, Jasmine Court
and Palm Beach, and had appointed Execumaster Hotels, an international hotel
management group, to run them.

JAMES WILKES last night successfully escaped the clutches of rival
engineering group Petrocon after the Takeover Panel rejected an appeal to
have the Pounds 35m bid extended, writes Richard Gourlay.
The panel found that new information given to only certain Wilkes
shareholders was not material in the context of the offer. The bid should
therefore lapse.
The bid closed on Monday but Petrocon and Robert Fleming, its adviser,
appealed first to the executive committee and then to the full Panel.
Edinburgh Fund Managers, one of the shareholders, which received new
information decided on March 27 not to support Petrocon. It had been among
shareholders which had supported the Petrocon bid in an unusual public
letter.
The new information concerned statements by Mr Arthur Watts, Wilkes
chairman, and Rowe Pitman, the brokers, that two executive directors would
'probably leave within the next few months'.
Mr Oliver Ellingham, a director of Robert Fleming, said: 'We considered that
the departure of the finance director and one other director, comprising one
third of the board was important information for shareholders.'
Despite rejecting the appeal, the Panel reinforced the rule that no new
information and no new significant opinions should be aired to selected
shareholders during the course of a bid.

FT  04 APR 92 / UK Company News: Leading UK and European institutions to
shun WMI
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW FREEMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SEVERAL LEADING UK and European institutions have decided to shun the Pounds
465m flotation of Waste Management International (WMI) which enters its last
lap next week.
Despite heavy pressure from Cazenove and Merrill Lynch, brokers and lead
underwriter respectively, the institutions say they will avoid the
international offer and placing of 20 per cent of the shares in WMI, the
overseas arm of Waste Management Inc, the US waste disposal company.
However, demand from the US is expected to be strong enough to allow the
flotation to be successfully completed.
The UK institutions are worried about the high indicated price of the shares
and the ambitious growth assumptions made for WMI in the issue prospectus.
The shares are due to be priced in the US on Monday night, before
preliminary dealings begin on Tuesday. UK fund managers said yesterday the
price for the UK placing was likely to be around 620p, against an indicated
range of 530-645p. That would value the whole of WMI at Pounds 2.3bn and put
the shares on a multiple of 34 times the pro-forma 1991 earnings per share.
US investors are reportedly keen to switch into the fast-growing overseas
subsidiary of the US parent.

FT  04 APR 92 / UK Company News: Young to lose USM quote in survival plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR BOB YOUNG, founder of the Young Group, the coalmining company, is to step
down as chairman as part of a survival package which also involves the loss
of its USM quotation. He will remain as chief executive.
The package includes a Pounds 2.4m additional overdraft facility to meet
working capital requirements.
The company, which has sites in the UK and Venezuela, also announced pre-tax
profits of Pounds 245,000 in the year to November 30 1991, against a
restated loss of Pounds 89,000 for the 1990 year. Turnover was Pounds 41.5m
(Pounds 36.9m) with earnings per share of 2.98p (0.2p). The board proposes
passing the final dividend making a total of 2.6p (5.2p).
Shortfalls in reserves on some opencast sites resulted in exceptional
provisions of Pounds 485,000 against future losses. And output from
Venezuela was below expectations due to equipment problems.
Young Group began negotiations on the package after it announced on March 3
an unexpected fall in profits and increased working capital requirements.
The company said it had not been possible to refinance on conventional
terms. The major shareholders had offered immediate finance on terms which
did not comply with Stock Exchange rules, obliging the cancellation of the
USM quotation.
If the proposals are accepted the shares would be traded under Rule 535(2).
The shares, suspended on Wednesday, resumed yesterday closing at 4p, against
the 35p suspension price.
The Group's bankers are to receive as security for 50 per cent of the
additional facility a cash deposit of Pounds 1.2m from the major
shareholders and directors. Warrants will be issued in consideration of the
additional facilities, an adjustment made to the conversion rights of the
convertible preference shares and a free issue of warrants made to all other
ordinary shareholders.
If fully implemented, Mr Bob Young's holding would be much reduced to 15.9
per cent while the largest shareholders will be BIL Securities (Far East)
and 3i Group with 39.2 per cent and 22.1 per cent.

FT  04 APR 92 / UK Company News: Board resigns as Steetley more than halved
to Pounds 34m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STEETLEY, the building materials group taken over last month by Redland,
yesterday reported profits for the year to December 31 more than halved, in
line with the estimate made in its unsuccessful defence document.
The Rugby-based company announced pre-tax profits down from Pounds 85.2m to
Pounds 34.1m, on sales 6 per cent lower at Pounds 724.3m.
Earnings per share tumbled from 34.8p to 14.2p. Steetley holders accepting
Redland shares through the bid will receive the 16.75p Redland final
dividend announced on Thursday; this is equivalent to 14.57p per Steetley
share, it was stated.
Those taking the cash alternative will receive no dividend.
Following the successful bid, the Steetley board resigned yesterday to make
way for the Redland team.
Mr Gordon Stanley, who was in charge of the industrial product and services
division, will remain in an executive capacity.
The interest charge rose from Pounds 20.5m to Pounds 26.3m on debt that
ended the year at Pounds 222m, giving gearing of 67 per cent.
There was an extraordinary charge of Pounds 17m, about half of which related
to bid defence costs.
Operating profits on the quarry products side fell from Pounds 70.7m to
Pounds 43.3m while in the bricks, tiles and concrete products division they
dropped from Pounds 21.7m to Pounds 7.1m.
Geographically, profits in the UK fell most heavily, from Pounds 51m to
Pounds 19.5m, while those in North America were halved to Pounds 7.2m.

FT  04 APR 92 / Long day's journey to the right: Neil Kinnock, the Labour
leader, has come of age
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It was not quite JFK's Camelot. But the 250-odd guests who gathered for Neil
and Glenys Kinnock's 25th wedding anniversary in the Inner Temple's
Parliament Chamber 10 days ago owed something to a mediaeval court.
Dotted among the Parrys and Howells from Wales were a smattering of shadow
Cabinet members, courtiers from the leader's Commons bunker, Mr Gavyn
Davies, the City economist, the discreet presence of favoured trade
unionists and, of course, familiar friends from showbiz - John Mortimer,
Anthony Sher and Stephen Fry among them.
At the centre of this babbling throng, the happy couple presided with
magisterial self-assurance: Neil, foot-tapping to a live performance by Cleo
Laine, as Glenys chatted nearby with a relative.
With election day just three weeks away, the party's aim - anniversary
celebrations aside - was to show the world that, mid-campaign, the Labour
leader was in command, relaxed and confident.
'It don't mean a thing, if it ain't got that swing,' trilled Cleo. And, sure
enough, less than a week later, the polls swung accordingly.
If Labour loses the election, the Kinnocks' party will probably rank among
the highest points of their lives. After 25 years of hard politics, it was a
triumphant confirmation of Labour's return to its rightful place as
Britain's alternative establishment and a public acknowledgement of the
Kinnocks' central part in the process.
No wonder then that the host's ebullient self-confidence was the overriding
impression of the evening. Yet with only days to the election to go, Mr
Kinnock's personality remains at the very centre of the British political
plot.
Is he a Moses, destined to lead the party to the promised land, but doomed
never to enter it? Or might he be a bluff Prince Hal, a boisterous
rabble-rouser set to be transformed, like a political Henry V, into a safe
pair of hands?
If there is any single quality that is repeated time and again in the
reminiscences of friends and acquaintances of the man now on the doorstep of
Downing Street, it is his extraordinary lack of self-doubt.
Even though, on occasions, Mr Kinnock's private insecurities show through,
for some onlookers it is this conviction in his own capability that is
indigestibly strong meat.
One Scots MP, a self-proclaimed Kinnockite, commented recently that while he
applauded all his leader's achievements, he would never be able to empathise
with the man himself. 'It is the 'boyo' side of him I just can't stand. He
is just not my kind of person,' he commented.
Much of the Conservatives' campaign has been based on the premise that the
public share the same feeling. When Mr Kinnock's virtues are discussed - his
persistence, his courage in tackling Militant, his achievement in bringing
Labour so close to power - his Tory critics counter that swallowed
principles, inverted policies and an opportunism, forged by ambition alone,
render him unfit to be prime minister.
Such charges, enraged Kinnock loyalists insist, are merely a distorted
fiction of the tabloid press and a wilful misrepresentation of a courageous
and talented man.
The truth, perhaps, is more simple than both cartoon images. So entwined is
the Labour leader's political journey with the party's own decade-long
metamorphosis that it is hard to disentangle the two. For The Sunday Times
the Kinnock story is headlined The Flight from Conviction, but it could be
called The Road Back to Reality.
Even before he won the leadership election almost nine years ago, Mr Kinnock
is said to have confessed privately that he had some reluctance in taking up
the challenge. With his ideas still half-formed, his natural rebelliousness
unprepared for the straightjacket of responsibility, his immaturity often
showed.
'It has always been Neil's misfortune,' as one sympathiser put it recently,
'that he has had to do his growing up in public'. So it has been with
Labour.
Almost from his infancy, the young Neil Kinnock's natural effervescence drew
attention. Born 50 years ago into a mining family in Tredegar - the
constituency of the Labour hero, Aneurin Bevan - he was the only child of a
happy marriage between Gordon Kinnock, a gently-mannered miner, and Mary
Parry, a formidable and intelligent district nurse.
Nurtured by devoted parents in the extended family of a Welsh mining
community - the Coldstream Guards of the Labour movement - the young Neil
was swaddled in security, a cheerful boy, with a cheeky talent for mimicry.
Though the family was not well off, Nurse Kinnock's maternal ambitions and
critical tongue saw her son hurdle the greatest obstacle to working-class
success, the 11-plus exam. In consequence, and much to his irritation, he
was sent to Lewis School, Pengam - a single-sex establishment considered the
Eton of the Valleys.
In his campaign plane last week, Mr Kinnock recalled his and his friends'
loathing for the place. 'We didn't do a stroke,' he said, with mild
amusement. 'But because we had got through the 11-plus we were all convinced
we had made it.'
Already politics, thick in the Welsh air, had permeated his life. He first
saw Bevan speak aged 10, read his treatise, In Place of Fear, at 14 and
joined the Labour party a year later. Unhappiness at school and three 'O'
levels persuaded him to seek work in the pits, but his mother would not have
it. He went on to pass well in three 'A' Levels to become the first in 'a
thousand generations of Kinnocks' to take a place at university.
Much scorn has been poured on Mr Kinnock's pass degree at Cardiff but his
lack of academic distinction owed mostly to the heady atmosphere of
university life - an exuberant combination of rugby, politics and
socialising.
It was here that he first met his wife-to-be while handing out leaflets in a
cafeteria queue. It was to impress 'Glen' that the young tyro first took to
the rostrum in speeches to up to 700 fellow students. Lord Callaghan, then a
Cardiff MP, was just one of many listeners astonished by the impact of the
young debater.
Other Kinnockian qualities also emerged at this time, not least a certain
vanity and priggishness. He was fiercely conservative in his clothes - white
shirts and highly polished shoes - and curiously illiberal for the
permissive 1960s. His friend Mr Rhodri Morgan, now MP for Callaghan's seat,
remembers how Neil pressed the landlord of The Old Arcade pub to eject the
local hippies, suspecting they were selling dope.
Although a left-winger, Mr Kinnock also kept within reach of the mainstream.
One of his first political collaborations with Glenys was to organise the
ousting of an extreme left clique from the leadership of the Labour club.
From the presidency of the Cardiff students' union on, the young Kinnock
maximised his contacts in the unions and industry by lecturing for the
Workers' Educational Association. A fierce opponent of Barbara Castle's In
Place of Strife union reform proposals, he entered parliament in 1970 as the
Heath government began its own wrestling match with organised labour.
Aged just 28, the MP for Bedwellty's politics fused the lessons of his
half-digested industrial relations course and the more fashionable verities
of the National Union of Students. But his passion was rooted in the class
solidarity that permeated the mines and factories of the Valleys.
Rapidly establishing a reputation as a powerful, fluent (if verbose)
speaker, the young firebrand was soon making frequent visits to constituency
parties across the country.
On most issues, he sat comfortably with left-wing orthodoxy, though, even
then, his arguments were often based not on ideology but in practical or
party political terms. On the European Community, for example, Mr Kinnock's
opposition to British membership was less that the EC was a 'capitalist
club' and more that the hated Tories' favoured it.
On devolution for Scotland and Wales, however, he took a more marxist
stance, arguing at the risk of hostility from his constituents that the
working-class gained nothing from a Welsh assembly. 'We have not,' he
ironically told the 1976 party conference, 'had one riot in Ebbw Vale for
lack of direct elections to the Welsh Tourist Board.'
A year earlier during the sterling crisis of 1975, Mr Kinnock had sided
dogmatically with the left, joining 37 Labour rebels to vote down the Wilson
government's package of public expenditure cuts. The minutes of Bedwellty
party record that their MP argued 'it was not the task of Labour to salvage
and re-establish capitalism'.
When a year later his early mentor, Mr Callaghan, complimented his powerful
speaking abilities by offering him a junior ministerial post, he turned it
down, calculating that the price of silence, under the convention of
collective responsibility, was not worth paying.
So far, so radical. But in the wake of the 1979 election defeat, amid the
devastation of the Winter of Discontent, Mr Kinnock's change began.
Well before Labour's civil war began in earnest, the young MP had naturally
sided with the grassroots activists. As early as 1973 he had helped found
the Campaign for Labour Party Democracy, later to become the banner of the
Bennite opposition against the parliamentary establishment.
Furthermore, he had publicly opposed the 5 per cent pay norm that had
triggered the conflict with the unions. Yet when parliament returned, the
rebel decided to use the period in opposition to climb. Just as Mr Tony Benn
decided not to stand in the shadow cabinet elections in order to fight for
internal changes in the party, Mr Kinnock opted to try, arguing instead: 'It
was put up or shut up time.'
In interviews since he has suggested that his motive was intended to push
for a left-wing programme from the vanguard not to carp from backbenches.
'It was no good wingeing on . . . it was time to influence affairs.'
That appears to be borne out by his statement at the time that priva tised
industries should be renationalised without compensation to shareholders.
But to his allies on the hard left, Mr Kinnock's decision to accept an
appointed frontbench post as education spokesman had, as Mr Benn records in
his diaries, 'totally' undermined the left's argument for democratic change.
But the key break did not come until the following year when Mr Benn
launched his 1980 challenge to Mr Denis Healey for the deputy leadership. In
an outspoken article for the Tribune newspaper, Mr Kinnock went on the
offensive. Accusing the Benn manifesto's pledge of full employment within a
lifetime of a parliament as 'a reckless simplicity', he said the darling of
the radicals has 'significantly harmed the current standing and electoral
opportunities of the Labour party'.
It was the first important act of genuine political courage of his career.
It signalled the end of Mr Kinnock's period of posturing and a new
seriousness that was to put electoral considerations repeatedly ahead of
ideology on his list of political priorities.
Even before his election to the party leadership Kinnock had recognised that
the growth of the Social Democratic party, demanded urgent action. He was
shifting ground on Europe, believing withdrawal from the community was now
no more than a fantasy. And a mounting suspicion of middle-class elitism
within the Bennite-left began to colour his criticism.
'They are willing to condemn millions of people to unemployment, bad
housing, deficiencies in education, bad health provision,' he wrote in a
vituperative article in the Morning Star, 'they surrender the right to call
themselves socialists since they are ready to fight to the last drop of
someone else's blood.'
Such sentiments added both to Mr Kinnock's enemies and his growing authority
as a left-wing voice of reason. Furthermore, the shift in tone was as
perfectly timed as the delivery of his speeches. When the Foot leadership
collapsed in the ashes of the 1983 election defeat, the party judged that it
was only the 41-year-old Mr Kinnock who could heal the left-right schism.
In his acceptance speech, the young leader quoted extensively from Bevan's
admonition against politicians speaking in 'old false categories . . . that
echo the past', urging them instead to 'speak with the authentic accents of
those who elected them'.
Mr Kinnock added: 'We have to commend the common sense of socialism, the
realism of socialism . . . the most rational, reasonable, emancipating creed
ever put on the agenda of mankind.'
Armed with those words, his leadership has marched steadily down the
revisionist path. But while the red rose revamp of the party's image
proceeded, progress was at first little more than decorative. It was his
attack on the Militant tendency at the 1985 Bournemouth conference that
finally underlined the deadly seriousness of Mr Kinnock's determination to
see Labour back in office.
But it was only in the wake of the 1987 election defeat, that his zeal
spread across the party clearing the path for the root and branch policy
review that eventually jettisoned unilateralism, embraced Europe
wholeheartedly and reclothed Labour in social democratic colours.
For Mr Kinnock himself the process of change has often been painful. Friends
have noted that his natural cheerfulness has diminished. Colleagues remark
sympathetically on the loneliness of a job which has seen him transformed
from a darling of the media to its prime target.
Ms Clare Short, a member of labour's National Executive Committee who has
twice resigned from his front-bench team, still expresses a motherly
affection for him.
Yet the more rabid Tory tabloids aside, how unfair has the press really
been? Has Mr Kinnock not taken U-turns on almost all the key issues of the
day - Europe, nuclear weapons, devolution - to name but three?
The truth is that in reforming the party Mr Kinnock reformed his own ideas
too, turning cautious pragmatism into his new ideology. As policy-changes
have seen Labour rise in the opinion polls from the 27 points of 1983 to the
potentially election-winning 40s, the leader feels vindicated in his belief
that the party's policies are ideologically sound - socialist even - if they
fairly reflect ordinary people's beliefs and ideas.
On that ground alone, unilateralism could be jettisoned - a decision that is
said by intimates to have caused neither Neil nor Glenys any profound pain.
The same argument underpins his lack of interest in electoral and
constitutional reform.
Privately, Mr Kinnock retains a deep scepticism about devolution, though he
will go along with it in order to halt a Scots rebellion. On such issues as
devaluation and budgetary prudence, he is dogmatically austere - convinced
that quick fixes for the economy are no substitute for old-fashioned hard
graft.
Indeed, he is now a genuinely enthusiastic European, admiring its commitment
to industry and training. The Exchange Rate Mechanism and the Maastricht
convergence terms for a single currency, he believes, will prove useful
shields against an explosion of unrealistic pay claims from the unions.
When attacked for these policy shifts, Mr Kinnock says that his changes
reflect a changed world, but retain in their ideals of redistribution and
social welfare a clear continuity with Bevanite ideas.
His goals, set out in his 1991 Brighton conference speech, were to enable
people to get the best out of life and control their own destinies. By
contrast, 'British Toryism is above all about letting the future look after
itself, about letting people fend for themselves whether they are able or
not.'
Where then does all this leave his fitness to govern? To this, Mr Kinnock's
understandable response is to point to his success in remodelling Labour
into the most unified and disciplined shape ever achieved in its long
history.
His campaign has shown him better able than ever before at handling the
rigours of the television interview and publicly sifting the minutiae of
policy. Yet it is Mr Kinnock's personality that continues to provoke unease.
His Tuscan holidays, his obvious delight in theatre and music, his fondness
for the well-chosen word show an unashamed pride in middle-class tastes. But
now and then there comes a shock. It may be the flash of temper that
recently ruined a Commons' speech when he called a respected backbencher 'a
jerk'.
Perhaps, most of all, it is that demagogic platform style - all sweeping
hand gestures and grandiose oratory - which this week dismissed Toryism, in
the language of a fiery chapel preacher, as 'a sin, a sin, a sin'.
The Kinnock toughness - the bullheaded stubbornness - has got him where he
wants. It may well prove an asset if he is forced to bang heads round
Downing Street's cabinet room table.
But far from being dangerous, Mr Kinnock's politics in their mature
middle-age are a reflection of the man: sturdily respectable, sentimentally
embedded in community and family, romantic even, and, perhaps, a little
dull.
Yet, every now and then, one has the sensation that - beneath the laughter
and the bonhommie - a deep hurt lingers. The champion of compassion has had
to learn the ways of the streetfighter: the fare for a journey from
jack-the-lad to national leader has been paid in full.

FT  04 APR 92 / Double visions of the UK economy: Britain's political
parties are still divided on markets and taxes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For Mr John Smith, it was a glimpse of a better future.
The shadow chancellor's eyes lit up as he watched 39-year-old Kathleen
Jennings operate her computer-controlled milling machine in the engineering
workshop at the Midland Oak Skills and Technology Centre in Brierley Hill
near Birmingham. 'Making goods and providing services that people round the
world want, that's what Britain should be about,' he said.
By contrast, chancellor Mr Norman Lamont's campaigning in the Birmingham
area the day before took him to a one-man cake business to emphasise the
government's support for individual enterprise.
Understandably for a country mired in recession, the election campaign at
the national level has focused on the main parties' respective claims to
manage the UK economy more successfully.
But the campaigning in the West Midlands neatly captured the fundamental
differences in attitude that exist between the main parties over individual
responsibility and the power of the state to control market forces in the
economy.
The possibility of a Labour government or a hung parliament makes this
election the most important for Britain's consumers and businesses since
1979. Overarching divergences on economic philosophy between the Tories on
the one hand and Labour and the Liberal Democrats on the other could result
in Britain having a very different economy if the government changes and if
the next parliament runs its full course.
In spite of a retreat from radicalism by both main parties, Labour retains a
belief that the state should influence how individual lives are arranged and
that society is best served by a distribution of wealth from 'rich' to
'poor'. The Conservatives, although they have expressed it poorly, want to
vest more responsibility in the individual and promote ownership, and are
more interested in the creation than allocation of wealth.
These differences have been exaggerated by the parties' regional biases. Mr
Neil Kinnock's new model Labour party is staffed by northerners and Scots
from the UK's lower-cost, lower-paid manufacturing regions. As a result, it
has little reason to sympathise with the conspicuous consumption of 'Essex
man' and his cousins in the south-east of England which was fostered during
the boom of the 1980s.
However, what really differentiates the parties is their attitude to the
market. The Conservatives work from the presumption that market mechanisms
and incentives should be allowed to do their job except in cases of manifest
market failure or where a service - the most obvious being defence - is
clearly for the public good. Both Labour and Liberal Democrats wish to
influence the market. The Liberal Democrats say that 'the market should be
our servant, not our master', while Labour claims that modern government has
a 'strategic role to ensure that the market works properly'.
Labour has therefore reserved the right to interfere in broad sectors of the
economy, usually with the aim of guiding and supporting producer interests.
The Tories, in spite of drifting under Mr John Major away from the more
rigorous free market precepts of Mrs Thatcher's governments, want the
consumer to be king and call the shots.
That Labour has no instinctive affinity for the market economy has been
demonstrated by politicians on the stump and in its policy papers. On an
election phone-in programme this week, Mr John Smith was
uncharacteristically lost for words when asked how he would resist the
temptation to alter interest rates on the grounds of political expediency. A
politician steeped in the laws of the market would have answered that in a
world of unhindered capital movements, such imprudent action would swiftly
be penalised by financial market pressures.
The Labour manifesto is full of interventionist pledges of varying merit. It
promises action to help industry as a top priority for lifting Britain out
of recession; 'an investment decade' and 'a coherent national training
policy' to rebuild the UK's manufacturing strength. It includes plans for a
minimum wage in spite of evidence from independent economic research
institutes that there are better ways to alleviate poverty. Labour would
also 'manage credit sensibly' and 'stop excessive price rises in water,
electricity, telephones, transport and National Health Service
prescriptions'.
The rival tax proposals of Mr Lamont and Mr Smith underline the two leading
parties' differing perceptions on incentives and how best to strengthen the
supply side of the economy. Mr Smith has never wavered in his belief that
Labour's plans to increase significantly the tax burden of people earning
more than Pounds 22,000 will have no effect on economic efficiency or that
his proposed Pounds 1.1bn recovery programme for industry will spur
investment and growth. Mr Lamont's theme since his March 10 Budget has been
that increases in top tax rates make no sense at this stage of the economic
cycle.
On the other hand, the length and depth of the Tories' second recession show
that market forces can be a cruel and crude taskmaster for a government that
fails to master the challenges of deregulation and liberalisation. Britain's
crumbling infrastructure and the lack of coherent government in London are
also examples of how too narrow a definition of the public good has allowed
problems to emerge that are damaging Britain's ability to be economically
competitive.
Despite their fundamental differences, no single party is likely to make
much difference to the key indicators of Britain's economic health over the
next five years. The scope for macroeconomic manoeuvre is limited. High
government borrowings restrict the room for fiscal stimulus. Britain's
ability to alter interest rates is constrained by sterling's membership of
the European exchange rate mechanism.
As the chart shows, James Capel, the London stockbroker, expects growth to
be solid rather than spectacular whichever policy is adopted. Capel's
projections and those of other forecasters indicate that inflation over the
next five years would be unlikely to fall below 3 per cent under a Labour or
Liberal Democrat government while fluctuating around 2.5 per cent under the
Tories. Although the National Institute of Economic and Social Research
expects unemployment to be 300,000 lower under Labour in 1993, other
forecasters expect no such improvement.
Where policies will make a difference, however, is in the experience of
regions, sectors and individuals. For all three, Mr Smith's tax policies
represent a step into the unknown.
His income tax proposals will hit the high-earning south-east, where,
according to the Reward Group of consultants, incomes need to be up to 25
per cent higher than the national average to ensure an average standard of
living. This region, accounting for 35 per cent of UK gross domestic
product, has been worst affected by the recession.
On average, Labour's Budget will cost families with incomes of more than
Pounds 52,000 a year more than Pounds 105 a week. The independent Institute
for Fiscal Studies calculates that annual total disposable income will fall
by Pounds 1.5bn in the south (comprising London, the south-east and
south-west) under a Labour government.
For most industrialists, the prospect of such a radical redistribution of
income has more than offset any satisfaction over Labour's plans to boost
investment. Sir John Banham, the director general of the Confederation of
British Industry, has warned that Labour's tax plans could turn the
recession into a slump. Lord Weir, chairman of the Glasgow-based Weir Group
of engineering companies, would expect 'a much slower recovery under
Labour'. Sir Eric Parker, chief executive of the Trafalgar House
construction and shipping conglomerate, believes that the extension of the 9
per cent employees' National Insurance contribution to earnings of more than
Pounds 21,060 a year in particular would increase pressure for higher wages
among middle managers and damage the UK's 'sickly' housing market.
However, the Tories' hands-off attitude towards industry has also been
unwelcome. Mr Philip Hughes, the founder and former chairman of Logica, the
software company, believes Labour's more interventionist approach would
benefit UK industry in foreign markets. Mr Hughes also backs the minimum
wage as a step towards making Britain a high-wage, high-productivity nation.
By contrast, a change of government would mean 'all sorts of problems for
people dependent on fee-based income in the City', according to Mr Keith
Skeoch, James Capel's chief UK economist.
Mergers and acquisitions, in particular, would be subject to tighter
controls and Mr Skeoch expresses some concern for the banking industry if
the economy in the south-east is depressed further. Retailing would also be
less likely to prosper under Labour, because the higher earners tend to be
the higher spenders, although stores selling basic goods, might profit from
increased incomes for the poor.
In the longer term, the choice of government could have more profound
effects on the economy. Labour's interventionist leanings could have a more
significant impact on policy if its economic recovery plan ran into trouble.
The redistributive tax policies of both Labour and the Liberal Democrats
could influence the career choices of entrants into the job market,
affecting the long-term competitiveness of the country by reducing the
attractions for young people of arduous wealth-creating jobs in industry and
commerce. Companies may also be tempted to step up investment abroad.
To many outsiders, the policies of Mr Smith and his colleagues have an
uncanny resemblance to those of Germany in the 1970s, but with the
significant addition of promoting modern computer-controlled technology.
That German model worked well in a difficult international environment. But
it finally foundered on an excess of public spending, leaving West Germany
as a slow-growth nation until unification.

FT  04 APR 92 / Election 1992: Leaders put faith in gaining voters' trust -
This Week's Campaign
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN MAJOR climbed on to his soapbox, Mr Neil Kinnock into his Daimler
and Mr Paddy Ashdown stood on a self-made pedestal. The voters said they had
not made up their minds.
If there was a single lesson to be drawn from the final full week of the
campaign it was that the outcome depends still on where the electorate
strikes the balance between fear and resentment. For the moment, resentment
of the Conservatives' economic record has an edge over fear of Labour's
socialist past.
Mr Kinnock travels the country in the style of a prime minister. Still a man
of the people, but one who has earned the right to a black limousine and
police outriders by rescuing his party from extremist oblivion. Labour's
image-makers - the best by far in the business - have sculpted his
front-bench team into a cabinet-in-waiting. Mr John Smith has the manner of
a man who became chancellor some time ago and is waiting only for the voters
to rubber-stamp his reappointment.
In Mr Kinnock's entourage there is confidence that the Conservatives are
beaten; but less certainty that he will lead a majority government on April
10. The Labour leader has told senior colleagues that there can be no
fumbles during the last few days. They want him to rein in his frequently
careless exuberance.
He is cheered by two things. The message of the opinion polls - public and
private - is that the voters' preoccupations are Labour's issues.
Unemployment, health, education and the poll tax top the list of concerns.
Tax, defence, trades unions and law and order - the issues at the heart of
Mr Major's campaign - strike fewer chords in a recession.
More important, Mr Kinnock's advisers insist that all the evidence suggests
that their support has stayed firmly on the right side of 40 per cent
through the campaign. They calculate that the same figure on April 9 would
put Mr Kinnock in Downing Street, even if it did not give him an overall
majority.
Labour's glitzy campaign - jolted last week by the row over its
controversial health broadcast - is now back into a steady stride. Its
themes are self-reinforcing.
After 13 years, there can be no more excuses for the recession, the poll tax
or the run-down of the welfare state. Labour's alternative is sober,
responsible and modern. The voters will get what they see - the tax changes
set out in last month's shadow Budget and the programme outlined in
yesterday's draft of Mr Kinnock's first Queen's Speech.
The Labour leader has been careful to stress he is not seeking unfettered
power.  His conciliatory language this week on electoral reform was aimed at
voters in the centre ground rather than Mr Ashdown.
Together, those threads create what remains the campaign's most potent
slogan: 'It's time for change'.
Mr Major has not given up. The crop of opinion polls earlier this week
showing a decisive Labour lead created near-panic in Central Office. At
least one cabinet minister was ready to speculate on whether Mr Michael
Heseltine or Mr Kenneth Clarke would succeed Mr Major as leader in
opposition. Veterans of previous campaigns complained that Mr Chris Patten's
effort was a shambles.
The subsequent surveys showing Mr Ashdown's Liberal Democrats drawing
support from Labour as well as the Tories steadied nerves. By last night the
view of senior ministers was that the election had not been won this week
for Mr Major, but neither had it been lost.
The theme for the final week - still based on the slogan You Can't Trust
Labour - has at last been set in a coherent framework. Higher taxes, rising
mortgage rates and a return to state intervention would stifle an emerging,
if still scarcely visible, economic recovery.
Mr Major's soapbox appearances in market squares around the country are
incomprehensible to political sophisticates. But the message from his party
activists is that the voters much prefer them to the prime minister's
occasional attempts to emulate Mr Heseltine. So the sharpest attacks on Mr
Kinnock's fitness for office - still, the Tories insist, an issue on the
doorstep - are being left to the environment secretary.
The strategy is to frighten waverers back into the fold: to persuade the
stay-at-homes and would-be Liberal Democrats that there is no other choice
but Mr Major or Mr Kinnock. Party activists insist that there are enough
floating votes to be won back to deny the Labour leader the keys to Downing
Street.
Perhaps. But Mr Ashdown's decision to stand above the two-party fray has so
far hurt the Tories more than Labour. There can be no certainty that Mr
Heseltine's red-blooded attacks on Mr Kinnock will not intensify the mood of
disenchantment from which the Liberal Democrats have prospered.
The election may not have been lost to the Tories. But next week Mr Major
will no longer be able to content himself with a campaign that does no more
than prevent Mr Kinnock from extending his lead.

FT  04 APR 92 / Election 1992: Poll puts London as neck-and-neck
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN and GARETH SMYTH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LABOUR AND the Tories are running neck-and-neck in London, according to the
latest Harris poll for London Weekend Television.
The poll coincided with a regional breakdown of six national polls by the
BBC for last night's television news, which suggested that Labour was on
course to be the largest party in the Commons, but without an overall
majority.
Sixty five of the 94 Conservative-held seats Labour probably needs for an
overall majority are in London, the north-west and the Midlands. The BBC
analysis recorded swings towards Labour of 8 per cent in London - one point
more than the Harris survey - 8 per cent in the Midlands, and 6 per cent in
the north of England.
The regional pattern appears to confound the assumption by some commentators
that the uneven distribution of marginals across the country would favour
the Conservatives.
The BBC analysis projects 82 Labour gains, leaving Mr Neil Kinnock around 15
seats short of an overall majority.
Last night's Harris London poll suggests Labour may fall just short of
securing the seats in the capital it needs to give Mr Kinnock an overall
majority. The 7 per cent swing should deliver 17 of the 21 Tory-held London
marginals that the party has targeted. A similar poll a week earlier had
shown a swing to Labour of more than 8 per cent.
The survey puts both leading parties on 40 per cent, wiping out Labour's
two-point lead of a week earlier. The Liberal Democrats are up one point on
18 per cent.
Almost two thirds of those questioned thought taxes for the average family
would rise under Labour, although few expected the increase to exceed Pounds
20 a week but the issue of tax continued to lag far behind the traditional
Labour strengths of health and education in terms of importance.

FT  04 APR 92 / Election 1992: Smith and Lang launch attacks on SNP
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN SMITH, the shadow chancellor, yesterday warned that Scots would be
playing into the Conservative party's hands if they voted for the Scottish
National party. The only way to get rid of the Tory government was to vote
Labour, he said.
Meanwhile at a campaign meeting in Newton Stewart, in his marginal
constituency of Galloway and Upper Nithsdale, Mr Ian Lang, the Scottish
secretary, attacked the SNP as the 'cutting crew' of Scottish politics.
'A separate Scotland would have an annual budget deficit starting at Pounds
5bn. That is Pounds 1,000 a year for every man, woman and child in Scotland.
'Because of that deficit, public spending in Scotland would be cut. The
health service would be cut. Schools would be cut. Housing would be cut.
Roads would be cut.'
Taxes would have to rise to fund the vast deficit a separate Scotland would
incur, he warned.
Mr Smith was speaking in Glasgow following publication of an opinion poll
showing support for the SNP at 31 per cent, its highest level since 1989 and
only seven points behind Labour on 38 per cent.
The poll, by Market Research Scotland for Grampian Television and the
Aberdeen Press &amp; Journal newspaper, put the SNP four points above their
level in other recent polls and Labour about four points below. Mr Murray
Elder, Labour's Scottish organiser, said there was 'no underlying evidence
that this poll is a fair reflection of where we stand.'
Mr Smith said: 'A vote for Labour is a vote for a Labour government in just
seven days' time. Scots voters must now ask why make a protest when you can
make a difference?'
Labour fears that strong support for the SNP could enable the Conservatives
to hold seats by reducing the Labour vote.
A letter from Mr Lang to Mr John Major, which was leaked to Labour,
indicated the Conservatives wanted to use the SNP for this purpose.
Mr Alex Salmond, leader of the SNP, claimed yesterday that his party was on
course for an election victory which would end 'Conservative colonial rule'
in Scotland.
Mr Smith said a Scottish parliament, which a Labour government intends to
set up in its first session, would not have a say in macro-economic policy.
Its contribution to economic development would be mainly through training,
education and local authorities. The Scottish parliament would mean
democratic control in Scotland of powers which were already devolved
administratively to the Scottish Office.
This appeared to confirm the thrust of a paper by economists on the economic
effects of constitutional change in Scotland published this week by Bell
Lawrie White, the Edinburgh stockbrokers, which said a devolved Scottish
parliament would have limited economic powers, contrary to the claims of
many of its supporters.

FT  04 APR 92 / Election 1992: Smith's timing - Ballot Box
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
John Smith, the shadow chancellor, does not always behave as impeccably in
Scotland as in England. At a press conference in Glasgow yesterday, he
arrived almost 20 minutes late and the chairman brought it to a premature
close after an Independent reporter persisted with a question. Smith then
gave TV interviews, although he later had the grace to sit down for a few
minutes with some of the journalists.
Indeed, the Labour party in general is being a bit peremptory with the
Scots. The launch of the party's Scottish manifesto in Edinburgh a few weeks
ago also started late and the questioning was curtailed almost as soon as it
had begun.

FT  04 APR 92 / Election 1992: Tory doctors - Ballot Box
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Perhaps surprisingly, given everything that you read, the Tories are still
the favourite political party of the family doctors. According to a poll in
today's Pulse, the weekly magazine for GPs, 29.8 per cent of them say that
they will vote Conservative on Thursday. That compares with 24.8 per cent
for the Liberal Democrats and only 17.8 per cent for the Labour party.
On the other hand, more than 45 per cent of the doctors said they had voted
Tory in 1987. Still, 52 per cent of them favour Tory tax policies.

FT  04 APR 92 / Election 1992: Football crazy - Ballot Box
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
John Major is not interested only in First Division Chelsea. The prime
minister is believed to be on the brink of offering help to the Third and
Fourth Divisions in the football league.
The clubs are under instructions from the Taylor report to introduce
all-seater stadiums by August 1999, and some say they can't afford it. Major
is sympathetic and is suggesting that Taylor should not be taken too
literally among the lower orders. Roy Hattersley, a staunch supporter of
First Division Sheffield Wednesday, was also offering help yesterday. This,
of course, has nothing to do with the general election.

FT  04 APR 92 / Election 1992: Ineffectual dons - Ballot Box
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
University dons have never been bosom pals of the Tories. Remember the
litany of 365 economists savaging Sir Geoffrey Howe in 1981, not to mention
Oxford's ostentatious refusal to award an honorary degree to Margaret
Thatcher.
Yesterday's attack on the government by 900 dons - 115 of them from Oxford -
is therefore par for the course. So are polls suggesting that the Tory don
vote has fallen a third behind the Liberal Democrats - down to a meagre 17
per cent.
Might one dare to ask, quite what the dons expect to get out of a Labour
government? Jack Straw's spending plans would add 0.7 per cent to the
education budget - and even that is to go mainly to primary schools, not
Oxbridge high tables. Where are the 100,000 extra students planned for the
next decade to go? And who is to teach them?
Just as well, perhaps, that Straw was made a visiting fellow of Oxford's
Nuffield College before the election.

FT  04 APR 92 / Election 1992: Foot starts his last pilgrimage - Ballot Box
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Michael Foot, the grand old man of Labour politics, is to spend the next six
days on a valedictory stump of Wales, the country that resurrected his
political career in 1960 and subsequently virtually adopted him.
Yesterday he retraced his steps to Monmouth where as a young man of 22 he
first entered the hustings at the 1935 general election. From there, the
78-year-old former leader of the party travelled to Montgomery and today he
is in Clwyd South-West. Further stops will take him on via Caernarfon, Ynys
Mon (better known as Anglesey), Pembroke, Gower and Brecon and Radnor
before, on polling day, he reaches his political home for the past 32 years
in Blaenau-Gwent.
The place used to be called Ebbw Vale. It was there that Foot wrote his
biography of his friend and mentor Nye Bevan and it is from there that he
will say goodbye to British politics.

FT  04 APR 92 / Election 1992: Heading towards a hung family
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
With five days to go before polling day, Paul Cheeseright returns to the
Martins, the FT's family of floating voters, to gauge the effect of the
party campaigns.
OLD wounds re-opened in the Martin household this week. The knife to the
scar was the Duke of Westminster's poll tax bill of Pounds 68. As that is
little more than a third of the bill facing Russell, 18, on Pounds 4,500 a
year and 80p a month over the limit for a rebate, the family was angry and
highly critical of the government and the poll tax. 'It really got me,' said
Lyn, Russell's mother.
'It's got my back up over the Conservative government,' said first-time
voter Russell.
'Bills. We're getting ours through now. The Conservatives should have
scrapped it straight away,' complained Tony, father of the family.
'It's the one big mistake of the Tories and they'll never live it down,' Lyn
came back.
'They've spent billions trying to get it right, but it's the government's
job to get it right first time,' said Russell. 'It's the number one
influence.'
'But it's over now,' Lyn reminded him. And so it is. The poll tax does not
figure much in the party political debate, but the bills plopping through
letter boxes are a reminder of one of Mrs Thatcher's less adroit moves, part
of the record which will be judged by floating voters such as the Martins.
For them, it has not been a very satisfactory week as the debate has twisted
from issue to issue. The tax issue came up again, of course. The Martins
rather like Mr Ashdown's honesty in his commitment to put an extra penny on
income tax to pay for education.
'The only thing that has come over to us,' Tony said of the Tory campaign,
'is that they're trying to put income tax down to 20p, but they haven't said
when.'
'The way the people will vote depends on how much they've got in their pay
packets at the end of the week,' Russell said dismissively.
Still, the Martins accept that the economy is the central issue. They remain
uncertain about the political approach to it. 'We know we're in a recession.
No party is going to come in, wave a magic wand and all the figures will
change,' Tony said.
Lyn didn't think Labour plans for a minimum wage would help employment.
'That's not going to create jobs,' she argued.
'It's going to put people out of jobs,' asserted Tony, adding, that on
general economic policy, 'nobody has come through.'
'You can't say anybody's got it sorted,' said Lyn. But as the Liberal
Democrats have become the butt of Labour and Conservative attacks, sympathy,
even enthusiasm, for Mr Ashdown came through.
Tony began to hoist his colours: 'Of the the three leaders, Paddy Ashdown
would make the best prime minister if his party was stronger.'
'He's come over honest. He's the common man's choice,' Russell agreed. 'My
heart is telling me to vote Liberal Democrat. My head is telling me to vote
Conservative.'

FT  04 APR 92 / Election 1992: Whiff of success may turn out to be a lemon -
Ralph Atkins and Richard Tomkins on why the Lib Dems may be winning the
campaign but losing the election
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS and RICHARD TOMKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DIRTY CUPS and packets of microwave curries litter the Liberal Democrats'
Cowley Street headquarters. Boxes of fruit block landings in the red-brick
Westminster building. Offices overflow. The party's staff and volunteers do
not care.
In a political tale of David versus two Goliaths, the third party's
slingshot has forced Labour and the Tories to wobble. Liberal Democrats are
relieved they have not been squeezed, pleased at the attention they are
receiving - but, understandably, not quite sure what happens next.
Mr Paddy Ashdown, the zest-filled leader is on a high, surviving on a few
hours sleep and the odd cigarette snatched out of camera shot. The swing
against the Conservatives and a trend towards tactical voting will almost
certainly win seats but Labour may also benefit from exceptional swings in
some areas.
Mr Des Wilson, campaign director, has brought professionalism and
pyrotechnics to campaign rallies and photo-opportunities, in contrast to the
Alliance's disastrously disorganised 1987 election campaign.
But there remains the air of an infant party, chuckling at its successes but
unproven in high political drama of the sort that a hung parliament would
create. Tensions among MPs of the last parliament over Scottish devolution
and on the toughness of terms for coalition government are palpable.
Less excitable insiders do not expect the party's share of the vote on
Thursday to be more than a few points higher than its current 19 per cent
rating in the opinion polls. Mr Ashdown openly admits he expects Labour or
the Conservatives to attempt minority government.
Third-party politics has always been, the art of believing the impossible
and, from the campaign's outset, the party has successfully defied political
gravity. Mr Ashdown knew he had to be bold, but the border is fine between
bravado and recklessness.
His pledge of a penny on income tax for education was vulnerable to a
Conservative obsession with opposition parties' fiscal intentions. The
decision to stand aside from the row over Labour's health broadcast, and a
macho leader's tour taking Mr Ashdown to as many places in the time
available, add to the impression of a zany strategy that, perversely,
happens to work.
The education promise scores highly in opinion polls. There is also popular
support for higher environmental taxes and for Scottish and Welsh
devolution.
The small, over-stretched, campaign team, has not been plagued by the
intemperate squabbles of 1987. The irrepressibly enthusiastic Mr Wilson is
teased, not detested.
Mr Bob Worcester, chairman of Mori, says Mr Ashdown, 'is winning the
campaign, if losing the election'. That is the paradox facing the Liberal
Democrats. National campaigning prowess does not automatically translate
into parliamentary representation under the first-past-the-post electoral
system the party is so keen to change - even in the supposed Liberal
Democrat heartlands.
Seats such as Portsmouth South and Hazel Grove, in Manchester, with Tory
majorities of 205 and 1,840 respectively are high on the Liberal Democrats'
target list. While in many other seats the Liberal Democrat will breathe
heavily down the necks of Tories there are few seats where the margin is so
slim.
Bath (held by Mr Chris Patten, Tory chairman), Cheltenham, Richmond and
Barnes, should topple easily but having been targeted for so many general
elections there is a sense of incredibility in tipping Liberal Democrat wins
this time.
Gains are more likely in places such as North Devon, dominated by
agriculture and tourism. Held until 1979 by Mr Jeremy Thorpe, former Liberal
leader, a 4.1 per cent swing would oust the Conservatives.
Other wins will depend on the precision with which the Labour vote is
squeezed in seats where the Alliance was second in 1987, and how local
factors are exploited.
Take Falmouth and Camborne, in Cornwall. Superficially there is no reason to
put it higher than a 'good prospect' but Cowley Street is extremely hopeful
because of the local factors.
Hugely popular for his maverick, pro-Cornish stance, the retiring Tory MP,
Mr David Mudd, (majority 5,039) at the last election, could have been
confident of retaining the seat. His replacement, the Olympic gold
medallist, Sebastian Coe, is an odd choice for a county where a candidate's
Cornishness matters at least as much as political affiliation.
Labour and Liberal Democrats have been galvanised into a fierce fight. The
Liberal Democrats start from a stronger base: they may also capture the
personality vote with their Cornish candidate Mrs Terrye Jones, the
articulate and well-known local council chairman.
Cowley Street knows it has to fight on more than one flank. It is defending
22 constituencies and is prone to Labour's advance since 1987, which could
cost seats such as Inverness, Rochdale near Manchester, Southwark and
Bermondsey in London, and Liverpool Mossley Hill - all of which depend on
the strength of the local candidates.
Net gains in parlia-mentary strength of more than about half a dozen look
improbable.
So, if in the sobering light of Friday morning, neither Mr Kinnock or Mr
Major are able to command a majority, Mr Ashdown's promises of how he would
seek to influence the government may begin to smack of arrogance.
Paradoxically, the tough terms set by Mr Ashdown could prove his saving. He
knows the difficulties he will have in holding Liberal Democrats together in
a coalition. The diversity of local factors which propel its MPs to
Westminster, give a complex look to the parliamentary party.
Pacts with Labour and the Tories are equally dangerous. Mr David Bellotti,
the victor of the 1990 Eastbourne by-election, risks alienating his voters
if he lets Labour in. Mr Simon Hughes, environment spokesman, has publicly
expressed his scepticism over a deal with the Conservatives.
The lesson of the 1977-78 Lib/Lab pact is that internal pressures could
become irreconcilable but a tough position, which ruled out a deal might
keep the party in one piece.
In a hung parliament, minority government with the instability and
indecision of which Mr Ashdown has often warned, would become reality.
Electoral advance would not have won him any influence.
He may have sold the electorate a lemon.

FT  04 APR 92 / Election 1992: Tories pin hopes on public profile
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SENIOR Conservatives believe the increasing public profile of MPs since the
televising of parliament is one factor that gives them confidence in gaining
an overall majority, in spite of the trend of opinion polls showing a Labour
lead.
One Tory strategist said yesterday this 'incumbency effect' - increased by
the expansion of regional television, radio and newspapers  - gave a better
platform than before to effective local MPs.
The incumbency effect is estimated to give sitting MPs an extra 1,000 or so
votes, based on a high local profile and the gratitude of constituents who
have been helped. Some Tories are suggesting the growth in local media means
that the effect in this election may be critically higher than in previous
contests.
The party's canvass returns are said to show that there has been only some
slight slippage in the party's support since 1987, when it polled 42 per
cent of the vote. In individual constituencies however, that slippage is
said to vary markedly.
Tories are playing down their expectations from the remaining opinion polls
saying they think people will 'keep the pollsters guessing'. The party
believes that ultimately voters will decide on the basis of which party is
best placed to take the country out of recession.
In what is almost an admission of the Tories' failure to set the agenda
during the campaign, however, Mr John Major has expressed privately some
frustration and regret that issues he regards as serious - such as
devolution and Britain's role in Europe - have failed to rise to the top of
the political agenda.
In particular, he is said to believe that there has still not been a full
debate on the full implications of a series of linked constitutional issues.
Senior Tories do believe, however, that the Tory campaign has succeeded in
making stark the difference between the two main parties, although they
entered the campaign with many people apparently believing there was little
to choose between them.

FT  04 APR 92 / Election 1992: Tabloids suffer pollster's droop - Media
Watch
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE IDEAL Home Exhibition. What a piquant setting for a tiff between the
Tory party and the Daily Mail, sponsor of this very English festival of
household gadgets and aids to better living.
Mr Major arrived at the exhibition on Thursday to find that he was not, as
he supposed, to be welcomed by Sir David English, editor of the normally
loyal Mail.
Party officials anxiously recalled Sir David's stern leading article of the
previous Saturday, in which he warned the Conservatives they would deserve
to lose if they did not 'raise their game'.
Thus has the matchless barometer of the Tory tabloids lodged at stormy for
most of the week.
Central Office's leak of the week was a dull economic tract written for
Labour two years ago by an Oxford don. The Mail, putting aside hurt
feelings, gave the story 'exclusive' front page treatment. When Mr Chris
Patten, the party chairman, tried to push the story along the next day, the
assembled reporters, I am sorry to report, laughed. Then their news editors
consigned the story to oblivion.
Indeed, the tabloids have shown distinct signs of pollster's droop this
week. Of the 41 editions published in the last seven days, only 15 made
politics the day's main story.
The distractions have been royalty - more on Fergie, then the death of
Princess Di's father - and would-be aristocracy; 'Lady' Rosemary Aberdour,
who diverted Pounds 3m of her employer's money towards maintaining her
fantasy life.
This unaccustomed uncertainty of tone in the Tory papers refects the muddle
which has so far characterised Mr Major's campaign.
Somehow even the Sun's offerings this week - revelations about the
residences of Mr Jack Straw, Labour's Education spokesman, and the claim
that Labour's Harriet Harman takes her children swimming at Dulwich College
 -have lacked conviction.
Meanwhile, the Mail's Anne Leslie was reduced to likening Mr Kinnock to Mrs
Imelda Marcos and Mr Paul Johnson in the Sunday Telegraph concluded a piece
entitled 'Labour: the party that hates England' with the thought that under
a Labour government 'real English culture - the culture of Chaucer and
Dickens and Turner and Elgar - will have to go underground for the duration,
with the risk that it might never re-emerge'. Alas, on the same page, Sir
Peregrine Worsthorne, former editor of the newspaper, opined that beneath
Labour's surface lay 'its Ernest Bevin English patriotism, its honest-to-God
Englishness'.
In a week when Mr Kinnock waltzed through three big TV interviews, these are
confusing times for Conservatives. Yesterday's Economist, in its last issue
before polling, could only muster as a 'best reason' for voting Conservative
that if Labour loses, the party will be forced to merge with the Liberals
and so pave the way for electoral reform.
It may have been this arresting, if superficial proposition which brought
out the contrarian in me. Yesterday morning, on Radio 4's Today programme,
Mr Major sounded more confident and positive than in any of his numerous
previous broadcasts. Only the previous evening, he had blown a News at Ten
interview by repeatedly insisting on the importance of his positive message,
while omitting to describe it.
Then I turned to yesterday's Sun, which bold as brass had a front page
editorial, urging its readers to swallow their recessionary sufferings and
back Mr Major. The argument, not unlike the Economist's, is that 'it would
have been a hell of a lot worse' under Labour.
Perhaps the Tories are rallying. But if you see Paul Johnson on the Bakerloo
line listening to Elgar on his CD-Walkman, you'll know it's all over.

FT  04 APR 92 / Election 1992: Battle over economy rumbles on
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH, DAVID OWEN and IVOR OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE WAR of words over the economy continued yesterday with the Tories
stepping up their claims that a Labour administration would have disastrous
consequences and Labour hitting out at the Conservative record on
insolvencies and unemployment.
The Tory assault was spearheaded by Mr John Major, who told a 200-strong
crowd at Meopham in Kent: 'We have got a very clear choice indeed at this
election - a clear choice between recovery under the Conservatives or
perpetual recession leading to slump under the policies the Labour party
proposes.'
Mr Michael Heseltine, the environment secretary, took up the refrain,
asserting that Labour's policies would 'flatten the economy.'
Labour's higher taxes would mean 'less take home pay which means less
spending which means less work for industry - higher unemployment and no
recovery,' the environment secretary added.
Recovery would come he said, because business believed the Conservatives
would be best for the economy.
For Labour, Mr Gordon Brown used figures from 'the government's own
insolvency service' to predict that business closures would rise by 67 per
cent in the year to April 1993. Insolvencies would increase to 35,000 from
21,000 if the Tories were re-elected, the shadow trade and industry
secretary projected.
'I challenge the prime minister to admit that Conservative policies mean not
only will unemployment continue to rise for many months to come but so too
will business closures and bankruptcies,' he said.
Mr Tony Blair, another of Labour's frontbench stars, used figures gathered
from British embassies to show London was vying with east Berlin for the
title of unemployment capital of the major industrialised economies.
According to the figures, unemployment in London rose by nearly 54 per cent
in the year to February, compared with an average of 14.2 per cent in the 16
cities covered.
For the Liberal Democrats, Mr Paddy Ashdown said that neither Labour nor the
Tories had put forward serious plans for ending the recession.
His party has proposed Pounds 6bn package of public investment to create an
estimated 600,000 jobs over two years.

FT  04 APR 92 / Election 1992: Fairbairn speech sparks row
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
LORD Whitelaw, the former Conservative party chairman, last night cancelled
a visit to Scotland in a row over a speech by Tory candidate Sir Nicholas
Fairbairn.
Speaking in Perth, Sir Nicholas warned that under Labour, Britain would
'become a country of aliens'.
He said: 'This country would be swamped with immigrants of every colour and
race, and on any excuse of asylum or bogus marriage, or just plain
deception.'
The MP, defending the Perth and Kinross constituency, also claimed that with
the abolition of the Prevention of Terrorism Act under Labour, 'the
terrorists of the IRA would come here as invited guests'.
In a statement, the Scottish Conservatives said: 'Sir Nicholas Fairbairn's
views are his and his alone. The Scottish Conservative party manifesto
states clearly that racial discrimination has no part in our society.'
Lord Whitelaw also distanced himself from Sir Nicholas's speech and said he
was cancelling his planned visit to the constituency today.

FT  04 APR 92 / Election 1992: Owen moves to save his old friends from the
axe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DR DAVID OWEN, former leader of the Social Democratic party, is expected
tomorrow to endorse Mr John Major, even though he will not vote
Conservative.
Dr Owen's decision has been influenced by loyalty to Mr John Cartwright and
Mrs Rosie Barnes, who are standing again as Social Democrats - they face
strong challenges from Labour in the south London seats of Woolwich and
Greenwich - and by the campaign itself.
Dr Owen has told Mrs Barnes and Mr Cartwright he will vote Liberal Democrat
in Bow and Poplar, in east London, where he lives, as a tactical move
against the hard-left Labour incumbent Mrs Mildred Gordon, who had a 4,631
majority over a Liberal in 1987.
But Dr Owen, who is standing down from his Plymouth Devonport constituency,
believes he can square his tactical vote with a personal endorsement of Mr
Major. Dr Owen's friends argue that even Liberal Democrats accept that the
next prime minister will be either Mr Major or Mr Neil Kinnock.
Dr Owen's endorsement of Mr Major, regardless of the strings attached, will
be welcomed by the Conservatives.
Mr Peter Gummer, chairman of the public relations firm Shandwick, who is
advising the prime minister, believes that Dr Owen's endorsement may
persuade many 'don't knows' to vote Conservative.
Mrs Barnes, defending a 2,141 majority in Greenwich, said: 'Everyone knows
Mr Paddy Ashdown is not going to be prime minister. If forced to make a
choice (between Mr Kinnock and Mr Major) I would reluctantly come down on
the same side.'
Mrs Barnes believes she has already squeezed the Labour vote as much as she
can in the working class estates of Deptford, where if the posters are
anything to go by she is running neck and neck with her Labour opponent, Mr
Nick Raynsford.
She hopes Dr Owen's endorsement of Mr Major could be to her advantage in
Conservative Blackheath, where the former SDP leader is due to canvass over
the weekend.
But any benefit to her from the soft Tory vote may be offset in Labour
wards, where the party is expected to use an Owen endorsement of Mr Major to
tar Mrs Barnes as a 'closet Conservative'.
In neighbouring Woolwich, which Mr Cartwright held with a 1,937 majority in
1987, the social democrats believe there is less opportunity to target the
conservative vote. Thus Mr Cartwright can see few personal benefits in Dr
Owen endorsing Mr Major.
Mr Cartwright, who says he would have a 'realistic reappraisal' of his
position and who is likely to join the Liberal Democrats, sought and
received a warn endorsement from Mr Ashdown.
He says Labour may 'try and misrepresent' an Owen endorsement for Mr Major
as proof that he too is a Conservative, but he remains confident that Mr
Ashdown's support and the fact that Dr Owen is voting Liberal Democrat will
blunt any attack from Labour.

FT  04 APR 92 / Election 1992: Labour plans early Budget in first
parliamentary term
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
LABOUR yesterday set out its legislative timetable for the first session of
parliament, saying it hoped to present its Budget before the end of May.
Mr Jack Cunningham, campaign co-ordinator, said bills would be introduced
during the first session to establish a Scottish parliament, abolish the
poll tax and ensure freedom of information.
These bills would all have their second reading before the summer recess.
'Victory is certainly within our grasp,' Mr Cunningham said. But he conceded
that no election was over until the votes were cast and promised strong
campaigning right up to polling day.
The party leader, Mr Neil Kinnock, said: 'We have constructive and realistic
policies to deal with the serious problems that the UK faces and will get on
with serving our country from the first moment of election to office.'
Mr Kinnock said that Labour's programme for immediate action included a
Pounds 1.1bn economic recovery programme to end the recession and to create
sustained economic growth.
He detailed increases to old age pensions and child benefit, and
improvements to the National Health Service, halting its 'privatisation' and
an immediate start to use the extra Pounds 1bn allocated to the health
service.
There would also be improvements to education, with investment of an extra
Pounds 600m over the next 22 months, which would include the provision of a
new books grant of Pounds 10 for every pupil.
Mr Kinnock said: 'The National Institute for Economic and Social Research
has studied our proposals and confirmed that our recovery programme will
lead to higher growth and cut unemployment by 300,000 as compared with the
effects of the Tories' Budget.'
Mr Kinnock also pledged to extend Britain's influence within the European
Community, ensuring that Britain was in the 'European first division'.
Asked about the campaign, Mr Kinnock said later in Southampton: 'We are
going steady and victorious but not triumphalist.'

FT  04 APR 92 / Housing starts suggest stimulus for market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE government yesterday welcomed a small rise in February housing starts as
further evidence that interest-rate reductions are beginning to stimulate
the housing market.
According to provisional estimates from the Department of the Environment,
12,000 dwellings were started in Great Britain during February, compared
with 11,300 a year earlier. There were 12,900 completions, against 12,500 in
February last year.
The rise took housing starts in the three months from December to February
to 35,100, up 3 per cent on the same period a year ago, while completions
fell by 4 per cent to 41,600.
Mr Tim Yeo, environment minister, said the figures were an encouraging
message for the economy as a whole, given that housing starts provide
earlier evidence of economic activity than other construction figures.
Statistics for January and February show increases for both private-sector
and housing association starts, with private starts rising from 20,400 to
20,800 and housing association starts up sharply from 3,300 to 4,600.
In contrast, over the same period, starts made by local authorities, new
towns and government departments fell from 1,200 to 500.
On a seasonally adjusted basis, total starts fell by 1 per cent in the three
months from December to February, compared with a year earlier, while total
completions fell by 3 per cent. Private enterprise starts fell by 3 per
cent, while completions rose by 1 per cent.
Housing starts are generally seen as a leading indicator of activity in the
economy. They tend to precede house price rises by as much as a year.
The Labour Party's tax proposals would penalise the professions, including
civil engineering, and prejudice the industry's future, according to Mr
George Dixon, vice-president of the Federation of Civil Engineering
Contractors.
Speaking in Harrogate yesterday, Mr Dixon said he was worried that Labour's
proposed structure of income tax and National Insurance contributions 'would
clobber if not the present take-home pay then certainly the aspirations of
the up-and-coming engineer or surveyor'. He urged Labour not to forget that
civil engineering is a 'profession with worldwide application, and a mobile
profession'.

FT  04 APR 92 / Concern over pension fund property investment returns
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN and BARRY RILEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SOME UK pension fund managers may be overstating their returns on property
investments, the head of a leading performance measurement firm said
yesterday.
Mr John Clamp, chief executive of Combined Actuarial Performance Services,
said that pension fund performance returns suggested that 'there is a
problem there'.
The CAPS service, which surveyed 2,760 separate portfolios with a market
value of Pounds 156bn, showed a great disparity between the weighted average
returns on property and the median performance.
The numbers showed that while the median return was 3.8 per cent - the
lowest of any asset category in 1991 - returns giving greater weight to
larger funds showed returns of -2.8 per cent.
Mr Clamp said that most of the larger funds sought formal valuations of
their property holdings annually, but he believed smaller funds were not
doing so.
'We have those who quite literally produce back-of-the-envelope
calculations,' Mr Clamp said. Thus the inflated returns from smaller
managers have distorted the picture of average returns.
Separately, CAPS noted a number of significant shifts in pension fund
investment last year.
First, funds are increasing their exposure to overseas equities, with the
average fund raising exposure to 23.8 per cent from 20.2 per cent in 1990.
The best performing sectors were Pacific Basin stocks, excluding Japan, and
US equities. The two produced returns of 35.1 per cent and 32.3 per cent
respectively. Overall, median rates of return were 18.3 per cent, inclusive
of property.
Also, the trend towards indexation appears to be slowing, although on
average, UK indexed funds outperformed the index they tracked by a
significant margin. Tracking error is much narrower among managers using
index-matching for their overseas portfolios.

FT  04 APR 92 / Players may strike for level football field: Jane Fuller
reports on the clash over cash between players and the Premier League
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THIS afternoon as 500,000 recession-hit football fans tread their weekly
escape route to the local ground, they might be wondering why players
earning up to Pounds 3,000 a week are contemplating a strike.
The answer is that their action would be one of the last Robin Hood-style
gestures in a world where redistribution of wealth is in decline. If members
of the Professional Footballers Association have voted to strike - the
result should be announced on Monday - it will not be to get more pay.
A 'yes' vote would be used by the PFA's leader, Mr Gordon Taylor, to try to
get a minimum of Pounds 1.5m from the new Premier League's television
honeypot. He insists that not a penny of that sum, which is twice the amount
the PFA receives now, would go on increasing players' wages. It would be
used to benefit all 2,500 players at the 92 English and Welsh clubs through
funds for training, medical insurance and hardship. Although the issue does
boil down to cash, Mr Taylor plugs the moral argument. 'The whole concept of
a football league with so many clubs comes down to the distribution of
money.'
The Premier League, of which the PFA has always been suspicious, is the
latest attempt by a minority of big clubs to keep more cash for themselves.
Democracy has not suited the 22 clubs that are about to switch from Barclays
League Division One to the Premier League. As one manager put it, the First
Division, 'which has the gates, the money and the power', was being outvoted
by the other divisions.
The row about television fees has come to a head because of the Premier
League launch and because ITV's four-year agreement with the Football League
is coming to an end. This season, payments from ITV amounted to Pounds 14m,
of which the PFA got 5 per cent.
Estimates of the amount that the Premier League contract might be worth next
season start at Pounds 18m, but club chairmen have their eyes on a rather
larger sum.
Mr Ron Noades, at Crystal Palace in south London, mentioned 'a minimum of
Pounds 30m'.
The pulling power is illustrated by the viewing figures: between 7m and 9m
watch The Match on a Sunday afternoon and more than 13m watched Manchester
United beat Barcelona in the European Cup Winners Cup last year. And that
other ingredient for a rise in fees is also there: an auction. ITV's Pounds
18m opening bid is believed to have been topped by a joint approach to the
Premier League from British Sky Broadcasting, in which Pearson, owner of the
Financial Times, has a stake, and the BBC. When ITV won its contract to
televise league and League Cup matches in 1988, there was a big increase in
the annual payment from Pounds 3m to Pounds 11m, since raised through an
inflation link. Mr Taylor may now be regretting the PFA's decision to waive
its right to 10 per cent of the proceeds and settle instead for 5 per cent,
although if Pounds 30m is the eventual fee and the PFA settles for Pounds
1.5m the rate stays the same.
Even with Pounds 3m of annual payments promised to the present Divisions Two
to Four, it will be a poor substitute for the present arrangement, which
sees Pounds 10m a year distributed on a formula not based on TV appearances.
But before the chairmen of the Premier League clubs are consigned to the
role of Sheriff of Nottingham, the pressures on them have to be recognised.
Mr Noades said the new deal might add Pounds 900,000 to Crystal Palace's
income, not to be sneezed at when last year's total turnover was Pounds 6m.
Of that, Pounds 2.8m went in players' wages. He thinks the club does well to
cover the wage bill with gate receipts. This is a position envied by
Palace's tenant at Selhurst Park, Wimbledon FC, which routinely sells
players to stem its losses.
On the capital spending side, clubs face a double bind: investment in
players to stay in the Premier League and investment in their stadia to meet
the Taylor Report's all-seater demands. It is a coincidence born of the
election campaign that, just as the lower division clubs face up to a loss
of television income, Mr John Major, the prime minister, and Mr Roy
Hattersley, Labour's deputy leader, have said they will consider relaxing
the all-seater requirement.
The estimated cost to the 92 clubs was Pounds 360m, with much less than half
coming from grants. This has led to a series of bond schemes to raise extra
funds. These have angered supporters, particularly at West Ham.
The London club is in danger of being relegated out of the Premier League
reckoning. And that sobering thought helps to explain why the glamour
players in the top division, whatever it is called, have sympathy for their
brethren.
As Mr Taylor points out, '65 per cent of Division One players started in the
lower divisions and 95 per cent of them finish their playing careers or
start in management there'.

FT  04 APR 92 / Architects' optimism on work prospects proves short-lived
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GLOOM has descended again on the architecture profession after a small
outbreak of optimism at the beginning of the year, according to quarterly
figures published yesterday.
Architects are becoming 'ever more pessimistic' about their future workloads
during the recession, the Royal Institute of British Architects says.
While the institute's previous figures showed that architects were becoming,
on balance, fairly optimistic about future workloads, the latest show that
only the largest practices are now even slightly optimistic. Only one in 100
large practices expects a rise while smaller firms still expect a big fall
in new commissions.
The institute says it is downgrading its predictions as recovery of the UK
economy appears to have been postponed for about two quarters. 'Our view is
that workloads will remain fairly static during the next 12 months, although
there should be an upturn by the end of the year.'
The institute's sectoral figures disclose sharp falls in industrial and
retail commissions, while new commissions in the office and leisure sectors
continue drifting downwards.
Only public-sector and housing commissions show rises compared with the
previous quarter. The institute says public-sector commissions are expected
to rise further when spending proposed in the chancellor's Autumn Statement
comes on stream in the new financial year.

LABOUR'S TAX proposals would make London a less attractive location for
expatriates than other European cities, according to an analysis by a
consultancy group, Andrew Jack writes.
The International Employer, part of Sedgwick Financial Services, said
yesterday London would become the most costly of a selection of European
cities after Brussels for an expatriate upper middle manager with two
children on a three-year contract at Dollars 1.38m (Pounds 790,000).
London is currently the fourth most costly, at Dollars 1.04m, after
Brussels, Paris and Geneva, assuming a basic annual salary of Dollars 84,000
plus school fees and housing allowances.
The analysis does not include the effect of tax changes that might take
place in any other countries.

FT  04 APR 92 / Minimum wage is unlikely to affect public-sector staff
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PUBLIC SECTOR would be virtually unaffected if a Labour government
introduced a national minimum wage next year at the rate of Pounds 3.40 an
hour.
There is a widespread assumption that low pay is a serious handicap in the
public sector but pay analysts say that recent pay rises and the
restructuring of lower grades has taken all but a few thousand public-sector
employees above the Pounds 3.40 rate.
Local-government employers, who yesterday rejected a Pounds 1,000 flat-rate
claim from unions representing 800,000 manual workers, say there are only
25,000 full-time workers and 200,000 part-timers below Pounds 3.40 an hour.
Almost all of those will be earning more than Pounds 3.40 by next year. All
white-collar staff, except for a few hundred 18-year-olds, are well above
the minimum rate.
The Low Pay Unit estimates that in the National Health Service there are
about 130,000 ancillary staff below the minimum wage level. However, after
the current pay round in which lower-paid staff have been offered a 6.8 per
cent rise, there will be only a few hundred left below the level.
Mr Alistair Hatchett of Incomes Data Services said there might be a handful
of cleaners or canteen workers in the public sector who would benefit from a
minimum wage. 'But the vast majority of those affected are in the private
sector, usually covered by wages councils, in sectors like retailing,
textiles, and private catering,' he said.
The National Institute of Economic and Social Research has estimated that if
the minimum wage were introduced in April next year at Pounds 3.40 an hour
it would affect about 2.3m people, almost exclusively in the private sector,
and would add Pounds 2.2bn to the wages bill.
Most of those affected are not covered by collective bargaining and some
analysts conclude that there will be little pressure to maintain
differentials further up the pay scale. That pressure is one of the main
worries that employers have about a minimum wage.
The TGWU general workers' union, the biggest union supporter of the Labour
party, is suing Mr Paddy Ashdown and other senior Liberal Democrats for
libel. The union says the party is claiming that the TGWU has advised
members to vote for Liberal Democrats in some marginal seats.

FT  04 APR 92 / Delay agreed in row over Jersey judge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SUE STUART
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE HOME OFFICE request for the resignation of one of Jersey's senior
judges, Mr Vernon Tomes, has been temporarily set aside after a meeting on
Thursday between Jersey politicians and Sir Clive Whitmore, representing the
Privy Councillors.
Mr Tomes, Jersey's deputy bailiff, was asked to resign after complaints from
local advocates that he took too long to deliver reserved judgments, in some
cases more than two years.
Jersey, in the Channel Islands, is a self-governing UK Crown dependency. The
home secretary is the Privy Councillor who has special responsibility for
it.
The island's judges are Crown appointments, as are its attorney general and
lieutenant governor.
Mr Tomes said the delays in delivering judgments were due to a work
overload. The island's politicians feel they can resolve the issue
internally, so a delegation was sent to London to try to get the resignation
demand rescinded.
Senator Dick Shenton, a senior member of the Jersey parliament, said
Thursday's meeting in London had been most helpful.
He added: 'We recommended the request for Mr Tomes' resignation should be
deferred for six months. This would allow us time to sort out the work
overload problem ourselves.'
Sir Clive Whitmore set aside the original request temporarily and will put
the proposal for a six-month deferment to the home secretary.
Senator Shenton said: 'We look forward to our request being acceded to.' He
does not expect to receive the home secretary's decision until after the UK
elections.
Members of the States, the Jersey parliament, are concerned that this matter
has been misrepresented as a constitutional crisis. The constitution is not
threatened and members feel they have a good working relationship with the
Privy Council.
Some States members refused to speak to London-based journalists yesterday
because they were not sure the island's position would be correctly
presented.

FT  04 APR 92 / Names hail victory on evidence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GOODA Walker Names said yesterday they had forced Lloyd's to disclose
details of Mr Kenneth Randall's investigation into Gooda Walker.
In a letter to the Gooda Walker Action Group's 2,000 members, Mr Alfred
Doll-Steinberg, the group's chairman, said that 'had Lloyd's not agreed to
publish the evidence obtained by GW Run-Off' his group would have applied
for a court injunction to prevent the drawdown of Names' funds.
Mr Doll-Steinberg supports the action at present before the Commercial
Court, which involves some of the group's members, but the group has yet to
take independent action.
Legal action is in prospect, nevertheless, if Lloyd's proceeds to draw down
Names' deposits to meet cash calls, he added. Lloyd's issued notices on
March 4 allowing drawdown of deposits of Names who fail to meet cash calls
after 30 days.
A cash call totalling Pounds 101m for Names on syndicates 164, 290, 298 and
299 covering losses in 1989 and 1990 fell due on March 2. GW Run-Off has
collected only limited amounts of the cash so far. Mr Doll-Steinberg said
Lloyd's intention to let the drawdowns continue was 'absolutely crass'.

FT  04 APR 92 / Disclosures stir Gooda controversy: Richard Lapper on the
troubles of a former syndicate at Lloyd's
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LLOYD'S of London has again found itself at the centre of controversy this
week with the disclosure of possible irregularities at some of the market's
worst affected insurance syndicates.
Evidence gathered by Mr Kenneth Randall, a former head of regulatory
services at Lloyd's, indicates that between 1981 and 1988 the Gooda Walker
agency may have overstated the profits of its syndicates and, in 1991,
failed to disclose reinsurance transactions to its auditors.
Until its liquidation Gooda Walker managed eight Lloyd's syndicates. The
syndicates specialised in catastrophe reinsurance business and in 1989 and
1990 delivered some of the worst losses in Lloyd's recent history. In 1989
losses exceeded Pounds 200m.
Some of the syndicates' Names are among more than 800 who are seeking
injunctions to prevent Lloyd's drawing down on their deposits in order to
fund the losses.
The case, in which the Names are represented by Michael Freeman &amp; Co, began
on Tuesday but was adjourned by Mr Justice Saville after receipt of the
affidavit containing details of Mr Randall's findings.
Mr Randall's investigation is being conducted on behalf of GW Run-Off, the
agency set up to administer Gooda affairs last October. The investigation
centres on the use of time and distance (T&amp;D) insurance - an insurance
policy resembling a banking arrangement used by many Lloyd's syndicates to
fund known future losses.
The 38-page affidavit details a number of concerns.
Between 1981 and 1988 the profits of syndicate 290, the biggest of the eight
syndicates managed by Gooda Walker, may have been overstated as a result of
the use of T&amp;D policies.
Mr Randall's preliminary analysis of audited accounts for the period showed
that gains from T&amp;D policies contributed Pounds 23.8m of the syndicate's
total profits of Pounds 32.16m (after personal expenses).
He calculated that the profit commission charged to Names 'which could be
regarded as attributable to profits generated from the use of time and
distance policies' amounted to more than Pounds 3.6m. The profits arise
because the difference between the premium paid to the reinsurer and the
limits of indemnity - the amount the reinsurer agrees to pay in claims at an
agreed future date - must be regarded as a gain at the time of purchase.
The amounts gained are offset by the cost of T&amp;D premiums themselves as well
as additional investment income that would otherwise have accrued.
Mr Randall said that his analysis had raised a number of questions that
warranted further investigation.
They include the issue of whether the dates selected for recoveries under
the policies inflated the profits of the syndicate. In addition, Mr Randall
is concerned to examine the impact of the deals on the syndicate's
liquidity.
Mr Randall's investigation also shows that information about the commutation
 -or early cashing in of T&amp;Ds - may not have reached the syndicates'
auditors, Littlejohn Frazer.
The years 1988, 1989 and 1990 were bad for Gooda Walker as losses mounted
from catastrophes such as hurricane Hugo in September 1989 and the European
storms of January 1990.
By April last year, cashflow difficulties were particularly serious. Mr
Randall said the agency's management asked its reinsurers, the Bermuda-based
Pinnacle, to commute six T&amp;D policies.
Commuting the policies, which protected the exposures of syndicate 290,
realised about Pounds 27m. Mr Randall said that syndicate auditors confirmed
that they were unaware that the four policies had been cancelled. 'The
syndicate auditors . . . inspected a number of time and distance policy
documents prior to the completion of their audit. They state that they were
shown the original policy documents of the four policies which had in fact
been commuted on 2 April 1991.'
Subsequently in June 1991 syndicate 298 also found itself in cashflow
difficulties. Four further T&amp;D polices - benefiting three other Gooda Walker
syndicates 164, 90 and 295 - were commuted in order to put syndicate 298 in
funds.

SUPPORT is widespread for the overhaul of accounting standard SSAP20 dealing
with foreign currency translation, according to a survey conducted by the
Chartered Association of Certified Accountants.
In a study of 32 companies, institutions, accounting firms and individuals
conducted for the Accounting Standards Board, the association found that
most organisations wanted disclosure in the accounts of any limitations on
the extent to which overseas assets can be remitted to the UK. That has been
prompted by the experience of Polly Peck International.
Many of those surveyed wanted clarification of reserve accounting, the
treatment of complex capital instruments, and hedging transactions.

FT  04 APR 92 / Private prison on Humberside opens its doors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD EVANS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN'S first privately run prison, the Wolds on Humberside, opened its
gates to public inspection yesterday before receiving its first official
inmates on Monday.
The Pounds 38m remand centre, to be run by Group 4, will eventually house
more than 300 adult male remand prisoners who will be supervised by warders
or 'prisoner custody officers' employed by the security company.
Standards set for various aspects of prison life are well in excess of those
in public-sector prisons. Stiff financial penalties can be imposed on Group
4 if the terms of its contract with the Home Office are not met.
Remand prisoners will be housed in 156 single and 72 shared cells, all with
en-suite sanitation, and each prisoner will have a cell key.
The prison is arranged in the form of six self-contained houses of 50
prisoners each, with access through electronically locked doors. This
arrangement is designed to confine any disturbances to a controllable number
of inmates.
Prisoners will spend about 15 hours a day outside their cells - in sharp
contrast to most remand prisons - and can use their time on work programmes,
education, physical exercise, counselling and recreation.
Mr Steve Twinn, the prison's director, intends to impose two levels of
'prisoner contract'. One of these will offer a higher quality of life,
including generous payments, to those who work and guarantee a higher
standard of behaviour.
Mr Adam Sampson, deputy director of the Prison Reform Trust, said it
remained strongly opposed to privatisation of prisons, but many of the ideas
being tried at the Wolds were welcome, particularly the amount of time
prisoners were to be allowed out of their cells. 'However, it must be
acknowledged that there are risks,' he said.
Nine unions with members working in prisons were also critical.
A spokesman for the unions said it was the 'height of hypocrisy' for the
Home Office to ignore demands for improved conditions in state-run prisons
while ensuring such facilities for the Wolds.

SOUTH AFRICA'S President F W de Klerk is expected to visit Nigeria next
week, in a breakthrough in Pretoria's diplomatic relations with black
Africa.
President Ibrahim Babangida, Nigeria's military leader and chairman of the
Organisation of African Unity (OAU), will hold talks with Mr de Klerk in the
capital, Abuja.
Although Mr de Klerk has visited several African countries since initiating
his reform programme, the visit to Nigeria has special significance.
President Babangida's invitation represents a stamp of approval for the
reform process from black Africa's economic and political heavyweight. The
invitation also brings closer the day South Africa becomes a member of the
OAU, given President Babangida's role as chairman of the organisation.

CONFUSION yesterday surrounded an apparent threat by Libya to the commercial

hand over two men accused of the Lockerbie bombing.
The threat was originally made by student protesters on Libyan television. A
Libyan spokesman was quoted as saying: 'The statement of the crowds has not
so far become official.'
But a Libyan diplomat told European ambassadors in Tripoli that countries
which had supported the sanctions would have their interests 'negatively
affected'.
Libyan officials were also vague over the protesters' call that countries
which backed the UN sanctions should evacuate their nationals from Libya.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE publication yesterday of lacklustre US employment figures for March
pointed to only a slow recovery from recession.
The Labour Department said non-farm employment rose by 19,000 last month,
less than half the increase expected on Wall Street. The rise was hardly
discernible in an economy with nearly 109m non-agricultural jobs.
Figures for February were revised down to show a job gain of 107,000 rather
than 164,000. The unemployment rate was unchanged last month at 7.3 per
cent, the highest level for six years.
The jobs report - seen as the most important monthly statistical publication
 -may lead to more cautious assessments of the US economic outlook. Big
increases in consumption spending in January and February were interpreted
by some analysts as evidence that a robust recovery was under way.
'The numbers for February were too strong,' said Mr William Griggs of the
Wall Street analytical firm Griggs and Santow. 'The March figures provide a
more realistic picture of the economy.'
The figures, while worse than expected, were not seen as bad enough to
prompt an easing of monetary policy by the Federal Reserve, which has held
short-term interest rates at 4 per cent since December. The Fed regards
employment as a lagging indicator and hopes that recent increases in demand
will reduce unemployment later this year.
Yesterday's report, however, confirms there has been no significant increase
in employment since last spring, despite three quarters of slow growth of
gross domestic product. Employment rose last spring and summer, fell in the
autumn and winter and now appears to have stabilised.
Manufacturing employment fell slightly last month after a small gain in
February. In construction, the upturn in residential real estate has yet to
translate into job growth.

FT  04 APR 92 / Beregovoy gets off to flying start in polls
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN DAVIDSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE appointment of Mr Pierre Beregovoy as France's new prime minister to
replace Mrs Edith Cresson seems to have achieved its most immediate
objective: it has won the approval of a majority of the French electorate.
A survey by the CSA institute for public radio found 66 per cent think that
Mr Beregovoy may be a good prime minister, and 52 per cent think he may give
a new impetus to government policy.
Another poll, carried out by the SOFRES institute for the newspaper Le
Figaro, said 50 per cent approved the appointment of Mr Beregovoy, and 55
per cent thought President Francois Mitterrand had learned the lessons of
the government's massive setbacks in the recent regional and local
elections.
The new government's first task is to reverse the record-breaking decline in
popularity during Mrs Cresson's 10-month premiership. The CSA institute
pointed out, however, that 70 per cent thought Mrs Cresson might be a good
prime minister at the time of her appointment, and 67 thought she would give
new impetus to government policy.
Inside the Socialist party, Mr Beregovoy's appointment has been greeted with
relief by most members of parliament who hope he will restore calm and
inspire confidence. Few seemed to expect, however, that he would enjoy
sufficient freedom of economic manoeuvre to launch new policies for fighting
unemployment or for improving the lot of the deprived inner cities.
In any case, economic policy will continue to be determined by Mr Beregovoy
from the prime minister's office. The appointment of Mr Michel Sapin to take
charge of the Finance Ministry, after a junior post in the Justice Ministry,
is a remarkable promotion for a young politician who is still not quite 40.
But Mr Sapin is a lawyer by education, with no special experience of
economics, and no special power base; moreover, his ministry has been
reduced in rank, and now merely shares equal status with the Budget and
Industry ministries.
On the other hand, the overall political balance within the new government
seems to indicate a clear strengthening of the position of the Socialist
party faction led by Mr Laurent Fabius, first secretary of the party, and a
loss of influence of the rival faction led by Mr Lionel Jospin, the former
party leader. This could lead indirectly to a strengthening of the position
of Mr Michel Rocard as the party's potential candidate in the next
presidential elections.
Mr Beregovoy is a member of the Fabius faction, as are a disproportionate
number of his ministers; whereas Mr Jospin, the former education minister,
has been shut out of the new team.
When Mr Fabius took over the leadership of the party in January, it was
through a deal with Mr Rocard, in return for which Mr Rocard was designated
the 'virtual' candidate of the party. The main significance of Mr Sapin's
appointment to the Finance Ministry may be that he is a rising member of the
Rocard faction.

THE Bank of Finland yesterday named Ms Sirkka Hamalainen as the new governor
of the central bank, in an attempt to calm the country's turbulent financial
markets.
News that Mr Rolf Kullberg, the governor of the bank for the past nine
years, had tendered his resignation because of a public dispute with Prime
Minister Esko Aho over economic policy sent a shock-wave through the Finnish
money markets in yesterday's half-day trading.
Ms Hamalainen, aged 52, will take over as governor on July 1. She has been a
member of the Bank of Finland's board of management since last November and
has spent the last 30 years at the central bank.

FT  04 APR 92 / Yeltsin's deputy quits as shake-up continues

THE shake-up in the Russian cabinet continued yesterday with the resignation
of Mr Genady Burbulis, first deputy prime minister and number two to Mr
Boris Yeltsin, who is both president and head of government.
This leaves Mr Yegor Gaidar, who was removed on Thursday from his post of
finance minister, as the only first deputy prime minister, and thus as Mr
Yeltsin's deputy. It confirms that Mr Gaidar remains very much in charge of
economic reform - even though its pace is to be slowed through a loosening
of credit policy.
At the same time, however, a senior World Bank official said he was
convinced the Russian government would continue radical economic reforms
despite the easing of financial policies.
Mr Wilfried Thalwitz, vice-president for Europe and Central Asia, also
warned that enterprises would sooner or later have to suffer a credit crunch
to force them into making structural adjustments.
'We will see an attempt to allow some temporary expansion of credit. . . but
very carefully tailored not to lead to hyperinflation,' he said before a
meeting with Mr Yeltsin yesterday. But he said the quicker the crunch came,
the more likely the reform programme would succeed.
Mr Burbulis, a long time associate of Mr Yeltsin, resigned 'at his own
request', according to a statement from the president's office.
He keeps his post as state secretary, and is expected to take over as head
of Mr Yeltsin's administration - probably replacing Mr Yuri Petrov - when he
vacates his government office on April 14.
The statement also said Mr Burbulis would oversee domestic and foreign
policy and the political aspects of the government's reform plan, as well as
looking after personnel policies and relations with political partries.
The wide nature of his duties points as much to a promotion as a demotion,
though he is removed from the immediate fire of the deputies, who may try to
reassert their power to veto cabinet appointments - a power they surrendered
last year at the request of Mr Yeltsin.
A government official told Russian journalists that he 'will be in charge of
all presidential structures and will co-ordinate the work of the police
force, security and foreign intelligence'. Such a post would carry immense
power, and brings together under one man oversight of agencies which Mr
Yeltsin had wished to unify in one ministry, only to be thwarted by a
decision of the Constitutional Court.
His sacrifice from his government post, together with Mr Gaidar's symbolic
surrendering of the Finance Ministry to Mr Vasily Barchuk, a long-time
finance official, is designed to deflect some of the criticism which the
government expects at the sixth Congress of Peoples Deputies, which begins
on Monday.
Meanwhile Mr Yeltsin is to appoint two deputy defence ministers to the
recently formed Russian Defence Ministry, which he heads. They are General
Pavel Grachev,a deputy to Marshal Yevgeny Shaposhnikov, the head of the
Commonwealth armed forces, and Mr Andrei Kokoshin, deputy director of the
USA-Canada Institute.
Aides to Mr Ruslam Khasbulatov, the Russian parliament's leader, said last
night that the parliamentary changes had been designed to placate his
opposition, and hinted there might be more to come, even including the
resignation of Mr Andrei Kozyrev, the Russian foreign minister.
The government also announced more generous social protection to accompany
the market reforms. Mr Alexander Shokhin, the deputy prime minister
responsible for social affairs, said the minimum wage would be increased to
Rbs900 from Rbs342, while minimum pensions would rise to Rbs800 from Rbs500.
Wages would be regularly reviewed.

FIERCE fighting erupted in Croatia yesterday, a day before United Nations
peace-keeping troops were due to start arriving to police a truce in the
former Yugoslav republic, Reuter reports from Belgrade.
Hospital officials in the north-eastern Croatian town of Osijek said 12
people were killed and 28 injured in an attack in which the hospital itself
was also hit.
Police in the town of Valpovo, 30km to the west, said five people were
killed and 10 injured in an attack there. Belgrade television reported two
deaths just across the border in the republic of Bosnia-Hercegovina.
The fighting, among the most serious in Croatia this year, erupted one day
before the first part of a 14,000-strong UN force was due to arrive to try
to stop nine months of conflict over Croatia's secession from Yugoslavia.
Violence also flared in Bosnia, prompting its leaders to ask the UN for help
to end fighting which has killed more than 30 people in the past week and
increased fears of civil war among its mixed population of Moslems, Croats
and Serbs.
Belgrade television said two people were killed in the Bosnian town of
Bosanski Brod.

FT  04 APR 92 / Election worries depress sterling
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STERLING came under pressure yesterday as a fresh wave of nerves about the
UK general election affected financial markets.
The pound lost 1 pfennig against a stronger D-Mark to close in London at
DM2.835, recovering only slightly in New York where it finished at DM2.8366.
Share prices also fell as investors showed worries about the outcome of
Thursday's poll. The FT-SE 100 index of leading shares shed 22.7 to 2,382.7
for a 65-point loss on the week.
Investors' fears focus on the repercussions of a Labour victory or a hung
parliament. In either case, the markets believe, nervous investors might
decide to switch funds out of sterling. If that happened, base rates might
have to rise, holding back hopes of economic recovery.
Some signs emerged yesterday of investors switching out of the pound. This
drove sterling down to within about 5 pfennigs of its DM2.78 floor in the
European exchange rate mechanism. Over the week, the pound has lost just
over 2 pfennigs.
Mr Paul Chertkow, chief currency analyst at the London office of Citibank,
the US bank, expected a further fall in the pound next week due to
investors' anxieties about whether a Labour government would keep sterling
in its ERM band. He added: 'In my view, Mr John Smith (the shadow
chancellor) would not devalue the pound. Even if he had to raise interest
rates after the election, the effect would be temporary and so I can see no
great long-term risk to investors holding pounds.'
Others took a less sanguine view. Ms Christine Shields, economist at the
Royal Bank of Scotland, said: 'The markets are approaching the election with
a great deal of trepidation.'
The pound's weakness against the D-Mark was exacerbated by the effects of
investors buying the German unit against the dollar, which fell on worries
about a faltering US economic recovery.
The dollar shed nearly 2 pfennigs against the D-Mark, closing in London at
DM1.6265. In New York it ended at DM1.62665.
Against the dollar, the pound was stronger, gaining nearly 1 1/2 cents to
close at Dollars 1.7435 in London and Dollars 1.74365 in New York.
Government gilt-edged securities - which steadied yesterday after recent
falls - have shed up to 1 1/2 points over the week.

FT  04 APR 92 / Labour push for middle ground vote intensifies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Political Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR NEIL KINNOCK pledged yesterday that a Labour government would strive to
build a new political consensus at Westminster in what appeared to be a push
for the support of Liberal Democrat and floating voters.
At the end of a week of campaigning that left the outcome of the general
election as uncertain as ever, the Conservatives last night used a party
election broadcast to launch their fiercest attack yet on the Labour leader.
With just five days until voters go to the polling stations, the prospect of
a hung parliament - and a possible second general election soon afterwards -
loomed larger.
Officials of all the parties were braced for tomorrow's opinion polls which
will give the first indications of the state of the election race since the
mid-week polls showed Labour with a slight advantage.
Mr Kinnock's comments were taken as a fresh attempt to narrow the options of
Liberal Democrat MPs in the event of a hung parliament by reducing their
ability to vote down a Labour programme, which would include many items from
their manifesto, such as Scottish devolution.
Speaking on BBC Radio, Mr Kinnock promised a Labour government would use
'its power to try and involve others and to show how strong and confident it
is by consensus'.
Later, the Labour leader refused to close the door completely on the
possibility of a referendum on electoral reform. But his stance on
proportional representation continued to fall well short of the terms
demanded by Mr Paddy Ashdown, the Liberal Democrat leader.
In an interview on the BBC's Newsnight programme, Mr Kinnock said his
personal preference was for any proposal on new electoral systems to be
dealt with at the general election after the one to be held on Thursday.
But he did not totally rule out the earlier option of a referendum on the
findings of an expanded commission on proportional representation.
However, Mr Ashdown, who has seen a significant advance for his party in
opinion polls this week, again vowed to try to vote down a minority
government which rejected proportional representation in its first
legislative programme.
He seized also on comments by Mr Kenneth Clarke, education secretary, which
Mr Ashdown claimed showed the Conservatives would be prepared to accept a
minority Labour government, rather than the need for proportional
representation.
In their election broadcast last night, the Tories renewed their attacks on
Mr Kinnock for his policy turnabouts on Europe, devolution and nuclear
disarmament. But a decision to broadcast the telephone number of Labour's
Walworth Road headquarters, so viewers could complain at what Tories say is
the opposition's gloomy image of the UK, was attacked as 'a silly prank' by
Labour. Mr John Major used the broadcast to reiterate the Conservatives'
claim that voters were faced with a simple choice between him and Mr
Kinnock.
On tour earlier in Kent, the prime minister mocked Labour's move on
electoral reform and again said he did not want even to discuss it.
'Cuddling up to the Liberal (Democrats) for support is like leaning on
candy-floss,' he said. But his attack was weakened by a call for a Speaker's
commission on electoral reform from Mr Edward Heath, the former Tory leader.
The final phase of the Conservative campaign, to be launched in newspaper
advertisments tomorrow, will focus on the positive reasons for voting for
the party as well as warning of the consequences on financial markets of a
Labour government.

FT  04 APR 92 / Kohl wants ex-Soviet states barred from joining the EC
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FORMER republics of the Soviet Union should not be allowed to join the
European Community, Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany said in Bonn last
night.
Presenting an ambitious vision of a continent comprising two linked economic
blocs, he said the eastward expansion of the European Community should stop
with the accession of Poland, Hungary and Czechoslovakia. Former Soviet
states should form their own economic zone, he added.
Outlining what he called his 'future Ostpolitik', he urged the Community to
sign special treaties with the newly-independent countries to help them
rebuild their economies and develop a second economic group which could act
as a 'bridge from Europe to Asia'.
Formal association agreements with Germany's nearest eastern neighbours
would allow them to become full EC members.
'The EC should also relate to the states of the former Soviet Union, but not
in the same way. The right means is through special eastern treaties, which
go beyond conventional co-operation agreements, rather than association,' Mr
Kohl told an audience which included Mr Jacques Delors, European Commission
president, and Mr Edward Shevardnadze, former Soviet foreign minister who
now heads the state council in Georgia.
'Our realistic aim must be to support them in their efforts towards real
economic integration among themselves,' Mr Kohl said. Once this had been
achieved, the goal must be to interlock the enlarged EC with the eastern
economic group.
Painting a picture of a politically stable, economically successful and
militarily secure Europe, he stressed the role of Nato. It had to remain as
the anchor of European security. Most importantly, only the continued
existence of Nato could guarantee 'the necessary presence of the US in
Europe'.
The Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe should also be given a
greater say in security matters.
To stabilise the situation in the east, he said, the west would have to open
up its markets to help businesses generate investment capital. In future,
all financial and economic aid should be directed towards helping the new
democracies to help themselves.
The economics minister, Mr Jurgen Mollemann, meanwhile announced a DM500,000
(Pounds 175,500) subsidy for an east-west economics conference to be held in
Munster next month. About 200 east European politicians and economists will
be entertained at Bonn's expense while Group of Seven and Portuguese
delegates will pay their own bills.

a couple who bend and shape metal any way you want
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER KNIGHT

<TEXT>
WHAT YOU see in David and Sheba Blunden's shop is definitely not what you
get. The place, incongruously planted in the less salubrious side of
run-down Acton, in west London,looks like a shambolic fusion of Steptoe's
yard and the Sheriff of Nottingham's torture chamber.
But what emerges from the shop's dilapidated frontage are the most exquisite
and delicate works in wire, such as hanging baskets, conservatory
pot-holders-cum-chandeliers, decorative rose arches and Victorian
jardinieres.
David, Sheba and their five workers make by hand virtually any wire object,
from a fire guard to a strawberry crinoline conceived by Joseph Paxton.
'The crinoline was designed because slugs can't jump. You can therefore
train the plant up through the middle and the strawberries hang through the
gaps without touching the ground,' says David.
Garden and interior designers have re-discovered the functional beauty of
decorative wire work, and with it James Gilbert &amp; Son, the Blunden's
business started by David's ancestors in the early 1800s.
It moved from Islington, north London, to its present premises, known as the
'new' shop, in 1881. The green facade must have been painted since then, but
with the grime thrown up by the passing traffic and the damage caused by
carrying tonnes of wire through the narrow door, it is hard to tell when.
'Look,' says David, whose turnover is around Pounds 1m a year and who is
clearly irritated by prissy visitors commenting on the shambles, 'I could
spend about Pounds 30,000 on the frontage and I'll bet you I wouldn't sell a
penny more wire. If people want to find me they will.'
And they do. Hurlingham Club needed new guards for its croquet lawns and
they came to David, who discovered that Gilbert's had made the originals.
When wire grilles were needed to keep pigeons out of the arrow slits at the
Tower of London, the restorers came to Gilbert's who made 48 individual
guards out of hand-woven copper wire.
The owner of Europe's biggest private conservatory, at a stately home in
Nottinghamshire, needed his set of hanging baskets repaired and trucked them
to Acton.
'These are really big baskets, about 9 ft across. We made them in the late
19th century and they have been in service ever since,' says David.
Wire, as long as it is properly treated, can last a long time, sometimes
more than 100 years. This is essential news for those uninitiates who are
used to cheap plastic equivalents or mass-produced articles, because the
price of decorative wire can seem steep.
A simple hanging basket from Gilbert's costs around Pounds 150 - some are
cheaper but others are a lot more expensive. A plain rose arch is about
Pounds 40 but the more decorative versions range from around Pounds 350 to
Pounds 650. VAT must also be added.
Gilbert's carries very little stock and most of the merchandise is made to
order. If customers don't have a clear idea of what they want, David guides
them through the shop's original Victorian catalogue.
This can be a somewhat uncomfortable experience because there is minimal
light and little space to pore over the fascinating designs on yellowed
pages.
David's office is just big enough for his chair, coffee cup, collection of
books - including such titles as Wire Industry Machinery Guide 1982 and a
thin roll of fine mesh woven in prime phosphor-bronze, worth about Pounds
4,000.
'We particularly like one-off commissions. Many of the things we used to
make are now available cheaply in plastic so we now concentrate on the more
decorative and complicated work that can't be mass produced,' says David.
He has kept alive the skills needed to bend wire. He makes some of the
pieces in a converted piggery near his East Sussex home, providing training
and jobs for villagers.
David does not like change. His office might be equipped with a fax and
telephone but this is the only evidence of the 1990s. The main tool in the
Acton shop is a terrifying machine dating back to 1906. Its job is to take
wire and crimp it into shapes that are suitable for making, say, a grill
mesh. The steam engine which used to provide the power has been replaced by
an electric motor but the rest of the Heath Robinson contraption is
unchanged since the turn of the century.
David tried a new machine once but sent it back when it failed to do the job
as well as the original. This experience has reinforced his winning
prejudice of sticking to established methods and traditional tools.
'If I start changing things it will probably all go wrong,' he says.
James Gilbert &amp; Son, 129 The Vale, Acton, London, W3 7RQ. Tel: 081-743-1566.
No catalogue but personal callers welcome.

FT  04 APR 92 / How To Spend It: Out of Africa . . .
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN WESTERN cities, where most of what we buy is machine-made, mass-produced
and standardised, the hand-made products from countries that machines and
quality controls have failed to reach often have a refreshing innocence.
The fabrics, the jewellery, the artefacts used in daily life, remind us of
simpler, happier days when dyes ran, seams came apart and sizes were not
always what they purported to be but nonetheless, some spirit of the person
who made them lingered on, imbuing them with character and charm.
Neal Street East, which is finding the recession long and grey, has decided
to bring a shaft of sunshine to Covent Garden with a selling exhibition of
textiles, jewellery and crafts from different corners of Africa. It starts
today and runs until the end of May. Although much of what will be on sale
is contemporary all of it is made by hand and usually by traditional
methods.
Probably of most interest to most people is the jewellery from north Africa,
such as the Berber dance necklace photographed right. Made from African
'silver' and amber (the resin copal), the necklace itself is Pounds 32.50
and the 'silver' Ethiopian Cross is Pounds 75. Much of the jewellery mixes
old and new pieces - old millefleure trading beads, with the pattern going
right through the bead, like seaside rock, are combined with silver or coral
or African amber. Some of the Coptic crosses from Ethiopia are old, some
contemporary. There are Berber bead nacklaces with gold smelted onto the
beads, there are earrings, necklaces and bangle boxes made from enamelware
and coral necklace with amulets.
From Botswana there are baskets made from the fibre of the vegetable ivory
palm tree. They are made mainly by the women of the Bayei and Hambukushu
tribes. Though, sadly, today many of the baskets are made on coarser,
broader coils, Neal Street East has made a point of seeking out the finest,
most delicate work still being done. Prices will range from Pounds 25 for
small open baskets and go on up to Pounds 150 for a large almost
laundry-size one.
Perhaps most enchanting, although harder to find a use for, are the African
fabrics. The traditional mud cloth of the Bambara people of Mali,
Bokolanfini, made from locally-grown cotton, traditionally combines a
traditional dark, almost black background, and creamy geometric patterns.
Sold by the piece, prices start at about Pounds 60. Use them as throws,
curtains, wall-hangings.
Enchanting in quite a different way is the Korhogo cloth from the Ivory
Coast - embellished with strange animals (one half cat, half tiger), with
fish and guinea-fowl, with goats and strange symbolic hunters and shamans.
Once all these figures were imbued with meaning, based on age-old stories
and traditions, today they are mainly produced commercially. This is not the
sort of fabric to cut up and turn into clothes - buy it by the piece, use it
for throws, cushions, wallhangings. Prices start at about Pounds 65.
Neal Street East is at 5, Neal Street, London WC2.

sophistication another sign of your position in the corporate hierarchy.
But, like so many symbols of business success, the complex, multi-function
telephone has now moved on from the office to the home.
When the British Telecom monopoly on telephones ended in 1983, there was a
rush for domestic novelty phones that looked like anything from a car to a
cartoon character. At the other extreme of the style dial, there was a trend
among the designer set for refurbished black Bakelite instruments from the
1930s. Clearly, both of these fashions were more concerned with a phone's
appearance than its performance.
Gradually, though, the home has become a place to start or complete the
day's business - an extension of the office in more ways than one. Indeed,
some executives no longer confine their endeavours to office hours; doing
business globally can mean making calls at all sorts of unattractive hours.
Talking, say, to New Zealand can be done more comfortably from the study at
home than the desk at work, simply because of the time difference.
So, many of us now need to equip our homes with office-standard
communications. As a result, electronic retailers are selling telephones
designed originally for companies but bought increasingly for domestic use.
In conjunction with the new exchange services offered by BT, they are
effectively removing the distinction between home and office telephones.
The sophisticated equipment marketed by Panasonic epitomises the advanced
functions people are demanding for their homes. Like most modern phones, all
Panasonic's have musical touch-tone dialling which is faster than
old-fashioned pulse dialling.
Tone dialling means you can conduct many of the new phone-in services - such
as NatWest's ActionLine home banking - directly from a keypad, And on modern
BT exchanges, tone-diallers can also subscribe to facilities like Call
Waiting (which puts incoming calls on hold) and Call Divert (which re-routes
them to another number). You cannot do this with old-fashioned phones: 1930s
equipment often means 1930s services.
Many of the new phones offer hands-free operation where you can talk without
picking up the receiver - the so-called speakerphones. And there is a memo
function which allows you to tap-in a number while someone is dictating it
over the phone instead of writing it down with a pen.
When you make a call using a number in your telephone's memory, an LSD
display will show what you have just retrieved and then time the duration.
Then, there are the memory functions. pHones now routinely offer between 18
and 48 'stations' - ie, numbers held in the memory which can be retrieved
either by pushing a single one-touch button, or by speed-dialling two digits
which retrieve a much longer number. And they offer not just last-number
redial but also chain dialling, which will re-try engaged numbers
automatically until you get through.
Why should you need such things at home? Well, Essex Man can use his to get
through on radio phone-in shows (no one with a traditional telephone can
possibly dial-in faster than Barry in Basildon with Capital Radio's number
programmed into his phone's memory).
By the same token, you can use them for such things as calling theatre box
offices (which are always engaged when you ring). This way, you can hit just
one button and call them back effortlessly until you are connected.
(Of course, a real prestidigitator has no need of speed-dialling. Hollywood
star Warren Beatty is famous for using all five fingers to push the buttons,
like somebody drumming their fingers on the tone pad, and he is said to be
able to dial a 10-digit number accurately in exactly one second).
You can probably remember your relatives' phone numbers and have little need
of speed-dialling from home. But a multi-function home telephone also
communicates in terms of image. It suggests you are the kind of person who
needs to communicate and keep in touch at all times; a person whose calls
cannot be restricted to the nine-to-five routine. And your real status is
suggested by the ease with which you make those calls. Your status is
proportional inversely to the amount of work you must do in order to
communicate.
At the top of the tree is the executive who simply calls to his assistant:
'Get me Jones in New York' - and picks up the receiver only when Jones is on
the line. At the bottom is the minion who has to look up the number, dial
the 16-or-so international digits, dial them all again if he gets a busy
signal, and must then wait to be connected and put through.
The less work involved in making the call, the more powerful the caller.
Thus, the telephone equipped with single buttons to dial and re-dial
numbers, take memos or hold calls has become a symbol of success only a
notch below employing the secretary herself.
(The only function that the manufacturers have got wrong in this sense is
the speaker-phone. In terms of status, you should not be using one yourself
but forcing others to use them. Ideally, you are in a position to make five
other people pull up their chairs and gather around a speaker-phone in order
to hear your words.
If, as the American publisher Michael Korda said, the true measure of
success is the number of people you can inconvenience, then the
speaker-phone is the best way of demonstrating your status.)
A home telephone is for making business calls, not for receiving them. None
of the modern facilities improves reception but all of them help in dialling
out. Which is just as it should be, because the only people who have the
right to call you on business at home are people in a more powerful
position. You do not call the boss over the weekend - he calls you. And so,
your ability to make calls reflects your significance - your availability to
take them indicates inferiority.
Returning calls in your own time reverses the equation. Mark McCormack, head
of the International Management Group, says: 'I seldom accept any phone
call. I would rather deal with it in my own time and when I can focus my
attention on the call, rather than on what it is interrupting. Initiating a
phone call also gives me more control and time to plan what I want to say.'
These telephones are no longer expensive. At branches of Dixon's, you can
pick up an Audioline Tel-45 speaker-phone with a 20-number memory for Pounds
24.95. The Panasonic range starts at under Pounds 30 for an Easaphone model
with a 26-number memory. For Pounds 120, there is a Panasonic that can
handle two separate lines, holds 40 numbers in memory, has an LSD display -
and makes you feel you are ringing the takeaway from Houston Control.
Retail chains like Dixon's, Ryness and Lasky's all carry ranges of advanced
phones but they tend to concentrate on cordless models and answerphones. For
serious desktop equipment - and the Panasonic range, in particular - visit
the electronics stores on Tottenham Court Road and haggle for the best
price.
Remember that what you are looking for combines the greatest degree of
sophistication with the least amount of effort. That's right folks - don't
touch that dial]

FT  04 APR 92 / How To Spend It: Shopping out in Paris and London - Food /
Giles McDonogh compares shops in two of Europe's great cities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILES MCDONOGH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ALTHOUGH I have been back in London for seven years, I still find it
inconvenient. Food shops are open neither early nor late. If you have run
out of bread or milk at breakfast time, you must do without. As early as
4.30 pm, fishmongers and butchers are wiping down their slabs and preparing
to shut; by the time most people leave work they have closed, leaving the
supermarket chains as the sole source of fresh food.
In some ways, I am luckier than most. I live in Islington, a well-favoured
part of town close to the West End. Steve Watt, London's best fishmonger, is
only five minutes' walk away in Essex Road; there is no lack of decent
butchers; and the Chapel Street market provides cheap fruit and vegetables
(although nothing that might be called exotic). The chains include Sainsbury
and Marks &amp; Spencer in Liverpool Road and The Market (the best for wine but
the worst for virtually everything else) round the corner in Upper Street.
The problem is that I have never wholly got used to shopping in
supermarkets. As a single man I am never sure before the evening whether I
am staying in or going out. Consequently, I decide what I am going to eat at
seven or so. By that time, the only solution is to rummage through the meat
selection at the supermarket: never a thrilling prospect.
Life would be easier if I admitted the existence of convenience foods, but I
do not; I refuse to stockpile food and have the deepest horror of deep
freezes. The result can be a sadly monotonous diet of steak or chops.
Paris was altogether different. I lived in the French gastropolis for seven
years before returning to London: pretty well everything was available when
you needed it and, in spite of a number of changes for the worse, it remains
a gourmand's paradise.
At some time or other I have lived in almost every one of the city's 20
arrondissements, but the area I know best is Montparnasse. It is a Parisian
village like any other; nothing particularly special by local standards. On
Wednesday and Saturday mornings, a market covered a length of the boulevard
Edgar Quinet in the shadow of the Montparnasse Tower. On Tuesdays and
Fridays, another morning market could be found along a stretch of the
boulevard Raspail. If you needed a market open in the afternoon, Thursdays
and Sunday mornings, there was the rue de Buci on the other side of the
Luxembourg Gardens, providing a useful objective for a Sunday morning walk.
What made these three markets so different to Chapel Street was the variety
of produce on sale. Stalls groaned under fresh poultry, neatly-trimmed legs
of lamb or Mediterranean fish. A Norman farmer would arrange his own
Camemberts and fromage frais on a trestle table. Piles of ceps and
chanterelles appeared in season. Moreover, every stall-holder was on hand to
volunteer information on how best to prepare what was being offered.
Within a few hundred metres of my door there were a dozen bakers, all of
whom were working long before I had even thought of breakfast. Some used
ready-made dough, but it was not long before you realised who was good and
who was not. On the other side of the boulevard de Montparnasse, in the rue
Delambre, a fishmonger followed the nice old custom of popping a lemon and a
bunch of parsley into your bag with the fish.
A good cheesemonger was next door while, at the end of the street (now,
sadly, gone), a real craftsman charcutier was open on the generally
miserable Mondays to sell fresh pork and those juicy steaks the French call
onglets. All the local shops were open to 7.30 pm, making last-minute
shopping the rule for most busy working people. While Monday reduced some
people to the horse butcher, Sunday mornings were like any other. Even at
Christmas, you could still shop in the morning and drop into one of the
local brasseries to buy a few dozen oysters to serve your friends before the
festive lunch.
The only time when Paris seemed as barren as London was during August, when
the shopkeepers had an unfortunate habit of disappearing en masse on family
holidays. During that month, the few of us who remained to face the tourists
exchanged precious addresses: a launderette, a tobacconist, a butcher or a
fishmonger which had decided to take its holidays a month earlier.
But standards have slipped. Many bakers are supplied from industrial
concerns, while charcutiers and patissiers often sell the same Russian salad
or fruit tart. But Paris is a long way from descending to the level of
London.
Part of the reason is that the local shops and markets remain viable for
working men and women in the late-20th century by opening early and closing
late. In England, the supermarkets deserve their victory over the small
shopkeepers: only they were wise enough to adapt to changing times.

FT  04 APR 92 / A baby boom goes bust
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SUITE 404 in a suburban Seattle office block looks innocuous. There are
tastefully-upholstered sofas, house plants, gilt table lamps. But the glass
office door is locked.
Neighbours are defensive. 'Have you tried knocking?' suggests the
receptionist next door. 'Yes.' She remains coldly unhelpful. 'Well,' she
says, 'they come and go.'
In the case of the Adoption Center of Washington, the inhabitant of Suite
404, a lot more has gone than come in recent weeks. A few months ago, the
agency - together with two sister organisations in Arizona and Massachusetts
 -was being feted for revolutionising adoption techniques. Today, all three
are mired in a financial imbroglio.
More than 200 would-be adoptive couples - including some from Europe - have
been stranded, having paid out upwards of Dollars 20,000 (Pounds 11,560)
apiece in advance fees. Natural mothers, who had agreed to have their babies
placed via these agencies, face confusion. On the regulatory side, officials
can only wonder whether the hodge-podge of state rules which governs the US
adoption industry even begins to suffice.
Adoption is a delicate subject. But even if emotional and ethical issues are
put aside, there remains a huge mismatch between supply and demand. About 1m
couples in the US want to adopt. The actual number of adoptions completed
annually is nearer 50,000.
Costs are high. Once legal fees and contributions towards a birth mother's
medical expenses are added, the outlay per baby may approach Dollars 50,000.
In general, only part of the money is advanced up-front. The process can be
lengthy - a year's wait is not unusual.
It is against this background that the story of ACW and its sister agencies
 -Southwest Adoption Center in Phoenix and Adoptions of New England in
Cambridge, Massachusetts - must be viewed. Southwest, the largest, was
formed in 1984 by a lawyer, Michael Sullivan. His partner, who has remained
in charge of the agencies after Sullivan's departure a year ago, is James
Medlock. Medlock, whose lawyer does not return calls, lives in one of
Phoenix's nicer residential areas, and has been described as a 'one-time
real estate developer'.
According to an enthusiastic article in Forbes magazine in October, Sullivan
started the business as an adjunct to his legal work, but it snowballed.
From the outset, Southwest's approach was radical: it made a pro-active
search for babies, advertising to birth mothers, and reportedly sending its
social workers to high schools and across state lines.
For several years, things went well. Although the agencies' fees were high,
adopting couples seen to have been satisfied: in 1991 the Arizona agency
placed 61 children.
However, the Medlock/Sullivan agencies tended to operate in states in which
the adoption regulations are relatively lax (or, depending on one's
viewpoint, progressive). In Washington, for example, for-profit agencies are
allowed; services can be advertised; and parental rights can be terminated
within days of a baby's birth. Financial information about an agency is
required only when it is licenced.
No one seems willing to speculate on when the agencies ran into
difficulties, or whether their problems stemmed from the core adoption
businesses, or from other interests which their directors own. 'That's part
of what we're still trying to discover,' says Julie Tolleson, an assistant
attorney with the Arizona Attorney General. 'At this stage, it all seems
very intertwined.'
In retrospect, there may have been warning signals. It has been noted,
belatedly, that both the Arizona and Washington agencies moved offices last
year, while Sullivan filed for personal bankruptcy.
Matters came to a head in March when Medlock sent a memorandum to clients
explaining that financial problems had developed and that a moratorium on
adoptions by existing client was being proposed. An 'immediate placement
program' was mooted instead. Under this, new couples could pay an increased
fee of Dollars 30,000 and receive a placement immediately.
According to a lawsuit filed in Arizona, a couple were told in February that
for a Dollars 30,000 'immediate placement' fee, they would immediately
receive a new-born child. Yet, the complaint continues, this infant had
already been matched with a Massachusetts couple, who had been waiting two
years. Both the birth mother and the Massachusetts couple were subsequently
told that the match had 'fallen through'.
Complaints began to mount in all three states, and on March 23, the
Massachusetts Attorney-General filed a civil action against ANEI, suspending
its licence. An audit by a Boston accounting firm revealed a Dollars 900,000
deficit. The authorities also moved the ANEI business, which included a
30-strong waiting list, to the supervision of another agency.
Two days later, Arizona followed, this time with a consumer fraud charge
against Southwest and its non-profit affiliate, Southwest Adoption Agency.
The agencies were prohibited from making any more placements or accepting
new fees.
Washington was last to act. It has barred the agency from taking any new
monies, but - as of Monday - no legal action had been taken by the Attorney
General's office and the licencing authorities were still deciding how the
75-strong waiting list should be handled.
In the meantime, couples on all three lists have been struggling to group.
Legal initiatives - from class actions to possible criminal charges - are
being investigated.
However the dust settles, an uncomfortable light has been shone on US
adoption regulations. That may send warning signals to couples in Europe who
have grown weary of the difficulties of adopting there. 'The fact is, there
are other organisations in trouble,' says William Pierce at the National
Committee for Adoption. 'The licencing laws are a patchwork'.

FT  04 APR 92 / Private View: Silent, violent, and nobody's pawn - Lennox
Lewis, the British contender for the world heavyweight boxing championship,
talks about hype, stardom, money and . . . chess
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTIAN TYLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THIS WEEK, by way of a change, I took on the British and European
heavyweight boxing champion, Lennox Lewis - and beat him.
He opened carefully, but soon launched an attack that had me pinned in the
corner. With a flurry of vicious exchanges, I managed to haul myself off the
ropes and dash for the open. Then, by a fluke, I found the shot to drop him.
Checkmate. But Lewis, British contender for the world heavyweight crown, is
a natural chess-player and if he had not just done five rounds in the ring
with Mike 'The Duke' Dixon, his sparring partner from Atlanta, Georgia, I
think he would have mashed me
At 6ft 5in and 16 1/2 stone, Lewis is big, strong and handsome. But he is
also a thinker and light on his feet. Watching him at training in a west
Country gym this week I was reminded of Muhammad Ali, The Greatest, and
Lewis's boyhood hero.
Boxers do not have to be thugs. There were five professional boxers in the
converted cider farm this week where Lewis is training for his fight with
Derek Williams, the Commonwealth champion, in London's Albert Hall on April
30. The others were 'Pepe' Correa, Lewis's new trainer, Harold Knight,
assistant coach - both from America - and Tex Woodward, the gym's English
owner.
Forget the grunts and thud of body blows, the shouts and flying sweat, the
heavy beat of the rap music. Here was a group of gentlemen in pursuit of the
noble art. I squared my shoulders, poked a punch-bag and felt a twinge of
envy.
Whether Lewis wins the crown or not (he is ranked fourth in the world but
his path to current champion Evander Holyfield is not clear), he sees
himself as Ali's heir, a boxer who uses his brains.
'I'm a deep thinker, very deep,' he told me. 'My friends call me 'chemist'
or 'scientist' 'cause I'm always thinkin' and always one step ahead. That's
why I like chess.'
I asked Lewis how he became a boxer. What were you like as a child?
'I would say I was quiet, very playful. I liked to fight, and I liked
competition.
What about schoolwork?
'I was quite good. The only thing I would say that interrupted it would be
boxing. But I did finish high school.'
Lewis was born in east London 26 years ago of Jamaican parents (he did not
know his father). When he was 12 his mother Violet took him and his elder
brother Dennis, who now works for him, to Toronto.
At school in Canada the other kids mocked his Cockney accent. 'So I would go
and fight them all the time. After about the third time getting the strap
from the principal - he's a nice guy - he said I should get into contact
sport because I was an aggressive kid.'
Were you?
'I would say more hyperactive. I wanted to do everything. I was into
everything. So I took up boxing and I seemed to excel so I stuck with it.'
Lewis had played American football and soccer and won a basketball
scholarship from high school. But boxing was his element. He won the World
Junior Championships and Commonwealth Games and then the superheavyweight
gold medal at the Seoul Olympics.
Three years ago he turned professional, accepting a bid from the English
stable run by Frank Maloney. The principal backer was Roger Levitt, now his
commercial manager, who invested Pounds 1m in pursuit of his dream of
begetting Britain's first world heavyweight champion for 100 years. Levitt
is perhaps better known as the head of the failed financial services group
who has been remanded on bail for alleged fraud.
I asked Lewis why he chose to come back to England.
'I could come over here and not be mixed up in the hype. The most important
thing to me was control over my career and destiny. Most boxers don't have
that. They gave me more control - basically every decision I have the final
say over, where I want to train, who I want to fight. I would hate for my
career to be wrecked by another individual. I would rather it be wrecked by
me.
'I look at the dark side of boxing - the bad promotions, bad opponents they
pick, the money they would take from you. I want to make sure there's nobody
ripping me off or using me in any way.
'I hate the critics that don't know anything about boxing. They go out there
and say 'I like to see you throw more punches' and not realise what you go
through.'
I asked him whether he would be able to sack any or all of his own team if
he wanted.
'Let me tell you, I employ all of them. You have to remember, without me
they have nothing.'
But you are still only 26. Can you really be self-sufficient?
'That's why I bring my mother into it, She advises me on certain decisions.
She can only advise me - but mothers always get their way in the end if they
really want it] I bring my brother into it.' Lewis may be a soloist, a chess
player, but I wondered how aggressive he was in the ring. How do you think
of your opponent? I asked.
'I don't have any hate for him. It's more like a competition. I'm there to
outdo him, to hit and not be hit.'
Do trainers tell their boxers to beat their opponents' brains in?
'I feel that's the wrong way to teach a guy. Maybe that's a way of
motivating them but I don't need that kind of motivation. I'm more the
silent, violent, deadly type. I would say I'm more vindictive because if a
guy hits me I'm going to hit him back three times for every one. You're not
supposed to hit me.'
Are you afraid you'll end up with scrambled brains?
'Well, like I said, there's people that's made for boxing and people that
aren't. My style is the art of hitting and not being hit. There's always
some risk but there's risks in everything.'
Have you met anyone who has made you afraid?
'I haven't met anyone like that, really. No. If I feel threatened something
else comes out in me. It's like putting a cat in a corner and he has nowhere
to go. The cat will leap at you and start clawing.'
One boxing critic I've read said you sometimes look bored.
'Because of my talent. I'm a natural boxer. I don't have to work as hard as
a lot of people. I can go out and run five miles where another heavyweight
will be struggling. That's what separates me from a lot of boxers. They're
brought into the ring because they're no good at anything else.'
Is there a danger you might get a big head?
'There's always that danger. But I've never had a big head, right from the
beginning. People look at me as some star. I don't. I look at myself as an
individualist trying to reach a goal.'
But you don't have that killer mentality.
'No, because boxing is a controlled violence. If you look at most of the
guys out there, after the fight's over they're huggin', which is the good
thing about the sport.'
You might think a heavyweight boxer like Lewis was the safest person in the
world. But it seems that other men, especially when they are drunk, cannot
resist provoking him.
'If a guy comes up and challenges me for a fight I laugh it off as a joke.
Yeah, I've had guys try and hit me.'
Have you had to put someone on the floor?
'I've sort of controlled them down. If a guy is drunk and he can't fight I
won't knock him out. If a guy takes a knife out on me . . . more times I'll
go away from things like that because I think: I could hit him, but I could
hurt my hand. Or I could hurt him, kill him.'
Thinking of former champion Mike Tyson's sentence for rape I asked Lewis how
women reacted to him.
'A lot look at me and say 'that guy's got plenty of women falling all over
him.' It's not necessarily true.' He is wary of feminine wiles. 'I've had
women sending nude pictures in the mail, following me home. It's really bad
like that. There's certain rules I stick by. I watch who's following me, I
watch myself when I'm out drinking. Women have different ways . . . '
Do you have a girl friend?
'I plead the Fifth Amendment.'
How much does money mean to you?
'You can always make money at anything. But how many people actually become
champions? I'm a gold medallist and that means more to me than money. When I
die and I go away I'll always have that in the history book. I don't want to
become a billionaire.'
What are your weaknesses, then?
'I would say I give people too much of a chance. I've been told that.'
You mean you don't like confrontations?
'Exactly. That's me. If I have to, I will. I have to psych myself up to do
it. If someone takes a liberty with me, then I'm very quick to put them in
their place. I would say I'm shy, too. I'm not as outspoken as people would
want me to be.'
Lennox Lewis sometimes sound too good to be true. But if he has the mean
streak he claims, I did not find it.
If you became world champion, would you try and do something to improve the
sport's image?
'Definitely.'
What example would you set?
'I would like to be a role model. A lot of athletes out there don't realise
that there's young kids looking up to them. Boxing taught me control over my
aggressiveness as a youngster. And I think it builds character. It builds a
man to have a controlled fight with a guy and then be friends. That's why I
stress to you, when people say 'fighting', it's not fighting, it's boxing.'
Thanks very much, I said.
'Want a game of chess?'

FT  04 APR 92 / Hawks &amp; Handsaws: Word on the street
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
  By MICHAEL THOMPSON-NOEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
I HAD dinner in Mayfair this week with my friend Wayne Talent. Both of us
have street cred, and both like a bet, so our conversation ranged freely
from today's Grand National to the UK election; from life in the universe to
who was in charge of things before Big Bang, with its concomitant invention
of maths, physics, art, literature and the bullets that conspired and flew
that mad day in Dallas.
Wayne is the younger brother of Keith Talent, the Notting Hill racketeer of
Martin Amis's novel, London Fields. Wayne claims never to have heard of
Martin Amis and his works. But he keeps in touch with Keith, currently in
prison, whose latest conviction for robbery is now regarded, by Keith's
solicitor, as unsatisfactory, given the fibs with which the police evidence
was contaminated.
Unlike Keith, Wayne never cheats, steals or bashes. He is a gentleman, a
friend of Dorothy's: 28-ish, gaunt, plausible, capped - and rich, a child of
Thatcherism. So rich that, like all the rich I know, Wayne is genuinely
untroubled whether Labour wins the UK election or not.
'Stands to reason, dunnit, Mike?' said Wayne this week. 'Tories. Labour.
Paddy Ashdown. What's the difference? They're all high taxers, all high
spenders. The only difference between them, Mike, is 175 Footsie points,
maybe 200 - peanuts, cashew nuts. Know what I mean? Have a crab claw.'
Wayne explained that what he needed guidance on was today's Grand National
steeplechase at Aintree, regarded by its admirers as one of the sporting
world's great spectacles, but by me as immoral.
'I know you don't like the race, Mike. Regard it as a bloodbath, akin to
torturing bears. But I can't resist Cool Ground, even though he's favourite.
I'm thinking of betting 15 thou, maybe even 20. What's your considered?
Street guy like you.'
I studied Wayne closely. His caps glittered polar bright. His hair-cuts cost
Pounds 100. If Wayne was planning to plunge on a runner in the Grand
National, I needed to disabuse him.
'You have got to reconsider, Wayne. The Grand National kills horses, but it
is also a graveyard for punters like you. Forget Cool Ground. The reason you
want to back him is that he won the Cheltenham Gold Cup three weeks ago and
thus stands a chance of emulating Golden Miller's unique feat in 1934 when
winning the Gold Cup and Grand National in the same season.
'But look what happened to the others that tried the same trick. In 1925,
Ballinode fell; a year later, Koko fell; in 1927, Thrown In fell; two years
later, Easter Hero was 2nd; in 1933, Golden Miller fell, though he won it
the following year; in 1935, Golden Miller unseated his rider; the year
after that, Golden Miller - again - was brought down and refused to jump a
fence; 1939: Brendan's Cottage fell; 1946: Prince Regent was 3rd; 1977: Davy
Lad fell; 1979: Alverton - a lovely horse - smashed his neck and was killed

'Whatever you do, Wayne, give Cool Ground a miss. Just hope he's alive on
Sunday. If you want my advice, put Pounds 500 each way on Willsford and
leave it at that.'
Wayne was disappointed. 'I want to bet big, Mike. What about Margaret
Thatcher? I see that William Hill is offering 25-1 against her regaining the
Tory party leadership before the end of the century. Think that's a goer?
Street guy like you.'
'No, I don't, Wayne', I said. 'I was struck, this week, by something Ivan
Straker said in the Racing Post. Straker is the non-executive chairman of
Seagram UK, which sponsors the Grand National . . . '
' . . . I bet he hates your guts . . . '
' . . . I imagine that is true. But he redeemed himself slightly by saying
that under Maggie Thatcher, greed and envy prospered. And then he said:
'There are two sets of values in the world - material and human - and I
accept you can't live without them both. But take away the human values of
trust, loyalty, sympathy, understanding, honesty, and you aren't worth a
bugger'. That is what he said. And Straker is a Tory, albeit a pink one.
Forget Margaret Thatcher, Wayne.'
'But I want to have a bet. Something really sexy.'
'All right', I said. 'Ring Paul Austin at Ladbroke, who is calculating some
odds for me against the confirmation of intelligent life elsewhere in the
galaxy. Could be very tasty. Take anything he quotes you. I recently visited
Nasa. Do I have to spell it out?'

FT  04 APR 92 / The joke is on the British voters: Dominic Lawson on the
funny story the media are ignoring
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DOMINIC LAWSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FIRST of April is the day on which the English prove that their famous
sense of humour is vastly over-rated.
The people who run newspapers, radio and television programmes spend days
deciding what rip-roaring uproarious spoof they will perpetrate on their
audiences, and come up, inevitably, with humour designed by a committee,
which is no fun at all.
The front page of The Times last Wednesday had us all in the aisles with an
account of secret talks over the future of Belgium. Flanders, said The
Times, is to join the Netherlands, while Wallonia is to seek union with
France. This April Fool spread rib-achingly on to the leader column: 'The
report on our news pages that Belgium may be dissolved as a unified nation
comes as a shock.' Only to you, Sir. The Thunderer goes on to conclude that
Brussels's Grand Place should be renamed 'Place du 1er Avril 1992'. 'Pon my
word] so it was a joke all along.
But all this was high class stuff compared with the BBC Radio 4's Today
programme. They had a twee little item, which purported to prove that
scientists had isolated a humour gene. Guess what? Germans don't have a
trace of the humour gene, while we British, apparently, have double rations.
Not on the strength of that April Fool prank, we do not.
But I am glad to say there was one normally straight faced publisher of news
and information, which abandoned its unremittingly high tone to come up with
a series of wonderfully absurd April Fools. I am referring, of course to the
April 1 issue of the Financial Times. I suppose the FT does have an
advantage in this sort of prank. If one is habitually serous and
responsible, a sudden outbreak of humour strikes onlookers as that much more
funny.
Here are just a few of the April Fool stories I spotted in Wednesday's FT.
I'm sure there were others which I failed to crack.
On the front page, there was a superb spoof item about the International
Monetary Fund offering to lend Russia Dollars 4bn after 'close scrutiny by
the board of the economic programme presented by a Russian delegation.'
The next day the Russian finance minister Yegor Caidar was sacked,
presumably when Boris Yeltsin discovered that the FT story was just a
brilliant prank, and that the IMF was not after all prepared to lend Dollars
4bn to a non-existent country, which, if it did exist, would have an economy
smaller than that of Wales.
Then on the home news pages, the FT ran a delightful joke item entitled
'Average family better off than a year ago'. If such a story had appeared in
the Daily Mail or the Daily Express one would have immediately known it was
invented for the benefit of the Conservative election campaign, but seeing
it in these unbiased pages, I experienced the brief frisson of falling for
it, before laughing incredulously - the essence of a good April Fool's joke.
But the FT's biggest prank - which ran through the entire paper -
unfortunately failed to come off.
On the back page it was revealed that the Bank of Japan had cut its official
discount rate to 3.75 per cent. On the front page it was stated that the US
Federal Reserve was discounting at 4 per cent. But right next to that true
fact the FT mischievously stated that the London Interbank lending rate was
11 per cent.
Eleven per cent, in the middle of a deep recession, while inflation is below
4 per cent and falling] That really is overdoing the spirit of April Fool's
Day, even for the new lively FT.
What the jokers who thought this spoof up had forgotten, is that humour must
be consistent. If our interest rate really were so grotesquely out of line
and at such wilfully damaging levels opposition politicians in an election
campaign would have been screaming for them to be brought down, and back
bench Conservative MPs would be demanding Norman Lamont's resignation.
Yet instead the FT gives the impression that in such an implausible
situation all the parties are agreed that the British economy should be
sacrificed on the altar of the United Germany's money supply figures. That
is taking an April Fool's joke too far.

FT  04 APR 92 / Arts: A likeable mishmash - Max Loppert on ENO's latest
production of Don Carlos
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAX LOPPERT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BEST thing about the English National Opera Don Carlos is its chosen
version. That may seem a flat compliment to pay an important new production;
but in the case of this opera - one of the supreme masterpieces of the
medium, but also one of the most textually complicated - the matter is in
fact of the highest importance. The care with which ENO has made its
editorial decisions indicates its approach to mounting the opera as a whole.
Don Carlos was written for Paris in 1867, then re - worked in stages over
the next two decades. The basic choices for modern performance are the
five-act 1867 original and the four-act 1883 four-act revision - but, since
Andrew Porter's early-1970s discovery in the Paris Opera archives of much
magnificent material cut before the 1867 first night, those choices have
become considerably less clearcut.
ENO has gone for an expanded 1867 text (but with several passages in their
1883 revised form), including therein several key Porter discoveries.
Notable among them are the full Fontainebleau choral opening, the exchange
of masks between Elisabeth and Eboli, and, best of all, the Philip - Carlos
prison duet (on a theme that Verdi re - used in his Requiem) followed by the
original Paris form of the insurrection scene.
I admire the spirit of seriousness in which conductor, Mark Elder, and
producer, David Pountney, have embarked on their presentation. No part of
the opera has, one feels, escaped hard scrutiny, no editorial decision
agreed without reasoned insight into character, situation and the opera's
larger themes. It makes for a long evening ' four-and-a-half hours with two
intervals ' but a gripping one.
The same spirit can be felt in the production choices. Pountney and the
designer, David Fielding, have devised a modern theatrical environment in
which Verdi's Grand Opera forms can seek out new resonances and
'relevances'. A clear distinction is drawn between decor (abstract
neo-surrealist) and costume (handsome period) styles. The stage-floor is set
aslant with coffins piling up beneath; bare walls catch fierce beams of
'psychological' lighting; props and hangings are shaped and placed in the
eye-teasing, sometimes strikingly beautiful ways familiar from more than one
Fielding-designed opera staging.
Similarly, a clear contrast has been calculated between visual and acting
styles. Behaviour, though not exactly observant of Spanish court etiquette
(in Act 4 the queen appears before the king dressed in only a white
nightdress), is not re-invented in parallel with the design. Indeed, touches
of surprisingly old-fashioned melodrama can be felt in the treatment of
Carlos (lots of head-holding and dropping to the floor) and Eboli (peals of
menacing laughter in the Act 3 trio). Old-fashioned opera-acting of the
better kind, sensitively felt, vigorously paced, marks the Fontainebleau
opening, Philip's study, Carlos's prison cell and the whole of the finale.
It is, in sum, an arresting, intelligent, committed production ' and, for my
taste, a fearful mishmash. It will surely be pounced on by foes of the ENO's
'interventionist' stagings of the past decade as the latest vehicle for a
heavy load of Coliseum cliches; the auto-da-feis certainly a Pountney
Special - an over-the-top riot of (historically accurate) carnival colours
and torture-and-burning details more appropriate to Bernstein's Candide
('What a day, what a day, For an auto-da-fe]') than Verdi's Don Carlos.
Thursday's performance found none of the participants at his or her best. Mr
Elder, a Don Carlos conductor of proven excellence, will no doubt regain
equilibrium and free himself from the tics of hustling the voices (choral as
well as solo) that so marred the first half of the evening. There were many
admirable features - expressive orchestral colours, rhythmic and
dramatically patterned - along the way to the sublime finale, but the
reading badly wanted the 'long line' of musical direction of which this
conductor has shown himself a master.
The cast is composed of prized ENO regulars - Edmund Barham (Carlos), Gwynne
Howell (Philip), Jonathan Summers (Posa), Linda Finnie (Eboli), Richard Van
Allan (Inquisitor) - and, as Elisabeth, Rosalind Plowright in her first ENO
appearance for eight years. Mr Summers, a bit rough - voiced at first, grew
to noble stature; he alone took continual care over line dynamics, a
'French' clarity of utterance consistent both with the work's origins and
with the tone of Porter's superb translation. Mr Howell, a dourly imposing
king, and Miss Finnie, a princess disappointingly coarsened since her 1985
ENO Eboli, too often substituted force for focus. Mr Barham rings out some
bravely heroic phrases - his top has developed a fine freedom - but
aristocratic style is not in his line.
Miss Plowright, tall, handsome, eloquent with eyes and long hands, offers a
contrastingly regal heroine. At first there was pleasure in hearing her back
in healthy vocal form, with velvety colour throughout the range; but high -
register strain crept in during through the long evening. Even so, on a
stage too often cluttered by sincere but unrealised production ambitions,
her Elisabeth and Mr Summers's Posa proved the figures who most regularly
engaged audience emotions.

FT  04 APR 92 / Arts: French flair at the fair
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Champs de Mars is the military soul of Paris, where Napoleon lies in
monumental splendour and, in Les Invalides, Louis XIV's grandest building
project in his capital, the wounded still parade the horrors of war.
For a few days in March the image strengthens with the appearance of tented
white pavilions on the greensward. Inside the tents a desperate campaign is
fought, with antique dealers trying to sell their stock to economically
shell-shocked collectors.
The Salon de Mars appeared four years ago as an attempt to liven up Paris's
art market in the long gap between the autumn Biennales. It quickly
established itself as an important date on the international art fair
calendar, attracting 115, mainly French, dealers this year, and 50,000
visitors.
Success has brought change. At the start the Salon was provocatively
original, with no nonsense about dates. Challenging contemporary art was
shown alongside re-assuring antiquities; solid 18th century French commodes
nestled with sinister items of tribal art. Now the extremes have been
subsumed inside a comprehensive art fair.
Some of the character has been lost, but the ingrained French feel for
style, for outward show, has been retained. The long arm of the interior
decorator might be sensed reaching down the avenues between the stands, but
it is decorators with taste rather than decorators with the ability to
persuade the rich to pay over the odds for kitsch.
Foreign dealers are slow to take up the Fair, but Michael Goedhuis of London
was happy enough, selling Dollars 100,000 of oriental works of art at the
opening party. The other London dealer showing for the first time,
Stoppenbach &amp; Delestre, was also pleased with its decision to bring home the
French artists it usually offers in Cork Street. It quickly sold views of
Paris by Harpignies.
The recession has split dealers in their attitude to fairs. Some wonder why
they bother to operate from expensive galleries; they could trade to their
traditional customers just as effectively from home, while meeting new
clients at fairs; others think fairs are just another expense in dreadful
times. But fairs get dealers out and about; expose them to the stock of
their competitors; and, in Paris at least, ensure a constant flow of
viewers. So far the trade in Paris has been less badly hit than in London,
and sales at the Salon while not brisk were certainly steady. The delegation
from the British Antique Dealers Association, there to pick up tips for its
own fair under canvas, planned for Chelsea in May 1993, was impressed.
So what caught the eye? As always the stands of Perrin and Segoura, two of
the handful of grandes antiquaires who set the standards in Paris, offered
18th century furniture, topped with clocks, porcelain, and indeed beds, all
unfussy but shrieking refined taste. Galerie Mechiche best summed up the
barrier-breaking tradition of the Salon by juxtaposing paintings by Balthus
and Tapies with Chinese pots dating back 4,000 years, Graeco-Roman
sculptures, and 18th century furniture bearing the stamp of Jacob. And it
all looked fine. Gisele Croes from Brussels stopped you in your tracks with
a collection of Chinese art, Tang figures, somehow enhanced by the loss of
their original paint, quiet, enduring symbols of a millenium and more ago.
The attraction of the Salon is that it welcomes bizarre dealers like
Gallerie Acteon, which offers 'art de la locomotion', scale models of boats,
cars and trains - and a full size papier-mache horse presumably used by an
artist painting Napoleon's generals. The drawback is that it is still French
centred; coming so soon after Maastricht many foreign dealers feel they
cannot exhibit at both. But the verdict this week was that demand had been
fair to good, especially where dealers had reduced prices. Now that the
Salon has built foundations it needs to bring in foreign galleries at the
expense of some of the more meretricious contemporary dealers.

FT  04 APR 92 / Arts: A troubled Winter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
With A Winter's Tale, one gets exactly what the title suggests: the play
starts with a brief shaft of pale sunlight, then gets steadily darker before
shifting to the bucolic and ending in reconciliation in the court of Sicily
where the tale began. It is one of the simplest of Shakespeare's plays, but
also one of the most satisfying, because the story is so good. It is a
tragi-comedy because although it has a happy ending, no-one can forget the
pain that has gone before. The Winter's Tale is a very good plot for an
opera.
The Theatre de Complicite, which, in spite of its name is British, is a
touring company that places heavy emphasis on training, research and the use
of theatre workshops. Its creative standards are high. The company has not
previously gone in for the classics, so one looked forward to this
production at the Lyric, Hammersmith with a mixture of pleasure, curiosity
and trepidation.
The result is a curate's egg. The company is too good not to produce
surprises and the odd stunning effect. On the other hand, The Winter's Tale
is too good a play to need tampering with. If it ain't broke, don't fix it.
The piece is described in the company's own summary as 'a violent nightmare
of jealousy, destruction and hatred that becomes the miracle of a waking
dream through the workings of the gods, Time, good fortune and great women'.
That is a reasonably accurate outline, and it is a passable joke that Time
should be represented as Time magazine. One's doubt is the feminist stress
on 'great women'. Some of the men, though of humbler origins, come out of
the play just as well as the girls.
Quite the best moment in Annabel Arden's direction comes when the old
shepherd emerges through the crackling storm, orders the sound effects to
stop and finds the infant Perdita abandoned on the shore. That is the signal
that the play falls into two parts and we know that we have moved into
calmer waters.
It is also the signal for the company changing gear and beginning to
embroider the text. The shepherd - well played by Kathryn Hunter, who has
four parts altogether - adds lines of his own. The rogue Autolycus is played
by Marcello Magni, one of the founders of the company. He speaks and sings
half his lines in Italian and conducts a wonderful flirtation with a lady in
the front row.
Nothing wrong with that - some of it is very funny - except that it does not
really fit with the playing of part one which has been faithful enough to
the text, but has been excessively violent.
One knows that Leontes is a dangerous man whose jealousy leads to terrible
consequences, yet I wonder if he has to be quite as physically brutal,
viciously kicking his servants and guards. That violence leaves a nasty
taste which never quite goes away. It should be sufficient to show it
through suggestion: the subtlety of the part is lost by being so explicit.
Better to play him as a tortured introvert than a brutish beast.
I should add that when he returns at the end, Leontes is a transformed
figure, an ageing man who movingly conveys his remorse. He is played by
Simon McBurney, another of the company's founders. It is a tribute to him
that I doubt if you would know without looking at the programme, that he
doubles as the shepherd's son. Technically, the company is very inventive.
The pity is that it has taken some of the beauty out of The Winter's Tale.
The Winter's Tale, Lyric, Hammersmith, until May 2. Sponsored by Beck's
Beer. Box Office 081 741 2311.

<TEXT>
EXPLETIVES DELETED by Angela Carter Chatto &amp; Windus Pounds 15.99, 228 pages
'A DAY without an argument is like an egg without salt', writes Angela
Carter in the introduction to what she surely knew was likely to be a
posthumous collection of her essays.
That savoury uncomplicated prose, always bristling for a fight yet just as
ready to praise and celebrate, could turn its attention to anything from
sociology to Salinger, Fielding to fetishes. The mind was always open, so
unblinking and unafraid.
A decade ago Virago published Nothing Sacred, an anthology of Carter's
journalism drawn largely from her columns for New Society. Book reviews
occupied a relatively minor place in that scheme; they dominate Expletives
Deleted.
Each of its five sections is triggered by books, by no means all of them
novels, leading off into discursions upon food, London, Amerika (the
Kafkaesque k is obligatory) and gender, out of which comes a torrent of
ideas and images, all jostling for intellectual space.
The cultural range is bracingly wide, and the juxtapositions it generates
sometimes startling. So Milorad Pavic's Dictionary of the Khazars is 'In
culinary terms neither tofuburger nor Big Mac, but a Chinese banquet, a
multiplicity of short narrative and prose fragments . . . In other words it
is not like a novel by Penelope Lively.'
Pavic's singular achievement is extolled by Carter as 'a novel without any
sense of closure, the product of a vast generosity of the imagination', and
it crystallises one of the main themes in her writing on fiction - how
writers at the end of the 20th century are to come to terms with the
problems of narrative continuity and open up the form to modes of writing
that are neither linear nor self-contained.
Hence, on one level, Carter's fascination with the folk tradition (in this
collection she takes in both Irish folk tales and the German legends of the
brothers Grimm); hence too her admiration for John Berger and William
Burroughs, even Christina Stead, and her unalloyed delight in the
realisation that with Empire of the Sun J. G. Ballard was likely to (and
did) receive the popular acclaim he had already richly earned in his less
vaunted science fiction writings.
But her sympathies could be engaged by so many other qualities: by
extravagance or formal elegance, surreal fantasy or stark realism. She
abhorred snobbery and (particularly male) pretension; there is here a
double-pronged attack on Elizabeth David and a savage dismissal of Paul
Theroux's My Secret History, alongside extravagant (to me) praise of Michael
Moorcock and of Grace Paley, which cannot avoid a glancing piece of
unashamed malice - 'I love to think how Joan Didion would hate Grace Paley'.
She is wonderfully, truthfully ambivalent too about the US. 'I think of the
United States with awe and sadness, that the country has never, ever quite
reneged on the beautiful promise inscribed on the Statue of Liberty . . .
and yet has fucked so much up'. Her transatlantic tour takes in Robert
Coover, Louis Erdrich and Edmund White, together with Hollywood and comic
strips; it constitutes, she suggests, the richest repository of contemporary
myths, of tangled dreams and disappointments.
Expletives Deleted ends with a piece of reportage - Carter's impressions of
James Joyce's Dublin 78 years on, chosen as an envoi because 'for any writer
in the English language the twentieth century starts on 16 June 1904,
Bloomsday, and shows no sign of ending yet'.
It has ended, alas, for Angela Carter, who died on February 16. We will miss
her most for her fiction, a loss sharpened by the knowledge that her final
novel Wise Children was one of her best. But also, as this collection
demonstrates, we should cherish what we have of her piercing honesty, lack
of pretension and sheer bloody-mindedness.

AUGUSTUS REX by Clive Sinclair Andre Deutsch Pounds 13.99, 210 pages
THIRST by Stephen Amidon Bloomsbury Pounds 15.99, 219 pages
EMMA SMART by Jonathan Treitel Bloomsbury Pounds 15.99, 277 pages
THE MAN WHO FELL IN LOVE WITH THE MOON by Tom Spanbauer Secker &amp; Warburg
Pounds 8.99, 400 pages
TAKE a deep breath before you consider the plot of Clive Sinclair's new
novel, Augustus Rex. A very deep breath. What it needs from the reader is a
willing suspension of disbelief, a readiness to meet the author halfway -
perhaps more than halfway.
Grant him that much - and then brace yourself for a story in which August
Strindberg, the Swedish playwright, did not die in 1912 as popularly
supposed. Instead, he sold his soul to the Devil and was kept in suspended
animation until 1961, when he rose again to become a powerful man and
vigorous lover, the eponymous Rex of the title.
He is tempted by the Devil on the way, first with a sexy Jewish landlady
(Strindberg was notoriously anti-Semitic) and then with his coronation in
the ancient field where the Swedes traditionally elected their monarchs. He
looks for the elixir of life, attempts to turn urine into gold, and aspires
to win the Nobel prize.
Not surprisingly, perhaps, he goes mad instead and ends up wandering around
Sweden for seven years before turning into a fly and buzzing round the
sexual organs of his wife as she makes love to another man.
Weird? All Clive Sinclair's stuff is weird. He has always been an offbeat
writer with a quirky way of looking at the world that is entirely his own. A
cerebral writer, too: very whimsical and interested as much in the
exploration of ideas as the simple mechanics of the plot. You either like
his kind of writing or you don't; but whatever else you can say about him,
he is always lucid, always original, never dull.
Far more straightforward as a writer is Stephen Amidon, an American living
in England. For the hero of his second novel, Thirst, he has chosen an
American living in . . . England. The resemblance ends there, however,
because Daniel North is an actor and in no way an alter ego for the author.
He is at Heathrow airport when the novel begins, waiting to meet his father
whom he has not seen for 13 acrimonious years. But his hopes for a
reconciliation are dashed when North senior has a heart attack on the plane
and arrives in London stone dead.
Undaunted, Daniel accompanies the body back to Arizona, where he delivers it
to a stepmother his own age and meets his half-brother for the first time.
He also meets his father's former employer, a shady businessman selling
water rights to beat the drought. Was Daniel's father involved in criminal
activity - something to do with wells drying up and illicit deals on the
Salt Indian reservation? Daniel resolves to find out.
He takes a job to pay his way, playing the part of an Indian murder victim
in the Arizona equivalent of Crimewatch UK. Then, by chance, he discovers
that the victim's name was on a list in his father's possession. What
possible connection could there be between his father and a headless Indian
found in a canal?
Not what you might think, because Amidon is too good a writer for that. He
handles his story with great verve, never showing his hand, always keeping
the reader guessing. There is a hint of Chinatown in the plot and a nod,
perhaps, to the American Indian novels of Tony Hillerman. If there is a
complaint, it is that Daniel's behaviour at the denouement seems a little
out of character; not at all what you might expect. But that is only a minor
quibble in an otherwise neatly-executed book.
Jonathan Treitel's Emma Smart is a modern equivalent of Jane Austen's Emma.
A Cambridge mathematician is enjoying a year's sabbatical at the Institute
of Advanced Studies in New York. She was a child prodigy at Cambridge: only
11 when she went up. Ten years later, she is an adult at last, but still a
virgin and happy to remain so.
In New York, she is befriended by an old university chum, who introduces her
to LZ Allgrobsch, an enigmatic novelist and Nobel laureate from central
Europe. Her friend wants to write Allgrobsch's biography, but is having
trouble researching his early life. Emma offers to help, with intriguing
results.
Treitel cheerfully acknowledges his debt to Jane Austen and tells an
intellectual story in best academic manner, although one must quarrel with
him about the existence of a McDonald's in Cambridge - it is the one example
of American cultural imperialism that has not so far been permitted in the
town.
The Man Who Fell In Love With The Moon is another very American creation,
the product of the Columbia fiction programme and of 68 assistants thanked
individually in the foreword ('Bless your hearts, you guys'). It begins
dreadfully in an arch, approved writing school manner that clearly is aiming
at Literature, if not High Art. Once the author settles down, though, his
story gradually develops a certain peculiar charm of its own.
It is about a half-Red Indian boy, working as a male prostitute in Idaho at
the turn of the century and desperately looking for his parents. At one
point he has sex willingly with the man he believes to be his father, which
seems to be par for the course in American novels these days. He identifies
his parents in the end, although not before he has tried every kind of
sexual combination you can think of, and one or two you almost certainly
can't.

JUDAISM by Hans Kung SCM Press Pounds 35, 753 pages
THE CRUCIFIED JEW by Dan Cohn-Sherbok HarperCollins Pounds 17.95, 258 pages
HANS KUNG has set himself the ambitious but almost certainly impossible task
of reconciling the three great faiths which claim descent from Abraham:
Judaism, Christianity and Islam. His slogan is, 'no peace among the nations
without peace among the religions; no peace among the religions without
dialogue between the religions; no dialogue between the religions without
investigation of the foundation of the religions.' This book is the opening
of the campaign: it is the first in a trilogy of investigations, the others
will deal with Islam and Christianity.
Kung aims to discuss the history and theology of Judaism, the
Jewish-Christian and Jewish-Muslim relationships, the Holocaust, and the
founding and future of Israel.
There is much that is fascinating in this massive study, particularly Kung's
synoptic view of Judaism's evolution from its disparate originating
theologies and tribal traditions. In this regard the fact that Kung has an
outsider's view enhances rather than detracts.
Some of the historical judgments invite dispute. Kung dates Christian
anti-semitism to the 11th century, when a rumour swept Europe that the Jews
had warned Sultan al-Hakim of Egypt that the Christians would conquer his
empire unless he destroyed the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem. In
the resulting Crusades, Jew and Moslem were together perceived as enemies,
Kung says, making inevitable the anti-Jewish Constitutions of Pope Innocent
III.
But Christian anti-semitism is far older than this; Kung seems to forget
Augustine's Tract Against the Jews and other Patristic attacks, and takes
barely any note of the anti-semitism in the New Testament itself. On these
topics Dan Cohn-Sherbok's account is more persuasive and complete.
When it comes to the Holocaust, Kung's analysis is unblinking. Neither the
importance nor the horror of the event can be underestimated, he argues, but
nor can it be detached from its historical context and treated as an
'absolute', for it lies squarely in the framework of German and human
history, and can only be understood in terms of it. Cohn-Sherbok agrees with
this view. But Kung argues also that Jewish politicians and thinkers should
resist the temptation to use the Holocaust as a premiss in all contemporary
arguments, especially in connection with current Middle Eastern questions,
because without a fresh beginning based on reconciliation there can be no
prospect for peace.
In his different, less didactic but angrier account of anti-semitism through
history, Cohn-Sherbok paints a bleak, troubling portrait of inhumanity and
suffering, a portrait in which few escape the shame of prejudice - even
those Enlightenment heroes, such as Voltaire, whom one would dearly wish to
see otherwise. Both practising and nominal Christians too conveniently
ignore this side of their history.
Cohn-Sherbok claims that the Holocaust was inevitable because of the long
history of anti-semitism which preceded it, beginning in pagan times and
gathering force as Christianity's dominance grew. There is no doubt that
anti-semitism is the blackest aspect of Christianity's anyway dismal record,
and it is only because there is such a tradition that it was so
frighteningly easy for the Nazis first to scapegoat the Jews and later
nearly to succeed in their hideous 'Final Solution'. But judgments of
inevitability are hard to assess; too much else conspired to make Hitler
possible. Some of what he says is utterly convincing: anti-semitism is
resurfacing in Europe, and his book is timely, because it warns that if we
do not see clearly, and resist strongly, there is no saying where the
revivals of nationalism, racism and anti-semitism might end.
Both books are required reading. At least two of Kung's aims might be
achieved if they were widely read: an increase of understanding of Judaism
among non-Jews, and a resolve to forbid a terrible chapter of history
repeating itself.

MY FALKLAND DAYS by Rex Hunt David &amp; Charles Pounds 18.99, 488 pages
TEN years ago, commanders of the Argentine troops invading the Falklands
encountered Sir Rex Hunt, then governor of the islands, dressed in full
Colonial Office regalia which included a plumed hat. One of the commanders
was to reprimand Sir Rex for behaving 'very ungentlemanly' by refusing to
shake his hand. Sir Rex retorted: 'It is very uncivilised of you to invade
my country.'
With few exceptions, Argentina's military men had little time for Sir Rex.
The junta, conveniently forgetting their own illusions of grandeur, claimed
that Sir Rex was arrogant and self-deluded and a personification of
colonialism which the world could well do without. It was a view shared by
some Foreign Office mandarins - although certainly not by all - who thought
such lingering relics of empire were out of step with the subtle diplomatic
priorities of Britain's changing role in the world.
Yet the islanders consider Sir Rex a hero for defending their wishes not to
belong to Argentina during the 1970s. It was a decade when most British
ministers seemed prepared to sell them down the River Plate, or at the very
least give Buenos Aires such ambiguous signals as to make invasion a
plausible option.
In June the islanders will welcome Sir Rex back, with Mrs Thatcher, to
celebrate their liberation. The colonial regalia may have been retired to
the Imperial War Museum, but islanders say they are even more British today.
Sir Rex, now retired and living in Berkshire, belonged to a dying breed of
British Crown servants who found himself in the eye of a political storm
more by accident than design. He was appointed Governor of the Falklands in
1979 following a decade when the Colonial Office to which he belonged had
gradually been subsumed in the Foreign Office.
In the Falklands, as in other islands such as St Helena and Mauritius, the
old colonial functions had survived with grandiose titles. In practice,
however, the individuals who occupied them were second division players in a
foreign service which had more use for diplomats than administrators.
Sir Rex was a veteran of several postings in Africa and Asia. He considered
he had reached the pinnacle of his career with his appointment to the
Falklands. 'How ironic, I thought . . . to be responsible for fewer people
than at the start, when, as Assistant District Commissioner in Uganda, I had
been responsible for 100,000 souls.' It was, as he notes, a reflection on
the decline of the British Empire over the same period.
Briefly, during the Falklands war, people such as Sir Rex may have been
forgiven for believing that such a trend was being reversed. The sending of
the naval Task Force, to the strains of Rule Britannia, brought tears to
those unused to accepting the UK reduction in status.
But Sir Rex did not have a very good war at all. Booted out of Las Malvinas
by Generals Menendez and Company after nearly getting his head blown off,
Sir Rex arrived at the British Embassy in Montevideo to be telephoned by Mrs
Thatcher. Why, he was asked, had he not sent word to London when the
Argentines arrived on the Falklands?
In fact Sir Rex had done a pretty good job of holding island morale together
against enormous odds. While Whitehall was huffing and puffing about what to
do next, it was Sir Rex and a small band of Marines who put up a brief but
defiant last-stand against thousands of invading forces.
But Mrs Thatcher's question must have been a hint of what was to come.
Number 10, the intelligence services, the Foreign Office and the Ministry of
Defence would try hard to find someone to blame for Britain's failure to
anticipate Argentina's intentions sooner. On returning to the UK, Sir Rex
offered his services as part of the war effort. The day he volunteered for
duty at the Foreign Office, he was stopped at the entrance because he did
not have the necessary pass.
It is a pity that Sir Rex has not allowed chagrin to translate itself into a
little rebellion against his former employers. The manuscript of his memoirs
was submitted to the Foreign Office for pre-censorship.
I wonder, for instance, if there might not be a better explanation as to why
the small band of British Marines who were stationed on the islands on April
2 1982 did not escape to the hills rather than surrender to the Argentines?
The Marines knew the territory rather better than the Argentines and could
have carried out an effective guerrilla operation. It was the kind of heroic
exercise Sir Rex would have approved of, but then he was never really in
charge. In the end it was Mrs Thatcher who took the credit, however briefly,
for the 'Falklands spirit' of renewed national pride.
Michael Joseph has re-issued The Battle for the Falklands (Pounds 25, 384
pp.) by Max Hastings and Simon Jenkins, first published in 1983.

PROOFS AND THREE PARABLES by George Steiner Faber &amp; Faber Pounds 5.99, 114
pages
GEORGE STEINER is writing fiction again. How can one tell? Because this
resembles everything else he writes: serious opinions trenchantly put. His
thin new volume, Proofs and Three Parables, advances his slowly accreted
critical thinking; these four stories are not narrative romps but allegories
for argument and scripts for thought.
Steiner believes that honest literary criticism is a passionate private
experience seeking to persuade, and that its professional versions have
about them neither rigour nor proof. His own criticism is everywhere driven
by a strident liberalism which rightly refuses to forget the Holocaust.
After Treblinka, when God is a shout in the street, criticism can do no
better than remember.
His brilliant Death of Tragedy (1961) stopped short, after elegant
discussions of Corneille, Holderlin and the Greeks. On a train in Poland,
Steiner hears of Russian officer prisoners eaten alive by the starved guard
dogs of a retreating German army, the survivors shot by the liberating
Russians lest the ranks see the abjection of their commanders; a woman tells
of her sister in the Matthausen death-camp, but, says Steiner 'I will not
set it down here, for it is the kind of thing under which language breaks.'
With such knowledge, Steiner can write fiction in Proofs and Three Parables
only by making it continuous with his politics. On May Day, 1981, Steiner
lectured at Christ's College, Cambridge and punningly predicted the decline
of Communism in Europe: then, May Day ('m'aider') was a cry for help. Now in
'Proofs', another cry: the 'Professore', a Marxist proof reader in Italy
faces the collapse of messianic Marxism.
This collapse tests the Western idealist more stringently than the Eastern
pragmatist. Steiner works the problem through with long speeches from the
Professore's reading-group in Marxist Revolutionary Theory and Praxis, and
with the pointed allegory of failing eyesight (the Professore's left eye
ceases to function). Soon, the Marxist group disintegrates: what then is to
be done? The Professore joins the Communist Party, the PCI, only to discover
that it has become the Party of the Democratic Left.
The other stories include a bizarre version of Desert Island Discs and the
volume concludes with a religious debate, 'Conversation Piece': how could
God ask such a thing of Abraham? What did Sarah know? Can God play jokes?
And why do men argue over scriptural authority?
Proofs and Three Parables is not Steiner at his pellucid best, but if it
sends one back to reread Language and Silence or In Bluebeard's Castle then
it will have done enough.

FT  04 APR 92 / Books: England's golden age: when life was a riot - Mark
Archer on a study of violence in the Hanoverian century
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
RIOTS, RISINGS AND REVOLUTION by Ian Gilmour Hutchinson Pounds 25, 504 pages
'VERY GREAT Rebellion in France': Parson Woodforde's diary entry on the fall
of the Bastille, almost overlooked between remarks about Somerset's bad
weather and the purchase of a fine crab for one shilling, has long seemed to
sum up the spirit of self-contented repose which settled over England during
the Hanoverian Age.
In reality, as Ian Gilmour's fascinating study shows - it is subtitled
Governance and Violence in 18th Century England - the kingdom was deeply
divided; riots over politics, food and religion were endemic.
The realm was twice threatened by Jacobite rebellions, in 1715 and 1745,
while the Gordon Riots in 1780 came close to toppling the state. In spite of
the relative liberty of English institutions, the English penal code was the
harshest in Europe. Stealing a handkerchief, consorting with gypsies and
cutting down growing trees were among 200 capital offences. A 'multitude of
unhappy wretches,' Mandeville wrote in 1725, 'every year are put to death
for trifles.' Government was notorious for place-trading and corruption.
Violence was a fundamental fact of life. 'In the 18th century few people
disapproved of violence as such; the cause or the objective of the riot
determined for the majority the view they took of it.'
The quality and the mob were not two classes but the same people. When Pitt
received the Freedom of the City of London, members of Brooks's set about
his coach with bludgeons, wrecking it and injuring his servants.
Indeed, Gilmour argues that the liberty allowed to violence, especially mob
rule, was essential to keeping the institutions of King, Lords and Commons
in balance. Faced with the institutionalised violence of the press-gang,
game laws and the harsh preponderance of capital offences in favour of
property, the mob's violence was seldom against persons and generally
inspired by a perceived injustice.
Gilmour's heroes are easy to spot: Burke, for one, who disagreed with those
who were 'against disturbing the public repose; I like a clamour whenever
there is an abuse. The fire-bell at midnight disturbs your repose, but it
keeps you from being burned in your bed', and Wilkes.
'In the 18th century two strands of protest can be differentiated although
they occasionally intermingled: one, which ran from the Sacheverell riots to
the Jewish Naturalisation Bill to the Gordon Riots, was the producer and
product of prejudice and fanaticism; it served no useful purpose. The other,
which ran through many food riots, the turnpike riots, some of the election
riots and the Wilkite disturbances, had a strong feeling for law and custom
and was seeking to make the authorities do their job or to reform them;
often its violence was almost non-violent, and it was usually salutary.'
In a short review it is difficult to do justice to the scope and
intelligence of this marvellous account of a much misunderstood age. It is
old-fashioned history-writing at its best, full of incident, personalities
and intriguing facts.
One moment we are with Lord Gordon on the Commons balcony, giving the crowd
bulletins about the debate inside ('Lord North calls you a mob]'), the next
we are in the midst of a fascinating aside on duelling, its characters ('of
the 14 Prime Ministers between 1779 and the repeal of the Corn Laws, six -
Shelburne, Fox, Pitt, Canning, Wellington and Peel - fought or tried to
fight a duel') and its pretexts ('Lord Falkland was killed because when
drunk he said to Mr Powell, who was also drunk, 'What, drunk again tonight,
Pogey?'').
Analysing the 1715 and '45 rebellions Gilmour shows how the English
Jacobites preferred toasting their king across the water to risking
violence. And like the best histories, Gilmour's is full of tantalising
'what might have beens': 'If the Jacobite invasion had occurred in 1740-41,
after two very bad harvests and with Walpole still in power, it would
probably have been far better received; by 1745 Walpole was gone, and the
last four harvests had all been good.'
Disraeli's verdict on the 18th-century was that 'a people without power or
education had been induced to believe themselves the freest and most
enlightened nation in the world.' According to Gilmour, this could not have
been achieved without the safety-valve of violence. The patriotic pride of
18th-century country parsons, though justified, rested on a paradox.

exhibition which opened in London this week
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
ON THE morning of August 24 in 79 AD, Mount Vesuvius erupted. Pliny the
Younger, living in nearby Misenum, left a harrowing account of the awful
darkness that 'came rolling over the land after us like a torrent'.
Hit by showers of volcanic debris, earthquakes and asphyxiating gases,
Pompeii, together with Oplontis and Stabiae to the east, were submerged
under pumice-stone and ash. To the west, Herculaneum was engulfed by
volcanic mud that solidified to form a stone cover 10 metres thick.
These provincial coastal towns and cities of the Roman empire were
transfixed in the first century. They remained more or less undisturbed
until 1709 when a chance discovery in Herculaneum prompted the Bourbon kings
of Naples to start excavations to recover antique sculpture to adorn their
palaces.
When Goethe visited Pompeii and Herculaneum, the passages dug by the Bourbon
miners could be explored by lamplight, and the discoveries made there were
fuelling neo-classicism. Goethe wrote in 1787: 'Many a calamity has happened
in the world, but never one that has caused so much entertainment to
posterity as this one.'
Archaeological research, restoration and maintenance at the Vesuvian sites
had been in decline since the 1950s. Walls were crumbling and wall paintings
deteriorating. The sites would have deteriorated further if an earthquake in
1980 had not jolted the Italian government into action.
In 1981, an special archaeological administration was instituted for the
Pompeii area. By 1984, it had substantial - although still insufficient -
funds and an energetic soprintendente in Professor Baldassare Conticello. He
has masterminded what he describes as a new philosophy for Pompeii; it
involves the collaboration of archaeologists, geologists, biologists,
botanists, geotechnicians, physicists and even a climatologist.
The bonus of computer expertise came when IBM Italy and Fiat Engineering
joined forces in 1987-89 to form the Neapolis consortium. It transformed the
project by setting up one of the largest ever information technology systems
for archaeology, to address the task of preserving, restoring and
interpreting Pompeii.
First, the whole 140 square-mile area was electronically mapped, to produce
a grid on to which other data could be added. That information included over
12,000 catalogue entries of individual finds, and over 8,700 digitised
colour images of wall paintings, mosaics and artefacts - thus preserving,
electronically at least, Pompeii's most fugitive and precious treasures for
posterity. Excavation notebooks dating back to 1862 were committed to disk
and, like the Herculaneum papyri, made more legible on the computer screen
in the process.
Imaging techniques were developed to simulate restoration of damaged wall
paintings, allowing restorers to experiment without touching the frescoes
themselves. Data on the function of each building has shed light on
Pompeii's ancient social, political, religious and commercial life. At the
touch of a button, the computer reveals, for example, the existence and
whereabouts of a red light district, the distribution of shops and
workshops, or even take-aways.
On site meanwhile, Conticello inaugurated a systematic restoration of
Pompeii from east to west, further excavations and a new museum. A series of
publications, exhibitions and concerts raised awareness of the area and
brought more visitors and, with them, public funding. Publishing the finds
has also protected them. The entire collection of bronze and gold stolen
from the deposit at Herculaneum in 1990 was recovered last November, because
thieves were unable to find a buyer.
The most ambitious and critical consciousness-raising exercise to date is
the spectacular travelling exhibition, 'Rediscovering Pompeii'. It comes at
a time when digging has stopped and the computer is silent, awaiting a
second phase of funding. The show features 200 treasures and artefacts -
some only recently brought to light - and demonstrates the role of the
Neapolis technology in making the classical world more accessible. After
showing at New York, Houston (where is attracted over 350,000 visitors) and
Malmo, it opened in London at the Accademia Italiana this week.
Ironically, the disaster that totally extinguished life in two days and two
nights in the first century also ensured a kind of immortality. Voices
resound in streets, houses, baths and open public spaces. Graffiti and
inscriptions record sporting triumphs and forthcoming fights, political
propaganda, and fierce expressions of love, hate and undying friendship.
Casts made from the cavities left by the fugitive Pompeiians make for
chilling death masks.
Most poignant are those of a family found sheltering in its home. Recently
excavated just outside Pompeii's city walls, they show a man raised up on
his elbow to shoulder the roof timber that has fallen, cupping his hands to
cover the nose and mouth of his pregnant wife beside him.
In the exhibition, we find the highly defined contours of a lady from
Oplontis who took flight clutching a purse full of coins, rings and gems.
That little purse, and other items such as bone dice, a bronze colander,
bowls of carbonised olives, figs and prunes, speak as eloquently as any fine
marble, bronze or mosaic.
A surprising amount survives of gardens as well as houses. Botanists working
on the recent excavation of the House of the Chaste Lovers at Pompeii have
been able to determine the precise layout and planting (through pollens,
seeds and roots) of its formal inner garden. In time this will be
reconstructed; meanwhile a larger programme of replanting is under way. The
Pompeiian love of greenery is most vividly apparent in the enchanting
frescos of a recently excavated garden room that form the centrepiece of the
show, richly adorned with luxuriant naturalistic flora and fauna.
Pompeii was a thriving commercial city. Oplontis and Herculaneum, in
contrast, were graced by the villas of the rich. The former boasts the only
surviving ancient wooden furniture (patterned by elaborate geometric
marquetry), and the fine wall painting at the supremely elegant villa
thought to have belonged to Nero's second wife Poppea. A sequence of
open-air rooms, frescoed with abundant foliage and lined with flower beds,
eases the transition between garden and house.
The garden of Herculaneum's grand Villa of the Stags has supplied much of
the finest marble statuary in the show. Its 'Drunken Hercules' is
characteristic in its robust earthiness. This Hercules is no conventional
hero. He is portrayed peeing, legs spread wide in a desperate attempt to
remain vertical.
'Rediscovering Pompeii', Accademia Italiana, 24 Rutland Gate, London SW7,
until June 21. Sponsored by IBM UK.

BRIAN McMaster is a mild mannered chap and did not complain publicly when he
opened the box in the director's office at the Edinburgh Festival and found
he had inherited a deficit of Pounds 170,000, and not a booking in sight for
the 1992 Festival.
McMaster, coming from Welsh National Opera, expects to plan two or three
years ahead, so will not make his mark until 1993 at the earliest. In the
meantime he has conjured up a patchwork programme for this summer's
Festival, with lashings of Tchaikovsky, the innovation of retrospectives -
of the plays of Granville Barker and CP Taylor, and a few plums.
The most eye-catching is the return of Pina Bausch after 10 years. The most
ear arresting is likely to be Elisabeth Soderstrom appearing in Poulenc's
opera for solo voice, La Voix Humaine. This is a brave undertaking for a
65-year-old, but apparently there is only one note in the piece that the
Swedish soprano views as her Beecher's Brook.
* Blinds should have been lowered in Bond Street galleries this week to mark
the passing of one of their best customers, Lord Spencer. The British
aristocracy stopped collecting art more than a century ago, but Lord Spencer
was constantly popping into leading picture dealers, happily disposing of
works by van Dyck, Salvator Rosa, Guercino and the like, while Lady Spencer
was busy at Partridges buying up 18th century furniture in order to
re-decorate Althorp to her brilliant taste.
So keen was she on gold that she had a plain 18th century suite gilded by
Partridge and paid for it by handing over another suite of furniture so good
that the dealers sold it on to the V &amp; A.
The Spencers used dealers because they did not want to be seen to be selling
off the family treasures publicly at auction, although numerous minor
pictures were discreetly unloaded through the salerooms, to the great
delight of sharp eyed dealers, well aware that a Spencer provenance would
ensure an easy sale.
Sometimes the Spencers sold short the family name. Wildenstein picked up a
Salvator Rosa for about Pounds 60,000 and sold it on to the National Gallery
in 1982 for Pounds 350,000. American museums, such as the Getty, were happy
to pay Colnaghi's well for the five Van Dycks that it dispersed from
Althorp. In all around Pounds 4m was raised from the sales, with most of it
going to shore up the ancestral home and to build modern beach bungalows in
Bognor.
* It is possible the new Earl, faced with a considerable tax bill, will be
forced against his will to dispose of more of the Spencer collection. He
will be encouraged by the Pounds 10m that Lord Cholomondeley received this
week from the National Gallery in return for his Holbein. In fact this was a
deal that satisfied both parties. The market value of the Holbein was
probably nearer Pounds 15m, but because of a double tax burden the Marquess
would have needed a price of around Pounds 28m from the proposed auction at
Christie's to net the equivalent of the Pounds 10m. No one expected such a
sum, which would have been a record for any Old Master, to be achieved in
the current world economic climate.
* Wolfgang Fischer, one of the leading London dealers in 20th century art,
has joined the bandwagon and closed down his King Street gallery rather than
pay a higher rent in these difficult trading times. Like Kasmin, Max
Rutherston, Nicola Jacobs, and Michael Goedhuis he prefers to operate from
home.
But it is not all gloom and doom. On Election, Day Noel Oddy opens a gallery
inside Patisserie Valerie, in the Brompton Road, offering, as well as cakes,
works on paper by the current and former Presidents of the RA, Sir Roger de
Grey and Sir Hugh Casson, John Bratby, Frederick Gore and others.
This is part of a trend - mixing art and food. The Eagle gallery in
Farringdon Road has firmly established itself this year above one of
London's more fashionable pubs, where an exhibition by Bernadette Kerr opens
on Thursday, and Drones, the well established eatery of the rich and famous,
now covers its walls with saleable art from young graduates at London's top
art schools.
Other London galleries are going overseas to drum up custom. The last time
Colnaghi operated in Paris was just before the Revolution, when the Italian
founder of the firm had to leave pretty sharply. Now the Bond Street dealer
is returning, opening up an office next month in the Faubourg St Honore,
which positively bristles with glitzy dealers.
The gallery is in the former disco of the ultra chic Hotel Bristol. Hardly
by chance the Bristol is owned by the German food billionaire, Rudolf Oetker
who also owns Colnaghi. For the first year it will act as a representative
office, offering French and Italian paintings. Given the remarkable shortage
of top Old Master dealers in Paris it should do well.
Another London dealer, Hazlett, Gooden &amp; Fox, has no complaints about
opening in Manhattan earlier this year. It sold two important paintings at
its first show.

CLASSIC English novels, often more talked about than read, are great
material for Radio 4's Saturday evenings (and Friday afternoon repeats).
Lately, we had a splendid Mill on the Floss; this week we embark on Hardy's
Tess of the D'Urbervilles, in a compact three-part adaptation by Sally
Hedges.
It starts with a brew of Angel Clare's association with Tess, wisely hinting
at what is to come, for Angel is mostly off-stage in the first episode, and
we must know him when he comes. But from the village song and dance onward,
we stay well enough with the tale - Durbeyfield's fancied connection with
the gentry, Tess's encounter with Alec D'Urberville after her accident on
the road to Casterbridge, her fatal seduction, the midnight baptism and
death of her baby. Now she has just begun as a dairymaid. Nigel Bryant's
direction is lively, with Hardy-style music. Carolyn Backhouse's Tess, 'a
pure woman', as Hardy insisted, has an apt pastoral voice with no excess of
West Country vowels, and Michael Lumsden's Alec is a seemingly decent young
country chap.
Assassins, the Monday play, was not Stephen Sondheim's musical about the
shooting of American Presidents, but an adventurous account by Peter Roberts
of what became of the knights who murdered Thomas Becket. De Traci ended as
an official in Henry II's court, the other three went on a penitential
crusade to Jerusalem. FitzUrse quit and took to trading in Brindisi; Brito
was killed by the Saracens; de Morville, in a less vigorous conclusion,
returned to Canterbury to seek forgiveness. Direction by Nigel Bryant again,
packed with action from the close-up of the murder to the quieter coda in
the Cathedral. But I'm afraid I can't believe in 12th-century knights who
say 'Excommunication means sod-all these days', though this may truthfully
express their thoughts.
While news-bulletins are crammed with election talk, and Radio 4 has six or
seven election features a day if you use both FM and LW, we may perhaps be
thankful that the network's other features have been kept free of any
potential politics. This week's Europhile (Sunday, repeated from Friday)
dealt only with Polish nobility in Krakow, over-taxed pensioners in Denmark,
and football in Albania. There was a heartbreaking account in The Cutting
Edge on Wednesday of a woman totally paralysed for seven years, fed only
through a naso-gastric tube; but we were not told whether she was nursed by
the NHS or privately. In the latest (and last) series of King Street Junior,
there was complaint about the shortage of school books, but the staff set
about correcting this themselves. No trouble with the buildings yet, either.
The Politics of Choice, Radio 4's novel presentation of current political
obsessions without politicians, seems rather a miss. The dodge is to contact
listeners about their particular concerns - last Tuesday, the environment,
though it boiled down to roads and railways - and have the problems answered
by lay experts. The effect is Any Questions without the stars.

FT  04 APR 92 / Arts: Women's night - Video
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIGEL ANDREWS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ENTIRE video industry must have been reading this monthly column. In
February I pointed out how male-dominated the new releases were. What should
March bring but an Amazonian army of screen heroines?
Here they are flexing their acting muscles in such films as Meeting Venus
(Warners) and Alice (RCA/Columbia), Blue Steel and The Whales Of August
(both 1st Independent), Broken Blossoms (Thames Silents) and Stepping Out
(CIC). The cinema is often accused of failing to provide women with good
roles and then paying them pittances when they do. Guilty as charged in the
second instance. Less and less so in the first.
When do men ever get roles as succulently emotional as Anjelica Huston's in
The Dead (1st Independent) and Glenn Close's in Meeting Venus? Huston keens
and croons through her father John's adaptation of James Joyce's tale of
family life and frail mortality. And as an impassioned, capricious opera
singer Miss Close coolly vaults or bestrides every fault-line in Istvan
Szabo's comedy-parable about disunited cultures in a 'united' Europe.
Just as sopranos sing the true tearaway stuff in opera, and ballerinas soar
in dance while men act as hydraulic cranes, so women get the free-flying
emotional franchise in movies. Newly issued is perhaps the greatest screen
performance by an actress, that of Lillian Gish in DW Griffith's 1918 Broken
Blossoms (Thames Silents). We are in London's East End and frightful things
are happening in pubs, opium dens and the like. Miss G plays a
neo-Dickensian waif with the largest eyes you ever saw: they show more human
drama than the whole of the rest of the screen.
Miss G, still alive today at ninetysomething, floats majestically through a
reissued The Whales Of August. Bette Davis, who owns the second largest pair
of eyes in showbiz, partners her in a film demonstrating what women can do
and men cannot. They can create a comprehensive human comedy from seeming to
do absolutely nothing (something which society has condemned them to do for
centuries). The drama is all in tiny gestures of lips or eyes, in words that
cunningly, ambivalently conceal or reveal.
Of course when women are allowed to do something, they do it with the
un-dammed energy of frustrated aeons. Liza Minnelli is preposterous and
irresistible in Stepping Out, as a dancing teacher shepherding a group of
amateur hoofers through rehearsals for a charity concert. Miss M behaves
like a sack of fireworks that has been left near a fire. Whenever you think
she is dormant, another sparkler or Roman candle goes up. She struts,
smiles, flounces, sings, dances, giggles and blazes her pixie eyes. If a man
did all this in an acting performance he would be escorted from the studio
by men in white coats.
In the feminist late 20th century, women are also allowed to play hardened
professionals. Jamie Lee Curtis in Kathryn Bigelow's thriller Blue Steel is
a cop who never lets a visible emotion pass across her face, even when
reading the Miranda act to her own handcuffed wife-beater of a father. And
in Dying Young (CBS/Fox) Julia Roberts is permitted several scenes of
no-nonsense nurse-like behaviour before turning on the faucets in this
girl-meets-Aids-patient weepie.
At its worst, the new interest in women's social and emotional identity can
produce embarrassing agitprop from male directors trying to swim with the
tide. Woody Allen's Alice (RCA/Columbia) is the fey, confected tale of a
yuppie's wife (Mia Farrow) who 'finds herself.' This means she falls in love
with a block of Italian-American machismo (Joe Mantegna) and drifts around
New York pretending she has become a writer, a woman and a whole person. You
would never believe from this film that Allen had cracked a joke in his
life. But a few artistic aberrations are a small price to pay for the
cinematic enfranchisement - it is slowly happening - of an entire sex.

FT  04 APR 92 / Gardening: Fresh fish in a deep freeze
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HARDING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MINUS 12' is not a temperature recommended for trying to impale bright red
mosquito larvae on a tiny hook. It leaves you with what can only be
described as mosquito juice over your aching, gloveless hands, and with
nothing but icy lake water in which to wash them clean. Reaching down
through a tangle of line, weights, float and hooks, you rinse your fingers
in the 6in-wide hole which is your window to the lake below. Then, after
wiping your hands dry on your Shuba, the enormous sheepskin coat which is
the sine qua non of all serious ice-fishermen, you lower the red bait down
until it sits, invitingly, just above the lake floor. There are two things
which make this masochism worthwhile. First, you will definitely catch a
fish. In fact, you will probably catch more than you can be bothered with. A
nursery school of overly-curious lesh (bream) played enthusiastically under
our ring of ice-holes. In three days, only restraint stopped me from pulling
out more than 50. Second, you get to toast every new arrival with Russia's
answer to a Fisherman's Friend - vodka. The lake I visited with a group of
Russian friends is six hours by car north-west of Moscow. Russian roads
being what they are, three punctures and only two spare tyres meant we took
twice that long.
Lake Seligier is a bright white maze of islands and inlets, its shores
cluttered with giant bullrushes and rickety pedalos, clamped for the winter
in 2ft of ice. A tangle of frozen tram lines marks the paths of
cross-country skiers. Wooden dachas and the occasional onion-domed church
hide among the pine trees.
The hotel in which we stayed - or, to give it its proper title, the House of
Leisure - sits on the lake edge. It is a contradictory, kitsch sort of
place: Butlins holiday camps meet Bolshevism. Clean, sparse rooms. Communal,
temperamental showers.
Each evening, we sat in a corner of the vast dining room eating oukha, the
steaming fish soup we had made out of the day's catch, while hordes of
adults in identical 1960s'-style track suits and groups of chaperoned
children swarmed punctually in and out for their set meals.
After dinner, the Butlins' influence gains the upper hand. Distracted
briefly by a recreation room full of broken arcade games, we headed
downstairs along a bright purple corridor, past maps which calmly proposed
210 km skiing tours, to the disco. The DJ did not take requests but was more
than happy to keep playing the latest hit, a Euro-pop track called Bad
Russians.
Clearly, though, Russians take their fishing more seriously than their
dancing. By the time we emerged on to the blinding white ice just after 8am,
small clusters of Shuba-coated fisherman were already dotted across the
lake, hunched over their holes.
Loaded up for the day, (Shuba, Fisherman's Friends, giant corkscrew to make
your hole, sieve to keep it ice-free, pocket-sized rod and line, stool,
vacuum flask, bait) we pushed off on our skis.
Somewhere out there, we were assured, were enormous pike. Perhaps next time.
For now, the art of hauling a 27kg fish through a 6in hole must remain a
mystery.

FT  04 APR 92 / Gardening: After all, what are good fronds for?
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ARTHUR HELLYER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PUBLICATION of two comprehensive books on ferns is of importance, as the
popular literature on this great group of plants is not extensive and much
of it is intended for the specialist.
In The Cultivation of Ferns (Batsford Press, Pounds 25) Andrew Machugh does
address himself to gardeners in general, his book is nicely illustrated with
good colour photographs and line drawings. There are good ideas about
growing ferns where space is limited, by making raised beds with soils to
suit particular types, and advice and lists of desirable varieties.
The second book was published last year, and is called Ferns in Your Garden
(Souvenir Press, Pounds 18.99). Illustrations, in colour and
black-and-white, are excellent and, although author John Kelly does not
claim to be a fern specialist, he is a general writer and broadcaster on
horticultural subjects. He has clearly mastered his subject and, like
Machugh, deals with it exhaustively.
But a whole book on ferns, is clearly for people who are going to cultivate
them seriously, probably regarding them as a speciality and aiming to build
a collection. That would be easy: according to Machugh, there are 67 fern
species native to northern Europe with a further 250 species in temperate
north America.
Many ferns - and this seems to be particularly true of native British
species - produce all manner of variations in the character of their fronds.
In Victorian times there was great interest in collecting and exhibiting
these minor varieties and giving them long, pseudo-botanical names.
All this can be great fun for those who enjoy such things, but at the
present time I see no prospect of a return to this kind of obsession.
What could be achieved with the right kind of information - and more ready
availability of hardy ferns in garden centres - would be a much greater use
of ferns in mixed garden settings; sometimes in mixed borders, along with
other herbaceous plants; sometimes in woodland or, if that sounds altogether
too grand, growing beneath a few trees; a natural habitat for many ferns.
Some are also natural rock plants, and there are those, like wall rue,
Asplenium ruta-muraria, and the rusty back fern, Ceterach officinarum, which
thrive in the crevices of limestone walls, seemingly extracting a living
from virtually nothing but stone and a little accumulated debris.
By contrast, there are the luxuriant moisture-lovers, such as the Royal Fern
(Osmunda regalis), which grows in fens and has great fronds up to 10 ft
high.
In Britain it used to be more common than it is today, and no one would want
to start another mad hunt for Royal Ferns to dig them up and bring them into
the garden. But there is no need for this.
Wild ferns are easy to raise from spores, which are produced very freely,
and also by other means. If there were a steady demand for a few dozen
kinds, it would be possible for nurseries to produce them quite cheaply with
no deprivation of the environment.
The Royal Fern is by no means the only fern that is ideal for planting
beside a pool or stream or in a damp hollow. Another, which I am especially
fond of, is the ostrich feather fern, or matteucia, a wonderfully green fern
with long, rather narrow fronds, that grow almost straight up, like a narrow
shuttlecock. This fern looks wonderful in a damp spot, either in the open,
or in semi-shade.
Ferns are by no means always ferny. The hartstongue, in its common form, has
undivided, shining green fronds, and will lodge itself between rocks or
around the boles of trees.
I have one that I found growing wild in my garden, and moved to a cleft
between the roots of a cut-leaved elder, where it has made itself at home.
It shares the ground with hardy, ivy-leaved cyclamen, which are colonising
this part of the garden. The two plants both enjoy such moderately shady
places. But, although typical hartstongue has undivided fronds, there are
forms which are pruned or crested, the fronds splitting at the top into
smaller sections. These forms are no more beautiful than the general type.
Indeed, it could be said that they are freaks, but they add interest to a
collection.
By contrast some ferns have fronds which are almost unbelievably complex.
The polystichums tend to be of this character, and the hard-shield ferns
(polystichum aculeatum) and the soft-shield fern (P. Setiferum) are of this
type.
I grow the latter in the same mixed border as the hartstongue fern, but in a
place where there is much greater depth of soil, and it does very well.
There is a fascinating form of it, named Proliferum, which forms little baby
ferns all along some of the fronds. If you take the trouble to hold these
fronds flat to the soil with stones or pieces of bent wire, the little
plants will root and start to grow vigorously. After a while, the while
frond can be severed and the separate plants, with roots, can be cut out
singly, giving quite a crop.
Many ferns grow in hedgerows, usually most abundantly on the shady side, and
this gives a clue to the conditions in which ferns like to live. The male
fern, Dryopteris felix-mas, is one of the commonest of these, and it appears
frequently as an intruder in my garden.
It makes large, well-divided fronds, not among the prime beauties, but very
acceptable in the rougher parts of the garden, where its dead fronds in
winter are not a nuisance. I would like to see more garden-owners taking up
ferns in this rather relaxed way.

FT  04 APR 92 / Gardening: Plant of the week - Pieris Wakehurst
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ARTHUR HELLYER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
This is one of the most beautiful of the Chinese lily-of- the-valley shrubs,
so called because of the resemblance of their white flowers to the
herbaceous lily-of-the-valley. This fine evergreen shrub is usually listed
as a variety of Pieris formosa forestii but there is some difference of
opinion about this and Pieris Wakehurst is sufficient to identify it
accurately. The flowers are not quite so regularly produced as those of some
other forms of this species but the brilliant red young leaves in spring are
outstanding in beauty. With age they fade to pink, then nearly white and
finally yellowish green before becoming their permanent rich green colour.
The bush can reach 15ft high in time but will take many years to do so and
can be kept to half that height by light pruning in late May or early June.
It needs lime-free soil.

FT  04 APR 92 / Gardening: Head for the hills - in Spain - Why is a flower
somehow better when found unexpectedly in the wild?  Robin Lane Fox muses on
the matter while studying Iberia's spring glory
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBIN LANE FOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHENEVER I go abroad to look for wild flowers, they go into hiding. In the
past fortnight conditions ought to have been perfect. Spring has already
broken in the Mediterranean; the Andalusian hills of southern Spain are a
botanical wilderness; the British calendar is two months behind the sunlit
temperatures of Malaga. When Britain starts campaigning, head for the hills.
From bus windows of the past, I remember Spanish fields of yellow bee
orchids, purple iris and grape hyacinths, rosemary, pale pink convolvulus
and Iberian narcissi. This year, they must have heard I was coming. There
has hardly been any rain all season; the ground is already like a brick and
if you think the English spring has been dry, spare a thought for mountain
homes in the western Mediterranean.
Dried out by the weather, the better flowers have hidden their faces. For a
week, I have tried hard enough to find them, on foot, two bike tyres and
even on four capricious hooves. I have seen cistus by the square mile and
enough lavender stoechas to make me slightly less cross that mine has died
in the winter. Thistles have dogged my progress and globe artichokes have
run wild under the olive trees.
As the temperature falls, I have bicycled through the afternoon scent
released by yellow coronilla; I have ridden for a day through oak-groves and
the thought of maquis which was the home of that childhood favourite,
Ferdinand the bull.
There were no bees, but one bee-orchid, a few small muscari, two lone plants
of the deep blue Aphyllanthes and hectares of a shocking pink erodium with
seed heads shaped like a cranesbill. The haul, in short, was below the very
low annual average on a Lane Fox World Botanical Index. When it comes to
Iberian wildflowers, others have more luck, probably in the north and among
the Pyrenees. When it comes to cultivated surprises, I still think that I
have had the best of it.
In the towns, on the hillsides, you do not have to look far. Spanish
gardeners know how best to grow plants on a balcony or mass them outdoors in
flowerpots. Their geraniums trail like streamers more than a yard long;
wrongly, we think of our varieties in Britain as plants which grow upwards,
not downwards. In April, we cannot expect roses, yellow jasmine and
wisteria. In Spain, they are already everywhere, as are the first bedding
plants.
We might perhaps find less ugly lighting for the grounds of our historic
castles, but would we have had the idea of massing nothing but scented white
stocks in formal beds below a fortress like Cordoba's Alcazar? Having missed
the best in wild nature, I have seen it twice in two Spanish towns.
Not until late May will the milder parts of England be enjoying Banksian
roses. They flower freely on pergolas in Somerset or up the front of sunny
houses in London, showing small roses whose double flowers are the colour of
lightly scrambled egg. Ten years ago, the king of all Banksians could be
seen running wild in Cordoba beside one of the regional bus-parks: I could
not relocate it, but in the town's old Jewish quarter there are plants of it
whose owners have exercised more care.
Their Banksian roses run right across the narrow streets on a friendly wire
from one white-washed house to another, cascading above pedestrians, the
only traffic. In Granada's great Generalife garden, you can see a
magnificent plant of the rarer and frailer white Banksian form. Southern
Spanish gardeners have given this wonderful climber its head, since its
arrival from China in the 1820s. In Britain, town gardeners could still make
more of it.
The first wisterias have already opened and a cascade of Banksians make
northerners think that they must be dreaming. Andalusian cooking will soon
bring you back to earth, but can anyone equal its antidote, an extraordinary
sight in the small civic gardens in the centre of the town of Ronda? Beneath
the purple flowers of old Judas trees, some genius once planted pale-pink
Moutan paeonies. These double-flowered varieties have finely-cut leaves and
huge heads of flowers which we tend to expect only in special borders, in
shade.
Many years old, Ronda's public paeonies are shaded only slightly from
ferocious sun. They are growing in no particular compost; the soil is
earthed up round them, as if they are young potatoes; I doubt if they are
watered throughout the heat of the year. Yet they are flowering
stupendously, just as old catalogues always claimed that they would.
In England, I have never proved the catalogues right. Before retiring, one
great nurseryman once hinted to me that he doubted if any of his customers
never had much luck with most of the Moutan plants which he supplied.
Perhaps we are all too kind to them, as if they need cool soil, manure and
the company of lilies and hostas. In Ronda they now grow as they seem to
have been grown in the Chinese gardens where plant-hunters used to remark on
them. It may have been Spanish cunning, but I suspect that like
bullfighting, it was a matter of hit and miss. In Britain, perhaps, we
should try the noble forms of paeony suffruticosa in full sunlight and dry
soil: nowadays, Amands of 145 Clamp Hill, Stanmore, Middlesex are the main
importers.
It is all non-infectious food for thought. Some of us seem to be botanists,
quick to see rare orchids in long grass before the cows have grazed them
flat. Others, I suspect, are gardeners with an eye for plants in
cultivation, growing in the most unlikely settings.
Why is a flower somehow better when found unexpectedly in the wild? The
finest sight in south Spain last week was a mass of paeonies in an urban
space. If you want to see narcissi, is it really any worse to enjoy the best
ones all over Hyde Park than to track them, not always successfully, to a
habitat in northern Spain?
Those who have the botanical knack do not always notice gardeners' oddities:
as in nature, so among flower enthusiasts, different species come in
different forms.

FT  04 APR 92 / Fishing: SOS - save our salmon
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM FORT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
I CAUGHT my first salmon on a breathlessly hot August day a quarter of a
century ago. Expert opinion held that conditions on the Cumberland Eden were
hopeless: the water low and scummy, the few fish stale and sullen. But
somehow I had to be kept quiet, so the keeper thrust a spinning rod at me
and bid me do my worst. When he saw my six pounder, he raised a hairy
eyebrow, muttered something about 'beginner's luck,' and shook me warmly by
the hand.
I can recall the capture of my last salmon pretty clearly, too - a gleaming
fish of seven pounds taken on fly in the shadow of Ashford Castle hotel in
the west of Ireland, with a admiring gallery of guests watching the fun. And
I can see each of the salmon which came between those two triumphs - all
eight of them. Ten salmon in 25 years is not an impressive tally.
But I am not a salmon fisherman. In fact, speaking purely as a catcher of
fish, I could do without salmon. For the trouble with salmon fishing is that
it is such a business. You have to arrange it months in advance. You must
travel vast distances. Once there, there is little else to do but fish, and
since you have paid thousands for it, do it you must. I haven't the money,
the connections, or the hunger.
But I still love the salmon, and the thought that this wonderful creature -
with its extraordinary, epic life cycle - might one day be lost to our
rivers is odious. It may be a cliche, but we would all - salmon fishermen,
trout fishermen, non-fishermen, members of the League Against Cruel Sports -
be diminished by such a loss. Is it possible?
There is no doubt that things are bad. Reports from the Scottish rivers show
that last season was calamitous. The story was broadly the same west, north
and east. Stocks of fish were pitifully small, catches unprecedently low. It
is not surprising that lamentations north of the border should have reached
such a pitch of rage and despair. Great effort and expense have been
expended there - particularly in buying off the estuary netting stations.
Yet the decline accelerates.
The great question is whether we should blame nature, or ourselves. There is
a theory - which I am too ignorant to assess - that the numbers of salmon
have waxed and waned on a cyclical basis through the ages. It is said to be
something to do with climate, enforcing mass migration of the food on which
salmon grow fat at sea. If we are patient, the balance will tilt again,
possibly within our lifetime - possibly not.
The advantage of blaming ourselves is that it offers the hope - maybe
illusory - that something can be done. Look at what we do to the salmon. We
destroy its spawning grounds with acid rain and poison the estuaries through
which it must swim. We net it in those estuaries, and at sea. We steal its
food, for use as fertiliser or heating oil. We pollute the seas, and
everything that in them lives. Oh - anglers catch a few.
Reluctant governments can be forced to act. Take the case of the infamous
north-east England drift net fishery. For years the fishing interests in
Scotland - where this atrocious practice was banned decades ago - have
gnashed their teeth at the interception of tens of thousands of salmon bound
for east coast rivers such as the Tweed and the Spey. The Agriculture
Minister, John Gummer, hummed and hawed, until the pressure became too much.
Last autumn - belatedly and grudgingly - he announced that the fishery would
be phased out.
So it can be done. Let us, therefore, holler at the Irish until they enforce
the ban on netting salmon off Donegal. Let us shame the Danes into ending
the plundering of sand eels in the North Sea. Let us pray that the EC
produces measures to protect fish stocks while there are still stocks to
protect.
Will any of this happen? One sighs, despondently, for the omens are not
encouraging. Governments prefer words to deeds. Action is only taken when
conclusive evidence is furnished - and usually not then. The problem when
dealing with something as complex as the survival of a species is that the
only conclusive evidence tends to take the form of extinction.

FT  04 APR 92 / Property: Portugal's golf estates drive away recession
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By AUDREY POWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ALTHOUGH the 550-acre Praia d'el Rey estate, on the coast north of Lisbon,
is almost entirely a new development, permission for building there actually
was given before Portugal's bloodless revolution in the 1970s. The site is
near the old walled village of 0bidos and its lagoon, and the fishing port
of Peniche.
Initially, a few houses were built by a Belgian company which used to own
the land. Then, the project was shelved. But it has been revived by its new
owner, Beltico, a consortium which includes Portuguese and British partners.
Plans envisage housing, three hotels, a village, and an 18-hole golf course
and clubhouse.
About 30 villas - many substantial - have been, or are being, built. Roofs
are pink-tiled, usually on several levels, and walls are cream or white.
Nearly all have swimming pools, some have tennis courts, and most will have
views of the sea, golf course or nearby woodland.
A few are only 50 yards from the beach, part of Portugal's 'silver coast'
where Atlantic waves roll onto the soft sand and send up fountains of spray.
Other buyers, preferring larger plots, have chosen sites farther back
looking into the woods. Indeed, some have bought two or three.
Initial purchasers have come from Singapore, Hong Kong, Malaysia and
Britain. but a number are Portuguese. This pleases the developers because
such owners are likely to make frequent use of the properties. They may even
commute to Lisbon, 80 minutes' drive away (although this will be cut to
under an hour when new roads are completed). Thus, the estate should have
occupants throughout the year.
When completed, there will be about 150 villas, 800 town houses and 600
apartments, mostly in the cobbled village which will form a corner of the
site. The price for a two-bedroom apartment could be Pounds 50,000, with two
or three bedroom town houses from Pounds 80,000. A four-bedroom detached
villa, with pool, could cost about Pounds 200,000, depending on site and
plot size.
Golfers will enjoy what is almost a links course, part of which will run
parallel with the sea with the rest spreading back over sand dunes and
moorland into pine woods. Work on the course - designed by an American,
Cabell Robinson - is just starting and should take 18 months. There is a
chance there could be a second course later. For further information in
Lisbon, call Beltico (tel. 315 76 07). In London, ring solicitor Swycher &amp;
Co. (071-224-3388); its senior partner is a director of the consortium.
Praia d'el Rey is just one of several golf schemes in the Iberian peninsula,
despite the recession. London &amp; Edinburgh Trust's LET Leisure has acquired
the controlling interest in Pinheiros Altos, a 250-acre golf course
development adjoining the Quinta do Lago estate in the Algarve of southern
Portugal.
The first batch of 9l villa plots is being offered there at prices between
Pounds 85,000-Pounds 240,000. Buyers can then choose from a selection of
house designs or use their own architect. Total cost could average Pounds
350,000-Pounds 400,000.
The course - designed by another American, Ronald Fream - will have a
computerised booking system and rounds will be limited to four hours. The
first nine holes should be ready by June, with the rest playable in the
autumn. Plot buyers will have guaranteed membership of the club and priority
access to its golf academy. Details from LET Leisure at 071-602-9922.
Another development on the Algarve for golfers is Vila Sol at Morgadinhos,
near Vilamoura, 20 minutes from Faro airport. This estate is similar to
Praia d'el Rey in that earlier work was halted by the revolution. In this
case, though, the new owner has built the 18-hole course first. Designed by
an Englishman, Donald Steel, and completed last year, it occupies a third of
the 367 acres and the Portuguese Open was played on it last month. Vila Sol
is thought to be the first course in Portugal built to United States Golf
Association standards.
The next stage is the housing. The 240 plots, of a quarter or half an acre,
encircle the course and the first are now being offered at between Pounds
67,000-Pounds 279,000. Villas will have views of the fairways or distant
mountains. The estimated cost of building a suitable three-bedroom design,
with pool, on such a plot is about Pounds 150,000. Buyers may choose from
various available plans or appoint their own architect, but he must conform
to development guidelines.
There are to be apartments and a five-star hotel on the northern boundary. A
business centre, clinic and leisure area for activities like tennis and
riding will come later. The development is a little away from the coast and
this, it is claimed, will make it more secluded. But it also has a private
beach club, with restaurant and bar, at Ancao beach and a regular shuttle
service will link the two.
Vila Sol is backed by the Grupo Atlantica, a Portuguese financial
institution which, among other interests, is a shareholder in the Banco
Totta &amp; Acores. The UK agent is Hamptons (071-493-8222).
The recent DRT International survey of European golf facilities shows that
Portugal has 20 courses, with 14 more being built and 90 projects under
consideration. Sandy Steven, of the Glasgow-based Tourism Resources Company
 -which studies the potential market for such facilities on behalf of
tourist organisations and developers - says that, despite the recession, the
luxury end of the market in Spain and Portugal is holding up, with demand
continuing for good-quality, low-density villas around courses.

FT  04 APR 92 / Property: A Landmark in holiday homes - Michael Stourton
reports on a unique property rental scheme
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL STOURTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
YOU MIGHT have reservations about paying to stay in a building that you knew
had been selected by its owner because it was 'too desperate, troublesome or
unfashionable to appeal to anyone else.'
Yet, these are the words used by Sir John Smith, founder of the Landmark
Trust, in explaining his criteria for 'the rescue of buildings in stress';
properties at risk that are to bear the Landmark Trust label.
Some of the names may conjure up a none-too-compelling image. Take Appleton
Water Tower, for instance, or the Bathhouse at Walton. Beamsley Hospital
does not sound particularly inviting; the Pigsty at Robin Hood's Bay still
less so. The House of Correction at Folkingham takes the biscuit for being a
turn-off.
Nevertheless, competition to take these buildings for a week's holiday, or
longer, is fierce. Despite there being no advertising, an occupancy rate of
80 per cent is achieved; a level most hoteliers only dream about.
The only part of the UK so far without Landmark is Northern Ireland.
Overseas, it has one property in Rome and has recently acquired Rudyard
Kipling's house in Vermont, US, the house Kipling built in 1892-3 shortly
after his marriage to Vermont-born Carrie Balestier. It was here that
Kipling achieved some of his most notable literary successes.
But holiday letting was far from being the main aim of John Smith, banker
and former MP, when he started the Landmark Trust in 1965. With a discerning
eye for unusual buildings in danger of being lost for ever, Smith set about
buying them up.
It was rarely a straightforward business. Difficulties of every kind were
encountered, including that of establishing legal ownership. There are now
nearly 200 Landmark properties.
The rate of conversion works out at about six new properties each year.
Landmark has its own architectural adviser and also employs local
architects.
Much trouble is taken over the furnishing and equipping of these places  -
an essential part of Landmark's attitude towards guests. Landmark believes
that by staying in these historic buildings people will gain far more of the
feel of a place than by merely looking at it.
Almost all the furniture is old, but good. Sometimes it, too, has been
rescued and repaired. Most of the curtains are specially designed and
printed by Landmark for each building, and carpets and rugs are chosen for
their quality and character.
Furnishing the buildings, in itself a formidable undertaking, involves a
team of people, including Lady Smith, whose influence in this direction
remains strong. The absence of televisions and their aerials speaks volumes
for the Landmark ethos.
There are sometimes informal links with the National Trust, where, for
example, land that goes with a building is administered by the National
Trust while the building is handled by Landmark. Unlike the NT, there is no
membership of Landmark. The decision-making process has, until recently,
been the province of Sir John and Lady Smith alone, although when Sir John
retired in June 1990 a committee of management was appointed.
Sir John regrets that he is seldom able to meet the people who stay in
Landmark properties. From entries in the logbook, with which every property
is supplied, he gains an insight into the enterprise and imagination that
visitors, including more and more from abroad, reveal in discovering things
to see and do. A surprising number are not on holiday at all, but have come
to do or study something in particular.
A price list and booking form are obtainable from The Landmark Trust
Shottesbrooke Maidenhead, Berkshire, SL6 3SW: Tel: 0628-825925. The
copiously illustrated Landmark handbook is Pounds 6.50, including postage.

   AN ENGLISH estate agent is offering a novel choice
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
plots on either side of the frontier between Spain and Portugal.
The land borders the Minho river, which separates northern Portugal and
Galicia. To go on the plots, the agent also is offering a range of
Norwegian-style chalets built of Madeira pine with broad ornamental
balconies.
The agent is Babet, based in Merriott, Somerset (tel. 0460-76213). It claims
that this type of building is particularly suitable for holiday homes
because there is almost no humidity inside. When a property is left empty
for a while, it does not become damp.
On the Portuguese side, the price of a one-bedroom chalet on an average plot
would, depending on foundations and site, be about Pounds 38,000, rising to
Pounds 57,000 for three bedrooms. The cost could be a little more on the
Spanish side.
The chalets are best suited to a rural setting, and Babet suggests that
anyone with guilt feelings about introducing a new building to such an
environment could grow grass and wild flowers on the roof, as they do in
Norway, after which the property would become near-invisible.

FT  04 APR 92 / Travel: Welcome to the pleasure dome - Richard Gilbert
enjoys a return visit to a Center Parcs all-weather complex
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GILBERT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN 1967, Piet Derksen, the Dutch founder and chairman of Center Parcs, had a
vision of the ideal holiday experience. It would be, he said, 'a holiday the
weather couldn't spoil, with every imaginable facility built in, combining
the flavour of the country club, the health farm, the sports complex and the
villa holiday.' To which the only answer might well have been: 'Come off it,
Piet - have another pils and stop dreaming.'
Today, though, there are 12 Center Parcs in Europe - seven in their native
Holland, two in Belgium, one in France and two in England.
The occupancy rate rarely seems to drop below 95 per cent; the company, now
part of Scottish &amp; Newcastle Breweries, increased its net profit last year,
and the concept envisaged by Derksen seems custom-built for sun-starved,
environmentally-aware North Europeans who want to take short breaks in
man-made forest villages.
Impressed by my first exposure in 1990 to the Center Parc formula at the
Elveden Forest village in Suffolk, I became part of the repeat trade and
took my unprotesting family last year to Holland, to see how the Dutch run
their own invention on home ground.
Thanks to the efficiency of Netherlands Railways we reached Het Meerdal, in
the south-east region of Limburg, just three hours after buying rail-rover
tickets in Amsterdam's Central Station.
Het Meerdal is one of Center Parcs' oldest villages, but the concept is the
same as the two English Center Parcs in Elveden and Sherwood Forest: 650
stone-built villas are cunningly scattered through 400 acres of woodland,
surrounded by gorse and sand. The cunning comes in the original layout and
its harmonisation with existing woodland. As a result, you are largely
unaware that there are 2,000 other holidaymakers in the village.
All the villas are single-storey with their own front path and a back patio
overlooking water or forest. Center Parcs' roads are a car-free zone and
most people hire bikes from a cycle centre.
After admiring the ten-station TV (including two free film channels) and the
view of the lake and woods through the sliding lounge windows, we headed for
the nerve-centre of every Center Parc - the Subtropical Swimming Paradise.
Here, under an impressive transparent cupola, is a fan-shaped leisure
lagoon: pools, chutes, rapids and flumes. The temperature is a constant 84
degrees and my two sons instantly disappeared like two pieces of pale
driftwood into a foaming slide that curved serpent-like outside the geodesic
dome and back again. At 102 metres, the Het Meerdal slide is the longest of
all the Center Parcs, and this was one of the features that helped tilt
their verdict over Elveden.
It is outside the Swimming Paradise that an English visitor soon notices the
differences between Center Parcs at home and away. At Elveden, the demand
for sports facilities, whether tennis, squash, bowling or petanque, is
greater than the demand at Het Meerdal. In fact, within months of opening,
Elveden had to expand its sports areas greatly just to keep up with the
British appetite for sports and recreation, despite the extra charge you
have to pay for all activities except swimming.
While Elveden hires out 3,000 bikes each week, at Het Meerdal only 1,000 are
rented. At Het Meerdal we had no trouble booking any sport we wanted during
our long weekend. Outside the swimming areas there are shops, restaurants
and cafes clustered round landscaped ponds, streams and rockeries under the
same transparent geodesic dome. Parakeets, turtles and flamingos laze among
the orchids.
I found a tranquil escape from all this sport at Chez Pierre, a bar that
offered an excellent selection of beers. For eating out you can choose
between an Italian restaurant, a pancake house, fast food or the Bistro,
which serves gargantuan meals. In Holland, though, more visitors seem to
cater for themselves than at Elveden Forest.
Centre Parcs states that the first staff to move on to any new site are not
designers or architects but professional ecologists who ensure that site
development does not destroy the local flora and fauna, which are all
carefully identified before a sod of earth is lifted.
At Elveden there are apparently more species flourishing in the ancient
Suffolk forest habitat than in 1987, when building began. I am no
naturalist, but the only red squirrels I have met in 25 years were a pair
that ran in front of my bike in Het Meerdal last summer.
The appeal of the Center Parc formula is that it crosses age barriers and
national frontiers, and leaves decision-making to the guests. If you want to
fish for golden carp or try your hand at archery, pony trekking,
wind-surfing, tennis or ten-pin bowling, the squeaky-clean facilities are
readily available. On the other hand, if you want to cook a meal in your own
forest villa (not chalets, thank you) or sink a bottle of genevra, that too
is easily done.
Above all, Center Parcs are unpressurised, comfortable and offer what the
trade calls an NWDF - a non-weather dependent facility. That is why the
villages are in such demand in autumn and winter.
How will Center Parcs develop? There are plans for a third English village -
in the grounds of Longleat - but the most interesting new direction is
likely to be leisure-starved east Germany and beyond. Think of all those
forests in eastern Europe and Russia. As a misty-eyed Dutch manager said to
me: 'Terrific consumer potential out there, but getting the infrastructure
sorted out will be a nightmare.'
Currently, prices for a two-bedroom villa at Elveden Forest range from
Pounds 222-Pounds 275 for a mid-week break (Monday to Friday), Pounds
235-Pounds 290 for a weekend, and Pounds 365-Pounds 456 for a week. During
the summer school holiday you can only book by the week: Pounds 637-Pounds
764 for a two-bedroom villa. In Britain, reservations for any Center Parc:

FT  04 APR 92 / Travel: Unruffled in Barbados
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID PILLING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE governor-general of Barbados ate my duckling. The theft, if I may so
damningly describe the incident, took place on my flight to Barbados when
the stewardess announced that duck was fully subscribed. The
governor-general sat in the row ahead of me, idly peering through the
window, quite unaware - or so she would have me believe - of her crime.
I mention the episode because it was the most traumatic event of my five-day
trip to Sandy Lane Hotel, Barbados. Guests of Sandy Lane, more of a
Caribbean institution than a hotel, are not used to being ruffled or
disappointed. But then, if I were paying Pounds 350 a night for a standard
room, I would not want to be ruffled or disappointed either.
Sandy Lane Hotel and Golf Club was the brainchild of Arthur Ronald Lambert
Field Tree, an Anglo-American and one-time Tory MP who put his roots down in
Barbados after visiting it on holiday.
Tree's hotel was not to be run-of-the-mill. In the words of its architect, a
certain John 'Happy' Robertson Ward: 'When I was designing Sandy Lane Hotel,
I put myself in the position of a well educated English Gentleman of the
late 18th century going to the West Indies to build a Great House.'
He constructed a classically elegant building of white coral stone, a
material which not only shimmers spectacularly at night, but which also
breathes, helping to keep the interiors cool in the scorching heat.
The hotel's central rotunda curves around two stately mahogany trees. Above
is a terrace with ravishing views of the Caribbean and the gently curving
bay.
Each of the 121 bedrooms has beds large enough, as I discovered, to sleep in
sideways and its own verandah. The marble-floored bedrooms, upgraded as part
of a recent Pounds 7m refurbishment, struck me as a little characterless,
like upmarket fitted kitchens.
Nonetheless, the English gentlemen for whom Sandy Lane was designed - those
that remain - continue to be lured. The rest of the hotel's guest list is
made up largely of Americans.
Sandy Laners are not the most adventurous holidaymakers. One couple,
visitors of many years' standing, admitted they had never ventured outside
the hotel save for the brief drive to and from the airport. The hotel
manager once held a cocktail party for repeat guests by the swimming pool at
one end of the extensive gardens. He was astonished to hear one confess
that, in all his years at the hotel, he had never realised there was a pool.
Sandy Lane boasts three staff for each room. Consequently, guests
temporarily forget the sensation of opening doors unaided, pouring drinks,
or hauling their towel down to the beach. Perhaps the sort of people who
stay here do not ever perform such menial tasks.
Once on the beach, reputed to be one of the best on the island's west coast,
guests are discouraged from yelling for service or coarsely clicking their
fingers. At Sandy Lane waiters are beckoned by placing a large flag upright
in the sand.
If such sybaritic living wears thin, one can always turn to sporting
exertions. The hotel has floodlit tennis courts and offers complimentary
waterskiing, windsurfing, snorkeling and hobie cat sailing.
The chief sporting attraction, however, is the 18-hole championship golf
course. Green fees (normally Dollars 75) are waived for Sandy Lane
residents, though hire of clubs and golf carts is extra.
In a discussion about Sandy Lane's high room rates, which incidentally do
not include service charge or local tax, a friend quoted the manager of an
equally exclusive hotel. Asked how he justified the room rates, he had
replied: 'Sir, we don't justify them. People pay them.' Sandy Lane is the
same.
David Pilling stayed c/o Sandy Lane Hotel &amp; Golf Club and travelled c/o BWIA
International. Half-board at Sandy Lane in the high season costs Dollars 700
(Pounds 380) a night for a double room with an ocean view. Reservations can
be made through Leading Hotels of the World, 15 New Bridge St, Blackfriars,
London EC4V 6AU (0800-181-123), or via Forte, which owns and manages it: UK
reservations: 0345-404040. Elegant Resorts (Lion House, 23 Watergate Row,
Chester CH1 2LE, 0244-329671) offers seven nights half-board including
return flights at Pounds 2,200 a person.
In London, BWIA International is at 48 Leicester Square, London WC2 7LT,
reservations: 071-839-9333. It flies non-stop to Barbados twice a week from
Heathrow. Return apex fares (low season) are Pounds 634, with first-class
returns at Pounds 3,226.

DAMASK SELLS finest white cotton voile nighties, delicately hand-embroidered
or hand-smocked. It sells old-fashioned tablecloths, white cotton
embroidered ones with matching napkins or patchwork cloths in
Provencal-style prints or soft chintzy prints.
There are plain, white, hand-embroidered sheet sets and a host of
white-on-white embroidered pillowcases to choose from. Then there are all
those old-fashioned accessories that one seldom buys for oneself but make
lovely presents - padded hangers, nightdress and handkerchief cases,
shoebags, all delicately made and beautifully embroidered.
The pure cotton bedlinen is possibly of greatest interest - a refreshing
change from the boldly coloured and violently patterned bedlinen that has
been in vogue for so long. Hand-embroidered sheet sets are Pounds 99 for a
single, Pounds 122 for a double. Duvet covers vary from Pounds 64 to Pounds
115 for a single size, depending on the amount of embroidery. Pairs of
pillowcases can be bought for Pounds 30, continental square pillowcases for
Pounds 35.
For those who like their bedlinen simple, there are two charming bedspreads
 -Arlette, which is in woven cotton with a medallion centre design (Pounds
92 for a single size) while Amaryllis, in white and cream, starts at Pounds
105 for a single.
The embroidered cushion covers, mostly in boudoir mode, are also charming
and range between Pounds 26 and Pounds 30 while nightdress cases are Pounds
23.50.
There are many different nightdress and nightshirt designs - some with
sleeves, some without, some in very fine cotton, some in heavier, some with
matching negligees, some without. All either hand embroidered or with fine
pintuck detail which gives them a delicate old-fashioned air.
Although almost all the Damask range is stocked by shops all over the
country (from The General Trading Company in London and Bath to Chintz and
China in Thornhill, Dumfries) Damask also runs an efficient mail order
service.
For a brochure write to Damask Furnishings &amp; Finery, Unit 10, Sulivan
Enterprise Centre, Sulivan Road, London SW6 3DJ (tel: 071-731-3470)
enclosing Pounds 2.50. The Pounds 2.50 is refunded on purchases over Pounds
25.

FT  04 APR 92 / How To Spend It: Old clothes, new money - Alice Rawsthorn on
the craze for collecting antique haute couture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A LITTLE black dress goes on sale in Paris this week. It is not exactly new
and the fabric is torn in a few places. The owner is open to offers  -
anything from Pounds 5,000 upwards.
The dress is a velvet evening gown designed by Balenciaga in 1950. It is one
of the star lots in La Mode Dans l'Art, a sale of antique haute couture
being held on Wednesday afternoon by Millon &amp; Robert, the Paris auctioneers,
in the Drouot auction rooms at the back of the Paris Opera.
Until recently antique couture was only of interest to the obsessive - the
fashion fiends who would rummage around jumble sales, charity shops and
costume auctions in the hope of spotting a late 1930s Schiaparelli ball gown
or an early 1950s Christian Dior day dress.
The market is now much more competitive. There are more dealers and more
collectors. The costume shops of London, New York and Paris are crammed with
Japanese tourists searching for early Chanels and Yves St Laurents. The best
pieces are snapped up by auction houses - Millon &amp; Robert in Paris, or
Christie's in London - to be sold for thousands.
At a time when prices elsewhere in the art market are plummeting, the cost
of antique couture is rising. Perhaps the best indication of the market's
strength is that the most expensive piece in this week's Millon &amp; Robert
sale is one of a pair of Louis XV fancy dress costumes designed by
Balenciaga for Barbara Hutton, the Woolworth heiress, and her partner for
the 1951 Bestegui ball in Venice. One of the costumes was auctioned by
Christie's in London last summer for Pounds 3,080. Less than a year later it
is back on sale at Millon &amp; Robert, this time with a minimum reserve price
of FFr60,000, or about Pounds 6,000.
Only a very special piece of couture would be worth as much as Pounds 6,000.
Balenciaga is one of the few couturiers whose work commands so high a price.
Francoise Augen, who organised the Millon &amp; Robert auction, reckons the
others are pre-war Chanel, Paul Poiret in the early 1910s, Christian Dior's
New Look in the late 1940s and early 1950s, and anything by Charles James or
Jacques Fath. Susan Mayor, director of costume at Christie's in London,
would add Vionnet and Schiaparelli before the war.
'The value of a piece of couture depends on so many different things,' says
Mayor. 'The condition, of course, but a piece will be worth much more if it
was worn by a famous client or a favourite mannequin, if it appeared in
fashion magazines at the time and, most important, whether it was a key
piece in the designers' development.'
An auction house such as Christie's is only really interested in pre-1960s
couture. Although there is a market for more recent pieces, particularly for
1960s Paco Rabanne and early St Laurent. Christie's only buys haute couture,
never pret-a-porter, and only if it is in mint condition.
Anyone wanting to sell tattier couture, their mother's old Chanel
pret-a-porter, or anything made since the 1960s would be better advised to
go to a dealer. Didier Luot, one of the best-known Paris dealers, buys old
couture, Chanel suits and Hermes bags for his shops in the Palais Royal. He
pays half the price of sale - Pounds 300 for a Chanel suit he would sell for
Pounds 600, or Pounds 1,500 for a crocodile Kelly bag to be sold for Pounds
3,000 - and sends everything to be cleaned, repaired or renovated.
It is only in the last four or five years that the antique couture market
has really taken off. The original collectors came, unsurprisingly, from the
fashion world. Among the designers, Azzedine Alai has a wonderful collection
of Vionnets and Issey Miyake has been buying for years. Anna Piaggi, the
Italian fashion editor, is another long standing collector as was Tina Chow,
the model who died earlier this year and whose collection is now on show at
the Fashion Institute of Technology in New York.
There are now more collectors around. Museums, such as the Metropolitan in
New York and the Victoria &amp; Albert in London, are allocating more space to
couture in their collections and tend to take the cream of the auction lots.
These days life is much more difficult for the early enthusiasts. Hamish
Bowles, style director of Harpers &amp; Queen magazine, has been an avid
collector since buying his first piece of antique couture - a late 1950s
Balenciaga suit - 15 years ago at a charity bazaar. He still scours charity
shops in London and races around the thrift stores whenever he is in New
York, but most of his recent purchases have come from auctions, after
tip-offs from dealers or from 'friends of friends who know someone who wants
to sell something.'
'I still sometimes find the odd bargain in charity shops,' he says. 'But
it's becoming far harder to find anything really good. There are so many
more people buying these days and they really know what they're looking
for.'
There are some consolations. The couturiers themselves are more aware of the
value of their work. Christian Lacroix saves at least one example of
everything he makes. And the thrift store bargains of the 1970s and early
1980s are much more valuable. The Balenciaga that Hamish Bowles bought for
Pounds 3 all those years ago is now worth Pounds 300 or Pounds 400.

FT  04 APR 92 / Cookery: Good cod on Good Friday
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIPPA DAVENPORT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SALT COD is the food of Mediterranean countries. I have always presumed they
rejoiced in such dishes as brandade de morue, le grand aioli, baccalao al
pil-pil and salt cold fritters because the fresh cod of cold northern waters
was not available to them. And we, I presumed, ate only fresh cod, not salt.
Not so. Salt cod, I learnt recently, used to be important food in Britain,
too. Right up to the middle of the 19th century it was regular fare in many
households. The rich ate fresh fish too, when they could get it, but on
certain days salt cod was eaten by all levels of society.
Indeed, until the death of Queen Mary, grandmother of our present Queen,
salt cod was de rigueur at Marlborough House on Ash Wednesday and Good
Friday. Then the salt fish was served, simply soaked, poached and flaked,
with egg sauce, floury potatoes and boiled parsnips.
The combination of salt cod and parsnips is an ancient one, presumably
because of the way the sweetness of the roots offsets the salt of the fish,
and in Lent parsnips are usually at their best. A popular variation on the
Marlborough House presentation was to serve poached salt cod in the piece,
garnished with chopped or sliced hardboiled eggs. In this case, parsnips
appeared as a sauce.
In some parts of Scotland a preference emerged for mixing cooked and flaked
salt cod with parsley, shallot and creamy mashed potato. The mixture was
spread in a pie dish, dotted with butter and baked until browned. This
rather sloppy sort of fish pie was served with egg sauce and - you have
guessed it - boiled parsnips.
The Portuguese still make something similar, but they incorporate garlic and
raw eggs into the fish and potato mixture, and they serve the finished dish
with black olives and a green salad - a better contrast of colour, flavour
and texture than parsnips.
The Portuguese are passionate about salt cod. They call it 'the faithful
friend' and claim to have as many recipes for it as there are days of the
year. The best of this vast repertoire, in my opinion, the only salt cod
recipe I really relish, is miniature salt cod fishcakes.
PORTUGUESE SALT COD FISHCAKES
First soak 8 oz salt cod in cold water for 24 to 36 hours depending on
thickness, changing the water several times. Drain and rinse. Simmer the
fish until tender (about 20 minutes) in milk and water to cover. Drain and
cook 10-12 oz potatoes in the liquid.
Saute a small finely chopped onion (and some garlic if liked) in a little
olive oil. Mash the potatoes. Skin, bone and shred the fish. Mix both
ingredients with the onion, a couple of tablespoons of chopped coriander or
parsley, and 2 lightly beaten eggs. Season to taste.
Use floured hands to roll the cold mixture into  1/2 inch diameter balls,
and cook until golden in a frying pan containing an inch of hot oil. These
are delicious served hot or cold, as a snack with pre-dinner drinks, or for
dinner with rice and a salad and maybe a garlicky mayonnaise.
In Britain, while the poor had no choice but to eat salt cod on fish days,
those who could afford to often chose fresh fish instead. So far as cod was
concerned, the head was considered the choicest delicacy.
Mrs Rundell described it, in A New System of Domestic Cookery in 1806, as 'a
very genteel and handsome dish', prized for its mixture of firm flaky flesh
and rich jelly.
'Some,' she says, 'are fond of the palate (of the cod) and others of the
tongue, which likewise may be got by putting a spoon into the mouth'.
British squeamishness about fish seems to be a modern development. As
recently as 1956, Dorothy Hartley recorded in Food in England that cod's
head was still served in deep-sea fishing ports: 'Fishermen say it is the
best part of the fish'.
Cod's head is a large cut, comprising two-thirds or more of the fish, the
shoulder as well as the head (a thick shoulder signals good cod). It should
be gently poached in court-bouillon (so the books instruct us) and, like a
boar's head, it should be brought to the table elaborately garnished and
garlanded with parsley, lemon and maybe grated horseradish.
Serve it (the instructions continue) with a fine oyster or shrimp sauce, and
plain boiled potatoes or brown bread and butter. No parsnips. No eggs.
I confess I have not tried it myself, my excuse being that cod's head was
not to be found in these parts last week. I turned my attentions instead to
cooking more readily obtainable thick slices or steaks of fresh cod, hake
and ling, all members of the same family.
First of all , I cooked hake as described by Elizabeth Ayrton in her book
The Cookery of England, following an early recipe she had adapted for LING
AS YELLOW AS A GOLD NOBLE. To make this, the pieces of fish are rubbed with
cut onion, seasoned and thickly coated with oatmeal, fried briefly in
butter, and packed into a shallow fireproof dish. Chopped onions and diced
parsnips, fried in butter until soft and golden, are packed into the gaps
and over the fish.
Court-bouillon, turned clear gold by the addition of saffron, is poured
over, then the dish is covered and slipped into a moderate oven to complete
cooking. It is unusual, as she says, and I commend her advice to replace the
parsnip, if you dislike this vegetable, with carrot. A generous handful of
chopped parsley and a few black olives added at the end are, I think, an
improvement.
My own suggestion for this Good Friday is simpler still.
HAKE (OR COD) WITH TARATOR is a dish which features neither parsnips nor
eggs. I partner it instead with lightly boiled or steamed green beans and a
floury variety of potato sprinkled with plenty of chopped green coriander.
Make the tarator sauce first, a day or two ahead if you like. Whizz 4 oz of
flaked almonds in a food processor to reduce them to a coarse powder. Add 1
oz bread which has been soaked in cold water and squeezed dry, and 4 to 6
garlic cloves sprinkled with salt and crushed with the back of a knife. Pour
on 4 fl oz olive oil mixed with the same amount of water, processing as you
pour, to blend the ingredients to a thin creamy porridge. Season with salt,
pepper and lemon juice and chill until needed.
For the fish, take 6 hake or cod steaks about 1 in thick, choosing whichever
is fresher. Put the fish steaks in a baking dish with sea salt and pepper, 1
tablespoon of olive oil and half as much lemon juice. Turn the fish to film
all over with the flavourings and leave for an hour or so, turning the fish
over occasionally.
To cook, cover the dish and bake at 400'F (200'C) gas mark 6 for 12 minutes,
or until the fish can be pulled easily from the bone. Beat the cooking
juices into the chilled tarator sauce and garnish the fish with chopped
fresh coriander and wedges of lemon.
If you prefer, the fish can be cooked on top of the stove rather than baked:
put it in a pan, pour on hot court-bouillon to cover and poach very gently
for about 8 minutes. Cod will cook a little quicker than hake.

FT  04 APR 92 / Food: Bargain buys when you are in France - Off on holiday?
Jancis Robinson picks some wine bargains
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANCIS ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONE OF life's great mysteries is why anyone ever buys a bottle of wine in a
so-called duty-free shop - especially in France, where excise duty on wine
is negligible anyway. You can usually save a pound or two on a bottle of
champagne, but the overpriced still wines are to be avoided at all costs,
especially at airports.
The two most arresting sights at Charles de Gaulle Airport recently were
'Euro Disneyfication' in full swing, and the Chateau Haut-Brion 1984 offered
there for sale at FFr380 a bottle, when it could be bought in a French
supermarket for FFr199.
As this year's holiday season gets under way, British wine enthusiasts would
do well to keep a keen eye on wine prices in France, particularly because,
from the beginning of next year, returning Britons (like all EC travellers)
will be allowed to import as many as 120 bottles of wine without any
question of having to pay the UK chancellor's distasteful new excise duty of
95p a bottle. (You can bring in even more if you can convince Customs
officers that it is really all for personal use.)
Britain's more aggressive retailers are said to be scouring the Channel
ports for likely sites; personally, I fear for the nation's axles. A saving
of Pounds 114-plus-VAT a head is quite an incentive to cram bottles into
every possible corner of even the frailest of vehicles. I only hope that the
ferry operators will take into account the dramatically increased weight of
returning Brits - not just a few extra pounds on the waistline, but about
180 kilos (nearly 400lb) of vin per person.
But what sort of vin should it be? A trawl around French supermarkets
reveals just how seriously they now take wine - fine wine, in particular. It
would seem that any self-respecting Auchan, Carrefour, Euromarche, Leclerc
and Monoprix has to have its treasured bottles of Chateau d'Yquem and,
perhaps, an 'off-vintage' of a first-growth claret, to reassure customers
that it, too, knows what the famous names of Bordeaux are. And prices for
off-vintages are revealingly low.
At Angers Euromarche recently, for example, you could buy a bottle of either
Ch Latour 1987 or Ch Haut-Brion 1984 for less than FFr200 (Pounds 20), below
the theoretical current wholesale price at source in Bordeaux, long before
any taxes or margins are accounted for. (For these wines, Harveys of Bristol
and London's Berry Bros &amp; Rudd charge Pounds 32.22 and Pounds 40
respectively.) This, of course, is evidence of the dire straits in which the
Bordeaux merchants now find themselves, having been forced to buy lesser
vintages to secure their allocations of the good ones. (Many British
supermarkets are similarly awash with 1987's less successful bottlings).
A better bet, for those who like their bargains to taste good too, would be
the current special offer in Auchan supermarkets in the Paris region
(centralised buying is rare among French retailers) on 1985 and 1989
clarets. No off-vintages, these. Ch l'Angelus 1985 is just FFr160 francs
(Pounds 25 at Peatlings) while Ch Nenin 1989 is Ffr95 (Pounds 14.99 in
Oddbins' 1989 offer).
You might not want - or be able to devote - all of your 120-bottle allowance
to such smart wines, but it is significant that French supermarkets can
offer a range of crus classes, and the odd truly great wine, by the single
bottle - even if many have reached the shelf via America and even Britain
(check for slip labels, and that there is no seepage).
Montparnasse's INNO/Monoprix clearly sees itself as a wine showcase, with
three vintages apiece of Chx Mouton and Margaux, including Ch
Mouton-Rothschild 1970 at sive jewel Ch Latour 1961 languishing on a dark
shelf at FFr3200. (If you could find it in Britain, you would almost
certainly have to spend more than Pounds 4500 to buy a whole case of it.)
Foires aux Vins, special wine promotions, have become an established fact of
hypermarche life. Many branches of Leclerc will be in full fling this month.
The Bayeux one, about an hour's drive from both Cherbourg and Le Havre, has
a much better cave than the supermarket norm throughout the year.
But the most realistic wine value in France is under FFr40 a bottle (wines
that would sell in Britain for Pounds 2-Pounds 7). The current rash of
special offers on petits chateaux, Bordeaux's legion of small wine farms,
can take supermarket prices as low as FFr12 a bottle for a fault-free claret
which would cost at least Pounds 3 on a British shelf. It would also make
sense to stock up on names more familiar to the French than the British -
such as sturdy red Madiran, which could sell for FFr18 a bottle; Bourgueil
(FFr26), or Sylvaner d'Alsace (white wine prices are not so hot this year,
thanks to frosts a year ago).
Good specialist wine merchants, cavistes, are much thinner on the ground
than in Britain. The Guide Hachette des Vins, a 950-page annual wine
directory available in most French bookshops, lists fewer than 25 outside
Paris. The Caves Jeanne-d'Arc, in Rouen's rue Jeanne d'Arc, is the most
accessible to cross-Channel raiders.
For the true connoisseur, however, France's greatest duty-free treasures
will be found chez the family that made them. The trick is to identify the
quality-conscious goodies - rather than the avaricious baddies - which lurk
behind the signs promising you Degustation-Vente. An investment of FFr159 in
the Guide Hachette could repay handsomely in this respect: it lists most
(not all) of France's top producers and the wines they have to sell,
together with a price guide, star ratings, telephone numbers, opening hours,
vinification details and even tasting notes for those (French speakers) who
wish to impress as they taste their way through dark caves and dusty
cellars: the very antithesis of airport shopping.

FT  04 APR 92 / Food: Bargain buys when you are in France - Nicholas Lander
recommends some hotels and restaurants
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS LANDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FRENCH might not be the first to admit it, but the British have been
pioneers in discovering the country's hidden charms.
During the 19th century, when the French considered the Riviera far too hot,
intrepid British travellers settled there to get away from the miserable
British winter. The Promenade des Anglais in Nice was constructed at the
instigation of the Reverend Lewis Way, an Anglican vicar, in 1822.
Today, in northern France, the situation is the reverse. The French head
south in search of the sun, leaving the charms of northern France to the
Dutch, Belgians and British. The biggest marketing problem indigenous
hoteliers and restaurateurs face is that the consumers in their main
domestic market - Paris - consider northern France too cold, too evocative
of Emile Zola's coal mines, for their holidays.
Instead, since the 1920s, the British have been moving in steadily, bringing
their most favoured pastimes with them. Golf or horse racing at Deauville,
golf and a casino at Le Touquet where you can stay in the Westminster or the
Bristol; and wonderful gardens at Varengeville-sur-Mer.
Although the scenery is different, the weather has the effect of making the
British feel even more at home. The last time I was in Le Touquet, with a
film crew it, was raining so hard we thought we would have to abandon the
afternoon's filming. Half an hour later we were on the beach in weather that
could easily have passed for a summer's day.
As soon as the rain threatened, we did what has become the latest British
pastime in northern France, and dived into a restaurant for lunch. This part
of France now offers the quickest fix for anyone in search of the pleasures
of French cooking.
The fruits of the fishing industry still provide a living for a large part
of the local population (Boulogne is the fishing capital of Europe) and some
very sophisticated cooking, most notably at Montreuil, Cancale and further
inland at Caen and Rouen.
The increasing foreign presence can be seen in the restaurants' car parks,
where foreign number plates easily outnumber French ones. For anyone living
in the south of England, it is cheaper and easier to visit northern France
for the weekend than to discover the increasing number of gastronomic
highspots in Scotland and Wales. Furthermore, French restaurateurs have
always made eating out with children less difficult, first by accepting them
gracefully, then by offering a children's menu without fuss.
Since the recession has hit demand from the UK, French hoteliers have been
offering some attractive packages - at Chateau de Montreuil a winter package
of Pounds 55 per person for room and half board has maintained occupancy and
kept the restaurant busy. As the summer season begins, these deals will
disappear until autumn.
If, as the Chunnel will increasingly dictate, you arrive at Calais, the best
advice for the hedonists is to head straight out.
Go north to Teteghem, six kilometres from Dunkirk, to La Meunerie (tel
28.26.14.30); 40 kilometres south to the Moulin de Mombreux at Lumbres
(21.39.62.44); or along the coast to the more numerous restaurants which
surround Boulogne.
You can eat well at the Relais de la Brocante at Wimille (21.83.19.31); eat
and drink well at La Matelote near the port (21.30.17.97) - the proprietor
makes a point of matching different wines by the glass to each course; and
at the Hostellerie de la Riviere at Pont de Briques (21.32.22.81).
Further along the coast, in the Le Touquet area, there is the plush comfort
and excellent cooking of the Chateau de Montreuil (21.81.53.04), and the
very particular charm of Les Pecheurs des Etaples (21.94.06.90), where a
simple restaurant sits above a fish market alongside a quay.
For the distinctive cuisine du terroir (for example, freshwater pike and
perch), try the Bon Acceuil (21.06.04.21) at Attin, or Le Coq en Pate at
Argoules (22.29.92.09).
To the north of Dieppe the Abbaye de Valloires (22.29.97.55) offers
accommodation in a 17th century setting, and Chez Mado on the Somme estuary
serves cockles, mussels and its famous sole du Crotoy (22.27.02.22). In
Dieppe the specialities of La Melie (35.84.21.19) include a dish that
incorporates thin slices of kipper and smoked salmon. Along the coast there
is the Auberge du Dun (35.83.05.84) at Bourg-Dun, and at Veules-les-Roses,
close to one of the centres of French gardening at Varengeville sur Mer, you
can visit Les Galets (35.97.61.33).
The size and wealth of the population along the Seine estuary has created a
large number of good hotels and restaurants. These include the hotel Ferme
at St-Simeon (31.89.23.61), and the restaurant L'Assiette Gourmande
(31.89.24.88) in Honfleur. Deauville has Le Spinnaker restaurant
(31.88.24.40). In Bayeux there is the Lion d'Or (31.92.06.90), both to stay
in and eat at, and the Argouges (31.92.88.86), for those who would like to
enjoy a night in a former 18th century private house. Rouen and Caen boast
their own culinary heavyweights. In Rouen go to Gill (35.71.16.14),
L'Ecaille (35.70.95.52) or Le Beffroy (35.71.55.27), and in Caen, La
Bourride (31.93.50.76) and Daniel Tuboeuf (31.43.64.48).
The culinary star along the north French coast, for those who have strength
and stomach for the nine-hour ferry journey from Portsmouth to St Malo, lies
14 kilometres east of St Malo, opposite the magnificent Mont St Michel, at
Cancale: the Maison de Bricourt, run by Olivier and Jane Roellinger
(99.89.64.76). Specialities include Cancale oysters, lamb reared on local
salt marshes and, like any thoughtful French hotelier, a children's menu at
Ffr120.

FT  04 APR 92 / Cookery: Mixing it in the backwaters of Thailand - Kieran
Cooke recalls dazed nights sipping an electrifying rice whisky with the kick
of a mule
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KIERAN COOKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
YOUR starter for 10: What is Mekong? Ah, you say, no problem. 'Mighty river
flowing through Indo-China, for centuries one of the great arteries of the
world, dividing baking-hot rice fields, plains and mighty jungle covered
uplands . . .'
But hold on. Listen again. It was not Mekong. It was Mae Khohng. Something
different altogether, though from the same part of the world. If you have
the answer then you win a pair of dark glasses and a lifetime supply of
liver salts.
Mae Khohng is a form of whisky made of rice and various electrifying
ingredients, including molasses, a special mould and yeast. It is unique to
Thailand - though once I stumbled on a bottle on the back shelf of a dingy
wine shop in Paris. It is a drink to be approached carefully, like a
dangerous looking animal. But treat Mae Khohng the right way and it is
magical. I first came across Mae Khohng in the northern Thai town of Chiang
Mai in the early 1970s. Beer was too expensive an accompaniment for long
evening meals at the night market. Mae Khohng was the local tipple. One sip
and I was hooked.
For starters, it was cheap: 25 Thai Baht - about Pounds 1 at the time - a
bottle. The mix is the most vital part of the drink. Mae Khohng drunk
straight is lethal, equivalent to a hefty kick from a very angry mule.
Instead there is a ritualistic mixing process.
For this, you could have no better guide than Major Roy Hudson, a great
character in the 1960s and 1970s in Chiang Mai. He wrote a guide to Chiang
Mai, and dealt extensively with the mysteries of Mae Khohng. The mixture he
favoured was the Barkowsky, named after a renegade Polish artist who lived
and drank in the town.
'Pour one and a half fingers (a generous peg) into a crystal glass. Add ice
and (this is the master touch) a squeeze of lime. Top up with sparkling
soda. Float on a couple of slices of lime (optional).'
Major Hudson, Poona Club member and former commander of the Nawab of
Malerkotla's Engineers in Burma, described Mae Khohng as 'probably the best
drink east of Suez.' It was certainly seductive on those long evenings, as a
few of us would sit watching the world go by, breathing in a heady mixture
of night jasmine and exhaust fumes.
One of the difficulties was that the Mae Khohng and the soda would never
keep an even pace with each other. You would buy a quarter bottle of Mae
Khohng (for about 30p) and order a bottle of soda. After a while you would
need more soda (which cost about the same as the Mae Khohng). Then you would
discover that the Mae Khohng was finished but there was still most of a
bottle of soda left. More Mae Khohng would then be ordered. Soon, one could
develop what Americans would refer to as 'a problem'.
Meals would often be shared with Bob Cooper, an anthropologist who does
worthy work running a refugee camp in the far north of Thailand. We used to
bet the bill on the one who guessed the date of the Mae Khohng vintage. The
production date, according to the Buddhist calendar, would be visible on the
inside of the label. It was always very young, sometimes premature, with a
date still to come showing through the amber liquid.
Since the early 1970s Thailand has changed a great deal. The country's
economy has boomed. The tourists have flooded in. Bangkok now vies with
Mexico City for the title of world's most polluted capital. Chiang Mai has
been transformed from sleepy town to bustling metropolis. Thais have taken
to consuming more sophisticated, imported drinks. Mae Khohng is not so
widely available as it was.
I know Cooper is still going strong. I hope Major Hudson is, too. If so,
somewhere in northern Thailand there will be a table covered with Mae
Khohng, soda bottles and lime skins. And two figures, looking a little
dazed, discussing Burma, Buddha and the date on the inside of a bottle.

FT  04 APR 92 / Sport: Rising star falls back to earth - Squash / At 18 Del
Harris was set to rule the world. At 22 he's happy with a slice of Essex
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN HOPKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE OXFORD dictionary says that 'burn out' is to burn to nothing, to
extinction. The young squash professional sitting in the Ardleigh sports
centre near Colchester was far from that. Jeans and a lumberjack's shirt
could not disguise his build, that of a heavyweight boxer. True, he looked
as though he would rather have been match point down against an old rival
than talking about himself, but little about him suggested he was a man
burnt to nothing.
Yet some say Del Harris is burnt out. He is the boy wonder who did not go on
to become world champion, and it is doubtful now that he ever will. 'What do
you do when you wake up one morning aged 19 and realise that you've done
just about everything there is to do in squash?' asked an acquaintance of
Harris's.
Long before he could vote, Harris was the most brilliant junior squash
player Britain has ever produced. He won every title open to him in England.
He won the Drysdale Cup, the de facto world junior championships, four times
in a row, an unprecedented achievement.
One night in 1988 he gave an exhibition at the Royal Automobile Club in
London. 'Del will play your two best players', said his manager, Norman
Norrington, with a knowing smile. 'Put them both on court against him, one
against two. Del is a big, strong boy. He can handle that.'
It was a remarkable demonstration of Harris's talent. Taking enormous
strides and hitting the ball so hard that at times it sounded like thunder
claps, Harris hurtled around the court to such effect it looked as though it
would need three opponents to contain him, not two. Those who watched that
night were convinced he would become world champion in due course.
But Harris may have soared too high too quickly. The man who was ranked
eighth in the world when he was 18 is now 12th in the world aged 22. In the
British Open squash championship, which starts today, Harris has no
expectation of getting beyond the last 16.
'Del is an exceptional athlete', says Jonah Barrington, Britain's best-ever
squash player. 'He was very confident on court and he has immense power
which on occasions has to be seen to be believed. I remember watching him
play Ross Norman (a former world champion). Norman was obviously very
experienced. He was prepared to play an attritional game, which Del doesn't
like to do because of his height and weight. Del obliterated him in
half-an-hour for the loss of three points. It was one of the most remarkable
demonstrations I have ever seen. It should have been videoed for posterity.'
Performances such as this were rare. Harris is big and heavy - 6 ft 1 in and
nearly 14 stone, hardly the ideal measurements in a sport where champions
are several inches shorter and as much as four stone lighter.
His notorious on-court confidence suffered from a series of challenge
matches against the Pakistani stars, Jehangir and Jansher Khan, the best
players in the world. The Khans, sensing an emerging rival, were determined
to put the upstart in his place once and for all, and did so with
devastating effect. In ten matches Harris won only one game.
He climbed to No 7 in the world only to injure a disc in his lower back,
probably from training too hard. No sooner had he recovered than he suffered
an attack of Bell's palsy, an illness that affects the facial nerves. For
three weeks he was numb down the left side of his face. He could not feel
the water when he took a shower. Half his tongue was numb. Then, almost as
suddenly as it had arrived, it disappeared.
At last he was fit and healthy again. But these setbacks had scarred him
mentally. 'Going on the circuit early and playing the top guys all the time
meant I got beaten a lot and that knocked my confidence', says Harris. 'I
started doubting my ability, my fitness, my technique. In time all these
doubts got to me. They affected my mind. It has not gone as well as it
might.'
Squash expects potential champions to work hardest when there are the most
temptations not to. 'To be dedicated is not enough', says Barrington, whose
own dedication was unquestioned. 'You need to be obsessed with it.' Far from
being obsessed by squash, Harris has become rather tired of it. 'Because my
life has been given up to squash I've lost a little interest in the game',
he says. 'I started playing when I was nine and it has been squash every day
since then. I never seem to have a break. I need a rest.'
Harris is a gentle man, handsome and rich. He is about to move in to a
Pounds 250,000 house being built for him by his father, and he owns other
property near Colchester where he grew up. He may not have become world
champion, but he is healthy and happy, never more so than in his home
surroundings. Age is on his side. He may yet come again.

FT  04 APR 92 / Sport: The Light Blues' burden - Rowing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILLIP HALLIDAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE MAIN thing that stops Cambridge winning the varsity boat race is
Cambridge. That was the opinion of Mark Lees, last year's Light Blues'
coach, after he had watched them lose for the 15th time in 16 years.
Lees served three years at Cambridge and spent most of his time trying to
break the Oxford voodoo. He produced excellent crews that somehow fell short
on the day.
He argued that no matter how good the Cambridge crew was, it always strained
under the weight of that losing run - a weight that grew heavier during the
last two weeks' preparation at Putney when the opposing crews trained in
each other's pockets.
The last two weeks before the 4 1/4 -mile ordeal are when the mental
approach to racing becomes as important as the physical, when the camps try
to psyche each other. For example, during a spell of rough weather last week
the crews could not get on the water. Cambridge had already lost some rowing
time because of injury. 'You can't afford to lose another session,' shouted
one of the Oxford contingent in the direction of Cambridge. This was
good-natured stuff and greeted with laughter, but the barb was well-aimed.
Is Cambridge really the home of lost causes? They have recruited John
Wilson, who last year coached the Oxford camp. Wilson knows all the Dark
Blues' strengths and weaknesses; he may know Oxford's Achilles' heel as
well.
Oxford's strength lies in their sophisticated regime of coaching and
training. The foundations were laid by Dan Topolski, the coach who turned
Oxford around in the 1970s. The system was built up by Steve Royle, Oxford's
director of rowing, whose five-year contract expires after today's race.
Jurgen Grobler, the former East German national coach, joined as technical
consultant this year and said there was little he could add.
However, Oxford have appeared vulnerable this time. At the Reading head of
the river race on March 7, a timed processional race over 4 1/4 km, Oxford's
prospective Blue Boat was beaten into second place by Imperial College.
Isis, the reserve Oxford crew, finished just 9 seconds behind the first
eight, which left the coaches to ponder crew selection.
On February 25, Oxford's squad had been hit by the death in training of John
Hebbes, who was fighting for a place in the top boat.
As Oxford were losing, Cambridge were spanking Nottingham's international
lightweight squad over the first half of the boat race course. They showed
plenty of skill and have the beef to go the distance.
At Oxford, meantime, the selection knives flashed. Boris Mavra, Hamish Hume
and Ian Gardiner were promoted, the latter moving into the stroke seat where
he had performed well for Isis. His rise has been meteoric. He learned to
row at St Peter's College, Oxford, two years ago.
Cambridge argue that the late changes are a sign of panic in the Oxford
camp. Cambridge seem in good spirits, and there is little sign of the
drooped shoulders that Lees complained of. Observers and bookies have made
them favourites, but this is often the kiss of death.
The crews race from Putney to Mortlake today, starting at 2.35 pm.

FT  04 APR 92 / Motoring: Renault passes road Czech - Stuart Marshall enjoys
driving the new Safrane to Prague
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STUART MARSHALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AS THE Renault Safrane bumped over the tram tracks and splashed through the
puddled, patched tarmac, the rain turned into sleet. Pilsen last week looked
about as inviting as a Welsh mining town on a wet March day.
Superficially, nothing seemed to have changed much since last I drove in
Czechoslovakia 10 years ago. Then, although we had all the right paperwork,
it took more than an hour for the frontier guards to allow us in.
As we waited, we watched their dogs sniffing the undersides of lorries
hauling gravel over the border into Germany, while more guards probed the
loads with steel rods. They took care in those days that no Czech citizens
escaped.
When we flew out of Prague, there were locked security doors through which
to pass before reaching the airline check-in desk, and again at immigration.
The city was beautiful, but Czechoslovakia was not a happy country. Every
10th person seemed to be a uniformed official.
One difference now is that Prague taxis are new Volkswagen Passats, not
creaking old Volgas, and there has been an import boom in second-hand German
cars. Czech motorists no longer have to choose between an appalling Trabant,
Moskvich or Wartburg or, if luckier, a rear-engined Skoda or a Lada.
There are plenty of newish Renaults, Opels, Fiats and VW Golfs on the
lightly-trafficked roads,although aged and battered Skoda Octavias survive
in rural areas.
This time, though, I did not even have to stop at the border when leaving
the country. A guard, seeing my British passport held up, just smiled and
waved me through. That was when I realised things really were different.
The new Renault Safrane I drove from Prague to Zurich made its debut at the
Geneva show last month and will reach Britain by autumn. It is a replacement
for the Renault 25, which never made much of a mark in the UK. That was not
the case in France where, even in the last year of its life, it outsold the
much newer Peugeot 605 and Citroen XM combined.
The Safrane is Renault's bid for a larger slice of the market for
top-of-the-range, volume-produced cars. Rivals include the BMW 5-Series,
Rover 800, Saab 9000 and, of course, the 605 and XM from the PSA Group.
Last year, 1.8m of the nearly 13.5m cars sold in Europe were in the
Safrane's size and price class. The affluent Germans bought nearly 44 per
cent of them; France, Britain and Italy took around 11 per cent each. So,
while Renault's main target clearly is the German buyer, it hopes to sell
about 7,000 Safranes in the UK each year.
Initially, Britain will be offered only two-litre, four-cylinder and
three-litre, V6 models. Mainland Europeans will have a much wider choice,
including a petrol 2.2-litre and a pair of turbo-diesels.
The Safrane could be taken for a saloon with a separate boot but, like the
25, is actually a five-door. This seems odd when you recall how Ford was
bruised by adverse reaction to its hatchback-only policy for the present
Granada/Scorpio range. (It added a four-door a couple of years ago, and its
long-awaited estate car version arrives in a few days). But Renault, while
admitting that some Germans are not too keen on large hatchbacks, thinks the
Safrane's virtues will overcome this drawback.
In two days and more than 500 miles (800 kms) of driving on everything from
dry roads to packed snow, and in weather ranging from brilliant sunshine to
blizzard, you get to know a car quite well. Both the three-litre V6s - one a
five-speed manual, the other a four-speed automatic - impressed me as
vigorous, comfortable and, above all, very quiet and refined mechanically.
Their suspensions dealt nobly and almost silently with rough roads. At 130
mph (210 kmh) and over, they felt reassuringly stable and still ran quietly
on the Autobahn.
Next day, I switched to a Safrane with a 2.2-litre, 12-valve, four-cylinder
engine developing 140 horsepower compared with the V6's 170 bhp. It went
nearly as well as the V6 on the Autobahn but, with little more than half the
three-litre engine's torque (pulling power), lacked a certain urge on hills
and demanded more gear-shifting.
The Safrane is a roomy five-seater with a generous boot. At the bottom of
the range, ABS brakes will be an optional extra; but the poshest V6 will
come with everything from leather seats to a self-levelling suspension that
lowers the car automatically for high-speed driving.
UK prices have not been fixed, but it would be surprising if a two-litre
Safrane with automatic transmission were priced at around the present
tax-break figure of Pounds 19,250.

CHARLIE, Chris, Margot and I played the 18th at Pebble Beach recently.
Unhappily, we were not in California but in Birmingham, England. It was not
quite the same.
The real Pebble Beach 18th tee is high above the Pacific ocean, and the
fairway curves like a scimitar around the clifftops to a green a par-five
away.
We, by contrast, were standing on an artificial surface inside a booth 20 ft
by ten ft by 14 ft. We were aiming at a screen which showed a simulated
picture of the hole. It was not like the real thing.
Nothing can reproduce the feeling of being out in the fresh air on a sunny
day with a clear sky and a following wind.
That said, I must add that this device came nearer than I imagined was
possible.
Golf simulators have been around for more than a decade. They flash a series
of pictures of a hole on a screen at which you aim. But they bear no more
resemblance to playing on a golf course than a pitch and putt course does to
a full 18 holes.
This new machine is much more realistic, even if it is unable to make you
forget you are standing on an artificial surface in a booth. Where it
exceeds all its rivals is the feeling it gives you of actually playing the
hole in question.
If you slice, the ball goes right; if you hook, it goes left. If you hit
into the water, there is a splash. Hit into a bunker and you have to play
your next shot from a sand bunker in the booth. For putts there is a putting
surface and a hole. The machine tells you the precise distance your shot has
travelled, keeps score for all the players and provides full sound effects.
These US-made machines have found a ready market in Japan, while four have
been installed at the David Lloyd leisure centre in Finchley, London. They
range in cost from Pounds 35,000 to Pounds 40,000. So far the courses you
can play on it are famous US ones.
As for Britain, filming has been done of the Belfry and you will be able to
play simulated golf on this course quite soon. Other courses are in the
works.

FT  04 APR 92 / Sport: Taxman grabs Britain's Olympic gold - Sponsorship /
UK sports administrators have a tough adversary in the Treasury
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEITH WHEATLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THREE MONTHS from now the British team sets off for the Barcelona Olympic
games. Unexpected medals will be won, predicted triumphs denied. Uncertainty
is the seasoning of all sport. Yet even at this early stage it is possible
to identify one clear winner - the UK Treasury.
Of the the Pounds 7m raised by the British Olympic Association to pay for
participation at Barcelona, slightly more than 20 per cent will disappear in
corporation tax. 'I've made provision for a tax liability in excess of
Pounds 1.5m', says Robert Watson, a London barrister and treasurer of the
BOA.
In a 31-nation survey conducted by Watson and his colleagues, they could
find no other country that taxed funds raised to support Olympic teams.
Ironically, during the course of the BOA research, the government announced
its Pounds 55m support for Manchester's bid to stage the 2000 Olympics. The
government giveth, and the government taketh away.
'If the BOA didn't do this fund-raising every four years, who would be
paying for our athletes to go to the Olympics', asked Watson rhetorically.
The government would, of course, via a Sports Council grant - as it used to,
prior to the partially boycotted Moscow games of 1980.
'We've relieved HMG of that responsibility and basically all we've received
for it is a smack in the face,' Watson continues. 'I'm delighted with what
they're doing for Manchester, but it does seem the final turn of the screw
that sportsmen are helping pay for it.'
Since the bitter scenes of 1980 over whether British athletes should compete
in Moscow, the Olympic movement in Britain has preferred quiet negotiation
with government over confrontation. For the past two years, Watson and his
colleagues have been seeking to persuade the Treasury to exempt BOA funds
from tax. A high-powered lobbying firm has been employed, to no avail.
Now the gloves are off, and the Olympic movement has decided to go public
with its grievance. 'Our income is from two sources,' explained Watson. 'The
most visible is the public appeal and for Barcelona that should raise around
Pounds 2m. We don't pay tax on that.
'But the largest part of our income, around Pounds 5m this time, comes from
commercial sponsorship.' Companies making substantial donations to the
appeal are entitled to use the British Olympic symbol in their marketing and
advertising campaigns, as well as calling themselves 'Official Sponsors of
the British Olympic Team.'
The Inland Revenue, alone among its international brethren, defines this as
'trading' - and taxes it accordingly. Watson knows from informal briefings
and conversations with ministers that the government regards exemption for
the Olympic movement as the thin end of a terrifyingly large wedge.
At present, revenue from sport - derived primarily from VAT, betting taxes,
income tax and corporation tax - is estimated to be worth Pounds 3bn per
year to the exchequer.
The officials worry that once the exemption door is opened a chink, everyone
from Manchester United to Wimbledon will claim the moral right not to pay,
citing the Olympians as their precedent.
'We're pushing on the grounds that the Olympics is unique and does not
invite comparisons,' counters Watson. 'The BOA has no ability to generate
income in the way domestic sporting events do.'
The association's expenditure splits into two strands. The first is simply
transporting a team and its equipment to the Olympics, then clothing,
housing and feeding them while they are there. For Seoul in 1988, this
involved transporting 561 people, 55 bicycles, 19 horses, 16 yachts, ten
rowing craft and 15 canoes halfway round the world.
Second, but also vital if British entries are to go beyond mere
participation, the BOA funds qualifying tournaments, acclimatisation
training camps and injury treatment. Colin Moynihan, former Conservative
sports minister, recognised that the nation expected some prospect of
success - Britain is not yet plucky Monaco, thrilled just to be there.
'Some help is necessary to enable prospective international competitors to
meet their rivals on equivalent terms. Success is sport reflects well on
both our standing in the world and on trade and on morale,' Moyniham told
parliament when he was sports minister.
In terms of expenditure on sport, the government has shallow pockets but big
expectations. In the year 1990-91 the amount spent per head of population
was 97p (the comparable figure for the arts in 1989-90 was Pounds 2.76). By
contrast, Italy spent Pounds 5 per head, while even Denmark's outlay topped
Pounds 3 per head.
Cynics maintain that the Pounds 55m promised to help Manchester's Olympic
bid has far more to do with vote-winning in politically marginal north-west
England than it has with support for sport.
'We painted John Major into an electoral corner,' confessed Bob Scott,
ebullient impresario of the Manchester bid. Local councillors make the point
that the city cannot lose, wherever the games go in 2000.
'The chancellor could make this exemption in minutes, it doesn't need an Act
of Parliament,' frets Watson. If it doesn't happen, he sees it as inevitable
that the BOA becomes an active trading organisation. 'We don't want to go
into it, but if we have to, we will.'

FT  04 APR 92 / The Titanic's tales of terror: Alexander Garrett on a famous
maritime disaster
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALEXANDER GARRETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN THE afternoon of the April 15 1912, Bruce Ismay, managing director of the
White Star Line, filled out a Marconi telegram form for company headquarters
in New York. 'Deeply regret to advise you Titanic sank this morning 15th
after collision iceberg resulting serious loss life,' he wrote. 'Further
particulars later.'
Ismay was aboard the rescue ship Carpathia, one of 705 survivors - 1,516
perished. But his message remained unsent until 5.50 am on the 17th, nearly
two days later. The wireless telegraph was Carpathia's only contact with the
world, and as its operator worked round the clock to send out messages from
survivors, the signal from the White Star managing director - confirming
what the world already feared - was overlooked.
Today, a vessel involved in a collision would be in contact with coastguard
authorities within seconds. Then, the delay caused enormous uncertainty,
provoked accusations of censorship, and added one more mystery to the
intrigue surrounding the disaster.
On Tuesday April 14, Ismay's communique is one of 448 radio signal messages
relating to the Titanic to be sold at Christie's in South Kensington,
London. Together they provide a poignant chronicle of events in the world's
most famous maritime disaster, 80 years ago this week. The collection is
being sold by John Booth, who has exhibited them at the Titanic Signals
Archive for the last three years.
That these signals survived is remarkable. At the time the Titanic went
down, telegraph companies kept originals of all transmitted signals for 12
months. Messages from ships involved in the Titanic disaster were assembled
for the two public inquiries, one in the US, the other in London. After
that, they were returned to the Marconi company where they were held in a
vault until the late 1940s.
When Cable and Wireless took over the Eastern Telegraph Company - as it had
by then become - the signals were earmarked for destruction, but they were
salvaged by an unnamed employee, whose son found them hidden in a suitcase
when his father died 30 years later. Booth later acquired the signals. He is
selling them now, he says, 'because my wife says they take up too much of my
time'.
Before the wireless was invented by Guglielmo Marconi in 1896, ships
communicated with each other by flags and light signals.
But when the Titanic set sail from Southampton on Wednesday April 10 1912,
she had the most powerful wireless yet fitted. She was one of the first
liners to have two wireless operators - John Phillips and Harold Bride, both
employed by Marconi - who could together provide a round-the-clock radio
watch.
Early in the voyage, they were busy telegraphing arrangements for passengers
to meet relatives in New York. It was a lucrative business for Marconi: each
message cost 30 shillings, at a time when the second wireless operator
earned 50 shillings a month.
It is the tone of optimism that is striking. One starts: 'Fine voyage fine
ship feeling fine'. Another: 'Hardly wait to get back. Cable made me awfully
happy. Love Mutzie'
One, however, was more ominous. 'Westbound steamers report bergs growlers
and field ice in 42 N from 49 to 51 West. April 12th Compts Barr'
On April 12, the Touraine radioed to report 'dense fog and thick icefields'.
Further danger signals followed from the Californian and the Caronia. One of
the great unresolved questions of the disaster is why the Titanic's captain
continued to sail towards the danger zone at 22 knots, especially as Harold
Bride, the Titanic's surviving wireless operator, told the US inquiry that
he had passed on the message from the Californian, and it had been
'personally acknowledged' by Captain Smith.
Later that day a fateful message was sent: 'Sinking wants immediate
assistance'.
The shortcomings of the wireless - as then operated - become evident
immediately following the collision with the iceberg. Unlike the Titanic,
most of the ships that night had only one radio man, if any.
Thomas Cottam, sole operator on the Carpathia, should have finished duty at
midnight. At 12.30 he was about to retire when the first distress signal
came through. The Carpathia sailed to the Titanic's aid at full speed, but
it was 60 miles away, three and a half hours sailing. Another ship, the
Californian, was (by its own controversial account) only 19 miles away, but
its wireless operator, Cyril Evans, had gone to bed. A third vessel, the
Norwegian trawler Samson, may have been even closer, but had no radio.
Marconi was later asked why his apparatus did not have a bell to wake the
operator. He replied: 'On the old equipment used by ships there was a bell
arrangement, which did not work well because it alarmed the operators of all
ships, as well as the one called.'
'Titanic struck iceberg sunk Monday 3 am. Carpathia picked up many
passengers am proceeding New York. Captain Rostron.'
The signals flying through the airwaves created total confusion for the
press. In New York, The Evening Sun trumpeted 'All saved from Titanic after
collision.' The following morning in London, the account in The Times was
riddled with contradiction. After reporting that the Titanic had sunk with
'great loss of life,' it cited later that she was being towed by The
Virginian to Halifax, or was heading under her own steam to New York.
By the following day, April 17, the full extent of the tragedy had become
clear and the recriminations began. The Times scolded the Central News
Agency over a phantom wireless message which had reported everybody safe;
while questions were asked about signals being 'interfered' with by 'amateur
operators'.
An explanation for one of the 'phantom' signals later materialised. A radio
ham unwittingly merged two signals, one asking 'Are all Titanic passengers
safe?' and another from the Asian announcing she was towing the German
tanker Deutschland to Halifax. The result: 'Titanic passengers safe being
towed to Halifax.'
Before the Titanic went down, its two radio operators were given permission
to leave their posts. Bride was washed overboard, but was picked up by the
Carpathia. As the Carpathia headed back to New York, he assisted Cottam in
sending messages from survivors. A few remained cheerful, as: 'Meet me dock
with two hundred dollars underwear cap big coat. Am well but feet slightly
frozen answer George.' Others were tragic: 'Mother girls safe father Charlie
missing'. 'Father not seen no hope arrive Carpathia Wednesday New York.
Richard.'
The US inquiry made a number of recommendations about the use of
radiotelegraphy on ships. But although the Titanic sinking had highlighted
its shortcomings, the momentous significance of radio communication for
sea-going vessels was elegiacally summed up in a Times editorial on April
16:
'But for wireless telegraphy, the disaster might have assumed proportions
which at present we cannot measure; and we should have known nothing of its
occurence for an indefinite period . . . The advantages conferred by this
abridgment of space are enormous. No vessel need be alone, none need vanish
without a sign from human ken; and in none but crushing and instant
disasters need any despair of help.'

FT  04 APR 92 / As they say in Europe: A poor standard of political insult
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES MORGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FRENCH must have had enough of their own politics and elections this
week, but this has not stopped them stepping up their coverage of events in
Britain. They are fanning out over the sceptred isle, choosing significant
destinations.
Never anglophile, Le Figaro went to Edinburgh, where its rival, Le Monde,
had been a little earlier. The latter has now put York on the front page,
partly because it is the UK's most marginal constituency, and partly because
Le Monde is one paper which can discuss York without its readers confusing
this with the matrimonial affairs of the Queen's second son.
For the business paper Les Echos, it was the gritty anonymity of the West
Midlands. For Liberation, the daily paper of the youthful caviare gauche, it
was inevitably Hampstead and Highgate and a large picture of the Labour
candidate, actress Glenda Jackson.
Marie Guichoux deployed her local knowledge in writing about 'Ham and High'
 -as she called it, dutifully - where 'one must convince the outlying poorer
districts while attracting the intelligentsia. Between the Freud Museum and
the tomb of Karl Marx, there is to be found the greatest concentration of
men of letters, psychoanalysts and great fortunes of London. Boy George,
ex-King Constantine of Greece, John le Carre and Peter O'Toole are near
neighbours.'
Les Echos chose North Warwickshire, the marginal seat of treasury minister
Francis Maude who was supported by the trade and industry secretary, Peter
Lilley. They had a tricky encounter at one of the few economic success
stories of recent years, the Betterware mail order firm, which employs 160
people. As the paper noted: 'Asked what they wanted from the next
government, the directors of this small firm chorused: 'Tax concessions for
investment.' Silence from the two ministers: such a measure appears in
Labour's programme but not the Conservatives'.'
In Edinburgh, Le Figaro's Jacques Duplouich enjoyed a similar frisson of
schadenfreude, talking to rebellious elements there, and blaming the former
prime minister, Margaret Thatcher, for any disaffection north of the border.
He concluded: 'Whatever happens, the status quo is no longer possible.
Whoever wins the election will have to undertake a revision of the Act of
Union. Or expose themselves to serious trouble.'
For Le Monde's Laurent Zecchini in York, it was the manner in which the
campaign was being fought that proved interesting. 'Hardly any great rallies
a la francaise, few walkabouts, but targeted and thematic meetings,
perfectly controlled and, above all, making the most of television
publicity.'
Zecchini followed Tory leader John Major through the hospital in York, a new
private trust under the recent reforms, and became one of the few
correspondents to broach the fearful affair of Jennifer's ear. 'Labour
employed every means of concentrating attention on the gaps in the national
health service, notably the incredible waiting lists . . .' So there came
about the film of Jennifer Bennett who had to wait 11 months for an ear
operation.
According to Zecchini, the huge controversy over some gaps in the film
enabled the Conservatives 'a little hastily, to seize the opportunity to
hurt (Labour leader) Neil Kinnock . . . they questioned his 'fitness to
govern,' a modest statement that, in the conventional register of British
political dialogue, constituted a grave attack against the leader of the
opposition.'
There, Zecchini was facing up to the huge differences in the political
language of France and Britain. The actual words used by the Tory chairman,
Chris Patten, to attack Kinnock were 'unfit to hold public office.' In
France, to say the opposite and declare someone 'fit to hold public office'
would imply grave character defects and attract a libel suit.
Furthermore, the nature of debate in France is such as to make the jaded
encounters of British politicians seem positively socratic. Across the
Channel, it is quite normal to characterise opponents in a manner that only
the most libertarian newspaper in Britain would dare translate. The result
is to render it impossible to convey in the British media the precise
qualities that make French elections so different.
By the same token, it must be quite hard for the French to make British
disputes appear significant when the worst insults sound like compliments.

FT  04 APR 92 / Running a risk is the point: Jonathan Young on the horsey
set
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JONATHAN YOUNG
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE IS little to match the English beauty of polished chestnuts, led by
equally polished brunettes, at Newmarket's July meeting.
Unfortunately this is Rembrandt beauty: we all appreciate it, but few can
possess it. Wealth beyond the dreams of Ferraris is needed to own even a
moderately fast thoroughbred.
Yet it is possible to enter the owners' enclosure for as little as Pounds
5,000 - if the enclosure exists. Such a sum will buy you a whole horse for
point-to-pointing rather than a share of a hoof in a dodgy flat-racing
syndicate.
There is, of course, a drawback. Pop four bottles of fizz when your horse
wins by a nod, and that will be the end of the winnings. Top prize, in
bookie parlance, is just four 'ponies': Pounds 100.
That does not deter point-to-pointers. Quite the opposite. The sport's
poverty restricts the appeal to those who appreciate the sport. The fashion
nuances of the cocktail-clad at Ascot's Ladies' Day do not trouble those
swaddled in puffas, paddling around in milking-parlour gumboots. It is cold
and very horsey: the two essential ingredients of English country life.
Throughout the spring, thousands of horse-owners, admirers, riders and
gamblers will be attending the 202 meetings at 117 courses countrywide. The
better horses travel the circuit with their owners, and these are carefully
marked down as likely candidates for Pounds 5 on the head. The race-card
gives form: 'error-prone'; 'moody'; 'moderate at best' are the customary,
unforgiving descriptions of the outsiders. (Their jockeys' faults, sadly,
are not documented.)
With such sketchy details, most betting is as scientific as laying money on
a fly's climb up a window. The one secure guideline, as disclosed by a
book-maker last Saturday, is: 'do your maffs'. With rare exceptions, bookies
know the form, such as it is, and their assessment of the odds is usually
spot on.
Most of the money, though, goes on competing friends and family rather than
on the horses. As the Irish have it, the jockeys are riding 'for the crack'.
(Often, literally.)
Most so-called dangerous sports, such as mountain-climbing, car-racing or
parachuting, have a degree of injury potential. It does not compare with the
risks run by the average point-to-point rider.
The danger is proportional to the fitness of horse and jockey. To qualify,
the rules demand that pointers spend six days' hunting - developing both
stamina and jumping experience. But although hunting demands the utmost in
courage and stamina, the sport is following hounds, and hounds seldom gallop
flat out over jumpable country.
The Tweseldown point-to-point course stretches just over three miles, with
19 steeplechase fences, each 4ft 3in, between start and finish. It is a hard
test of horse and rider. Few fail to complete the first circuit; the second
mile is the test, as exhaustion forces mistakes and inexperience pushes
riders on when they should pull up. Tragedies can occur.
All entries were going well at the fourth race at an Army point-to-point at
Tweseldown in February. They cleared the ninth fence, and were 15 yards
clear before the chestnut in the centre inexplicably stumbled, cartwheeled
and fell, legs twitching, on top of its rider.
Both lay still, the horse with a broken spine, the jockey concussed. The
rest of the field swung round, oblivious, cleared the eighth and galloped
down to clear the ninth, beyond which lay the prone bodies. An attempt by
the stewards to divert the field was unsuccessful, and in the melee a second
horse and rider lay still on the ground. This time it was the horse that had
the wind knocked out of it and the jockey who was damaged: Simon Cobden, an
undergraduate about to take his finals, had his cheekbone fractured and a
broken arm. Both riders were taken away by ambulance. So was another rider
in the following race. Simon Cobden's hospital ward was half-filled with
Tweseldown casualties.
It was a ghastly moment, and it underlined the risks. Nothing can compete
with the silky elegance of the Classic flat-races or the professional jump
jockeys assaulting the Grand National. But for old-fashioned guts and
esprit, there is nothing to beat a point-to-point.
INFORMATION: The next point-to-points at Tweseldown, Aldershot, are on April
18 (1.30pm). Local hunts hold point-to-points throughout the spring and
advertise in the local press. Entrance about Pounds 10 a car. Vacuum flasks,
sweaters and gumboots essential.

FT  04 APR 92 / The lost city that never was: Patti Waldmeir on the
entrepreneur who is making a myth in the African bush
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATTI WALDMEIR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN THE arid bush of Bophuthatswana the ruins of an ancient civilisation have
been discovered, a place of stately pleasure-domes and gardens bright with
sinuous rills . . . enough to please a modern-day Kubla Khan.
Well, that is the myth, anyway. But the visionary in question is not
Coleridge. It is Sol Kerzner, a South African entrepreneur who made a
fortune providing South Africans with inter-racial sex and gambling at Sun
City. Now Kerzner is spending R730m (Pounds 146.8m) to build an 'ancient
ruin' in the African bush, a supposed lakeside palace supposedly overtaken
by jungle. He has named it the Lost City. You have to visit Bophuthatswana,
itself a ludicrous creation of apartheid, to appreciate the delightful
preposterousness of the idea.
'Bop' (as it is known) is a nominally-independent black homeland made up of
bits of bush scattered across the northern Transvaal. It has no natural
lakes or jungles, let alone ancient ruins. There are almost no such ruins
anywhere in sub-Saharan Africa: nothing survives Africa's harsh climate. Bop
is a landscape of red rocks and stunted bushveld, baked dry by a brutal sun.
'We created a story in which a tribe migrated from the north and settled in
this hidden valley to escape from civilisation,' explains Gerald Allison,
the project's American architect. 'In our myth we gave these people a palace
surrounded by lakes and a lakeside city . . . Over time the jungle took over
the city. Only recently was it rediscovered, and now excavations are
revealing its true extent and beauty.'
With completion set for next December, architects and artists are working
hard to create the promised ruin. 'Everything has to look like it's been
there for 500 years and survived an earthquake,' says site guide Leslie
Moore, describing the process by which glass-reinforced concrete is made to
look like ancient Pilanesberg stone from the surrounding hills.
The 'palace' - a luxury hotel with 350 rooms - is being built on a scale
which no known African civilisation could have rivalled. Guests will enter
an enormous foyer, with a domed ceiling six storeys high. Towers and domes
will adorn the exterior. Every bedroom will be decorated individually. There
will be carved monkeys peering around table legs, heavy wooden armoires,
toiletries wrapped in tree bark. At a proposed R600 (Pounds 120.70) per
night for a double room, the price will compare well with other South
African luxury hotels, and it will seem cheap to foreigners.
Prices can be kept relatively low because of Sun City's casino, which will
also serve the adjacent Lost City. Some R180m is to be spent doubling the
casino's size; already its facade has been rebuilt, with giant elephants and
monkeys carved in what looks like natural rock (but isn't).
The success of the Lost City myth will depend, though, on the jungle, lakes
and waterways which will surround the palace.
Trees are being uprooted throughout southern Africa and transported to the
site. There will be a 26 hectare man-made forest - including anomalies such
as a tropical rain forest with 30,000 orchids dangling from its branches.
Indeed, there will be 22 different types of forest, with a large variety of
plants never before cultivated by man. Visitors will traverse the jungle
with the help of swinging bridges which would make Harrison Ford nauseous.
The palace gardens will sport a heated 'ancient' bath, a 600 square metre
relic of past splendour. Its surrounding stonework has tumbled into the bath
itself, and may be admired from viewing windows below water level.
There will be a sandy beach, complete with 2 metre-high waves (Bop is
thousands of miles from any seaboard), and water slides to terrify the
timid. The height of these slides is equivalent to that of a five-storey
building. Two run underground; their designer explains that this will make
them feel even quicker. Another slide is designed for crude terror: swimmers
will fall down an almost vertical drop for five seconds; time enough,
surely, to despatch the faint-hearted.
Kerzner, chairman of Sun International Bophuthatswana (Sunbop), the company
which is building the Lost City, says he believes the new development will
bring in 1.5m more visitors every year - double the number currently
visiting Sun City. To be sure, inter-racial sex and gambling are nothing to
build a future on: sex is no longer segregated by law, and gambling is
likely to be legalised throughout South Africa, not merely in the homelands.
But fantasy will always sell. The new South Africa, with its high crime rate
and political convulsions, needs fantasy now more than ever before.

I UNDERSTAND that capital losses on unquoted investments can be set against
income for tax purposes. Does this apply to overseas unquoted investment
losses?
No. One of the many conditions (set out in sections 574 to 576 of the Income
and Corporation Taxes Act 1988) is that the company has never been
non-resident:
576 Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988
(4) For the purposes of sections 573 to 575 and this section a qualifying
trading company is a company none of whose shares have at any time in the
relevant period been quoted on a recognised stock exchange and which:
(a) either
(i) is a trading company on the date of the disposal; or
(ii) has ceased to be a trading company at a time which is not more that
three years before that date and has not since that time been an excluded
company or an investment company; and
(b) either
(i) has been a trading company for a continuous period of six years ending
on that date or at that time; or
(ii) has been a trading company for a shorter continuous period ending on
that date or at that time and has not before the beginning of that period
been an excluded company or an investment company; and
(c) has been resident in the UK throughout the period from its incorporation
until that date.

FT  04 APR 92 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: All my worldly gifts
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
I DRAW my state pension plus an allowance for my wife, who is not yet 60,
and not working. When the taxation of married women was altered some years
ago, I assumed that the allowance I got for her would be allowable against
her tax allowance, and suggested this to the Inland Revenue, which altered
my tax code but did not comment.
I have been claiming this off her tax allowance for three years, but only
after reminding the IR of it each year.
With my 1992-93 tax code I received a booklet on tax; it says that any
allowance paid to the husband for his wife is taxable to the husband. Is
this correct in my case?
My tax office is far from here, so I cannot discuss the matter with them. If
a mistake was made, could I be advised to accept things as they are, in case
the IR demand repayment for past years?
The allowance in respect of your dependent wife is payable to you (not to
your wife), and is consequently your own income (not hers). There is nothing
in the tax legislation that deems this part of your income to be your
wife's, so we are puzzled why you thought that it should be reported as part
of your wife's income. It looks as though you have misled the tax office as
to whose income it was (and is), so you may have made yourself liable to
penalties, as well as interest payable.
On the bare facts outlined, we recommend that you report the correct facts
to your tax office at once, before it finds out for itself and contacts you
for an explanation.
If, however, you consider that your tax office has at all times been in
possession of the full facts, and you wish to dispute its right to reopen
past years, you should write to the Inland Revenue Public Enquiry Room,
Somerset House, Strand, London, WC2R 1LB, and ask for a copy of SP8/9l
(Discovery assessments). That statement of practice (SP) does not cover
cases where there may have been negligence by the taxpayer, so you have to
decide whether you think that they could reasonably regard your
correspondence as having been based upon negligence in not checking the tax
rules first.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
IN 1973, I bought a builders' yard and buildings, but not the entrance road,
which is unadopted and serves other properties including one still owned by
the owners of the road. I was given right of way over the full width of the
road way, but because of the parking restriction now being enforced, more
people are parking in this entrance. On one side of the right of way these
cars park at right angles to the roadway, sometimes well out, which has made
it impossible for builders' merchants' lorries to deliver materials to our
premises. The owners of this road say the advice they have been given is
that it is up to us to take legal action. We have been advised that it is
the owners' responsibility.
We offered to pay for wheel-clamping: this was turned down by the owners,
who requested that we put up a 'no parking' sign. We argued that this would
not work - and so it has proved. Who is normally responsible for this
situation? If vehicles have parked in this entrance for a number of years
could they claim a permanent right to do so?
If the parking, particularly at right angles, substantially interferes with
your use of the right of way you do have a cause of action against the
individuals who park there, even if there are some who also claim to have a
right of way. You should invite your solicitors to consider seeking
injunctions and damages based on the principles in Celsteel Ltd v Alton
House Ltd 1985 1 WLR 205 (not affected on this point by the later appeal).

FT  04 APR 92 / Minding Your Own Business: Afloat on the tides of a
recession - Nick Garnett meets a man who reacted to redundancy by buying a
company
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICK GARNETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STATISTICAL tables of the unemployed are littered with countless senior
managers pushed on to the street by company restructuring and recession. But
recession also spells shrunken asset values and the opportunity of acquiring
tiny production businesses at low cost.
Chris Ward found himself out of work in the middle of 1990 when he was made
redundant from his job as managing director of the UK domestic products
division of the Hicksons group. Six months on and Ward was a boat builder,
the owner of a tiny yard near the Norfolk Broads making cruisers, motor
yachts and catamarans and fitting out lifeboats and other vessels. It cost
him Pounds 79,000 to buy.
It is hardly Swan Hunter but it gives 40-year-old Ward a new perspective on
life. 'What you have is freedom to design your own strategy for the business
and implement that unencumbered by boardroom politics. I like being involved
with boats but had no experience of running a boat-building business.'
The downside of paltry asset values, though, is feeble demand. 'It's a bad
time to be in any business. It makes the potential new boat buyer very wary,
not because they have lost money in the recession but because they are
hanging on to it in case their own business gets into trouble.'
Ward has felt it necessary to inject a further Pounds 35,000 of his own
money, mainly to cover part of the cost of building a particular style of
motor yacht as the yard's own product which is yet to find a buyer. He has
been a keen sailor for a long time; his own sailing yacht is moored in the
marina at Ipswich where he lives. 'I started looking for a business
connected with the marine industry,' he said.
An advert caught his eye in Yachting Monthly, for a yard in one of those
dreary places near Lowestoft, an hour's drive away. The owner wanted Pounds
50,000 cash, a further Pounds 50,000 over five years. A one-off cash price
was eventually agreed. Ward coughed up Pounds 50,000 immediately; the
balance of Pounds 29,000 was supplied by National Westminster bank without a
visit to the yard, but with Ward's business prospectus.
What Ward got for his money was a company, Crown Fletcher (he renamed it
Crown Fletcher Boat Builders), with a boat-making name since 1906, a
building housing five boat bays on a 21 year lease, equipment like bandsaws
and steam machinery to bend wood into shape, and a workforce of six
craftsmen and an apprentice.
The business, he says, generated a turnover of Pounds 250,000 in the last
year before he bought it, though over Pounds 100,000 of this derived from
buying-in, then using, raw materials. It made a pre-tax profit of Pounds
12,000. He bought the yard in January last year. Since then it has turned
over Pounds 203,000 and made a profit of Pounds 18,000.
The yard can build complete wooden vessels from the keel upwards, usually
using Columbian pine, teak and mahogany, as well as fitting out fibreglass
vessels whose hulls are supplied from outside.
Ward has so far taken out no salary and has pumped in that further Pounds
35,000. It has been hard work. He leaves home at 6.30 am and returns in the
evening.
'I bought the yard because it had a good level of skills, access directly
from the sea, and from Oulton Broads through a lock, and because it had a
record of supplying and refitting lifeboats.'
The company came with a 62-year-old foreman who helped Ward find his sea
legs in costing jobs. Ward also had a stroke of luck when John Perryman, a
professional boat designer and naval architect once employed by Crown
Fletcher, offered his services, bringing two orders in his back pocket.
'When I bought the yard it didn't have a designer,' Ward says. 'It was doing
a lot on subcontract. I probably could have used a third party designer but
it makes you more competitive having someone on the premises. For some
vessels we can design it, price it and do a bill of specification in four
days. Without John's skills we would have struggled to break into the new
boat build market.'
Since Ward bought the company, Crown Fletcher has built a 60-seat catamaran
for Pounds 70,000, using a fibreglass hull, and is part way through a 41
foot all-wooden traditional Broads cruiser, sold for well over Pounds
100,000. It has also refitted two large lifeboats. Ward is trying to switch
the yard towards more wooden boat building and refit work and away from
buying-in fibreglass hulls.
Boat building is a competitive industry, much more so now the market for new
boats has slid by more than 30 per cent.
'Almost every job comes from competitive tendering,' Ward says. 'Normally
the buyer goes for the cheapest yard. Over the long term that is not good
because it is mainly marginal profits.'
Trying to circumnavigate this problem, Ward acquired a fibreglass mould and
produced a hull for what will be the yard's own product, a 32 foot motor
yacht.
'Part of our strategy is to develop something of our own to get out of all
this competitive tendering.' This vessel though, which is part finished and
with a price tag of Pounds 105,000, has no buyer yet, and is absorbing some
of Ward's personal cash.
Avoiding the odd sour contract is also tricky.
'We had a Pounds 60,000 job in the yard before Christmas to repair a
burnt-out fishing boat, but the owner's bank foreclosed on the proceeds of
the insurance policy. So we had sewn up four months work for two people and
found ourselves without that job through no fault of our own. We got our
costs back, but that was small compared with Pounds 60,000.'
Ward has found that company and family are entwined when running a new
venture. 'After the recession my expectation is that the yard will provide a
good living. But like all business ventures, you have to put a lot in to get
a lot out. What you need is a totally committed wife who understands all the
risks when you take on a venture.'

FT  04 APR 92 / Minding Your Own Business: The other side of the ledger -
Computing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID CARTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A RECENT survey found that 52 per cent of purchasers bought their new
computer to do the accounts, principally the sales and purchase ledger. But
readers wanting to put their accounts on to computer should be aware that a
new generation of sales and purchase ledger packages is in the pipeline.
Traditionally, these two ledgers are used for credit control. A sales ledger
will record your credit sales invoices and group them in customer order. The
credit controller can then simply look up the customer's 'account' on the
screen to see which invoices are overdue for payment and need chasing.
When a cheque is received from the customer, the computer matches it to an
invoice or group of invoices, clearing them from the ledger and keeping an
accurate record of paid and unpaid invoices for this customer.
The purchase ledger does the same thing with purchase invoices from
suppliers.
Credit control is largely the province of the accounts department. However,
those sales and purchase invoices also contain information vital for your
sales and purchasing staff. For example, suppose you issue sales invoice 999
on March 25 1992 to customer XYZ Caterers, as follows:
'Spoon, serial no 123: Pounds 25
Knife, serial no 456: Pounds 35
Food mixer, serial no 789: Pounds 40
VAT at 17.5 per cent: Pounds 17.50'
When recording this invoice, a typical sales ledger package will ask you to
allocate the value of each of the four invoice lines to an account in the
nominal ledger.
This 'analysis to the nominal' helps the accountant produce his month-end
accounts. Otherwise the four individual detail lines are ignored, and it
will post a summary of the invoice to XYZ Catering's account, perhaps as
follows:
'25/03/92 999 sale at Pounds 117.50.'
This summary is all the credit control staff need to know. But while the
serial number of the food mixer may be of no interest to them, it may be
important to the service department. And all the detail is interesting to
the sales staff. A year later they might look at this customer and decide it
is about time they tried to persuade him to upgrade his food mixer or to add
a fork to his knife and spoon.
Your sales invoices are the source documents for everything you have ever
sold. The new-type sales ledger invites you to enter the sales invoice line
by line, not just in summary. The aim is to capture that sales information
at the invoice entry stage, and to catch it in the greatest possible detail,
thereby enabling you to build up a sales history database which you can
retain on file for as long as you like - years if necessary.
I have seen one or two systems which retain this detailed information. You
can call up a customer sales history and at the touch of a button see the
sales invoices not just in summary form, but broken down into an item by
item history of everything you have sold this customer in the last two
years.
Instead of the computer telling you about your customers merely as debtors,
it now tells you everything about them as customers.
This applies equally to purchases and the purchase ledger. As you enter a
supplier's invoice for 20 of Item X, the computer can automatically look up
the last price at which you bought Item X and display it, enabling you to
confirm that the price on the invoice is correct.
It is only within the last year or two that unlimited disk storage has made
these sales and purchase histories feasible. Perhaps the best example of the
new ledgers is Business Manager, released by Pegasus last September. It
costs only Pounds 299. Anyone who has their accounts on computer should
consider buying it just to see the future of business software.
Until now sales and purchase ledgers have been simple, humdrum affairs run
by the accounts department, but once the sales and purchasing people realise
what the new ledgers can do, they are not going to stay that way for long.
Accounts packages are much too important to be left to the accounts staff.
Pegasus Business Manager, Pounds 299, is available from Pegasus Budget
Software, 0536-415522. It requires a 286 PC with 1 megabyte of memory.

FT  04 APR 92 / Finance and The Family (The Election and You): The tax cost
of party gifts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ALTHOUGH the political parties have an apparently insatiable appetite for
funds, the tax system gives surprisingly little encouragement to political
donors. There are few tax breaks for individuals and none for companies.
Neither the real nor phantom Budgets proposed relaxations.
A casual student of British tax law might be struck by the apparent
similarities in the treatment of political and charitable donations.
First, both are exempted from inheritance tax. The qualification for a
political party is undemanding - two MPs returned at the last election, or a
single MP combined with a national vote of at least 150,000. Since small
gifts will be covered by exemptions and life-time gifts fall outside the IHT
net provided the donor survives for seven years, the only conceivable
relevance of this concession is if a person leaves a political bequest in
their will.
Second, gifts to political parties can be 'rolled-over' for capital gains
tax purposes. This means that, provided both donor and party make a written
election to the Inland Revenue, the donor pays no tax but the party takes on
the donor's original CGT base value.
Suppose that as a gesture of gratitude for the government's privatisation
programme, Sid decides to donate to the Tory party 1,000 shares in British
Telecom which cost him Pounds 2,000 but have risen in value to Pounds 3,000.
In the unlikely event that the Conservatives felt it politic to hold a stake
in BT, and assuming the shares are subsequently sold for Pounds 4,000, the
Tories would be taxable on a gain of Pounds 2,000 (Pounds 4,000-Pounds
2,000). Had Sid sold his shares and then donated the proceeds, his gift
would have been reduced by 40 per cent CGT to just Pounds 2,600. This way he
is able to pass on the full Pounds 3,000 value. The Revenue is unable to
estimate the annual cost to the Exchequer of these two rather obscure
concessions.
The analogy with charitable giving breaks down when it comes to income tax.
Whereas philanthropists can obtain full income tax relief for their
donations - whether by deed of covenant or, for larger sums, under the Gift
Aid scheme - there is no equivalent for political contributions.
If Sid wants to support John Major with cash rather than BT shares he will
have to do so out of his after-tax income. Assuming he is a higher-rate
taxpayer, a Pounds 3,000 gift will cost Sid Pounds 5,000 of gross earnings -
rising to more than Pounds 7,300 if the Labour Party are in a position to
implement their 59 per cent top rate of income tax and national insurance.
In practice, the majority of those who make political gifts probably do so
indirectly as shareholders in companies. Under the Companies Act, donations
for political purposes must be disclosed in a company's accounts; hence the
recent rumpus over the failure of Asil Nadir's Poly Peck International to
inform its hapless shareholders of a Pounds 100,000 boost to Tory coffers.
Disclosure is required, shareholder approval is not. Nevertheless, a number
of companies put their political contributions to the vote. Continuing the
apparent link between political generosity and ultimate financial ruin, the
collapsed conglomerate, British &amp; Commonwealth, was the first to take the
democratic plunge. A number of companies now seek express authority from
their shareholders before making political payments.
Whether or not they consult in this way, companies who have helped to pay
for the current election campaign should not expect any help at all from the
Revenue. It feels that political donations can never be deducted from
profits for corporation tax purposes.
Denial of relief is not a result of a specific statutory provision. Instead,
the taxman's thumbs-down is based on an interpretation of the general rule
that corporate expenditure is only deductible if incurred wholly and
exclusively to benefit the company's trade.
Although companies donating to the Conservative party - the beneficiary of
virtually all corporate donations - doubtless believe that a fourth Tory
term would be good for business, that is too remote a connection to satisfy
the deductibility test.

FT  04 APR 92 / Finance and The Family (The Election and You): Tax the heir,
not the estate - Cedric Sandford on the alternatives to IHT
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CEDRIC SANDFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE NATION arguably faces an even clearer choice over inheritance tax in the
election than it does over income tax. The future form, level and even
existence of death duties could depend on the result.
As Norman Lamont, the chancellor, confirmed in the Budget, the Conservatives
want to diminish death duties - and possibly even abolish them.
This may seem odd measured against the Conservative philosophy of rewarding
people according to their contribution. The entrepreneur who makes Pounds 1m
because the gadget he sells delights millions of people, deserves his
reward. But what does the person who inherits Pounds 1m contribute?
Since 1979 the Tories have whittled away at the Capital Transfer Tax (CTT)
they inherited and in the process introduced inequities so manifest that
they made the abolition of the tax all the easier. CTT was a death and gift
tax, levied on the donor with progressive rates up to a maximum of 75 per
cent.
Sir Geoffrey Howe and Nigel Lawson, previous Tory chancellors, cut rates,
raised thresholds, reduced the period in which gifts and estates were
aggregated for tax purposes and increased business and agricultural
concessions.
In 1986, Lawson allowed gifts between individuals to be completely untaxed
if made within seven years before death, and renamed what was left of CTT
'Inheritance Tax'. In doing so he flouted established terminology by which
'inheritance tax' is used for a tax on the donee and 'estate duty' for a tax
on the donor.
Presumably he did not wish to acknowledge that, essentially, he was bringing
back the former estate duty, which had lost all credibility as a 'voluntary
tax'.
In 1988 he abolished the higher rates of IHT, reducing it to a single rate
of 40 per cent.
Formally this is progressive, because the threshold takes up a higher
proportion of a small estate, so the average rate of tax is higher for the
larger than the smaller estate. But it is doubtful if IHT is effectively
progressive.
If the very rich own private businesses or farms, they benefit from reliefs.
If they do not, much of their wealth is likely to be in a form enabling them
to make tax-avoiding gifts, while more modest wealth-owners will have most
of their wealth tied up in houses and be much less well-placed to make
gifts.
The seven-year gifts provision is a state-created lottery with life, with
perverse consequences. Suppose two men of the same age and wealth make
similar gifts at the same time. One falls under a bus the next day while the
other survives. The family more likely to need relief is that of the man who
died soonest, not that of the survivor. Yet it is on the former's gift that
duty is paid.
Reliefs on private businesses and agricultural assets are inequitable, and
of dubious economic value. If the Tories win, interests in unincorporated
businesses, holdings above 25 per cent in unquoted and USM companies,
owner-occupied farm lands and farm tenancies will be 100 per cent relieved
of IHT while other business assets, including let farm land, will be 50 per
cent relieved. But there is no reason, from economics or eugenics, to
believe that the children of a successful entrepreneur or farmer are persons
best equipped to succeed them.
The reliefs will tend to be capitalised in the asset prices to the benefit
of existing holders: tax avoidance will be encouraged, bringing into
industry or land ownership those more interested in tax relief than economic
efficiency; and less businesses and farms will come on to the market,
reducing the opportunities of enterprising aspirants.
It may be argued that the reliefs offer incentives to existing owners, who
are motivated by passing on their business or farm to the next generation.
But this is far from obvious.
Many successful entrepreneurs have no children, so this cannot motivate
them, while research suggests that 'inheritors' are much less dynamic than
founders. The prospect of a large inheritance may demotivate the potential
inheritor.
The UK is the only OECD country which fails to support a death duty with a
regular gift tax, and which gives such big reliefs for agricultural and
business assets.
What is the alternative? The Liberal Democrats have long advocated a
donee-based tax to be charged at cumulative rates on receipts from gifts and
legacies from any donor - often called an accessions tax. Labour also
recognises the merits of an accessions tax and a Labour government would
probably substitute one for the IHT.
An accessions tax, besides getting rid of the nonsense of the seven-year
rule, has two advantages over the IHT. First, it is more equitable because
it taxes directly in relation to benefit received. Secondly, it should be
more effective in reducing concentrations of wealth. An accessions tax
offers an incentive to the wealthy to spread their wealth; if it is given or
left to those who have received little by gifts or legacies, the amount of
tax is reduced.
More significantly, a tax on receipts strikes at the heart of the problem,
because large receipts, not large estates as such, perpetuate inequality. A
change from IHT to an accessions tax would increase administrative costs,
but that seems a small price to pay for the benefits. The Irish Government
made the change from estate duty to accessions tax some years ago and have
been well pleased with the outcome.
Professor Sandford was formerly Director of the Centre for Fiscal Studies of
the University of Bath.

SYLVIA and Len Biles live on Pounds 121.18 per week. That comes from Len's
state pension, plus an immobility allowance.
Both are retired, although neither of them has yet reached the state
retirement age - Len is 64, and Sylvia 56.
Neither of them works because neither is able to. Len has been disabled for
eight years since an operation on his leg went seriously wrong. He finds it
difficult to get about, and the heating in the couple's council house needs
to be kept high to allow his leg to stay stiffened.
Sylvia has a congenital hip disorder, which made it impossible for her to
carry on her job as a chef nearly 20 years ago.
However, she does not qualify for disability allowances or pensions, because
she is not receiving continuous treatment for her condition. To her fury,
she even recently received a request to pay for National Insurance
contributions, to boost her pension when she receives it. She needs it now.
Labour's pledge to put Pounds 8 on a married couple's pension over and above
inflation might therefore be seen as good news for the couple - it would
increase their weekly income by 6.5 per cent. But they are unenthusiastic.
Mrs Biles is a pillar of the local community and runs two social clubs for
old age pensioners. Most of their members, like Mrs Biles, still distrust
Labour after their experience in 1974-79.
The first point she makes is that Labour cut the Christmas bonus for
pensioners in the winter of 1975 to 1976. And the Conservatives are
committed to raising pensions in the autumn. Also, pensioners are acutely
conscious of inflation.
Prices generally make their rises for the year in April, according to Mrs
Biles, and she has noticed them. 'You go back to the shop from one day to
the next, and the price of a carton of milk has gone up from 47p to 57p.
Where can you find money for that?'
That price rise happened under the Tories. But unfortunately for Labour, the
couple believes that further inflationary rises like this would rub out the
advantages they gain from the pension increase.
Certainly, inflation on the scale of seen in the last Wilson government
would cut their standard of living. However, most City analysts are
confident that the discipline of the European Exchange Rate Mechanism would
avoid a return to 25 per cent inflation.
The couple cannot be said to have benefited much from the new Thatcherite
prosperity - they did not have enough money to buy the council house in
which they have lived for 30 years, so the 'right to buy' did not help.
But one incident impressed them. Heating has been one of their greatest
problems, due to Len's medical condition. During one bitterly cold snap
their electricity bill for the quarter was Pounds 200. The Tories provided
some relief. Mr Biles says: 'They were the first government to give us
Pounds 2 a week when it was cold.'
The junior minister responsible for granting the pay-out was John Major. As
a man from Brixton, not far from the Biles' home in Waddon, near Croydon,
they are inclined to trust him, even though the economists suggest they
would be better off under Labour.

NIGEL TAPLEY is a director of a renowned City investment bank, where typical
annual salaries hover around Pounds 100,000. People on this level of
earnings will be hit hard by Labour's tax plans. These include a new tax
band of 50 per cent on income greater than Pounds 40,000 and lifting the
ceiling on National Insurance contributions, which will effectively add 9
per cent to the marginal rate of tax.
Tapley, whose salary is 'comfortably into the proposed new tax band' is not
sanguine about the prospect of seeing his marginal rate rise from 40 per
cent to 59 per cent (income and NIC) under a Labour government, with the
loss of about one third of his present marginal income.
'I'm worried because I think that the very basis on which Labour puts its
tax proposals forward is flawed,' says Tapley. 'Taking so much from the top
slice and giving it to the lower slice is flawed. For example, I won't be
able to do up the house, spend money on carpets and curtains  - this is
money which would have gone back into the economy.'
Tapley, who lives with his wife in a four-bedroomed flat in Knightsbridge,
counts himself lucky that with children aged one and five he is not paying
expensive school fees. 'I've got to save to pay for those fees and it will
be that much more difficult to save'. But, 'like many of my generation, the
last thing I would cut back on is education.'
Instead, it is the luxuries that will be affected. The Tapleys have a
live-in housekeeper, paid Pounds 500 a month, to look after the children.
'The likelihood is that she would have to go. We don't have a second car or
a second home, which is just as well, because they would probably have to
go, too.'
His wife, who is American, usually spends the summers with the children in
the US. They spent last summer in Italy - 'a holiday like that would be out
of the question because it is that very slug of disposable income - spent
not saved - that would disappear.'
His hobbies include golf and shooting. He says he would continue with the
golf but would probably give up shooting, which is more expensive.
'I'm not rich. I earn my money and if I didn't have a job, I wouldn't have
any money,' says Tapley who, apart from some endowment policies, has little
savings. He says he does not mind paying tax at present levels but a Labour
government would mean 'you are working for the taxman and not yourself.'
He has not needed to look at tax avoidance measures, such as trusts for the
children or offshore funds, 'but I will now. It was something I would not
consider before but it will be high on the agenda.'
His position under a Labour government would still be better than many
others. 'Fortunately I'm not a member of Lloyd's - a lot of my friends are
going to have a double whammy there.'
He believes that the economic policies of a Labour government would fail.
'Any jump out of recession has to mean restoring the confidence of the
consumer. Take that away and recovery won't happen.'

FT  04 APR 92 / Finance and The Family (The Election and You): The fund
managers - an eye to the future
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HEATHER FARMBROUGH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE October 1987 stock market crash had the side effect of sorting out good
fund managers from bad. Some fell by the wayside while others flourished.
The managers described here are some of the most promising in Britain and
were chosen on the grounds of reputation and performance. Most emphasised
that good performance is often the result of collective wisdom, back-up from
colleagues and a sensible asset allocation policy. But individual judgment
and personality clearly is crucial.
Quite a few of those interviewed here have left their training ground
recently and it will be interesting to see if they can perform as well on
their own.
Nicola Horlick was one who thrived at Mercury Asset Management, which she
joined in 1983. Initially, she ran balanced UK portfolios - large funds with
widespread, fairly evenly-weighted holdings. In the mid-1980s, however,
pension fund portfolios increasingly were managed by taking a core satellite
of stocks, possibly indexed, as a base and leaving the rest of the portfolio
as a more specialist section under 'active' management.
Horlick, 31, helped to build up the specialist portfolio business. But as
the operation became bigger, she was attracted by a fresh challenge at
Morgan Grenfell, where she is again managing and marketing specialist
portfolios.
She prefers to run relatively highly-concentrated portfolios and says: 'If I
have a fund of Pounds 100m, I would have about 40 stocks.' Wendy Mayall, of
pension fund consultant Stamford Associates UK, says that Horlick has
achieved investment returns in the top five per cent of managers in her
field since the mid-1980s.
Andrew Parry is the 29-year-old head of UK equities at Baring Asset
Management. He is a maths graduate who became an actuarial trainee with
Confederated Life before a brief spell in the international private client
department of stockbroker Grieveson Grant.
He then spent three years in the Swiss Bank Corporation's relatively small
investment department before moving to Baring in 1988 as a UK pension fund
manager and now has 15 managers reporting to him.
Parry could well have succeeded in reversing Baring's disappointing
performance late in the 1980s. Baring's equity returns last year were 21.2
per cent compared with an industry average of 19.9 per cent, according to
Wood Mackenzie.
Sarah Bates has responsibility for about Pounds 600m of corporate and local
authority pension funds at Invesco MIM. Over the last financial year, two of
her local authority UK equity pension funds ranked fifth and sixth out of
100.
She was an analyst at stockbroker Simon &amp; Coates, but she did not enjoy the
sales side and moved to National Provident Investment Managers to become a
fund manager, before going to MIM in 1985.
Bates studied for her MBA as a part-time student at the London Business
School but retains a healthy scepticism about the qualification. She
believes that 'the days of the old-fashioned fund manager who gets by with
flair and luck are fading.'
Richard Horlick - Nicola's 33-year-old cousin by marriage - works at Newton,
the independent fund management outlet, where he oversees Pounds 200m in
pension fund money out of the total Pounds 2bn under management in pension
funds, unit trusts and personal equity plans. From the results available to
December 1991, 25 of Newton's 31 funds made the top quartile.
He joined Newton in 1983 after leaving Samuel Montagu's corporate finance
department. And, clearly, he enjoys the relatively aggressive and high-risk
approach at Newton.
Mick Brewis, 27 and a Cambridge graduate, has established a reputation with
Edinburgh fund manager Baillie Gifford, which manages Pounds 2bn in UK
equities. His smaller companies unit trust leads its sector over two years,
a fact he attributes to the firm's philosophy of buying only well-managed,
successful companies. He prefers to be in Edinburgh because 'you can take a
more objective view without being caught up by market fashions.'
Kevin Rowe, 30, has a different approach; he uses quantitative computer
techniques to assess risks and returns. As a founder member of Buchanan
Partners, a small, independent outlet set up two years ago, he also helped
to establish Credit Suisse First Boston's proprietary trading department.
Investors subscribe to Buchanan's funds, which are arbitraged on markets in
Europe and the Far East. The annual return on Buchanan's equity investments
last year was 40 per cent. Rowe, a Canadian, graduated from Toronto and took
a master's degree in finance at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
Stephen Whittaker operates from a base in Henley, Oxfordshire, where he
manages three UK unit trusts - Growth, PEP Growth and Income and Offshore UK
Growth - at Perpetual, another independent fund management group. UK Growth
ranks 12th out of all UK unit trust growth funds over the past two years,
according to Finstat. Whittaker is also in charge of the UK investment team.
He joined Rowan, the in-house fund management operation of stockbrokers Rowe
&amp; Pitman, in 1980. Five years later he went to Save &amp; Prosper unit trusts,
where he moved away from the more general 'bread and butter' funds to
specialist unit trusts.
Michael Taylor, 31, is one of the most down-to-earth managers in the City
and distrusts 'anything flashy.' He says: 'My basic approach is that the UK
economy is in terminal decline, certainly in the manufacturing sector.'
After a grounding at Guardian Royal Exchange, Taylor ran pension funds for
four years at Hill Samuel, staying well into the top 15 per cent over the
period and often in the top 10. Since moving to Royal Insurance Asset
Management as head of equities last May, there has been a marked upturn in
UK equity performance (although Taylor points out that this had started
before he joined). He also manages Royal Life's main life and annuity
business fund himself.
The problem with fund management is that successful managers spend less time
managing money and more on marketing. The trick is to do both. The next five
years should show who has managed.

FT  04 APR 92 / Finance and The Family (The Election and You): Good news
hits M&amp;G launch
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
M&amp;G MUST think that every silver lining has a cloud.
The group announced this week that the launch of its Recovery investment
trust had raised Pounds 129.8m. This was the second biggest investment trust
launch, beaten only by M&amp;G's own Income trust, launched last October.
The figure fell far short of expectations - M&amp;G had aimed to raise at least
Pounds 300m, with capacity for Pounds 1bn. However, the shortfall was thanks
to two items of excellent news for M&amp;G and the rest of the fund management
industry.
Managers had long called for the annual limit on investment and unit trust
Personal Equity Plans to be raised to Pounds 6,000. In the Budget on March
10 they at last got their wish.
Pep providers have also been running scared of a return to power by Labour,
which at one time seemed set on abolishing the plans. But on February 13,
the party made clear it would keep Peps in the short-term, and expand them
in the longer term.
This was excellent news for the fund management industry. But it was bad
news for the Recovery trust, which was launched to exploit a loophole for
newly launched investment trusts and timed to allow investment in both tax
years 1991-92 and 1992-93, thus protecting against Labour.
M&amp;G had expected heavier investment for 1992-93 because demand for this year
had already been soaked up by its Income trust. In the event, the group took
more money for 1991-92. Next year, the option of putting Pounds 6,000 in a
unit trust Pep, with no risk of sinking to a discount, or in an investment
trust Pep, where bargains might be available if shares are already at a
discount, will look much more appealing.
M&amp;G admitted that the final returns were disappointing, but pointed out that
the group had in six months completed the two biggest investment trust
launches yet. Roger Jennings, marketing manager, said he was convinced that
investors would be pleased with the trust's performance, and that the timing
had been right to buy 'recovery' stocks.

FT  04 APR 92 / Finance and The Family (The Election and You): Stay of
execution surprises marketeers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LABOUR this week took the wind out of the sails of several BES marketeers by
announcing a stay of execution for the scheme, writes John Authers. Labour
confirmed that 'abolition of the BES will not be backdated'. This removes
one element of risk for schemes which aim to allot shares by election day.
The party added: 'Given the current state of the housing market the Labour
chancellor would be prepared to act flexibly. As BES abolition was not set
out in the Shadow Budget this will not be regarded as a priority for
immediate change.'
Tim Villiers, chairman of the BES Association, welcomed this as excellent
news, and said the scheme would probably survive until the second Budget of
a Labour administration.
However, this lessens the incentive to make a hasty investment in a BES for
the 1992-93 tax year.
Several schemes remain open for this form of investment. including Bessa
Plus, which is sponsored by Close Brothers, and has a covenant from Hill
Samuel Personal Finance to buy back shares in five year at a price of Pounds
1.25 for Pounds 1 spent now, and Short Leasehold, sponsored by Terrace Hill,
which aims for high growth and also high yields by buying short leasehold
properties.

FT  04 APR 92 / Finance and The Family (The Election and You): The challenge
to buy-backs - David Ross on some of the pitfalls involved with BES schemes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID ROSS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WITH THE approach of the new tax year, not to mention the general election,
BES schemes are being aggressively marketed by many sponsors.
'Buy-back' schemes are the most popular but they are under challenge from
companies which plan to invest in residential property acquired from
distressed sellers, company receivers or lenders who have repossessed
houses.
The financial press has rightly warned of the risks this strategy involves,
but to investors the presence of such risks implies the possibility of
attractive returns.
Some potential pitfalls are obvious - for example the uncertain outlook for
the property market, and the fact that such properties must by law be let
out on the basis of assured tenancies, thus providing security of tenure to
the occupier.
There has been little comment on an area of great uncertainty, and possibly
of greatest risk to the potential investor - the possible conflict of
interest between investors and the managers of the company. Such conflicts
may not be uncommon.
Most investors will want to liquidate their holdings within five or six
years, hopefully securing a useful return on their money in the process. But
this might not suit the managers, whose objective may be less clear cut.
They might want to use the BES as a source of capital for a company which
they envisage continuing for many years. If so, then the first question for
the investor to ask is how he gets his money back.
If it is proposed that this should be achieved by a sale or flotation of the
company, then he should be aware that this is only likely to be achieved at
a substantial discount to the value of the underlying assets. Many quoted
residential property companies are priced at discounts of around 50 per cent
to the estimated value of the assets. That disincentive is hefty enough, but
in fact it understates the problem, because the asset value is itself below
the value at which the underlying properties could be sold if vacant
possession could be obtained.
This discrepancy between valuation and achievable cash proceeds, makes it
desirable that the remuneration of the management should be linked to the
cash eventually returned to the investors, and not to a professional
estimate of the value of underlying properties.
The ideal solution would be to let the properties to tenants who could be
expected to quit before the date when investors want to liquidate their
assets. In that case the properties could be sold with vacant possession -
in other words, at the best available market price.
Failing that, the return to the investor will suffer from the discount that
prospective purchasers will demand on negotiating for a property with a
sitting tenant. Once tenants realise that the management company has an
interest in their vacating the property at a particular date, they may seek
compensation for doing so. In that case, the full vacant possession price
will not be achieved, and the investor's return will again be eroded, though
not by so much as would be the case if the tenant remained in situ.
Even if the remuneration of managers were treated in the way proposed, there
are still potential problems. Most schemes define this remuneration in terms
of the return achieved in excess of a predetermined target. If this target
looks unlikely to be met, then there is an obvious disincentive to the
managers. There are then three main choices:
the managers may continue to manage in a lacklustre fashion, concentrating
their efforts on better opportunities elsewhere;
they may simply resign;
or they may seek to renegotiate the terms of their contract.
None of these alternatives is likely to work to the investor's advantage,
and the third is likely to erode their eventual return, either directly or
indirectly. Even if none of these dangers materialise, a further conflict of
interest may arise if the managers offer to buy out the investors: in such
circumstances they may not be best motivated to find attractive offers for
the assets from possible alternative buyers]
One way to avoid, or at least minimise, the impact of such conflicts would
be the appointment of strong-minded and independent directors charged with
protecting the interest of investors. Regrettably, only a small minority of
companies has adopted this approach.
Ultimately, the major safeguard is the desire of sponsor companies to retain
an unsullied reputation among investors and investment professionals. Some
sponsors, controlled by larger insurance companies or investment advisers,
may have a stronger incentive in this direction than others.
Many such organisations have concentrated their attention on 'buy-back'
schemes, which are safer and less controversial. This is unfortunate,
because of the depressed state of the housing market.

FT  04 APR 92 / Finance &amp; The Family (The Election and You): Tax, what the
parties are planning for you - But will it hurt your wallet or leave you
with a smile come election day? Scheherazade Daneshkhu and John Authers
examine the figures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The general election campaign has transformed the arid subject of personal
finance into a heated political issue. Both leading parties have made
sweeping claims: Labour says its plans would make 'eight out of 10'
taxpayers better off while the Conservatives reply that everyone would pay
an annual average of Pounds 1,250 more under Labour.
They cannot both be right. Indeed, accountant Coopers &amp; Lybrand Deloitte
concluded this week that all parties - including the Liberal Democrats -
would have to raise income tax to meet their spending programmes.
So what exactly will the parties do to the tax system if they win next
Thursday? Labour and the Liberal Democrats both intend to alter the tax
structure and make it more redistributive in order to fund social security
and education. The Conservatives want to expand the 20 per cent basic-rate
income tax band introduced in the Budget.
But it is not only income tax which determines your disposable income.
Increases in state funding for health, education and benefits will also make
a material difference to most people. VAT at 17.5 per cent eats into
disposable income while direct taxation other than income tax - including
capital gains and inheritance tax - have had less publicity.
With less than a week before election day, here is a quick guide to the
parties' plans.
Income tax
In his election Budget, Norman Lamont introduced a 20 per cent tax band on
the first Pounds 2,000 of earnings. The dual aim was to further the Tory
goal of lowering taxes - and to squeeze Labour by stressing how the move
would benefit the lower-paid. But the total saving is only Pounds 100 a year
and it is not targeted just at the low-paid; everybody will get reduced tax
bills. Lamont said this week the recession meant there would be little room
for further cuts until 1995-96.
Labour plans two significant changes in personal taxes. An extra band of
income tax, at 50 per cent, will be added for those earning more than Pounds
40,000 a year. It will abolish the annual ceiling on National Insurance
contributions (NICs).
At present, these are 9 per cent on incomes up to Pounds 20,280. Under
Labour, they would be paid at this rate on all annual income - effectively
increasing by 9 per cent the marginal rate of tax for all those earning more
than this figure. The combined effect of these measures would be painful for
people earning in excess of Pounds 30,000.
But Labour also plans to raise thresholds, benefitting the lower-paid
especially. Plans to levy NICs on investment income have been dropped. The
party does not intend to abolish tax-exempt special savings accounts
(Tessas) or personal equity plans (Peps).
By far the most ambitious income tax programme comes from the Liberal
Democrats. They would integrate income tax and NICs. The 20 per cent tax
band introduced by Lamont would be abolished and 1p added to the basic rate,
making it 26p.
There would be three tax bands with the basic-rate band - 35 per cent -
applying to earnings up to Pounds 33,000. Between Pounds 33,000-Pounds
50,000, the rate would be 42 per cent. Those earning more than this would
pay 50 per cent (41 per cent income tax and 9 per cent NICs). The party
estimates that 80 per cent of taxpayers would fall into the first band.
Pensioners and small savers would be exempt from NICs and a tax credit
system would replace personal allowances.
Another sweeping change is replacing all savings schemes - such as Peps and
Tessas - with a single savings account which would get tax relief and into
which savings for pensions also would go. Labour intends moving in this
direction as well, but its plans are much less clear-cut.
Capital gains tax
The Tories hope eventually to abolish CGT and the Conservative Way Forward
group has called on Lamont to reduce the rate at which it is paid. But he
played safe in the Budget and simply raised the annual exemption in line
with inflation from Pounds 5,500 (for what is left of the present tax year)
to Pounds 5,800 for 1992-92.
CGT was introduced in its present form by the first Labour government of
Harold Wilson. It could reach its nemesis under a Kinnock Labour
administration, which would make the amount of CGT payable depend on the
length of time a share had been held. Those who retained their assets for a
long period would pay less tax than those aiming to make quick profits by
short-term 'stagging.'
This could be done by imposing two, or possibly three, tiers of taxation.
Plainly, such a system would encourage long-term investment, in line with
Labour's desire to stimulate industry. But Labour has committed itself to
the reform only over the long term - the reason being its great complexity,
which might open the way for accountants to devise avoidance schemes.
Labour's short-term plans are more prosaic. The CGT threshold will come down
to something nearer the threshold for income tax - probably less than Pounds
4,000. This would be chargeable at the payer's top rate of income tax,
subject to a maximum of 40 per cent.
Labour has consistently denied its opponents' claim that the threshold would
be reduced to Pounds 1,000. Margaret Beckett, the party's treasury
spokeswoman, says this figure is an 'invention.'
The Liberal Democrats would reduce the CGT threshold considerably and
everyone would have a Pounds 2,000 allowance. They would also have a Pounds
2,000 investment income allowance to offset against the 9 per cent tax
element of National Insurance. But transferability of half of an allowance
(Pounds 1,000) from capital gains to income, or vice versa, would be allowed
if either was not used fully.
Inheritance tax
While John Major wants a classless society, he also wants to see 'wealth
cascading down the generations.' This statement, made at the Conservative
conference last year, led many people to expect either the abolition of
inheritance tax (see Professor Cedric Sandford's article on page V) or a
reduction in the IHT rate.
But again, Lamont was cautious in the Budget. He said he intended to raise
the annual exemption by more than inflation from Pounds 140,000 to Pounds
150,000 for the 1992 tax year and promised 'to look for ways of lightening
the burden of inheritance tax.' In the Finance Act, it was indexed to Pounds
147,000.
Labour is planning root-and-branch reform in the other direction. It would
base the tax on the beneficiary, rather than the donor, and assess it on a
lifetime basis, so doing away with the present (and cumbersome) 'potentially
exempt transfers.'
As Sandford explains, this would increase sharply the incentive to
distribute wealth widely, but it is unlikely to happen in John Smith's first
Budget.
Like Labour, the Liberal Democrats want to make the beneficiary, not the
estate, liable for IHT. But their plans are costed more clearly.
This would be one of the few areas in which the wealthy could do better
under a Lib-Dem government because it would be easier to avoid paying IHT.
Each individual would have a Pounds 50,000 IHT exemption. If an heir
received Pounds 150,000, he would have to pay IHT on Pounds 100,000. But if
it was left to three heirs, there would be no IHT. There would be exemptions
or concessions for family businesses. Labour has not hinted what the level
of exemption would be.
Pensions
Thatcherism shook the pensions industry into action. The big change was to
create personal pensions, allowing an alternative to company final-salary
schemes and widening choice substantially for savers.
Personal pensions have many attractions over Serps (the state
earnings-related pension scheme). These include a big rebate of NICs for
those who contract out of Serps, and the possibility of superior investment
performance.
Those already in company schemes can take out additional voluntary
contributions (AVCs) which are, in many respects, similar to personal
pensions and can boost retirement income significantly. AVCs cannot be made
to Serps.
The Tories will reduce the incentive for opting out, but their manifesto
makes clear they aim to ensure personal pensions remain effective.
Labour would take pensions in the opposite direction. For a start, it has
pledged that the basic state pension would rise by Pounds 5 a week for
single people and Pounds 8 for married couples.
Serps would be revamped to offer a pension based on the best 20 years of
earnings - especially useful for those who take a long career break. There
would also be an increase in the maximum earnings that could be taken into
account. Serps would be open to the self-employed and there would be
provision for AVCs.
All of these measures remove advantages now held by personal pensions and
might well lead to many savers moving back into Serps.
The Liberal Democrats plan an immediate improvement in state pensions which
everyone would receive by right. Single pensioners would get Pounds 5 a week
more and married couples Pounds 8. This increase would be funded partly
through the abolition of Serps, although those with Serps entitlements would
receive their pension from it.
In addition, all parties would have to implement equal retirement ages for
men and women following a decision by the European Court. Under the
Lib-Dems, the retirement age would be 65 for both sexes, with a 'flexible
decade of retirement' between the ages of 60 and 70. Labour would also opt
for a flexible decade. The Conservatives are undecided.

FT  04 APR 92 / London Markets: The spectre of a debtor's prison
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
   Peter Martin, Financial Editor
NEAR the FT's office stands an old-fashioned undertakers, all black marble
and gloomy solicitude. In brass lettering, the shop-front offers you a
choice of conveyance - 'Horses, Motors' - for the final journey.
Such a choice, the markets seemed to be saying this week, lies ahead in
Thursday's general election: different ways of reaching the same place, with
discretion limited to speed and style rather than destination.
The likely destination can be found, appropriately enough, just behind the
undertakers' premises, the site of the old Marshalsea debtor's prison. Long
vanished, it is still vividly alive in Dickens's novel, Little Dorritt.
The 20th century equivalent of the Marshalsea is the bind in which the
likely course of government borrowing threatens to leave the British
economy. Moaning over a vanished investment, one of the novel's improvident
speculators sounds as pitiful as any Treasury knight: 'I have gone over it
since it failed, every day of my life, and it comes out - regarded as a
question of figures - triumphant.'
Regarded as a question of figures, alas, there is little triumph to be found
these days. In the March 1991 Budget, points out Nicholas Knight, Nomura's
market strategist, the public sector borrowing requirement in the next
half-decade was put at Pounds 26bn; now, the government hopes to keep it to
Pounds 118bn - a rise of over Pounds 92bn in just 12 months. William Dorritt
spent a lifetime in the Marshalsea for less.
These figures derive from last month's Budget, and explain the slide in
share prices since then. This week, there was a sudden worsening in both
stock and bond markets: the FT-SE index closed down 65.2 points on the week
at 2382.7, and gilt yields have risen from 9 1/2 to 9 3/4 per cent since the
campaign started.
Among shares, there were some specific factors at work. A Pounds 216m loss
from Speyhawk, the property developer, sent its shares down 66 per cent on
the week, to close at 3 3/4 p. Bank shares suffered from this and other
property news, and dropped 7 per cent. But the main influences were
political: opinion polls showing a clear Labour lead.
It was always likely that UK investors would be spooked by this. But the
market's judgment also reflects the growing sense that whatever party forms
the next government will be faced with difficult decisions on economic
policy.
There are some positive signs in the short term. Institutional investors,
both in the UK and abroad, seem to regard the UK markets as undervalued at
their current level.
The charts show why. On the left, the spread between gilts and German bunds
has widened to levels that make the UK securities appealing. On the right,
the ratio of the interest rate on gilts to the yield on ordinary shares has
dropped enough to make equities look more attractive.
Neither of these indicators is yet flashing an unambiguous buy signal: but
they are both providing strong support once the election uncertainties are
out of the way. A clutch of UK institutional investors told one equity
analyst this week that at current prices they would be buyers of stocks
after the election regardless of the outcome.
The problems lie further ahead, and can best be examined by looking at the
City consensus on three possible outcomes of the election:
Conservative minority government. Such a government would be looking for a
quick boost to the economy, followed by a second election. It might just
possibly be tempted into a devaluation this year, if the signs of recovery
seen in the past few weeks failed once again to translate into a real
pick-up in activity.
Labour majority government. With a workable majority, Labour would be
settling in for the long haul. It would be interested in building a solid
basis for recovery, to allow it to be re-elected in mid-decade. So no quick
boost to the economy, other than the limited amount provided in John Smith's
shadow Budget. Enacting Labour's tax plans might prove slightly negative for
economic activity, if it proved as damaging for the south-east as some
economists expect. There might be a possibility of a devaluation later in
the government's life, if stagnation continued long enough to threaten
re-election.
Labour minority government. Expecting a quick second election, and perhaps
also dependent on Liberal Democrat votes, it might choose a modified version
of the Smith tax plan, hitting high-earners less severely. The short term
boost to the economy might be greater than under a Tory minority government,
but devaluation would almost certainly be ruled out this year.
In all three outcomes, the risk is of slow growth in the medium term,
accompanied by a rising PSBR and increasing difficulties in reconciling
domestic economic policy with membership of the European Monetary System.
The ultimate manifestation of this would be the strain of getting government
borrowing down below the level needed to qualify for monetary union.
Any future Chancellor might find his European colleagues lecturing him much
as the luckless Pancks is bullied in Little Dorritt: 'You must be much
sharper with the people, sir. You don't squeeze them. Your receipts are not
up to the mark. You must squeeze them, sir . . . Duty, duty; squeeze on
Monday, squeeze, squeeze, squeeze]'
Happy voting]

There could, alas, be strong demand for a new product from DBS Assured

of her ex-husband, even without his knowledge or consent. As life insurance
is rarely high on people's minds amid the acrimony of a divorce, any joint
protection plans a couple may have taken out often lapse. The policy is
underwritten at Lloyd's, and the protection costs Pounds 4.50 for every
Pounds 1,000 sum assured.

Shearson Lehman Brothers launched a new guaranteed equity investment this

FT-SE falls, investors will receive their original capital back.
The FT-SE Fixed Assured Note (FAN) allows investors to choose to be repaid
at a certain level, if they feel the FT-SE has peaked, and there will also
be a secondary market in the notes which should give investors another

1992 has so far been a dreadful year for Japanese equities, as the fall in
the Nikkei-Dow index shows. The Bank of Japan cut the base rate by 0.75 per
cent to 3.75 per cent as part of a package of measures to stimulate the
economy this week, but the market responded by falling further.
During the week, the Nikkei hits its lowest level since early 1987.
Marketeers had treated the Bank's move with scepticism, and technical
factors had also helped the fall. However, many analysts are now confident
that the market should bottom out by June. Price/earnings ratios are now
much lower than they were at the height at the height of the boom.

The latest house price index from the Nationwide building society gives
little cheer for the depressed property market. It showed a marginal fall of
0.2 per cent in house prices during March, and a fall of 4.9 per cent since
March 1991.
Nationwide does, however, see some signs of hope. It reports that house
prices have flattened after recent monthly falls. It also says that there
were strong signs of increased activity in the market until the general
election was announced. People now have their homebuying plans on hold until
after April 9.

FT  04 APR 92 / Markets: Dull results cloud sunny economic forecasts - Wall
Street
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FIRST quarter is over, the US economy is showing signs of life, but Wall
Street is getting the jitters.
Yet just two to three weeks ago, the economic picture was looking rosier.
Evidence of an economic recovery could be found in improved February
employment, personal income, industrial production and home sales data. This
was backed by anecdotal evidence that corporate confidence was improving and
business activity picking up.
Although the brightening outlook failed to provide stocks with much of a
lift, it at least kept investors happy as the market remained buoyant and
share prices stayed close to record levels.
This week, however, doubts about the strength and depth of the recovery in
the economy and corporate earnings resurfaced, as did concern that an
overvalued stock market may be heading for a correction.
Investors also had one other potentially disruptive influence to consider
this week - the declines in Japanese stock prices. Several years ago a week
of dramatic losses in Tokyo might have created turmoil in New York, such was
the extent of Japanese investment in dollar assets.
The steady repatriation of Japanese funds in the last two years has reduced
the US market's vulnerability to nasty shocks in Tokyo. That said, Japanese
investors still have billions of dollars invested in US stocks and bonds,
and Wall Street knows only too well that a financial crisis in Tokyo could
yet trigger large withdrawals of Japanese money.
Even if US investors were able to put aside their dark thoughts about Japan,
there was enough at home for them to worry about this week. The first
quarter reporting season approaches, and the market's complacency of the
past month received a knock when several large companies warned that first
quarter earnings would not be as good as hoped.
Bristol-Myers Squibb led the way on Tuesday with a statement that first
quarter sales were not as strong as had been forecast, although the drug
group did say it still expected profits for the three months to show a
modest improvement on a year ago.
W R Grace followed suit the next day, the chemicals and energy combine
warning that first quarter earning would be lower than the 36 cents a share
it posted last year. The announcement shaved eight per cent off the stock
price.
Polaroid shares also took a hit when the company said its opening quarter
profits would be below last year's, while Immunex stock plunged 25 per cent
after the drug company stunned analysts who had forecast a profitable
quarter by alerting them that a loss would be posted for the period.
Discount warehouse retailer Price Co surprised the market with
January-to-March earnings that came in well below analysts' estimates,
prompting a wave of selling that wiped more than 20 per cent off the
company's market value.
Although it is too early to tell if a pattern is developing, the profit
warnings and earnings disappointments suggested optimism about the first
quarter may have been overdone. The message from the share price declines in
Bristol-Myers, W R Grace, Polaroid et al was that any companies which
produce first-quarter shocks will be treated harshly by investors.
The market also had to contend with fresh revelations of trouble at giant
Canadian property developer Olympia &amp; York. As the biggest owner of property
in Manhattan, and a once favoured client of US banks, the news that O &amp; Y
lacks the cash flow to make the repayments on its debts sent a shiver
through the New York banking sector. Not surprisingly, the likes of
Chemical, Bankers Trust and Citicorp were left with losses at the end of the
week.
Even the high-flying broking stocks had a tough time. The week opened
brightly with the news that the flood of stock and bond issues during the
opening three months of the year lifted fees at the big securities and
broking houses to record levels in the first quarter. By Thursday, however,
investors were asking how long the party could last. Amid talk that
investors' appetite for new stock is waning and that corporate equity and
bond issuance has peaked, shares in Merrill Lynch, PaineWebber, Morgan
Stanley, Bear Stearns and other listed brokers nose dived.

</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BANK-hopping
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
or, more precisely, the desire to bank-hop - afflicts most people from time
to time. Usually, it takes the form of a despondent friend or acquaintance
enquiring if you are happy with your bank since they want to leave theirs.
Many think the interest rates on their overdrafts are higher than at other
banks, or that the level of service is below standard, but a few depositors
also are worried about the strength of their bank's balance sheet and what
it could mean for them.
Collectively, the Big Four banks - Midland, National Westminster, Barclays
and Lloyds - had loan losses of Pounds 5.6bn last year, and none has been
out of the headlines recently.
The news this week that Heron International, the property and finance group
headed by Gerald Ronson, wants to reschedule Pounds 1.3bn of debt caused the
shares of its most exposed UK lender, Barclays, to fall.
Barclays also has the biggest lending exposure of the large banks to Tiny
Rowland's troubled Lonrho group and is also exposed to Olympia &amp; York, the
world's largest property group, which is developing the Canary Wharf project
in London's Docklands but has debts of Dollars 20bn.
National Westminster's chief executive, Tom Frost, also resigned this week
after the Department of Trade and Industry re-opened the affair of the
botched Blue Arrow rights issue. NatWest has been going through dismal
times, with pre-tax profits in 1991 down by 78 per cent to Pounds 110m due
to some of the biggest losses ever incurred by a UK bank on domestic
lending.
Lloyds, at least, has been doing relatively well compared with its peers,
and actually increased its 1991 pre-tax profit over the previous year -
despite a record loss on UK loans of Pounds 885m. But its position was
strong enough for it to propose merger talks with the ailing Midland Bank.
Indeed, the Midland has been struggling harder and longer than the others
following its disastrous acquisition of the US bank, Crocker, early in the
1980s.
It was exposed badly to Third World debt and in 1990 became the first UK
bank since the 1930s to cut its dividend. But a fairy godmother came to the
rescue when the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation made a takeover
proposition almost a fortnight ago. The details have yet to be published but
it seems likely that a deal will be worked out.
Depositors at the Midland may feel alarmed that their bank is likely to be
taken over by an institution from so far away, even though the Hongkong and
Shanghai is domiciled in the UK. But the Bank of England is expected to give
regulatory approval to the deal only if it is satisfied that UK depositors
will be protected.
How should customers regard such developments? There was a time when banks
seemed to be as safe as houses; but just as that cliche has lost its
meaning, so customers should be aware that these august institutions are
subject to pressures which could be passed on to depositors.
Some Midland customers may be sceptical of the Bank of England's capacity to
shield them from potential disasters, mindful of the losses caused to
depositors when the Bank of Credit and Commerce International went under
last year. But it is almost inconceivable that a government of any party
could allow a Big Four bank to go the same way.
The same is not true of smaller institutions - indeed, there have been
several failures of small regional UK banks in the past few years. But the
real danger for clearing bank customers lies more with the increased costs
of borrowing and less-generous rates of interest than the danger of
collapse.
Already, the recession has caused large institutions such as the Halifax
building society to introduce charges for across-the-counter withdrawals by
customers with low balances in savings accounts.
Home-buyers also are finding that they are getting credit on terms far less
generous - some would say, less foolhardy - than a few years ago. And it was
the complaints by owners of small businesses over their borrowing rates that
started a furore over banks' lending practices a few months ago.
So, most people will find that when the banks come under pressure, so do
they. Under such circumstances, it is as well to realise when you are
getting a particularly bad deal. For example, many home-owners who went to
the centralised mortgage lenders (which were exposed particularly badly to
the housing slump, since they do not take savings) are now finding they are
paying rates well above the present standard of 10.95 per cent.
And if you have a lot of money in one institution, you might consider taking
the advice given by Kevin Goldstein-Jackson in his Diary of a Private
Investor last week.
He spreads money between a number of building societies so as to make the
best use of the Investor Protection Scheme, which covers the first 90 per
cent of the amount deposited up to a maximum of Pounds 20,000. The Deposit
Protection Scheme for bank deposits is lower, covering only 75 per cent up
to a maximum of Pounds 15,000.
Hopping from bank to bank is probably not necessary. But some nimble
footwork to keep a presence in several banks at once might repay the effort.

FT  04 APR 92 / Markets: A tale of two fortunes . . . - The Bottom Line
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE OVERSEAS traders sector used to conjure up images of Somerset Maugham's
rubber planters drinking gin slings at the club.
The sector was abolished in 1990, but two of its former denizens - Harrisons
&amp; Crosfield and Inchcape - reported results this week. Their fortunes have
diverged in the 1990s; Inchcape's star rising, while recession has hit H &amp;
C.
Inchcape announced record 1991 profits on Monday of Pounds 185.2m pre-tax
(Pounds 174m). H &amp; C's profits fell by a third to Pounds 71.2m, and had to
dip into reserves to hold its dividend.
This is a reversal of the City's view of the two companies in the late
1980s. Inchcape was regarded as an uninspiring overseas trader, but H &amp; C
had persuaded the City it was transforming itself from a sleepy plantation
company to a go-ahead conglomerate.
H &amp; C's history over the last 10 years has been one of managing change. It
lost control of its Malaysian plantations when the government decided they
should be in local hands. Between 1982 and 1989 H &amp; C received nearly Pounds
300m in cash from the sale.
It had substantial funds to reinvest, and it described its policy as 'highly
selective diversity'. It chose chemicals, where it already had interests;
timber and building supplies based on its expertise in its Borneo timber
business; and animal feeds, agriculture providing a link with plantations.
There have been a number of acquisitions: the biggest was the Pounds 116m
bid for Pauls, the animal feeds group, in 1985; Southern-Evans, the timber
company was acquired for Pounds 83.3m in 1988; and Crossley, the builders
merchants, for Pounds 113m in May 1990. On Wednesday it said it would buy
the BOCM-Silcock animal feeds company for Pounds 67m. Yet it was only
plantations which increased profits.
Often, the group has appeared to promise much, but failed to deliver.
Criticisms centre on the timing of acquisitions, with some of the chemicals
and building supplies businesses bought at the top of the cycle. Animal
feeds is a much more defensive business and analysts question whether now is
the time to be buying - although the price of BOCM seems to enhance H &amp; C's
earnings straight away.
Inchcape also diversified, although most of its acquisitions have been
smaller. It has built an inspection and testing division, for instance.
However, it is Inchcape's long-established activities that have provided
recent growth. Inchcape's relationship with Toyota, the Japanese car maker,
dates back 25 years in the UK. Its motors business - which made nearly 60
per cent of operating profits in 1991 - accelerated in the late 1980s and
has held up in the recession. It is now set to jump following the Pounds
383m takeover of Tozer Kemsley &amp; Millbourn.
Marketing and distribution is another of Inchcape's base businesses, and
that division has increased operating profits from Pounds 22.3m in 1986 to
Pounds 57.2m in 1991. Inchcape distributes Barbie dolls in Japan, Coca-Cola
in Chile and Kelloggs cornflakes in Bahrain.
Inchcape's success - but also its weakness - is in handling other people's
brands. Manufacturers get uneasy when others make money from their goods -
for instance, Inchcape's stake in the Rolex watch business in Singapore has
been cut.
Although Inchcape has generally been successful in finding new concessions
to replace those it loses, it does lower the quality of earnings.
The big question is over the motors side, especially after moves by Volvo,
Nissan and Volkswagen to take control of the UK distribution of their cars.
In 1990 Toyota paid Inchcape Pounds 60m for a stake in Toyota (GB), the UK
distribution company, which will rise to 51 per cent in 1998. Inchcape will
lose control of one of its best businesses, although it will have 49 per
cent of what will be a larger company.
Inchcape also acts for Toyota in Belgium and Greece, and it is conceivable
that Toyota might want to take control of all its EC distribution.
Inchcape's share price appears to ignore such concerns. Meanwhile, the cloud
over H &amp; C hides the likelihood of a cyclical recovery in profits. Its
shares rest only on its 9.8 per cent yield. It may be time for another
reversal of the two companies' fortunes.

FT  04 APR 92 / The Long View: First victims of Maastricht

<TEXT>
CAN EUROPE'S monetary structures stand the strain? Two of the European
Community's biggest four countries face national elections in the next few
days. A third, having just completed local elections in which the ruling
party has performed poorly, has ousted its prime minister.
These events come against the background of poor economic performance, with
growth of not much more than 1 per cent in the EC during 1991, and prospects
little if any better for 1992. The average unemployment rate is around 10
per cent outside Germany. Bond markets throughout Europe have become
apprehensive.
In Britain we are so obsessed with our own election campaign that it can be
an effort to step back for a moment and look at the broader picture. Indeed,
John Major's government has to bear responsibility for its own home-grown
recession which relates to the domestic miscalculations from 1985 onwards.
But the UK's recovery is threatened by a broader world slowdown which is
affecting Japan and Germany, locomotives that until recently were still
driving the global economy forward.
In the US, George Bush is facing re-election problems largely because of
economic disappointments. At least Americans have the freedom to use a full
range of economic policy options to stimulate a recovery. So have the
Japanese, who this week unveiled an economic package including lower
interest rates. In the EC this freedom no longer exists, monetary policy has
been surrendered to the Bundesbank.
Only some four months after the intoxicating rhetoric and historical
grandeur of Maastricht many of Europe's politicians are facing harsher local
realities. In Italy, which votes this weekend, the damage may be no more
than the emergence of some regional factions like the Lombardy League. But
John Major seems likely to lose office, not because of any great popular
enthusiasm about Labour but because too many voters face economic hardship.
Yet it is the problems in France that are probably most central to the
growing European economic crisis of confidence. This was the country that in
the early 1980s knuckled down to the challenge of curing its historical
weaknesses of inflation and political instability. It has eased its
inflation down to, and below, German levels.
Now that British borrowing levels are soaring France appears to be the only
EC member state that can expect comfortably to comply with the famous
Maastricht conditions for monetary union, including a budget deficit of no
more than 3 per cent of GDP and total outstanding public sector debt of less
than 60 per cent of GDP.
In the capital markets France has been rewarded with a steadily reducing
premium in the rate it has to pay on its government bonds compared with the
Germans. As for short-term interest rates, on three-month money the rate on
French francs is only  1/4 of a percentage point higher than on the D-Mark.
The pound sterling pays 1 1/2 per cent more, the lira 2 1/4 per cent and the
peseta 2 1/2 per cent.
For these very real achievements the French Socialists might have expected
some electoral recognition, but they have not received it. Instead Jean Le
Pen is on the warpath, feeding off unemployment and regional recession, and
the Socialists face disaster in next year's national elections. This week
Edith Cresson, the former premier, paid the price, admittedly for more than
just economic misfortunes. Her successor Pierre Beregovoy is well-regarded
by the financial markets. His prospects in the country may be another
matter.
European interest rates now stick out a mile from the global list. This week
Japanese yen money rates fell to under 5 per cent, much in line with dollar
rates, and half the level of even the keenest EC rates. The UK and France
are bravely forecasting that economic growth will accelerate later this year
but it seems fanciful to suppose that a recovery of any strength can be
achieved while interest rates are so high. But interest rates are determined
by what is going on in Germany, and there seems no early prospect of any
relief from Germany's lethal combination of anti-inflationary zeal at the
Bundesbank, which holds short rates up, and fiscal imprudence by the
government which is maintaining bond yields high throughout the EC.
There is, of course, a conspiracy of silence about this in the British
election campaign. All the parties are committed to maintaining sterling in
the ERM at a central parity of DM2.95. This united stand has worked.
Speculators have not dared to attack sterling on any scale during the
campaign. But one-year money is at 11 1/4 per cent, showing that rates are
regarded as more likely to rise than fall in the months ahead.
The Tories must carry the blame for the past, but if Labour forms the next
government it will quickly acquire responsibility for any failure of the
economy to recover. If parliament is hung that responsibility might be
assessed against Labour in hard votes at a second election quite soon. What
could be more natural than to form a common cause with the otherwise doomed
fellow-socialists of France and hatch plans to confront the Germans?
For the time being Labour's leaders are maintaining their manifesto line. If
interest rates have to go up after the election in order to maintain parity,
they say, then so be it. They will do whatever is necessary. Before very
long, however, the next British government may find itself facing a
financial crisis. Bank shares are tumbling as concern grows about a new wave
of bad debts, and there can be no adequate solution that does not include a
sharp fall in interest rates.
Europe's leaders have invested a formidable amount of political capital in
EMU, nobody more than Beregovoy. But if they are ever to reach 1997 they
must, as a first step, survive 1992.

FT  04 APR 92 / Keynes here, how can I help you?: The election is over - a
new prime minister has formed a coalition. But who will advise him how to
pull Britain's economy out of the mire? He dials a long-forgotten number . .
Lord Skidelsky, biographer of Keynes, overhears the conversation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Lord SKIDELSKY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRIME MINISTER: Can you hear me?
John Maynard Keynes: I can hear you perfectly; the difficulty may lie in you
hearing me.
PM: No doubt your mind has been on other things since you . . . er . . .
left us.
JMK: We have an excellent newspaper service up here. The Financial Times is
delivered every day.
PM: Well, then, what am I to do?
JMK: I thought you would ask me that. I do not envy you your task. You would
not be in your present pickle had your predecessors used the telephone more
frequently.
PM: I must tell you that many people down here blame you for what you call
'our pickle'. You taught us that governments could always spend their way
out of depressions. We tried to do that. As a result we got high
unemployment and rising prices at the same time.
JMK: I left you with an organised method for thinking about particular
problems, not a machine for blind - or political - manipulation]
PM: It's always the politicians who get blamed . . .
JMK: The economists have been just as bad. They thought you could do
everything by demand, and completely neglected supply.
PM: But you told them that]
JMK: Nonsense. You have obviously never read my General Theory. I taught
that when there is heavy unemployment, an increase in spending can raise
output and employment. But how the increase is divided between higher output
and higher prices depends on supply conditions - the state of the labour
market and the amount of capacity. I made certain assumptions about these
things, which were perfectly valid in the 1930s. Only a lunatic, or someone
whose common sense had been destroyed by econometrics, could suppose that
these conditions would stay the same. If, for example, wage increases absorb
the profit potential of expansion, you will simply get a rise in prices.
PM: But you were well known to be indifferent to inflation.
JMK: Wrong. I taught that capitalism requires stable prices, and that the
future will not be like the past. Had you remembered these two things you
would have been able to apply my theory properly.
PM: I am not blaming you. But we must start from where we are now.
JMK: Where you are now is that unemployment is approaching 3m and prices are
still rising by 4 per cent a year. You have lost control over your interest
rates and your exchange rate, the world economy is on its back, and your
budget deficit is set to have inflation roaring away again.
PM: Thank you . . .
JMK: You made the fatal mistake of joining the European Exchange Rate
mechanism before you had got your costs under control; exactly the mistake
Churchill made when he put Britain back on the gold standard in 1925 - a
decision I opposed. Fixing your exchange rate may be convenient; it should
never be used to force wage adjustment. Any attempt to do so will always
cause a fixed exchange rate system to break down.
PM: Does that means that we will have to devalue?
JMK: Some general realignment is probably inevitable. I have always believed
that you have got to do the best you can in the situation in which you find
yourself. So I will take the existing external constraint as given - just as
I accepted the fact of the gold standard. You have made one good decision.
PM: What is that?
JMK: You have formed a National Government. That was only sensible in the
conditions of a hung parliament. But it is also essential for what has to be
done.
PM: Which is . . .?
JMK: The first thing you must do is to knock out inflation. It is the
continuing rise in wages and prices which makes the expansion of demand such
a risky business. A policy aimed at reversing a fall in prices, such as I
recommended in the 1920s and 1930s, cannot achieve its effect if prices are
rising. So you have got to say frankly to the trade unions: 'There is no
hope of a sustainable recovery in output and employment unless inflation is
brought down to zero and kept there. Either we can intensify unemployment
through a policy of high interest rates. This will eventually slow the rate
of increase in money wages, and thus in the cost of living. This has been
the policy pursued over the last three years. But it is a hateful and
wasteful policy, and brings no guarantee of improved employment. Or we can
try to secure, by agreement, a one-year freeze on wages and salaries,
followed by a year of severe restraint. It should take two years to achieve
stable prices. The choice is yours. Can we agree a National Treaty to
achieve this?'
PM: Suppose this could be done, and the policy works. How would you stop
wage pressure from building up again in year three?
JMK: Believe me, it is much easier to keep inflation at zero than to bring
it down to zero. Except in abnormal conditions, inflationary wage pressure
is always induced by inflationary expectations. Eliminate the inflation, and
you stop the wage-push. I predict that the first country in Europe to get
its inflation rate down to zero will be able to keep it there. But of
course, I would use the technique of the National Treaty to try to secure
all kinds of improvements in the machinery of wage-bargaining. And you
should certainly be prepared to put up taxes if prices showed a tendency to
rise.
PM: Of course, if it could be done . . .
JMK: The beauty of the scheme is that if you could get inflation down to
zero, Britain would be poised to regain the financial leadership of Europe.
Sterling would replace, or at least join, the Deutschmark as the anchor
currency of Europe. You would regain control over your own interest rates.
The balance of forces in Europe would be entirely different. Here is a
robust national response both to those who run to the Bundesbank to protect
them against the alleged rapacity of the British worker, and to those who
whine about German monetary imperialism. As you see, all my old patriotism
stirs when I contemplate the decadence of the British capitalist class.
PM: What can I offer the unions in return?
JMK: First, a national commitment to eliminate inflation, backed by the
authority of a National Government, would have an extremely favourable
effect on business expectations. In the breathing space afforded by the wage
freeze certain measures can be taken to expand demand, in addition to those
already in the pipeline. There is some scope for an old-fashioned public
works programme which would employ unskilled labour at a wage only
moderately in excess of the current dole. My rough calculation is that
500,000 could be taken off the unemployment register fairly quickly, at very
moderate cost, and without any risk of inflation. Incidentally, you should
persuade your Labour colleagues to abandon the silly idea of a minimum wage,
which is nothing but a tax on employment. In the long run you will have to
put right the catastrophic failure in your system of education and training,
unless 10 per cent of the working population are to be permanently forced to
scrounge for a living, and the rest confined to a level of performance well
below their capacity.
PM: But is there not a limit to how much a country can do for itself? As you
said, the world economy is flat on its back. We need an international
recovery to get our exports going again.
JMK: There I agree with you. Since the war the capitalistic system has been
kept going by heavy armaments expenditure and the endless stimulation of
wants by advertising and easy credit. The first factor is now coming to an
end, and the second is highly fickle. Indeed, consumption demand has become
almost as psychological as investment demand. Not only does this make the
system even more unstable than it was in my day, but it has been obvious for
two decades now that these artificial devices have been unable to maintain
anything like full employment in the developed countries, except in moments
of excitement. However, you now have a heaven-sent opportunity to revive the
animal spirits of entrepreneurs.
PM: What do you mean?
JMK: Think back to the 19th century. A major source of demand for capital
goods came through the opening up of new lands, with their requirements for
transport systems, port and harbour facilities, agricultural machinery,
energy, and so on. By the end of the 19th century this frontier had closed,
and the Great Depression was in large measure a consequence of this closure.
That is to say, the stock of capital goods had increased relatively to the
demand for them, so that their marginal efficiency fell. Now the frontier
has re-opened.
PM: I do not follow you.
JMK: I am referring to the collapse of Communism. The larger part of the
capital stock of the former Soviet Union was built up to satisfy the demands
of the military, regardless of cost and efficiency. It cannot be converted
to peacetime uses, whether for export or private domestic consumption. No
increase in agricultural production is possible if they go on designing
tractors like tanks. The capital stock is mostly obsolete.
Technically speaking, the real demand for capital for the purpose of
producing for private consumption has risen enormously relative to its
supply. But for the foreseeable future much of the new capital equipment
will have to be imported from the West, and Russia cannot pay, since it has
nothing to export in return. Russia will not be able to borrow from bankers
or private investors for some time to come. The risk is too great. The
situation offers an unparalleled opportunity to jolt the Western world out
of depression by re-equipping the former Soviet Union, entrenching the new
world order by strengthening free institutions there, and in the long run
producing a permanent expansion in world trade. But you must start by
artificial assistance on a substantial scale, and trust the business will
run itself afterwards.
PM: What is to be done?
JMK: The experts are talking about IMF quotas, stabilisation loans, balance
of payments support, humanitarian aid, and so forth. Something much more
imaginative is needed. I propose that a consortium of the G7 countries grant
the former Soviet Union and its satellites a credit of about Dollars 100bn
per year for two years, the money to be expended on purchases of capital
goods from the donors, in agreed proportions, to promote agricultural
production, and the renovation of their transport system and factories, with
the purpose of relieving immediate hardship, and encouraging export later.
The great attraction of this scheme is that it would set up an external
demand on the capital goods industries of the West which would allow a
simultaneous expansion of exports, the counterpart of which would be the
import surpluses of the former Soviet system. It is the same combination of
self-interest and altruism which inspired the Marshall Plan. Had the West
lifted its sights and done this in 1922, as I proposed, the whole of the
Bolshevik nonsense could have been avoided. Instead all they could talk
about was Tsarist debts. You must not fail a second time.
PM: You have given me considerable food for thought.
JMK: I wanted to tell you about my vision of the good life. But that will
have to wait. I have an appointment with my beloved Paracelsus. After that I
leave for a galaxy many billions of light years away. We have had to impose
direct rule on a planet there: they have been much more incompetent than you
are. So you see, I am as busy as ever. But to be alive up here is very
heaven]

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The good news is confirmation that Heron International's problems stem
mostly from the foolhardy adventures of its Pima Savings subsidiary in the
US rather than anything in the UK. The bad news is that Heron and its
bankers must be taking a gloomy view of Pima's real estate investments. No
one would want to reschedule Swiss Franc bonds without good reason, least of
all if there is still enough cash in the kitty to last the next 18 months.
It is taking virtue rather far to attempt it just because asset write-downs
have put the company in technical breach of its banking covenants.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Doubtless Sir Alan Walters thinks Portugal is making a terrible mistake in
joining the ERM, but the escudo is too small to make much difference to the
other members. Certainly, another high interest rate currency should not be
too problematic for sterling which has managed to survive at its peseta
floor for months. What matters most is the floor against the D-Mark and that
is still six pfennigs away.
The British currency's weakness in the second half of this week owes as much
to D-Mark strength in the wake of high German inflation figures and the
anaemic US recovery as to domestic politics. Talk of higher base rates is
premature to say the least. The markets may be looking for a display of
determination immediately after the election, but higher rates would only
become necessary if speculators actually sold sterling through its D-Mark
floor. That would be rash when all three leading parties are committed to
maintaining the DM2.95 central rate.

FT  04 APR 92 / The Lex Column: Waste Management
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The coincidence of the election aside, it seems the market is nervous about
the Pounds 465m flotation of Waste Management International. With offerings
such as GPA, Wellcome, 3i, and the Daily Telegraph yet to come, a flop could
have expensive consequences for the City. That is why Severn Trent Water's
admission this week that its Biffa waste subsidiary is performing below
expectations was unfortunate. Granted, the immature UK waste industry is
scarcely comparable with its US equivalent and in any case has lost its
premium rating. Nor does any UK company have anything near the market
presence of WMI's US parent. But some UK investors are sceptical of the
US-style multiple demanded for WMI shares.
There are deeper questions being asked of the issue, not least why the
parent should sell its fast-growing overseas operations merely to pay off
cheap debt. Promises of fast earnings growth for WMI sit uneasily with the
lack of a profits forecast and a stated intention not to pay dividends at
this stage. The prospectus also revealed over half the group's 1991 turnover
was generated in Italy and Argentina. But perhaps this is academic. The
flotation will probably succeed because the shares are attractive to US
funds. UK investors who doubt WMI's merits can wait to be convinced - the
multiple is unlikely to be much higher a year from now. Just the same,
London's corporate financiers will be glad to put this sale behind them.

FT  04 APR 92 / The Lex Column: Gilts
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Smith's shadow Budget has already won top marks for sleight of hand
by fudging privatisation receipts and introducing leasing for rolling stock
on the North Kent line. So it would be natural for him to be preparing a
list of similar wheezes for use in case he is chancellor in a week's time.
One obvious choice would be to abolish the rule whereby purchases of gilts
by banks and building societies do not count towards funding the PSBR. Such
a change would not reduce the crude PSBR figure, but it could be funded with
fewer sales of gilts.
The Treasury's long-standing objection is that the change would be
inflationary, but no other industrial country shares this worry. Besides, at
slightly under 6 per cent, the annual growth of M4 money supply is at its
lowest point since 1970. If inflationary expectations were heightened, the
effect on gilt yields would surely be offset by lower supply.
Annual purchases of gilts by banks and building societies currently amount
to only about Pounds 1bn. That is small in relation to Mr Smith's expected
PSBR of some Pounds 30bn. But, having burnt their fingers in the property
market, banks might not need much persuading to step up their activity. The
attraction to them is that holdings of government debt require minimal
allocation of capital under Basle rules. The worry for the rest of us is
that bank money diverted to Mr Smith would not be available to finance
private sector recovery. The price could be a credit crunch if he decides to
let himself off the funding hook too easily.

FT  04 APR 92 / The Lex Column: Divided on dividends
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The main interest for investors next week might normally be the final leg of
the current company reporting season. But though the next decisive move in
the FT-SE clearly hinges on the next occupant of 10 Downing Street, the
fundamentals should not be overlooked.
The news so far from companies with a December 1991 year-end has been mixed.
Profits have perhaps been a touch worse than expected, owing mainly to harsh
cost cutting and high provisioning. But balance sheets have emerged looking
healthier than the predictions. Above all, the market's worst fears on the
dividend front have not been realised. Financials were always the most
vulnerable sector, and even there the shock of a completely passed final
from Royal Insurance was offset by a mere two-thirds cut from Midland.
That said, the determination of managements to maintain payouts leaves the
market badly exposed to a yet further prolonged recession. Even on a sharp
bounce in 1992 earnings, very few capital goods stocks will show dividend
cover of more than two times.
For bulls, the high yields on many industrials have turned shares into
convertibles on an economic recovery. The danger is in believing there is no
downside. Equally, the other great hope - that low inflation would justify
higher multiples - does not seem borne out by the inclusion of Guinness and
Cable &amp; Wireless among the 10 worst-performing FT-SE stocks since Mr
Lamont's Budget. Nor will it be while high real interest rates make it hard
to value real growth in earnings.

FT  04 APR 92 / Italy sees signs of change ahead of saint's day poll: Robert
Graham looks at the choices before voters
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A RAIN of red sand on Rome, yellow snow in Sardinia. For a nation
mistrustful of psephology but long accustomed to reading auguries, the
portents of change are in the air as Italians prepare to go to the polls in
tomorrow's general election.
Tomorrow is the saint's day of San Vincenzo Ferreri, and 23 of the 11,927
candidates celebrate their birthdays. But the only statistical certainty
about the outcome is that, based on the 1987 results, those called Vincenzo,
after the saint, stand 3.6 times less chance of being elected than the
Guiseppes.
Family names count too. Mr Luciano Benetton, one of the four founders of
Italy's best-known family clothing company, is hoping his name will ensure
election as candidate for the small Republican party.
The elections are also a big test for the sentimental appeal of Italy's most
infamous politician, Benito Mussolini, and the country's greatest actress,
Sophia Loren. Ms Alessandra Mussolini, the 28-year-old starlet niece of Ms
Loren and grand-daughter of Il Duce, is standing in Naples for the
neo-fascist party MSI.
The appearence of the voluptuous Ms Mussolini has been ignored by the
Italian press, though attention from the international media has created the
impression she alone can solve Italy's problems of rising crime,
institutional atrophy and a yawning public sector deficit.
The elections are the first real challenge to the post-war hegemony of the
Christian Democrats and much is at stake. A sign of Christian Democrat
efforts to pull out all the stops was the behaviour of Mr Enzo Scotti, the
interior minister. In Naples, he was found distributing stencils to
illiterates so that they can shade in their preferred candidates' names,
thereby getting round a new rule obliging voters to spell these out.
In the early stages of the campaign Mr Scotti earned near universal ridicule
for claiming a plot was afoot to destabilise the country following the Mafia
killing of Mr Salvartore Lima, the Christian Democrat boss of Sicily. Even
the ever cautious Mr Giulio Andreotti, the prime minister, dismissed the
suggestion as a 'worthless bit of currency'.
A mixture of Italians' new-found wealth and the disappearence of the
Communist party has taken the campaign off the streets. The mass meetings
have gone. Television now dominates. This has lead to the banning, for the
duration of the campaign, of at least one 'unhelpful' programme on state-run
but Christian Democrat-controlled RAI TV.
To convince voters that Italy can win not only Hollywood Oscars but also its
place in Europe, RAI TV wheeled on Henry Kissinger and Mikhail Gorbachev to
shower praise on the achievements of an ossified conservative
administration.
The beggar who stands on one of Rome's main streets, displaying a sign
'thinking is not begging', had a smart answer yesterday when asked for whom
he would vote.
'Beggars are not choosers,' he said with aplomb. But tomorrow 47m voters
will choose.

FT  04 APR 92 / Criticism between Polly Peck administrators
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BARCHARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TWO administrators of Polly Peck International have publicly distanced
themselves from the third, in the latest twist in the story of Mr Asil
Nadir's electronics, fruit and leisure company which collapsed in 1990 with
debts of Pounds 1.35bn.
But criticism of Mr Christopher Morris of Touche Ross by his fellow
insolvency practitioners, Mr Richard Stone of Coopers &amp; Ly-brand Deloitte
and Mr Michael Jordan of Cork Gully appears to have been intended to placate
Turkish Cypriot sensitivities in the hope of eventually unlocking Polly Peck
records and funds in Cyprus.
At a press conference on Thursday in northern Cyprus, Turkish Cypriot
journalists were handed a press release prepared by leading counsel in which
Mr Stone and Mr Jordan said a recent unsuccessful action by Mr Morris in the
High Court in London against the Turkish Cypriot central bank was his sole
responsibility, and statements and allegations by Mr Morris should not be
attributed to them.
They said they particularly regretted the fact that Mr Morris, in his
affidavit to the High Court, had described the Turkish army's intervention
in Cyprus in 1974, which led to the division of the island, as an invasion.
The three administrators and the committee of Polly Peck creditors approved
the contents of the statement earlier this week.
In London, Mr Morris denied he was offended by the remarks, saying: 'There
is no rift between the administrators. Everybody agrees that this is the
right way forward.'
The Turkish Cypriots are still furious at court action by Mr Morris which
secured a freezing order against the central bank on Pounds 38.9m in
November, overturned in the appeal court in London. The Turkish Cypriots are
poised to launch a counter-suit for damages.
Along with their comments on Mr Morris, the two administrators said they had
regained control of two Polly Peck hotels in northern Cyprus, Jasmine Court
and Palm Beach, and had appointed Execumaster Hotels, an international hotel
management group, to run them.
There were scuffles when the senior staff of the two hotels were asked to
leave.

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE NIKKEI average gained for the first time since Monday, rising on late
index-related buying after falling through 18,000 earlier in the day, writes
Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The index closed up 273.68 at the day's high of 18,559.71, but was still 5.5
per cent lower on the week. It tumbled to the day's low of 17,846.55 early
in the afternoon, pushed down by a fall in the futures market, and lower
bond prices.
Volume was unchanged at 350m shares. Dealers said that despite the rise in
the Nikkei, other statistics indicated that sentiment was still bearish.
Declines led advances by 545 to 419 with 112 issues unchanged, and the Topix
index of all first section stocks fell 1.23 to 1,320.65. The second and
over-the-counter markets also declined. In London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index
fell 2.75 to 1,054.7.
'I haven't seen sentiment as bad as this,' said Mr Brian Tobin at SG Warburg
Securities. Nippon Telegraph and Telephone, the benchmark for market
sentiment, fell Y5,000 to Y600,000. Mr Tobin added that the falls were
especially severe in the banking sector, where 'investors have given up any
hope of making money'. Industrial Bank of Japan fell Y120 to Y1,660 and Fuji
Bank lost Y120 to Y1,500.
The market found some comfort in the establishment of large-lot investment
trusts which are expected to encourage liquidity into the stock market. Mr
Nobuhiko Matsuno, director-general of the ministry of finance securities
bureau, has asked the big four brokers - Nomura, Daiwa, Nikko and Yamaichi -
and the Japan Securities Dealers Association to step up sales of these
instruments.
Foreigners were seen buying international blue chips. High-technology issues
were sought on reports that the 4M D-RAM market had bottomed out. Toshiba
added Y18 to Y578 and Hitachi gained Y13 to Y774.
Tobishima Corp fell Y71 to Y535 on reports that it would make a net loss of
Y45bn for the year to March 1992.
In Osaka, the OSE average fell 79.23 to 19,542.01 in volume of 24m shares.

IF YOU ask Parisian bankers or stockbrokers whether the outcome of next
year's national elections will affect the French markets, the answer is
almost always the same. Whether the socialists stay in power or not, they
say, it will not make a scrap of difference so long as Mr Pierre Beregovoy
is in charge of the economy.
In his five years as finance minister, Mr Beregovoy, or 'Super Bere' as the
French press calls him, has been as rigid in his grip of the economy - with
his insistence on doing nothing, but nothing, to risk raising inflation - as
even the most rabidly right wing of France's financiers could have wished
him to be.
The news on Thursday that Super Bere was succeeding Mrs Edith Cresson as
prime minister was greeted with great sighs of relief on the financial
markets. Mr Michel Sapin might have moved into his old office at the finance
ministry, but the markets did not doubt for a minute that, when it came to
economic policy, Mr Beregovoy would still be calling the tune.
'Before the announcement that Mr Beregovoy had actually been appointed,
there was always a slight risk that Mrs Cresson might stay on and insist on
reflation, forcing him to resign,' says Mr Christopher Potts, market
strategist at Banque Indosuez in Paris. 'That risk has now gone.'
Given the depth of the markets' regard for Mr Beregovoy, it seems surprising
that their immediate reaction was relatively subdued. The CAC 40 index rose
by a modest 0.72 per cent on Thursday and by 0.04 per cent to 1,942.73
yesterday, for a rise of 1 per cent on the week. Bond prices actually fell
on Thursday after a lacklustre response to the Treasury's 10-year bond
auction.
It was only on the money markets that Super Bere received a really rousing
reception. The franc broke through the critical DM3.39 barrier on Thursday
to end at a nine-month high against the D-Mark at DM3.3877, and strengthened
slightly yesterday.
The reason for this muted response was that, by the time President Francois
Mitterrand had finally made up his mind who was to take over from his
'little fighter', Mr Beregovoy had been seen as the likeliest candidate for
so long that the markets regarded his appointment as a fait accompli.
Furthermore, the rumours of Mrs Cresson's dismissal had been so strong for
so long, that the markets had dismissed her as more or less irrelevant.
When Mrs Cresson, whose socialism is of a much more idealistic stamp than
that of the pragmatic Mr Beregovoy, was first appointed last May, the
markets did react - by diving downwards. Her comment shortly after her
appointment - that she 'didn't give a damn about the stock market'  - did
nothing to restore confidence.
'The market fell by 7 or 8 per cent in the period immediately after her
appointment,' recalls Mr David Harrington, French market analyst at James
Capel in Paris. 'But since last autumn, as soon as people realised that she
was not likely to last long and there would be no change in economic policy,
her effect has been neutral. By contrast, Mr Beregovoy has always been seen
as a positive influence.'
Positive though the new prime minister may be, the French stock market seems
set for a sluggish quarter. The combination of rising unemployment - to just
under 10 per cent in February - and high interest rates is making companies
cautious about investment and is depressing consumer confidence. James Capel
expects a reduction of 7.5 per cent in the corporate earnings of the CAC 40
companies in 1992, compared with a fall of 5 per cent last year.
The underlying trends are much more encouraging. Interest rates are almost
certain to fall if German rates are reduced in the autumn, thereby
alleviating the pressure on industry.
French inflation, now running at 3 per cent, is still lower than any other
major European economy. The official forecast, announced on Tuesday by Mr
Beregovoy in one of his last acts as finance minister, of 2.8 per cent for
1992 and 1993 suggests it will stay low for the foreseeable future. He also
signalled that France was on course for growth of 2 per cent this year and
2.6 per cent next year.
'French companies tend to be conservatively run and should be in good shape
when the pick-up comes,' said Mr Potts of Indosuez. 'Everything suggests
that the long-term outlook for the French market is really very good.'

FT  04 APR 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Germany and Italy steady ahead
of elections
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ELECTIONS AT the weekend sent investors to the sidelines in Frankfurt and
Milan while higher interest rates depressed other continental bourses,
writes Antonia Sharpe.
FRANKFURT failed to continue Thursday's advance as buying interest dried up
ahead of the weekend's state elections.
The results are not expected to have an impact on the stock market next
week, since the opposition SPD party is likely to defend successfully its
seat in Schleswig-Holstein and any damage suffered by the ruling CDU party
in Baden-Wurttemberg should be offset by support from its FDP coalition
partner. Only a serious loss for the CDU would be seen as negative for the
stock market.
The DAX index traded in a narrow seven-point range before closing 2.03 lower
at 1,719.63, up 0.5 per cent on the week, while the FAZ index, calculated at
mid-session, rose 1.29 to 702.24, for a rise of 0.9 per cent on the week.
Turnover fell from DM6.2bn to DM4.5bn.
Blue chips were mixed, as Deutsche Bank fell DM3 to DM712 after its
disappointing 1991 results on Thursday.
But Veba bucked the easier trend, rising DM1.30 to DM389.20 in good volume
of 761,440 shares. The stock has added 3 per cent since March 25, when it
announced a DM1 rise in its 1992 dividend to DM12. Dealers said the
diversified electricity utility was also regarded as a potential takeover
target, since it had no large shareholders to defend its independence.
MILAN closed mixed on position-squaring ahead of this weekend's general
election, which could turn out to be a turning point in Italian politics.
The Comit index rose 0.13 to 508.90, up 2.2 per cent on the week, in
turnover estimated at near to Friday's L101.6bn.
Generali lent some support to the market, rising L100 to L29,400 but other
leading blue chips were lower, with Fiat falling L45 to L4,185. San Paolo,
which was listed on Thursday, fell L25 to L12,215.
STOCKHOLM fell on worries about higher interest rates. The Affarsvarlden
General Index dropped 12.90 to 980.5, down 2.6 per cent on the week, in
steady turnover of SKr409m.
Short-term interest rates points since Thursday, on concerns about a rise in
Swedish capital outflows and higher interest rates in Finland.
HELSINKI had a turbulent day on speculation over a further devaluation in
the markka. The HEX index ended 1.6 per cent higher at 801.4.
ZURICH concentrated on Roche after the pharmaceutical company announced an
unexpectedly strong 56 per cent rise in 1991 group profits to SFr1.48bn.
Roche certificates added SFr40 to SFr3,120 but closed below the day's high
on profit-taking. Roche bearers added SFr50 to SFr4,350.
The SMI index eased 8.9 to 1,829.1, depressed by firmer interest rates and a
weaker Swiss franc, but was little changed on the week.
AMSTERDAM closed mixed as a weaker dollar and a drop on the London stock
exchange weighed on international stocks. The CBS Tendency Index fell 0.5 to
124.7 but was steady on the week.
Heineken closed Fl 1.90 higher at Fl 191.20, off an early high of Fl 193.50.
The brewer said yesterday that it planned to export beer to Germany from
1993. But some analysts were worried that Heineken's problems in Spain would
bring additional costs which were not yet provided for.
MADRID was unable to shake off this week's gloom, as the general index fell
2.12 to 250.55, down 2.4 per cent on the week.
OSLO was dragged down by shipping stocks. The all-share index dropped 4.79,
or 1.1 per cent, to 415.78 in moderate turnover of NKr245.94m. Bergesen was
one of the day's biggest losers, falling below NKr100 for the first time
since early 1991. Its A shares fell NKr3 to NKr97.50 while the B shares shed
NKr5.50 to NKr97.00.
BRUSSELS continued to focus on retailers, which accounted for more than one
third of the day's turnover of BFr580m. The Bel-20 index closed down 4.47 to
1,188.55, little changed on the week. Colruyt closed up BFr10 at BFr4,755,
GIB added BFr4 to BFr1,376 and Delhaize closed down BFr80 at BFr9,330.

FT  04 APR 92 / London Stock Exchange: Share prices weaken as election nears
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CLOSE of a two-week stock exchange account, which coincided with the
tax-year end, left London's equity market looking worn out as the election
campaign moved into its final week.
The FT-SE 100-share index dropped a further 22.7 to 2,382.7, its fourth
consecutive retreat and its lowest level this year. Yesterday's slide left
the index some 65.2 points down on the week, and almost 74 points lower over
the account, during which the market has adjusted to the increasing
likelihood of a Labour government.
There was considerable unease towards the close as sterling came under
pressure against the D-mark, after widespread stories of selling by the
Saudis. But equity dealers took heart from the fact that there was very
little pressure on gilts; the long-dated ended unchanged having been up  1/4
earlier in the session.
Equities opened with minor falls across the board, as marketmakers chopped
their prices to head off end-account selling. They were also weary of fund
managers trying to offload stock in front of the election.
The Footsie began the day some 7.5 points lower and quickly lost ground
during the early part of the session as the Footsie future dipped away.
Dealers said there was 'plenty of stock around during the morning,' with
much of it being offered at a discount to ruling market prices. These offers
had a decisive effect from midday onwards when the Footsie came under some
pressure. The day's low of 2,379.5, or a loss of almost 26 points, was
recorded soon after the opening of Wall Street which, down 5 points during
the first 30 minutes, was showing a 15 points-plus decline after two hours.
Turnover was disappointing in the final trading session of the tax year.
Customer business, which had been down on the first two days of this week,
expanded rapidly in the middle of the week, after a series of big placings
and a sharp expansion in the number of programme trades. Traders said one of
the features of recent trading in equities has been the increase in the
number of programme trades as well as the huge upturn in the level of
business in derivatives. County NatWest calculated that Footsie futures
activity ballooned by 60 per cent last week, with FTSE options volumes up
some 40 per cent.
Turnover, yesterday, reached 532.7m shares, well down on Thursday's 607.2m
and the 702m traded on Wednesday - the highest so far this year.
Equity retail business rose sharply towards the end of the week as fund
managers made final portfolio alterations ahead of the general election.

FT  04 APR 92 / London Stock Exchange: BP under renewed pressure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN, JOEL KIBAZO, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and COLIN MILLHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STORM clouds continued to gather over BP as one securities house came in
with the first shot in a hefty reassessment of the oil group's prospects. It
was also affected by a feeling that enthusiasm from the US might be on the
wane.
Mr Fergus Macleod at County NatWest, sending out a preliminary note to
clients headed: 'The suffering continues', argued that any improvement in
refining margins in the US would be more than offset by falls in Europe and
the Far East. He intends to issue an extremely bearish set of forecasts next
week.
The stock has suffered further on talk that the highly-rated oil analyst
from US brokerage PaineWebber had turned negative on BP. It appears that the
house did reduce its profit forecast but still rates BP as a buy.
US demand, although down on previous days, returned in after-hours trading
last night. The shares were down 6 at one stage, yesterday, before closing 3
1/2 off at 242 1/2 p with 9.7m traded. Investors were also said to be
switching into British Gas, which fell with the market, ending 2 lower at
243p on turnover of 10.9m shares.
Redland surges
Building materials group Redland continued to bask in the positive comments
from its results on Thursday and successful bid for Steetley. Redland's
shares surged 14 to 481p in busy volume of 4.1m. Investor activity was
spurred by the lure of Redland going ex-dividend on Monday, with a final
payment of 22.3p beckoning.
Mr Donald Anderson at Hoare Govett said: 'At 481p I would start to be a
little cautious as a buyer, although the shares still promise to be strong
performers over the next two to three years.'
Banks were weak as their heavy exposure to debt-ridden property groups
continued to drag the sector down. The plight of Heron International was the
focal point and Barclays was again the main casualty with a fall of 12 to
287p. Lloyds, a strong performer for some time, fell 12 to 348p. Midland
lost 3 to 337p despite the support value in its proposed merger with
HongKong &amp; Shanghai.
Power companies were firmer, apart from the Scottish generators and Eastern
Electricity. The latter slipped 14 to 197p as Kleinwort Benson cut its
profit forecast for the year to March to Pounds 135m from Pounds 157m, and
for the current year to Pounds 180m from Pounds 188m. Scottish Power fell 1
1/2 to 79p and Scottish Hydro eased a penny to 81p, but National Power
hardened to 192p and PowerGen added 2 to 203p. Among the regional
electricity distributors, London put on 2 to 233p and Manweb 3 to 263p.
A weaker dollar held back overseas earners. Reuters fell 14 to 1109p, Glaxo
lost 12 to 767p and Wellcome slipped 15 to 1028p.
A big line of stock in Vodafone Group found few buyers and the shares fell 6
1/2 to 308p in a thin market in the telecoms network sector. James Capel is
believed to have been the seller of 1.2m shares which went through at 308p.
South-eastern house builders came under pressure as some in the market felt
they would be penalised by a prospective Labour government. Countryside
Properties slipped 3 to 97p, Laing (John) shed 8 to 170p and Berkeley Group
lost 2 to 231p.
Uncertainties surrounding one US account held by a company recently acquired
by Steel Burrill Jones reflected badly on the shares which fell 10 to 250p
making a slide of 27p in two days.
Political and economic worries weighed on food retailers. J. Sainsbury fell
8 to 375p and Tesco lost 7 1/2 to 242p, despite hopes that Tuesday's
full-year figures will be good. Tesco is expected to show pre-tax profits of
around Pounds 540m, compared with Pounds 417m last year, boosted by an
interest saving from its Pounds 572m rights issue in January 1991.
Animal feed group and food manufacturer, Dalgety, rose 2 to 381p on the
appointment of Mr John West as chairman from September, when Mr Peter Carey
retires.
ICI, which held a meeting with analysts after the market closed on Thursday,
firmed 4 to 1228p.
Troubled chemicals group MTM, which slumped by more than 50 per cent on
Thursday, lost a further 5 1/2 to 25p.
Life assurer London &amp; Manchester fell 14 to 233p as County NatWest advised
clients to sell the stock. The house argued that new business growth was
slowing, the balance sheet was stretched and the shares too expensive.
British Aerospace was resilient, the shares eventually ending only a penny
down at 299p, having touched 306p, on the prospect of raising Pounds 400m
from disposals. BAe was also helped by confirmation from Trafalgar House, a
penny firmer at 111p, that it had bought BAe's stake in the Brooklands
property development. No price was mentioned by either party but analysts
talked of a figure between Pounds 30m and Pounds 40m.
Motor components manufacturer BBA gave up 4 to 110p as part of a block of
2.5m shares continued to overhang the market. The big seller in Siebe was
still offering stock yesterday and that sent the shares falling another 14
to 604p.
Fears that a Labour government would scale down the Trident submarine
programme hurt VSEL and the shares eased another 5 to 265p, with a large
part of the day's business carried out via agency crosses dealt.
BET fell 7 to 114p on reports of a dividend downgrade by BZW. Turnover
reached 5.8m.
A Thursday night presentation at SG Warburg lifted airports group BAA 3 to
553p.
Two sizeable sellers were reported in Ocean Group ahead of next week's
figures and the shares fell 9 to 302p.
Scottish Television jumped 40 to 750p after the company said advertising
revenue was showing real growth for the first time in nearly two years. 1991
profits were down on the previous year but at the top end of forecasts and
the group announced a one-for-one share split.
Pearson bounced back 10 to 755p following recent sharp falls.
Good two-way business in Ladbroke Group left the hotel and leisure concern 3
up at 214p as investors eyed the chunky dividend on offer on Monday.
Turnover was a large 3.2m.
Euro Disney continued its volatile ride, the shares slipping back 7 to
1543p. Adverse press and market comment has undermined the stock in recent
weeks, although sentiment has been strengthened by the political uncertainty
which has affected UK-based stocks. Most observers are waiting for an
analysts' visit to the group on Tuesday to see if the bearish mood is
continued.
Finding support after recent weakness were Rank Organisation, 2 up at 657p
and Thorn EMI, 3 ahead at 738p. Hanson saw good two-way business and closed
a net 3 down on the day at 209 1/2 p with more than 8m shares dealt.
Guinness steadied after Thursday's fall, rising a penny to 540p as Shearson
Lehman Brothers re-emphasised its strong recommendation for the stock. Good
turnover in the traded options market reflected well on Lasmo.
The oil exploration company gained 4 to 190p in the underlying market on
turnover of 9.3m, with the equivalent of a further 5m shares dealt in
options form.
Smith dealt a block of 3m shares earlier this week.

FT  04 APR 92 / World Commodities Prices: Coffee market awaits pact talks -
Week in the Markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD MOONEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE WORLD coffee market was marking time at the end of this week as traders
awaited the start next Monday of fresh negotiations on the future of the
moribund International Coffee Agreement.
Hopes for the revival of the agreement's export quota system, suspended
since July 1989, were given a boost last month when Brazilian growers,
exporters and, finally, the government came out in favour of export controls
as a means of lifting coffee prices out of the present depression. Most
growers in Brazil, the world's biggest coffee producer, had always hankered
after the return of the quota system, but the exporters, understandably, had
been more interested in unfettered trade than in remunerative prices.
Meanwhile the government had shown no inclination to promote consensus on
the issue within the country's coffee sector, much to the frustration of
other producing countries, especially Colombia, the second-biggest producer.
Now that Brazil is off the fence the way seems clear for real progress to be
made towards a new price-stabilisation pact. But traders said yesterday that
the were not expecting a major breakthrough at next week's five-day council
session, in view of the major issues that had to be settled, such as the
level of individual quota shares and the question of 'selectivity' between
different types of coffee.
'What we are searching for is a total consensus of producers and consumers
towards launching a negotiating process for a good agreement, a sustainable
agreement,' said Mr Clodoaldo Hegueney, head of the economics department at
the Brazilian Foreign Ministry, after Brazil's 10-point proposal was
presented at a meeting of the International Coffee Organisation working
group that is studying the prospects for a new international agreement. The
working group is to make recommendations to the ICO at next week's session.
At the London Futures and Options Exchange coffee prices edged higher, with
the July position regaining Dollars 10 of last week's Dollars 18 fall at
Dollars 869 a tonne. But trade was slow, apart from a burst of activity on
Wednesday when turnover totalled 9,647 lots of five tonnes each. Yesterday's
turnover of 1,328 lots was the lowest since mid-February and well below the
recent average.
At the London Metal Exchange base metal prices moved higher early in the
week in response to more hopeful US economic indicators.
The cash copper price, which was also boosted by talk of Chinese, buying
broke through chart-based resistance to reach Pounds 1,300.50 a tonne at one
point. Its gain was trimmed, however, partly in response to the ending after
two days of a rail strike in Zambia. At yesterday's close cash copper was
quoted at Pounds 1,289.50 a tonne, up Pounds 14.50 on the week.
Zinc prices touched fresh 15 1/2 -month peaks early in the week before its
rise was arrested by profit taking and trade selling. But the market
remained underpinned by technical tightness and the cash price closed
yesterday at Pounds 1,273 a tonne, up Dollars 19 on balance.
Concern over the availability of good quality metal for delivery this month
drove the cash tin price higher and by Wednesday's close it had established
a Dollars 30 premium over the three months delivery price, having ended last
week at a Dollars 2.50 discount. At that point Mr David King, the LME chief
executive commented: 'We always watch all markets closely. . . some we're
watching more closely than others. . . Tin falls into that category at
present'. That thinly veiled warning of possible exchange action may have
played a part in the subsequent unwinding of the backwardation, as the cash
premium is known. At yesterday's close cash tin, which had reached Dollars
5,802.50 a tonne on Wednesday, was still Dollars 35 up on the week at
Dollars 5,760 a tonne, but that represented a Dollars 5 discount against the
three months position.
At the London bullion market the platinum price went on a roller-coaster
ride. A statement by Russia's Almazyuvelirexport saying it would retain its
monopoly of exporting the white metal eased fears of an unco-ordinated flood
of metal into western markets and set the price on the upward path that took
it to Dollars 362.50 a troy ounce on Wednesday. But on Thursday dealers
decided that the rise was overdone, and with Japanese investors selling
platinum to cover equity market losses the price plunged Dollars 7.25. At
yesterday afternoon's fixing it was quoted at Dollars 355.75 a tonne, up 50
cents on the day and Dollars 5.25 on the week.

FT  04 APR 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TURNOVER in the London Traded Options market soared to one of its highest
levels this year as dealers hedged positions ahead of next week's election,
writes Joel Kibazo.
Traders chose the end of the account day to take positions in front of the
impending election. However, a substantial part of the day's volume was
based on three large trades in stock options. Lasmo topped the league table
of top stock option trades. It traded a total of 5,116 contracts, and was
closely followed by Guiness with a day's total of 5,042. James Capel was
reported to have traded some 5,000 contracts in each of the above, selling
puts and stock in the process. Asda was also busy registering a total of
3,136 lots.
The FT-SE option traded a total of 11,095 contracts. By the close, turnover
in the options had reached a hefty 50,569 contracts.
In contrast, trading in stock index futures was described by one trader as
'dull' with little in the way of institutional business and independent
traders taking centre stage.
The session was volatile and June closed at 2,413, around 4 points above its
estimated fair value premium to cash of around 28. Turnover reached 4,934
lots.

FT  04 APR 92 / Money Markets: Rates stay firm
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The torpor of the last few weeks returned to the UK money market yesterday
following Wednesday's hectic activity.
The mood of uncertainty that has enveloped the market will continue, barring
a decisive lead in tomorrow's opinion polls for either of the main parties,
but dealers said prices had already gone a long way towards discounting a
Labour majority or hung-parliament.
Rates remained firm, with the three-month interbank rate holding steady at
just over 11 per cent.
The market is still discounting at least a half point rise in base rates
after the election, but a decisive one or two point rise is considered more
likely.
A substantial increase in base rates, should the markets decide to test a
new Labour government, would enable the Labour party to demonstrate its
commitment to the current value of sterling. The increase could be more
easily reversed than a half-point rise which might not satisfy the sceptical
markets.
With sterling hovering just below DM2.84, it is still about 7 pfennigs above
its DM2.7780 floor in the EMS. With funds still available to the UK, both
from the Bank of England and other European banks, some analysts suggest a
rise in base rates could be avoided through support of the UK currency.
Rates at the long end also firmed. The one year rate rose to 11 5/16 - 1/4
from 11 15/16 - 3/16 .
June short sterling opened down one basis point at 88.70 and hovered just
above before closing at 88.71.
The Bank of England supplied liquidity where necessary but the market seemed
surprisingly loath to sell out the shortage. The Bank's initial forecast
liquidity shortage was Pounds 950m which it later revised to Pounds 1bn. It
provided early assistance with the purchase of Pounds 370m band-2 bank bills
at 10- 3/8 per cent.
Later in the morning the Bank provided a further Pounds 51m of assistance
buying Pounds 25m of band-1 bank bills and Pounds 26m of band-2 bank bills,
at the same rate. It continued to operate in the afternoon buying Pounds 90m
band-2 bank bills, after revising the forecast liquidity shortage to Pounds
800m. Late assistance of Pounds 40m took total official intervention
operations for the day to Pounds 551m, leaving the market seemingly around
Pounds 250m under-relieved.
The overnight rate, in the thinly-traded closing minutes dropped to 10 1/8 -
7/8.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Bernard Tapie, France's new minister for cities, yesterday put his two
closest business associates in charge of his two main companies, to free
himself to concentrate on his political duties.
Mr Tapie, who was nominated to the French government on Thursday night, said
he would continue to control Adidas, the German sports shoe maker he bought
two years ago.
However, he said he would hand over his functions there to Mrs Gilberte
Beaux, the former banker who joined the French group during the acquisition.
At the same time, he promoted Mr Elie Fellous, finance director of the
Bernard Tapie Finances (BTF) holding group since 1998, to become BTF's
president.
Mrs Beaux, a former business associate of James Goldsmith, has handled Mr
Tapie's relations with French banks and represented him on the Adidas board.
The move comes a day after Mr Rene Jaggi, Adidas's chief executive, said he
would leave at the end of this year, possibly for the top job at Hugo Boss,
the men's fashion group.
Mr Fellous' first task will be to handle the asset disposals to fund the
final FFr726m (Dollars 129.6m) debt repayment which BTF must make by next
August, on the borrowings it incurred for the FFr1.6bn Adidas acquisition.
BTF sold La Vie Claire, the health foods group for an undisclosed sum in
February and is understood to want to sell Teston and Terraillon, the
separately-quoted makers of weighing machines.
Remy Cointreau, the French drinks group, yesterday reported a successful
public issue of 20.8 per cent of its shares, writes Philip Rawstorne.

<TEXT>
THE London stock market is to take a further stride into continental Europe
when broking firms which operate entirely outside the UK will be admitted to
its international share market.
Two Spanish broking firms, one of them owned by Banco Bilbao Vizcaya, are
understood to have applied to join Seaq International, the London exchange's
quote system which supports a large telephone market in foreign shares.
Neither broker has operations in London, putting them outside the direct
control of the UK market regulators.
The development is being delayed, however, by the need to satisfy the UK's
Financial Services Act, which governs investment business in the UK.
Under this act, the brokers will only be allowed to quote prices on Seaq
International once there is a formal memorandum of understanding between the
Spanish and UK regulatory authorities. This would allow the UK authorities
to accept the Spanish firms as being properly regulated.
No memorandum of understanding exists between the UK and Spain, although it
is believed that progress is being made to put one in place.
Some brokers quote prices on Seaq International from outside the UK,
although they have operations which come under the direct supervision of the
UK authorities. These are James Capel, S G Warburg, CCF, Credit Suisse First
Boston and Madoff Securities.

Spalvins
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   SYDNEY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
COURT proceedings against Mr John Spalvins and another former director of
the Adsteam group have been dropped, the Australian Securities Commission
(ASC) said yesterday. The ASC instigated civil proceedings against Mr
Spalvins, the former managing director of the ASC, and Mr Michael Kent, the
former finance director, in relation to US share dealings.
The ASC alleged that dealings authorised by the two men in the shares of
Adelaide Steamship and David Jones, an Adsteam group affiliate, had resulted
in a loss to David Jones.
However, the commission said it had decided to drop the case following an
agreement between the independent boards of the two companies that Adelaide
Steamship will pay ADollars 3m (USDollars 2.3m) to David Jones.
The commission said the agreement vindicated its decision to take legal
action, and noted that there was no evidence that the two directors had
benefited from the share deals.
In a statement, Mr Spalvins said he was disappointed that the commission had
thought it necessary to instigate proceedings, but pleased that the case had
been dropped.
Mr Spalvins was fired from the Adsteam group in 1990 after its bankers moved
in to restructure the group's complex web of interlocking shareholdings and
reschedule its debt. Mr Kent left the group last year.
Southern Cross Airlines, the newly-formed operator, would buy the collapsed
domestic carrier Compass Airlines through a scheme of arrangement or asset
sale, said Mr Ian Ferrier, Compass's provisional liquidator, Reuters
reports.
He said that a binding agreement had been reached with Southern Cross,
alleviating the need to obtain directions from Australia's Federal Court on
the sale. 'The sale through a scheme of arrangement will achieve a greater
return to creditors and members than a straight asset sale.'

FT  04 APR 92 / International Company News: Berlitz unveils Dollars 189.5m
loss for final quarter

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BERLITZ, the language school subsidiary of Maxwell Communication Corporation
(MCC), unveiled a Dollars 189.5m loss for the fourth quarter of 1991.
This follows Dollars 195.4m of write-offs and special charges created as a
result of MCC's filing for protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of US
bankruptcy law.
The partial cause of the write-offs was the default of MCC on certain
payments due to Berlitz.
Berlitz - which in February hired the Wall Street stockbroking firm of
Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette to advise on the possible sale or
recapitalisation of the company - discovered last year that the late Mr
Robert Maxwell had improperly pledged most of MCC's 56.5 per cent Berlitz
equity stake as collateral for bank loans. MCC filed for bankruptcy
protection last year.
At present, most of MCC's 56.5 per cent Berlitz stake is actually in the
hands of five US and European banks and companies. Injunctions have been
brought by Macmillan, the MCC publisher, to prevent the Berlitz stock from
being sold.
Yesterday, Berlitz said its fourth quarter 1991 revenues had declined to
Dollars 66.5m from Dollars 73.4m in the last three months of 1990.
The company disclosed a Dollars 9.97 per share loss in the quarter, compared
with a profit of 12 cents a share in the final quarter of 1990.

<TEXT>
Trading in shares in the M&amp;G Recovery Investment Trust started yesterday
afternoon.
By the close of trading, the M&amp;G Group held 14.482m income shares,
equivalent to 11.16 per cent of the total income shares on issue. M&amp;G
Securities, a wholly owned subsidiary of the company, accounted for 12.882m
of these shares.
The company said this represented confidence by its fund managers that the
shares were a 'good buy', and that they would make a suitable home for part
of the company's reserves.
M&amp;G's purchases helped stabilise the income shares which had a turbulent day
on the market, opening on 35p, falling to 34 1/2 p but then recovering to
35p.
Private investors, at whom the launch was targeted, mostly held packaged
units including income shares, zero dividend preference shares, and capital
shares. The packaged units, priced at 100p, closed at 97p.

FT  04 APR 92 / UK Company News: Maxwell associate told to repay Pounds 6.6m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND HUGHES, Law Courts Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR KEVIN MAXWELL gave instructions for payments totalling Pounds 6.6m from
private companies in the Maxwell empire which were used in an allegedly
unlawful share support operation, according to evidence lodged in the High
Court.
The payments came to light yesterday when the court ordered Mr Sheldon
Aboff, a New York lawyer and a long-time associate of the late Mr Robert
Maxwell, to repay the money, with interest, to the private companies.
The evidence names Mr Darryl Warnford-Davies, Mr Kevin Maxwell's
brother-in-law, and four Maxwell executives as having been involved in the
transactions.
The court documents described for the first time in detail the roles played
by Mr Kevin Maxwell and some fellow executives in the months before Mr
Robert Maxwell died and his empire collapsed.
Seven payments were made by London &amp; Bishopsgate Group, Robert Maxwell Group
and Bishopsgate Investment Trust to Mr Aboff, via stockbrokers Townsley &amp; Co
and Astaire &amp; Partners, between June and November last year.
The money was used to buy 1.7m shares in Maxwell Communication Corporation
and 760,000 shares in Mirror Group Newspapers, Mr Maxwell's two public
companies.
The court ordered Mr Aboff, a former executive of several Maxwell private
companies, to pay back the Pounds 6.6m, plus Pounds 477,065 interest, and to
deliver up certificates in respect of the MCC and MGN shares.
An order made last December freezing up to Pounds 4.35m of Mr Aboff's assets
was increased to Pounds 7m and extended until enforcement of yesterday's
judgment against him. The orders were made in actions by chartered
accountants Arthur Andersen, as administrators of the three private
companies, who were given judgment in the absence of any defence by Mr Aboff
to their claims.
Mr Mark Phillips, counsel for the administrators, told Mr Justice Hoffmann:
'Each transaction was made on the directions of one or other of the key
players - Mr Robert Maxwell or Mr Kevin Maxwell.
'We say that Mr Aboff knew these transactions were part of a share support
operation and were made in breach of the fiduciary duties of the directors.
'There was no basis on which Mr Aboff could have concluded he was entitled
to such substantial payments from these companies,' Mr Phillips said.
The evidence stated that the administrators believe the transactions were
part of an unlawful share support operation and that the borrowings of the
private companies in the Robert Maxwell Group were to a large extent secured
by the pledge of MCC and MGN shares.
'Accordingly, in order to support the level of borrowing, it was vital that
the share price of these companies, especially MCC, should be maintained.'
The administrators had identified a number of substantial flows of funds
from private group companies now in administration which had been used for
the purchase of shares in MCC and MGN in the names of offshore third parties
'where there was no corresponding benefit to the private companies in
question.'
At the time of the share transactions, Mr Warnford-Davies had been employed
by Townsley, having moved there from Astaire. The evidence mentions
memoranda which refer to Townsley and Astaire as 'very nervous people.'
Various other instructions for transfer of funds, purchase of shares or
other transactions were made by Mr Robert Bunn, finance director of many
Maxwell companies, Mr Jonathan Ford and Mr Larry Trachtenberg, who were both
London and Bishopsgate directors, and Mr Carson, then London and
Bishopsgate's legal counsel and compliance officer.

FT  04 APR 92 / UK Company News: Grampian selling Mitre for Pounds 17m as
profits decline 14.7%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GRAMPIAN HOLDINGS, the Scottish mini-conglomerate, is selling Mitre, one of
the UK's best known makers of footballs, rugby balls and sporting goods, to
an American company keen to cash in on Mitre's brand name ahead of the 1994
Football World Cup, to be staged in the US.
Grampian is selling Mitre for about Pounds 17m to Genesco Inc, the US
clothing and footwear manufacturer which already owns the Mitre licence in
North America.
The sale is expected to be finalised before Easter.
Mitre and Patrick have been separately managed, although Grampian recently
looked at combining their distribution and administration to reduce
overheads.
Mitre is the more profitable of the two companies, making pre-tax profits of
about Pounds 1.5m from sales of Pounds 14m in 1991. But the company was
affected by bad debts in the fourth quarter and Patrick, which was acquired
in 1987, has more potential in Europe.
Sale proceeds will be used to reduce borrowings of about Pounds 20m at year
end.
Grampian also announced a 14.7 per cent fall in pre-tax profits to Pounds
11.2m in the year to December 31, below expectations. The shares fell 9p to
163p on news of the results and sale.
Earnings fell less sharply, due to a lower tax charge, and totalled 12.77p,
an 8.8 per cent fall. Grampian is recommending a final dividend of 3.8p
(3.5p), to make a total of 5.5p, a 10 per cent increase.
Turnover improved 1.9 per cent to Pounds 142.8m, mainly due to strong
performances from animal pharmaceuticals in the UK and Germany.
COMMENT
Disposing of Mitre, with apparently no pressing need to do so, raises the
question of what else is for sale. Patrick is a likely candidate, although
Grampian may prefer to wait for its premium brand name credentials to be
acknowledged in any price tag. Mitre's sale also accelerates Grampian's
transition from conglomerate to niche pharmaceuticals company. Animal
pharmaceuticals increased their share of group profit above 50 per cent for
the first time last year. Following the disposal and the purchase of Peter
Hand, that figure is set to top 60 per cent this year. Even so, the market
still sees the company as a conglomerate and wants further evidence of
pharmaceuticals growth before any re-rating. Forecast profits of Pounds
12.5m put the shares on 12 times and make Grampian an interesting hold.

FT  04 APR 92 / UK Company News: Brabant Pounds 4.9m in red after write-down
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Brabant Resources, the USM-quoted oil and gas exploration and production
company, announced a net loss of Pounds 4.92m for 1991. That compared with
profits of Pounds 364,000 for the nine months to December 1990.
Tax took Pounds 100,000 (nil) and losses per share were 29.6p (5.1p
earnings).
The company said the loss was because of the 'prudent decision' to write
down the value of unproved exploration assets by Pounds 4.7m in view of the
current low oil price and lack of exploration success.
Turnover was Pounds 2.88m (Pounds 1.38m) and net oil production jumped to an
average of 1,172 (780) barrels of oil a day.

Exceptional costs hit Usher-Walker, the printing inks group, in 1991 and its
pre-tax profit fell from Pounds 400,000 to Pounds 60,000.
There was a charge of Pounds 332,000 for stock write-offs and reorganisation
aimed at lowering the cost base.
Operating profit moved up to Pounds 643,000 (Pounds 632,000) on turnover of
Pounds 16.7m (Pounds 17m) as a result of continuing cost reductions and
improvements in ink formulations. Those factors offset poorer figures from
the roller division.
After tax there were losses per share of 0.4p (earnings 7.1p). The directors
said the group was well placed to take advantage of economic recovery, and
are lifting the dividend from 5.5p to 6p with a final of 4p.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
NMW Computers, the stock processing bureau, fell into the red in the year to
December 31, as a result of recession, low levels of stock market activity
and continued losses from Charterhouse Group, acquired in May.
The dividend is passed: last year 0.5p was paid.
At the pre-tax level, losses came to Pounds 207,000 (profits Pounds
413,000), even though turnover advanced to Pounds 10.6m (Pounds 8.73m).
But the losses at Charterhouse were much reduced, and with its acquisition
NMW had now diversified away from the securities industry. The financial
services division had, however, traded profitably and was now dependent on
stock market volumes for only half its revenue.
There was an extraordinary charge of Pounds 111,000 (nil). Losses per share
emerged at 0.9p (earnings 1.3p).

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SHARE price of Arthur Shaw crashed 58 per cent yesterday after the
company announced it was in loss and would not pay a final dividend. The
maker of builders' hardware and engineering products supplier saw its shares
fall from 50p to 21p.
It said because of adverse conditions experienced in the second half, the
results for the year to March 31 1992 would show a loss. And that would be
exacerbated by exceptional charges for reorganisation and redundancies.
In the long term interests of shareholders a final dividend would not be
paid.
Shaw maintained its interim dividend at 1.3p although pre-tax profits for
the first half fell from Pounds 235,000 to Pounds 113,000, and earnings per
share were down to 0.9p (2p).

FT  04 APR 92 / UK Company News: Hartstone Dollars 50m debt replacement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hartstone, the hosiery and leather goods group, yesterday announced a
Dollars 50m debt replacement which will eliminate virtually all of its
sterling borrowings and hedge against currency moves on its US assets.
Mr Stephen Barker, chairman, said the decision to place Dollars 50m in debt
with three US institutions would benefit interest charges in the current
year.
The debt was placed at an effective rate of 8.4 per cent for almost seven
years. This compares with previous shorter-term sterling borrowings at an
average of about 11 to 11.5 per cent.
The effect of transferring the debt would also offset higher tax charges on
profits made in the US. Hartstone bought leather goods manufacturers,
Etienne Aigner and Michael Stevens, for Dollars 120m in March last year and
has US assets of about Dollars 40m, roughly 37 per cent of the group total.
Hartstone, which is expected next month to report profits of some Pounds
22.5m for the year to March 31, will have debt representing about 45 per
cent of shareholders' funds after the proceeds are used to reduce UK
borrowings. Interest cover would be about eight times, said Mr Barker.
The three institutions are believed to be leading insurance companies active
in the private placement market. Mr Barker said the institutions had
indicated they were prepared to increase the levels of debt 'as and when we
make any further moves'.

FT  04 APR 92 / UK Company News: Drayton Cons provision hits Invesco MIM
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FUTURE of the Drayton Consolidated Investment Trust, a leading UK
investment trust in the development and venture capital sector, hangs in the
balance following a 23 per cent decline in profits at the fund's manager and
12 per cent stake holder, Invesco MIM.
Pre-tax profits fell from Pounds 18.9m to Pounds 14.5m for the year to
December 31, on turnover 59 per cent higher at Pounds 2.77bn.
The result was struck after exceptional charges of Pounds 13m on potential
losses at Drayton Consolidated, which invests in small and unquoted UK
companies.
Invesco, headed by Lord Stevens of Ludgate, said yesterday the trust had
appointed brokers County NatWest Wood Mackenzie and Cazenove to review
proposals on its future.
Earlier this year, Drayton Consolidated revealed that about 11 per cent of
its portfolio - or Pounds 19.8m - was virtually irretrievable following the
collapse of its largest investment, the Scottish confectionery company,
Alma.
The trusts shares have fallen from 204p in January to last night's 176p.
The troubles at Drayton Consolidated masked strong performances around the
world from Invesco's main operating divisions.
Stripping out exceptional provisions of Pounds 16.6m, which included Pounds
3.6m for losses on Invesco's employee share option trust, pre-tax profits
rose by 39 per cent to Pounds 31.1m. Funds under management grew by 24 per
cent to Pounds 31bn.
The proposed final dividend was held at 3.7p for a total of 6p. Earnings per
share fell from 5.4p to 2.3p. The retained loss for the year was Pounds
8.3m, compared with a profit of Pounds 2.65m last time.
The North American operations increased profits by 45 per cent to Dollars
47m (Pounds 27m). Mr Ratan Engineer, Invesco's finance director, said the
company had benefited from a mutual fund boom in the US. 'We also had an
outstanding investment performance.' Trading in the US continued to be very
strong, he said.
Cost-cutting in the UK helped the European and Pacific division increase
profits by 27 per cent to Pounds 10.3m. Mr Engineer dismissed the prospect
of a pick up in the UK in the short term. 'I do not see much of a change
even after the election,' he said.
The move into Japan was proving successful, but would not return significant
profits for some time, Mr Engineer said. He added that Invesco had become
the first foreign manager in Japan to win a corporate pension fund account.
Debt at the year end was Dollars 60m and comprised a convertible loan note
held by the group's US partners.

FT  04 APR 92 / UK Company News: Scottish TV declines to Pounds 8.6m
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SCOTTISH TELEVISION, which won back its franchise with a bid of Pounds 2,000
a year yesterday announced pre-tax profits of Pounds 8.6m for 1991, a fall
of 23 per cent.
Mr Bill Brown, chairman, said that in a year of recession the company had
demonstrated 'its ability to weather difficult times and to produce results
which are among the best in our industry'.
The shares closed up 40p at 750p. He added that although there had been fall
of Pounds 2.6m in pre-tax profits the company's share of total advertising
had increased with sales of Pounds 88.2m (Pounds 89m) and programmes sales
to the ITV network had held up at Pounds 17.5m, compared with Pounds 18.2m.
Total turnover was up slightly at Pounds 114.2m, against Pounds 114.1m.
Scottish has decided to increase the proposed final dividend to 13.125p
(11.5p) for a total of 16p (14.375p).
This is because it anticipates recovery this year and also because of the
'favourable prospects' for the new licence period, which will start next
year.
The company is also proposing a 1-for-1 share split to make the shares more
marketable.
Mr Neil Blackley, media analyst at stockbrokers James Capel yesterday
forecast pre-tax profits of Pounds 14m this year and a provisional Pounds
20m for 1993.
Mr Brown said advertising revenue was showing some signs of growth for the
first time in two years. 'Having held steady in recession, Scottish
Television is now ready for real growth.'

Shares in ATP Communications, the USM-quoted advertising group, were
suspended yesterday at 1 1/2 p after the company began talks with its
bankers. Shareholders had earlier voted against a capital reorganisation at
an extraordinary meeting.
Last month ATP told shareholders that the continued existence of the company
depended on the capital reorganisation which involved a Pounds 1m share
issue. Shareholders were offered two new shares for every one held, at a
price of 2p. The proposals included the conversion of the group's preference
shares into ordinary shares.
The reorganisation proposals needed a 75 per cent majority at the
shareholder meeting to succeed.

FT  04 APR 92 / UK Company News: Leading UK and European institutions to
shun WMI
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW FREEMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SEVERAL LEADING UK and European institutions have decided to shun the Pounds
465m flotation of Waste Management International (WMI) which enters its last
lap next week.
Despite heavy pressure from Cazenove and Merrill Lynch, brokers and lead
underwriter respectively, the institutions say they will avoid the
international offer and placing of 20 per cent of the shares in WMI, the
overseas arm of Waste Management Inc, the leading US waste disposal company.
However, demand from the US is expected to be strong enough to allow the
flotation to be successfully completed.
The UK institutions are worried about the high indicated price of the shares
and the ambitious growth assumptions made for WMI in the issue prospectus.
One London-based fund manager said: 'They are over-priced and over here.'
European investors have also expressed concern about the timing of the
flotation in light of the uncertain outlook for equities ahead of the UK
general election.
The shares are due to be priced in the US on Monday night, before
preliminary dealings begin on Tuesday. UK fund managers said yesterday the
price for the UK placing was likely to be around 620p, against an indicated
range of 530-645p. That would value the whole of WMI at Pounds 2.3bn and put
the shares on a multiple of 34 times the pro-forma 1991 earnings per share.
However, the company expects to show rapid earnings growth in the next few
years, which will bring the multiple down to less demanding levels.
US investors are reportedly keen to switch into the fast-growing overseas
subsidiary of the US parent, WM Inc. Since the beginning of March, shares in
WM Inc have fallen from Dollars 43 to below Dollars 38 as funds have sold
ahead of the WMI flotation. They are more comfortable with the high earnings
multiple on the new shares, and have the additional protection of the
dollar's strength against sterling.
Some UK funds said they will buy the WMI shares, but intend to sell them in
early dealings.
The proximity of the planned sale of a further large tranche of shares in
Wellcome, the drugs company, to which Cazenove is also the broker, has made
some investors nervous that if they refuse to participate in the WMI sale
they will prejudice their applications for Wellcome stock.

Sir, Speaking as one who holds a Scottish Higher leaving certificate, I
refer to your report ('Baccalaureate urged instead of Scots exam', March 6)
about suggested changes to the Scottish Higher exam.
Broadly, Professor Howie is asking for the Scottish education system to have
both breadth and depth and not simply the breadth that it has at present. If
our children are to be educated in breadth and depth then the government
will have to be prepared to pay for longer periods spent at school and in
the university. Our university graduates qualify when they are 2l and at the
latest perhaps 23, whereas in Germany and France 25 and 26 is not unusual.

FT  04 APR 92 / Letter: Lloyd's - even-handedness of results and divine
rights
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr JULIAN CRISPIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, We fully endorse the point made by Keith Leonard (Letters, April 2)
concerning the proper way to compare the underwriting performance of
external and working Lloyd's Names.
Our own analysis of Names' results for the last three closed years of 1986,
1987 and 1988 shows a small difference in favour of external Names in the
first two years and in favour of working Names in the third. The pattern
appears to be that our external Names have fared better in years of good
profit (1986 and 1987) and worse in the poor year of 1988. This same pattern
was apparent in the Task Force Report.
The forecasts for our Names for the loss year of 1989 produce an
insignificant difference of 0.11 per cent between the two groups.
Members' agents should not favour working Names over external Names or vice
versa, and the evidence from the two leading Members' agents is that they
have been even-handed. What is needed in this debate is more light and
rather less heat.

From Mr G C Ranard.
Sir, Mr Keith Leonard, managing director of one of Lloyd's of London's most
substantial managing agents, has described as 'vocational' the occupation of
working in the Lloyd's insurance market.
The first definition given for the word vocation in the Concise Oxford
Dictionary is a 'divine call'.
I am aware that 'insider' names may be benefiting from privileged syndicate
selection, but I suppose it is natural that they also assume a divine right
to such woeful injustice.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr CHRISTOPHER BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, County Hall has been sold to the Japanese for Pounds 60m. Further
substantial sums will be expended converting it into a hotel, apartments and
conference facilities. If the sale stands, overseas funds will be injected
into Britain, employment will be created and the building and hospitality
businesses will benefit. All, one might think, desirable ends in these
difficult times.
However, it is reported that if Labour forms the next government it will
cancel the sale and install its planned 'slimline' Greater London Authority
in County Hall. If the objective of creating a GLA is efficient,
forward-looking government for London, why set it up in an antiquated,
inefficient building requiring costly and time-consuming renovation? Such a
course seems peculiar, bearing in mind the wide choice of high quality
offices available in London.
Presumably, this is an example of the soft-headed economic decision-making
the country can look forward to if Labour prevails next Thursday.

FT  04 APR 92 / Letter: Stability is what large section of business wants
from politicians
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr GORDON BRACE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, British business overwhelmingly desires a Conservative victory, you say
in your leading article ('Weakness at the Tory heart', April 1). If your
measure is financial clout, that's doubtless true, but if you mean head
count (which wins elections), I wonder.
I attended a west Midlands Confederation of British Industry evening seminar
on 'partnership supply' this week. The first half hour was largely devoted
to a panegyric by Sir John Banham, the CBI director-general, on industry's
achievements over 'the last 13 years' - a thinly-veiled plea to vote
Conservative and hardly bearing on the topic for which the attendees had
paid Pounds 50.
At the supper which followed, a straw poll among the eight apparently
'random' delegates with whom l found myself yielded only two who claimed to
be Tory voters.
No doubt 'City-based' commerce, with its emphasis on buying and selling
companies rather than goods, is solidly Conservative and no doubt the
recipients of salaries of a third of a million pounds and upwards (who write
to The Times and appoint director-generals of the CBI) also see their best
interests served by Conservatives. But what the thousands of people who
manage medium-sized enterprises or own small ones - and who in an uncertain
world are judged by their ability to deliver what they forecast - really
want is stability.
No-one enjoys paying tax, but higher on most people's wish list is to do
one's job in an environment of reasonably stable exchange rates, interest
rates and legislative environment and to be able to recruit staff who can
read and write. The worst scenario is regular about-turns.
Whether that resolves itself into voting Conservative or into a push for the
constitutional changes favoured by the Liberal Democrats remains to be seen.
The latter might have more durable results.

FT  04 APR 92 / The empire strikes back: John Griffiths on the man and the
machines behind McLaren-Honda
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When he lowers himself into 'Red Five', the nickname of his Canon
Williams-Renault formula one car, for the Brazilian Grand Prix tomorrow,
Britain's Nigel Mansell will be determined but uneasy.
Deep down he knows all too well, even if he cannot readily admit it to
himself, that the euphoria of his British supporters at his runaway wins in
the first two rounds of this year's world championship could prove
short-lived.
The road towards his first world championship, for which - at age 38 - he is
now desperate, may be barred again by the familiar fluorescent red and white
of rival Marlboro McLaren-Hondas driven by arch-rival and world champion
Brazilian Ayrton Senna, and his Austrian team-mate Gerhard Berger.
The Williams team, and lesser rivals such as Benetton Ford, have good reason
for their private unease. The plethora of red-and-white cars emerging from
air freighters in Sao Paulo this week make up a technological package with
which McLaren hopes to wrest back the advantage it has yielded to Mansell
and Williams this season.
There was seemingly enough electronic and telemetry (remote data
transmission) gear to start a space programme. Developed by TAG
International Systems, a McLaren subsidiary, it is used to monitor
information produced by more than 800 sensors in each car. Crouched over
their display terminals in the race track's pits, McLaren's engineers can
observe and analyse everything about the car's behaviour while it is
hurtling round the track. In this latest twist of technology, the pits team
can alter, by remote control, fuel mixture, the engine speed at which the
semi-automatic gearbox changes gear, or dozens of other parameters without
the driver so much as lifting his foot off the throttle.
The two McLaren drivers have six cars at their disposal, rather than the
usual three or four. Three of them, designated MP4/7As, are the new model on
which McLaren has staked its credibility, and that of its partner Honda.
In secret development for a year, the cars employ 'drive-by-wire' technology
which will take Senna and Berger partly into the unknown, in terms of
driving techniques, as well as - McLaren hopes - back into the victory lane.
There is, for example, no mechanical link between the driver and
accelerator, or between the press-button gearbox controls and the gearbox
itself. The driver's physical commands are relayed electronically. The
engine and gearbox decide between them whether the driver has changed down
too early, while travelling too fast.
In the recent past, that would have meant an over-revved, and probably
exploded, engine. Now, the system can 'ignore' the gearchange for a few
microseconds while engine speed is adjusted to suit.
It is on this state-of-the art technology that the McLaren-Honda team is
pinning its hopes. Having dominated motor racing for most of the past
decade, the Anglo-Japanese team lost its edge to Williams - a situation
which Ron Dennis, founder, part owner and managing director of McLaren
International, does not relish.
For Honda, which has spent much of the past decade cultivating an image as
'Japan's BMW' and thus has a strongly commercial stake in McLaren's success,
the current scenario is no less galling. Unreasonable as it is to expect any
team to carry on winning the world championship ad infinitum, Honda's
relegation comes at a time when Grand Prix motor racing, worldwide, has
gained unprecedented popularity. The Pounds 1bn a year industry attracts at
least 100m television viewers worldwide for each Grand Prix event.
Dennis, 45, who now controls a small high-tech empire employing nearly 400
in an industrial estate in Woking, Surrey, has already become a legend in
motor racing for the clinical precision with which he has approached
winning.
His perfectionism extends even to insisting that the 30-strong pit team has
all new clothing for every Grand Prix. Combined with his intuitive
engineering and managerial skills - he went straight from school in Woking
into engineering - it has earned him the grudging respect of McLaren's
rivals.
It is all the more surprising, therefore, that McLaren should, for the
moment, be on the defensive.
Dennis admits that McLaren was lulled into a false sense of security by
Senna winning the opening four rounds of the championship last year. He
concluded that McLaren's cars were sufficiently superior to its rivals for
the company to get on with developing the far more advanced MP4/7A for 1992.
But by mid-season the Williams team had overcome its initial unreliability
and was outpacing the McLarens.
Recalls Dennis ruefully: 'Grand Prix is like a roundabout. The music starts,
everyone gets on, it increases speed through the season and only slows down
when the season ends. And it's very difficult to do anything when you're on
the horse. The tools keep sliding off. All the team can do is hold on tight;
sometimes the less well-organised teams don't even know if they're sitting
on the horse backwards.
'The moment you lose your balance, you're history.'
Dennis has no intention of becoming history. Indeed, the group he founded is
in the process of metamorphosing into a multi-faceted business in which
Grand Prix racing will play only a part, though a key one.
Within the next few months, McLaren Cars will launch its first road-going
car, an exclusive Pounds  1/2 m machine appropriately named F1 and
incorporating much of the technology of the Grand Prix cars.
Much of that technology will have been developed by TAG Electronic Systems,
which is turning over more than Pounds 15m annually and employs about 100
people. There is also a marketing services company and McLaren International
itself, the Grand Prix enterprise. The usually reticent Dennis observes:
'The group is at a crossroads. It is emerging as a corporate entity.'
As the drivers climb into their McLarens tomorrow, putting their skills and
technology to the test, it will not be the balance sheet that matters, but
taking the chequered flag.

FT  04 APR 92 / Leading Article: The City holds its breath
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
IT HAS been a grim week in the City of London. The FT-SE 100 Index has lost
more than 65 points and gilt-edged have continued to weaken. Sterling took a
late dive yesterday and has lost more than 2 pfennigs on the week. There is
no glummer place in Britain than the City, as Labour apparently strengthens
its position in the closing stages of the election campaign. But to what
extent does the Square Mile's gloom reflect a genuine reaction to national
economic prospects under Labour, as opposed to the personal anxieties of
City practitioners over the sharply increased personal tax burden that would
await them under a Labour administration?
Taking the country as a whole, the impact of the proposed redistribution of
taxes will be a matter of minuses and pluses. But in the south-east of
England the losers will predominate, and nowhere will this be more true than
in the City of London. Heavily-mortgaged City workers face a double threat
to their capital as well as their income, because the cut in take home pay
may well be compounded by further weakness in the already battered London
and Home Counties housing market.
The tax argument can, of course, be taken rather further than its personal
impact. The financial markets have become much more international over the
13 years since Labour was last in power. Heavy volumes of foreign equities
are traded on the Stock Exchange's SEAQ International market. There are big
markets in international bonds, for which the City is the leading European
trading centre. London is the largest global centre for foreign exchange
trading. In order to participate in these dynamic markets, many
international companies and individuals have come to London. There is a
danger that high levels of personal taxation will persuade them that they
might be better off elsewhere.
Fat cats
A squeeze on the City fat cats will not arouse much sympathy in, say, the
north-east or in Scotland. Londoners have enjoyed rich times under
successive Conservative governments: they scarcely noticed the recession of
the early 1980s. And there is a respectable, if flawed, argument for saying
that an overdeveloped international financial centre may have damaging
effects on the domestic economy if it draws too many talented people and too
much capital away from home markets.
Labour does not appear to have an anti-City policy as such. Indeed, its
manifesto argues that the future European Central Bank should have its
headquarters in Britain. But it does not appear to have considered whether
foreign institutions can be attracted to a country which charges - at 59 per
cent - one of the highest marginal rates of income tax in Europe.
In the 1970s, it is true, nominal tax rates were even higher, but they were
quite easily avoided. Large tax allowances were available on mortgage
interest and pension contributions. Perks such as company cars were highly
tax-efficient. And foreigners enjoyed a special tax regime: only half their
income was taxed in the UK. The Conservatives subsequently cut the top
rates, but they also capped or axed most of the tax breaks, including the
foreigner's exemption. Labour's increased rate will therefore bite very hard
indeed.
Financial regulation
Technology has advanced tremendously too. Computers can communicate almost
instantaneously between different centres. International financial services
groups can quite easily relocate people and functions according to shifts in
relative costs.
Nor does London have quite the regulatory advantages that it enjoyed in the
1960s and 1970s. Then, centres like Frankfurt and Paris were inward-looking
and quite hostile to international operators. London seized the
opportunities. Now Paris has become aggressively international and Germany
is touting the concept of Finanzplatz Deutschland. All the EC centres are
coming within a harmonised framework of financial regulation.
In recent years, governments have found it hard to impose taxes on
international financial markets. Germany had to withdraw legislation on bond
withholding tax and the UK was forced to climb down on the rate of stamp
duty it attempted to impose on American Depositary Receipts. Governments
also need to be mindful of the international implications of personal tax
rates. The potential tax revenues may be alluring, but they will prove to be
a moving target.
It would be bad enough for a Labour administration to attempt to downsize
the City of London for reasons of deliberate policy: for it to take the risk
of crippling Europe's premier financial centre thoughtlessly would be
absurd. In practice, a Labour chancellor might well have to offer tax
concessions to foreigners in order to prevent high-paid financial
practitioners from drifting away to Frankfurt, Paris, or New York. It may be
hard for immobile British politicians to comprehend, but levying high taxes
on practitioners in international financial markets may be one thing,
collecting them quite another.

little more than a third of the bill facing Russell, 18, on Pounds 4,500 a
year and 80p a month over the limit for a rebate, the family was angry and
highly critical of the government and the poll tax. 'It really got me,' said
Lyn, Russell's mother.
'It's got my back up over the Conservative government,' rejoined first time
voting Russell.
'Bills. We're getting ours through now. The Conservatives should have
scrapped it straight away,' complained Tony, father of the family.
'It's the one big mistake of the Tories and they'll never live it down,' Lyn
came back.
'They've spent billions trying to get it right, but it's the government's
job to get it right first time,' said Russell. 'It's the number one
influence.'
'But it's over now,' Lyn reminded him. And so it is. The poll tax does not
figure much in the party political debate, but the bills plopping through
letter boxes are a reminder of one of Mrs Thatcher's less adroit moves, part
of the record which will be judged by floating voters such as the Martins.
For them, it has not been a very satisfactory week as the debate has twisted
from issue to issue. The tax issue came up again, of course. The Martins
rather like Mr Ashdown's honesty in his commitment to put an extra penny on
income tax to pay for education.
'The only thing that has come over to us,' Tony remarked of the Tory
campaign, 'is that they're trying to put income tax down to 20p, but they
haven't said when.'
As for Labour's plans to tax higher incomes more heavily, Lyn said, 'That
would never affect us. It wouldn't sway us not to vote for them.'
'The Tories have brought taxes down,' Tony observed. 'It's six to one, half
a dozen the other,' shrugged Lyn.
'To get the country right, you've got to pay for it,' Tony persisted.
'The way the people will vote depends on how much they've got in their pay
packets at the end of the week,' Russell said dismissively.
Still, the Martins accept that the economy is the central issue. They remain
uncertain about the political approach to it. 'We know we're in a recession.
No party is going to come in, wave a magic wand and all the figures will
change,' Tony said.
'It'll be a long haul for everyone,' Lyn agreed.
Tony put his priority on the line: 'What they've got to do is to stop the
job losses.'
Lyn didn't think Labour plans for a minimum wage would help employment.
'That's not going to create jobs,' she argued.
'It's going to put people out of jobs,' asserted Tony, adding, on general
economic policy, 'Nobody has come through.'
'You can't say anybody's got it sorted,' said Lyn. But as the Liberal
Democrats have become the butt of Labour and Conservative attacks, sympathy,
even enthusiasm, for Mr Ashdown came through.
Tony began to hoist his colours: 'Of the the three leaders, Paddy Ashdown
would make the best prime minister if his party was stronger.'
'I've said all along that if you vote for the Lib Dems, you take it off John
Major,' Russell warned.
'They're quoting 47 per cent of the people wanting to vote Liberal
Democrat,' Tony came back.
'The polls aren't proving that,' Lyn reminded him.
Russell was cautious. 'My heart is telling me to vote Liberal Democrat. My
head is telling me to vote Conservative. But, saying that, Labour has come
up with a good . . . '
'Some of the things Labour have come up with make sense.' Lyn picked up the
sentence.
'A coalition . . . ' Tony half formed the thought.
'Kinnock is so domineering,' Lyn responded. 'But I don't think he'd get it.
At least Paddy Ashdown is his own man. He's doing it for the country. He's
got his views and he sticks to them.'
'He's come over honest. He's the common man's choice,' Russell agreed.

FT  04 APR 92 / Election 92: The strategists fail to locate the majority of
voters - Women's issues have been given little airing in the campaign
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTIAN TYLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WOMEN constitute the biggest minority in British politics. Indeed, they are
actually a majority of the electorate. But whether there is such a thing as
'the women's vote' is another matter.
The fact that women voters outnumber men is duly recognised in the main
parties' manifestos, yet women's issues have been given little airing. The
politicians may dream of capturing the female vote, but their strategists
cannot seem to locate it.
Surveys suggest that women do think differently about political issues at
voting time - and the 'War of Jennifer's Ear' seems to have driven them
towards the Liberal Democrats in recent days.
However, history shows that the difference does not give any party a clear
advantage: psephologically speaking, women's concerns cancel out.
There was a small but visible gender gap 20-30 years ago, according to Dr
Anthony Heath of Nuffield College, Oxford, co-director of the British
Election Survey. 'But I haven't seen much sign of one now.' What was a
pronounced bias in favour of the Conservatives has been dwindling since
1974, and disappears altogether if adjustment is made for the biological
fact of women's longevity.
Dr Heath suggests there may be sub-categories where political choices are
more marked: among young, highly- educated women, for example. But he has
not detected any macro-effect.
When asked by the pollsters to list their priorities, women unfailingly put
'caring' concerns at the top: they want more tax relief for looking after
old people, more investment in the health service, more nursery school
places or subsidised child care, followed by more part-time job
opportunities.
These demands would seem to give Labour or Liberal Democrats the edge; yet
on the other side of the scale weigh issues such as law and order - the
urban woman's fear of attack is hard to overstate - which are natural Tory
territory.
Perhaps this self-correcting bias in the 'women's vote' explains why party
leaders are insouciant about another feature of women's political behaviour
before polling day: the large percentage who are 'don't knows'.
For example, Gallup's first poll of the campaign for the Daily Telegraph
found far more women than men uncommitted on all but three of 45 questions
put.
Professor Anthony King, of Essex University, has suggested that men feel
more bound to express a view. Many men who claim to have opinions may be
'merely showing off'. Mr Heath thinks women may be generally less interested
than men in politics. 'Perhaps men only worry about things they cannot
control while women are the opposite.'
The sex of candidates and ministers makes little difference to the voters,
for all the inter-party rivalry about whose gender record is better.
A recent NOP poll for The Independent found that 83 per cent of women were
indifferent to the sex of their candidates (compared with 90 per cent of
men). A smaller majority - 58 per cent of both sexes - said Britain would be
no better or worse governed if women had half the seats in the House of
Commons and in the cabinet.
The toppling of Mrs Margaret Thatcher as Conservative party leader has,
however, made more of an impression on women than on men. Broadly, they are
happier with Mr John Major.
The Tories are making little of the women's vote. They have a spokesperson
on women's issues - Mrs Angela Rumbold, junior Home Office minister - but
she is not sure there is a women's vote.
'Everybody says that child care is what women want,' she says. 'But for
every woman who asks for child care, there is another who may resent the
idea.'
The Tories think that to offer more than they already have - tax relief on
child-minding provided by an employer - would be expensive and of dubious
electoral benefit among their older female supporters.
Instead, Mrs Rumbold attacks Labour's promise of a statutory minimum wage
(which Labour thinks will be especially popular with women) as a threat to
the part-time jobs that many working wives depend upon.
The Conservatives are trying to convey a positive image while fighting shy
of anything that smacks of tokenism. So they have proposed a 'special unit'
inside the Department of Employment to monitor women's opportunities, while
dismissing Labour's proposed ministry for women as patronising and
unworkable.
Ms Jo Richardson, who would probably become Labour's first minister for
women, agrees that there is 'no such thing as a woman's issue separate from
a man's issue.' But she claims the idea of a separate ministry or reserved
cabinet seat is popular, even with men, in Labour's private polling and has
proved its worth in other countries, such as France, Germany Austria,
Jamaica, Zimbabwe and New Zealand. 'We have had 13 years with no women's
voice in the cabinet and no real woman's voice: I don't count Mrs Thatcher
as a woman's voice,' Ms Richardson says.
Labour says it will persuade local authorities to provide nursery schooling
for three and four-year-olds, and child minding for mothers who want it. Ms
Richardson hopes to steal the Tories' clothes on law and order, too. 'We
want to see more policemen on the beat and better street lighting. We are
very much going down that road.'
The Liberal Democrats' champion is Ms Ray Michie, their sole woman MP, who
represents the farmers and fishermen of Argyll and Bute. The party promises
child care vouchers worth up to Pounds 75 a week and a bigger say for women
at Westminster (and in the proposed Scottish assembly) through proportional
representation. But Ms Michie dismisses a women's ministry as 'almost
tokenistic'.

PLAID CYMRU, the Welsh nationalist party, yesterday declared that it would
not enter any political deals with the London-based parties if there were a
hung parliament, Anthony Moreton writes.
'Our priority is that a Welsh parliament should be set up within a year of a
new government taking office,' said Mr Dafydd Wigley, the party's president
and MP for Caernarfon in the last parliament.
But Mr Wigley did leave the door ajar.
'There is no question of Plaid Cymru entering into a coalition,' he said.
'Our MPs would keep their hands free to consider every issue in the House of
Commons on its merits. We will consider the proposals in the first Queen's
Speech of the new parliament in the light of the policies in our manifesto.'
Plaid Cymru held three seats in the last parliament.
Mr Wigley was speaking as an NOP poll for HTV television suggested that
Labour would win the Tory-held marginal Cardiff Central by a big majority.

FT  04 APR 92 / Accountancy interests 'dominated auditing'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AUDITING POLICY has historically been dominated by views that have favoured
the leading accountancy firms above other interests, an academic said
yesterday.
Speaking at an auditing conference organised by Bristol Business School, Mr
Prem Sikka, of the Polytechnic of East London, analysed the development of
the 'going concern' auditing guideline required for the approval of company
accounts.
He said the definition of a going concern in the guidelines was designed to
'minimise audit effort and maximise protection from lawsuits'.
The guidelines were drawn up by the Auditing Practices Committee, which did
not publish its voting and which had a membership dominated by large
accountancy firms.
Mr Sikka also emphasised that the use of the word 'profession' in relation
to the practice of accountancy was loaded, suggesting knowledge, altruism
and a pursuit of the public interest.
He suggested that in reality the leading firms were 'significant businesses
which have to secure a favourable environment to make profits, avoid
lawsuits and retain their legitimacy'.
He did not consider the role of the new Auditing Practices Board. The board,
which was created last year, includes a majority of non-practising
accountants.
Environmental auditing is still interpreted in a wide range of different
ways, Ms Josephine Maltby told the conference.
Commenting on the results of a survey of environmental auditors, she
concluded that their perceptions of the purpose of the audit and the way in
which it was conducted varied considerably.

FT  04 APR 92 / SIB issues defence of 'soft commission'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Securities and Investments Board, the City's chief investment regulator,
yesterday turned down calls for a ban on so-called 'soft commission' share
trading and issued its strongest statement in defence of the practice.
Under soft commission arrangements institutional investors promise to give
business to a particular broker. In return they receive facilities that help
them do their job, such as information services or screens carrying market
news and data.
Critics say the arrangements prevent investors from shopping round to get
the best deal for their own clients each time they trade.
The practice was criticised recently in a speech by Mr Peter Rawlins, chief
executive of the London Stock Exchange, when he called on pension fund
investment managers to drop soft commissions. He added: 'To the average man,
if people want a service, they should be prepared to pay visibly for it in a
currency everyone understands.'
Yesterday the SIB said it had noted calls to review its policy on soft
commissions, or to ban the practice, but it had decided no change was
necessary.
'Soft commission arrangements provide a legitimate means for fund managers
to obtain specialist services,' the board said. 'The payment of commission
in return for an array of services in addition to execution, which benefit
the fund manager's clients, is a traditional feature of the marketplace.'
The SIB said that to prevent abuse it had developed a framework to define
the services that could be provided, to keep customers informed and to
ensure that 'transactions are carried out on terms no different from those
involving a traditional commission arrangement'.
Those regulatory arrangements should be given a chance to settle down, the
SIB said, adding that trustees 'should be alert to the implications for fund
beneficiaries of such arrangements'.
The SIB also said yesterday it would take no action to limit the ability of
integrated investment houses to undertake soft commission business. It had
started a review of the subject, prompted by moves by some integrated houses
to cut soft commission rates to win business.

FT  04 APR 92 / Carlton lacks news supply for teletext bid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CARLTON Communications' bid for a 10-year public teletext licence has been
made without a contract for a news supplier.
Unlike the other four bidders for the licence at present held by Oracle, the
commercial teletext company, Carlton was unable to reach agreement with the
Press Association, the UK news agency that supplies most newspapers and
broadcasters.
Carlton, the television facilities and production company that won the
London weekday licence from Thames Television, is bidding in a joint venture
with Intelfax.
The company has accompanied its bid with a confidential letter suggesting
how it would obtain its news supply if it won the bid battle. One suggestion
is that Independent Television News could be the news supplier.
ITN, however, is trying to win the franchise itself in a joint venture with
MAI Broadcasting, Scottish Television and Anglia Television.
Carlton argues that it will easily negotiate a news contract if it wins the
licence. Rivals argue that the lack of a contract might lead to Carlton's
failing the initial quality threshold.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CONFUSION yesterday surrounded an apparent threat by Libya to the commercial
interests of countries which voted to impose sanctions over a Libyan refusal
to hand over two men accused of the Lockerbie bombing.
The threat was originally made by student protesters on Libyan television.
However, officials in Tripoli were unable to clarify the situation. It could
affect countries such as France, whose Elf Aquitaine oil company has
significant interests in Libya.
A Libyan spokesman was quoted as saying: 'The statement of the crowds has
not so far become official.'
The British Foreign Office said it was awaiting clarification on the
apparent threat, which would affect a number of UK companies in Libya, but
it was not yet treating it as official policy.
A senior Libyan diplomat told European ambassadors in Tripoli that countries
which had supported the sanctions would have their interests 'negatively
affected', but gave few details. EC diplomats in Tripoli were seeking an
official Libyan denial of the protesters' threat.
Libyan officials were also vague over the protesters' call that countries
which backed the UN sanctions should evacuate their nationals from Libya.
Thousands of Britons, Americans and French work in Libya's oil industry - a
sector traditionally cushioned from political upheaval.
Mr Douglas Hurd, the British foreign secretary, reported after a telephone
conversation with Mr Allen Brown, head of the British interests section in
the Italian embassy in Tripoli, that the British community was calm and that
'quite a number' of exit visas were slowly being issued to those seeking to
leave.
But Mr Hurd told BBC radio: 'It's still very confused.'

FT  04 APR 92 / Japanese post record trade surplus
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN'S current account surplus rose to a monthly record of Dollars 10.8bn
(Pounds 6.2bn) in February, as exports surged while imports fell sharply.
The huge increase in the broadest measure of Japan's external balances, 77
per cent higher than a year ago, looks certain to aggravate an already high
level of friction with Japan's trade partners.
The rising surplus reflects in part the slowdown in Japan's economy, which
reduces demand for imported goods. Weak domestic demand also encourages
manufacturers to reduce stocks by selling them overseas.
The Japanese government will come under increasing international pressure to
stimulate the economy and restore growth in order to reduce its external
surpluses. A package of emergency economic measures announced on Tuesday,
and a 0.75 point cut in the official discount rate to 3.75 per cent
announced on Wednesday, have been widely dismissed as inadequate to revive
the economy.
The Tokyo stock exchange yesterday interrupted its recent slide, with the
the Nikkei average closing 273.68 higher at 18,559.71.
The February trade balance, which excludes invisible trade items such as
tourism and insurance, rose by 74 per cent to Y12.3bn, just short of the
record set in December. Exports rose by 12.5 per cent, led by strong sales
of cars and ships. Imports fell by 12.7 per cent.
The dollar value of the surplus was also boosted by the higher value of the
yen compared to a year ago and by lower commodity prices, especially for
crude oil.
February saw a continuing heavy flow of long-term capital into Japan, with a
net capital surplus of Dollars 1.7bn, compared to Dollars 3.5bn in January.
Foreigners were net purchasers of Japanese equities worth Dollars 2.4bn,
although they turned net sellers of Japanese bonds, worth Dollars 1.2bn.
Japanese continued to be net sellers of foreign equities, worth Dollars 893m
in February. Net Japanese purchases of foreign bonds fell from Dollars 7.4bn
in January to Dollars 1.4bn in February.

FT  04 APR 92 / Chinese congress votes for giant hydro-electric scheme:
Go-ahead for controversial plan for world's biggest reservoir
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Chinese parliament yesterday voted in favour of the controversial Three
Gorges dam on the Yangtze river, the biggest hydro-electric project in the
world, capable of generating one-eighth of all the power now produced in
China.
Over the last 40 years of communist rule numerous research studies into the
feasibility of the dam, first proposed 70 years ago, have been conducted,
but no decision made.
The giant scheme, costed at 57bn yuan (Pounds 8.2bn), has been criticised
inside and outside China on scientific, economic, environmental, social and
even defence grounds. The 600km-longreservoir backed up behind the dam could
be vulnerable to nuclear attack, opponents say.
The most recent feasibility study, completed in November 1988, recommended
building the dam at the eastern end of the Yangtze's famous Three Gorges,
one of the world's scenic wonders. Ten experts refused to sign the report.
The project was denounced in 1988 by Chinese critics as a Stalinist folly.
The vice-chairman of the China Democratic League, one of the country's eight
non-communist political parties, said China could not afford it. Bankers
warned of ballooning cost over the 18 years it would take to build.
The National People's Congress voted 1,767 to 177 in favour of building the
dam, but 664 abstained, the most in memory on any vote.
The benefits of centrally planned flood control and a huge power generating
capacity outweigh the scheme's defects, China's communist leaders argue. But
even the government acknowledges the magnitude of the problems, including
the displacement of more than 1m Chinese whose homes will be flooded.
All kinds of opinions were still welcome even after the project was approved
by the NPC, chairman Wan Li said early this week, anticipating today's
favourable vote while acknowledging dissent.
Dissenters include NPC deputies from Hong Kong and Taiwan and those seeking
to delay the project because of its cost and complex technical problems,
including sedimentation. The Sichuan port city of Chongqing at the western
end of the reservoir could silt up.
Upriver of the dam, Sichuan province bears the brunt of the project's
environmental damage and has 85 per cent of the people to be moved. The
flood-control and power-generating benefits go primarily to the citizens of
downstream Hubei province.
Widespread flooding in eastern and central China last summer, which killed
hundreds of people and cost billions of yuan, gave impetus to the Three
Gorges scheme. The starting date will depend on China's future financial
situation but trial resettlement of people is already under way.
The congress ended its annual session by approving humiliating changes to
hardline premier Li Peng's state-of-the-nation report, in a clear victory
for reformists.
This year's congress took place amid a power struggle between Marxist
conservatives and economic reformers led by 87-year-old paramount leader
Deng Xiaoping.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BRAZILIAN President Fernando Collor's attempts to persuade the Social
Democratic party to join his government have failed, leaving him desperately
seeking allies to fill the holes in his administration left by the
resignation of more than 30 government members.
Initial positive reaction to the reshuffle - the largest in Brazilian
history - has turned to incredulity as Mr Collor proves unable to attract
people or parties to his team. The government's reform programme has been
stalled, along with the investigations into corruption in the administration
which led to its dismissal.
Important ministries such as Infrastructure and Agriculture are paralysed
while Mr Collor dangles the posts in front of potential allies. 'It's
becoming an auction,' commented one congressman yesterday.
With municipal elections due in October, politicians do not want to be
associated with the government's unpopular economic policy, which has
provoked two years of recession.
Stephen Fidler adds from Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic: Hopes that both
Brazil and Argentina could reach agreement in principle with leading
commercial bank creditors in the next week have been dashed as Brazil
suspended further talks with banks for nearly three weeks.
However, Argentina and its bank advisory group are expected to meet in Santo
Domingo at the annual meeting of the Inter-American Development Bank in the
next few days. This leaves open the possibility that Argentina may secure an
outline debt accord under the Brady Plan.
There had been hopes that the IADB meeting would symbolise an end to the
decade-long debt crisis for both countries. But the Brazilian government
baulked at completing a complex deal ahead of what it saw as a false
deadline.

how Nazi and communist legacies dominate German politics

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Manfred Stolpe leaned back on the leather seat of his Mercedes limousine
as it barrelled along the pot-holed roads of east Germany and proclaimed
wistfully: 'Germans have a difficult time with our past.'
The prime minister of the German state of Brandenburg, the place where
Prussia was born, is feeling more than usually haunted by ghosts from recent
and not so recent German history.
For the past three months Mr Stolpe, eastern Germany's only home-grown
politician of note and the only Social Democrat (SPD) heading a state
government there, has been under unrelenting attack for allegedly serving as
an informer for the hated Stasi secret police in the former communist state.
Then a couple of weeks ago an echo from the Nazi past rang through the
Brandenburg parliament when its honorary president, Mr Gustav Just, resigned
after it was revealed he participated in a Wehrmacht execution of six Jews
in the Ukraine after the Nazi invasion.
Now Mr Stolpe's government has been rocked by remarks made by his junior
coalition partner, Mr Peter-Michael Diestel, the local Christian Democrat
parliamentary leader, that appeared to justify the role of Stasi informers
in East Germany as having been 'guarantors of social peace'.
Mr Diestel's comments have shocked Chancellor Helmut Kohl, as his CDU party
prepares for tomorrow's crucial regional elections in the western German
Lander (states) of Baden-Wurttemberg and Schleswig-Holstein.
In the eastern parts of the unified Germany, these two different, but still
not-quite-conquered German pasts have become the principal weapons of
political combat. They are also a focus for economic and social resentment
against the west.
Mr Stolpe, a modest man with a homespun air, has become philosophical about
the trend, just as he is resigned to the probings of a parliamentary
commission into his own case . 'We'll have a lot more of this political
turbulence over the next couple of years,' he says.
The Brandenburg premier has made no bones about his contacts with the secret
police. As a senior lay official of the Protestant church, he interceded
with the communist regime in humanitarian cases over a period of decades,
obtaining the release of thousands of East German prisoners and reuniting
families in the west. To do so, he insists, he had to negotiate with the
Stasi and thus inadvertently came to be registered as an accomplice.
'The east Germans have a tendency to think as Germans did in 1945,' says Mr
Stolpe. 'They are looking for scapegoats. Some people tell me it's a
conscious effort at humiliating the east Germans by the west Germans, who
have yet to come to terms with the Nazi past.'
Whatever the intention, that is turning out to be the effect. Mr Kohl, who
had been suspected by some of seeking to turn Mr Stolpe's misfortunes
against the SPD at large, has seen the affair blow up in his face after Mr
Diestel's remarks. The result, according to many East Germans, is dissension
between ordinary 'Ossis' and 'Wessis' greater than before the wall came
down. 'The process of growing together again will take years,' says Mr
Stolpe. 'The decisive thing will be whether we can create the economic and
social conditions where people won't have the feeling that they're losers.'
The current disastrous state of the east German economy means such
conditions are likely to be absent for a good while. The effective jobless
rate in the five eastern Lander of the federal republic is between 30 and 40
per cent - even in Brandenburg, one of the least poor, it is 30 per cent.
What is more, Mr Stolpe admits that with wages ratcheting sharply upwards -
to 80 per cent of the west German level in some sectors - many more jobs
will go.
Although the economy has lifted somewhat after its near total collapse last
year, self-sustaining improvement is hard to discern, despite an infusion of
government funds estimated at DM180bn (Pounds 63bn) this year.
The danger, as the Brandenburg premier has often warned, is that over time
this will lead to political radicalisation. The tools which extremists could
use are already to hand. Says Mr Stolpe as he prepares to board a flight to
campaign for his party in Baden-Wurttemberg: 'We Germans are a mad people.'
The German government yesterday moved to clear the legal log-jam blocking
investment in the former GDR, writes Christopher Parkes.
All claims from former owners of businesses, houses, land and other
properties, including Jews dispossessed before the war, must be registered
before the end of this year, Mr Klaus Kinkel, justice minister, announced in
Bonn.
Former owners demanding the return of businesses must also present new
business plans within four weeks of registering their claims.
Unveiling a draft legal amendment, he said he had 'gone as far as
constitutionally possible' in his efforts to speed the clearing up over 1m
property disputes caused by 40 years of communist mismanagement and Nazi
appropriations.

<TEXT>
PEUGEOT, the French car maker, has reached agreement with FS Lublin
(formerly Fabryka Samochodow Ciezarowych), a Polish light commercial vehicle
producer, for the small-volume assembly of Peugeot cars in Poland.
Peugeot has signed an industrial co-operation deal with the Lublin-based van
maker, for the local assembly of the Peugeot 405 large family car.
Production in Lublin is to begin in May next year. Output is planned to
reach 2,000 in the first year, rising to 10,000 in the fourth year.
Local content is expected to begin at 20 per cent, but should rise quickly
to around 50 per cent. Peugeot says this expansion of capacity and local
content would involve an eventual investment of more than FFr350m (Pounds
36m).
FS Lublin has a workforce of 7,200 and derives around half of its turnover
from the supplying of components to other Polish vehicle makers.

FT  04 APR 92 / Safer European reactors sought
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPEAN Community governments must take urgent joint action to improve the
safety of eastern Europe's ailing nuclear reactors, the head of France's
atomic energy commission warned yesterday.
It will cost around FFr64bn (Pounds 6.6bn) to bring reactors in eastern
Europe and the former Soviet Union to an acceptable level of safety and to
close those beyond redemption, said Mr Philippe Rouvillois, chairman of the
Commissariat a l'Energie Atomique.
'We do not have the right to leave these countries alone to face these
problems which they cannot resolve themselves,' Mr Rouvillois told the
Kangaroo Group, an organisation of European MPs devoted to promoting the
European single market. The community and other international bodies must
provide financial help and technical advice fast, he urged.
His remarks reflect growing European concern at the risk of a repeat of the
1986 Chernobyl disaster, following last month's radiation leak at a reactor
near St Petersburg.
Germany wants to discuss nuclear safety in the east at the July summit of
the Group of Seven industrial countries, and France has sent technology
advisers to the region.
Apart from the environmental risk, western governments would have political
difficulties in maintaining their own nuclear programmes if there were
another serious accident in the east, Mr Rouvillois added. This is
especially important to France as the world's most nuclear-dependent
country: it draws three-quarters of its electricity from nuclear power.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Ramiz Alia, the last of Albania's Stalinist stalwarts, resigned
from office yesterday after a landslide election victory for the
anti-communist Democratic party 12 days ago, Reuter reports from Tirana.
Mr Alia, 67, announced his decision on Albanian state radio.
The hand-picked successor to the late dictator Mr Enver Hoxha, who died in
1985, said he would formally present his resignation to parliament today at
its first session since the March 22 election.
The Democrats won over 60 per cent of the vote, while the communists,
renamed the Socialist party, took less than 30 per cent.
Mr Alia said he had made his decision after consultations with the
Democratic party leader, Mr Sali Berisha, and the head of the Socialists, Mr
Fatos Nano.
It was not clear whether Mr Berisha, a charismatic 47-year-old heart
surgeon, would step into Mr Alia's post or become the country's prime
minister. Under the constitution, Albania's president is chosen by
parliament.
It was Mr Alia who, bowing - albeit late - to a wave of anti-communist
sentiment sweeping eastern Europe, decided in December 1990 to permit
multi-party elections in Albania.
In his statement, he said he had accepted the post of president a year ago
to help keep the country united, avoid serious disruptions and lead Albania
towards democracy.
'I am offering my resignation for the same reasons,' he said.
The Democrats greeted his resignation with satisfaction.

FT  04 APR 92 / Hopes for farm trade reform deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID DODWELL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Jurgen Mollemann, Germany's economics minister, expressed hopes yesterday
that the change in government in Paris will open the way to decisions in
France 'that allow the European Community to come to a compromise with the
US government' on farm trade reforms.
Speaking at a conference in Paris, Mr Mollemann said it would be 'a
catastrophe' if the Uruguay Round of talks on liberalisation of world trade
were to fail because of deadlock over agriculture.
Negotiations began in 1986, but have been paralysed since the end of 1990 by
EC refusal to accept these reforms. France has been the most reluctant to
compromise, particularly on US demands for cuts in the volume of subsidised
farm exports.
The German minister pointed to a summit in Washington between President
George Bush and EC President Jacques Delors on April 22 as an opportunity
for compromise.
Commenting on the appointment on Thursday of a new French government headed
by Mr Pierre Beregovoy, Mr Mollemann noted that Mr Beregovoy 'has a very
high understanding of the international economic problems we are facing'.
At the same conference, Mr Frans Andriessen, vice-president of the EC,
talked of Mr Beregovoy as a 'very EC-oriented man'.
'It seems trivial that such an enormously important exercise (as the Uruguay
Round) is depending on farm trade. We should accept the challenge to make
reform.'
Mr Mollemann called for a special Group of Seven summit to resolve the trade
deadlock if no compromise was reached in Washington in April.

</HEADLINE>

   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GERMAN unemployment has fallen sharply and industrial production in the west
increased, government officials reported yesterday. However, the federal
labour office warned of 'considerable' job losses to come in the east, and
Economics Ministry figures showed most output growth came from construction.
The 166,000 drop in the March jobless total was relatively evenly balanced
between both parts of the country. A net reduction of 70,200 in the east
brought down the number officially without a job to 1.2m - 15 per cent of
the work force.
However, Mr Heinrich Franke, head of the labour office, said the decline did
not reflect any change in real conditions in the eastern labour market.
Numbers had declined mainly because of the extension of government-funded
labour market support measures. Around 120,000 people formerly registered as
jobless, had been given places in work creation schemes or had taken early
retirement.
In the west there were 1.77m out of work or 5.8 per cent of the workforce.
The fall was due mainly to exceptionally mild winter weather.
The weather also contributed to a 22 per cent west German building output in
January and February. This helped industrial output for the two months to a
1.8 per cent rise.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A STEEP decline in car sales in March was reported yesterday by the Japan
Automobile Dealers' Association (Jada), adding to the accumulating evidence
that Japan's economy is slowing sharply.
March sales fell by 6.5 per cent compared to a year ago to 694,520 units,
Jada said in a preliminary report. For the first three months of the year,
sales were down by 4.3 per cent.
The Jada report nonetheless contained one slice of good news for the
industry. Sales of larger cars with engines of more than two litres, which
are more expensive and profitable, rose by 40.8 per cent to 86,632 units in
March. Small cars (excluding minicars) were hit hardest, with sales down 15
per cent to 404,954 units.
Meanwhile, a report by the Economic Planning Agency issued yesterday showed
that plant and equipment investment by Japanese companies was expected to
rise by an average of 4.6 per cent in the next three years, compared to an
average rise of 10.6 per cent over the past three years.
A main reason for the decline was the difficulty companies have raising
funds on the depressed stock market, according to a survey of companies.
The EPA report also said that investment in labour saving equipment and
spending on research and development were affected by interest rate
movements. Many analysts had assumed that these areas of investment were
relatively unaffected by financial market trends.

THE former main owner of the parent company of Swedish arms maker AB Bofors
denied yesterday that the company had paid bribes to win a Dollars 1.3bn
weapons order from India in 1986, Reuter reports from Stockholm.
'Nobel Industrier (Bofors's parent company) has not paid any bribes to
Indian civil servants, nor politicians nor military,' Mr Erik Penser told a
news conference. Nobel and Bofors had previously denied the charges, but
yesterday's comment was the first time the reclusive financier had held a
news conference.
The scandal, which first surfaced in 1987, made headlines again on Tuesday
when Mr Madhavsinh Solanki, the Indian foreign minister, resigned over
charges that he had tried to cover up investigations into bribes made during
the deal.
India's prime minister at the time of the scandal, the late Mr Rajiv Gandhi,
denied wrongdoing but the scandal was a factor in the defeat of his Congress
party in 1989 elections.
Mr Penser lost control of Nobel last year after his 66 per cent stake was
seized by Nordbanken as collateral for loans.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
INTELSAT, the international telecommunications consortium, has for the first
time in its 29 years granted a contract to China Great Wall Industry
Corporation for the launch of an Intelsat satellite in 1995-96.
The contract - for the first model of a new Long March series - is
contingent on the receipt of a US export licence. The US state department,
which has authority over such export licences, has granted permission in the
past for export of two Hughes satellites, launched by Great Wall, for
Asiasat and Aussat, two regional systems.
However, each licence application has to be considered separately, and
approval will depend on the technology embedded in the satellite, a state
department official said.
Mr Tony Trujillo, a spokesman for Intelsat, said the contract to China Great
Wall is part of a broader plan by the new director general, Mr Irving
Goldstein, to stress price saving and efficiency within the organisation to
prepare for competitive threats posed by fibre optic cable and separate
satellite systems.
Great Wall is selling its service for an (unspecified) 'competitive' price,
and Intelsat wants to diversify its launch suppliers, Mr Trujillo said.
The Intelsat board has also endorsed the introduction of medium-term and
long-term debt into Intelsat's capital structure in order to reduce the
average cost of capital.
Mr Goldstein said in an interview that he is now preparing for the 'first
foray' into the international capital markets.
'It's another part of our culture change,' he said. 'Instead of being 100
per cent equity-financed we will move toward a Eurobond offering in the
third quarter of 1992.'
Intelsat's basic telephonic service will grow 'only modestly' on the high
density routes connecting industrialised countries, he said. Its main growth
for telephone services will be in eastern Europe and third world markets.

FT  03 APR 92 / London Stock Exchange: Heavy turnover in BP
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN, JOEL KIBAZO, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and COLIN MILLHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TURNOVER in BP surged to 54m shares as a block of 14.2m failed to find a
home in the UK and eventually reached more enthusiastic US investors.
It is believed that a large institution decided to sell the shares through
County NatWest. The securities house was said to have tried unsuccessfully
to place them with other UK institutions at around 241p. Salomon Brothers
was then said to have bought them at around that level to sell on to US
institutions. In the past month, the US holding in BP is thought to have
risen from 8 per cent to 10 per cent.
The overhang of shares in the market and continuing worries over
first-quarter profits, as well as the dividend, knocked BP back 6p at one
stage, a substantial fall for the stock. Once the deals were out of the way
the shares rallied to close a net 3 down at 246p.
Vodafone in demand
Cellular network operator Vodafone Group ended its recent dismal run as a
number of brokers decided that the shares looked cheap. UBS Phillips &amp; Drew,
the house broker, reiterated its buy stance as figures for March showed new
connection rates at their highest since October 1990.
Henderson Crosthwaite, the agency broker, moved from a sell to a buy,
analyst Mr Brian Newman describing the figures as 'the first signs of
recovery in demand from new cellular subscribers'. Mr Tim Hirst at Lehman
Brothers pointed to the fact that Vodafone was approaching its all-time
price/earnings relative low, and was well positioned for economic recovery.
The shares improved 4 1/2 to 314 1/2 p in busy turnover of 4.7m.
Rubbish had an influence on the water companies yesterday, with one
depressed by its waste disposal activities while two others gained support,
in a sector remaining vulnerable to political developments.
Severn Trent slipped 9 to 301p as County NatWest lowered its forecast of
profits to March 1992 by Pounds 7m to Pounds 263m and for the next financial
year by Pounds 8m to Pounds 270m on the poor performance of Biffa, Severn's
waste disposal subsidiary acquired from BET last year.
South West Water picked up 2 to 337p on news that it is to form a joint
venture company with a leading Spanish waste management concern. The 50-50
owned company will be known as Peninsula Waste Management.
Wessex Water firmed a penny to 384p. The company is involved in a British
joint venture with US-based Waste Management International. The latter is
floating 75m shares next week, 20 per cent of its enlarged capital, mainly
in London and New York.
Revived bid speculation, and the announcement that a chief executive had
been appointed, helped Fisons, which bucked the market to end 8 up at 334p.
The Fisons bid talk, which has featured for some time, focused yesterday on
Medeva, the fast-growing group headed by former Glaxo chief executive Mr
Bernard Taylor. Medeva fell 10 to 251p.
In terms of the appointment, Mr Cedric Scroggs was not the market's first
choice, but any disappointment was already in the Fisons share price and
observers were relieved at the ending of uncertainty.
Continuing forecast downgrades affected ICI, finally 15 lower at 1224p.
Good advances for the UK's two biggest insurance brokers, Sedgwick (up 10 at
214p) and Willis Corroon (9 ahead at 242p), reflected recent dollar strength
and hopes of premium increases.
Insurer Sun Alliance was buoyed in early trading by relief that the
underlying annual figures were not worse. The group announced a Pounds 466m
loss, at the lower end of market estimates. However, it also came out with a
positive statement and a stronger than expected balance sheet. Agency broker
James Capel reduced its 1992 loss forecast by Pounds 50m to Pounds 100m. Sun
closed unchanged at 250p.
There were few surprises in Redland's results, but the market was pleased
that there were no black holes and the integration with Steetley could now
proceed. Redland moved ahead 17 to 467p in heavy volume of 5m shares.
Activity in the hotels sector centred once again on Queens Moat Houses, in
which 7.1m shares were traded after Tuesday's 7m. Mercury Asset Management
was believed to be the big seller yesterday, with Kleinwort Benson reported
to have placed the stock with institutions. The shares eased a penny to 75
1/2 p.
Forte was weak, as one house found itself caught with some 2m shares on its
books as rival marketmakers turned sellers. The stock lost 4 to 222p on
turnover of 2.2m.
Hoare Govett reiterated its buy stance on Granada Group and upgraded its
1992 profits forecast by Pounds 3m to Pounds 114m and 1993 by Pounds 6m to
Pounds 136m on optimism over the group's business services division. The
stock gained 4 to 228p.
Packaging and printing group Bowater dropped 26 to 701p as investors sold
their nil-paid rights. The nil-paid retreated 29 to 76p.
The prospect of troubled conglomerate Lonrho being taken private continued
to boost the shares, which regained a further 8 to 79p.
Talk surrounding BET of a placing of 2m shares and another profits downgrade
 -recently analysts shifted their estimates towards the Pounds 100m mark -
left the stock 4 lower at 121p on exceptionally heavy turnover of 11m.
A large seller of new FT-SE 100 constituent Siebe depressed the shares 19 to
618p.
Rolls-Royce rose 5 to 154p, boosted by news of engine orders from Thai
Airways to power two more Boeing 777 airliners. British Aerospace put on 5
to 300p, lifted by Wednesday's news of an agreement between the US and
European Commission over air subsidies.
Submarine builder VSEL tumbled 30 to 270p as dealers came to the view that a
Labour government would not order a fourth Trident submarine.
Simon Engineering fell 8 to 244p over fears of payment difficulties for work
the company has carried out in Armenia.
Suggestions that one marketmaker had been left holding unwanted Tate &amp; Lyle
shares pulled the stock down to 393p in early trading, but the price rallied
to 398p to leave a decline of only 2 on the day.
Associated Fisheries receded 8 to 108p on reporting profits down to Pounds
1m from Pounds 3.4m and a provision of Pounds 5.5m for losses involving
Macfish, its joint venture with Geest. Unilever advanced 11 to 907p on a buy
recommendation from SG Warburg and the sale of its animal feed business to
Harrisons &amp; Crosfield.

FT  03 APR 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures and Options Trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
REPORTS of a Gallup opinion poll indicating a Labour party lead in the
general election led to a weak closing in stock index futures, although
turnover was again high following a volatile session, writes Joel Kibazo.
The June contract on the FT-SE started the session strongly, up 11 at 2,455,
after Wednesday's opinion polls once again pointed to the prospect of a hung
parliament. But dealers said there was no follow-through buying after the
initial spurt and June was 'sold off aggressively', falling to 2,425 by
mid-morning.
A rally was seen in the contract during the afternoon session following a
firm Wall Street start, but talk about the latest opinion poll triggered
selling by independent traders, sending June south once again to a weak
close.
June ended at 2,427, down 19 from the previous session and around 6 points
above its estimated fair value premium to cash of about 28. Turnover at
6,352 lots was again healthy.
In traded options, volume reached 33,297 contracts by the close. The FT-SE
option once again took centre stage, trading a day's total of 15,012. The
Euro FT-SE had 2,096 lots dealt. Activity in stock options was again poor,
although better than on Wednesday.

FT  03 APR 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equities easier after volatile
session
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A RELATIVELY steady perf-ormance by sterling and modest gains in gilt-edged
stocks helped to underpin a fragile equity market still liable to lurch
sharply in either direction in response to opinion polls.
At the close, the FT-SE 100 Index settled 3.2 off at 2,405.4, having swung
from positive to negative territory during another active trading session
dominated by a further batch of big placings and a flurry of small programme
trades.
Dealers were encouraged by the level of activity in the market which,
although less than on Wednesday, when volume was the highest so far this
year, remained well above average daily levels during the first quarter.
Turnover yesterday amounted to 607.2m shares, compared with the previous
day's 701.6m, and was boosted considerably by sizeable placings of shares in
BP and BET.
There was also evidence, according to traders, of exceptionally large
selling pressure related to end of the tax year considerations.
Dealers also mentioned talk of hefty 'bed and breakfast' activity, selling
of 'Peps' and suggestions of sizeable selling by company directors linked to
worries about the increased possibility of a Labour victory in next
Thursday's general election.
At the outset of trading, marketmakers, relieved that the latest opinion
polls indicated a much tighter outcome than the polls of the previous
session, hoisted their opening levels and drew in 'cheap' buyers, pushing
the Footsie up to the day's peak of 2,424.1 within minutes of the opening.
But mid-morning saw several large blocks of shares come on offer. These
tended to cause temporary disruption in the market, as did the programme
trades.
Turnover tended to fall away during the afternoon, in spite of hints that an
opinion poll published today would show Labour leading the Conservatives by
four points. The Footsie drifted off to post a 14.5 net decline before
stabilising and ending marginally down on balance. The late rally was
stimulated by Wall Street.
A host of individual features emerged from the market. Fisons, the
pharmaceuticals/ chemicals group, moved sharply higher following the
appointment of a new chief executive and the re-emergence of stories that
Medeva, the fast-expanding pharmaceuticals concern, may be preparing a bid
for the company.
Vodafone shares gave a ready response to a handful of buy recommendations,
notably from Henderson Crosthwaite and Lehman Brothers, highlighting the
first signs of a pick-up in new subscribers for cellular radios. Redland's
results were also given a warm welcome by the market.
Equity strategists remained extremely cautious on the short-term outlook for
the market. Kleinwort Benson's strategy team, in their April Market Outlook,
said that either an outright Tory or Labour win, along with a recovery in
the US economy and an upturn in UK earnings, should push the Footsie into
new high ground by the end of the year.
Election worries produced more strong support for big overseas earners such
as Reuters, RTZ and BAT Industries.

FT  03 APR 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow declines as jobs data is
awaited

<TEXT>
Wall Street
TRADING on US stock markets remained subdued yesterday ahead of a key
employment report, and share prices finished lower across the board
following another big fall in Japanese equities overnight, writes Patrick
Harverson in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended 15.21 down at 3,234.12, while the
Standard &amp; Poor's 500 declined 3.73 to 400.50. The Nasdaq composite index of
over-the-counter stocks fell 8.27 to 593.82. Turnover on the New York SE
totalled a modest 185m shares.
US markets are concerned about the sharp falls on the Tokyo Stock Exchange
because they fear this will force Japanese investors to repatriate funds,
which could mean withdrawing money from US stock and bond markets.
Domestic economic factors also weighed heavily on investors. Today's March
jobs data should help clear some of the uncertainty surrounding the US
economy, and analysts are forecasting a rise in those in work, which would
confirm the recent trend of a gradual improvement in labour conditions.
The big three motor stocks were in mixed form, in spite of hopes among some
investors that car sales will rebound in line with the economic recovery.
Ford put on Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 39 1/2 . Chrysler lost Dollars  3/8 to
Dollars 17 1/2 and General Motors Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 36 1/2 .
CMS Energy plunged Dollars 6 to Dollars 15 3/4 in turnover of 3.3m shares
after the Michigan Public Service Commission turned down a proposal by the
company to settle various rate issues that are pending.
CUC International rose Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 33 3/8 after broking house
Alex Brown raised its rating on the electronic shopping service group from
'hold' to 'buy'.
On the over-the-counter market, Immunex plummeted Dollars 10 1/2 to Dollars
31 1/2 after the company said it expected to post a first-quarter loss. The
market had been expecting profits of about 9 cents a share in the quarter.
Goal Systems jumped Dollars 3 1/2 to Dollars 18 3/4 in heavy trading after
it was announced that the developer of IBM-compatible software will be
bought by another software group, Legent, for Dollars 400m in stock. Under
the deal, each share of Goal will be swapped for just over half a Legent
share. Legent dropped Dollars 4 1/4 to Dollars 36 1/2 .
Canada
TORONTO followed Wall Street's downtrend during fairly heavy trading, the
composite index finishing 16.0 lower at 3,395.9. Falls outnumbered advances
by 320 to 231 after volume of 33.2m shares.
Corel Systems, off CDollars 1 7/8 at CDollars 17 1/8 , reported
first-quarter earnings from continuing operations of CDollars 1.97m or 17
cents a share, down from CDollars 2.8m or 26 cents a year ago.

FT  03 APR 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar awaits crucial figures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DOLLAR dropped by more than a pfennig in an uncertain market as dealers
trimmed long positions and adopted a defensive stance before today's crucial
US jobs data, writes Neil Buckley.
Dollar optimism was dented yesterday by disappointing weekly jobless claims
figures showing a rise of 9,000 to 456,000, compared with an expected slight
fall. However, factory orders rose 0.5 per cent, slightly above
expectations.
Dealers are looking for today's March non-farm payroll figures to provide
further evidence that a US economic recovery is really under way and will
not falter as it did last year. They said a strong figure could propel the
dollar through resistance at DM1.6625 towards DM1.67, and possibly through
the Y135 barrier.
Most estimates are of an increase of between 20,000 to 70,000, with the
average at around 45,000, although some analysts are more cautious. Mr
Steven Barrow, treasury adviser at Chemical Bank, said: 'There is certainly
a lot of pessimism around and everyone is concentrating on what could go
wrong with the figures.'
The dollar drifted to DM1.6450 and Y133.90 at the close, having reached
highs of DM1.6591 and Y134.98 in the morning. These early tests of upside
resistance were fuelled by another weak performance by Japanese stocks, with
the Nikkei index dropping 1.59 per cent, after a 3.95 per cent slide on
Wednesday. Yesterday in New York the US unit ended at DM1.6437/44 and
Y133.70/75.
However, unfounded rumours that the Bundesbank might be about to raise
interest rates injected a note of caution into the market, which persisted
even when German rates remained unchanged.
In Tokyo, the dollar had also fallen back after an early surge, closing at
DM 1.6567 and Y134.77 after New York closes of DM1.6508/18 and Y134.50/60 on
Wednesday.
The French franc climbed to a nine-month high against the D-Mark after Mr
Pierre Beregovoy, finance minister, replaced Mrs Edith Cresson as prime
minister - a move warmly welcomed by the markets. Mr Beregovoy is respected
for his tough monetary stance and promotion of a stable franc.
The D-Mark opened at FFr3.3910 and later declined to FFr3.3870/73 in lively
trading.
Sterling fell towards the close, although dealers said this was mainly
because it had come under pressure on the cross as the dollar lost ground
against the D-Mark, rather than because of any inherent weakness. Two UK
opinion polls contradicting the decisive lead given to the opposition Labour
party by three polls on Wednesday had earlier lifted sterling sentiment. It
ended at DM2.8451/85 after Wednesday's DM2.8493/8528 close.
Against the dollar, sterling rose to Dollars 1.7300 from Dollars 1.7240, and
in New York to Dollars 1.7308.

FT  03 APR 92 / Government Bonds: Tokyo takes fright as economic message
comes home
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON, RICHARD WATERS and SIMON LONDON

<DATELINE>

THE Japanese government bond market caught a fright yesterday. The tumbling
Tokyo stock market and a weakening yen finally brought home the message the
market had been struggling to digest the day before: that this week's fiscal
package and cut in the official discount rate are unlikely to make much
difference to the worsening Japanese economy.
The result was a heavy sell-off in the government bond market in the
afternoon as rumours of heavy selling sent waves of panic through the
market. By the close, the market had recovered some of the lost ground, but
was still looking badly battered, with bonds at yields around their highest
for the year so far.
'There's not a lot of news - there's just rumour and panic,' one trader
said. 'The market is in a state of confusion and shock.'
The benchmark bond 129 tumbled during the day, with the yield jumping
sharply from 5.42 per cent at the opening to 5.71 per cent at one stage as
panic set in. A later recovery brought it back to close around 5.5 per cent,
though the price continued to slide during the London trading day, with the
yield rising to 5.55 per cent.
The gloom over the yen and the state of the stock market suggest further
falls are in store. Mr Neil McKinnon, an economist with Yamaichi in London,
said yields were likely to rise to 6 per cent by the summer, while further
interest rate cuts to support the equity market would take the official
discount rate down to 3 per cent.
THE FRENCH government bond market got what it wanted yesterday - and
promptly reacted with a sharp bout of selling. Mrs Edith Cresson's
resignation as prime minister, and her replacement by Mr Pierre Beregovoy,
were just what traders had been hoping for.
The French bond futures contract closed down 0.08 at 107.26. Cash bonds were
left once more yielding around 72 basis points more than their German
equivalents, in part due to a quiet day for the bund market. (While the
German cash market remained steady, trading in a narrow range, bund futures
gained on the day, closing up at 87.21 after opening at 87.06.)
Where the French market goes from here depends in part on who will succeed
Mr Beregovoy at the finance ministry. Although there is a feeling in some
quarters that the prime minister will double up as finance minister, a more
expected move would be that of Mr Jacques de Larosiere, the governor of the
Bank of France. That would be a popular choice with the market.
FOREIGN investors have rediscovered some appetite for Italian bonds this
week. The latest auction of 10-year bonds on Tuesday saw strong foreign
buying, according to several bankers - in part to square short positions in
the futures market.
With political uncertainty over this weekend's elections, and little cheer
on the economic front, Italian government bonds have lost ground in the last
fortnight. They had tightened by around 0.5 percentage point against bunds
during the year so far, reaching a spread of 2.9 per cent, before falling
again to 3.2 per cent. This week's buying interest and a relaxed monetary
stance yesterday, have helped to bring back a firmer tone to the market.
US TREASURY prices fell slightly at both ends of the yield curve yesterday
as traders and investors continued to tread gently ahead of today's
important jobs report for March.
In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was down  7/32 at 100
15/16 , yielding 7.911 per cent. The short end was also weaker, with the
two-year note down  1/32 at 100 13/32 , yielding 5.515 per cent.
The only economic news of the day - initial jobless claims up 9,000 in the
third week of March and a 0.5 per cent rise in February factory orders - had
no effect on sentiment because the market had its eyes firmly fixed on
today's employment data. The forecast is for a rise in non-farm payrolls of
between 45,000 and 70,000, which would represent a continuation of the trend
for a modest improvement in labour conditions.
AFTER losing its nerve on Wednesday over fears of an imminent change of
government, the UK government bond market yesterday regained some of its
composure. Traders gathered enough confidence to mark bond prices up
slightly on the day. The benchmark 9 per cent maturing in 2011 gained nearly
 1/4 point on the day, closing up at 94 1/32 , a yield of 9.68 per cent.
THE UK government bond market was the worst performing market last month in
both sterling and dollar terms, according to figures supplied by JP Morgan
and Kemper Investment Management, writes Simon London.
A portfolio of gilts gave sterling-based investors a negative return of
about 2.5 per cent over the month, as pre-election jitters sent bond prices
lower. For an international US dollar-based investor, the outcome was worse
still: a negative return of over 3.5 per cent.

GENERAL MOTORS, the US automotive manufacturer in the throes of a large
restructuring, yesterday announced that it was looking for a buyer for its
Allison Gas Turbine Division.
Allison, which employs some 6,300 people, designs and makes turbine engines
for the aerospace, industrial and marine industries. GM bought the business
in 1929. It has manufacturing and research facilities in Indianapolis,
Indiana.
Mr William Hoglund, GM's executive vice-president in charge of Allison, said
the sale was consistent with the company's strategy of focusing its energy
on improving the competitive position of its core businesses.
Last December GM announced plans for more than 70,000 jobs losses and the
closure of 21 plants over the next few years to return its heavily
loss-making US automotive operations to profit.
In recent years the group has spun off several large peripheral activities,
notably Detroit Diesel, which under new management turned from a loss-maker
into a profitable, entrepreneurial business.
Mr Blake Wallace, general manager of Allison, yesterday sought to reassure
customers - many of them foreign governments - that it would keep its
operations stable during the transition from GM ownership.

<TEXT>
OLYMPIA &amp; YORK is expected to ask its banks for a formal suspension of
repayments on its debt, which exceeds Dollars 20bn, to provide time for an
agreement to be reached on a permanent reorganisation of borrowings.
However, O&amp;Y has been forced to postpone a meeting of all its banks which
had been scheduled for Monday.
The task of condensing information on all its borrowings, provided by more
than 100 banks, proved too great in the time. O&amp;Y said yesterday that it now
plans to hold the meeting on April 13. The company said in a statement that
it will put forward an interim proposal at the meeting while it negotiates a
longer-term plan. In addition, it plans to provide detailed information
about what it described as its 'legal and organisation structures', and its
financial condition.
Last week, O&amp;Y was given an informal promise by 20 banks with the biggest
loans to it that they would suspend debt repayments in advance of a meeting
of all the banks.
A complete reorganisation of O&amp;Y's debt is expected to take two years. O&amp;Y
hopes its banks will suspend principal repayments until the reorganisation
is completed. A steering committee of O&amp;Y's banks is being led by Citicorp,
Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce and the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking
Corporation.
One item on the agenda at the full bank meeting is likely to be a request
for funds to allow work to continue at the Canary Wharf development in
London's Docklands.

FT  03 APR 92 / International Company News: Berlitz turns in loss of Dollars
189.5m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN FRIEDMAN

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BERLITZ, the language school subsidiary of Maxwell Communication Corporation
(MCC), last night unveiled a Dollars 189.5m loss for the fourth quarter of
1991 following Dollars 195.4m of write-offs and special charges created as a
result of MCC's filing for protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of US
bankruptcy law.
The partial cause of the write-offs was the default of MCC on certain
payments due to Berlitz.
Berlitz - which in February hired the Wall Street stockbroking firm of
Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette to advise on the possible sale or
recapitalisation of the company - discovered last year that the late Mr
Robert Maxwell had improperly pledged most of MCC's 56.5 per cent Berlitz
equity stake as collateral for bank loans.
MCC, which filed for bankruptcy protection last year, is itself being
managed in a complex arrangement that requires co-ordination between New
York and UK court-appointed administrators of the Maxwell empire.
At present, most of MCC's 56.5 per cent Berlitz stake is in the hands of
five US and European banks and companies. Injunctions have been brought by
Macmillan, the MCC publisher, to prevent the Berlitz stock from being sold.
Yesterday, Berlitz said its fourth quarter 1991 revenues had declined to
Dollars 66.5m from Dollars 73.4m in the last three months of 1990. The
company disclosed a Dollars 9.97 per share loss in the quarter, compared
with a profit of 12 cents a share in the final quarter of 1990.
For the whole of 1991, Berlitz suffered a loss of Dollars 181.2m or Dollars
9.53 a share, compared with a net profit of Dollars 10.6m, or 56 cents, in
1990.
Berlitz said it expected the write-offs and reserves - made against certain
notes receivable from MCC and affiliates - would generate tax benefits in
future. The default by MCC meant Berlitz is no longer required to pay
dividends on preferred stock held by an MCC affiliate, the company said.

<TEXT>
SPECULATION over a natural gas find in Indonesia has pushed up the market
value of one of the companies for which Olympia &amp; York, the debt-burdened
property developer, is seeking a buyer, writes Bernard Simon in Toronto.
The share price of Gulf Canada Resources, a large oil and gas producer, that
is 75 per cent owned by O&amp;Y, has risen by more than 80 per cent in the past
week.
This is attributed mainly to Gulf's announcement last Monday that its
wholly-owned subsidiary, Asamera Oil, has discovered what it described as a
gas zone 'of significant thickness' on the Indonesian island of Sumatra.
The jump in the share price has lifted Gulf's market capitalisation in the
past week from CDollars 724m (USDollars 608.4m) to more than CDollars 1.3bn.
Gulf's shares stood at CDollars 8.25 in early trading on the Toronto stock
exchange yesterday.
Gulf cautioned that initial data from its exploratory well has yet to be
confirmed by more detailed tests. However, the preliminary findings have
prompted speculation that the gas field could be as big as the nearby Arun
field, which is a large supplier of liquefied natural gas to Japan.
Asamera has a 50 per cent equity interest in the area being drilled.
The remainder is owned by Aceh Gas and Oil of Japan. Asamera's discovery has
also pushed up the share price of Encor, another Calgary oil and gas
producer, which has a 22.5 per cent interest in an exploration block in the
Malacca Strait of Sumatra.
O&amp;Y, which is owned by Canada's Reichmann family, has been seeking a buyer
for Gulf as part of efforts to raise cash to service its debt. But Mr Bill
Magee, analyst at Research Capital in Toronto, said yesterday that neither
buyers nor sellers are likely to commit themselves until there is greater
certainty about the Sumatra discovery's value.
Another O&amp;Y subsidiary, GW Utilities, said yesterday that it has bought for
a discounted price the proceeds of a special dividend which it is due to pay
on April 14 to another company controlled by the Reichmann family.

it to cut its shareholding in Dresdner Bank, Germany's second biggest bank.
The Munich-based insurer said the Berlin authorities' objections to the
shareholding in the bank - and to its business relations with the bank  -
were without foundation.
The cartel office delivered its detailed objections to Allianz and Dresdner
 -two of Germany's most powerful institutions - on Tuesday night. These were
the conclusions of a study started last summer when it emerged that Allianz
had taken its stake in the bank to more than 22 per cent, up from a hitherto
disclosed 10 per cent.
The authorities have made two specific objections to Allianz's relations
with Dresdner. They want Allianz to cut its direct holding in the bank from
22.3 to 19.1 per cent, and they do not want it to proceed with plans to
establish a joint marketing strategy in Germany's new Bundeslander. Ideally
the authorities would like the agreement in the west to be unscrambled as
well.
Berlin wants the stake cut to 19.1 per cent as it believes that only at this
level will Allianz stop having considerable influence over the bank's
commercial strategy.

<TEXT>
MR Rene Jaggi, the Swiss-born judo expert who intends to step down as head
of the Adidas sports shoe and clothing group at the end of this year, has
been approached by Hugo Boss, the mens' fashion company, about becoming its
chief executive.
A decision by the supervisory board of Boss, of which the Marzotto group of
Italy acquired majority control from the privately-owned Leyton House
company of Japan late last year, is expected in a few weeks. Other
candidates have also been approached.
When announcing his decision to leave German-based Adidas - controlled by Mr
Bernard Tapie, the French financier - the extrovert Mr Jaggi, 43, whose
background is in marketing, cited personal reasons.
Adidas is now making increased profits after several years of difficulty
caused mainly by tougher competition in the US from Nike and Reebok.
Mr Jaggi, who is Swiss, has held talks with Mr Joachim Semmler, who chairs
the supervisory board of Boss.
The company is run by brothers Uwe and Jochen Holy, who have contracts until
1994 but have said they would leave earlier if necessary.
Since no successor has yet been found at Adidas, Mr Jaggi is unlikely to
take up any job at Boss until the year is out.
Although a much smaller company than Adidas, which has turnover of nearly
DM5bn (Dollars 3bn), including licence revenues, Boss has an international
reputation for its stylish clothes and has developed a powerful marketing
image. Its annual sales are around DM900m.

FT  03 APR 92 / UK Company News: WH Smith to inject Pounds 24m into Do It
All
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN THORNHILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WH SMITH is to inject Pounds 24m into Do It All, its DIY joint venture with
Boots, to help fund the roll-out of a new format aimed at the serious
home-improvement enthusiast.
At the same time, the two parent companies are tidying up Do It All's
shareholding structure, which was created through the merger of Boots's
Payless chain with WH Smith's Do It All two years ago.
Do It All's preference shares will be converted into Pounds 1 ordinary
shares, of which Boots will receive 48.5m and WH Smith 24.5m, reflecting the
difference in profitability between the two merged DIY businesses.
However, WH Smith will remain an equal partner by subscribing in cash for a
further 24m Pounds 1 shares.
The cash inflow will initially be used to reduce Do It All's borrowings and
will then be applied to financing the expansion of project-based DIY stores
which have been successfully trialled at Rugby and Stafford.
Mr David Thompson, Boots' finance director, said Do It All's stores would be
converted from August at the rate of six a month at a cost of about Pounds
250,000 apiece.
The DIY market has recently been disfigured by price discounting among the
market leaders, B&amp;Q and Texas Homecare, which has hit the 230-store Do It
All chain.
But Mr John Napier, Smith's finance director, said: 'Overall, our market is
stable despite the competitive activity. It is not buoyant but it is not
dreadfully awful. I am not sure that we share the City's view that there is
a mid-life crisis in the DIY industry.'
The restructuring is expected to have little effect on the reported earnings
of both parent companies this year. But City analysts suggest more money may
be needed next year to fund any further expansion.

FT  03 APR 92 / UK Company News: Smith New Court warns on new accounting
measures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEW ACCOUNTING standards will force investors and brokers to construct new
measures to analyse corporate performance, a circular from Smith New Court,
the securities house, warned yesterday.
Earnings per share figures will become far more volatile and force analysts
to adjust company data to analyse on-going company profits, which will make
their research reports less easy to compare.
Smith New Court's examination of the impact of the proposals being discussed
by the Accounting Standards Board is the latest in a series of documents
from analysts dealing with the issues raised.
The house says proposals to abolish all but a few extraordinary items will
cause profit figures to fluctuate, making earnings per share and dividend
cover less important measures.
Cash flow measurement will grow in importance, but it argues that the new
cash flow statement, which recently became compulsory, is proving difficult
to interpret.
It also suggests that plans to re-introduce current cost accounting on the
balance sheet deserve only low priority in an economy experiencing
relatively low inflation.
The proposed statement on reserve movements could divert attention from
other financial statements and cause confusion, the circular says.

FT  03 APR 92 / UK Company News: Chelsea given one week to find Pounds
22.85m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CHELSEA FOOTBALL Club has been given seven days to find Pounds 22.85m to buy
its Stamford Bridge ground in west London. The Court of Appeal yesterday
upheld a High Court decision about a contract for the sale.
If Chelsea does not pay, it faces eviction by its landlord Cabra Estates, a
property company with more than Pounds 50m debt. One observer claimed there
was as much chance of Chelsea finding the money as of the team becoming
league champions.
Mr John Duggan, chairman of Cabra, which already has an agreement to move
Fulham Football Club out of its nearby ground, said he hoped an alternative
venue could be found for Chelsea if the money were not forthcoming.
A twist to the story yesterday was that Mr Ken Bates, Chelsea's chairman,
increased his recently acquired stake in Cabra to 29.6 per cent. His
investment vehicle Vanbrugh has spent about Pounds 3m on shares in the past
week.
Mr Bates has called for an extraordinary meeting. Resolutions would include
the ousting of Mr Duggan and Mr Andrew Mackay, a non-executive who is the
Conservative MP for East Berkshire.
The appointment of one or more replacements would be proposed, although it
is understood some other shareholders would object to Mr Bates coming on to
the board because of the conflict of interest. He would in any case be
severely restricted in debates about the future of Stamford Bridge.
Negotiations between Chelsea and Cabra continued at least until Mr Duggan
departed for a skiing holiday in Colorado on Saturday. He said he had turned
down an offer of Pounds 10m cash plus some loan notes that could be
converted into shares.
Part of Mr Bates's argument for paying much less than Pounds 22.85m is the
availability of Pounds 5m for Fulham to ground share and a deduction for the
minority stake Chelsea has in the subsidiary that owns Stamford Bridge.
Mr Duggan returns on April 8. Chelsea's deadline is April 9.

FT  03 APR 92 / UK Company News: A balance sheet battering - How Heron has
been hit by the recession in all its main markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THIS MORNING Mr Gerald Ronson's Heron International will tell its bankers
that it is writing off more than Pounds 400m, over two thirds of its balance
sheet, because of the slump in worldwide property markets.
Heron will also ask the banks to reschedule its Pounds 1.3bn debt, and
announce the first pre-tax losses in its 26-year history for the financial
year that ended three days ago. The figures mean it will no longer rank as
the UK's second largest private company.
Heron is fighting recession in its key markets of property, housebuilding
and luxury car sales, and the request has not come as a complete surprise to
the financial markets, which have been heavily discounting its Eurobonds for
a year.
The problem is not that debt has soared. Heron's net debt has fallen
slightly in the past year to about Pounds 1.3bn, including Pounds 448m in
Eurobonds. That compares with Pounds 1.4bn in the March 1991 accounts, which
included Pounds 357m borrowings within the US businesses marked for
disposal.
However, the slump in US and UK property has savaged the balance sheet,
which had already seen write-offs of about Pounds 200m over the past few
years from the group's ill-fated move into US financial services
Heron will give a new figure for its net assets of about Pounds 150m,
compared with Pounds 585m in March 1991. At that date Heron's investment
property was valued at Pounds 772m, in the judgment of the group's senior
employees.
Heron says that it currently has over Pounds 100m of cash and liquid assets
and that there is no immediate crisis.
However, in anticipation of cashflow problems it will ask banks and
bondholders today to delay capital repayments until the last years of the
decade, and to delay some interest payments.
Apart from the US investments, Heron is in a position to paint a more
optimistic picture about the future value of its investments than many
property developers who have recently run into financial trouble. It is
expected to argue to the bankers that its portfolio of businesses has many
strengths, and that it has been peculiarly unfortunate in the acute
vulnerability of its main businesses to recession.
The response of the bankers will determine whether it is given the room to
realise the long-term value.
The group is not exposed to City and Docklands commercial property markets,
with their acute oversupply. Its office development near Heathrow has let
all 47,000 sq ft and will be completed by the end of 1992. Its developments
at Basildon and in Cornwall are fully let, as are the shops in Sunderland
town centre and Victoria Station in London. The Southampton investment,
which will be completed in the autumn, is about 82 per cent let.
Heron has also expanded its property division vigorously into Europe and
currently has developments in Berlin, Paris, Lyons, Brussels, Madrid and
Barcelona. Several recent sales of European investments showed a profit.
However, the most troublesome part of its property portfolio continues to be
the US. It started building two Manhattan tower blocks, called in
1980s-style Heron Towers I and II, but while the first is 95 per cent let,
building of the second has been frozen until the market improves.
It also holds 9,000 acres in Arizona, a legacy of its 1980 move into
financial services in the US south-west, and the subsequent collapse of the
local property market.
Unsurprisingly, the group's UK housebuilding division, Heron Homes, has been
hit by the collapse of the housing market. It will nevertheless tell bankers
that in the year to March 1992 it sold 900 homes - about 17 per cent up on
the previous year - and that its housing bank remains at 5,000 plots in
southern England with options on a further 6,300.
Its luxury car dealerships in the UK for Jaguar, Rover, Rolls Royce and its
Suzuki manufacturing franchises, have also suffered from recession, although
Mr Ronson has reiterated his commitment.
The fourth arm is petrol stations, whose cashflow supported some of the
group's early expansion. Last autumn Heron agreed to sell 150 stations to
Elf Aquitaine over the next two years in a deal believed to be worth about
Pounds 100m. One question bankers will ask is the effect of the disposal,
which will leave the group with only around 30 stations, on projected
cashflow.
On at least one division - albeit one of the smaller ones - Heron is
expected to tell an extremely encouraging story. Its distribution and
transportation services in the UK have increasingly focused on food, drinks
and white goods, and now count among their customers Zanussi, Electrolux,
Tricity and Bendix. Heron will report that in the 12 months just completed
sales were 'considerably up ' on the previous year.

FT  03 APR 92 / UK Company News: B Wehmiller recovers strongly to Pounds

<TEXT>
BARRY WEHMILLER Inter-national, the Cheshire-based packaging and process
machinery manufacturer, reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 2.25m for the six
months to January 31.
The outcome showed a 48 per cent decline on the comparable period, but
represented a sharp improvement on the second half of last year when profits
dived to just Pounds 715,000.
Mr Nigel McLean, chairman, said that the success of last October's Pounds
12.9m rights issue and cash generated from operations left the group with
nil gearing.
All units were now operating profitably and a modest increase in order
backlog showed a slight improvement in demand, he said.
Turnover dipped 9 per cent to Pounds 35.7m. The interim dividend is
maintained at 2.4p on the increased capital, from earnings of 3.9p (8.4p)

Airtours yesterday secured bonding facilities worth Pounds 92m over the next
five years. The bond is a condition laid down by the Civil Aviation
Authority to all holiday groups before being granted an operating licence,
writes Christopher Price.
However, the size of the bond is over twice that required by Airtours,
fuelling speculation that it is eyeing candidates for acquisition.
Mr Harry Coe, finance director, said: 'The reason we have gone for such a
large bond is because of the very good response from the banks, and also to
give us room for expansion. We are sitting on a lot of money, but not on our
hands. We are out there looking.'

FT  03 APR 92 / Growth in Germany helps Redland contain profits fall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STRONG growth in Germany helped Redland, the building materials group,
contain a fall in profits last year to 24 per cent, in line with market
expectations, in spite of a halving of the contribution from the UK.
The Reigate-based group, which last month won control of rival materials
group Steetley in a Pounds 600m bid, made pre-tax profits of Pounds 186.3m,
down from Pounds 245m.
The results were achieved after charging Pounds 11m of plant closure and
redundancy costs against operating profits but reflected the impact of the
UK recession.
Earnings per share fell from 50.7p to 30p but the group is recommending a
final dividend of 16.75p, giving a total of 25p, up from 23.35p last year.
For the first time Redland broke out the contribution from Germany, where
profits grew 20 per cent to Pounds 85.8m, or 45 per cent of total operating
profits.
Mr Gerald Corbett, finance director, said the Steetley acquisition would
help reduce exposure to Germany although the housing market was not slowing
in line with the German economy and eastern Germany was likely to remain a
fast-growing market.
Lower tax and financing costs and the benefits of integrating the
acquisition should enhance earnings per share by 10 per cent this year, he
said.
UK profits fell from Pounds 72.4m to Pounds 34.4m, with lower sales in
roofing, aggregates and bricks reflecting the recession in domestic
building. Profits also fell in continental Europe, outside Germany, in the
US and the Far East including Australasia.
Roofing profits fell only 7 per cent to Pounds 128.9m, buoyed by Braas in
Germany, the 51 per cent-controlled joint venture, with sales of concrete
roof tiles particularly strong in former east Germany.
Aggregates profits fell 40 per cent to Pounds 45m, although Western Mobile
in Colorado and Redland Stone in Texas benefited from more buoyant demand.
The interest charge fell from Pounds 12m to Pounds 300,000, as gearing fell
from 34 per cent to 10 per cent. After the Steetley acquisition gearing is
likely to end the year at about 24 per cent, but a refinancing of Steetley's
debt will save Pounds 3m in a full year.
The tax rate in 1991 rose to 27.5 per cent from 26 per cent, reflecting
higher profits in Germany, but could fall again as a result of the
acquisition.

FT  03 APR 92 / Scroggs moves up in Fisons shuffle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FISONS, the troubled UK pharmaceuticals group, yesterday reshuffled its
board. Mr Cedric Scroggs, chairman of the group's scientific equipment
division, has been appointed chief executive of the company and chairman of
the pharmaceuticals division.
The move fills the gap left by the resignation of Mr John Kerridge who
retired as chief executive last year. The company said Mr Peter Fothergill,
pharmaceuticals chairman, had also resigned.
Fisons also announced that US Food and Drug Administration officials were
due on April 20 to inspect its manufacturing facilities for Opticrom, its
hay-fever treatment, which has been withdrawn in the US at the request of
the FDA. It has not asked them to inspect the facilities for Imferon which
has also been withdrawn. The company has said it might not relaunch the
product.
The announcement pleased analysts, although there was some disappointment
they had not been able to find an external candidate from the
pharmaceuticals industry. The stock closed up 8p at 334p.
Mr Scroggs took over the scientific equipment division in 1981 when it had a
turnover of Pounds 64m and profits of Pounds 2.8m. Last year the division
made Pounds 68.4m on sales of Pounds 645m. More than 50 per cent of its
sales are now in the US.
Mr Scroggs said his appointment as chairman of the pharmaceutical division
ended the deficiencies in communications that had existed between the
pharmaceuticals management committee and the main board. The various
divisions will no longer operate as independent fiefdoms. He said it was too
early to give details of new strategic moves.
However, Mr Patrick Egan, group chairman, said the company was not in
negotiations with any other company with a view to merger, nor had it been,
nor had it received any offers. He added he had no intention of selling the
horticultural business.
Mr Egan said the pharmaceuticals division would concentrate on products for
respiratory and central nervous system ailments.
He said the company had something of a fetish about not collaborating with
other groups.
It was now looking at co-development and co-marketing projects, particularly
in the cardio-vascular field.

FT  03 APR 92 / MGN may have to write off Pounds 180m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MIRROR Group Newspapers is facing a write-off of Pounds 180m, a much larger
amount than previously realised. The figure is contained in accounts being
finalised following the death of Mr Robert Maxwell and the realisation that
Pounds 99m had been borrowed from MGM and not returned.
The accounts are being produced to prepare MGN, which publishes the Daily
and Sunday Mirror, The People and the Scottish Daily Record and Sunday Mail,
for sale later this year.
Fifty-one per cent of the shares of the publicly quoted MGN are held by the
private Maxwell interests now in administration and effectively controlled
by banks.
A collection of Maxwell deals charged to MGM in addition to the missing
Pounds 99m has taken the write-off total to Pounds 180m.
They include:
A loss on the sale of a stake in the Canadian commercial printing company
Quebecor Printing and a CDollars 50m (Pounds 24m) loan attributable to MGM.
A liability to Mr Mark Booth, former chief executive of MTV when Maxwell
sold his stake in the pop music channel.
Rent arrears on the MGM's Worship Street premises.
The considerable financing and consultancy charges being paid to banks.
The unexpectedly large write-offs suggest that MGM is in a worse financial
state than previously believed but is unlikely to be fatal. The company is
still trading profitably.
Final agreement was reached this week on interim financing to take MGM until
the end of May.

FT  03 APR 92 / Recession pushes Sun Alliance to Pounds 466m loss
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SUN ALLIANCE, the largest and financially strongest UK general insurer, sank
deeper into the red by posting pre-tax losses for 1991 of Pounds 466.2m and
completing a gloomy reporting round for the UK's insurance sector.
All leading composite groups have reported increased pre-tax losses over the
past six weeks and, like its competitors, Sun Alliance has been hit by the
UK recession, the depressed housing market and a rise in crime leading to
increased claims.
The pre-tax loss was at the bottom end of expectations and compared with a
deficit of Pounds 180.9m in 1990, when results were adversely affected by
heavy storm damage in January.
The loss further eroded Sun Alliance's financial strength reducing net
assets to Pounds 1.68bn, compared with Pounds 2.03bn the previous year.
The group's solvency margin, which measures net assets as a percentage of
non-life premium income, dropped to 63 per cent at the end of 1991 compared
with 83 per cent last year.
Losses were concentrated in the domestic mortgage indemnity and household
account, an area which until recently was considered low risk by insurers.
Losses on domestic mortgage indemnity, which arise when mortgage lenders are
unable to recoup the full value of outstanding loans on sales of repossessed
property, amounted to Pounds 320m and accounted for more than half UK
underwriting losses of Pounds 491m, compared with losses of Pounds 267m last
year. The average cost of domestic mortgage indemnity claims amounted to
Pounds 15,000.
Subsidence claims were Pounds 117m, up from Pounds 146m, and theft dogged
the household contents and private motor accounts. Motor losses amounted to
Pounds 72.4m, up from Pounds 50m, in spite of rate increases of 25 per cent
during the year.
Increased fire and theft claims produced losses for the group's commercial
business, and the group's liability business was also hit by a large number
of claims against surveyors for faulty valuations.
The group announced a maintained final dividend, giving a total for the year
of 14.25p, an increase of 1.8 per cent.
Mr Scott Nelson, general manager, said: 'In the light of this phenomenal
loss it was inconceivable to think of increasing (but) we will seek to
re-establish real growth in the dividend as soon as we can.'
The markets reacted calmly marking the share up 2p initially before it fell
back to finish unchanged at 250p.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Boris Yeltsin yesterday sought to placate critics of his government's
tough economic policies by relieving Mr Yegor Gaidar, the Russian first
deputy prime minister in charge of economic reform, of his post as finance
minister.
News of the change came as Mr Gaidar was giving an interview to the
Financial Times. He conceded he had been forced to quit partly to placate
the fierce critics of his economic reform policy.
He announced a softening of the policy on credits, with credits of about
Rbs100bn being ex-tended to deeply indebted enterprises now warning of
closures and soaring unemployment.
The position of finance minister is taken by Mr Vasily Barchuk, a deputy
finance minister and long-time finance official.
Mr Gaidar stressed, however, that he would stay on as first deputy prime
minister, adding: 'I will be able to concentrate more on the general
problems of the economy', from the standpoint of both reform and policy.
Mr Gaidar's economic programme has won support from western aid donors. It
was considered an important factor be-hind a promise of Dollars 24bn (Pounds
14bn) in assistance from the Group of Seven leading industrialised countries
announced this week.
International financial officials in Moscow took the news calmly. A World
Bank official said: 'We will have to hold judgment until we see what it
means for the programme,' but added that it seemed to suggest a lessening in
the intensity of the programme. Another expert pointed out that the IMF
resources would remain tied to rigorous conditions, whatever government took
over.
Mr Gaidar said Mr Yeltsin would remain as head of the cabinet in a more
extensive reshuffle which may be announced today or at the weekend in
advance of a session of the Russian Congress of Peoples Deputies which is
likely to be hostile towards the government.
Mr Gaidar would not confirm that Mr Gennady Burbulis, his fellow first
deputy prime minister, would retain his post. Mr Burbulis, a close confidant
of Mr Yeltsin, is unpopular with the Russian deputies.
Mr Gaidar said 'we will survive' the Congress of Peoples Deputies. He
conceded, however, that he expected fierce criticism.
'The easy thing to do would have been to drastically loosen our monetary
policy. We are not going to do that, but we will have to ease it a little,'
he said.
The softening in credit policy and the shuffling of the ministers point to a
deal between Mr Yeltsin and the leading critics in the Russian parliament.
Mr Gaidar said he no longer held to the goal of balancing the Russian budget
by the year end.

FT  03 APR 92 / Sharp rise in vacancies for executive posts reported
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INDICATIONS that the economy may be reviving have been supported by a survey
pointing to a sharp increase in the demand for executives to fill top jobs
in industry.
According to a survey by InterExec, a recruitment consultancy, the number of
top jobs for which candidates are being sought increased by 17 per cent in
the first quarter compared with the same period last year.
Mr Philip Burton, marketing director, said: 'This gives a strong sign that
companies are trying to get their top management teams sorted out.'
He added: 'It may be an indication of a pick-up in economic activity.'
The survey comes as economists hunt for clues to whether the 18-month
recession is drawing to an end.
Indications that companies are stepping up their recruitment efforts may be
a signal that industry as a whole is more hopeful about the chances of
increased sales.
Interpretation of InterExec's data is difficult, however, since its survey
is only four years old. The survey is based on information collected from
about 1,000 separate employers and recruitment companies, and may not
provide a complete snapshot of the jobs market.
According to the survey, companies were trying to fill 1,749 vacancies for
top jobs in the first quarter compared with 1,490 in the first quarter of
last year, a rise of 17 per cent. In the fourth quarter last year the
year-on-year rise in vacancies was 4 per cent.
Most of the vacancies are for posts of managing director or head of a
corporate function such as sales or finance. Virtually all involve salaries
of Pounds 25,000 or more.
Efforts to fill all the vacancies in the survey are focused on methods other
than advertising, for instance use of 'search' or recruitment consultants.
InterExec reckons its survey covers between a third and half of all
vacancies filled by such means.

FT  03 APR 92 / Apparent irregularities found involving former Lloyd's
agency
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER and ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INVESTIGATORS have un-earthed evidence of apparent irregularities at
businesses formerly administered by Gooda Walker, a Lloyd's agency which
managed some of the worst loss-making syndicates in 1989 and 1990.
The discovery is likely to have serious implications for the legal battles
between Names, who are the individuals whose capital backs insurance
business, Lloyd's and their agents.
Names are insisting that cash calls needed to pay more than Pounds 200m in
losses made in 1989 and 1990 by the Gooda Walker syndicates should be frozen
while investigations continue.
The evidence of apparent irregularities was discovered by GW Run Off, an
agency set up to manage the affairs of Gooda Walker, and is contained in an
affidavit presented by Lloyd's to the Commercial Court on Tuesday. It
centres on the use of so-called time and distance policies. These allow
syndicates to reinsure known liabilities with outside reinsurers.
Before its liquidation last year Gooda Walker managed eight syndicates which
mainly specialised in catastrophe reinsurance.
Yesterday Mr Alan Lord, chief executive of Lloyd's, said that GW Run Off, a
company formed to manage the syndicates, had exposed 'a number of
transactions which appear to have rather odd and perhaps damaging
consequences for Names'.
However despite the new information Lloyd's would continue to press Names
'to pay cash calls and if necessary draw down the deposits,' said Mr Lord.
Failure to meet claims from its policy holders would damage the insurance
market's tarnished reputation. This means that the legal action by 820 Names
who are seeking court injunctions to prevent Lloyd's from drawing down their
deposits will continue next Monday. 'I do not think it will change our
prospects of succeeding in our ability to draw down on Names' deposits. It
will not change the substance of our case,' added Mr Lord .
The case in which the Names are being represented by Michael Freeman &amp; Co
was adjourned on Tuesday to allow both sides to consider the new evidence.
The Gooda Walker Action Group, some of whose members are party to the
Freeman action, may now mount a separate legal action.

FT  03 APR 92 / Leading Article: Modernising the UK state
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MODERNISING the governance of the UK will be a central challenge for
whichever government emerges on April 10. Demands for the reform of
Britain's system of government are growing, yet the debate in the election
campaign has been limp.
On grounds of political efficiency alone, there is ample justification for
reforming the management of the British state. The decline in local
government has allowed central government to gather to itself overweening
power. Parliament offers inadequate checks and balances to the power of the
executive, leading to blunders such as the poll tax. Westminster itself is
losing power to Brussels, yet behaves as if little has changed.
There is now a well-established agenda of issues. Top of the list is
Scottish devolution, which - barring electoral upsets - will be
irresistible. The Scots should have home rule if they choose it in a
referendum, provided they accept a reduction in the number of their MPs at
Westminster to give them equal representation with English and Welsh voters.
There is a pressing need to re-establish strong and accountable local
government with a stable fiscal base. That includes an authority for London
in order, at the very least, to deal with planning, transport, economic
development and promotion. The wealth of quangos and opted-out bodies which
run everything from the health service to individual schools must be made
accountable.
Questionable case
The case for an assembly in Wales and regional government in England is more
questionable, but if the Scots have their assembly, pressure for wider
reform will grow. Increasingly, English regions feel disadvantaged in the
EC, as Brussels relates to a Europe des regions.
Even with devolution, however, Westminster would remain a tool for elective
dictatorships. Fixed-term parliaments, freedom of information legislation,
an elected second chamber and a bill of rights are all gathering support.
So, too, is electoral reform for the House of Commons to ensure that no
government is able to rule without the support of a majority of the
electorate (one reason why every emerging democracy in eastern Europe has
chosen proportional representation). A by-product would almost certainly be
much greater political stability, with change incremental rather than by the
swing of the political pendulum - something which business should welcome.
Not immune
Sadly - and despite the best endeavours of Charter 88, the constitutional
reform campaign - these issues have not had the airing they deserve. The
Conservatives deny that there is a problem. They claim virtue in resisting
Scottish devolution, which could easily mean prolonged Conservative rule in
England. However, a fourth-term Tory government will not be immune from the
pressures for change from Brussels - or from Edinburgh.
To his credit (and self-interest) Mr Paddy Ashdown has banged the drum for
reform, arguing that constitutional change is a pre-requisite for solving
the UK's economic and social problems. Labour has endorsed parts of the same
programme, apart from a strange desire to write its own bill of rights
rather than incorporate the European Convention into UK law. But there is a
whiff of a play for the Liberal Democratic vote in this endorsement - Labour
seems unable to provide convincing answers to the detailed questions about
reform, such as the timetable for change and the functions of different
tiers of government.
Labour deserves credit, however, for setting up its commission on electoral
reform, chaired by Professor Raymond Plant. Some think this a cynical
exercise, certain to be shelved if Labour acquires an overall majority. But
the first Plant report offers a cogent and erudite review of the options on
electoral reform and the arguments for and against each.
If Labour leads the next government (in or out of coalition), it should be
held to its pledge to convert the Plant commission into an official review
involving a wider spectrum of opinion. The next parliament is the time for
careful debate and action on this vital topic.

which exploit the old nice/nasty police technique.
A female machine asks a mixture of nice soft questions ('Who is your

should the electorate trust your party with the NHS?') while her male
counterpart inserts nasty supplementaries ('How do you square that claim

C4's Short Stories (8.30) investigates a course run by British Airways for

FT  03 APR 92 / Arts: Daylight allowed in on magic
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sovereign, the unprecedented exhibition about Queen Elizabeth II that opens
at the Victoria &amp; Albert Museum today, will be enjoyed by visitors in
different ways. For me, one of the most eloquent images is a rather mundane
photograph of the European Community summit meeting in London in 1977.
There is Valery Giscard d'Estaing, the president of France, standing next to
the Queen, looking his imperial best and about seven feet tall. Chancellor
Schmidt is almost concealed between some half-forgotten politicians. Giulio
Andreotti, then as so often prime minister of Italy, has placed himself
well. James Callaghan, the British prime minister, smiles on benignly from
the side.
Where is Giscard now? The image could be repeated time and again, for the
Queen has survived so many comings and goings. She must have known more
Commonwealth leaders than anyone else in the world. At home she has watched
the departure of eight prime ministers - possibly nine by next week. Her
private diaries would be as priceless as some of her jewels.
It is the mixture of continuity and change that astounds. The Queen never
ceases to adapt. Bagehot wrote of the monarchy in a well-known line: 'We
must not let daylight in on magic.' But, in a controlled way, the Queen has
been letting in daylight all the time. The Palace may complain that the
Royal Family is sometimes maltreated and misrepresented by the press, but
the interesting question about the monarchy and the media is who uses whom.
You will not find the complete answer in Sovereign, but there is some
fascinating evidence. The Queen and British television came of age together.
It was the Queen who insisted that her coronation in 1953 should be shown
live on the small screen. Sir Norman Brook, the cabinet secretary, wrote a
minute saying that this would open the door to the unthinkable: for example,
the televising of the House of Commons. Churchill let the Queen have her
way, and television took off.
So did other families. Listen to the broadcast of the coronation today, as
you can in Sovereign, and the voice is unmistakably Dimbleby: it could just
as well been David, at times even Jonathan, as Richard. Even the cameraman
at the Abbey wore morning dress.
The rest of the media were friendly to the point of reverential. When the
BBC Home Service carried a bulletin from the Palace, it was spoken in tones
that suggested the whole nation must listen, and perhaps it did.
Pathe news in the cinema did it with more dash, but with the same belief
that everything British must be good, especially when blessed by the Queen.
When it showed Her Majesty opening the country's first atomic power station
at Calder Hall, the next line was about how the 180 families were to live
there. When the Queen went to Germany in 1965, the banner headline in the
Daily Sketch was KAMERADSCHAFT, under the strap 'The Queen appeals to West
Germany: let's be partners in Europe'.
How times have changed. The Sketch has long since disappeared and is
remembered, if at all, as the definition of a really frivolous newspaper -
even more so than the tabloids that have survived. The Queen preferred
broadcasting and continues to do so, possibly because it is so much easier
to control, and the press can turn fickle.
Sovereign contains lots of old film. It is remarkable to watch how many
firsts she has witnessed and sometimes initiated. She saw in not only atomic
power, but also Concorde, the decimalisation of the currency, North Sea oil
and - the exhibition reminds us - the election of the first black woman MP
to Westminster. She was the first monarch to visit the prime minister's
country residence at Chequers.
The guide to Sovereign suggests that the Queen has the best-known face in
the world today. With the stamps, the coins and the banknotes, that may be
true.
Yet the exhibition understates, I think, her contribution to the
Commonwealth and the concern of some other members of the Royal Family about
poverty in the third world and dereliction in the inner cities.
Of course, there is much more besides, like the display of the Queen's
wardrobe over the years, brilliantly treading the narrow line between
dullness and ostentation.
There are also some of the Queen's paintings, the replica of a state dinner
with its gold service, the original Magna Carta, pictures of horses and
dogs: the regal along with the homely.
See it for what you will. There is nothing about the excesses of the young
royals or of the media baying for scandal, which are among the problems of
the modern monarchy. Sovereign comes over as a portrait of a responsible
woman determined to carry on with her duties.
The exhibition is sponsored by Reed International, the Daily Telegraph and
Pearson, which owns the Financial Times. Not even the organisers are sure
how far it will draw the crowds.

FT  03 APR 92 / Arts: The Taming of the Shrew - Royal Shakespeare Company,
Stratford-upon-Avon
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ST GEORGE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Montaigne knew that good marriages abjure the company and conditions of love
and endeavour to present those of amity: 'It is a sweet society of life,
full of consistency, of trust and an infinite number of profitable and solid
offices, and mutual obligations.' But the connubial coup in Bill Alexander's
exciting Taming of the Shrew (Royal Shakespeare Company) has nothing to do
with Kate and Petruchio; it has to do with the plot.
At last a director has succeeded in marrying the shabby Christopher Sly
scenes to the lustrous central action of the Shrew. This is, as Shakespeare
nearly said, a true marriage of impediments which nobody minds. As a piece
of theatre, it is intelligent, magical, and wholly absorbing.
Christopher Sly has always troubled directors. Jonathan Miller (RSC 1987)
excised him, but here, Alexander has rewritten his scenes and made them
germane to the action. A group of jeunesse doree (1992 vintage) comes across
the drunken Sly and decides to take him home to an Elizabethan dress
performance of the Shrew.
The exterior scaffolding set gives way to a candlelit wood-panelled
interior, sofas and sweetmeats on a dais. Sly sits among the floppy
aristocrats, watching the performance which they share with the theatre
audience. He intervenes occasionally, reassured by Petruchio, 'It's all
right, it's only a play.'
But what starts as a joke - fooling the drunk - transforms itself, by the
alchemy of drama, and beguiles the tricksters. This revives the play's
concerns with states of wakefulness and dreaming. Sly is put back, finally
waking to see the actors arriving for an after-show drink.
By framing the action, Alexander sidesteps the play's political difficulties
in the post-feminist 1990s, since his Shrew has become a performance within
a play.
Alexander is not hamstrung by the self-censorship of political correctness:
Kate's final speech no longer has to be ironic, for she speaks it not to the
theatre but to a self-possessed 20th-century woman in the closet audience. A
feminist reaction is one among many in a complex and crowded scene.
The Shrew itself, played on a bare stage, has great energy and verve. It
will tighten and quicken as the season advances. The principals are apt and
subtle. Anton Lesser's Petruchio is the confused New Man of the 1980s: a
soft centre baked to a hard exterior, and never simply the brawling
braggadocio of tradition.
Opposite him, Amanda Harris as Kate appears in a poisonous crouch, every
vituperation wrenched from her like a concession. When she lightens up and
agrees with Petruchio that the 'sun' is indeed the 'moon - or what you
will', one senses the strong, uneasy accommodation of two strong wills.
Below stairs, Geoffrey Freshwater as Grumio plays the natural roustabout
man's man. He involves the drawling closet onlookers in the dangerous
homecoming scene (Dorian MacDonald and Barnaby Kay are particularly good at
playing non-actors acting) ahead of Petruchio and Katherine.
Elsewhere, the parallel plot which Dr Johnson thought exquisitely entwined
with the wooing of Kate, is carried by Trevor Martin as a sonorous Baptista,
Rebecca Saire as a willowy Bianca, and a trio of suitors lead by John
McAndrew's bland Lucentio.
The staging is meticulous and exact, the lighting imaginative, the overall
effect consistently winning. This production calls up the visceral world of
the Sonnets, also from the 1590s: 'Thus have I had thee as a dream doth
flatter: In sleep a king, but waking no such matter.'
In repertory until January 1993 at the Royal Shakespeare Theatre,

FT  03 APR 92 / Arts: Gounod's Sapho
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RONALD CRICHTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Saint-Etienne, an industrial town in hilly country south-west of Lyon, was
graced during the Malraux era with a large cultural centre with among other
things three theatres: large, small and experimental. The place hums with
activity. On the musical side, Saint-Etienne has been conspicuous for
Massenet revivals - he was a local boy. There will be a festival and
symposium later this year. Meanwhile Saint-Etienne has scored a hit with
Gounod's Sapho - not to be confused with Massenet's opera of the same name
on a contemporary subject.
Sapho, Gounod's first work for the theatre, was commissioned by the Paris
Opera at the instigation of the mezzosoprano Pauline Viardot, already famous
and influential after her success in Meyerbeer's Le Prophete. Apart from
some church music, Gounod was an unknown quantity. The Opera, unwilling to
risk the expense of a five-act blockbuster, prudently asked for a shortish
work which would allow room for a ballet in the same programme. The chosen
librettist was Emile Augier, a successful author whose plays were domestic
dramas in full reaction against Romantic excess.
The premiere in 1851 had a mixed reception. Viardot in the title-role was
admired; Berlioz found much to praise in the score, but neither then nor in
subsequent revisions (reduced to two acts, then puffed up into four) was the
public won over. The fault surely lay less in the music, much of which is in
Gounod's most personal lyrical vein, than in the book - a lop-sided, uneasy
mixture of public ceremonial, private intrigue and political conspiracy.
We meet the poetess Sapho at the Games at Olympia, where she wins a contest
with an ode about Hero and Leander. Sapho loves and is loved by Phaon, a
flawed hero-figure, also loving and loved by a viperish stop-at-nothing
courtesan, Glycera. Phaon is involved in a conspiracy against the (unseen)
tyrant Pittacus. By threatening to expose him, Glycera blackmails Sapho into
rejecting Phaon and forces Phaon to take her with him into exile. The
miserable Sapho throws herself into the sea, not (as in some versions of the
legend) from a rock in Leucas, but in her native Lesbos.
For only two performances, SaintEtienne honoured Gounod with a musically and
visually rewarding production. The producer Denis Krief successfully
combined dance-mime (the athletes' scenes, frieze-like tableaux vivants
perceived through gauze, were ravishing) and chorus movement. Krief was also
responsible for the sets and the soft, romantic lighting. Sapho did not leap
visibly into the sea but was gradually obscured by Turneresque clouds. The
style was Greek-classical seen through 19th century French painters' eyes.
Gerard Audier designed the costumes.
The only number in the opera familiar today is Sapho's valedictory 'O ma
lyre inmortelle' (recorded by Crespin among others), a piece of long-limbed,
grave lyricism. That it is so satisfying as a finale is the more curious
because it is really a strophic song with two verses and a short coda.
Michele Command, who had sung the earlier scenes with charm, dignity and
sensitive phrasing, rose to the occasion.
As for the wretched Phaon, with whom the weak and vacillating composer
surely - if perhaps unconsciously - identified, the only thing a tenor can
do is to sing the music (better than the character deserves) as
mellifluously as possible. Christian Papis did well. As the viper Glycera,
the Canadian soprano Sharon Coste showed a vibrant voice of great promise.
But since she swallowed most of her words, the result was inconclusive.
The 'Nouvel Orchestre' of Saint-Etienne has been thoroughly trained in a
short time by Patrick Fournillier, the moving spirit in these revivals. On
the first night this able conductor was showing a degree of consideration
for the singers which Gounod's transparent scoring hardly calls for. There
is grandeur as well as clarity in this score. In future performances
Fournillier could afford to give the orchestra more headway. That will only
be possibly if this staging, as it deserves, can be shown in other theatres.
A live recording is promised. Meanwhile the excellent Cambreling version
with Katherine Ciesinski and Alain Vanzo has been transferred to CD
(Rodolphe RPV 32663.64).

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
London's planning regime is once again on the political agenda. Rarely has
the overhaul of the capital's planning system seemed so necessary.
Consider, for instance, three decisions taken in the past two weeks.
This week the London Docklands Development Corporation (LDDC) gave
permission for Olympia &amp; York, the Canadian developer, to build another 3.2m
sq ft of offices at Heron Quay, next to Canary Wharf.
Yet the need for these offices is unproven. There is already 34m sq ft of
vacant office space in London and 33m sq ft of offices are under
construction or seeking planning approval in the Dockland's enterprise zone
alone. O&amp;Y's ability to undertake the scheme is also in doubt at a time when
it is seeking a restructuring of its Dollars 20bn debt.
The problems of Canary Wharf, which is 40 per cent unlet, highlight a more
general point about the Dockland's laissez-faire planning policy. Tenants
have been deterred by the delayed introduction of adequate infrastructure
and the lack of thought that has gone into making the area a pleasant place
to live and work.
Critics also argue that the sweeping planning powers of the LDDC have
prevented discussion of alternative uses for the land. 'There exists a
desperate need for other uses for the land: schemes for social housing,
child-care and training provision and local employment,' says the Docklands
consultative committee, an association of Labour-led local authorities.
Proposals to redevelop a former goods yard at Kings Cross, the largest
inner-city site in Europe, remain in the balance, after four years of
negotiations. The local authority, Camden, met last week to consider the
decision of its chief planning officer that a 10.3m sq ft planning
application provided 'the basis for an acceptable scheme', given certain
conditions.
But hopes for a swift decision were dashed. Although Camden's planning
committee says it wants a settlement, it first wants further negotiations
and assurances on the viability of the scheme. 'What this unhappy saga
illustrates is the total inability of our planning system to determine
applications within a reasonable amount of time,' says Mr Mark Fisher,
Labour's shadow arts minister, in his book on London's future* co-written
with architect Sir Richard Rogers.
After lying empty for several years, County Hall, the home of the Greater
London Council, was sold last week to a Japanese developer which plans to
turn it into a hotel; the deal, however, will not be completed until Autumn
next year.
Labour, which has pledged to reverse the sale, says the announcement of the
deal, just days before the UK general election, was provocative. However,
the deal invites parallels with the GLC's own highly controversial transfer
of land at Coin Street on the south bank of the River Thames to community
builders - just before the Tory government abolished the London authority in
1986.
The future of County Hall is the most politically-charged planning issue of
them all, since a Labour government would use part of the building for its
proposed Greater London Authority, which would be in charge of strategic
planning across the capital.
The very idea of strategic planning for London is controversial. The concept
is disliked in principle by those who think that London's character stems
from the haphazard way it has evolved over the decades.
The drawing up of a strategic plan itself poses many practical problems,
says the Conservative party. 'When the GLC drew up its strategic master plan
for London, it took 11 years and was out of date by the time it was
finished,' says the party's manifesto for London.
On the issue of the relaxed planning conditions in Docklands, the Tory party
strongly defends its action, stating that this was essential to revive the
area. 'Between them, the GLC and the east end London boroughs effectively
frustrated any attempt to bring life and investment back to the declining
Docklands,' the manifesto states.
The case in favour of strategic planning is three-fold. First, boroughs are
reluctant to turn down commercial propositions, even bad ones, for fear of
losing the jobs that come with the project. Second, initiatives that could
benefit the whole city are neglected, if they inconvenience the borough
concerned.
Third, and perhaps most important, immense amounts of time, money and effort
are wasted because each proposal stirs up fundamental issues about the shape
and character of the capital.
'Opportunities have been lost and overseas investors have been discouraged,'
says Hillier Parker, the chartered surveyors, citing schemes such as King's
Cross and County Hall which have both been involved in lengthly planning
battles.
Advocates of strategic planning dismiss the charge that such a concept would
be unwieldy in practice by citing the examples of Barcelona, Paris and
Rotterdam (see other article), which have introduced comprehensive plans to
redevelop run-down city areas. 'What these cities demonstrate is that it is
possible to draw up strategic plans and realise them,' says Mr Fisher.

FT  03 APR 92 / The Property Market: Rotterdam - Europe's 'Manhattan on the
Maas'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAZEL DUFFY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Rotterdam has been widely praised for the broad scope of its strategic
plans, best illustrated by its ambitious proposals to redevelop its docks.
The Dutch city is starting in earnest on a plan to transform the
100-year-old docks on the south side of the River Maas into a commercial and
residential area. When completed by the end of the decade the Hop van Zuid
development will account for a quarter of the city's projected office space.
Rotterdam is best known as the city with a huge port. As far as offices are
concerned, Amsterdam is the favoured city. The Hop van Zuid project is
designed to boost Rotterdam's attractions as a location for international
business.
The project will link the north side of the city, where most offices are
situated, with the poorer southern end. The most potent symbol of the
linkage will be a new Fl 365m (Pounds 113.70m) bridge, to be completed by
late 1995.
The authorities hope the elegant design will become an international symbol
for a city which, for all its careful post-war planning, lacks the big city
status of Amsterdam.
The bridge, the new metro station, roads, and viaduct will be financed by
the local and national government.
As a prelude, the city authorities have studied London Docklands, and the
New York waterfront developments. They believe that by installing the
communications at the same time, or even before, the other big developments,
such as offices and houses, they will avoid the problems which have dogged
London Docklands.
They hope also to avoid the tension between the people who live there now,
and those who will move into the thousands of new homes planned over several
phases. Up to half the new houses will be social housing.
Local residents - some of whom have been unemployed for years - will be
trained as construction workers under a joint public/private sector scheme.
Discussions are also under way to interest local people in running retail
businesses in the planned festival market.
The showpiece of the project is planned for the Wilhelmina Pier area. Work
has started on the conversion of the former headquarters of the Holland
America Line into a hotel, with the financial backing of the city and
European Community funds.
A large part of the Wilhelmina Pier area, in total 125 hectares, will be
given over to the construction of offices. The area has already has been
dubbed 'Manhattan on the Maas' by the local press, although the City
authorities are playing down the tone of extravagant development which this
comparison suggests.
A private sector consortium was recently appointed to conduct a study on
setting up the master plan for the Wilhelmina Pier phase. Laing Management
Holdings, a British group, is lead manager; French construction group SAE
will contribute development expertise; and MBO, a Dutch group, will be
advising on financial and development matters.
Construction in the Wilhelmina Pier area is planned to start in 1995, by
which time communications infrastructure is scheduled to be in place  -
essential if the scheme is to attract private sector backing.
The Hop van Zuid project will kick off with the construction of offices to
house the tax, district court and judiciary; work will start next year.
Hop van Zuid has its critics: many say there is too much office space in a
city where the greater need is for replacement of existing stock; there is
too much provision for private housing; and too much money is being spent on
the bridge.
Dutch financiers are taking a wait and see attitude. They will want to test
the area's ability to attract tenants for the private sector built offices
before making a commitment. The logic of the project in terms of overall
city planning, however, is impressive.

FT  03 APR 92 / Valuers accused of knocking down the housing market: The
competing theories for the continuing decline in prices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BARCHARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LAST autumn building societies and estate agents thought that the worst news
was over in the housing market and that recovery would get under way soon.
They were badly wide of the mark. November to January saw house prices fall
by more than 1 percentage point each month, according to two main
house-price indices, published by Halifax and Nationwide building societies.
On Tuesday Nationwide published figures showing that prices fell again in
February, although less steeply, by 0.2 per cent. This encouraged some
observers to say that the housing market may finally have bottomed out.
After two years of deep gloom the consistently downward trend is a nasty
surprise for mortgage lenders and home owners alike, many of whom had
expected a recovery in the market months ago.
The shock is particularly disagreeable if you are a prospective purchaser
who has made an offer on a home after persuading the seller to cut his price
substantially, but still find that the valuer's price is less than the one
you are offering.
Estate agents report cases in which buyers, finding that they have to raise
several thousand pounds more because of a low valuation, are forced to
withdraw an offer.
Mr Derek Taylor, general manager of Halifax's estate agency chain, says: 'A
first-time buyer looks for a very high percentage mortgage loan and has got
little cash to put in and may want a 95 per cent mortgage. So if the house
is valued down by a couple of thousand pounds, it is a lot of money to
them.'
Several reasons are given for the price collapse: first-time buyers are
still reluctant to enter the market; people who bought at the top of the
housing boom in 1988, and who expected to become second or third-time buyers
in the early 1990s, find themselves grounded; and an upsurge in home
repossessions - 74,500 in 1991 - has drowned any reviving demand.
Builders, some estate agents, and housing market analysts suggest a further
factor. They believe that valuers and surveyors are talking the market down
with pessimistic house-price estimates.
Mr Frank Harris, a City estate agent, gives one example: 'We were horrified
at a drop of 15 per cent by one valuer, when we could show from our records
that the market in the City had dropped by only 2 per cent or 3 per cent.'
Virtually no lenders, and very few estate agents, can be found who are
willing to criticise valuers in public.
A typical view is that it is difficult to value property in a falling market
and the general public should realise that the days of inflated house-price
expectations are gone.
Royal Life Estates, the largest UK chain with 584 residential offices, said:
'We have been struggling for the past two years to get people to be
realistic about what their homes are now worth. It is a very fine line
between getting the valuation level with what potential vendors are prepared
to accept and what a building society is prepared to lend on.'
Some outside specialist observers of the housing finance industry, however,
are convinced that unnecessarily low valuations are a serious handicap to
the market.
John Wriglesworth, a housing finance specialist at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, the
City stockbroker, says: 'Many valuers are being ultra-cautious, because they
are scared of possible legal actions, and this is killing some transactions
and stopping the market reviving.'
One estate agent who agrees is Mr Harry Hill, joint general manager at
Hambro Countrywide, another of the large estate agency chains. 'In my view,
the valuers are causing part of the fall in house prices,' he says.
'We did a survey of our experience in 50 sales in two separate areas and
found that in one area 27 out of 50, and in the other 23 out of 50, had been
downvalued.'
Mr Hill says that valuers sometimes cut a valuation by suspiciously small
amounts. 'Valuers are always working from an agreed purchase price arrived
at after lengthy bargaining, so to value the property differently by Pounds
150 is extremely pedantic.'
Why should that be happening? One unprovable, and hotly denied, theory is
that the lenders have issued secret instructions to valuers to cut prices
back to the bone. On that view, some valuations now reflect not the normal
sale price of a house, but rather what it would fetch if it was offered in a
distressed sale or after repossession by the lender.
Newly built houses have been especially prone to this kind of downgrading.
Last September the House Builders Federation voiced its members' suspicions
at a meeting with several large lenders.
Mr Paul Hale, managing director of Nationwide Building Society Surveyors,
says: 'It is not in the interests of lenders or valuers to ensure that a
deal goes under by downvaluing deliberately.'
A more plausible theory is that valuers have become ultra-cautious because
they fear being sued if their valuation is proved wrong. Even when there is
no litigation, querying of valuations has become more common.
The Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors' insurance arm says claims
against about 4,000 firms that use its insurance schemes have increased
since 1988. That year it had about 350 claims, costing about Pounds 2.5m. By
1990 there were more than 700 claims and the cost jumped to Pounds 18m.
Mr David Gilchrist, general manager at Halifax Building Society, points out:
'There may may be some nervousness out there. It is always difficult to make
a judgment when there are few buyers and fewer transactions around.'

FT  03 APR 92 / ITC chief backs calls for fewer TV groups
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR George Russell, chairman of the Independent Television Commission, last
night backed the growing calls for fewer and larger ITV companies.
He acknowledged that some ITV chairmen wanted a reduction in the number of
ITV companies from 16 to no more than four or five in order to stave off
foreign takeovers.
'Personally I'm unperturbed at the prospect of mergers,' Mr Russell said,
although that would require an amendment to the rules of ownership in the
1990 Broadcasting Act. The commission would hold licensees to their
obligations on regional programming whether there were mergers or not.
Mr Russell, in the annual Fleming Memorial lecture, attacked the rules
allowing European Community companies to take over ITV companies wholly
while in most cases British companies were prevented from controlling
broadcasters in other Community countries. From 1994, at least in theory,
all 16 ITV licences could be held by European companies based outside the
UK.
Mr Russell said: 'That's only acceptable if British companies are given the
same opportunities in Europe.'
He also urged:
Broadcasting of news in the UK should be run on more businesslike lines if
its potential is to be fulfilled.
A single regulatory body should be set up to cover all broadcasting,
including the BBC, as a way of cutting over-regulation and government
interference.

<TEXT>
SONY (UK), the distributor of Sony electronic products in the UK and
Ireland, yesterday announced plans to relocate its headquarters to a
business park at Weybridge, Surrey, Vanessa Houlder writes.
It has agreed to pay Pounds 29 a sq ft for a 180,000 sq ft building on the
Brooklands Park on which construction will start this summer. Trafalgar
House, the developer, says it is the largest office pre-let on a UK business
park.
About 550 Sony staff will relocate to the building at the end of next year.
Sony UK said it had taken two years to pick its new location from a variety
of options in west and southwest London.
Trafalgar House also said it was buying British Aerospace's 50 per cent
interest in the joint venture company set up in 1987 to develop the site. It
did not disclose the price.

THE Economist Group yesterday announced that it had reached agreement with
Diamond Incorporated to launch jointly a Japanese-language magazine early
next year.
Global Business magazine will be aimed at internationally minded Japanese
business executives. It will have an initial circulation of some 15,000 and
be published every two weeks.
The magazine's content will split three ways. One third will be translations
of articles from The Economist magazine and another third will cover
international business and finance. The final section will focus on domestic
Japanese issues.
Pearson, publisher of the Financial Times, owns 50 per cent of The
Economist.
Mr David Gordon, chief executive of Economist Group, said the main
publishing risk would be shouldered by Diamond, which already publishes
Japanese-language versions of the Harvard Business Review and Fortune
magazine.

FT  03 APR 92 / Branson venture with TV-am wins national licence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INDEPENDENT Music Radio, a joint venture between TV-am and Mr Richard
Branson's Virgin group, has been awarded the second national commercial
radio licence. It was the second-highest bidder.
The Radio Authority, the regulatory body for the commercial radio industry,
yesterday rejected Independent National Broadcasting Company's Pounds
4.01m-a-year bid for the pop music franchise.
The official reason given was that under the terms of the 1990 Broadcasting
Act the authority was not satisfied that INBC would be able to sustain its
service over the length of the licence.
It is believed that consultants' reports for the authority raised doubts
about the viability of INBC's business plan.
A prospectus designed to raise the bulk of INBC's capital was delivered to
the Radio Authority only on Wednesday, the day before the decision on the
licence was due to be taken.
Independent Music Radio, which will broadcast a national pop service with an
emphasis on rock music as well as news bulletins and headlines, now has six
weeks to complete its financial arrangements.
Mr Bruce Gyngell, the 62-year-old chairman of TV-am, was said to be
'delighted' yesterday. Mr Gyngell started his career in radio.
The award to Independent Music Radio, which bid Pounds 1.883m a year, is a
much-needed boost to the commercial breakfast station, which lost its TV
broadcasting licence in last year's competitive tenders and which goes off
the air on December 31.
Mr Gyngell's aim is to use assets of more than Pounds 50m to try to build a
cluster of media investments to keep TV-am alive as a broadcaster. The
company has also bid for the commercial teletext licence.
The first national licence for non-pop music went to Classic FM - also the
second-highest bidder, because the highest bidder could not complete its
financing.
The third and last of the commercial national stations is likely to be
speech-based. No date has yet been set for advertising this licence.
In addition to its bid money, Independent Music Radio will have to pay 4 per
cent of qualifying advertising revenue to the Treasury and an annual licence
fee of Pounds 645,000 to the Radio Authority.

FT  03 APR 92 / Indemnity notice from Lime Street nearly month late
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK and RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LIME STREET Underwriting Agency, the Lloyd's members' agency that went into
liquidation in early March, told its Names it had not renewed its indemnity
insurance nearly one month after the policy had expired, in spite of an
instruction from Lloyd's to do so at once, it emerged yesterday.
Notification came in late July last year, although the policy had lapsed in
June. By then, legal claims for liability by Names against the agency may
have been hindered.
Names managed by Lime Street make up a high proportion of the membership of
large loss-making syndicates such as Gooda Walker 387, which has an
estimated loss of 750 per cent of pledged assets for 1988. Names are
individuals whose assets underwrite insurance at Lloyd's.
A letter sent by Mr David Coleridge, chairman of Lloyd's, to underwriting
agencies on April 11 last year and obtained by the Financial Times says
members' agents should notify their Names 'immediately' if they were not
renewing their errors and omissions (E&amp;O) cover, or doing so on a more
restricted basis.
Lime Street did not send out letters to its Names informing them that it was
not renewing E&amp;O cover until July 22 1991, at which point it told them the
policy had expired on June 30.
A number of Names had already notified Lime Street of potential claims on
the advice of action groups formed by members of some of the worst suffering
syndicates.
Until last year, when Lloyd's relaxed the regulations, E&amp;O insurance was
compulsory for both members' and underwriting agencies.
Directors of Lime Street told creditors at a meeting when the company was
liquidated last month that the delay in notifying them was caused by
continued attempts to obtain cover at affordable premiums, which proved
impossible.
Representatives of Lime Street refuse to give any details of the E&amp;O policy,
arguing that any information might jeopardise payments by the underwriters.
Lime Street's E&amp;O policy is believed to have been written on a 'claims made'
basis, however, which means it will cover only claims notified before the
expiry of the policy.
The notifications from Names by that time are likely to have formed an
important part of the estimate of claims given by Lime Street to its
underwriters.
The statement of affairs presented to creditors at a meeting last month
showed claims totalling about Pounds 21m against the company so far. A
number of others were unquantified because they are dependent on losses that
are not yet known.
It also emerged yesterday that one of the Lime Street directors in the mid
1970s was Mr Frederick Sasse, a Lloyd's underwriter whose syndicate ran up
heavy losses arising from its insurance of properties in US cities.
Mr Sasse was a director of Lime Street Underwriting between 1976 and 1978.
He had been a director of Saturn Insurance, which became Lime Street in
1976, when Mr Robin Kingsley joined the board.

FT  03 APR 92 / Sony Music will run Milton Keynes Bowl
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SONY MUSIC Entertainment, the Japanese-owned recorded music company, is to
take over the running of the Milton Keynes Bowl, the open-air concert venue,
in a deal thought to be worth Pounds 9m.
The Bowl, which has hosted concerts by Queen, Michael Jackson, David Bowie
and U2, was previously run by the Milton Keynes Development Corporation,
which was wound up on Tuesday.
The venue, which was opened in 1979, will be run by a joint venture of Sony
Music and Pace Entertainment, which operates amphitheatres and arts centres
in the US. Sony said it had been granted a five-year lease over the Milton
Keynes Bowl, but it hoped to extend that to 25 years.
Sony Music's UK and US arms will each own a third of the joint venture, with
Pace holding the remaining third.
Sony expects to stage seven concerts every year at the Bowl, which holds up
to 60,000 spectators on grassy banks and standing areas. It will also host
community-related events.
Sony Music said yesterday that it would donate 25p from each ticket sold at
the Bowl to Milton Keynes' community trust.
It will also give a Pounds 5,000 annual scholarship to a local resident to
study event management in the US.
Sony Music was formerly CBS Records. It was acquired in 1988 by Sony, the
Japanese electronics company. Its artists include Bruce Springsteen, George
Michael, Neil Diamond and Bob Dylan.
Sony and Pace jointly run two American entertainment venues. The Milton
Keynes Bowl is their first venture outside the US.

<TEXT>
A SCHEME to compensate depositors who lost savings in the Isle of Man branch
of the Bank of Credit and Commerce International fails to offer the same
rights against the collapsed bank as a similar scheme in mainland Britain,
former BCCI clients said yesterday.
More than 5,000 depositors in the Manx branch of BCCI, which closed with
approximately Pounds 90m on deposit, have been given a warning that a
repayment scheme drawn up by the island's Financial Supervision Commission
might mean less redress for them than for claimants using the UK depositor
protection scheme.
Although the Manx scheme offers the same maximum compensation level offered
on the mainland - Pounds 15,000 - it also asks depositors to transfer to the
scheme manager any rights or claims in respect of BCCI, the liquidation and
the government of Abu Dhabi contribution fund.
The estimated cost of compensation under the island's scheme will be Pounds
21m.
The BCCI Depositors' Protection Association said yesterday that under the UK
protection scheme depositors were asked to relinquish their rights only in
respect of the liquidation and not in respect of the proposed Abu Dhabi
scheme.
The association's legal advisers are investigating the difference between
the Manx and UK schemes, the association said.
Mr Brian Rogers, of Port St Mary, in the Isle of Man, spokesman for the
newly formed committee for depositors in the Isle of Man branch, said the
requirement that the Manx depositors should give up those rights exceeded
any similar requirement imposed on depositors under the UK or Abu Dhabi
schemes.
As the proposed Abu Dhabi scheme is for 10 per cent of amounts on deposit,
depositors of more than Pounds 150,000 might see more from there than from
the Manx scheme. They should therefore not be hasty in signing away their
rights to such a claim.
Mr Jim Noakes, director of the Isle of Man Financial Supervision Commission,
the island's scheme manager, said there was no guarantee that the Abu Dhabi
scheme would go ahead.
It requires a minimum 70 per cent of the depositors, by value of funds, to
waive their rights to claim against persons in Abu Dhabi.
Mr Noakes also said that the requirement in the Manx scheme to waive those
rights was part of the regulations that state, 'existing rights shall vest
in the scheme manager'. The scheme came into being in February last year and
is funded by contributions from island-based banks. A Supreme Court judge in
Kingston, Jamaica, has refused a plea by the Jamaican branch of BCCI to stay
the distribution of its assets until an appeal against a liquidation order
is heard. BCCI Jamaica is a branch of BCCI (Overseas), which is registered
in the Cayman Islands.

THE NUMBER of companies passing into administration and receivership during
the first three months of this year in England, Wales and Scotland held at
the same level as last year, figures from Touche Ross showed yesterday.
Insolvency practitioners were appointed administrators and administrative
receivers to 1,559 companies in January to March 1992 compared with 1,563 in
the same period last year. The analysis is based on appointments published
in the monthly London and Edinburgh Gazettes, the official guides to
appointments.
For March this year the total was 527 companies, down slightly from 574 in
the same month last year. Partners from Coopers &amp; Lybrand were appointed
most often as insolvency practitioners, with 110 of the total.

FT  03 APR 92 / Slight fall in underlying reserves
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN'S gold and foreign currency reserves fell by an underlying Dollars
7m last month, indicating that there was no need for the Bank of England to
support sterling in the European exchange rate mechanism.
The Treasury announced that the overall level of reserves fell in March by
Dollars 445m to Dollars 44.31bn, largely because of repayments of Dollars
437m of borrowings under the exchange cover scheme. The reserves were
revalued to Dollars 45.027bn at the end of last month to reflect changes in
the price of gold and non-dollar currencies during the 1991-92 financial
year.
The slight decrease in the underlying reserves was calculated after the
deduction of Dollars 67m for gold returned by Britain to the central banks
of Lithuania and Estonia and the receipt of Dollars 14m in contributions
from non-combatant countries to Britain's costs in last year's Gulf war.
Without these exceptional transactions the underlying reserves would have
risen by Dollars 46m.

FT  03 APR 92 / Hospital chief wins businesswoman award
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD EVANS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE chief executive of a leading cancer hospital yesterday became the first
candidate from the public sector to win the Veuve Clicquot Businesswoman of
the Year award. She is Miss Phyllis Cunningham of London's Royal Marsden
Hospital.
Miss Cunningham, 54, heads a staff of 2,000 at the hospital's two sites in
west London and Sutton, Surrey. She handles a Pounds 60m annual budget and
is responsible for the hospital's Pounds 25m cancer appeal.
'Businesswoman is not a term I would use of myself, but that is exactly what
I am. I don't think people understand that hospitals manage very large
budgets and very large numbers of staff in probably more diverse and complex
ways than in general business,' she said.
In the past year Miss Cunningham has eliminated a Pounds 2m revenue deficit
without reducing the number of patients treated, and seen the Royal Marsden
become the first National Health Service hospital to win the Queen's Award
for technical achievement.
She became a trainee hospital administrator after graduating from Manchester
Business School in the 1960s and joined the Royal Marsden in 1974.
Mr Marmaduke Hussey, chairman of the Royal Marsden, said: 'Phyllis is
tireless in her dedication to the hospital and its staff.'
Previous award winners have included Ms Anita Roddick of Body Shop, Ms
Debbie Moore of Pineapple dance studios and Ms Sophie Mirman of Sock Shop.

FT  03 APR 92 / Bonuses paid early to avoid Labour tax plans: City's poll
fears seen as cause of payments shift
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE has been a marked increase in the number of companies bringing forward
bonus payments to avoid the possibility of being affected by Labour's
proposed tax increases.
Computer Management Group, which claims to process 10 per cent of the UK's
payroll market, says it has noted a distinct shift in bonus payments across
a broad sector of industry.
Mr John Benson, the group's managing director, said: 'While it is not
uncommon for companies to make bonus payments at this point in the financial
year, the only obvious conclusion that can be drawn from our observations is
that companies are making these payments in the 1991-92 tax year rather than
take the risk of potentially higher rates in the 1992-93 tax year.'
He added that the company's confidentiality clause prohibited him from
naming any of the companies involved.
A number of banks and stockbrokers in the City, which normally award bonuses
in the late spring and early summer, have brought them forward. Smith New
Court, for example, said it had brought forward a proportion of each
person's bonus to avoid the possibility of higher tax under Labour.
The apparent acceptance that Labour might win the election is an
embarrassment to some City firms. As recently as early March, 48 per cent of
Smith New Court's fund manager clients thought the election would lead to an
overall majority for the Tories.
Other city firms that are believed to have brought forward bonuses include
SG Warburg and Robert Fleming.
Indications that bonus payments have increased in the approach to the
general election follow reports from accountants that clients have been
seeking other 'tax-efficient' measures so that they will receive income in
the current financial year.

FT  03 APR 92 / Majority satisfied with NHS, researchers say
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN, Public Policy Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TWO THIRDS of people appear to be satisfied with the way the National Health
Service is run, according to a survey published today by the King's Fund
Institute, the independent health-service think tank. Fewer than a fifth are
dissatisfied.
Researchers from the King's Fund and Glasgow University say the survey,
carried out among 2,165 people in February, shows 87 per cent of patients
satisfied with their general practitioner and only 8 per cent dissatisfied.
NHS hospitals did less well, with 64 per cent satisfied with in-patient
services and 60 per cent with out-patient services.
Three quarters wanted cuts in waiting lists for non-emergency operations. A
reduction in waiting times for appointments with hospital doctors was a
close second.
There was also concern about hospital casualty departments and the general
condition of hospital buildings.
An article published today in the British Medical Journal says evidence from
this and other surveys suggests that public dissatisfaction with the NHS may
have peaked in 1990 and fallen last year.
It says that may reflect people's experience of improved health services but
is more likely to be a result of improved news management by the government
and a softening of its image after the replacement of Mrs Thatcher by Mr
Major.
Provisional waiting-list figures published yesterday by the Department of
Health show the number of patients waiting for hospital treatment for more
than two years fell to 1,640 at the end of March, down from more than 50,000
a year ago. The fall reflects the introduction of the Patient's Charter this
week, guaranteeing a maximum wait of two years for treatment once on a
waiting list.

FT  03 APR 92 / Election 1992: Bookmakers laugh all the way to the poll
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL THOMPSON-NOEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SNUG AS BUGS in silk-lined counting-houses, the bookmakers are coining money
hand-over-fist on the UK election.
With the polls still close, the big three bookmaking companies - Ladbroke,
Coral, William Hill - are forecasting a record national election turnover of
Pounds 6m. There would be a second bonanza if a hung parliament were to
cause a fresh election.
The mystery is why anybody bets in the face of gruesomely cramped odds and
UK betting tax.
In earlier times, bookies used to make sophisticated claims for election
betting - arguing that it was an investment instrument whereby voters
worried by electoral trends could hedge their bets.
This week, no such claims were heard. Election betting is now a workaday
sub-division of 'sports betting' - snooker, golf, soccer, etc  - whose
growth is a counterweight to the slowdown in horse and greyhound betting.
Few punters will grow rich on the election. Yesterday Ladbroke, the market
leader, was offering odds of 4/9 (stake 9 to win four) on Labour winning
most seats, 6/4 on the Conservatives, and 400/1 the Liberal Democrats. Its
odds on a hung parliament were evens, while it quoted 6/4 on Labour winning
an overall majority and 4/1 on the Tories doing likewise.
Labour's odds have shortened dramatically in response to the latest polls.
William Hill said: 'This looks like the turning point of the campaign.' 'The
Tories have got a mountain to climb if these polls are to be believed.'
In truth, the bookies' election odds have nothing to do with psephology, or
even reality. They reflect only one thing: the weight of money cascading
into the counting-houses.
The other beneficiary of election betting will be whoever forms the next
government, for the Treasury will collect a windfall - probably more than
Pounds 1m - in betting tax.
Someone who wagered Pounds 100 with Ladbroke yesterday on Labour winning
most seats was risking Pounds 100 to profit by Pounds 44.44 at odds of 4/9.
But bookmakers are able to deduct 10 per cent from winnings and stakes, to
cover betting tax. So even if Labour wins, the person who bet Pounds 100
yesterday at 4/9 will pay tax of Pounds 14.44, reducing his winnings by 32.5
per cent to Pounds 30. Alternatively, he could elect to pay tax in advance,
but only on his stake. If the bet is lost, then his Pounds 10 is forfeited
as well as his Pounds 100.
Sounds crazy?
However eccentric it sounds, some large bets have been struck on Labour. For
example, a client of William Hill, a Brighton restaurant owner, has bet
Pounds 18,000 on Labour to win just under Pounds 40,000. Over the past two
years, the client placed 11 bets on Labour of Pounds 1,000-Pounds 2,750 at
average odds of a little under 2.22 to 1.
That man was brighter than most pundits and political columnists. But what
about the people accepting William Hill's current odds of only 200/1 on the
Liberal Democrats winning most seats? Weren't they being robbed given that
the true odds against such an outcome were almost certainly in excess of
1m/1?
William Hill was unctuous: 'Our current liability on the Lib Dems is more
than Pounds 500,000. If they win, that's what we'd have to pay out, so we
can't afford to be clever. The Lib Dems have been out to 500/1, but every
time we push the price out, the punters come nibbling. There is a man in
Edgware, apparently, telling everyone to back the Lib Dems and then go and
vote for them. We have got to be careful.'

FT  03 APR 92 / Election 1992: Tories short of doorstep ammunition - Labour
is poised for gains in the west Midlands
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT and RICHARD DONKIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ACROSS the red-brick conurbations of the Midlands, candidates are
confronting a deep mood of austerity that in some cases assumes almost
Dickensian proportions.
A visit to an ordinary household trapped by falling house prices and numbed
by the fresh poll tax demand is a visit to Bleak House. But the worst of
times for Conservatives has been the best of times for Labour.
For the first time in nearly 20 years, Labour is in a position to win
political superiority in the west Midlands. It needs a swing of 10 per cent
across the region to regain the status it had in 1974. Events of the last
two years and the impact of the campaign suggest, however, that the swing is
not so much towards Labour as away from the Conservatives.
Behind the displays of Conservative faith and the fighting talk, the cracks
are showing. The Tory campaign has not gone well. You can see it in the
offices, on the streets and among the party workers. Heads are down and
recriminations are whispered.
Mr David Gilroy Bevan, with a tenuous Conservative hold on Birmingham
Yardley, admits: 'The electorate is not responding because we have not got
the message over sufficiently well to have persuaded people of the real
facts.' Local Labour leaders sense this: at a meeting this week of council
chief executives, the talk was that Labour councillors were beginning to
look smug.
Neither Labour nor the Conservatives have much to fear in the west Midlands
from the Liberal Democrats, whose best chance of winning a seat lies in
Birmingham Yardley. This is not to say that they will fail to pick up votes,
however. They could benefit from election boredom and the distaste for the
bickering of the two main parties - most noticeable during the 'War of
Jennifer's Ear'.
Yet a poll for yesterday's Birmingham Evening Mail gave Labour a strong lead
in Yardley.
The poll, by Quality Fieldwork, gave Labour 40 per cent (up from 36.6 per
cent in 1987), the Conservatives 35 per cent (42.6 per cent) and the Liberal
Democrats 24 per cent.
People feel that they have done everything the Conservative government has
asked. They have rejected the union extremists. They have accepted new
working practices and strike curbs. Yet the bargain has not cut both ways.
There is no job security.
While many in the west Midlands earn more and live better than they did a
decade ago, the region experienced only a brief period of prosperity between
two severe recessions.
The downturn of the early 1980s damaged the manufacturing sector, although
the parts which survived emerged leaner and more resilient. But even during
the short-lived recovery of the mid and late 1980s, the number of
manufacturing jobs continued to decline. This has been offset by the growth
of the services sector, but growth has been curtailed by the current
recession.
The regional economy is still in the throes of adjustment, and the latest
surveys convey the message that any thought of sustained growth can be put
off until next year.
Against this background, it is not surprising that the Conservatives are
short of ammunition on the doorstep. The choice of daily themes from Central
Office seems to bear little resemblance to the realities of life. Concerns
are basic.
'People do not actually ask us what is the theme for today. On one canvass
last week people were more worried about the state of the pavements in the
shopping centre,' says Mrs Sandra Brew, the election agent for Mr Roger
King, defending the Conservative marginal of Birmingham Northfield against
Labour's Mr Richard Burden.
The Tories have made great play of the tax issue. But while the Budget
concessions at the lower end of the tax bracket were handy, they have not
been large enough to have an impact when the main concern is whether the job
will still exist next Monday.
Charges that Labour will tax everybody out of existence have a hollow ring
in a relatively low-wage economy; according to the West Midlands Low Pay
Unit, 45.2 per cent of the region's workforce earn less than a basic Pounds
185 a week.
Moreover, the regional economy is critically dependent on the car industry.
Mr Gilroy Bevan says: 'Suddenly the motor business on which the west
Midlands was founded collapsed. New cars were not selling. Secondhand cars
were not selling and long-lease was not working. I urged the chancellor to
take the whole special levy off in one go. But I was told it would be too
expensive.'
The reduction of the sales tax on new cars from 10 per cent to 5 per cent in
the last Budget may boost sales, but in Mr Gilroy Bevan's view the
concession came too late to make much difference to the election.
If the Conservative campaign has been undermined by recession, Labour's
message has an appealing simplicity. Mr John Cooper, the candidate for Amber
Valley in Derbyshire (now becoming a car county by virtue of Toyota's
presence), delivers a straightforward doorstep message: jobs, health,
education and jobs again, capped by the question: 'Isn't it time for a
change?'
Knowing that the recession has inevitably eroded the Tory vote, Labour has
been chiselling at the cracks. But the bedrock could be stronger than Labour
thinks, for two reasons.
First, the west Midlands has a strong tradition of working-class Toryism.
Its engineering plants tended to be smaller than, say, the vast textile
works which once dominated the north-west and Yorkshire. This produced a
closer relationship between boss and worker, making less relevant the old
shibboleths of the class war.
The second reason relates to little doubt that west Midlanders identify with
a prime minister who did not go to university and knows what it is like to
be out of a job.
How this issue of identification with Mr Major will affect the outcome is
unclear. The campaign revolves around the question of trust: which leader
can best be relied upon to ease, and then cure, the pain of recession?
The parties are getting different answers on the doorstep. The Conservatives
suggest that there is a vast number of uncommitted voters. Labour claims
that its new pin-striped style is attracting Tory voters.
Observation on the ground suggests that Labour is likely to be proved right.
It does not carry the burden of the Tories' recent economic record. However,
its well-tuned campaign machine will have to work hard to get the voters
out.

FT  03 APR 92 / Tec warning on links with government
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SENIOR representative of Training and Enterprise Councils unexpectedly
warned yesterday that the relationship between Tecs and the government must
be addressed as a matter of urgency after the election if Britain is to
achieve its skills revolution.
Mr Edward Roberts, chairman of G10, the group of 10 Tec chairmen, said that
funding levels and the degree of flexibility in government contracts with
them to deliver programmes including Youth Training had to be examined.
Mr Roberts said: 'We still believe implicitly in the Tec idea and we are
progressing towards the goals. But, as with any business, we must be sure
the strategy is right and the delivery is possible. We are concerned that we
may not be able to achieve all the things we want to do. There is a gap
between the vision of a skills revolution and the practicality.'
There was a need, for example, for government pump-priming of the new
Investors in People scheme, which seeks to improve the train-ing of people
in work.
At present Tecs have no funds specifically designated to drive the scheme.
Some Tecs, he said, were also concerned that they might not be able to
maintain the quality of training programmes for young people and the
unemployed.
Tecs generally have been concerned about reductions in government funding
for their programmes this year. Sixteen Tecs have yet to finalise their
contracts with the government for delivering schemes.
The debate over Tecs funding has been joined by the Confederation of British
Industry.
Sir John Banham, CBI director-general, writing in a report by the Policy
Studies Institute, said Tecs may face 'death by a thousand cuts' if they are
not given sufficient funds.
He said: 'Tecs must be given sufficient resources by government to do the
job.'
Labour will today seek to lift the issue of training up the political
agenda. Mr Tony Blair, shadow employment secretary, said the cuts proposed
this year were a scandal.

FT  03 APR 92 / The high cost of bouncing cheques
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE number of bouncing cheques has risen sharply and high-fashion stores are
particularly vulnerable, according to a company that guarantees cheques for
about 37,000 retailers.
The risk of default is nearly twice as high with business cheques as with
personal cheques, Birmingham-based Transax says.
Transax reported yesterday that for every 10,000 cheques covering sums above
the normal bank card guarantee limit of Pounds 50 which passed through the
retail and banking system last year, 67 personal cheques and 114 business
cheques bounced.
Compared with 1990, defaults last year rose 17 per cent for personal cheques
and 9.5 per cent for business cheques. The disparity arises because business
cheque defaults were much higher in 1990 than personal cheque defaults, so
the risk in handling personal cheques rose more quickly last year than that
for business cheques.
Retailers using the Transax service telephone for authority to accept
cheques covering amounts above the bank guarantee limit. Transax then checks
the details against its own database - it has no access to bank files. Once
it gives an authorisation, Transax is bound to see that the retailer is paid
in full and it takes responsibility for recovering the sum written on a
bounced cheque. The average value of its guarantee is Pounds 120 for
personal cheques and Pounds 160 for business cheques.
Of more than 5m cheques covered by a Transax guarantee last year, twice as
many bouncing personal cheques were presented in menswear shops as in cycle
shops. In the business sector, the number of bouncing cheques taken by the
motor and building trades rose by 19 per cent and 23 per cent respectively.
Bouncing cheques are more likely to come from those with personal accounts
at building societies than at clearing banks, the analysis showed.

FT  03 APR 92 / Election 1992: Mellor condemns sell-off 'muddle'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH and PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LABOUR was accused yesterday by Mr David Mellor, chief secretary to the
Treasury, of 'muddle and confusion' over privatisation.
His attack came after Mr John Smith, the shadow chancellor, said that his
party had made 'no decisions' on whether a Labour government would sell the
residual shareholdings in British Telecom and the two electricity generation
companies.
Earlier, Mr Neil Kinnock had said that his party would not stop any of the
sales that were already in the pipeline. That would mean that the same
resources would be available to Labour as the Conservatives next year. But
Mr Mellor called on Mr Kinnock to clarify whether a Labour government would
announce new privatisation schemes on top of those already planned.
His intervention followed a series of Conservative attempts this week - so
far resisted by Labour - to force Mr Kinnock to clarify its projections for
public-sector borrowing over the medium-term.
Mr Mellor suggested that if Labour took power and failed to go ahead with
new privatisation programmes, the public-sector accounts would be a further
Pounds 9bn in deficit over the two financial years starting in April 1993.
Mr Mellor said the Tories planned to gain Pounds 8bn from privatisation in
this financial year, followed by Pounds 5.5bn in both 1993-4 and 1994-5.
If Labour took power, it would obtain the Pounds 8bn due this financial year
from programmes already started, but would gain at most Pounds 2bn for the
subsequent two years, unless it announced new schemes. Mr Mellor said the
Conservatives could achieve their own target for privatisation and called on
Labour to be more specific on its plans.

THE number of City economists forecasting a hung parliament with Labour as
the biggest party has more than doubled in the past week, according to a
Reuter poll last night. The survey, covering 47 economists at London
financial institutions, indicated 72 per cent believed this, compared with
35 per cent last week.
None predicted an outright Tory win, while per cent thought Labour would
form a majority government. A further 8.5 per cent predicted the Tories
would be the biggest party in a hung Parliament.

FT  03 APR 92 / Election 1992: Ashdown seeks to avoid rule by minority
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MODERATE Conservative and Labour voters should deny both Mr John Major and
Mr Neil Kinnock the opportunity to form a minority government after the
election, Mr Paddy Ashdown, the Liberal Democrat leader, said last night,
Ivor Owen writes.
He told a rally in Eastbourne, East Sussex, that neither Mr Major nor Mr
Kinnock would have the right to try to go it alone in a hung parliament, and
that pressure from within the Conservative or Labour party could ensure a
coalition government involving the Liberal Democrats.
Mr Ashdown's speech came after a visit to Cornwall and Devon. There he found
evidence that Mr Major's warning against voting Liberal Democrat because it
might put Mr Kinnock into 10 Downing Street could rebound on the Tories.
There were indications of Conservative candidates fearing that Labour
supporters could interpret the warning as an encouragement to switch to the
Liberal Democrats.
As soon as Mr Ashdown crossed the River Tamar into the Cornwall South East
constituency, Liberal Democrat activists assured him that they were poised
to repeat their February 1974 victory, when a combination of Tory defectors
and tactical voting by Labour supporters defeated Mr Robert Hicks, the
sitting Conservative.
Mr Hicks regained the seat in October 1974 and has held it since, but his
confidence that he will beat off the Liberal Democrats challenge does not
appear to be shared by some of his party workers.
Mr Ashdown, buoyed by recent opinion polls and the response he has received
on his nationwide election tour, told a rally in Eastbourne last night that
a vote to replace Mr Major with Mr Kinnock would not be enough.
He dismissed Labour's slogan 'time for change' and said Mr Kinnock was not
seeking 'real change'.
Mr Ashdown added that a Labour victory would be a return to the old system
with a 'gang of playground bullies' using their strength to grab Buggins'
turn to do whatever they like.

FT  03 APR 92 / Election 1992: Labour's fear of the dreaded 'D-word'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN Mr Neil Kinnock's Labour party it has become known as the 'D-word'. Those
brave or foolish enough to speculate about devaluation within Mr Kinnock's
earshot receive the kind of reception that Mrs Margaret Thatcher once
reserved for friends of European federalism.
His mind has become as closed to the possibility of a post-election
devaluation of the pound as was Mrs Thatcher's to the infamous 'F-word'
which provided the trigger for her downfall as prime minister.
As the election campaign has unfolded, Mr Kinnock has become firmer and
firmer in his public rejection of the notion that a lower exchange rate
might have a part to play in his economic strategy.
Yesterday he underlined again that a Labour government would 'do what is
necessary' to maintain sterling's parity within the European exchange rate
mechanism. What is necessary includes, as a last resort, putting up interest
rates.
The logic behind such statements - echoed daily by Mr John Smith, the shadow
chancellor - is obvious. If Mr Kinnock wins on April 9 it will be because he
has persuaded enough of the electorate that his party has crafted at last a
credible approach to running the economy. To admit that it might contemplate
a fall in the pound's value would undercut decisively any such claim.
Yet as the prospect of a Labour victory has increased, Mr Kinnock's public
pronouncements on sterling have been mirrored by a hardening of his private
thinking.
Colleagues in the shadow cabinet - including those more favourably disposed
to the notion that the pound might be overvalued - believe that Mr Kinnock
in Downing Street would not change his mind. Like Mr Harold Wilson in the
1960s, he has become mesmerised by the notion that devaluation is not an
option for a Labour government. It is a view that has been shaped by a
coincidence of short-term political judgment and of his broader personal
philosophy.
Mr Kinnock conspicuously has not said that he believes that the rate at
which Mr John Major set sterling's value against the D-Mark in October 1990
was the right one. Some of his closest advisers think that DM2.95 was too
high.
But the pragmatism that has persuaded him to reject the possibility in
opposition has convinced Mr Kinnock that he could not devalue once in
office. His argument - shared by Mr Smith - is that even if the exchange
rate was set at too high a level in the ERM in 1990, the costs of
realignment would far outweigh the benefits.
By breaking its pre-election pledge, Labour would undermine immediately its
credibility in financial markets. Instead of allowing a fall in interest
rates, it would force borrowing costs higher, in turn wrecking the party's
long-term programme to encourage investment. It might take years to regain
the markets' trust.
Devaluation would be interpreted also as a sign of weakness by union
negotiators and the newly appointed ministers in Whitehall spending
departments lined up against a Labour chancellor.
It is here that the practicalities fit in with Mr Kinnock's broader
political outlook. The experiences of his party's defeats in 1983 and 1987
have shaped an outlook instinctively repelled by soft options.
His assessment of the past failures of his party, and of previous Labour
governments, is that they were too easily seduced by 'alibis' - an
instinctive preference to avoid taking hard decisions. Mr Kinnock's view is
that devaluation would fit into that category - a temporary but ineffective
and ultimately destructive refuge against economic reality.
If Mr Kinnock wins, the financial markets cannot be guaranteed to take him
at his word. If they demand a rise in interest rates as proof of his
resolution, there will be some in his cabinet who will demand that the
devaluation option is discussed.
He can claim justly that the case for devaluation put in a recently leaked
policy paper by one of Mr Smith's advisers has no official status. Mr Andrew
Graham, the Oxford don, delivered the paper two years ago - before sterling
had been put in the ERM and before the recession.
Even so, its analysis - suggesting that a lower pound and a tighter fiscal
policy would be the most effective way of re-establishing a more competitive
economy - is shared by some of Mr Kinnock's colleagues.
Mr Kinnock could of course follow Mr Wilson's example and forbid debate of
devaluation in his cabinet. The most powerful of his colleagues would
support him. They believe that even it it meant higher interest rates, the
Labour leader would stick to the strategy. Not all, though, would be sure
that it was a price worth paying.

FT  03 APR 92 / Election 1992: CBI chief says Smith's plans could lead to
slump
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LABOUR's plans for a sharp increase in the taxation of individuals earning
more than Pounds 22,000 a year could abort economic recovery and turn the
UK's recession into a slump, Sir John Banham, director-general of the
Confederation of British Industry, warned last night.
Although Sir John took care not to mention Labour by name, his unusually
blunt speech made clear that the party's taxation policies, outlined in Mr
John Smith's shadow Budget, were the object of his attack.
He told business executives in Sheffield that the tax plans proposed by
Labour could result in a further fall for house prices and consumer
confidence. Jobs would be lost throughout the UK as homeowners and taxpayers
cut their spending, 'perhaps by as much as Pounds 20bn', he said.
Sir John, who will soon retire from the CBI, added that proposals for a
national minimum wage 'would rekindle inflation'. Labour's policies would
damage the UK's competitive position and could hinder inward investment.
He warned that CBI members would put their UK investment plans on ice in the
event of Labour's policies being enacted, adding that 'the freeze might be a
long one'.
Shortly before Sir John spoke, a survey of business leaders by COBA, a
management consultancy group, indicated that Labour has failed to win
business support for its economic policies.
In a poll of 100 top executives in industry, banking and commerce, the group
found that 73 per cent thought that their company would be directly affected
by a change of government, compared with 35 per cent when the same sample
was polled in 1990.
After netting out positive responses, COBA said a balance of 49 per cent
expected a change in government would result in falling revenues for their
company, while a net 48 per cent expected to cut employment. On balance,
around four out of 10 executives expected to cut investment plans and become
more risk-averse if the Conservatives lost the election. A net one in four
forecast worse labour relations and indicated that they would consider
shifting some of their operations abroad.
The survey was conducted after the publication of the shadow Budget and
contrasted with COBA's 1990 survey, when the majority of respondents felt
that a change in government would be unlikely to affect their own industry.
In the latest survey most executives interviewed by the consultancy thought
that a Labour government would be bad for the UK economy. A net 81 per cent
of interviewees expected interest rates to rise.

According to Concord Posterlink, the UK's largest specialist outdoor buying

about 500.
In Scotland, the Scottish National party has occupied only 110 sites, but
the other parties have increased their blitz. Of some 3,000 hoardings, more
than 1,000 now display political advertising. Who says the SNP hasn't got

UK managing director of a well-known international computer company has sent

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Should John Major fall under a bus next Thursday, it is said that Kenneth
Clarke would not mind applying for the vacancy.
This week's ICM poll of teachers - his flock as education secretary - won't
exactly boost his chances.
The poll showed that after 18 months of bullying from Clarke, Tory support
among Britain's 450,000 teachers has plummeted to 20 per cent - against 51
per cent for Labour.
In the halcyon days of 1979, polls showed that 45 per cent of the nation's
teachers were behind the Thatcher banner.
'They're voting for a quiet life,' was the characteristically robust
response from the education secretary.

The campaign is testing candidates' ingenuity to its limits, if this flyer

Wimbledon general election quiz with Charles Goodson-Wickes.
'Q1: Which two Johns, in their time, knew the buildings at Rutlish very

'Q2: In which year did Horatio Nelson move to Merton Place?
'Q3: Where is the All England Lawn Tennis Club thinking of moving to, if the
Labour council doesn't help them?
'Q4: How many Liberal councillors are there on Merton Council?'
Quite how asking these questions - to which answers are not provided - will
help Goodson-Wickes is not clear. On the other hand, he should not need much

FT  03 APR 92 / Election 1992: Unions go on holiday - Ballot Box
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The profile of Britain's union leaders in the election campaign has been low
to the point of invisibility. Indeed, some of the leaders of organised
labour have been taking the opportunity to take holidays before, as they
hope, returning to share power with a Labour government.
Bill Jordan, the president of the Amalgamated Engineering Union (AEU), has
just returned from a week in the Canary Islands with
his wife. Meanwhile, a group of 10 senior officials from the AEU, the GMB
general union and the TGWU general union have just set off for a short
golfing holiday in Portugal.
In spite of the TUC's unprecedented forgetfulness about formally endorsing
the Labour party, one or two union leaders have been quietly doing their bit
to get the vote out in their own unions.
John Edmonds, leader of the GMB, Rodney Bickerstaffe, leader of Nupe, the
public services union, and Bill Morris, leader of the TGWU, have been the
most active.
But the leaders of the proudly independent AEU have been behind their desks
working quite normally - at least when they are not on holiday.

FT  03 APR 92 / Election 1992: Kinnock disappoints Lib Dems over PR
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LIBERAL DEMOCRATS made it clear yesterday that the gesture by Mr Neil
Kinnock, the Labour leader, on electoral reform fell short of their demands
for 'fair votes'.
Mr Kinnock announced yesterday that a Labour government would invite other
politicians to join its planned inquiry into electoral reform, as the party
unveiled further details of its programme for constitutional change.
He said that Labour wanted a broad consensus behind any proposals for change
and to allow the British people to express their view, almost certainly via
a general election under the present first-past-the-post system.
In contrast, Mr Paddy Ashdown, Liberal Democrat leader, said he would not
join a coalition government unless there was a commitment to legislation for
proportional representation in the first Queen's Speech of the new
government.
He envisaged agreement on details in time for a bill to be introduced in the
first session of parliament. A referendum would then take place after the
legislation had been approved by MPs but before it came into effect.
Mr Kinnock saw no chance of the party's committee on electoral reform,
chaired by Professor Raymond Plant, reaching a conclusion in time for the
Queen's Speech.
The next interim report from the committee was not expected until the
party's annual conference in the autumn, he said.
Later, Mr Roy Hattersley, Labour's deputy leader, indicated there was little
prospect of any change that might be recommended in the voting system for
Westminster being made in time for the election following the one next week.
Mr Kinnock said the election of a Labour government would give 'extra
authority' to the committee, and other political parties, representatives of
the churches, trade unions and business would be invited to take part.
He declined to give his views on proportional representation, however. 'The
whole purpose of the exercise in the first place was to gain the most
thorough and comprehensive analysis and to make recommendations on the basis
of consensus,' he said.
Asked if he would hold a referendum on any changes, Mr Kinnock replied: 'In
the event of any propositions coming forward of significant change, it is
the British people who will have the power of decisions.'
He added: 'The way that we make decisions of that nature, conventionally in
the British system, is by process of general election. That remains my
preference. It always has been.'
Mr Hattersley set out how Labour would, immediately on coming into office,
require senior government appointments to be examined by all-party
committees in the Commons.
He said Labour would protect individual rights with a comprehensive 'Charter
of Rights' made up of specific acts of parliament. It would cover equal
treatment under, and access to, the law; rights of women; and the rights of
ethnic minorities.
Other Labour proposals for constitutional reform included a Freedom of
Information Act, the replacement of the House of Lords with an elected
second chamber, Scottish and Welsh parliaments, and a review of the criminal
justice system.

FT  03 APR 92 / Election 1992: C2s cheer electoral reform supporters
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT'S the C2s - those semi-skilled workers allegedly flocking to Mr Neil
Kinnock's banner - rather than the chattering classes who are in the
vanguard of the movement for constitutional reform.
So proclaimed Charter 88 yesterday at the launch of its 'Democracy Day'  - a
reform crusade involving more than a hundred meetings of election candidates
in pubs and halls across Britain last night.
Electoral reform, freedom of information and incorporation of the European
Convention on Human Rights into English law may not yet be the talk of the
street over a pint in The Rover's Return, but Charter 88 says it's the C2s
who are keenest to bring down the whole rotten system.
To prove it, Professor David Marquand, very much an A1 from Sheffield
University, appeared at a meeting in London brandishing findings of an NOP
poll, conducted for Charter 88 in the first week of the election campaign.
These revealed that of all social classes, semi-skilled workers were most
dissatisfied with the existing political system.
Asked if they thought Britain's system of government 'could be improved
quite a lot' or 'needs a great deal of improvement', 50 per cent of As and
Bs agreed, 63 per cent of C1s did so, but 75 per cent of C2s assented.
Mr Peter Pulzer, professor of government at Oxford, was convinced
constitutional reform issues would dominate the next parliament. 'This
election is the beginning of the end of unrepresentative and
over-centralised government in the UK,' he said gravely.
It was a line cheered by Mr Graham Mather, erstwhile director of the
Institute of Economic Affairs.
'Supporters of market economics are increasingly recognising that the
advances of the 1980s need to be followed by tackling institutional problems
in the 1990s,' he said.
Nodding vigorously, Ms Beverley Anderson, Charter 88's chairperson, stressed
the number of Tories taking part in last night's debates. Who knows, before
long they might even climb on to soap boxes and start preaching the virtues
of the single transferable vote in multi-member constituencies.

FT  03 APR 92 / Election 1992: Rosie fights a mean time in Greenwich -
Political oblivion stalks south London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ROSIE BARNES momentarily drops her dimpled smile: 'I am not the motherhood,
apple pie and furry rabbit party. The remark was arrogant and condescending
and it will backfire on him.'
Such intemperate asides from Mrs Barnes are rare as she bustles from door to
door in a heroic attempt to defy the political tide and hold on to
Greenwich, the south-east London seat she took for the Social Democratic
party in a 1987 by-election and retained months later in the general
election.
Mrs Barnes was reacting to remarks about her attributed to Mr Nick
Raynsford, who achieved his own by-election victory in Fulham in 1986 but
proved somewhat less adept than his latest opponent in holding on.
Mr Raynsford is trying to regain Greenwich for Labour, backed by a party
machine which has appeared efficient and effective across the capital. Mrs
Barnes has no party behind her, furry rabbit or otherwise, though she has
attracted from around the country the enthusiastic help of those for whom
the flame of social democracy still flickers.
It may not be much comfort to her but she is not entirely alone in London's
84 parliamentary constituencies in pitching herself against the big
battalions of the Labour and Tory parties.
Mr John Cartwright, the other surviving SDP 'mould breaker' is defending
nearby Woolwich while, further west along the Thames, Mr Simon Hughes is
fighting for the Liberal Democrats in Southwark and Bermondsey, held by him
since another famous by-election victory in 1983.
For all three, the outcome of the general election is particularly
uncertain. The psephologists might forecast all three swept away by a
resurgence in the fortunes of a Labour party which once regarded London as
its own; Barnes, Cartwright and Hughes trust it is not quite as simple as
that.
Each will be counting heavily on their ability to muster a significant
personal vote, built on their record as active constituency MPs who have
assiduously carried out local responsibilities.
In Woolwich, John Cartwright is 'the man with time for everyone' who has
lived locally for 30 years, while Mrs Barnes, after 21 years in Greenwich,
has an 'almost intimate' relationship with her constituents. Simon Hughes is
'100 per cent dedicated' to Southwark and 'doesn't just work here - he lives
here]'.
Mrs Barnes may be nearest to the brink of political oblivion. A swing to
Labour of less than 3 per cent will be sufficient to see her off. She
reckons the absence of any party label could knock 10 per cent off her
potential vote but, against that, she is not being opposed by a Liberal
Democrat rival and intends to tap for all it is worth an obvious fund of
goodwill among local voters.
Her posters are everywhere and she is quickly recognised on run-down council
estates once the exclusive preserve of Labour. She appears to have involved
herself in the problems of countless individual voters, whether bed-bound
pensioners or ex-convicts in need of accommodation.
Accordingly, her critics dismiss her as a glorified social worker, a
description she partly accepts, before emphasising the added value of a seat
in the Commons. If she wins, it will be an extraordinary tribute to her
grassroots diligence.
Though an even smaller swing to Labour will dislodge Mr Cartwright in favour
of Mr John Austin-Walker, Labour's candidate, he may have a better chance of
survival. His reputation is high and, like Mrs Barnes, he effectively
capitalises on evident discontent over the record of the local Labour
council, of which Mr Austin-Walker, a race equality officer, is a former
leader.
National issues take second place or are translated into the particular
problems of Woolwich. He accuses the leftwing council of imposing, because
of its ineptitude, crippling increases in the cost of meals and home helps
which will wipe out the benefit of any pension increases pledged by a Labour
party oozing moderation at national level.
While Mr Austin-Walker concentrates on unemployment, training and education,
Mr Cartwright complains of dirty pavements, closed libraries and swimming
pools and calls on 'wise Tories' to back him in a seat which the
Conservatives have not won in more than 70 years. He has the personal
endorsement of Dr David Owen, the former SDP leader - not necessarily a
helpful gesture - and could take the Liberal Democrat whip in the Commons if
he wins again.
In Southwark, Mr Hughes mixes a careful blend of parochial and parliamentary
issues. He is portrayed both as the caring, local boy with more than 10,000
cases on his books and as a politician with a national profile gained by the
demands put upon individual MPs in a small Westminster party. Mr Paddy
Ashdown, his leader, has been seen in the constituency more than once.
He holds a majority of 2,779 over Labour, represented by Mr Richard Balfe,
the MEP and former leading light in the old Greater London Council who once
sought selection in Greenwich. Mr Hughes, too, is exploiting disenchantment
with the Labour council and fights on issues such as street lighting and
pensioners' bus passes, while simultaneously pushing the party line on
national issues. The biggest issue, according to a constituency worker, is
'housing, housing and housing'.
Mr Hughes should survive, though all three London candidates defending seats
not already claimed by the two main parties at least face the possibility of
seeing years of constituency work come to naught in the wake of national
forces beyond their control.
All will hope that the capital is big enough to give them another crack of
the whip.

FT  03 APR 92 / Election 1992: Nuclear stand was 'error of judgment'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR NEIL KINNOCK last night candidly admitted to errors of judgment in his
support for unilateral nuclear disarmament and failure to campaign to change
Labour's policy on the European Community after the 1975 referendum.
His admission, in an ITV interview with Sir Robin Day, came after the Labour
leader denied that his readiness for an all-party commission on electoral
reform was an 'open door' to a pact with the Liberal Democrats.
Looking confident and relaxed, Mr Kinnock said he had believed unilateral
disarmament was the only means of breaking the 'log jam' in the build-up of
nuclear weapons. On reflection this 'may have been an error of judgment'.
On the EC, Mr Kinnock said that in retrospect he believed Labour should have
accepted the verdict of the 1975 plebiscite which overwhelmingly supported
continued British EC membership. But he added that he was guided by the
principle of collective responsibility which precluded him from publicly
opposing the party.
In the event he changed his own position shortly before the 1983 election
and made his views known afterwards. 'Such was the turmoil and the weakness
in my party, to which I owe a duty, I wasn't going to inflict an additional
burden,' he said.
Questioned on devolution, Mr Kinnock denied that he had opposed the move on
principle, but only in the form proposed by the Callaghan government's
referendum in 1978.
He also strongly defended Labour's tax and national insurance plans, set to
raise total deductions for top payers to 59 per cent.

FT  03 APR 92 / Election 1992: Approaches to the future from opposite poles
 -The Issues, Energy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ENTIRE government departments are seldom at risk during elections. But the
Department of Energy's future depends on next week's poll.
The Tories have threatened to wind the department up for good and all if
they win, believing it has outlived its usefulness. Labour will keep the
department because they think there is still much to be done on the energy
front.
This shows how far apart the main parties are on energy. The Tories are
committed to creating a free market in power and fuel which will remove any
need for a central bureaucracy.
They have handed the gas and electricity industries over to Sid. If they
survive to see through their planned early sell-off of British Coal, all
that will be left in state ownership is the nuclear power industry, which is
due for review in 1994.
But the story is not as close to its end as the Tories suggest. Recently
there has been growing reaction to the consequences of privatisation, in
particular the near-monopolies in power generation and gas and the strong
influence they have on energy prices.
A future Tory government could face pressure to break these organisations up
further. Allied to this is the question of whether the regulators are
proving effective enough in keeping the utilities up to the mark. The Tories
are promising to attack anti-competitive behaviour 'with vigour' and
introduce new legislation to deal with cartels.
Labour intends to take a more interventionist line. Much of its policy is
based on the party's commitment to saving the coal industry which it sees
playing a key role in a national energy policy.
This would mean guaranteeing a price for coal supplies and banning coal
imports, which would save jobs but might also entail higher electricity
bills. Although Labour has given up any idea of renationalising the
electricity industry it would 'restore public control' of National Grid in
order to reassert government power over electricity supplies.
But it is not clear quite what this means. Mr Frank Dobson, Labour's energy
spokesman, seems to have backed off from a commitment to renationalise the
grid.
Labour would try to husband North Sea oil and gas reserves by measures to
encourage more efficient recovery from undersea wells, and put a brake on
the 'dash for gas' which is leading to the construction of a wave of
possibly unnecessary gas-fired stations.
One of the biggest areas of uncertainty is nuclear power. The Tories are
being cautiously non-committal. Their manifesto stresses 'safe and
economical nuclear power', with safeguards for the management of nuclear
waste.
Labour would complete the one nuclear station still under construction -
Sizewell B in Suffolk - but would build no more and would allow the industry
to wither away.
The Liberal Democrats take the strongest line. They would stop Sizewell
immediately and phase out all nuclear power by 2020. They also support
proposals for an EC energy tax - something that neither the Tories nor
Labour are keen on. If the Lib Dems got the energy portfolio in a coalition
government they could have quite an impact.
Whichever party wins, we shall be hearing much more about energy efficiency,
both to save fuel and to spare the environment. The Tories will set up an
independent energy savings trust to promote energy efficiency, and there may
also be new building regulations to improve energy use.
Labour goes one better: it will set up two new agencies, one for energy
efficiency, one for renewable energy. But it will also require gas and
electricity companies to play a leading role in promoting insulation and
energy saving.

FT  03 APR 92 / Election 1992: Nationalists strive for elusive final
breakthrough - The SNP is stuck at around 27% in the polls
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON and BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR ALEX Salmond, leader of the Scottish National party, yesterday came close
to admitting that the party is unlikely to succeed in its aim of winning a
majority of seats in Scotland.
'When you are in a race you conduct yourself on the basis that you are going
to win,' he said. 'But I fully concede that it would be a substantial task
to obtain and sustain a mandate for independence over the next week.'
The SNP is stuck in the opinion polls at around the 27 per cent mark which
it reached and slightly exceeded in early February. To win the election in
Scotland and take 37 of the 72 Scottish seats, it needs about 40 per cent of
the vote.
Last night Mr Salmond welcomed a poll which suggested SNP support had
reached 31 per cent, but this was dismissed by other parties as being out of
line. The poll was carried out by Market Research Scotland and commissioned
by the Aberdeen Press and Journal and Grampian Television.
According to most polls, the party may add about half a dozen seats to the
five it already holds (one of which, Dunfermline West, came to the SNP with
the defection of a Labour MP and looks likely to return to Labour).
Yet the likely tally of seats belittles the party's achievement. The SNP
could match its performance of October 1974, when it won 11 seats with 30
per cent of the vote. It has doubled in popularity since the 1987 election,
when it had only 14 per cent of the vote and took three seats. That rose to
four when Mr Jim Sillars won Glasgow Govan from Labour in a by-election in
1988.
Although it has policies on virtually everything, the SNP's first aim is
independence.
This means it can often command a degree of commitment among large numbers
of sympathisers which in other parties would only be expected from regular
party workers. Sometimes the SNP resembles a covert resistance movement:
people in senior positions confess in private to helping the party, but are
unwilling to be identified publicly with it.
This election is crucial for the SNP. The main issue in Scotland is the
country's constitutional future - and the SNP believes it offers the best
chance in a generation of Scotland winning independence.
Since 1987 the SNP has carefully laid the foundations for success. It
adopted the policy of seeking independence as a member of the European
Community, which reassured those who believed it wanted Scotland to sail off
into isolation.
Its leaders, Mr Salmond and Mr Sillars, are highly able and, in the case of
the latter, almost charismatic. It has abandoned any association with
'tartan and haggis' nationalism, and talks mainly about economics. Above
all, it offers a reasonably clear message.
If the SNP wins a majority in Scotland, it will claim its mandate to
negotiate independence from London, then put the terms to a referendum. It
would then hold elections under proportional representation to the new
Scottish parliament and would hope to win.
But the SNP campaigns simultaneously on its independence platform and on the
policies it would implement if elected to run Scotland. It would withdraw
from the Trident nuclear weapons programme and inject Pounds 9.8bn of public
spending into the Scottish economy over four years to get unemployment down
from 9 per cent to zero.
The main aim is to attract the Labour-voting working class in the industrial
central belt. Somehow the party manages to finesse the fact that these
policies are not tailored for its supporters in rural north-east Scotland,
where three of its five seats are and where its main opponents are Tories or
Liberal Democrats.
To an extent the strategy is working. The SNP has strong support among the
young, cemented by several Scottish rock stars such as Pat Kane of the group
Hue and Cry. Actor Sean Connery has done voice-overs for election
broadcasts.
In the posh Glasgow constituency of Hillhead, held by Mr Roy (now Lord)
Jenkins before he lost it to Labour in 1987, a System Three poll this week
showed SNP support up from 6 per cent in 1987 to 22 per cent.
But though the party says 'no Labour seat is safe', Labour's majorities
still look too big for the SNP to scale. There is a disappointing gap
between the SNP's 27 per cent in the polls and the 35 per cent who back
independence, suggesting that independence supporters back Labour or the
Liberal Democrats.
The SNP still nurses hopes that the Tories may look set to win the election
in Britain and trigger a last minute flight of Labour voters. It hopes to
win urban Labour seats such as Kilmarnock, Paisley, Motherwell South and
Clackmannan, as well as Dundee East, which it lost in 1987. But its best
hopes lie in taking three Tory-held rural seats, including that of Mr Ian
Lang, the Scottish secretary, in Galloway; and in wresting Argyll &amp; Bute
from the Liberal Democrats.
THE Scottish Liberal Democrats yesterday launched a manifesto for business,
claiming that they were the only party which offered a stable environment
for business in Scotland, Bethan Hutton writes.
The manifesto will be circulated to 2,000 businesses and invites them to
'imagine a business climate governed not by political expedience but by
common sense.'
Recent surveys have shown most Scottish businesses to be opposed to
constitutional change, but Mr Malcolm Bruce, the leader of the Scottish
Liberal Democrats, said businesses should realise that the status quo was
'no longer an option'.
Opinion polls show the Liberal Democrat vote slipping in Scotland, but Mr
Bruce said that polls had put the party in a similar position before the
1991 Kincardine and Deeside by-election, which the Liberal Democrats won
with a record swing.

FT  03 APR 92 / Election 1992: Outcome crucial for British Coal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIET SYCHRAVA
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE election will affect British Coal more than almost any other UK company.
Under the Tories, it will be privatised, and might eventually shrink to
nearly half its present size. Under Labour it would be a public company, and
the bulk of its pits would stay open.
'If we are elected,' says Mr Frank Dobson, the shadow energy secretary, 'we
would immediately stop any move to privatise British Coal, and reverse any
moves designed simply for privatisation.'
Labour would also protect British Coal's markets by a moratorium on building
new gas-fired power stations, to force the electricity industry, British
Coal's main customer, to keep buying coal.
Labour would further protect British Coal by restricting imports of foreign
coal.
The Conservatives welcome competition from gas and imported coal because it
will put pressure on British Coal prices, and thus on electricity prices.
If a Conservative government is returned, National Power and PowerGen, the
generating companies, will probably announce plans to increase coal imports
by building new terminals capable of handling around 40m tonnes by the mid
90s.
Whoever wins on April 9 will oversee the contract negotiations which will
determine how much coal British Coal sells to the electricity industry.
A Tory government would be more likely to influence British Coal to drop
prices and tonnage sales to the generators, and to sign a one-year contract
rather than the long-term agreement the company would like and would get
under Labour.

FT  03 APR 92 / Election 1992: Major warns of threat to economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE STEEP fall in share prices that followed opinion polls indicating a
strong Labour lead was used by Mr John Major yesterday to underline his
warning that the economic consequences of a Labour administration would be
calamitous.
'One rogue poll, a glimmer of thought that there might be a Labour
government', and Pounds 1.3bn was wiped off share prices, he told Tory
supporters in south London.
He insisted that the recovery had begun, and that only the the possibility
of a Labour win would stop it.
There was, he said in a radio interview, 'clear anecdotal evidence, clear
survey evidence', that the recovery had started, and he warned that Labour's
readiness to contemplate inflation at the European average - currently 4.6
per cent compared with the UK's rate of 4.1 per cent - would add Pounds 2
1/2 bn to the costs of industry.
Earlier, the Tory campaign had suffered a further jolt with the remarkable
absence of Sir David English, the editor of the Daily Mail, from Mr Major's
visit to the Daily Mail Ideal Home Exhibition.
Tory supporters were clearly taken aback by Sir David's non-appearance. He
had been top of the list of invited guests, and party aides had said he
would be present to greet Mr Major. A statement from Sir David's office said
he had not been informed of the visit.
His non-attendance follows an editorial last Saturday that was severely
critical of the Tory campaign, although the newspaper has been one of the
party's most effective supporters.
The editorial commented that the prime minister and his team had just 11
days left to 'raise their game', and make clear to voters the choice between
sound Conservative economic policies and Labour. 'If they do not do so, they
will lose and they will deserve to lose,' it said.
Sir David's statement said that Mr Major's visit had been arranged at the
last moment for security reasons, and that information about it was kept
strictly to Angex, the company organising the exhibition. 'He is, in fact,
seeing the prime minister this week for a lengthy interview,' the statement
ended.
The apparent tensions in the relationship between the Tories and the Mail
come after the row about the Labour political broadcast on health last week,
when Tory central office gave only to the Daily Express, the Mail's
middle-market rival, the name of the consultant in the case.
In the afternoon, people who were able to 'Meet John Major' at an informal
question and answer session in Tooting, south London, heard the prime
minister warn that 'Labour can damage your wealth'.
He contrasted the rise in living standards for the person on average
earnings, taking account of inflation, under the Labour government of
1974-79 - by just Pounds 2 a week - with the rise of Pounds 68 a week since
1979.

FT  03 APR 92 / Tighter rules for foreign banks in US
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN FRIEDMAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE FEDERAL Reserve Board, acting to tighten regulations in order to prevent
another scandal similar to the Bank of Credit and Commerce International
(BCCI) affair, yesterday put into effect a series of tough new rules to
govern foreign banks operating in the US.
The new rules, which will require a foreign bank to prove to the Federal
Reserve that it is subject to comprehensive supervision by a regulator in
its home country, stem from the passage last December of the Foreign Bank
Supervision Enhancement Act, part of the banking reform legislation approved
by the Congress.
A spokesman for the Fed said the new rules were proposed last year to
correct regulatory gaps that became evident as a result of two banking
scandals. These were the BCCI affair - where the Abu Dhabi-owned bank
engaged in fraud in the US - and the separate scandal about the making of
more than Dollars 4bn of improper Iraqi loans by the Atlanta, Georgia,
branch of Italy's Banca Nazionale del Lavoro.
The rules give the Fed the authority - for the first time - to decide which
foreign banks can set up branches and representative offices in the US.
During 60 days from today, the Fed will receive comments on the rules but
the regulations take effect immediately and are unlikely to be changed in
any substantial way.
Specific provisions call for any foreign bank entering the US market to
prove to the Fed the extent to which its home country central bank is
assured it has adequate procedures for monitoring international banking
activities.
The rules also require home-country supervisors to monitor relations among
foreign bank affiliates in the US and to receive regular consolidated
financial reports that permit analysis of the bank world-wide.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE White House yesterday issued new regulations to ease lending conditions
for real estate and to let 'well-capitalised' savings and loan institutions
open branches in any US state.
The Bush administration acted after both Democrats and Republicans in the
House of Representatives had defied their leaders late on Wednesday by
failing to approve Dollars 17bn in funding to liquidate bankrupt savings and
loans bodies (known as thrifts) and pay off their depositors.
The White House said the country 'can no longer afford to wait for Congress
to act' on proposed legislation to allow inter-state branches. It claimed
the authority to act unilaterally and said its moves would 'enhance the
ability of banks and thrifts to make loans.'
Under the new rules, the amount of capital that banks and thrifts must hold
'against conservatively underwritten loans for construction of pre-sold
homes' is reduced. Also, the threshold for requiring licensed appraisals on
loans secured by real estate is raised from Dollars 50,000 to Dollars
100,000.
Mr Michael Waldman, director of Congress Watch, a citizens' group, said:
'The White House is using the regulatory apparatus as an arm of the campaign
committee and the result will be huge tax-payer costs. It's a little
injection of extra debt and looseness which makes you feel great at first,
then there is a hangover.'

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US PROSECUTORS yesterday achieved the most important Mafia conviction since
that of Al Capone in the 1930s, when a jury of 12 brave New Yorkers found
John Gotti guilty on murder and other charges.
The 51-year-old reputed leader of the biggest organised crime family in
America smiled confidently at the jury as it convicted him for having
ordered the 1985 assassination of his predecessor as head of New York's
Gambino clan.
Gotti, known as 'the Teflon Don' because he had escaped conviction in three
previous trials, was also found guilty of racketeering, illegal gambling,
loan sharking and obstruction of justice.
The Armani-clad mobster was convicted after a two-month trial interrupted by
three bomb threats, and shouting matches between defence lawyers and the
judge.
The most dramatic moment in the Brooklyn trial came last month when Mr
Salvatore 'Sammy the Bull' Gravano, identified by federal officials as Mr
Gotti's second-in-command, described in chilling detail how he and his boss
had spent ten months plotting the assassination of Paul Castellano, the
former Gambino leader.
'John was the boss. I was the underboss. I helped John run the family,' Mr
Gravano explained, having turned state's witness.
Also engaging was the courtroom playing of a clandestine tape-recording made
by the FBI, in which the voice of Gotti was heard speaking of Castellano and
telling his cronies: 'He's gonna die ..'
Gotti, who sarcastically blew kisses at the prosecutor during the trial, was
also accused of having tampered with jurors in previous trials.
Midway through the trial, the foreman of a jury that acquitted Mr Gotti in
1987 was indicted on charges that he accepted Dollars 60,000 from the Gotti
organisation to sell his vote and influence the jury.

NEW ORDERS for manufactured goods in the US rose by 0.5 per cent in February

Shipments of goods were up 2.1 per cent - the 10th increase in the past 11

Inventories - stocks of unsold goods - fell for the fifth month, dropping to
their lowest level for three years.
This suggested that companies will have to increase production so as to meet

<TEXT>
ARGENTINA yesterday commemorated the 10th anniversary of its invasion of the
Falkland Islands with a series of public events which, although low-key,
carried political tension.
President Carlos Menem cancelled plans to attend a military parade,
apparently for fear of being jeered by pro-military right wingers. He chose
to attend Mass at the national shrine of Lujan. However, former combatants
invited to join the president boycotted the service, claiming he was using
it for political purposes.
The bishop officiating at Mass said the invasion was to 'safeguard
constitutional order.' Mr Menem said: 'Today is a day of reflection and
homage to all those who fell defending national territory.'
The only military parade was held in the Patagonian city of Ro Gallegos,
2,100 km south of Buenos Aires and on the same latitude as Port Stanley, the
Falklands capital. There, Mr Antonio Gonzalez, defence minister, said
Argentina would eventually win sovereignty over the islands through
'tireless diplomatic efforts.'
Meanwhile, the UK embassy in Buenos Aires denied that the islands'
government would issue seismic survey licences for oil exploration, as
announced by the chief executive of the Falklands government this week.
'The British government is committed to giving no surprises and intends to
stick to this,' an official said.
The islands have legislation enabling them to market exploration licences,
but rules are still being studied in London and will only be enacted after
consultation with Argentina.

<TEXT>
ISRAEL and its Arab neighbours have agreed to hold a fifth round of peace
talks in Washington on April 27. It appears they may then hold future talks
closer to the Middle East, as demanded by Israel.
The US State Department confirmed plans for the fifth stage in the peace
process last night after representatives of Lebanon, Syria, Jordan and the
Palestine Liberation Organisation had given the go-ahead at a meeting in
Beirut.
The State Department said all parties had responded to a US request to
present a list of potential sites for a sixth round outside Washington.
There was 'some commonality' in the lists, it said, and as a result, the
sixth round 'will be held in a venue closer to the region.'
This appeared to be a breakthrough after months of squabbling about the best
site to continue talks. Israel wants them in the Middle East to gain greater
Arab recognition, but the Arabs have wanted to stay in Washington to
maximise USinvolvement.
In the end, they are likely to settle on a European city.
The Arab representatives meeting in Beirut agreed to attend the fifth round
of talks despite Syrian and Lebanese reservations about continuing
negotiations before Israeli elections on June 23. Officials said delegates
wanted 'to prove to the international community that obstacles are being
raised by Israel, not the Arabs'.
Representatives of Portugal, Britain and the Netherlands - the 'troika' of
the immediate past, present and future presidents of the European Community
 -met the Arab delegates in an unsuccessful attempt to convince Syria and
Lebanon to join multilateral Arab-Israeli talks on economic development,
refugees, water resources and the environment in May.
Syria and Lebanon had boycotted the first round of the multilateral talks
held in Moscow.

FT  03 APR 92 / US clears Israel of selling Patriot secrets to China
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON, JERUSALEM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US yesterday issued Israel 'a clean bill of health' on charges that it
had transferred Patriot missile technology to China.
But Ms Margaret Tutwiler, the state department spokesman, refused to address
allegations in a department report on Wednesday that an unnamed country -
widely assumed to be Israel - had engaged in 'a systematic and growing
pattern' of unauthorisied sales of sensitive US military technologies to
third countries.
The two sets of charges must be treated separately, Ms Tutwiler said.
The allegations have worsened relations between the US and Israel, already
at odds over the US refusal to provide loan guarantees unless the Israelis
stop building new settlements in occupied Arab territories.
The alleged transfer of Patriot technology came to light in a leaked
intelligence report. Mr Dick Cheney, defence secretary, said he had 'good
reason' to be-lieve the report.
But Ms Tutwiler said a 17-member team sent to Israel to investigate the
matter had 'found no evidence that Israel had transferred a Patriot missile
or Patriot missile technology.'
The separate charges of numerous violations of US export controls were
contained in a report issued on Wednesday by the State Department's
inspector general, Mr Sherman Funk. He contended that there had been 'a
systematic and growing pattern' of unauthorised sales of a major recipient
of US military assistance.
He did not refer specifically to Israel, but administration officials
acknowledged privately that it was Israel. It was suggested that the two
major recipients of the arms were South Africa and China.
The investigation of the Patriot transfer was 'a stand-alone, separate
mission' which must not be confused with the inspector general's report, Ms
Tutwiler said.
The Bush administration has been admonished by Mr Bill Clinton - the leading
contender for the Democratic party's presidential nomination - for
'browbeating' Israel over its settlements policy. As a result, the arms
transfer controversy has been handled very gingerly.
In Jerusalem earlier, Israel repeated its denial that it had sold US arms
and technology to countries such as China and South Africa in the face of US
and international prohibitions.
Israeli officials continued to demand a public retraction of allegations by
the US. 'Our policy is to adhere strictly to the procurements and technology
transfer agreements,' said Mr Danny Naveh, spokesman for Mr Moshe Arens, the
defence minister.
The Israeli government is bracing itself for much tougher scrutiny of US
arms and technology transfers, on which the Israeli defence forces and
military industries have come to depend. The military is worried it may
become subject to sanctions on some technologies to which it wants access to
maintain Israel's 'qualitative edge' over its Arab foes.
Despite the official denials, the US moves have forced Israel to be somewhat
more open about its secretive military exports.

CHANCELLOR Helmut Kohl of Germany refused to back down yesterday in his
confrontation with Turkey, insisting that German weapons supplied to its
Nato ally can only be used for its defence 'in the framework of the
alliance'.
Although he stopped short of direct criticism of Turkey's campaign against
Kurdish guerrillas and civilians, which caused Germany to suspend all arms
shipments last week, he said that Ankara must observe all its commitments to
human and minority rights.
In a parliamentary debate on the row between the two normally close allies,
Mr Kohl sought to turn the debacle to belated electoral advantage. With an
eye on the state elections in Baden-Wurttemberg and Schleswig-Holstein on
Sunday, the chancellor delivered a ringing defence of his government's
foreign policy.
But Mr Hans-Ulrich Klose, the SPD parliamentary leader, taunted Mr Kohl for
allowing the row to get out of hand. He said that Mr Dick Cheney, the US
defence secretary, had been forced to intervene between the Nato partners.
'We have reached a sorry state when our big brother in the alliance, the US,
must help us to return to the path of foreign policy virtue,' he said.
The number of foreigners seeking political asylum in Germany reached a
record of more than 35,000 last month, with refugees from Yugoslavia alone
running at 13,175. Romania was the second largest source, with 5,544 and
Turkey third with 2,406.
Turkey is to introduce economic reforms for the impoverished Kurdish
minority after unrest in the area in which more than 100 have died in the
past 10 days, writes John Murray Brown in Ankara.
The measures represent the first concrete steps to address the Kurdish
problem and stem growing support for the Syrian backed Kurdish Workers Party
which is fighting an eight year campaign for independence.

FT  03 APR 92 / Attali issues warning over CIS prospects

THE industrial west must open up to exports from the former Soviet Union,
and must commit substantial extra funds to reconstruction if upheavals are
to be avoided which could escalate into civil wars across Europe, Mr Jacques
Attali, head of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, warned
yesterday.
He predicted at a conference in Paris on world trade and investment that the
Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) faced the prospect of 50m
unemployed, a balance of payments deficit of Dollars 40bn (Pounds 23.1bn) in
1993, failure to fund national budgets, and a crumbling of the state system.
Noting a 20 per cent plunge in exports from the CIS, and a 30 per cent fall
in output over the past year, he warned: 'We have not touched the bottom of
the recession. This is merely the first stage of a major decline in foreign
trade, and a considerable worsening of their growth capacity.
'Eastern Europe has emerged towards civil war, dragging the whole of Europe
towards civil war,' Mr Attali said. 'The dangers are huge.'
In a speech that is likely to preview statements at the first annual meeting
of the EBRD in Bucharest at the weekend, he called for a four-pronged effort
to tackle the region's financial problems, of which the Group of Seven's
pledges on Wednesday of Dollars 24bn in aid to Russia would form just a
part:
Funds for commercial investment, led by EBRD itself, with funds of Ecu10bn
(Pounds 7.15bn) that can be expected to attract private sector investment of
up to Ecu50bn.
Funds for industrial training as industries are rebuilt.
Balance of payments support. This amounted to Dollars 20bn in 1991 in Russia
alone, he said. By 1993, it would amount to Dollars 40bn in the absence of
funds to aid structural change.
Long-term funding for restructuring the system. He foresaw the need for up
to Ecu500bn to fund closure of factories across the CIS, and the building of
new industries. Closure of 16 dangerous nuclear power stations, and the
refurbishment of 45, would in itself cost Ecu10bn.
Mr Attali attacked western countries for pressuring states in eastern Europe
into radical reform while refusing to open markets to their exports. He
called on the EC to move promptly to negotiate a 'contractual common market
with 40 countries across Europe'.

East German companies controlled by the Treuhand agency have suffered a
steep fall in orders from both east and west, which will make the agency's
privatisation programme more difficult, writes Leslie Colitt in Berlin.
Mrs Birgit Breuel, the Treuhand president, blamed west German companies for
spreading rumours of the imminent collapse of their east German competitors
to prevent them getting orders.
