<TEXT>
WALT DISNEY, the Hollywood studio and theme park group, has agreed to swap a
Los Angeles television station it owns for 45 per cent of Pinelands, the New
Jersey holding vehicle of a leading New York independent television
sta-tion.
The transaction calls for Disney to sell the Los Angeles-based KCAL-TV to
Pinelands in a deal estimated to be worth Dollars 200m.
Pinelands, which controls New York's WWOR-TV station, was previously owned
by MCA, the Hollywood entertainment group that was acquired by Matsushita of
Japan.
Matsushita was required to spin off Pinelands 15 months ago because US
regulations prohibit foreign ownership of US television inter-ests.
The Disney-Pinelands deal may yet run into obstacles since it is being
opposed by Mr Mario Gabelli, the New York money manager whose company owns
12 per cent of Pinelands. Mr Gabelli complained that the transaction
undervalued Pinelands.

<TEXT>
FIRST CITY Bancorporation, the troubled Texas bank which has been seeking a
buyer for months, said yesterday that several potential buyers were looking
over its books.
It also gave details of a plan for structuring any takeover and
recapitalisation in a way which, it claimed, should mean no loss for the
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the government agency which oversees
the restructuring of troubled banks.
The FDIC provided nearly Dollars 1bn of a Dollars 1.5bn rescue package for
First City in 1987 and is anxious to avoid a second large cash injection in
such a short time.
First City Bancorporation is one of the largest remaining independent banks
in Texas under local ownership. Mr Robert Abboud, the Chicago banker who led
the 1987 bail-out, resigned as chairman a year ago in the face of mounting
loan losses.
The bank said in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission that
it expected an operating loss in the first quarter and losses were expected
to continue until a deal was struck which restored its capital adequacy.
Without such a deal, the management believed that 'substantial doubt exists
as to the ability of First City to continue as a going concern'.
The proposed deal would involve First City's non-performing and doubtful
loans being put into a separate pool, managed by the buyer. The buyer would
also have the senior interest in the pool, which would be partially
guaranteed by the FDIC. The agency would receive a fee in the form of an
interest in the pool.
First City's shareholders would get a residual interest in the pool in
exchange for their shares.
At the end of last year, some Dollars 670m of the bank's Dollars 5.5bn loan
portfolio was non-performing.

CATERPILLAR, the world's largest maker of earth-moving equipment and a
manufacturer of heavy-duty engines, signed an agreement yesterday to provide
engines for railway locomotives made by Morrison Knudsen, a large
engineering, construction and manufacturing group.
In its first step into the rail market, Caterpillar will provide engines for
shunting, commuter and freight locomotives that will be built by Morrison
Knudsen.
The total North American locomotive market is estimated at some 400 to 500
units annually, with prices ranging from Dollars 1.5m to Dollars 2m each.
While General Electric and General Motors dominate the market now, officials
of both companies believe that the prospects for their new products are
good.
They expect demand for locomotives to increase during the 1990s and believe
they have the new products that will respond to changes in the industry.

<TEXT>
GECHEM, the Belgian chemical group and foam rubber maker, yesterday
announced a 1991 loss of BFr1.9bn (Dollars 55m), largely as a result of
ill-fated expansion in the US, and said it would pay no dividend. This
compares with a BFr1.29bn profit in 1990, writes David Buchan in Brussels.
The loss was slightly greater than Gechem signalled last December when it
announced it was abandoning control of Foamex LP in the US, and with it the
ambition to be the world leader in polyurethane foam rubber.
The news had little impact on the Brussels bourse, where Gechem ordinary
shares closed 2 per cent down but its preferences shares 1 per cent up.
Gechem's strategy is now to focus on Europe, where its foam-making division,
Reticel, recorded a before-tax profit of BFr960m last year on turnover which
increased by 3.2 per cent to BFr28.8bn. This was partly due to recent
acquisitions in the UK, Austria and eastern Germany.

SEARS, ROEBUCK, the large US retail and financial services company,
announced that it will eliminate 2,000 management and clerical jobs by early
1993 to produce cost savings of Dollars 30m this year and Dollars 80m
annually thereafter. About half of these jobs are based in Chicago.
The cuts follow a Sears study of competitors' headquarters. Sears, which has
cut more than 40,000 jobs during the past 20 months, has been on a drive to
curtail its expenses, regarded as relatively high in the retail industry.
The jobs to be phased out this year include posts in buying, replenishment,
marketing, finance, human resources and administration departments.
In addition, Sears announced that 3,200 sales associates have accepted a
severance scheme as a result of its new compensation policy. The policy,
expected to bring an annual cost savings of Dollars 60m, was designed to
weed out less productive salespeople.
In mid-February Sears set new sales commission standards and said that those
whose commission fell by 10 per cent or more as a result of the new
standardisation would be eligible for severance. Details of the severance
costs were not available. Some 650 of these positions will be eliminated.

ACCOR, the French hotels group which recently took over its competitor,
Wagons-Lits, saw net profits fall by 5.6 per cent from FFr1bn in 1990 to
FFr948.6m (Dollars 169.3m) in 1991 because of the disruption caused by the
Gulf war in the opening months of the year, writes Alice Rawsthorn in Paris.
Last autumn, Accor fought a fierce battle to take over Wagons-Lits, a
Franco-Belgian concern, in order to expand its presence in the European
hotel market.
Accor had forecast net profits of FFr900m for 1991. Its performance was
slightly better than expected thanks to a good performance in Germany, Italy
and Belgium during the second half.
Group turnover fell modestly from FFr22.8bn in 1990 to FFr22.4bn in 1991.
However, earnings per share declined by 13.3 per cent from FFr50.96 in 1990
to FFr44.15 in 1991 after a reduction in exceptional items from FFr209.9m to
FFr182.8m.

FT  01 APR 92 / UK Company News: The fall into disgrace after a meteoric
rise - The career of the energetic chairman of Control Securities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP RAWSTORNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ARREST of Mr Nazmu Virani casts another shadow over the future of
Control Securities, the property, leisure and pubs group which he built up.
It emerged yesterday that UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, the finance house, had
resigned as adviser to the company. However, City analysts believe that,
unless hitherto unsuspected black holes are uncovered, it should survive.
Although Mr Virani has been the driving force behind the group's rapid
expansion, he has established effective operating managers who are capable
of ensuring that the group's trading performance is maintained, analysts
say.
The City's view of Control Securities has inevitably been coloured by Mr
Virani's high profile leadership. His rise since he arrived in Britain with
one suitcase as a refugee from Idi Amin's Uganda in 1972 has been meteoric.
It aroused suspicions that he was travelling too far, too fast.
He bought a supermarket in Dulwich, south London, and built up a chain of
supermarkets and hotels. In 1976, he bought into a soft drinks manufacturer
and turned it round. He tried to do the same at Belhaven, a Scottish
brewery, becoming chairman in 1984, but he sold it two years later.
In Uganda he had run a property empire - and it was to property he turned
again in 1985 when he bought into Control Securities, then a near bankrupt
Welsh group. He transformed the group, reducing borrowings and acquiring
property in return for paper.
He dealt with some of the biggest operators in the field - John Ritblat,
Tony Clegg, and Gerald Ronson - buying 'good rubbish' from their portfolios.
In 1988, he picked up the Belhaven brewery again and started to build a
large pub estate around it. He bought pubs from Brent Walker and Grand
Metropolitan to create an estate of nearly 800 outlets mainly in Scotland,
the north of England and the Midlands. The brewery makes six brands of its
own beer and undertakes contract brewing for Scottish &amp; Newcastle and Bass.
By 1989, Mr Virani was also developing the hotels side of the business. Bass
sold 27 hotels in Spain to a company in which Control had recently increased
its stake from 50 per cent to about 75 per cent. In the UK, the group owns a
number of hotels including showpiece establishments in London, Folkestone,
and Llandudno.
Mr Virani's evident pride in his progress - capped by the award in 1990 of
Asian Businessman of the Year - did little to allay concern about the speed
of it.
The fund-raising efforts in which he became involved saw him mixing with
royalty, politicians and other leading social lights. The City generally
remained unimpressed; but Heron Corporation had taken a 16 per cent stake in
his company, and GrandMet was happy to accept 9m shares in part payment for
its pubs.
Five years of growth, in which Mr Virani had earned 100th place in the rank
of the UK's richest people, with a family fortune estimated at Pounds 80m,
ended with the collapse of the property market.
The first shock waves of that had scarcely been absorbed before the collapse
of BCCI - one of Control's bankers, a 5.5 per cent shareholder, and the
occupant of two of its buildings. A Pounds 3.8m provision was made against
the exposure.
But neither sentiment nor the share price had recovered before dealings were
suspended last October after detectives from the Serious Fraud Office raided
the company's head office.
Since then, Control has reported pre-tax figures for the six months to last
September of Pounds 4.38m, nearly Pounds 10m down. The empire remains
largely intact - about 100 properties including offices, shops, industrial
and residential premises, 24 hotels, the brewery and 800 pubs. Only one
property, in Kensington, London, appears to have been sold, for Pounds 2.5m.
The group's debt stands at about Pounds 260m but rents and leisure profits
were covered, though only just, at the interim by rents and leisure profits.
Its banks have continued their support.
Though the property market remains difficult, the group's leisure side, with
an improved contribution from its Spanish hotels, lifted interim profits 52
per cent to Pounds 11.5m. Analysts rated that a sound performance, and see
no reason why it should not continue.
Mr Nazmu Virani was remanded in custody for a week after appearing before
City of London magistrates yesterday, charged in connection with the BCCI
investigation.
Mr Virani is charged on one count of conspiring with Mr Mohammed Moizul
Haque and others to present false accounts to the value of Dollars 4m
(Pounds 2.3m) to Price Waterhouse, BCCI's auditors.
It is alleged that the accounts misleadingly showed that BCCI was owed the
money by three companies: Duffleland, Impactlight and Virani Group UK.

Mayflower Corporation, the financial services and automotive products
company, reported pre-tax profits more than doubled at Pounds 1.07m in 1991,
against Pounds 449,000. Gearing was cut from 131 per cent to nil at the year
end.
There was a strong performance from the automotive division, which included
figures from Motor Panels for four months, towards the end of the year. All
companies traded profitably except one of the marketing services offshoots.
However, after an extraordinary charge of Pounds 1.44m (Pounds 1.85m)
relating to business closure costs and the sale of Tri-ang in 1990, the loss
for the year was Pounds 512,000 (Pounds 1.46m).
A dividend is not being recommended but the company said it was proposing a
reduction of the share premium account to eliminate the deficit on
distributable reserves and payments should resume this year.
Group turnover was Pounds 27.4m (Pounds 13.8m). Earnings per share were
1.91p (1.56p).

Bilston &amp; Battersea Enamels recovered from its interim loss to produce a
pre-tax profit of Pounds 120,000 from turnover of Pounds 3.99m for 1991.
In the previous year the profit was Pounds 336,000 from sales of Pounds
4.83m.
Earnings per share dropped to 2p (5.1p). The dividend is omitted (against a
total of 3p) in view of the results and substantial cash outflow at the
beginning of 1992 resulting from the new arrangements with Halcyon Days.
Profit in the second half was Pounds 172,000 (Pounds 114,000) on turnover 9
per cent lower, and was a direct result of further reductions in costs and
staffing and profits from Fine Ceramic Transfers.
Sales for the first quarter of the current year were ahead of 1991, and the
the level of new inquiries had also measurably improved, directors stated.

Lower administration costs and reduced interest charges led to Trafford Park

Full benefit of the savings was partially offset by charging the interest

Turnover fell to Pounds 4.95m (Pounds 6m). Earnings per share were 1.672p

Estates &amp; General, the property group, made a 'creditable' pre-tax profit of
Pounds 2.3m in 1991.
It was struck after provisions of Pounds 900,000 against trading stock and

For the previous year the group made a profit of Pounds 2.77m.
Gross investment rental income rose by 19 per cent to Pounds 8.6m. The level

Rent reviews concluded in the year showed an increase of 84 per cent. The
investment property portfolio had been professionally valued at Pounds
95.7m, a reduction of 9.1 per cent on a year earlier, after sales and
expenditure.
Borrowings had risen to 125 per cent of shareholders' funds and to 53 per

GARTON Engineering lifted pre-tax profits from Pounds 1m to Pounds 1.36m in
1991, helped by exceptional receipts from insurers.
The results were considerably influenced by the continuing effect of the
fire at the end of 1990, Mr Aubrey Garton, chairman, explained. Given the
depressed economic conditions a lower level of profitability would have
occurred.
Turnover fell to Pounds 19.3m (Pounds 22.9m) but the operating surplus moved
up to Pounds 1.59m (Pounds 1.34m). That included Pounds 2.6m net surplus on
replacement of fixed assets and Pounds 1.35m from consequential loss
insurance, and was struck after Pounds 1.3m restructuring and reorganisation
costs.
Earnings per share jumped to 25.84p (17.06p). The dividend is again 7p with
a final of 5.25p.

AVONMORE FOODS, the Irish dairy and food group, yesterday reported a 22 per
cent increase in pre-tax profits to IPounds 16.3m (Pounds 15.2m) for the
year to December 28.
Turnover improved to IPounds 575.2m (IPounds 499.7m). For the first time the
company included a breakdown of divisional performance which showed strong
growth in dairy products with turnover up to IPounds 364.9m (IPounds 308.3m)
and operating profits advancing to IPounds 15.1m (IPounds 9.6m).
The meat and agricultural trading divisions both showed slight declines in
operating profits, falling to IPounds 5.2m (IPounds 5.3m) and IPounds 6.4m
(IPounds 6.6m) respectively, although turnover in meat products grew
strongly to IPounds 109.4m (IPounds 93m).
Mr Pat O'Neil, managing director, said that meat margins 'came under
pressure in 1991 but this follows a very good year in 1990'.
He said that the balance sheet had been greatly strengthened in the past
year. Bank borrowings were down to IPounds 36.7m, representing 23.9 per cent
of capital employed, down from 59.9 per cent in 1990. An open offer last

Earnings per share advanced to 10.83p (9p) and the total dividend is raised

FT  01 APR 92 / UK Company News: Hanson sells Beazer to US offshoot
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HANSON, the Anglo-American conglomerate, last night announced that Beazer,
its wholly-owned subsidiary, has been sold to one of Hanson's US offshoots
as part of the refinancing of Beazer's substantial debt.
Beazer was taken over by Hanson last September, just before it was to float
its UK businesses on the Stock Exchange to enable it to meet obligations to
its banks and make a repayment of Dollars 600m (Pounds 347m) in March 1992.
Beazer's US businesses, which consist of the production of sand, gravel and
aggregates, have now been pledged to Hanson's US banks as security for
Beazer's debt.
In order to do this Beazer has been transferred to the Hanson US subsidiary
for Dollars 91m cash and the assumption of Dollars 100m debt.
Hanson was obliged by the Stock Exchange to announce the move since the
listing of Beazer's 8 per cent convertible unsecured loan stock is to be
maintained.

FT  01 APR 92 / UK Company News: AB Elect loss deepens
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AB ELECTRONIC Products Group, the components manufacturer, reported a
pre-tax loss of Pounds 3.95m for the half year to December 31.
The group warned that it would remain in the red during the second half of
the year.
The outcome, which compared with a loss of Pounds 2.02m, was struck after an
exceptional Pounds 1.05m charge for redundancies and rationalisation.
Sir Peter Phillips, chairman, warned: 'While demand in the electronics
markets served by the group has, in general stabilised, there are no signs
of recovery. The second half made a slow start. The continuing fall in
turnover will prevent the group from returning to profitability in 1991-92.'
Trading profit slumped from Pounds 4.52m to Pounds 2.76m on sales of Pounds
87.6m (Pounds 115.9m). Losses were 13.7p (6.2p) per share.
The components side continued to incur sizeable losses - Pounds 1.46m
compared to Pounds 1.51m.
Profits from the automotive division fell from Pounds 679,000 to Pounds
202,000 reflecting falling orders from the UK luxury car market.
The group blamed competitive conditions in the computer market for the fall
from Pounds 1.45m to Pounds 686,000 in profits from the assemblies division.

FT  01 APR 92 / UK Company News: Too deep a hole to dig itself out of easily
 -How Speyhawk has fallen prey to the property market collapse
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SPEYHAWK's huge losses are further confirmation of the forces that have
pushed the UK commercial property industry into the worst decline since the
1930s.
Its pre-tax loss of Pounds 217m for the year to September 30 may not be a
record for stricken UK developers - Rosehaugh produced a pre-tax loss of
Pounds 227m for the year to end-June. It is however a remarkably steep
decline. A year ago, it announced a pre-tax loss of just Pounds 2.86m and
net assets of Pounds 140.5m.
Nonetheless, many City commentators saw Speyhawk's fall as merely a matter
of time. As a developer with a large number of unlet buildings under
construction, it was badly exposed to the property slump. Its only hope of
avoiding the consequences was in attracting a partner with deeper pockets.
This prospect crumbled in August 1990 when Nordstjernan, a Swedish property
company, pulled out of of deal to buy Speyhawk after the invasion of Kuwait.
Speyhawk encapsulates two of the worst problems in the UK property market,
the parlous state of the City office market and the plummeting values of
development sites. Over half of its Pounds 205m provisions are due to two
City buildings, which are worth around half their construction costs. One,
at St Mary Axe, is 155,000 sq ft; the other, built over Cannon Bridge is
195,000 sq ft, of which 100,000 sq ft is let to Liffe, the financial market.
In a City market, where nearly one in five office buildings are empty, it
could take years for Speyhawk to fill its buildings. Even if Speyhawk
succeeds in securing a tenant, it is likely to be for significantly less
than the asking rent of Pounds 45 per sq ft. Worse still, tenants are
insisting on rent-free periods of at least two years, leaving a large hole
in Speyhawk's cash flow.
The next largest contributor to Speyhawk's huge losses are its development
sites such as Weymouth town centre and the old ITN building have been
slashed to a quarter of their former value. Development site values are
particularly sensitive to market conditions as their worth lies in the
difference between the buildings' potential value and their potential cost.
Speyhawk's task in digging itself out of this hole is a large one. Its 30
properties are half empty on average. Unless it can let the buildings, it
cannot hope to sell them. Last year it made just Pounds 75m of sales,
compared with Pounds 200m.
Mr Osborne is upbeat about the prospects of an increase in values. 'We have
agreed a four-year period with the banks so that we don't need to sell at
these levels.' He reports a 'healthy level' of enquiries at Thames Business
Park and reckons that in two years time, the City rental market will have
improved.
The idea that they would be selling at the bottom of the market is the main
reason for the banks' decision to support Speyhawk. A forced sale would send
prices down into another downward spiral. In any case, there is no obvious
market for unlet buildings.
That said, it is still no mean achievement to get agreement between so many
banks. The final agreement, which has taken since last August, has yet to be
signed. Speyhawk has 46 banks worldwide, led by Barclays and Citibank, and
debts of Pounds 303m.
This total includes Speyhawk's off balance sheet loans, as their covenants
were broken and they had to be considered with the rest of the debt. 'I have
come to the conclusion that non-recourse debt is a concept rather than
reality,' says Mr Osborne.
After a standstill on debt repayments since last August, Speyhawk has agreed
with its banks to reduce its debts over a four-year period. The banks will
not need to put new money into the company.
Shareholders will receive information on the restructuring, which will
include a reorganisation of share capital, when a final agreement is reached
with the banks. Liabilities exceed assets by Pounds 70m but the banks have
agreed to subordinate part of their debt to keep the company solvent.
The pre-tax losses of Pounds 217m were struck after provisions of Pounds
205m. Turnover decreased by 71 per cent to Pounds 76.4m. The loss per share
was 829.7p (27.8p).
In some ways, Speyhawk's decline marks full circle for the 1980s development
boom. Speyhawk was first of a wave of property developers to join the stock
market during the 1980s. Now, nearly all of them have either been taken
over, or have run into severe difficulties.
A remarkable aspect of the end of this era is how few have been put in
receivership. For all the severity of the decline, the boom is ending not
with a bang but a whimper.

FT  01 APR 92 / SAS increasesits British Midland stake
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS, Aerospace Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SCANDINAVIAN Airlines System (SAS) is strengthening its ties with British
Midland by increasing its stake in the UK carrier's parent company, Airlines
of Britain Holding, from 24.9 per cent to 40 per cent for Pounds 25m.
The deal follows recent approaches by other airlines interested in acquiring
a stake in the UK carrier because of its strong position at London's
Heathrow airport.
Sir Michael Bishop, chairman of the UK group which owns Manx Airlines and
Loganair as well as British Midland, said yesterday he had been approached
by several airlines since the UK government abolished the Heathrow traffic
distribution rules last year and opened up the airport to new entrants.
British Midland controls about 15 per cent of the take-off and landing
times, or 'slots', at Heathrow, the world's biggest international passenger
airport but also one of the most congested. International airlines, which
had been barred from using Heathrow under the old traffic rules, have been
anxious to expand their operations at the airport by securing slots.
But Sir Michael said his company was keen to strengthen its links with SAS
because of successful co-operation between the two airlines during the last
three years.
'We reported to SAS the interest other companies were expressing but we also
made it clear we wanted to maintain a long-term relationship with SAS,' he
said.
British Midland has recently negotiated ticketing and co-operation
agreements with other carriers including United Airlines, South African
Airways, Qantas and Air Canada. The Scandinavian airline acquired its
initial 24.9 per cent stake in the UK group for Pounds 25m in 1988.
The Civil Aviation Authority is not expected to object to the increased SAS
shareholding because control of British Midland remains with UK nationals.
Mr Jan Carlzon, chief executive of SAS, said the latest Pounds 25m
investment strengthened his airline's strategic position in the UK, the most
important market outside Scandinavia for SAS.
Sir Michael said British Midland, which started a Heathrow to Brussels
service this week, would continue to expand its European network. European
services were expected to account for more than 50 per cent of revenues next
year rising to around 80 per cent in five years.
After losing Pounds 11.9m in 1990, British Midland made a pre-tax profit of
Pounds 2.56m last year, he said.

FT  01 APR 92 / Tyne Tees makes Pounds 213,000 pre-tax
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE STRESS in the UK's commercial television system showed again yesterday
as Tyne Tees Television returned a pre-tax profit of Pounds 213,000 on
turnover of Pounds 58m. This compares with a pre-tax profit of Pounds 5.77m
on a turnover of Pounds 54.4m in 1990.
The modest profit at the largest of the small ITV companies represented a
considerable turnround compared with a first-half loss of nearly Pounds 3m.
On Friday HTV, the ITV company for Wales and the west, declared pre-tax
profits of Pounds 441,000 on a turnover of Pounds 171m.
From January when the new 10-year licences begin, Tyne Tees must start
paying Pounds 15.06m a year plus 2 per cent of its net advertising revenue.
The ITV company believes that in spite of the deep advertising recession
there were signs of real revenue growth in the last quarter of 1991 and the
trend had continued this year.
'We have good reason to believe that even modest revenue growth, together
with our continuing tight control of costs and the reduction in levy will
lead to a satisfactory result for 1992,' Sir Ralph Carr-Ellison, Tyne Tees
chairman said yesterday.
The company is sticking to forecasts that a pre-tax profit of more than
Pounds 2m is possible for 1993 in spite of the relatively large size of the
franchise bid.
Mr Ian Richie, Tyne Tees managing director, believes that the regulatory
changes - everything from no longer having to fund Channel 4 to a smaller
levy and national network contributions based on ability to pay - will be
worth around Pounds 10m a year to the company.
Staff numbers have also been reduced from 553 in 1990 to 308.
Mr Richie also hopes that Tynes Tees will be able to increase its share of
advertising revenue from its present 3.2 per cent to something more
accurately reflecting the north-east region's 4.3 per cent of consumer
expenditure and 5 per cent of UK households.
The extent to which Tyne Tees succeeds this year will give a significant
indication of how the smaller ITV companies are coping with the consequences
of competitive tenders for new franchises.
Tyne Tees is recommending a final dividend of 9.5p making a total for the
year of 14.5p compared with 19p in 1990. Earnings per share dropped from
36.19p to 1.65p.

FT  01 APR 92 / Lonrho shares at lowest since 1984
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD and ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LONRHO'S share price yesterday fell 13 1/2 p to close at 65 1/2 p, its
lowest since January 1984, as Phillips &amp; Drew Securities confirmed it was
resigning as Lonrho's joint stockbroker in protest at the international
trading conglomerate's lack of consultation over its big deals.
Phillips &amp; Drew, the main marketmaker in Lonrho shares, was particularly
irritated by the group's failure to tell it of its decision to sell a third
of its holding in Metropole Hotels to the Libyans for Pounds 177m.
The move came as the United Nations Security Council last night ordered
sanctions against Libya over its refusal to surrender two men accused of
masterminding the bombing of Pan Am flight 103 over Lockerbie in 1988.
Meanwhile, banks with big loans to Lonrho, led by Barclays, Standard
Chartered and Lloyds, have become anxious that banks with smaller Lonrho
loans might attempt to reduce their exposure.
The big banks are not keen to increase their loans to Lonrho to replace any
bank facilities that could be withdrawn. 'If a number of peripheral lenders
cut their lines, that would cause us a problem,' said one banker. He added
that the main lenders had been discussing how to maintain bankers'
confidence in Lonrho.
It also emerged yesterday that Barclays has the biggest lending exposure to
Lonrho, thought to be around Pounds 150m, compared with Pounds 100m for
Standard Chartered and Pounds 70m for Lloyds.
Lonrho's proposed deal with the Libyans caused its second biggest
shareholder, US-based Fidelity Research and Management, to voice concern
that it might have to sell its 9.8 per cent stake.
Fidelity is concerned about what action may be taken by the US Treasury's
Office of Foreign Assets Control, which enforces a ban against US companies
dealing with Libyan-owned or controlled institutions.
The UK Department of Trade and Industry has said the UN sanctions would not
affect businesses with Libyan investments.
Many Lonrho institutional shareholders, which criticised the Libyan deal,
said they regretted the resignation of Phillips &amp; Drew.
Societe Generale Strauss Turnball, Lonrho's other joint broker, is to
continue to act for the company as sole broker.

FT  01 APR 92 / Fondiaria reinforces AMB link
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FONDIARIA, the leading Italian insurance group, is spending DM562m (Pounds
196m) to buy a 14.2 per cent stake in Aachener und Munchener Beteiligungs
(AMB), Germany's second largest insurer, in a move further cementing links
between the two.
The deal, which raises Fondiaria's share in AMB to 20 per cent, will
reinforce the Italian group's growing foreign activities and may help AMB to
resist the unwanted advances of Assurances Generales de France (AGF), the
French state-owned insurer, which owns 25 per cent of AMB. AMB and AGF have
been locked in a battle of wits over the French group's desire to gain a
significant minority stake. AMB has so far registered voting rights for only
9 per cent of AGF's holding and made clear it regarded AGF's share purchases
as unfriendly.
Fondiaria is already associated with AMB and Royal Insurance of the UK in a
recently-established tripartite alliance, European Partners for Insurance
Co-operation (EPIC), designed to develop joint European insurance ventures.
The Italian group had an option on an 18.8 per cent stake in AMB formerly
held by Royal, which was sold to Credit Suisse last year. That option
expired yesterday, explaining the timing of the announcement.
Last January, Fondiaria sold to AMB, for DM600m, its 25 per cent stake in
Volksfursorge, the former German trade union-owned life insurer, in which it
had invested jointly with AMB. The move provoked speculation that Fondiaria
could use the proceeds to exercise the option to buy into AMB - as has now
happened.

FT  01 APR 92 / Japan cuts discount rate by 0.75 points to 3.75%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVEN BUTLER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE BANK of Japan, the country's central bank, early today cut the official
discount rate by 0.75 points to 3.75 per cent in response to the rapid
weakening of the Japanese economy.
The cut came a day after the Tokyo stock market plunged to its lowest level
in five years as investors showed disappointment with a government economic
package aimed at stimulating the economy.
Share prices fell further in initial trading this morning, with the Nikkei
average down nearly 300 points shortly after opening.
The rate cut is the biggest since the central bank began to ease monetary
policy last summer, when the ODR stood at 6 per cent. It indicates growing
concern in the bank over the rapid decline in economic indicators over the
past two months.
The bank last cut the interest rate in late December, but the reduction has
had no appreciable impact on the economy, with industrial output declining
and monetary growth at an historic low.
News that the cut was coming was leaked to the Japanese press yesterday but
stock market investors failed to respond positively. After a slight rise
initially, the Nikkei average on the Tokyo Stock Exchange dropped yesterday
by 323.36 on the day to close at 19,345.95
'Sentiment is so poor that I don't think the market would be happy with
anything now,' said Mr Craig Chudler, strategist at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew.
The market is standing more than 50 per cent below the highs reached more
than two years ago.
The 0.75 point rate cut, compared with earlier cuts of half a point, is
likely to be the last reduction for some time. Economists have argued that
potential borrowers needed to believe that rates have hit bottom before they
will take on fresh debt and increase spending. A cut of this size signals
that the Bank of Japan's overriding concern of recent years to control
inflation has been replaced by worries about the health of the economy.
The government yesterday said its emergency economic measures would boost
demand by at least Y4,000bn (Pounds 17bn) in the first half of the fiscal
year (which begins today) compared with the same period a year ago.
But private economists said increased spending over current budgets in the
first half of the year would be much smaller and the actual impact of the
package difficult to detect.

FT  01 APR 92 / Commercial users seen to gain from road pricing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN, Public Policy Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COMMERCIAL transport operators stand to gain most from the introduction of
road pricing in the UK's towns and cities, according to a study published
yesterday by the Chartered Institute of Transport.
Car users at the upper and lower ends of the income ranges were more likely
to benefit from road pricing - charging motorists electronically for the
road space they use - than those in the middle income range.
The report is published as a three-year programme of research commissioned
by the government gets under way to see whether a road pricing scheme could
help in reducing urban congestion.
Although all vehicles would have to pay on urban roads, the cost for
lorries, vans and taxis would be balanced by savings from shorter journey
times, more predictable traffic conditions and easier kerbside loading and
unloading, the report says.
Institute figures suggest that half the benefits of road pricing in London
would accrue to commercial traffic, which would pay less than a third of the
charges.
For bus operators, the charges would be substantially less than the savings
from shorter running times, smaller fleets, greater reliability and
additional revenue from passengers who would leave their cars at home.
Wealthier individuals would be more willing to pay charges to benefit from
reduced congestion, it says. Low income families unable to afford cars could
benefit from improved public transport. The greatest inconvenience would be
to car owners unable to afford the road charges and who would have to change
their travel arrangements.
Paying for progress - supplementary report. Chartered Institute of
Transport, 80 Portland Place, London W1N 4DP. Pounds 12.50.

FT  01 APR 92 / The Lex Column: Lonrho
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Lonrho's last day as a constituent of the FT-SE index was not one it will
care to remember. The company was abandoned by its joint lead broker,
Phillips &amp; Drew, which then aggressively marked down the shares. But perhaps
more humiliatingly, its market capitalisation fell to a mere Pounds 430m, or
Pounds 100m less than the value put by Libya on Lonrho's Metropole Hotels
group when it bought a one-third stake last week.
The share price fall aside, Lonrho's banks must be thoroughly unnerved at
the speed with which its finances appear to have gone awry. They have
advanced it more than Pounds 800m of unsecured loans, of which Pounds 250m
is repayable this year or next, and a further Pounds 430m within five years.
Granted, Lonrho has favourable covenants which deprive the banks of an
excuse for withdrawing existing facilities in the short term. But the group
is already seen as a forced seller of assets, which will scarcely help
efforts to reduce or roll over its debts. Shareholders are doubtless asking
themselves how much their shares would be worth in the event that such
efforts prove unsuccessful.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The French stock market has never liked Mrs Edith Cresson, so it is not
surprising that equity prices have tended to rise as rumours of her
resignation gathered pace this week. There is no change in the economic
fundamentals, however, which are not encouraging. The National Accounts
Committee trimmed its 1992 economic growth forecast to 2 per cent yesterday
from 2.2 per cent, and even the new figure looks optimistic. Slower growth
is pushing up the budget deficit, though it is still well within the
Maastricht limits.
The market expectation is that Mr Pierre Beregovoy will take over from Mrs
Cresson if and when she goes. He is trusted with the defence of the franc,
and there would be less risk of exchange market nervousness forcing an
increase in short-term interest rates. But the problem for France, as for
other ERM members, is that it now looks likely that German rates will stay
high for the rest of the year. Even though French inflation is now nearly
two percentage points lower than that of Germany, there is little scope for
undercutting German interest rates, as last year's painful experiment
showed. Nor is realignment the answer, if Mr Beregovoy would ever permit it.
The experience of 1987 showed it actually led to higher interest rates.
Recovery, as elsewhere in Europe, thus looks as though it will be deferred.
Set in that context, any post-Cresson rally on the bourse could be short
lived. The CAC index has already outperformed the Dow by nearly 8 per cent
this year. There is no reason for any further outperformance.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Judging by the failure of Monday's package of measures to reassure the
equity market, Japan's politicians and central bankers are singularly
unruffled by the domestic economy. They will have only themselves to blame
if the measures fail to avert a financial crisis. The  3/4 point cut in the
official discount rate, which came as expected last night, might yet provide
small reassurance for equities, particularly if the new financial year gets
off to a positive start today. But sentiment suggests investors are unlikely
to rush in while the outlook for the economy is so uncertain.
By delaying the rate cut for so long, the authorities left themselves in an
uncomfortable position. If companies do not resume borrowing and spending
soon, the economy will grow only slightly this year and could conceivably
slip into recession.
With Dollars 114bn of corporate equity-linked debt due for repayment or
refinancing by the end of next year, it is tantalisingly unclear whether
lower rates and talk of easier regulations in the corporate bond market will
have the desired effect on companies' confidence. The interest burden of new
debt issuance would scarcely help earnings to recover, while higher yields
on corporate bonds might attract money away from equities. There is little
scope for further rate cuts. That leaves the option of a second attempt at a
fiscal stimulus, but that is an unreliable tool as yesterday's market
response appeared to indicate.

FT  01 APR 92 / The Lex Column: Speyhawk falls to earth
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Speyhawk's warning that shareholders should not expect a dividend 'for some
time' looks like the understatement of the year. No doubt unintentionally,
it brings to mind the final words of Captain Oates as he headed off into a
snowstorm in the Antarctic - and remember what happened to him. Admittedly,
if all goes according to plan, the bank restructuring transforms Pounds 70m
of negative net worth into a modest net asset position - so the company is
not technically bust. But with a market capitalisation shrunk to only Pounds
500,000, the shares are for long-term contrarians only.
Investors will be more interested in the knock-on effects on a sector whose
frailty is reflected by the fact that 20 per cent of property companies
listed in the back of this newspaper are now penny stocks. A few, like
Sheraton, have disappeared, but yesterday's events confirm the impression
already gained through Rosehaugh, London and Metropolitan, Heron and Olympia
&amp; York of bankers deeply reluctant to pull the plug. The market is already
aware of the scale of unwanted office accommodation in the City, but another
company with banks in the driving seat can only further dent confidence and
delay a recovery.
Speyhawk's write-down vividly demonstrates the particular vulnerability of

between the potential cost of their sites and the potential value of selling

especially devastating valuations in current conditions. Even so,
shareholders are entitled to ask what assumptions were made when the balance
sheet was drawn up a year ago.
Notwithstanding the efforts by the chairman, Mr Trevor Osborne, and
colleagues to cut overheads, and the lack of alternative options for the
lenders, they are also entitled to ponder the justice of management keeping
their jobs.

If the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi's Natural Law Party fails to win a seat in
Britain's general election, his transcendental meditating supporters can at
least look forward to a break in their very own theme park, soon to be built
 -barring acts of God, presumably  - on the banks of Niagara Falls.
Well-founded reports suggest that the Yogi is teaming up with a Canadian
magician, Doug Henning, to construct a 1,400 acre theme park, costing
CDollars 690m and ready to open in three years' time.
The main promise of the park is to provide 'enlightenment, knowledge and

fee of some Dollars 20, more mercenary motives might be suspected. Today the

Still on the subject of where are they now. I see that Peter Lucas has
finally abandoned the board of Bond Corporation, Alan Bond's old flagship.
Lucas, a lawyer, first joined Bond Corporation in 1971. Although he had a
long spell off the board between 1976 and 1985, he was one of the loyal
lieutenants who followed the great deal-maker around the world picking up
the pieces. However, he shot to prominence when he took over as chairman
following Bond's resignation in September 1990. His job was to calm the
company's creditors, and the anxious Australian regulators, while a
debt-for-equity swap was arranged with bondholders owed more than ADollars
1bn. It was his emollient approach, more than Bond's posturing, which kept
the group afloat long enough for the scheme to be put in place.
His departure removes the last link with Bond Corp's happier days. Bond
himself faces both criminal charges and bankruptcy proceedings, and Peter
Beckwith, his former right-hand man, died two years ago. Lucas's office says
there was 'nothing sinister or sensational' about his departure. He probably
has nothing left to do.

Guess what? Guinness Peat Aviation, the world's largest aircraft leasing

content with signing up such heavyweight names as Nigel Lawson, Garret
Fitzgerald, and Peter Sutherland, GPA founder Tony Ryan has just hired
Charlie Haughey's old pr man - PJ Mara  - as his new media relations
adviser.
As Haughey's press secretary for the past five years, Mara played a key role
in Haughey's surprisingly long existence as Ireland's prime minister.
However, even his legendary skills were not enough to prevent Haughey being
forced out of office following a mounting series of financial and political
scandals.
PJ, as he likes to be known, is the consummate spin-doctor. He managed to
keep his boss one step ahead of the baying hounds of the press corps,
putting them off the scent with humorous, in-depth, off-the-record
briefings, and even in Haughey's darkest hours managed to maintain a sense
of bonhomie between his government and the fourth estate. He proudly recaps
by saying: 'I never told a lie'.
Nevertheless, it's a strange appointment. A bit like putting Sir Bernard
Ingham, Mrs Thatcher's old mouthpiece, in charge of British Airways' public
relations.

Volker Ruhe's elevation to German defence minister may have come a little
late for his good friend Chris Patten. For Ruhe, a former English teacher

Nearer to home, the secretary-general of Helmut Kohl's Christian Democrats,
who has garnered a reputation for ruthless political in-fighting, may be
making foreign minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher turn sour for quite a

Ruhe has made little secret of the fact that he is after the job Genscher
has had since 1974; he loses few opportunities to snipe at his rival.
Making do with second-best for now by taking the poisoned chalice of defence
 -five previous incumbents, including Gerhard Stoltenberg, have had to
resign prematurely - there is no doubt he will use the post in his campaign
to clip Genscher's wings.
Ironically, it was probably Free Democrat party leader Genscher who whipped
up the issue of German arms supplies to Turkey which has now toppled
Stoltenberg. His reward is having to contend with Ruhe across the cabinet
table - in place of his affable but ineffectual predecessor.

FT  01 APR 92 / A package that fails to please: Steven Butler asks whether
Japan's spending proposals can boost the economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVEN BUTLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The verdict on the Japanese government's package of emergency economic
measures announced early yesterday could hardly have been more swift or more
clear. As investors gradually absorbed the details of the package, the stock
market fell 323.36 points to finish the fiscal year at a new five-year low
of 19,345.95 on the Nikkei index.
The market was also unimpressed by reports that Japan's official discount
rate would be cut by 0.75 percentage points to 3.75 per cent, a move which
was indeed announced early this morning.
With manufacturing inventories bulging and capital spending being reduced,
many economists believe that even a steep cut in rates would not encourage
fresh corporate borrowing.
The government's package, aimed at stimulating the economy, did not dispel
the deep sense of pessimism which has tightened its grip on Japanese
financial markets; it merely reinforced fears that no one was riding to the
rescue.
In spite of cries of anguish from the financial industry, burdened by
trillions of yen of bad debt; in spite of plunging property prices,
collapsing profits of manufacturing companies, steep cuts in manufacturing
investment, falling industrial output, and weakening consumer spending; in
spite of all this, the Japanese government does not believe the economy is
suffering from much more than a lack of confidence.
The government is accelerating public infrastructure investment by spending
75 per cent of the annual budget in the first half of the year. Yet the
programme includes not a single yen of previously unbudgeted money.
Economists could find only a maximum of two trillion yen (about Pounds 9bn)
of spending - amounting to less than half a per cent of gross national
product - moved from the second half of the year to the first. There is no
commitment as yet to fill in the spending gap in the second half of the
year.
In announcing the package, the Economic Planning Agency, which co-ordinates
government economic policy, argued that employment, consumer spending and
even corporate profits remained strong. The agency said it was merely trying
to prevent a psychology of pessimism from spreading throughout the economy.
But is the government right? Is Japan's underlying economy strong in spite
of the deep depression among financial and manufacturing industries? The
fall in capital spending, industrial output and the cooling of consumer
spending, it maintains, are a necessary and even healthy response to the
rampant asset inflation of the 1980s 'bubble economy'.
Or has Mr Yasushi Mieno, the central bank governor, squeezed too hard and
too long in efforts to damp inflation by means of high interest rates -
until this morning at 4.5 per cent  - and thereby caused an unnecessary
slowdown in the economy?
A great deal is at stake. Japan's trading partners are increasingly annoyed
at Japan's huge trade surpluses. As the US and European economies try to
climb out of recession, they will not want to see depressed import demand
from Japanese consumers, the main cause of the rise in the trade surplus
over the past year.
The strongly negative reaction of the US government to the stagnation of US
semiconductor sales in Japan, announced on Monday, could be a taste of much
nastier things to come, particularly in industries such as cars or
electronics. It is, therefore, important not only to Japanese companies and
shareholders but also to the world trading system that the government comes
close to its growth target of 3.5 per cent this year by reviving domestic
demand. This, however, is looking less and less realistic.
The roots of the current slowdown lie in the enormous expansion of the
Japanese economy in the late 1980s. The fall in the official discount rate,
the rate at which the central bank lends to commercial banks, to a low of
2.5 per cent during 1987 and 1988, together with a rising stock market,
meant that corporations were able to raise funding at almost no cost,
contributing to an asset price boom.
Mr Mieno began to raise interest rates in 1989 to pierce the bubble. The
stock market first buckled in early 1990 and land prices have fallen steeply
since then, leaving banks and companies with poorly secured loans and
accumulating bad debts.
It seemed that he had successfully steered a delicate course - puncturing
the asset price boom and bringing down consumer price inflation, yet having
little impact on economic activity. The current slowdown, however, suggests
that such a positive diagnosis may have been premature.
As a series of unexpectedly weak statistics over the past month has shown,
the economy is now in pain:
Industrial output. Industrial production declined in February for the fifth
month running on a year-on-year basis. Factory output was 4.2 per cent lower
in February than a year ago and 0.6 per cent less than in January.
Production is being pushed down because manufacturers have accumulated
inventories of unsold goods. The adjustment process of bringing down those
inventories has begun. Inventories fell by 1.4 per cent from January after
months of build-up, but they remained 10 per cent higher than a year ago in
February.
Money supply. Japan's money supply growth has fallen to historic lows for
three months running, with broad money (M2 plus certificates of deposits)
expanding by just 1.6 per cent in February. The growth rate has been
distorted by a flight of money into postal savings, which are excluded from
the definition of broad money. Nonetheless, even on its widest definition,
credit growth has fallen well below the central bank's projections. A
collapse of demand for funds from the corporate sector is what lies behind
the exceptionally weak numbers.
Consumer spending. Consumers have money in their pockets, but they are not
spending it as actively as they were up until last autumn. Store sales have
generally been flat to slightly negative year-on-year.
Bank assets. Banks may be shouldering up to Y20,000bn (Pounds 87bn) in bad
and doubtful debts, much of which is secured by property that has plunged in
value. The true size of the problem is impossible to gauge because banks are
not required to report the figure or cover it with provisions.
With the commercial banks' reserve capital eroded by the stock market
plunge, banks could struggle to meet the 8 per cent capital-to-asset ratios
specified by the Bank for International Settlements, which take effect next
year. The need to meet this ratio is creating difficulties for the banking
system and many weaker banks may face a crisis. Most banks are being forced
to reduce their asset base, and to be exceptionally cautious about extending
new credit.
One obstacle to an autumn recovery is that banks will encounter problems
providing the necessary finance for expansion. Even sound but not cash-rich
companies may then find it hard to borrow.
All this evidence would appear to point to an economy with serious
difficulties in many sectors. Compared with the scale of the problems, the
government's package of fiscal measures intended to stimulate the economy
looks inadequate, unless it is followed by a supplementary budget to boost
domestic growth. Economists yesterday were talking of the need for a
stimulus of Y5,000bn-worth of public spending.
The government may, however, be proved right in its belief that the economy
is not as deeply troubled as it might appear. 'Recession' in Japan certainly
looks nothing like its counterpart in the UK or the US where the cost in
unemployment, house repossessions and failing businesses is high. As the
Japanese economy steadily weakened over the past year, 1.4m jobs have been
created. Unemployment in February declined by a 0.1 percentage point to 2
per cent. Nationwide there are still about 1.25 jobs for every applicant.
However, this ratio has dropped over the past year, and many companies have
cut overtime.
Economic hopes are pinned on a recovery of consumer and business confidence
and spending. Consumers are not burdened by heavy debts as are their
counterparts in the US and Europe. Corporate liquidity, profits and capital
investment plans are low only by the inflated standards of recent years.
The Long Term Credit Bank of Japan this week projected an 8.2 per cent
decline in manufacturing investment in the fiscal year starting today.
Nonetheless, in the larger service sector, investment is set to rise by 4.5
per cent.
On balance, this is not the picture of an economy on the verge of collapse.
Economists at Salomon Brothers, the securities house, are more pessimistic
than most observers; but even they project growth of 1.3 per cent in the
coming fiscal year with no further fiscal stimulus. Should the government
adopt a Y5,000bn supplementary budget in the autumn, which it could afford,
annual GNP growth would rise considerably faster than that.
Whether growth stays above 2 per cent depends to a large extent on what the
Japanese government and the central bank wish to achieve. Mr Mieno, with
good reason, has chosen so far to stamp on inflation while risking slower
economic growth. But the longer monetary policy remains tight, the greater
the risk that he will push deflation too far. Mr Mieno and his colleagues in
the government are likely to find that the dangers of a sharply slower
economy are now far greater than any possible resurgence of inflation.
Mr Mieno's decision to cut interest rates makes the probability of a sharp
contraction in the economy less likely. But a further easing of monetary and
fiscal policy may well be needed before he, and his political masters, can
be sure that the threat has disappeared.

FT  01 APR 92 / Leading Article: New challenges for Mr Mieno
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BANK of Japan has overplayed its waiting game; monetary policy has
remained too tight for too long. The desire of its governor, Mr Yasushi
Mieno, to appear independent of political influence has prevented the
interest rate cuts needed to boost confidence and revive Japan's ailing
economy. Yesterday's modest fiscal package will do little to improve growth
prospects; fiscal policy is a notoriously ineffective tool for stabilising
economies. And the risks facing Japan's economy justify a more aggressive
easing of monetary policy than today's Official Discount Rate cut.
It is slow growth, not a revival of inflation, that now threatens Japan's
economic stability. Mr Mieno was right to keep monetary policy tight
throughout 1989 and 1990 to deflate Japan's asset price bubble; it appeared
he would succeed without causing a recession. But last year's hero risks
turning into today's villain. The governor may well have gone too far
already in a deflationary direction.
The Bank of Japan remains obsessed with the need to prevent a resurgence of
land and retail price inflation, even though the stock market is at a
five-year low; residential land prices fell last year for the first time in
17 years; broad money growth has reached a record low; and wholesale prices
fell in February. Meanwhile, the impending signs of recession are
accumulating: gross domestic product fell in the last quarter of 1991;
industrial output fell in February compared with the year before; and
business and consumer confidence are depressed.
Failing the test
The latest cut has brought interest rates down by just 2 1/4 percentage
points from their 1991 peak. An effective central banker must be willing
both to raise interest rates at the first sign of inflationary pressure and
then cut them aggressively when falling inflation risks turning into output
deflation. Mr Mieno has yet to pass the latter test.
Japan may still escape the full-scale debt deflation that the US and UK are
currently enduring. The Japanese financial sector has been hit by the
combination of high real interest rates, the fall in stock market wealth and
accumulating bad debts. But, so far, companies and consumers have escaped
relatively unscathed.
Japan's consumers are not being hit by the paralysing combination of heavy
debts and rising unemployment that has stalled recoveries in the US and
Europe. Householders were largely unable to borrow against residential
property values during the boom, and unemployment remains low. The corporate
sector is more exposed to high interest rates and falling stock prices. Even
so, corporate liquidity remains above its levels of the early 1980s.
International side-effects
Slow rather than no growth remains the more probable outcome for Japan this
year. But the international side-effects of this domestic slowdown are
great. Domestically, the credit squeeze may be confined to the financial
sector. But the unwillingness of Japanese banks to lend, and their need to
contract assets to meet international capital standards, is starving world
financial markets of new capital. Nor can export-oriented Japan ignore the
effects of its domestic policies on its main trading partners. Its trade
surplus has doubled over the past year, owing largely to falling imports.
Yesterday's fiscal package will have done little to raise import demand. But
if easing trade tension was the aim, the action was a modest step in the
right direction. It offered no new spending on top of the small increase
already agreed; its effect on growth this year will be modest. But by
bringing 75 per cent of this spending forward to the first half of the
fiscal year, it suggested there may be more money to come. A shift towards
more public spending, and less public saving, is the best way to reduce the
trade surplus.
Robust domestic demand growth is also a prerequisite for smooth US-Japanese
relations. The best way to spark recovery is to push interest rates down.
The  3/4 percentage point cut will not suffice, and Mr Mieno must be willing
to cut rates again if business and consumer spending fails to respond. An
independent central banker is better than a politically compliant one, but
there is no merit in being independently wrong.

FT  01 APR 92 / Personal View: One, two pull together
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIR PETER PARKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As election day approaches, the polls continue to suggest that a hung
parliament in which all parties become minorities will be the most likely
outcome. This would mean that the result which may be most favoured by
Financial Times readers, that of an overall Conservative majority, will not
be on offer - and a Conservative government is the one with which the
markets have traditionally felt most at home.
I do not favour a hung parliament, and I know that I am not alone in the
ranks of industry and commerce in taking this view.
However, in a situation where the electorate decides to deny any party
overall power, it is incumbent on those of us engaged in wealth creation to
think hard what would then be best for us. The preferred solution for short-
and long-term benefits would be a stable coalition.
Consider the alternative. A hung parliament could result in chronic
instability: a minority government trying to go it alone for a few months in
a desperate bid to conjure legitimacy out of office rather than from the
voters; a second election within months and continuing crippling uncertainty
for markets, investment and consumer spending.
John Major has already noted that vital economic decisions, by companies and
shoppers, are being postponed until after the election. That paralysis would
become much worse with a second election continually just around the corner,
and no assurance that even then the voters might not decide on a replay. The
end of the recession would be further delayed with damaging consequences for
those companies hanging on by their fingernails.
The temptations to play for time for a short period until the Queen can
decently be asked for a second election are considerable in a system of
government which Lord Hailsham described as an 'elective dictatorship'.
I believe the markets fear this scenario most of all. Were the fear to
spread, sterling could be put under great pressure. This, taken together
with events in Germany and the uncovenanted rise in the UK public sector
borrowing requirement, could force an interest rate increase. A minority
government might find that such an increase becomes an indispensable hostage
to be given to uncertainty.
But a hung parliament does not have to result in such a vicious circle of
instability and uncertainty. Political leaders could behave with decent
humility in the face of the fact that the electors have decided not to trust
them with unfettered power. They could act responsibly as their counterparts
do throughout continental Europe and resolve to create stability by sharing
power. This may be difficult in an adversarial political culture after a
bitter election, but it is not impossible.
A stable partnership government or coalition, working to an agreed programme
over a period of, say, four years could offer an attractive climate for
business and personal investment. The more excessive policies of the senior
partner, for instance Labour's high marginal tax rates and its minimum wage,
or the Conservative refusal to invest adequately in education and training,
could be reversed. There would be less legislation, and what there was would
be of higher quality.
Nothing can remove the difficulties of governing in a complex modern society
but at least such a partnership government would have the authority of most
of the electorate behind it; and could avoid follies such as the poll tax
which resulted from an exercise of power without formal limits.
The natural junior partners in such an election are the Liberal Democrats,
who seem likely to emerge from the election with Paddy Ashdown's authority
enhanced, more than one fifth of the vote and more than 20 seats.
Proportional representation - the Lib Dems condition for participation in a
partnership government - would have a special advantage. It would open the
door to a modernisation of our democracy, making Westminster and Whitehall
more like our best companies: open, communicative and capable of getting the
best out of people rather than being closed, secretive and ultimately
incompetent. Many business leaders have supported the introduction of PR,
including the Confederation of British Industry Conference just before the
government came to office. What they seek is the stability which comes from
governments' being forced to listen and to adopt evolutionary rather than
revolutionary change.
So when we ponder our response to a hung parliament let us remember that
what happens afterwards depends on the politicians, and on the pressure the
public puts on them. They could choose confusion and instability, and we
would all pay the price; or they could settle down to make parliament viable
and stable good government possible. I have no doubt which would be best for
business, and ultimately for all of us.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW CLEMENTS and MAX LOPPERT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ranki's appearance at St John's on Monday was a real lunchtime treat. London
seems to have been starved of fine piano recitals lately - too many
cancellations, too many second-rate pianists propelled to top billing - and
by any measure Ranki, an infrequent visitor here, belongs in the top flight.
His programme of Haydn, Kurtag and Beethoven for the BBC Radio 3 proved to
be a fine showcase for his refinement and elegant control.
There has never been anything ostentatious about Ranki's playing. Haydn's F
minor Andante and Variations were unfolded with an easy, slightly melancholy
grace; every particle became so beautifully focused that a momentary lack of
precision, a flurry of semiquavers out of kilter in the second variation,
was made to seem a major miscalculation, even though poise was immediately
restored for the coda.
Beethoven's E flat major sonata Op. 31 no. 3 was similarly adroit,
consistently illuminated by Ranki's scrupulous concern for voicing and
balance. The shading imparted to the opening phrase, the weight transferred
gradually from left hand to right as the tone colour was allowed to open
out, was characteristic of the care he lavished on every aspect of the
sonata. It was capped by a scherzo of unflagging buoyancy, each line
wonderfully articulated, and a finale of plain good humour.
Between variations and sonata Ranki offered a group of a dozen pieces out of
Gyorgy Kurtag's collection Jatekok ('Games'), child-like but never childish
explorations of the simplest ideas - a single note, a single chord, a
glissando. To an artist of Ranki's sophistication and accomplishment the
miniatures offer a wonderful opportunity to demonstrate how effective it can
be when the most straightforward things are executed effortlessly, and
difficulties made to seem straightforward.
Another non-appearance at the Royal Festival Hall by Martha Argerich; she
was to have played there on Sunday, with the Philharmonia under Claus Peter
Flor. On this occasion there was at least a substantial measure of
compensation in the substitute: the young Argentinian Nelson Goerner, most
recent prizewinner of the Geneva Piano Competition.
I heard him for the first time last summer, when he stepped in at the
Granges de Meslay Festival at Tours for an equally elusive front-rank
virtuoso, Sviatoslav Richter, and acquitted himself with memorable poise and
naturalness. On Sunday it took him all of the first movement of Mozart's C
minor concerto, K. 491, to fine down the edgy brightness of his delivery and
calm a tendency to run nervously ahead of the beat. But once disciplined to
the services of the music, that same mercurial spirit touched on the sublime
unease of the concerto with remarkable vividness.
In the finale, Goerner's spontaneous responsiveness to the dramatic pull of
the argument was balanced by his beautifully weighted delivery, with limpid,
shapely, and at the same time 'personal' insights in every bar. With
partnering less insensitively brisk and bandmasterly than Flor's, he would
surely have made an even more positive impression; in any event he has
successfully argued the case for a return invitation.

<TEXT>
The National Gallery has secured its Holbein, one of the paintings on its
'most wanted' list. It was confirmed yesterday that 'Portrait of a lady with
a pet squirrel and a starling' will go on show at Trafalgar Square from
April 28. Its owner, Lord Cholmondeley, accepted Pounds 10m net under a
private treaty sale, which makes the gross valuation of the painting about
Pounds 14.5m.
This success, after long and tortuous negotiations, is a triumph for three
men - Neil MacGregor, director of the National Gallery, who led the campaign
to keep the Holbein in the UK; Jack Baer, of dealers Hazlett Gooden &amp; Fox,
who undertook the negotiations on the Gallery's behalf; and Lord Charteris,
of the National Heritage Fund, who today celebrates his last day as chairman
by providing the Pounds 3m which clinched the deal.
Originally Lord Cholmondeley, who needs the money to shore up Houghton Hall,
his Norfolk seat, was advised to sell the painting at auction, through
Christie's on April 15. A price in excess of Pounds 15m was anticipated, but
the Marquess would have had to pay tax of around 60 per cent on the hammer
price.
To avoid this he suggested that the William Kent furnishings at Houghton
should be offered to the nation in lieu of tax while remaining at the Hall.
This would have made a mockery of the acceptance in lieu provisions.
With the National Gallery's annual purchase grant frozen at Pounds 2.75m for
the past six years, a package had to be assembled involving the heritage
bodies. In the event the National Heritage Fund contributed Pounds 3.5m and
there was also a donation from the National Arts Collections Fund. But the
bulk of the cash, which the Marquess will receive over three years, comes
from the National Gallery committing its future purchase grants.
Obviously, after this success it will not be in a position to make any
important acquisitions in the foreseeable future, although it does have
another purchase fund, financed by J. Paul Getty, that it can use in an
emergency. The Getty money helped to purchase the Holbein.
Christie's may be relieved at the private treaty sale. It will not gain its
10 per cent buyer's commission on the hammer price, but it will receive a
sweetener for its part in the negotiations, and it will not have to risk
offering the painting at auction on an uncertain market.
To get the same amount of cash for Lord Cholmondeley at auction Christie's
would have had to find a buyer willing to pay around Pounds 27m.

FT  01 APR 92 / Arts: King Henry IV Part 1
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Adrian Noble's production of King Henry IV opened unevenly at Stratford a
year ago, but improved considerably as the season went on and fell into
shape when we saw Part 2 a few weeks later. Part 1 has now arrived at the
Barbican and looks better than ever.
One of the reasons is the maturing of Robert Stephens's Falstaff. In the
early days at Stratford, he seemed altogether too clean and too likeable.
Although he drank a lot, he did not seem vastly to overdo it. He was more a
cynic than a coward. I compared him at the time to a QC at the Old Bailey.
Now he has grown fatter and more dissolute. No-one seeing this production
will be tempted to come down entirely on his side. The sight of Falstaff
sticking his sword in the already dead Hotspur at the end is thoroughly
unpleasant, and rightly so.
The production as a whole has become much more structured. Partly this is
because of the size of the wonderful Barbican stage. There is room to let
the play develop and give it its full historical sweep: room, too, for point
and counterpoint. An obvious example is the mock trial where Falstaff plays
the king passing judgment on Prince Hal. It is much more poignant than at
Stratford precisely because it is not cluttered: the whole stage is not used
here, leaving a void to suggest what a small part of the world is the inn at
Eastcheap.
A smaller but no less telling illustration is the symmetry between Hotspur
and Mortimer saying goodbye to their wives before setting off to battle.
They are quite beautifully juxtaposed.
Symmetry indeed has become the key note of the production. Julian Glover's
king ponders on the similarities between his own ascent to the throne and
the possibility that he will be overthrown in turn. He envies the one-time
kingmaker, Northumberland, because his son, Hotspur, seems so much more born
to the role of king than Hal, the heir apparent. Michael Maloney's Hal
broods on the comparison that he knows his father makes.
At the same time, both the king and Hal are essentially peace-loving at
heart, if only because the king has learned from experience the bitterness
of civil war. All that comes out more clearly at the Barbican than it did at
Stratford. The battle scenes are also more subtlely handled: some of the
pointless thrashing about in the dark has been eliminated.
It is possible that I overpraise because I know from Stratford how Noble
develops his themes in Part 2. Rarely can the two parts have been played
together so well. After 3 1/2 hours at the Barbican it seemed as if the
second interval had arrived and one could have straight back into the second
part when the king comes into his own and you realise that he is the
dominant figure of his age.
But for that you will have to wait a few more weeks. For my part, I look
forward to Maloney playing Henry V.

FT  01 APR 92 / Central skills that most teaching neglects: Jobs - Request
to readers generates more heat than light over question of the value of
formal education
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL DIXON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE meaning of the crudely drawn chicken would be clear enough even without
the date beneath showing precisely where the charge of cowardice is aimed.
Whoever sent the drawing was referring to the Jobs column's failure to
fulfil its promise to report on the response to a request it put to readers
16 weeks ago.
The focus of the request was education, and my hope in making it was that
readers would shed light on a question I was unable to resolve during my 20
years as the FT's education correspondent up to 1988. The question is what
practical use is the process, except as a source of the academic examination
passes often arbitrarily deemed necessary for entry into well paid lines of
career?
So I asked you to think of the teachers you had in your formal education,
and identify those who taught you something of actual use to you now.
The response was 23 letters, which made up for their modest numbers by being
sometimes several thousand words long. And what probably accounts for the
chicken is that a good quarter of those who wrote were contentious if not
downright bellicose in tone - including one signing himself just 'Joe Soap'
who, for all I know, may fancy his skill as a cartoonist to boot.
The nub of the warlike eight letters was that the only proper response to
anybody who poses such queries about education, is the one reputedly given
by Fats Waller to a woman who asked him what rhythm was: 'If you has to ask,
you ain't got it.' In their view, it seems, the benefits of education are
such that no one who has gained them needs to question them, and anyone who
hasn't would not understand the answer anyway.
Well, perhaps so . . . but it strikes me, at least, as a claim which shrouds
education in the sort of mystery it supposedly exists to dispel. Indeed,
folk taking that line of argument seem to be speaking of education just as
God was spoken of by a church poster I once saw, which read: 'A God small
enough for everybody's understanding would not be big enough for everyone's
needs'.
While that may be true of the Almighty, it can scarcely apply to education
which, after all, is a process both made and carried on by fallible human
beings. Moreover, one of its professed purposes is to enable mere humans to
understand such things.
Fortunately, from my viewpoint, the holier-than-thou ripostes were in the
minority. The other 15 who wrote reflected on their experience of teachers,
as I had asked. Most of them also accepted that, although the aims of
education go beyond the practical, including spiritual and other civilising
development, the process ought to teach us something specifically useful
too.
The most depressing reply was from a man who had built up his own
international consultancy, thereby earning enough money to retire at an age
to enjoy his leisure. He'd looked back on his years at school and
university, he said, but could recall little of positive note. 'One or two
teachers showed moments of kindness, and one even liked the fact that I was
intelligent and knowledgable, but mostly as I try to remember I just feel
time-calmed revulsion.'
By contrast, the remaining 14 could all identify teachers - albeit not
always by name - who had taught them something still of practical help. The
only trouble was that, far from shedding fresh light on the question I
failed to resolve in two decades as an education correspondent, they just
duplicated what I had found from putting the same request to some hundreds
of people during those years.
As before, none of the people who replied identified more than four teachers
who had equipped them with something of actual use now, and the majority
recalled at best three. Those cited usually included one or two at the
primary stage who had imparted the basic skills of reading, writing and
numbering. In the case of those at later stages, the useful thing that had
been taught often had little if any direct connection with the academic
subject the teacher was employed to teach.
For example, one reply cited 'the chemistry master who introduced me to
Plato', as well as the head of a school who led a weekly current-affairs
seminar in which he insisted on his pupils' developing public-speaking
skills.
So despite readers' efforts, I am stuck with the same impressions that I had
before they made them. One in particular is that, since people who have had
as many as 40 teachers seem unable to cite more than four who taught
something still useful, the teaching process is of dubious efficiency. A
second, more general, is that education is at best dimly understood.
But the fact that the original question remains unresolved does not make it
any the less important. The truth is quite the reverse.
One reason is that the foremost benefit of education to at least some of its
recipients - that of awarding them exam passes which serve as a passport
into well paid lines of career - has been devalued by the latest recession.
In Britain at any rate, even honours degrees are now a drug on the jobs
market unless they are seen as directly applicable to productive work.
Hence education's effectiveness in teaching things of actual use is more
central now than before. And it is especially so in Britain with the onset
of a general election in which all main parties are pledged to maintain if
not increase the amounts of taxpayers' money spent on educational processes.
Given their apparently low efficiency in equipping people with practical
abilities, how can a country on its uppers be confident the investment will
have a worthwhile return?
If anyone is being chicken about the topic, it is surely those who advocate
high spending without being prepared to explain how the expected pay-off
will be achieved. Accordingly, I rest my case.
N OW to a couple of jobs of which the first, being handled by John McManus
of the John Courtis and Partners consultancy, is somewhat ironically with
the trustees of the UK Universities Superannuation Scheme.
The trustee company U S S, limited by guarantee and located in Liverpool, is
in need of a new pensions manager for its scheme which has over 90,000
members and investments of more than Pounds 6bn. As one of the senior
management team, the recruit will have strategic responsibilities ranging
beyond the job's technical duties. So besides being successful at pensions
management, candidates must have general management skills.
The salary indicator is Pounds 50,000. Perks include a car.
Inquiries to Mr McManus at 104 Marylebone Lane, London W1M 5FU; telephone
071-486 6849, fax 071-487 4600.
The other opening is with an international bank in the City of London, and
offered by recruiter Dudley Edmunds of Westminster Associates International
(1-4 Warwick St, London W1R 5WB; tel 071-287 5788, fax 071-287 9986). As he
may not name the employer, he promises to abide by applicant's requests not
to be identified to his client at this stage.
The job is primarily for an expert spot trader in US dollars and D-marks.
But Mr Edmunds says candidates must also be skilled at taking short-term
positions, and at trading in other currencies. Moreover they'll need 'the
intellect to use derivative products to hedge their position when required.'
Salary around Pounds 90,000, plus bonus on results. Rest negotiable.

FT  01 APR 92 / Election 1992: Two-horse race - Ballot Box
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Tory leadership race has begun, at least, at the bookies.
Those who think that the grey, currently at the head of the Conservative
pack, may be an early faller might be interested to learn that William Hill
has just taken a bet on a mare with form as long as your arm.
Someone the bookmaker describes as 'a very well informed client' has bet
Pounds 20 at 25/1 that Margaret Thatcher will regain the leadership of the
Tory party before the end of the century.
Another Pounds 20, this time at 50/1, says she will return to 10 Downing
Street.
Meanwhile, it has been a long wait for the man who had a bet on next
Thursday's big race nearly three years ago. Patience, however, can be
rewarded; he wagered Pounds 40,000 to win Pounds 110,000 that Labour would
gain the most seats.
Walk into any bookmaker today with Pounds 40,000 to place on the same bet
and you would collect not much more than Pounds 13,000.
Victor Chandler, the bookmaker which laid the bet in June 1989, will not
disclose the client's name, saying only that he is 'a leading entrepreneur'.
Yet whoever he is, his winnings will be nothing like a political record.
Ahead of the 1964 election, Sir Maxwell Joseph, founder of Grand
Metropolitan, placed a bet of Pounds 50,000 - that is not far short Pounds
500,000 today - on a not unexpected Labour victory. He collected more than
Pounds 32,000.

FT  01 APR 92 / Election 1992: Lawyers galore - Ballot Box
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
No fewer than 160 lawyers are standing for parliament this time round -
surely a record no other profession can match. As has traditionally been the
case, 'M'learn'd friends' outnumber 'Messrs Inter Alia'. There are 91
barristers standing (61 Tories, 20 Labour and 10 Lib Dems), compared with 69
solicitors (42 Tories, 14 Lib Dems, 11 Labour and two Plaid Cymru).
Why so many? The Bar has always been regarded as a sound platform for a
career in politics - largely it seems because the courts rise at 4.30pm,
allowing just enough time for the aspiring politician to nip down from the
Temple to Westminster for important debates. Advocacy in one place goes with
advocacy in another.
It is less obvious why so many solicitors are attracted. Still, the Law
Society is taking full advantage. It has produced a 46-page election special
covering a range of issues from legal-aid pay to the role of solicitors in
developing legislation. Prospective legal parliamentary candidates are
expected to take them up.

FT  01 APR 92 / Election 1992: Voters tuned in - Ballot Box
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Here, perhaps, is one of the biggest electoral surprises. Voters are far
from bored by the television coverage and are not switching off.
The newly available Broadcasting Audience Research Bureau (BARB) figures for
the first full week of the campaign show modestly increased audiences for
some news bulletins, while current-affairs programmes are holding on to
respectable audiences.
The biggest increases are for news bulletins at lunch and teatime. The BBC's
One O'Clock News had an average audience of 4.3m, compared with the 1991
average of 3.8m. ITN's 12.30 news held steady at 2.4m. The BBC's Six O'Clock
News was marginally up - 7.6m versus 7.4m  - but ITN's News at 5.40 rose
from a 5.6m average to 6.2m.
Viewers' patience for politics, however, seems to flag as the evening wears
on. The BBC's Nine O'Clock News - very much the flagship  - is down from
7.2m last year to 6.4m, and ITN News at Ten is down significantly more -
from 6.7m to 5.3m. Newsnight and Channel 4 are holding their own around the
1m mark.
In the battle between the BBC and ITV, it looks at present like a hung BARB,
with the BBC perhaps slightly in front.

FT  01 APR 92 / Election 1992: Smoking gun fires blanks - Ballot Box
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It is not the smoking gun of this general election.
A leaked policy document on economic strategy prepared by one of John
Smith's advisers had some of the Tory tabloids yesterday conjuring up
chilling images of devaluation, tax increases and spending cuts under
Labour.
Their problem was that the paper was written two years ago - before the
present recession and before John Major took sterling into the exchange rate
mechanism. Neil Kinnock briskly disowned it.
For all that, the paper provides a fascinating insight into the problems
that an incoming Labour government would face - and of the policy options
which are likely to be floating around if Smith makes it to the Treasury.
The author was Andrew Graham, a Balliol don who has been helping to
reformulate Labour's economic strategy since 1987.
Well before the recession took its toll on public finances he was addressing
the dilemmas that would face an incoming government: meeting its spending
commitments without sparking runaway borrowing and inflation, and closing
the trade gap by making British industry more competitive.
It was Graham's preferred responses which provided the tabloids with their
ammunition. His first was devaluation (he assumed correctly the pound would
be in the ERM) to boost industrial competitiveness. His second was a tax
increase to meet some of its spending commitments. His third was a deal with
public-sector workers gradually to close the pay gap with the private
sector.
But what is striking about the document is its almost self-conscious
sobriety. Devaluation, it suggests, should be accompanied by a squeeze on
domestic demand to direct resources into the overseas sector and by a firm
commitment to lock the exchange rate into European monetary union
thereafter. The government would have to accept high unemployment as a fact
of life. A tight fiscal policy would demand either spending cuts or tax
increases.
Smith can claim that none of these options are Labour policy. But if he
makes it to 11 Downing Street, he might do worse than look again at the
analysis.

FT  01 APR 92 / Election 1992: Labour details education plans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LABOUR BROUGHT education under the election spotlight yesterday by spelling
out how it would allocate Pounds 600m in extra funding for schools and
colleges.
At a national news conference held at Salford University, Mr Neil Kinnock
said policies, such as assisted places schemes, had created a two-tier
system that 'mocks the idea of the classless society that the Conservatives
say they want.'
Labour would raise investment in schools. 'It's time to get back to basics -
more qualified teachers, new books, better buildings,' he said.
Mr Kenneth Clarke, education secretary, dismissed the extra cash, arguing
that it was no guarantee of raising standards. He said the Pounds 600m boost
promised compared with the Pounds 4.8bn extra spent by the Conservatives in
the two years he had been education secretary.
Setting out Labour's additional spending programme, Mr Jack Straw, the
education spokesman, said Pounds 448m of the Pounds 600m put aside in the
shadow Budget for the next 22 months had been allocated to England.
The remaining Pounds 152m would go to Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales,
and also included an undisclosed figure for contingencies.
He detailed the programmes set to benefit from the new funding as follows:
school repairs, attracting the largest sum of Pounds 130m for capital
spending, plus Pounds 30m to eliminate outdoor lavatories;
a further Pounds 120m for new school books, calculated at Pounds 10 per
pupil, almost doubling the existing allocation;
new classroom equipment for older children at a cost of Pounds 40m;
Pounds 20m each for cutting the size of larger classes, a national reading
standards programme and the creation of student housing and hardship funds;
a further Pounds 10m on hiring 'mentors' to advise new teachers in their
first years at work;
an already announced Pounds 68m childcare programme, also funded from the
Budget windfall.
The education manifesto, entitled 'It's Time to Modernise Our Schools',
reiterates Labour's commitment to provide nursery education for all
three-year-olds or four-year-olds whose parents want it by the year 2000.
It also pledges to switch Pounds 50m in funding allocated to the City
Technology Colleges into the nursery system.
Mr Straw said Labour would 'steadily increase' investment in education.

FT  01 APR 92 / Election 1992: Trading places on Derby day - The battle for
some key Conservative marginals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEXT door to the Tea Cosy tea rooms in the Derbyshire village of Codnor the
Tory campaign headquarters for Amber Valley is preparing for another day on
the stump. A Volkswagen van with two wooden garden seats bolted to the floor
has been loaned as a 'battlebus'.
Portraits of Winston Churchill, Margaret Thatcher and John Major stare down
on the party machine - a schoolboy taking time out of lessons, a few
stalwarts and a mongrel dog called Vom. His full name is Vomit and he
belongs to Phillip Oppenheim who has been the sitting MP since 1983.
A few miles away the process is being repeated as another group of
campaigners marches out of the Labour party office in Ripley. The groups
look much the same. Only the candidates differ in their dress; one wearing
jeans, the other dressed quite stiffly in a buff-coloured military overcoat.
It's the sort of coat that would get you past the doorman at the Carlton
Club, and John Cooper, the Labour candidate, is rather proud of it. Tories
can own mongrels and socialists can jut out their chins in John Major's
classless society. Cooper, 33, is a barrister, playwright, and a product of
comprehensive education. Oppenheim, the 37-year-old son of Baroness
Oppenheim-Barnes, former minister for consumer affairs, comes from a long
line of steel barons. He went to Harrow.
The seat is one of a clutch of Derbyshire Tory marginals that could tumble
if Labour's bandwagon is strong enough to effect an 8 per cent swing.
Such a swing could also dethrone Edwina Currie in Derbyshire South and would
almost certainly unseat Greg Knight in Derby North.
John Beadle, Labour's veteran election agent for Derby North and Derby South
(where Margaret Beckett, the shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, has a
3.5 per cent majority) has spelled out the importance of Derby: 'We will not
get a Labour government without Labour MPs from Derby North and South.'
To give Labour an overall majority at Westminster it must look a little
further north to the Erewash, High Peak and Amber Valley constituencies,
which all require a swing of around 9 per cent. The closeness of the race
suggests High Peak and Erewash may be beyond Labour.
But Oppenheim in Amber Valley is perhaps the most vulnerable of all the
sitting Conservative MPs in the Derbyshire marginals, in spite of his larger
majority.
He, more than any of the Derbyshire Tory candidates, has enjoyed the
benefits of a peculiarly Derbyshire phenomenon in the last two elections.
It's called the Bookbinder factor and it is fast fading away.
David Bookbinder, the man Mrs Thatcher described as her least favourite
local government leader, stood down as head of Derbyshire County Council at
the weekend, triggering a Tory wake and a huge sigh of relief from Labour
activists as soon as they had mourned his passing. For years the
Matlock-based council had waved a red rag at the Tories, starving police of
resources, subsidising school dinners and closing branch libraries when
faced with caps on spending.
A local freesheet newspaper waged a relentless campaign against him and the
taunts struck home.
In a seat which Oppenheim never expected to take, he defeated Bookbinder in
1983 and increased his majority when he faced him again in 1987. How much of
that vote was a reflection of Bookbinder's unpopularity with the electorate
is difficult to guage but even Oppenheim concedes it must have counted for
thousands rather than hundreds of votes.
This time he faces a confident and purposeful candidate in Cooper, who could
take the seat on a much smaller national swing to Labour. It makes Amber
Valley perhaps the most vulnerable of the Derbyshire Tory seats.
Its neighbour, Erewash, would need a slightly smaller swing to go to Labour.
But Sean Stafford, the Labour candidate, is fighting with the handicap of
being the deputy leader of the county council and with a pending court
appearance on charges of making false expenses claims and perverting the
course of justice which he plans to defend. The Derby Evening Telegraph has
made sure that the electorate is fully aware of this local version of a
double whammy.
And how safe is Currie in Derbyshire South? Again, on paper it would take an
8 per cent swing to Labour for her to lose. But demographic changes in her
constituency and Tory successes in the last local elections within her seat
should ensure she gets back.

<TEXT>
If last night's polls are right, Mr Neil Kinnock's Labour party is on the
way to becoming the undisputed winner on Friday week. A single set of polls
in mid-campaign is not, however, conclusive, especially on All Fools day.
Yet the election is beginning to run to a pattern, deadly for the Tories.
They started with a poor hand and have played it badly. They chose the
deepest point of a long recession as voting day and ran a campaign that is
the second-worst since Mr Michael Foot's disastrous circus of 1983. On last
night's figures, it looks as if only a huge mistake by Labour, or an
unpredictable mind-changing event can save them now.
We paid-up members of the Hang Parliament party are prepared for the worst.
For the one prospect we have all along regarded with about as much
foreboding as an overall majority under the control of Mr Neil Kinnock is a
renewed overall majority under Mr John Major. Both have done their utmost to
bamboozle the electorate. Mr Kinnock pretends that there is such a thing as
an egalitarian health system to be had for a mere Pounds 1bn plus a
statement of good intentions; Mr Major that pinning name badges on the
lapels of civil servants elevates subjects to the status of citizens.
The former prevaricates when he presents a manifesto that seems to promise,
yet does not guarantee, steadily increasing public expenditure. The latter
stretches the boundaries of honest discourse when he talks of annual tax
cuts but says he cannot be certain that they will be deliverable every year.
Both know that we can afford neither reduced taxation nor additional
spending. Mr Kinnock wriggles his way around this by intimating that Labour
will stimulate highly unlikely rates of growth; Mr Major does likewise for
the Conservatives.
I leave aside Mr Paddy Ashdown, for there is no chance of his Liberal
Democrats winning any kind of a majority. He is running for the coveted post
of elected dictator, but he is certain to come third. That is a blessing.
What Hang Parliament supporters dream of is new parties and coalition
government.
Such a thing is alien to the British parliamentary tradition. That is why,
attractive as it may be, genuine electoral reform for the commons is likely
to be resisted by both the larger parties, albeit with greater determination
by theConservatives than by Labour. It is mere wishful thinking to regard a
hung parliament as the inevitable precursor of constitutional reform.
Such a parliament would nevertheless be better than one put back to sleep by
another overall majority. The House of Commons comes alive when
administrations have to trouble themselves to count probable votes for every
bill they invent. After 1987 the Tories had a majority of 100-plus. Power
went to their heads. They forced the poll tax through. It was nearly
emasculated by a backbench revolt. Had there been a hung parliament the
attempt might never have been made.
Next time it could be different. Absent a Labour landslide, the smaller
parties might separate the big two. The assorted Celtic nationalists might
account for between 25 and 30 seats; the Liberal Democrats for as many
again. The likely performance of Mr Ashdown's candidates is, however, one of
the more unpredictable factors in this election campaign.
On the bare figures they could lose half a dozen or more of their current
total of 22 seats. Our FT poll-of-polls program tracks the moving average of
the six most recent polls. The result is weighted by sample size. Six months
ago the Liberal Democrats stood at fractionally under 14 per cent; now they
are at 18 1/2 per cent. This is an impressive performance for a party that
had crumbled barely three years ago, but it is 4 percentage points below the
1987 performance of the then Alliance. Even if you include the most recent
polls showing 19 per cent and 20 per cent there are still three points to
go.
The conventional wisdom has it that simple arithmetic will not accurately
predict the number of Liberal Democrat seats. They are adept at hanging on
to constituencies where they are already incumbent. They may make some
gains, particularly around Devon and Cornwall. If there is a general
anti-Tory feeling in the country, tactical voters will favour Mr Ashdown's
candidates where they stand the best chance of toppling a sitting
Conservative. So they might improve on their present 22.
There is a contrary supposition. This is that most of the increase in
Liberal Democrat support represents disgruntled Tories registering a
protest. There is some evidence for this in recent polls, which show Labour
holding steady while the Conservatives fall back and the Liberal Democrats
rise. Such ex-Conservative voters may scuttle back home if Labour looks like
forming a government. This is what happened in certain key constituencies,
including Mr Ashdown's, after 'wobbly Thursday' in 1987.
In 1992 Conservatives cannot bank on such a phenomenon. They can only hope
that Mr Major's recent return to gutsy street-fighting is working. No, I
don't believe it either.

<TEXT>
SHARES that might benefit from a Labour victory suffered one of their
steepest drops of the campaign as the 'Labour gainers' section of the index
slid a full point. Eight of the 10 shares fell and two were unchanged.
'Conservative gainers' did less badly, dropping by only a  1/4 of a point -
a decline that was only half that suffered by the FT-SE index of big-company
stocks.
The FT Election Share index is based on closing prices on March 11, the day
the election was called. Since then Labour gainers have dropped by 2 points,
and Conservative gainers by 6 1/2 points.

FT  01 APR 92 / Election 1992: Tax looms large in sea views - The Issues:
Personal Finance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TAX is one of the central planks of the Conservatives' campaign. Judging by
the savers and investors of Worthing, a south-coast resort where a high
proportion of residents live off retirement income, the issue strikes home
with the Tories' core supporters.
The private investors of the quiet streets and seaside views of the West
Sussex town, where the Conservative Mr Terence Higgins is defending a 18,500
majority, stand fairly solidly behind Mr John Major.
Labour's policy shifts have not impressed them. On the basis of Mr John
Smith's alternative Budget, few would be worse off and some would gain from
the pensions increase. One has to be very wealthy to enjoy investment income
of more than Pounds 40,000 a year - the rate at which Labour's 50 per cent
tax would apply - and retired people would not be hit by abolition of the
Pounds 405 per week National Insurance ceiling. Labour has also dropped a
planned 9 per cent surcharge on investment income.
Nevertheless, the general belief is that whatever Labour says now, it would
significantly raise taxes for everyone when in office. Mr Cecil Thriscutt, a
residential landlord, says: 'John Smith puts his case over better than
Lamont but there is the shadow of previous Labour treatment of high income
tax and interest rates.'
Mr Frank O'Mahony, a retired headmaster, says: 'I go by past records and I
remember Labour's 83 per cent tax rate. They will wear their old spots once
they are in power.'
Memories of the 1974-79 Labour government are strong. 'The record proves
that they cannot keep inflation down,' says Mr Kenneth Finney, a former
telecommunications executive.
Mr Neil Kinnock is particularly unpopular. 'I don't trust him,' says Mr John
Cameron, a retired civil servant. 'He's made more twists and turns than
Torvill and Dean.'
Part of Labour's problem may be that its case does not get through. In spite
of repeated denials that it will reduce the capital gains tax threshold to
Pounds 1,000, Tory-supporting newspapers and one of the country's largest
financial-adviser groups, Noble Lowndes, were last weekend describing this
as Labour policy. Capital gains tax, which was only paid by 165,000 people
last year, is probably not an important issue. But Mr Major seems to have
struck a chord with his plans to reduce the inheritance tax burden. Mr
Thriscutt says: 'When you've worked hard and want to leave your property to
your family, it's a bit galling when the government takes a huge chunk
away.'
On inheritance tax, Labour has indicated that it would like to move to a
recipient-based levy, but the party has not spelled out its plans.
The various tax shelters the Conservatives have introduced, such as Peps
(personal equity plans) and Tessas (tax-exempt special savings accounts) did
not seem to arouse much enthusiasm in Worthing. Investors were aware of the
opportunities to save tax, but many cautiously kept their funds in property
or building societies.
Labour's plans on these issues have at times lacked clarity. Ms Mo Mowlam,
one of the party's Treasury team, said last year: 'We would not continue the
tax relief to Peps.' But another of the team, Mr Chris Smith, said earlier
this year: 'We don't have any intention of sweeping them (Peps) away.'
Instead, Labour might create an expanded version of the Pep, with bonds and
cash products included.
It would be wrong to say support for the Tories among savers in Worthing is
unanimous. Mr John Hamill, a retired tax expert with advisers Wilfred T.
Fry, was planning to vote Labour because he would not mind paying one or two
pence in the pound for improved public services. Mrs Jean Cameron, a former
secretary, was inclined to vote Liberal Democrat because of the party's
education plans.
Mr Chris Dale, a management consultant, described himself as a floating
voter, saying that neither party had policies to encourage the growth of
manufacturing industry along the lines followed by Japan's Ministry of
International Trade and Industry.
But for many Worthing savers support for the Tories is a tribal loyalty,
best summed up by Mr Finney: 'The Conservatives look after the middle
classes.'

FT  01 APR 92 / Election 1992: Polls reflect concern over health policies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY and GARETH SMYTH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A DELAYED reaction to Labour's health broadcast and adverse voter reaction
to Conservative 'negative campaigning' were the reasons Mr Neil Kinnock's
team gave for the sharp upturn in his campaign's poll fortunes yesterday.
At least part of that thesis appeared to be borne out in the detailed
figures behind the Mori poll for The Times. It showed 56 per cent naming the
National Health Service as their chief concern - a 10-point rise from the
beginning of the election campaign.
A total of 53 per cent of voters believed that the NHS was unsafe in Mr John
Major's hands, against 38 per cent who held that it was safe.
Worse still for the Conservatives, 57 per cent do not believe the
government's assurances that it would not privatise the NHS, against 32 per
cent accepting its word.
The findings were also damaging for Conservative strategists. Some 65 per
cent of Liberal Democrats and 56 per cent of Labour supporters believed
their parties had the best campaigns. Only 24 per cent of Tories would make
the same claim. Tax was named by only 15 per cent of all polled as likely to
affect their vote.
The Harris poll for ITN showed a fall in Tory support among women and
semi-skilled workers, designated C2s. Support had fallen five points among
both groups to 36 points and 28 points respectively.
In the ICM poll for The Guardian 81 per cent of Labour supporters said they
were certain to vote, against 83 per cent for the Liberal Democrats but 76
per cent for the Tories.
A poll by Bath University put Mr Chris Patten, the Conservative party
chairman, on 39.5 per cent, one point behind the Liberal Democrat challenger
Mr Don Foster. The poll sample was 871 and the university quoted a 3.5 per
cent margin of error.
A local poll in Birmingham Northfield suggested that Labour is set to
capture the marginal seat from the Tories.

FT  01 APR 92 / Election 1992: Lang is caught in the crossfire
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN Ian Lang, the Scottish secretary, embarked a few months ago on an
election strategy aimed at splitting the Labour vote in Scotland, he was
always the most likely person to be shot down in the crossfire.
Yesterday's opinion poll in his own Galloway constituency, putting him seven
points behind his Scottish National party opponent, gave the first detailed
evidence that this may indeed be the case.
It was a sign that April 9 could be a catastrophe for the Scottish Tories to
match the one in June 1987, when they lost 11 seats. Two other Tories
fighting strong challenges from the SNP in rural constituencies could also
be doomed: Mr Bill Walker, with a majority of 5,000 in Tayside North, and
Sir Nicholas Fairbairn with 5,600 in Perth and Kinross.
With Labour snapping at the Tories' heels in Ayr and Stirling, the Scottish
Conservatives could lose five of the nine seats they still hold in Scotland,
which elects 72 MPs.
Mr Lang had to try to make the best of the Tories' wretched hand in
campaigning for the party in Scotland. He knew many Scots simply wanted to
get the Conservatives out after 13 years in which they have ruled Scotland
with a dwindling minority of MPs. The Tories had ignored majority Scottish
opinion on most issues, imposed the poll tax a year earlier than south of
the border and became seen as the English party, especially because of their
rejection of a devolved Scottish parliament.
Mr Lang, who has not been an inspiring secretary of state, realised it was
too late for any plausible last-minute conversion to devolution - which
anyway was anathema to half his party. He gambled that by presenting the
constitutional debate as a straight choice between the status quo and
independence he would split the anti-Tory vote, as well as rally support for
the union.
For weeks up to the election was called he said little against the SNP but
rubbished Labour and its plan for a devolved parliament. Since then the
Tories have attacked all parties.
So far the balance sheet contains more red ink than black. The SNP has about
27 per cent support in Scottish polls, at which it can win the three Tory
rural seats but not make big gains from Labour. Support for the union has
not moved decisively upwards, and backing for the Tory party has been static
at about 22 per cent.
Yet gloom is not universal. 'My campaign is going excellently,' said Mr
Struan Stevenson, the Tory candidate for Edinburgh South, who is fighting to
overturn Mr Nigel Griffiths' 1,800 majority for Labour in 1987. He says Mr
Neil Kinnock has replaced Mrs Margaret Thatcher as a hate figure; the
Liberal Democrats, who as the Alliance won 22 per cent of the vote last
time, have collapsed; and the SNP is making inroads into Labour's vote among
young people in the housing schemes.
In Stirling, Mr Michael Forsyth, the Scottish education minister and a
strong Thatcherite, is defending a majority of 548. His campaign is 'running
on oiled wheels', according to a senior party official. He is relying on the
SNP taking votes from Labour.
With the Liberal Democrats doing poorly in the Scottish opinion polls (two
polls have put support for them at below 10 per cent) some Tories believe
they can unseat Mr Menzies Campbell in Fife North-East (majority 1,447).
'It's incredibly difficult to predict any of the results where we stand to
win,' says a senior party figure, 'because each is a four-horse race in a
marginal. But you're making a mistake if you think only in terms of the
seats we will probably lose.'
But while Mr Stevenson says he had volunteers turning up in their wellies at
7.30am yesterday to canvass in the rain, a bleak picture comes from a Tory
worker in a Labour safe seat in industrial Fife.
'Usually in elections people swarm in offering to help,' she says. 'This
time they're just not interested. We haven't got enough people for
canvassing, we just mail out leaflets. Our appeal for contributions to our
fighting fund produced virtually nothing, even from companies. It's terribly
depressing.'

FT  01 APR 92 / Election 1992: Kinnock accused of CND cover-up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL, DAVID OWEN and IVOR OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LABOUR leadership was yesterday accused by the Conservatives of covering
up the fact that at least 24 of its candidates had been members of the
Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament.
On the eve of a planned Tory attack on Labour defence policy, Mr Chris
Patten, the Tory party chairman, challenged Mr Neil Kinnock to disclose how
many of his party's candidates were still CND members. Last night's
Conservative party election broadcast portrayed the Labour party and Mr
Kinnock in particular as being unsuitable to take charge of Britain's
defences. The broadcast claimed that at least 100 Labour MPs in the last
parliament were CND members.
Mr Patten has written to Mr Kinnock insisting that the public has the right
to know how many Labour candidates are CND members. He wrote: 'Your
shameless cover-up of Labour's strong and continuing links with unilateral
disarmers cannot be allowed to continue any more.'
Documents released by Conservative Central Office along with yesterday's
broadcast suggested that all references to CND membership planned for
inclusion in Labour's official list of candidates had been removed. Only Mr
Bruce Kent, the former chairman of CND who is standing in Oxford West and
Abingdon, has his CND connections mentioned.
Responding to the broadcast last night, Ms Marjorie Thomson, chair of CND,
said: 'The Conservative party is more concerned with leading a McCarthyite
witch hunt on the membership of CND than in addressing the real defence need
of this country.'
Mr Tom King, defence secretary, rounded on Mr Gerald Kaufman, shadow foreign
secretary, who claimed earlier this month that his party had 'nothing
whatever to do with CND'.
Mr King said the attempt by the party leadership to cover up CND links was
'a manifest fraud'. Labour had 165 'anti-nuclear' MPs seeking re-election
and another 85 candidates with the same views standing for the first time.
Mr King said Labour was determined to ensure that defence did not become an
issue. The constitution of CND included the unilateral, unconditional
rejection of nuclear weapons, a stance which could not be squared with
Labour's election manifesto.

FT  01 APR 92 / Election 1992: A 1980s flagship set for a change of tack -
Bristol, where the electorate mirrors the nation as a whole
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRISTOL, capital of south-west England, holds a peculiar fascination for
psephologists. With roughly the same socio-economic breakdown as that of
Britain as a whole, it represents the nation in microcosm.
The slave trade, tobacco, aerospace and defence in turn brought prosperity.
The late 1980s brought an influx of service-sector businesses lured from
London by an attractive environment, low costs and easy access along the M4.
For a while, Bristol looked as though it had become an honorary member of
the south-east. By 1983 the Conservatives had four of the city's five seats,
and in 1987 they defied the national trend by increasing their share of the
vote.
Today, Bristol could be ripe for a Labour comeback. Indeed, if Labour is to
stand any chance of triumphing in the election it must do well here.
Bristol prospered in the 1980s. Its defence industry, led by companies such
as Rolls-Royce and British Aerospace, were resilient to the last recession.
When it ended, the service sector fed the city's growth. Now the city is
suffering. A shake-out in financial services has coincided with defence
cuts. BAe and Rolls-Royce alone have shed 2,000 jobs, and unemployment has
shot up from 5.9 per cent to 9.3 per cent over the last year.
Labour's chances of electoral recovery rest on the fact that it can look to
a sizable bedrock of support. Bristol retains a sizable manufacturing base,
a large working class and a Labour city council.
But Labour has a fight on its hands. It is not helped by vestiges of the
wrangle for power between the party's own left and right. The Kinnockites
won the upper hand in the local party, but businessmen still speak with
frustration of the council's alleged anti-business stance, and Labour's one
MP in the city, Dawn Primarolo, is a leftwinger.
Ms Primarolo has not endeared herself to the moderate vote by refusing to
pay her poll tax until served with a liability order. But her Bristol South
seat is a solid working-class constituency, and the fact that she clung to
it amid Labour's poor local performance in 1987 suggests she can only do
better this time.
Winning Tory seats is another matter. One that will not go Labour's way is
William Waldegrave's Bristol West. Although it includes St Paul's, scene of
the notorious 1981 riots, it is dominated by the elegant terraces of Clifton
and the leafy suburbs of Henleaze and Stoke Bishop, and has never voted
anything but Tory.
Labour has two easier targets. Bristol East, a mixed bag but broadly working
class, was captured from Tony Benn by Jonathan Sayeed in 1983 and swung
further to the Tories in 1987 when Labour fielded left-winger Ron Thomas.
This time Jean Corston, a model of Kinnockite orthodoxy, needs only a 4.1
per cent swing to take it back.
An even smaller swing - 3.8 per cent  - is needed to retrieve Kingswood.
This constituency on Bristol's eastern fringe includes just the sort of
owner-occupying skilled workers that Labour needs to win over. The catch is
that the sitting Conservative, Robert Hayward, is a strong constituency man
who commands a personal vote.
The biggest challenge is Bristol North-West. A classic marginal, it has been
won six out of seven times in the past 25 years by the party that has won
the election. Socioeconomically mixed, it takes in the Rolls-Royce and BAe
plants at Filton, and skilled workers make up a significant proportion of
its electorate.
These might just turn the vote against Michael Stern, the somewhat
colourless Conservative incumbent. Many upwardly mobile families moved out
of inner-city terraced houses into the vast Bradley Stoke estate on the
constituency's northern periphery. Heavily mortgaged, they have seen the
value of their property slump. Some have lost their jobs as well.
Robert Fisher, 29, should have been an archetypal Conservative voter. A
fire-protection engineer, he says he is working class, but ambitious. He
moved from Bristol to Canada in 1988 to get a better job and two years later
moved back to a new home in Bradley Stoke for the same reason.
Last year he was poached by a company offering him a career path into
management. The move backfired. Within months he was made redundant. Once in
demand, he has been unable to find a job in his field within 100 miles. He
and his family - his Canadian wife Christine and nine-month-old daughter
Sarah - receive barely enough in income support to pay the mortgage.
It is not for want of trying for other jobs. 'I applied to be a
shelf-stacker at Asda,' he says. 'There were 35 vacancies, but 1,600 to
2,000 people applied. I didn't get the job: they said I was over-qualified.'
Labour needs a swing of 6 per cent to win Bristol North-West. Robert Fisher
says he is going to vote Labour: if there are enough like him Neil Kinnock
could be the next prime minister.

FT  01 APR 92 / Election 1992: Tory manifesto measures steal the show - The
Issues: Arts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN HIS campaign for the US presidency Pat Buchanan has spent lavishly on
advertisments condemning President George Bush's 'permissive' attitude
towards the arts and promising to ensure that the National Endowment for the
Arts, the US equivalent of the Arts Council, was 'shut down, padlocked and
fumigated'.
No such outbursts are likely to enliven the British election campaign. It is
generally agreed that there are few votes in the arts.
The party taking the arts most seriously is, surprisingly, the
Conservatives, which features the arts prominently in its manifesto and
proposes quite dramatic changes. Labour, traditionally the more vociferous
champion of the arts, has few radical proposals.
In recent years the Conservatives have stolen much of Labour's programme,
awarding increases in annual subsidies ahead of inflation and trimming the
Arts Council while encouraging devolution of decisions over specific funding
projects to regional arts boards.
It now proposes a cabinet place for a minister covering the arts,
broadcasting, heritage, tourism and sport.
The ministry will enjoy around Pounds 200m of the revenues from a national
lottery. This money would be devoted mainly to capital costs - shoring up
cathedrals, theatres and museums and projects like building a national dance
house, to mark the millennium.
The Tories also plan to trim the arts bureaucracy. The role of the Arts
Council will be re-examined. It might be left to act as a think-tank for the
arts. Given recent reductions in its funding powers its future cannot be
guaranteed; it might be allowed to maintain the hallowed 'arm's-length'
funding principle by which it sets the grants for the big national companies
such as the Royal Opera House and National Theatre or these companies could
be subsidised directly by the government.
Against this barrage of proposed change Labour's plans look, well,
conservative. It has little new to say about the Arts Council, which it also
sees mainly as a propaganda body for the arts. It is hesitating over a
lottery, saying it does not want to undermine the football pools companies;
and it is stepping gingerly over its old plan to merge ministerial
responsibility for broadcasting with that for the arts.
Labour hopes to increase expenditure on the arts by raising more tax revenue
from commercial interests that exploit the arts, like the record and video
industries, and by forcing local authorities to spend a set percentage of
their revenue on arts projects.
The Liberal Democrats plump for continuity and change, maintaining the Arts
Council, in deference to the arm's-length principle, and guaranteeing BBC
licence-fee funding but also wanting cabinet status for the arts minister
and higher national spending.
The manifestos are more interesting for what they leave out. On the heritage
side, no party has a sensible answer to the increasing loss of important art
treasures abroad because of weak export controls and inadequate museum
funding.
The only obvious source of new money for the arts is the lottery, but
already there are too many supplicants for its theoretical bounty, too many
fears that if it does happen direct government funding will be reduced in
line.
Like much else, the future for the arts depends less on political promises
than on an economic recovery.

FT  01 APR 92 / Election 1992: Opposition buoyed in Southampton
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SOUTHAMPTON's Labour supporters yesterday displayed quiet jubilation over an
opinion poll giving the party a seven-point lead in one of the city's two
seats.
The two Tory MPs in the south-coast marginals, though clearly thrown on to
the defensive, derided the survey as 'maverick' and out of step with
reality.
Mr Alan Whitehead, the ambitious leader of the city's Labour-controlled
council, who is fighting in the Southampton Test constituency, said the city
was 'like another planet' compared with the 1983 and 1987 elections. Mr
Whitehead stood and lost in both those battles. 'Now, we're confident of
winning,' he said.
Evidence of a swing to Labour - given 45 per cent of the vote in Test
against 38 per cent for the Tories in an ICM poll for Today newspaper - was
supported by a sampling of street opinion yesterday.
Five out of 10 people in Shirley High Street, a residential area of
Southampton, said they would vote Labour, including two who backed the
Tories last time. Three declared Conservative allegiances, with one opting
for the Liberal Democrats and one undecided.
A young mother pushing her baby said her high mortgage payments would make
her vote Labour. A matronly volunteer in an Oxfam shop supported the Tories
because of fears about a Labour government. 'I'm not very happy with either
of them,' she confided.
An unemployed youngster starting a training course, opted for Labour
'because the Tories have demolished the country'.
Such defeatism was dismissed yesterday by Mr James Hill, the veteran
Conservative MP for Test, defending a 6,954 majority. To capture Test and
the twin constituency of Itchen, Labour will need a 7 per cent swing.
Mr Hill said the poll would make his supporters try harder. A Labour
government would cause a run on the pound and have to be bailed out by the
International Monetary Fund. Comparing Labour with a 'blusterer' bragging
about his driving prowess, Mr Hill said it might be salutary for Mr Neil
Kinnock to have 'a turn at the wheel'.
Mr Christopher Chope, the Conservative incumbent in Itchen with a 6,716
majority, refused to think the unthinkable. Support was holding up well, he
said.
Mr Chope said he had even taken his campaign to London's Wembley Stadium at
the weekend to see Southampton play Nottingham Forest in the Zenith Data
Systems Cup Final.
Furiously plugging the anti-Labour line, he said Mr Kinnock, if elected,
would kow-tow to the unions. 'His paymasters will be wanting a pay-back,' he
declared.
This was not, Mr Chope admitted while shaking hands with mothers at a local
school yesterday, an election where there was much to be positive about.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
MR IAN LANG, the Scottish secretary, is discovering that success at the
highest level of politics is not always an asset in the fight to keep a seat
in parliament.
Mr Lang won Galloway and Upper Nithsdale, in south-west Scotland, from the
Scottish National party in 1979 and became Scottish secretary in 1990. Now
many of his constituents seem to have decided they would be better off with
an MP who was somewhat less preoccupied with high office.
There has been speculation throughout the campaign that Galloway would
return to the SNP, and there was confirmation of Mr Lang's vulnerability in
a System 3 poll published in yesterday's Herald newspaper.
The poll showed SNP support at 40 per cent in the constituency, with Mr Lang
on 33 per cent and supporters of other parties prepared to vote tactically
against him. He stands to lose a seat where he had a 3,600 majority in 1987.
Mr Lang was yesterday putting a brave face on the poll. He said his
canvassers had found the Conservative vote holding up well, with no sign of
being overtaken by the SNP.
Climbing through the ranks of government has left Mr Lang little time to
cultivate his vast constituency, which has few large centres of population.
'He doesn't seem to have done much for us - he's too busy down in
Westminster,' one voter said yesterday.
Farmers in particular, the backbone of the local economy, say they have
lacked a strong voice for their needs in negotiations over European
Community policy.
It may not be questions of policy which lie behind the upsurge in support
for the SNP - the issue has become Mr Lang himself.

FT  01 APR 92 / Election 1992: Scrapping to scrap the agreement - Breaking
Britain's accord with the Irish Republic is a Unionist electoral goal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM COONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
On a clear day, Scotland can be seen from the coast of County Antrim in
Northern Ireland. Just 15 miles away across the Irish Sea, it is the closest
the British mainland comes to Ireland.
The most visually spectacular part of the province, where tourists visit the
Giant's Causeway, is the heartland of Paisleyite politics. The Reverend Ian
Paisley, a giant of a man himself, champions the cause of maintaining and
strengthening the increasingly tenuous union with Britain across that narrow
stretch of water.
The manifestos of Paisley's Democratic Unionist party and of the Ulster
Unionist party led by James Molyneaux, both set the scrapping of the 1985
Anglo-Irish Agreement as their main electoral goal.
The Unionists see the agreement as a betrayal of the union. Dublin must have
no role in Northern Ireland's affairs they say. They are campaigning for a
devolved regional assembly, but at the same time want stronger
constitutional links with Britain.
Proposals by the nationalist SDLP for Northern Ireland to become a region of
a federal Europe, and be considered with the republic for the purposes of EC
funding, would lead to eventual rule from Dublin, say the unionists.
Canvassing in pouring rain in his North Antrim constituency town of
Ballymena, Paisley flashed his characteristic broad grin at passing drivers
who tooted their horns and gave him the thumbs-up.
'We are not against being good neighbours with the Republic, but we are
against being taken over. As a region of Europe we would become an annexe to
Eire,' he said.
But can the Unionists hope to increase their share of the vote on such a
platform, with unemployment at 15 per cent in the province and terrorism
deterring inward investment?
Hostility to the Anglo-Irish agreement was the main feature of Unionist
manifestos in the 1987 election, when their total share of the vote fell by
2.3 percentage points to 54.8 per cent, and the UUP lost the border
constituency of South Down to the SDLP.
Demographic trends are working against the Unionists. In the four Belfast
constituencies, the number of registered voters has fallen by some 14,000 to
217,000, over the past 10 years. Most are middle and working-class
Protestants moving out to new housing estates in the suburbs.
As a UUP party official said: 'They are moving to constituencies where the
Unionist vote does not need strengthening.' He added that '51 per cent of
the children in the schools are now Catholic'.
The fact that, for the time being, the nationalist vote is split between the
SDLP and Sinn Fein, the political wing of the IRA, assures the Unionists of
holding on to Fermanagh and South Tyrone, Mid-Ulster and North Belfast. All
three could fall in a future election to a combined nationalist vote.
The SDLP last month rejected a move by Sinn Fein to agree a 'compromise
candidate' to challenge the UUP's Ken Maginnis in Fermanagh and South
Tyrone.
The UUP holds nine of the 17 Northern Ireland seats and the DUP three, all
with comfortable majorities. In North Down, the DUP is fielding a candidate
against Jim Kilfedder, the veteran independent Unionist - the Alliance party
and the Conservatives are also standing.
Traditionally, the UUP has been the party of Protestant gentlemen farmers
and middle class, while the DUP has attracted working class votes.
Differences between the UUP and DUP 'are now mostly over personalities and
style', according to Peter Robinson, the DUP deputy leader and the sitting
candidate for East Belfast.
The DUP and UUP are confronting each other only in three constituencies
where the total Unionist vote is so large that a split could not let in a
nationalist. Robinson said these contests were in preparation for elections
to a devolved assembly, which both parties expect to take place next year.
'People will vote for who is seen to be the better Unionist,' he said.
The issue of Europe reveals deeper differences. The DUP is implacably
opposed to the Maastricht treaty and moves towards regionalisation and a
federal Europe. The UUP is more circumspect. It has a European office at its
headquarters in Belfast and its manifesto states 'it is prudent to
contribute in a positive sense to the various internal debates within the
community institutions'.
The DUP says it is the only Northern Ireland party that opposes the Delors
proposals on European political union and is not part of any political
grouping in the European parliament. Paisley says the UUP is allied with the
'mainly Roman Catholic' European Christian Democrat block.
Robinson's office is at the Dundonald Ice Bowl, a bowling and ice rink built
two years ago with 50 per cent funding from the European Community. The
shouts and screams of children playing filter up to his office. 'I am quite
happy to milk the cow before slitting its throat,' he said.
In the event of a hung parliament, both the DUP and UUP say that with the 12
combined seats they can hope to retain, they will not enter into a
coalition, but will vote as a block supporting the incoming government for
as long as this serves unionist goals. In spite of Labour's manifesto
commitment to a united Ireland, both say the Conservatives 'have done more
damage' to the union, than has Labour when in government.
A hung parliament is possibly the Unionists' last hope to reverse the
Anglo-Irish agreement, and place a bulwark against the 'Europeanisation' of
Northern Ireland.
For the Unionists, taxes, government spending and investment are secondary
issues in this campaign. Like the rain which frequently blots out that view
to Scotland, such considerations obscure the 'real' issue of Ulster's link
to Britain. They confidently expect the voters will prove their point.

FT  01 APR 92 / Election 1992: Sell-off threat to Labour's plans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, and IVO DAWNAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A FALL IN privatisation receipts in the financial year starting in April
1993 could pose a threat to Labour's spending plans.
Although Mr Neil Kinnock, the Labour leader, said on Monday that Labour
would be 'on a par' with the Tories as regards income from privatisation, he
said a Labour government would not add to projects in the pipeline. This
suggests that Mr John Smith, if he becomes chancellor, could face a Pounds
9.5bn shortfall in revenues in 1993-94 and 1994-95.
Yesterday, Mr Kinnock again shrugged off these concerns, describing them as
'crystal-ball gazing'. But his close aides were careful to add that a great
deal will depend on how quickly Labour can re-establish growth.
Questioned on the Coopers &amp; Lybrand Deloitte figures on future public
spending options, Mr Kinnock said the accountancy firm had made the
'elementary error' of failing to account for Labour's willingness to
continue with privatisations already begun.
He would not make commitments beyond the coming financial year, but did
concede that if the Red Book forecasts were proved incorrect it was
'conceivable' that Labour's programme would have to be reassessed in office.
The Treasury Red Book envisaged privatisation proceeds of Pounds 8bn in the
financial year starting today and Pounds 5.5bn in each of the two subsequent
financial years.
Whichever party is in power after the election is assured of privatisation
proceeds of more than Pounds 6bn in 1992-93. But income of only Pounds 1bn
is assured for 1993-94, while in 1994-95 the level of receipts assured at
this stage falls to about Pounds 500m.
Nearly Pounds 5.9bn of this year's privatisation receipts will come from
second and third instalments of past share issues. The second instalment
from the sale of the Scottish electricity companies should yield Pounds 835m
in May, to be followed by Pounds 1,915m from the second instalment of the
second BT sale in July, and Pounds 1,465m from the third payment due from
the sale of the regional electricity companies in September. A third
instalment from the BT sale is due next March and should yield Pounds
1,675m.
A further inflow of Pounds 350m in 1992-93 is expected from repayment of
debt and other small items. In addition, the government has announced plans
to privatise Northern Ireland Electricity for about Pounds 350m.
The Red Book projected a rise in the government's public sector borrowing
requirement to Pounds 28bn in 1992-93 and Pounds 32bn in 1993-94, and
subsequent declines in borrowing to Pounds 25bn in 1994-95 and Pounds 19bn
in 1995-96.
However, these projections take into account the Pounds 19bn of
privatisation proceeds expected in the current and two following financial
years. Without this income borrowing totals could be Pounds 37.5bn in
1993-94 and Pounds 30.5bn in 1994-95.

FT  01 APR 92 / Election 1992: Brown steps up attack over company failures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LABOUR yesterday stepped up its attack on the government's economic record
in London and the south-east, claiming that for the first time in years more
companies were going under than were being formed.
Mr Gordon Brown, shadow trade and industry secretary, announced figures
which he said showed that company deregistrations in Britain were running at
a faster rate than last year. He said the figures undermined the
government's contention that more companies were being formed than were
going out of business.
As the fight for crucial marginal seats in the capital heated up, the
Conservatives kept up the offensive over Labour's tax plans, saying they
would hit Londoners hardest.
Labour's policies on high salaries, combined with big mortgages in the
capital, would leave Londoners worse off than people elsewhere in the
country, Mr Michael Heseltine, environment secretary, said.
The figures revealed by Mr Brown showed that more than 20,000 companies had
deregistered in the first two months of this year, compared with 105,000 in
the whole of 1990 and 110,000 last year.
No month-by-month breakdown was provided for the preceding years but Mr
Brown said the figures - which he said came from Companies House  -
suggested 'an annual rate of at least 120,000'. This made 'the scale of
company failures even greater than the figures so far published'.
Mr Bryan Gould, shadow environment secretary, described London and the
south-east as 'the region of the country where this is happening at the
greatest rate'.
Conservative Central Office said the latest deregistration figures should be
seen in the context of the 'huge numbers' of businesses created in the last
13 years.
Labour also set out an agenda for tackling the capital's recession,
incorporating a London Development Agency, a technology trust and a regional
exports service.
Mr Brown said this would be targeted particularly at small businesses. The
party would bring together the national export services offered by the
Foreign Office, the Overseas Trade Board and the Department of Trade and
Industry.

FT  01 APR 92 / Election 1992: PM denies rift with Lamont over finance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS and PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN MAJOR, the prime minister, and Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor,
yesterday insisted that a re-elected Conservative government could combine
the return to a balanced budget with modest year-on-year reductions in
taxation.
As the state of the country's public finances remained at the centre of the
election debate, the prime minister rejected suggestions that he was at odds
with his chancellor over the outlook. Mr Major insisted that Mr Lamont's
warning earlier this week about the very limited scope for either tax
reductions or public spending increases had been directed at Labour's
spending plans.
Mr Lamont said on the BBC's Election Call programme yesterday that the
government could extend the new 20p rate to more taxpayers during the next
parliament by making small adjustments to the rate band that would be less
expensive than the Pounds 2.3bn it would cost to cut the 25p basic income
tax rate by one 1p.
Although he repeated his view that the government's financial room for
manoeuvre was limited, he said that there was some room in the government's
plans published at the time of the Budget for a modest cut in the basic rate
of tax later in the 1990s. However there was not sufficient scope for
Labour's spending programme, which he had costed at Pounds 38bn.
Mr Major dismissed the gloomy report by the accountants Coopers &amp; Lybrand
Deloitte, prepared for The Independent newspaper. He said a resumption of
growth in the economy would take the public sector back to 'broad balance'
by the end of the next parliament.
The suggestion in the report that a Conservative government might be obliged
to raise income tax in order to balance the budget rested on economic
assumptions not accepted by the government.
Mr Lamont reaffirmed his commitment to balancing the budget over the
business cycle and was optimistic Britain would return to the growth rates
of the 1980s.
He admitted that the UK's national debt would increase slightly in the next
few years but insisted Britain had a very low ratio of debt to gross
domestic product compared with other EC states. He was 'very determined' to
achieve a balanced budget and would maintain tight control over public
spending.
He also forecast that unemployment would fall and that the economy would
once again grow as fast as it did in the 1980s.
Speaking on Channel 4 News last night, Mr Lamont pledged that there would be
no tax increases - either direct or indirect  - within two years of a
Conservative government returning to power. He said: 'We will not have to
increase taxes. I cannot see any circumstances in which that would be
necessary. I believe our borrowing will fall as the economy recovers.'

FT  01 APR 92 / Election 1992: Major climbs on Falklands soapbox
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN MAJOR yesterday brought the 'Falklands factor' into his election
campaign, seizing on reports that Mr Neil Kinnock might be prepared to begin
negotiations about the islands' future. Tomorrow it is 10 years since the
Argentines invaded the Falklands.
In Chester, standing on his now-indispensable soapbox, Mr Major said: 'What
do we hear from the Labour leader as we come up to the anniversary of the
Falklands war? He wants to enter into discussions about what the future of
the Falklands should be.
'I wonder what message that gives to the soldiers, airmen and navymen who
actually fought in that war and to the people still living there.'
Mr Kinnock had indicated Labour might be ready to negotiate with a stable
Argentine democracy about the Falklands, provided that there were
enforceable guarantees about the islands' security.
He said: 'There cannot be anything done without the active consent of the
people of the Falkland Islands. Too much has been expended, the loyalty is
too great and the status is too important for there to be any abandonment of
the needs and desires of the people of the Falklands.'
Mr Major also highlighted the contrast between his campaigning and the more
'closely minded' style of Mr Kinnock. He told a lone heckler in the crowd of
a few hundred: 'It's nice to see one member of the Labour party who doesn't
live in a field train, secreted from the rest of the world.
'Wherever I go between now and April 9 this soapbox is coming with me. There
is no way they are going to stop the Conservative message getting right out
on the streets.'

FT  01 APR 92 / Election 1992: Enigma behind Tories' variations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE IMAGES emblazoned on the walls behind Mr John Major and his colleagues
at Conservative central office yesterday morning were for once positive.
The blackened tax 'bombshell' at the heart of his party's onslaught on
Labour's economic strategy had been replaced by a soft-focus photograph of a
young schoolboy working happily in the classroom. On the opposite wall was a
poster illustrating the steep rise in home ownership delivered by three
successive Conservative governments.
Mr Major was joined by Mr Michael Heseltine and Mr Kenneth Clarke - two of
his campaign 'A' Team - to spell out the brighter future promised by a
fourth electoral triumph. The important subtext was that Labour would wreck
it.
It was the message that Mr Major has been trying to convey since his weekend
inquest into the faltering Conservative election effort. The aim was to
respond to the judgment of party canvassers that wavering voters need
positive encouragement to vote Conservative as well as further cause to shun
Mr Neil Kinnock.
A few hours later Mr Heseltine played a starkly different tune. The
television cameras were invited to the marginal London constituency of
Dulwich to hear the environment secretary deliver the bluntest attack of the
campaign so far on Mr Kinnock's leadership.
The headline on his press release - 'It's the biggest load of Kinnocks I
have ever heard' - reflected the tone of a vituperative attack on Mr
Kinnock.
The sudden lurch from the positive to the negative came as no surprise to
those following the Conservative election effort. Nor did it inspire
confidence that the party has mapped out a plan for the final phases which
will succeed in revitalising a hitherto lack-lustre campaign.
So far the strategy pursued by Central Office has projected confusion rather
than clarity. It has left the impression that a carefully pre-drafted
blueprint has been cast aside in favour of violent tactical swerves.
Labour entered the fray with a single theme - time for change  - and has
pressed it since with the relentless professionalism which comes from 13
years in opposition.
The Conservatives started with several tunes but have seemed unsure from day
to day which to emphasise, which to discard. Senior ministers talk one day
of the need for more 'positive' campaigning, the next of how the party needs
to take a more aggressive line in attacking Mr Kinnock.
The caring Conservatism for the 1990s at the heart of Mr Major's election
manifesto was relegated to the background within days of the election
announcement. Initial embarrassment about the party's past quickly gave way
to a campaigning style of which Mrs Margaret Thatcher fully approved. Mr
Major - the prime minister who had planned to stand aloof from the fray to
capitalise on his popularity - began sprinkling his speeches with
bloodcurdling attacks.
By last weekend that was all judged too negative - until, that is, Mr
Heseltine's latest speech signalled that the campaign had run full circle
into a new round of attacks on Mr Kinnock.
Those running the campaign have answers for the critics. Winning an election
in the midst of recession was never going to be easy. Nor could the
image-makers have been expected to forge a seamless link between 11 1/2
years of Thatcherism and 16 months of Majorism. The Conservatives cannot
erase so recent a past. Mr Major is inexperienced and Mr Chris Patten has to
run both the general election and his own campaign in Bath.
The strategists argue also that day-to-day tactical adjustments have not
shifted the party from the ground on which it decided from the outset it
would fight the election - taxation, economic competence and leadership.
Whatever other issues have grabbed the headlines since the campaign started,
it has returned repeatedly to tax. Nearly two-thirds of the voters have been
persuaded that Labour would take more from their wage-packets.
The evidence of 1983 and 1987 confirms that in the privacy of the polling
booth, tax ranks much higher in most voters' minds than they are prepared to
admit to the opinion pollsters.
The Conservatives insist that this and the other familiar tunes on Mr
Kinnock and the economy will play well for them between now and April 9. But
with the opinion polls now moving decisively against them they can no longer
afford to sound like an orchestra without a conductor.

FT  01 APR 92 / Stepping away from Whitehall: A bold and widely-criticised
initiative to survive
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Transport Research Laboratory, the Planning Inspectorate and the Public
Records Office are among 15 bodies which are today launched as executive
agencies - free-standing organisations charged with delivering government
services.
They join 57 existing agencies which range from the Benefits Agency with
63,000 staff, responsible for paying social security benefits to more than
12m people, to the Wilton Park conference centre whose 30 employees organise
high-level conferences for diplomats at Wiston House in West Sussex.
At the same time, the Inland Revenue is reorganising its 62,000 staff into
34 'executive offices', each headed by a controller with considerable
autonomy, with the aim of improving services to taxpayers. A similar
reorganisation last year divided the 26,800-strong Customs and Excise into
30 'executive units'.
With today's new recruits, about 290,000 civil servants will be employed in
executive agencies or their equivalents - more than half the Civil Service.
A further 27 agencies, employing more than 66,000 civil servants, are on the
launch pad, including the Prison Service and the Ministry of Defence Police.
Described by the prime minister as 'nothing less than a revolution in
management in the Civil Service', the creation of agencies was recommended
in 1988 by the government's efficiency adviser at the time, Sir Robin Ibbs.
He said in his Next Steps report that the work of government departments
should be focused much more on the job to be done if services were to be
effectively delivered. He recommended that responsibility for specific
government activities should be devolved to arms-length organisations headed
by a chief executive responsible to a minister, but with considerable
freedom of operation to achieve performance targets.
Mrs Thatcher enthusiastically endorsed the Next Steps approach, and
appointed as project manager the ebullient Sir Peter Kemp, a career civil
servant with permanent-secretary status. The first agency - the Vehicle
Inspectorate - was launched in August 1988 and a model rapidly evolved which
could be applied to a wide variety of activities:
Each agency is governed by a framework agreement, which spells out
managerial responsibilities and sets targets for greater efficiency and
improvements in customer service.
A chief executive is appointed by open competition to be accountable for the
agency to ministers and to parliament - more than a third have come from the
private sector.
Customers are offered new and improved services, ranging from better
complaints procedures to new products, more convenient opening hours and
'value-added services,' which provide extras to those prepared to pay for
them.
The agency approach has gathered support from across the political spectrum,
with the influential Treasury and Civil Service select committee providing
all-party endorsement of Next Steps. And the effect has been considerable in
some parts of Whitehall: the department of social security, for example, has
hived off most of its functions to three agencies, leaving just 1,200 of the
76,000 staff in the policy-making rump department.
There have also been some notable improvements in efficiency. Companies
House has increased productivity by 17 per cent in two years, cutting from
25 days to seven the time taken to record new companies. The Passport Agency
has reduced the average time to process correct applications from three and
a half weeks to seven days. The Vehicle Inspectorate achieved efficiency
savings of 8.8 per cent over two years, against the government's target of
3.7 per cent.
Suspicion that agencies were a stage towards privatisation surfaced on the
Labour benches. In May, however, Mr John Smith, the shadow chancellor,
committed Labour to keeping the approach. He said there was no merit in a
policy which would 'uproot all the plants in the garden, rearrange their
roots and then, having planted them, expect them to grow well'.
Nevertheless there has been growing criticism of some aspects of the Next
Steps initiative. The Commons Treasury committee, for example, has attacked
the lack of an overall strategy for the reforms. Its seventh report on Next
Steps published last July said that 'it would not be satisfactory if a major
change in the structure of the Civil Service were to be introduced
piecemeal, without proper opportunity for full public discussion'.
A report in May by Sir Angus Fraser, the government's current efficiency
adviser, criticised government departments for interfering excessively in
their agencies. It recommended greater freedom for agency chiefs and cuts of
at least 25 per cent in the Whitehall staff overseeing them.
The limited scope for agencies to improve business performance has been
highlighted by the National Audit Office, the government expenditure
watchdog. In a report on the Vehicle Inspectorate, the office found that
after significant efficiency savings in the early years, further
improvements were constrained by government policy. Legislation forbade the
inspectorate to close under-used testing stations, and Treasury rules
limited the agency's freedom to compete with the private sector for
additional work.
Agency chiefs are also increasingly critical of Treasury reluctance to
loosen its grip over pay and grading - many are keen to introduce structures
more appropriate to their agencies' needs.
However, the experience of Her Majesty's Stationery Office, the first agency
to break away from national pay scales, is not encouraging. Some HMSO staff
are taking industrial action over this year's pay award, which was lower
than that offered to the rest of the Civil Service.
Supporters of agencies are not abashed by such setbacks. They point out that
it is the creation of agencies which has brought such issues of efficiency
and management effectiveness to the fore. And they are confident that with
both government and Opposition committed to the Next Steps approach,
agencies are here to stay.

FT  01 APR 92 / Lloyd's 1989 losses may reach Pounds 1.65bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LOSSES at the Lloyd's of London insurance market for 1989 could reach almost
Pounds 1.65bn according to figures circulated yesterday by the Association
of Lloyd's Members. The association represents more than 9,000 Names, the
individuals whose assets back underwriting at Lloyd's.
Financial Intelligence &amp; Research, a consultant to the association, has
offered best and worst-case scenarios for 1989 results based on provisional
estimates supplied by Lloyd's agents. The best-case scenario would be a loss
of Pounds 1.06bn.
But the association warned in a newsletter that the figures may not include
estimates for asbestosis and pollution reserves. Other factors including US
tax charges may make a significant difference to the 1989 result, which
Lloyd's will report in June.
Meanwhile, Names on Gooda Walker syndicates, which face losses of more than
Pounds 200m for 1989, have warned of new legal action if negotiations
designed to prevent payment of cash calls are unsuccessful.
Mr Alfred Doll-Steinberg, chairman of the Gooda Walker Action Group, said
his committee had been involved in 'intense discussion' over the past 10
days with GW Run Off, which has managed the Gooda Walker syndicates since
the agency went into liquidation last year. He said GW Run Off had also been
in contact with Lloyd's over the same issue.
The Names will seek injunctions to prevent Lloyd's drawing down deposits
held with their agents, irrespective of the result of a separate legal
action by more than 820 Names which was postponed yesterday until Monday in
the Commercial Court. Insurance companies are to be offered rent reductions
to continue support for the London Underwriting Centre, an insurance company
exchange. Its opening was delayed by a fire last August.
Market Building, a joint venture backed by 24 leading European and US
insurers, hopes that the exchange can eventually rival Lloyd's in size and
sophistication.
But August's fire was a big setback to Market Building, which owns a 25-year
lease on the property at Minster Court in the City of London. Damage of
Pounds 125m was insured, but the fire has delayed opening of the centre
until October next year and has freed more than 70 would-be tenants from
their earlier commitments.

FT  01 APR 92 / British Gas set for clash over pricing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH GAS is heading for a row with its regulator over its plan to raise
the price it charges rivals to transport gas through its pipeline.
The rises are shown in a document published by the company today which
suggests changes that would simplify its pricing structure for gas
transportation. British Gas is inviting comment before issuing a price list
in August.
But Sir James McKinnon, director-general of Ofgas, the industry regulator,
said yesterday: 'The pipeline business is a low or no-risk business and
there is no reason for its rate of return to be higher than the current
level, and maybe that's even too high.'
British Gas is currently allowed by the regulator to make a 4.5 per cent
return on its gas transport business.
Prices for transporting gas are likely to rise even if British Gas is
prevented from raising its rate of return on the business. That is because
British Gas has previously not tried to make a 4.5 per cent return across
all of its price bands.
The new British Gas structure would simplify pricing by evening out the
differences in prices charged across the country and unifying them in a
price schedule.
Under the present system, shippers must ask for an individual quotation for
delivering gas to one particular site.
The proposals for a new pricing structure are in response to demands by the
Office of Fair Trading that British Gas hive off its transportation unit
into a separate subsidiary.

FT  01 APR 92 / Managing director of Porsche GB quits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR PETER BULBECK, manag-ing director for the past eight years of the UK
subsidiary of Porsche, the German carmaker, has left the company.
Reading-based Porsche Cars Great Britain, whose sales have more than halved
from their 1980s peak, confirmed that Mr Bulbeck has been succeeded by Mr
Kevin Gaskell, 33, a former general manager for sales and marketing, who
joined in 1987.
Mr Bulbeck's resignation became effective yesterday after he requested early
retirement. He made the request at a board meeting of the Stuttgart
carmaker's UK subsidiary on March 20, to take early retirement. The company
rejected any connection between Mr Bulbeck's departure and other changes.
Porsche has struggled for sales in the face of the recession and Japanese
competition. The departure of Mr Bulbeck, a 30-year veteran of Porsche in
the UK, swiftly follows the resignation of Mr Brian Bowler as chief
executive of Porsche Cars North America. US sales have been the worst
affected of Porsche's operations. It sold fewer than 5,000 cars there last
year, against a mid-1980s peak of more than 30,000.
In February Mr Arno Bohn, chief executive of Porsche in Germany, threatened
to resign after the company initially failed to renew his contract. He
agreed to stay after winning a three-year renewal. Porsche was meanwhile
disclosing profits down to DM2m from DM65m in its year to last July.
Dr Armin Muller, company secretary and general manager, joins the UK
company's board as finance director.
Porsche Cars GB, which has shed about 50 jobs at Reading during the past 18
months, has announced price cuts of up to Pounds 7,000. Last year total
sales fell by 42.5 per cent to 1,612 from 2,801 in 1990.

FT  01 APR 92 / Pilkington claims lead in cheaper method: Glassmaking
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY, Northern Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PILKINGTON, the glassmaker, said yesterday it had developed a method of
turning raw materials into high-quality molten glass using electrically
fired furnaces, beating its three main international competitors - St Gobain
of France, Asahi of Japan and PPG of the US.
Electric melting furnaces are cheaper to install, easier to maintain and are
only half as polluting as gas or oil-fired alternatives.
Until now, however, the glass produced by this method has contained too many
microscopic bubbles to be used for anything other than bottles or jars.
Pilkington has developed a method of making the molten glass flow around the
furnace's electrodes so that the bubbles come out. This molten glass can
then be used to make optically perfect flat glass. The system is already
producing commercial quantities of glass from a small float glass plant in
St Helens, Merseyside. It now has to be scaled up for use on bigger lines.
At present, the method would only pay in the UK or Germany in small plants
because of the relatively high price of electricity. However, a hybrid
system of electrically boosted conventional melting furnaces offers a
medium-term solution for big plants where electricity is expensive.
In conventional gas or oil-fired furnaces, sheets of flame are played across
the raw materials, so the furnace has to have a roof lined with firebrick.
Heat is wasted and polluting emissions are produced by both the flames and
the process itself.
Electric melting is attractive as a production method because it can be
carried on from underneath the ingredients - sand, soda ash and limestone -
which melt down so that more can be piled on top. This insulates the molten
glass underneath and increases efficiency.
The electric method has still to establish a maintenance standard, but
Pilkington believes it could be as short as three weeks, against the present
13-week shutdown for conventional furnaces.
Sir Antony Pilkington, the company's chairman, said yesterday: 'Electric
melting has been an ambition pursued by all the major flat-glassmakers and
we are delighted we have been the first to demonstrate success. The process
offers the prospect of virtually pollution-free melting.'
Pilkington announced yesterday a rise in sales in the US of its glass for
car windows. This cuts down the amount of ultra-violet radiation and solar
heat reaching a car's interior. Pilkington forecasts an increase in sales of
the product in the US alone to Pounds 250m by 1995.

FT  01 APR 92 / O&amp;Y to seek Tube discussion
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS and ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OLYMPIA &amp; YORK, the property developer, expects to hold talks with the
government after the general election about financing the Pounds 1.3bn
Jubilee line Underground extension to London's Docklands.
The company yesterday failed to make its first contribution of Pounds 40m to
the project as originally scheduled. It is engaged in talks with its banks
about the restructuring of worldwide debt estimated at more than Dollars
20bn (Pounds 11.56bn).
Under an initial agreement reached with the government and London Regional
transport in November 1989, a further contribution from O&amp;Y was due by this
time next year, with the balance of Pounds 300m expected on completion of
the Tube extention in 1996.
Bankers say they are reluctant to put up the Pounds 400m originally promised
by O&amp;Y as its contribution to the Jubilee building costs.
But they fear that the value of Canary Wharf, Europe's biggest new
development of offices, to which they have lent Pounds 700m, will be
impaired if the extension is not built.
One possibility being mooted is that O&amp;Y and its banks would contribute some
funds to the line, although probably not the full Pounds 400m.
This would put the onus on the future UK government to decide by how much to
increase its own financing of the project. The Department of Tranpsort and
the Labour party are holding back from making any firm commitments to the
financial future of the extention while O&amp;Y fails to meet its own financial
commitments.
O&amp;Y's financial difficulties are being watched closely by several local and
international construction companies which have put in bids for contracts
worth up to Pounds 1.5bn linked to the building of the extention.

FT  01 APR 92 / Average family 'better off' than a year ago
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE AVERAGE family in Britain was better off in February this year than a
year before, Reward Group, the employment consultancy, says in a report
published today.
According to the latest twice yearly cost-of-living survey from Reward, the
income needed to maintain living standards fell by 4 per cent for the
average family over the 12 months - the biggest such fall since 1976.
However, only families buying homes with mortgages experienced the resulting
increase in their standard of living. A drop of nearly 18 per cent in
housing costs, reflecting falls in house prices, mortgage rates and the poll
tax, was chiefly responsible for the fall.
Poorer families living in council houses needed a 5.6 per cent increase in
income to maintain living standards, the report finds.
Reward says the Budget meant that a typical family living in a three-bedroom
semi-detached house would be better off. The plans of Mr Norman Lamont, the
chancellor, meant the income required to maintain their standard of living
would fall 1.7 per cent.

FT  01 APR 92 / Canadian will lead group bidding for Channel 5
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR MOSES ZNAIMER, the Canadian broadcaster who founded City TV in Toronto,
is to lead a bid for a Channel 5 licence in the UK.
He is to be chief executive of Five TV, which plans to bid for the licence
which is expected to be advertised soon.
Channel 5 should be able to reach three quarters of the UK audience by
conventional transmitters. The winner of the bidding process have to pay for
the transmitters and for the retuning of several million video recorders now
using the frequencies that Channel 5 will use.
If Five TV wins, Mr Znaimer, a former actor and merchant banker, will live
in the UK. Five TV is negotiating with potential backers including Time
Warner, the world's largest media company, Thames Television and Columbia of
the US.
The battle for Channel 5 looks like turning into a battle principally
between two powerful rivals with different concepts of broadcasting,
although there will be other bidders.
Five TV will seek to adapt the Toronto model of news, films and music to the
UK market. It will create a series of city stations beginning with London
and moving on quickly to Birmingham and Manchester. Each city will have two
to three hours a night of local news plus a national schedule which will
concentrate on music and films.
The other main bidder is Mr Silvio Berlusconi's Fininvest, which is likely
to concentrate on a national channel featuring glossy entertainment.
'What has to be decided is whether the UK has another generalised,
homogenised, bits-of-something channel or something new and innovative,' Mr
Znaimer said yesterday. 'I'm not selling tonnage (of audience); I'm selling
precision.'
He believes the UK regulator - the Independent Television Commission - has a
clear choice. He says its members can see Mr Berlusconi's channels in Milan
or a different model of television broadcasting on his own network in
Toronto.
He believes the UK is the best place to test his conviction that his 'new
model' of television can travel successfully outside Canada.

FT  01 APR 92 / Penalties on life policies may be limited
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LIFE assurance companies could face limits on the charges they pass on to
customers who terminate policies before maturity under measures proposed by
a consultant to Lautro, the industry's self-regulating body.
The proposals could require companies to make significant changes to the
system of paying sales agents. The current system allows commissions to be
paid 'up-front' as soon as the policy is signed.
The proposals could also address one of the most persistent consumer
complaints about the life assurance industry - the small percentage of
premiums which are refunded to those who cancel policies early.
Those who cancel within the first two years of the policy may lose up to 100
per cent of the premiums they have paid. A recent study by the Securities
and Investments Board found that between a quarter and a third of all
policies are cancelled within the first two years.
The proposals are contained in a paper written by Mr Marshall Field, a
consulting actuary for Bacon and Woodrow, who has been asked by Lautro to
review the industry's commissions structure. Lautro will decide later this
year whether new regulations on commissions are necessary.
Mr Field argues that the industry practice of charging all the sales
commission to the cancelling policyholder may be unfair and unwise.
He says companies would have more incentive to prevent the sale of policies
to those for whom they are inappropriate if they had to bear more of the
costs themselves.
The case against charging sales costs to those who end their policies early
becomes even greater in the case of those who were sold in appropriate
policies and are being charged for the mischance.
He proposes that sales costs be passed on in the product design. Thus, the
life fund might be charged with a fixed - and publicly disclosed - amount
each month to cover the sales costs for policies which last until maturity
and those which do not.
If more policyholders maintained their contracts until maturity, the life
fund would earn additional profits.
Windsor Life, the Telford-based life assurance company, said yesterday that
Lautro has lifted a 'voluntary suspension' of its sales force. The
suspension was imposed on March 19 following a revision of train-ing and
testing procedures.
The company also said that its chief executive, Mr Brian Wood, has resigned
and has been replaced by Mr William Yelverton, head of international
operations at New York Life, Windsor's parent company.

A GROWING proportion of manufacturing companies in the West Midlands have

The same is true for service companies on the domestic market, but the
proportion experiencing a rise in export orders fell in the first quarter of
this year after three successive quarterly increases.
The survey covered the performance of almost 450 companies, split nearly
evenly between the manufacturing and service sectors. Membership is strongly

Earlier this week NHS managers made an across-the-board offer of a 4.76 per
cent increase for most of the 115,000 hospital ancillary workers, rising to
6.86 per cent for the 13,000 worst-off workers. The offer, which is being

THE OUTGOING general secretary of the CPSA Civil Service union is urging
members to vote for a specific candidate in the election for his successor
as part of an attempt to stop a Militant sympathiser winning the job,
Michael Smith writes.
The advice by Mr John Ellis in the union's newspaper to vote for Mr Barry
Reamsbottom, who describes himself as a moderate, was attacked yesterday as
a misuse of power by one rival candidate and gross interference by another.
They are Mr John Macreadie, deputy general secretary and a Militant
supporter, and Mr Peter Thomason, assistant secretary and a candidate who
says he is a Kinnockite.
Mr Ellis, in his column in the monthly Red Tape newspaper, attacks the
Militant Tendency and advises the union's 124,000 members to vote for Mr
Reamsbottom.
Mr Macreadie was beaten by Mr Ellis for the top job five years ago after a
re-run election. He is demanding a right to reply to Mr Ellis's article.
Mr Ellis is to become general secretary of the Council of Civil Service
Unions.

FT  01 APR 92 / Trust hospitals report in-patient activity increase
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE, Social Affairs Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MORE THAN half the new self-governing trust hospitals increased in-patient
activity by at least 4 per cent last year, a survey by the NHS Trust
Federation showed yesterday.
Mr John Greetham, federation chairman, said the survey showed clearly that
trusts were contributing to improved patient care.
The government's health reforms and the first self-governing trusts, which
are run by their own boards outside health authority control, are a year old
today.
In-patient and day-case activity increased in all 36 trust hospitals which
responded to the survey. The increases for in-patient services varied
between 0.6 per cent and 24 per cent, with 56 per cent increasing activity
by more than 4 per cent. Day-case work increased by between 1 per cent and
45 per cent, with activity at 27 out of the 36 hospitals rising by more than
10 per cent.
The federation represents only self-governing trusts, so that its survey
does not provide comparative information on non-trust hospitals, many of
which have also increased activity. In 1990-91, in-patient throughout per
bed across the National Health Service as a whole increased by 6 per cent.
Mr Greetham said non-hospital trusts - community and ambulance services -
had also all reported increased activity.
Under the second phase of the health reforms a further 99 trusts and 280 GP
fundholding practices - where doctors have budgets from which they purchase
patients' hospital treatment - take effect today.
Mr Greetham said the development of trusts provided 'managerial freedom at
the local level to make the most effective use of available resources'.
Labour is committed to abolishing trusts and fundholding if is returned to
power. Hospitals and health authorities are, however, close to finalising
the contract negotiations for financing patient treatment in 1992-93. Even
with a change of government, managers expect that these contracts would form
the basis for operating the service in the coming financial year.

FT  01 APR 92 / Accountants protest at proposed standard
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PROPOSED accounting standard on the structure of financial statements is
not detailed enough, the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and
Wales warned yesterday.
The definition of 'extraordinary items' - the one-off profits or losses from
activities outside a company's normal business - should be tightened or the
concept banned, it argued in a submission to the Accounting Standards Board.
Its comments on the first financial-reporting exposure draft (FRED 1)
produced by the board also included a proposal that exceptional items should
be separately listed, not brought together under a single heading.
Standard-setters should also focus their approach more tightly and draw a
distinc-tion between listed and unlisted companies, the institute said.
Mr Paul Rutteman, chairman of the institute's financial reporting committee,
said: 'While we agree that standards should contain principles rather than
be a detailed rulebook, a standard should contain much more guidance than is
in FRED 1.'

FT  01 APR 92 / Cancer link to power lines 'inconclusive'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON, Science Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE EVIDENCE that electro-magnetic fields generated by electrical appliances
and overhead power lines can cause cancer is inconclusive, according to a
comprehensive review released yesterday by the National Radiological
Protection Board.
The NRPB is to sponsor more research into the health effects of non-ionising
radiation, to which everyone living in an industrialised country is exposed
through the use of electricity at home and at work.
The data available so far 'do not appear to provide the basis for
restricting human exposure to non-ionising electromagnetic radiation,' said
Mr Roger Clarke, NRPB director.
An NRPB committee chaired by Sir Richard Doll of the Imperial Cancer
Research Fund carried out the review. Mr Clarke called it 'the biggest study
published anywhere in the world on cancer and electromagnetic fields.'
The subject is controversial because some environmental groups, particularly
in the US, are convinced that electro-magnetic fields can damage health.
They have used the alleged cancer risk to campaign against overhead power
lines, and some cancer patients living close to power lines are now suing
electric utilities.
A report by the US Environmental Protection Agency in 1990 concluded that
there was a statistical link between exposure to electromagnetic radiation
and human cancer. But the agency's report was withdrawn before publication
because other federal bodies were not happy with it.
Sir Richard said in London yesterday that the agency's draft report 'was so
inadequate in so many ways that it could not be adopted'.
The NRPB report reviews more than 60 studies of occupational cancer in
electrical workers and eight studies of childhood cancer. Leukaemia and
brain cancer are the two diseases most likely to be associated with
electromagnetic fields.
'I am confident that there is no occupational hazard of leukaemia,' Sir
Richard said. There was more chance - though no clear evidence  - that a
small excess of brain cancer among electrical workers might be due to
electromagnetic radiation.
Professor Nicholas Grant of King's College, London, another member of the
NRPB committee, said the evidence for childhood cancer was 'weak'. He added
that exposure to electromagnetic fields at home might increase the cancer
risk by as much as 50 per cent to 100 per cent - equivalent to one extra
case per 1,500 children - or there might be no extra risk.
Additional research will be carried out in three areas: There will be a
large-scale study of childhood cancer, occupational studies, and laboratory
experiments with animals and cells to test the theory that electromagnetic
fields can promote tumours.

FT  01 APR 92 / Wind farm in Wales orders 103 turbines from Japan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE commercial exploitation of windpower in the UK took a leap forward
yesterday with the placing of an order for 103 turbines to power a wind farm
in mid-Wales. It will be the second wind farm in the UK and one of the
largest in Europe.
Mitsubishi Heavy Industries of Japan will supply the turbines for the wind
farm near Llandinam in Powys. The turbines each have an output of 300kw,
giving the installation a total power capacity of 31MW.
The wind farm is being built jointly by Tomen, a Japanese trading house,
EcoGen, a UK company formed in 1990 to bring together a number of interests
working on commercial wind power, and SeaWest, a US company and the world's
largest independent developer of wind farms.
The mid-Wales project is the first of several planned by the three
companies. The project could involve total spending of Y20bn (Pounds 86.6m)
over the next few years.
Mr Tim Kirby, chairman of EcoGen, said: 'We're delighted with the way wind
power has at last hit commercial viability in the UK. We have got a
fantastic resource here and we need clean power.'
EcoGen has been working on identifying a number of UK sites for wind farms.
The order for the turbines follows the winning of planning permission in
February.
Mr Kirby said a site on Anglesey had also come through planning and other
hurdles, and several more sites elsewhere in the UK were at an earlier stage
of development.
It was estimated at the British Wind Energy Conference last week that the UK
would have about 130MW of wind power by the end of next year. The Llandinam
project would represent a quarter of this.

Dyno Industrier, the diversified Norwegian group with main interests in
chemicals, said yesterday that its US unit Ireco was holding talks with
Imperial Chemical Industries' US unit, Atlas Powder, to establish a joint
venture to produce dynamite for the North American market, writes Karen
Fossli.
Dyno said that the aim of a new joint company was to take over, rationalise
and continue the dynamite production of the existing two companies. 'It is
expected that the parties will complete negotiations during the summer of
1992,' Dyno said.
The company explained that negotiations on the consolidation come as a
result of the continuing fall in demand for dynamite in North America.
Dyno said Ireco and Atlas Powder had combined annual dynamite production of
36,000 tonnes. Last year worldwide explosives sales accounted for 22 per
cent of Dyno's NKr3.5bn turnover.

Norway's Kvaerner group said yesterday that Kvaerner Masa-Yards, the
Helsinki shipyard it owns, was awarded a NKr2.2bn (Pounds 196m) contract to
build the fifth in a series of cruise ships for Miami-based Carnival Cruise

Two sister-ships to Imagination, Sensation and Fantasy, are due for delivery
from Masa-Yards respectively in 1993 and 1994. Kvaerner has two Finnish
shipyards, one in Aabo and the other in Helsinki, which combined employ
4,100 people.

Dollars 300m
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
The Export-Import Bank of Japan is to lend Algeria Dollars 300m (Pounds
173m), part of a co-financing with the World Bank which last June extended a
Dollars 350m financial sector adjustment loan to north Africa's largest
country, writes Francis Ghiles.
The loan, part of the Japanese government's fund recycling programme, is the
first untied loan of this nature to an African or Middle East country.
Algeria's foreign debt currently totals Dollars 23.4bn.
In a further gesture of support for Algeria's economic reforms, the Export
Import Bank is expected to extend two further loans soon.
The first, amounting to Dollars 100m, will be earmarked for the revamping of
a liquid petroleum plant belonging to the state oil and gas monopoly,
Sonatrach. The second, an Dollars 80m co-financing with the World Bank which
is expected to lend Dollars 200m, is for the extension of Sonatrach's
production capacity.
Japan's support for Algeria when debt repayments are severely constraining
the North African country's capacity to import vital spare parts and
semi-processed goods is also a recognition of Algeria's dogged perseverance
in refinancing its Dollars 23.4bn foreign debt rather than rescheduling it.

FT  01 APR 92 / US recovery is under way, indicators show
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A BATCH of positive economic indicators yesterday provided further evidence
that the US economy is recovering from recession.
The Conference Board, a New York business analysis group, said its index of
consumer confidence rose nearly seven points in March, to 54.0. This was the
first rise since last June and the biggest since the Gulf war ended last
spring.
Separately, the Commerce Department said the composite index of leading
indicators - the main gauge of turning points in the economy  - rose 0.8 per
cent in February, following a strong 1 per cent gain in January.
Regional indices of industrial conditions were also up. Chicago and Detroit
purchasing managers' indices both rose, indicating faster expansion in
manufacturing industry.
The figures were published as the Federal Reserve's policy-making open
market committee met to discuss the monetary outlook. The Fed is not
expected to sanction another cut in interest rates unless the incipient
recovery appears to flag.
Mr Michael Boskin, chief White House economist, said he expected the
economy's improvement to continue, but he stopped short of declaring the
recession over.
The reaction on financial markets was muted as many traders were hedging
their bets until the release on Friday of the March employment report. This
is seen as giving the best monthly snapshot of economic conditions.
Most forecasters believe a mild recovery is under way but confidence remains
fragile, partly because a similar recovery last spring ground to a halt in a
few months. Mr Bruce Steinberg, senior economist at Merrill Lynch, said slow
growth of employment would restrain the pace of recovery in coming months.
Mr Fabian Linden, for the Conference Board, said the level of consumer
confidence, while the best since last October, remained 'less than
reassuring'. The most encouraging sign was a sharp rise in the component of
the index measuring consumers' expectations. People were slightly more
optimistic about job prospects but the numbers planning to buy cars or homes
had fallen slightly.
Seven of 11 indicators contributed to the sharp increase in the index of
leading indicators. A longer work-week, followed by faster monetary growth
and a jump in building permits, provided the biggest boost.
An index of coincident indicators - which measures the current state of the
economy - rose 0.7 per cent in February after a 0.6 per cent decline in
January, another sign that the economy is turning around.

FT  01 APR 92 / Former BNL official says US and Italy knew of loans to Iraq
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Christopher Drogoul, the man at the centre of the scandal over more than
Dollars 4bn (Pounds 2.3bn) of improper Iraqi loans extended by the Atlanta,
Georgia, branch of Italy's Banca Nazionale del Lavoro (BNL), has broken his
silence and accused the US and Italian governments of knowing about the
loans.
Mr Drogoul is the former manager of the BNL Atlanta branch and his signature
appears on more than Dollars 2bn of medium-term loans and letters of credit
extended between 1987 and 1989.
Part of the loans helped President Saddam Hussein obtain militarily useful
technology from US and European companies that went into Iraq's nuclear,
chemical and ballistic missile projects, according to documents obtained by
the Financial Times.
Mr Drogoul was indicted last year on fraud and other charges related to the
loans, which were kept on a duplicate set of 'grey book' records outside the
normal BNL loan authorisation system.
Mr Drogoul, who has not given a press interview before, visited New York
last weekend and met Il Manifesto, a small Rome-based communist newspaper.
This morning's edition of the paper quotes the former BNL man as alleging
that the National Security Agency (NSA), the secretive US electronic
surveillance agency, intercepted the thousands of telexes between Baghdad
and BNL Atlanta and thus was aware of the loans.
Mr Drogoul also claims he kept two mid-level BNL executives in Rome informed
of his Iraqi dealings and says the bank knew 'in general terms' of the Iraqi
loans. US and Italian investigators have said in the past they believe BNL
Rome had knowledge of the transactions, a charge the bank has consistently
denied.
Mr Drogoul does not offer any evidence of direct US government knowledge of
the BNL Iraqi loans, but he traces the flow of loans from Atlanta back to
1983, when an initial US government-guaranteed Dollars 30m agricultural
credit was extended by BNL Atlanta.

FT  01 APR 92 / World Trade News: Hills 'still hopeful' over multilateral
steel accord
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   GENEVA, WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
IMPORT restraints protecting the domestic US steel industry for most of the
last decade expired yesterday with no new multilateral agreement in sight to
take their place.
Mrs Carla Hills, US trade representative, said she was still hopeful that a
Multilateral Steel Agreement would be agreed to eliminate 'trade-distorting
practices that have plagued this industry'.
The import curbs - restraints agreed by US trading partners in the guise of
'voluntary restraint arrangements' under threat of anti-dumping and
countervailing duty suits -were imposed in the EC in 1982 and the rest of
the major exporting nations in 1984.
They were renewed 2 1/2 years ago under pressure from the US steel industry,
which promised to give up its protection once an MSA was in place.
The Bush administration has said it would not again extend VRAs. However, it
is not discouraging governments offering to keep the curbs in place until an
agreement is reached.
Mr Rufus Yerxa, deputy US trade representative, said yesterday the US could
not accept an agreement 'that lacks meaningful disciplines over subsidy
practices and unduly restricts our ability to use domestic trade laws to
counter those practices.'
The EC and the other 24 countries involved in the talks fear that failure to
reach a deal will result in a rash of anti-dumping and anti-subsidy suits by
US steel producers seeking an alternative method of protecting the domestic
market.
Trade officials said negotiators would continue to meet bilaterally and
multilaterally to resolve outstanding issues, but no timetable had been set.
The MSA would have phased out tariffs on steel, eliminated non-tariff
barriers and outlawed direct state subsidies for steel production. However,
Washington wants to retain unfettered rights to pursue disputes through US
anti-dumping and countervailing duty actions.

FT  01 APR 92 / Collor in talks on new government
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   RIO DE JANEIRO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BRAZILIAN President Fernando Collor is expected to announce a government of
'national conciliation' following the resignation of his administration on
Monday.
The resignation of more than 30 ministers and federal secretaries was
apparently initiated by Mr Collor, disturbed by the avalanche of corruption
scandals involving senior government figures.
He spent yesterday morning meeting state governors from different political
parties, apparently to broaden his political base.
Several of those approached yesterday to assume office refused and so far Mr
Collor has announced only three new government members.
Mr Eliezer Batista , the well-respected international director of Companhia
Vale do Rio Doce, the state mining company, takes over as secretary for
strategic affairs head of domestic intelligence.
Mr Celio Borja, head of the Electoral Commission, is to become the new law
minister. Mr Helio Jaguaribe, a leading political scientist and critic of Mr
Collor from the Social Democratic party (PSDB), has been named secretary for
science and technology and will act as co-ordinator of social policy.
Eight ministers have been confirmed in their posts - those for economy,
education, health, labour and social action, and the three military
ministers. But there has been no word yet on three big ministries - foreign
affairs, agriculture and infrastructure  - or on 26 of the federal
secretaries.
Mr Cesar Maia, a congressman from the main opposition party, criticised the
move as 'a very dramatic way of getting rid of a few people'. He added: 'You
don't need to burn the house down to replace a sofa.'
But reaction in Brazil has been generally positive. The Rio and Sao Paulo
markets rose 7 per cent yesterday.
There was widespread relief too that the wave of corruption charges against
Mr Collor's government had not resulted in a military takeover, like that
recently attempted in Venezuela. That Mr Collor could deal with it in a
democratic manner has reinfirced political stability.

FT  01 APR 92 / Congress sings the incumbency blues: US legislators may face
growing difficulty in getting re-elected
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TWO YEARS ago, as now, incumbency was not the flavour of the month.
Congress, facing mid-term elections, was in bad odour because of assorted
savings-and-loan scandals, and the nasty smell of higher taxes was in the
air after a decade of fumigation from the Republican White House.
So what happened? No fewer than 96 per cent of all congressional incumbents
were returned to office, and the Democrats slightly strengthened their hold
on both houses. State governors did take a hit, with 14 out of 36 losing
their jobs and with some political heavyweights, both Democrat and
Republican, suffering narrow squeaks or bloody noses.
But, mostly, the status quo was maintained, in good measure because of
money. Only 23 challengers were able to raise half as much as their
incumbent opponents. Political action committees, the principal vehicles for
campaign finance, donated 19 times as much to incumbents as to challengers.
In all, of the 406 seeking re-election, 79 were unopposed and a further 168
were up against challengers able to raise less than Dollars 25,000, which
barely buys one television advertisement in a big market.
The anti-incumbency mood seems stronger this year, and the general
discontent with politics-as-usual in Washington reinforced by specific
factors. The House of Representatives' cheque-bouncing scandal has helped
drag Congress down to its lowest-ever level of public esteem. The movement
to limit the terms of elected officials has gathered some steam; voters in
the state of Washington last November rejected such an initiative, but this
has been offset by a recent Supreme Court ruling leaving intact a new
limitation law in California.
Also, the 1990 national census has meant the redrawing in the last two years
of many congressional districts to reflect shifts in the national
population. Finally, an unusual number of sitting congressmen, about 50 in
the House and six in the Senate, have announced retirement or have already
been defeated in primary elections.
Some, like Mr Warren Rudman, the Republican senator from New Hampshire, made
many an incumbent look over his or her shoulder, by issuing farewell blasts
against the political establishment's unwillingness and inability to face up
to real problems.
The only hard evidence of the strength of feeling against incumbents came on
March 17 in Illinois, the first primary combining both presidential and
congressional races. It saw several entrenched incumbents thrown out and
others winning only with greatly reduced majorities. Local and personal
circumstances were dominant in some cases, but not in all.
As a result, the forecasts for what might happen in Congress this year are
being reconsidered. The 435-seat House of Representatives - currently split
among 268 Democrats, 166 Republicans and one socialist independent - could
get as many as 100 new faces in November, approaching the post-war high of
118 in 1948.
There are 35 seats up in the Senate, where the Democrats hold a 57-43 edge,
20 defended by Democrats and only 15 by Republicans, and the proportional
turnover could be as great.
Naturally, as the minority party in Congress, the Republicans sense a rare
opportunity, especially if President George Bush's onslaught on Democratic
control of Congress takes hold. It was considered inconceivable that the
Democrats could lose control of the House, which they have run since 1954,
and it probably is still unlikely. But, assuming the Democrats lose some
seats, the House may acquire the sort of ideological majority that prevailed
in President Ronald Reagan's first term, with conservative southern
Democrats, probably the least vulnerable at the polls, often joining forces
with their Republican colleagues.
In the Senate, the additional Democratic vulnerability means that an
earthquake comparable to that which produced a Republican majority in 1980
for the first time in 26 years cannot be ruled out. As many as 13 Democratic
seats, several won in 1986 when control was wrested back, are reckoned to be
particularly shaky, compared to only seven for the Republicans, according to
a recent survey by the National Journal.
Part of the Republican optimism in the House stems from the fact it has done
better than expected in the state fights over redistricting. The general
population shift to the south and west, giving California, for example,
seven more House seats, favours the Republicans, but this might have been
negated by Democratic control over the majority of state governorships and
legislatures which redraw boundaries. That seems not to have happened.
Money continues to favour incumbents, but smart money always hedges its
bets. Moreover, Mr Jerry Brown has already demonstrated in the Democratic
presidential primaries that it is possible to make a political virtue out of
running on a shoe-string, with small contributions, and thus beholden to no
special interest group. Perhaps because of this, nearly twice as many
challengers have declared their intent this year as against this time in
1990.
These are, however, very early days. Most congressional primaries will not
take pace until the summer and autumn. Even then, it will be difficult to
differentiate between national sentiment and local circumstance. Equally,
the impact of the presidential race is unpredictable. Ronald Reagan's
coat-tails, long in 1980, had disappeared by 1984. Ticket-splitting had
become, in effect, the national norm, and, even if the plague on incumbency
becomes endemic, the end result may be similar.

EC and US negotiators began last-ditch talks on subsidies for civil aircraft
manufacturers yesterday, determined to resolve remaining differences.
'We really are going into this session here tonight with the purpose of
finishing this,' said a senior EC official before the meeting began. The
talks were expected to run late into the night and could continue today even
though the two sides' self-imposed deadline for a solution expired at
midnight.
This is the third time in a fortnight that Mr Hugo Paemen, EC senior trade
negotiator, and Mr Michael Moskow, US deputy trade representative, have met
for talks centred on the level of direct government subsidies for Airbus
Industrie, the EC manufacturing consortium, and indirect grants for US
manufacturers.
Both sides have commented on the positive atmosphere of last week's
Washington talks. The problem now is working out the exact levels of subsidy
each side will allow the other and concede on behalf of its own
manufacturers. Negotiators are thought to be talking about direct subsidy
levels of between 30 and 35 per cent, compared with the EC's original offer
to reduce the level to 45 per cent.
In return, the US would have to peg indirect support to perhaps as low as 5
per cent.

FT  01 APR 92 / UN votes for Libya sanctionsfrom April 15
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL LITTLEJOHNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE United Nations Security Council last night voted for a showdown with
Libya - deciding to impose sanctions from April 15 unless it hands over the
two alleged Lockerbie bombers.
Ten countries including Britain, the US, France and Russia backed the
punitive measures, but as many as five others, among them China and India,
abstained.
Libyan television said the decision was 'unjust and unfair'. Libya's
ambassador to the UN, Mr Ali Elhouderi, said earlier he feared the UN move
was paving the way for new air attacks on Libya as in 1986.
The sanctions will mean that all Libya's air links will be cut off, arms
sales to the Libyans will be banned and Libyan embassy staff around the
world will have to be cut. But the UN move will not mean an oil boycott or
block most other trade with Libya, although there will be a ban on shipment
of aircraft and parts to the Libyans.
This is only the fourth time that the Security Council has imposed
sanctions, the earlier cases being against Rhodesia, South Africa and, most
recently, Iraq.
The relatively large number of abstentions in the 15-member Security Council
reflected the view that western powers were in too much of a hurry and ought
to wait for an interim ruling by the International Court at The Hague. The
court is considering a complaint brought by Libya against the US and
Britain.
Apart from China and India, the other abstainers were Morocco, Zimbabwe and
Cape Verde.
India and Zimbabwe indicated most UN members, being Third World states, were
probably against the UN resolution. Zimbabwe's ambassador said any idea that
international law could be made by majority decision of the Security Council
could damage the UN.
Sir David Hannay, the UK delegate, stressed that if Libya handed over the
two for trial in the US or Britain, sanctions would be unnecessary.
Libya will still have until April 15 to hand over the two men, accused of
masterminding the bombing of the Pan Am jet that exploded over Lockerbie in
Scotland in December 1988 with the loss of 270 lives.
The UN is also demanding that Libya co-operate with an investigation into
the bombing of a French UTA jet over Niger in September 1989, in which 171
people were killed.
In a warning to the Libyans, Sir David Hannay said any restraint on foreign
nationals who wished to leave Libya would be regarded 'with the utmost
seriousness'. The Foreign Office in London, echoing reports from European
embassies in Tripoli, said several people had been refused exit visas in the
last 10 days.
But Mr Elhouderi denied Libya was holding foreigners against their will. 'It
is truly a baseless allegation,' he said.
Under last night's resolution, Tripoli is required to cease all terrorist
action and demonstrate its renunciation. Britain may therefore be able to
demand details of IRA agents suspected of having received training in Libya.
Tony Walker adds from Cairo: Traffic across Egypt's remote western border
with Libya is expected to increase after the imposition of the UN ban on
aviation links.
Shipping from Egyptian ports is also likely to benefit from the air embargo.
Others among Libya's neighbours who are also certain to experience a jump in
transit traffic include Tunisia, which shares a land border, and Malta.
Col Gadaffi's recent threat, in an interview with the French weekly Figaro
magazine, that he would refuse to do business with 'hostile' countries, such
as France, indicates Libya will endeavour to be more selective in its choice
of trading partners.

FT  01 APR 92 / Indian minister quits over Bofors letter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   NEW DELHI
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Madhavsinh Solanki resigned yesterday as India's foreign minister
following his admission that he delivered a mystery letter to his Swiss
counterpart last month on the Bofors case.
Mr Solanki's action has greatly embarrassed Mr P V Narasimha Rao's Congress
government which is being accused of going slow on the investigations into
the scandal over payoffs by Bofors, the Swedish armaments company.
The Bofors case, which rocked the government when the late Mr Rajiv Gandhi
was prime minister, was one of the principal reasons for the defeat of the
Congress party in the 1990 elections.
With Mr Solanki's resignation - the first since the latest Congress
government was formed eight months ago - the Bofors affair has been
successfully resurrected by the opposition which is determined to embarrass
the government further. A parliamentary debate is to be held today.
Mr Gandhi and others were alleged to be recipients of payoffs from Bofors
which was awarded a Dollars 1.4bn (Pounds 800m) contract in the early 1980s
for supply of howitzers to the Indian army. The charges have surfaced
repeatedly since then. Mr Gandhi was assassinated in April last year and the
truth about the payoffs has never been told.
Following a parliamentary storm over a newspaper report on Monday, Mr
Solanki admitted that he handed over a note to Mr Rene Felber, the Swiss
foreign minister, from a private lawyer on the status of pending Bofors
cases.
'I now regret that I handed over the note which has caused embarrassment to
me and avoidable misunderstanding,' he said.
Mr Solanki claims he did not know the contents of the note. The Indian
Express, which carried the report, said that the note contained a sentence
asking Switzerland not to take any action on the Bofors cases in the country
until a petition pending in Indian courts was disposed of.
The Indian Express also reported the note said the Indian government
believed there was no urgency in the case and that the matter could held in
suspension.
A parliamentary investigation in the mid-1980s absolved Mr Gandhi of charges
of corruption but the investigation was reopened by Mr V P Singh when he was
prime minister. Mr Singh ordered a fresh inquiry by the Central Bureau of
Investigation more than three years ago but this has not been completed yet.
Mr Rao's government has denied accusations of slowing down the
investigations.

FT  01 APR 92 / Japan's emergency economic package: Dearth of labour belies
talk of recession - Drinks on the company might have to go, but only 2% are
out of work
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

THESE ARE meant to be tough times in Tokyo. The government yesterday
released an emergency economic package, companies have called crisis
meetings, executives have taken salary cuts, and workers have received
solemn lectures on the need for increased diligence and discipline.
But in the streets of Akasaka, the business and nightlife district of Tokyo,
the restaurant windows carry hand-written pleas for part-time staff.
'The trend is very serious. We are very worried,' explained an accountant
for a Japanese life insurance company, his right hand wrapped around a
mizuwari, the standard issue whisky and water. Asked how the 'crisis' had
hurt his family, he instead lamented the decline of Japan as an economic
power, the laziness of young Japanese, and Japanese politicians' lack of
morality.
For the average Japanese, the economic 'crisis' is talked about on
television, but not seen on the streets. There are an average 1.25 jobs
available for each job-seeker, and unemployment fell by from 2.1 per cent to
2.0 per cent in February. Fast-food restaurants are starved of staff, while
owners of small factories are lobbying the government to allow more foreign
'trainees' to work their lathes and drive their trucks.
Land prices are reckoned to have fallen by 30 per cent over the past two
years, but there is no mortgage repayment crisis for middle class Japanese.
Some apartment developers are in pain, but first-time home buyers are still
daunted by the Y55m (Pounds 240,100) needed to buy a reasonable two-bedroom
apartment within 90 minutes of the central business district.
Household savings are 6.5 per cent higher than a year earlier at an average
Y11.28m, so there is money in the bank, though consumer electronics and car
makers are concerned by a new-found fondness for second-hand products. Used
car sales have risen as new car sales have fallen over the past year, and a
secondary market appears to be emerging for the video cassette recorders and
television sets traditionally tossed out on the regular 'big rubbish' night.
Japanese may not be living the 'crisis', but corporate Japan is certainly
worried about about it. Business magazines, always keen to spot trends, have
identified three cost-cutting Ks - kokoku, kosai and kokusai: advertising,
entertainment and international business.
The love of numbered lists has deep roots in Japan, and until now the most
recent talking point was a separate set of three Ks describing the type of
work avoided by picky, younger Japanese: kitanai, kiken and kitsui - dirty,
dangerous and difficult.
Advertising is down, with a survey by the Ministry of International Trade
and Industry (Miti) showing an 8.6 per cent decline on last year. Dentsu,
the largest agency, said the cutbacks correspond with industries' fortunes,
with slower demand from the finance, electronics and real estate sectors,
and stronger orders for personal items such as cosmetics and clothes.
At Daikyo, the leading builder of apartments in Tokyo and a prominent victim
of the property market slump, an internal review of costs has begun. But the
company's vice-president, Mr Katsuhiko Muramoto, said advertising 'remains
important for us', although the company is buying less space simply because
it is building fewer apartments.
'It is a tool for developing our business, but we have to use it in an
efficient manner,' Mr Muramoto said. 'We are reducing all kinds of waste. We
don't have a set plan to cut entertainment expenses by, say, 10 per cent,
but we are looking for ways to save money.'
Several groups have chosen to save money by cutting executives' salaries. At
Minolta, the camera company which will report its first loss in 27 years,
directors have taken a 10 per cent pay cut and executive directors 20 per
cent. The chairman and president of Matsushita Electric Industrial, the
electronics company, are taking a 50 per cent reduction for three months
from today.
Down in Akasaka, there is genuine concern about the fate of the furious,
company-subsidised drinking that lubricates the Japanese economy. A leading
business magazine asked whether the downturn will mark 'the end of
entertainment heaven' for executives and bar owners.
Most of the evidence is anecdotal but luxury club owners say their business
is down 20 per cent this year, and golf club membership dealers report a
sluggish secondary market.
However, the National Tax Agency reports that in the year to end January,
entertainment costs rose 13 per cent to a record Y5,620bn, just above the
Y5,610bn budgeted for education this year.
As for the third K, kokusai, or international expenses, financial
institutions have delayed opening new foreign branches, while Japanese
investment capital has come home after the massive outflows of the late
1980s. But companies are reluctant to admit to a lower international
profile, though it is generally agreed that corporate sponsorship of foreign
art galleries, car racing, and the like, is declining.
The common person's 'international' expense, tourism, is apparently
untouched by recession, as the number of travellers has climbed above the
record levels of pre-Gulf War days. And for those yet to book a holiday
during the Golden Week rush later this month, it's too late, the planes are
full.

INDIA'S export-import policy for the next five years, unveiled yesterday by
Mr P. Chidambaram, the minister of commerce, specifies that trade will be
free except for a few restricted items.
The government's annual budget presented in February initiated many trade
policy reforms, including partial convertibility of the rupee and reduction
in tariffs. The export-import policy announced yesterday substantially
eliminates licensing, quantitative restrictions and other regulatory and
discretionary controls.
Consumer goods imports will continue to be restricted, but import of capital
goods and raw materials has been liberalised. The government monopoly over
substantial imports has been reduced to eight items including crude oil,
fertilisers, cooking oil and cereals.

FT  01 APR 92 / Measures aim to restore confidence

<TEXT>
THE package of emergency measures announced yesterday by the Japanese
government cover a range of fiscal and regulatory areas aimed at boosting
the economy. The aim is not only to accelerate public works spending, but
also to stimulate spending by introducing special loan programmes and easing
regulations.
The Economic Planning Agency, which issued the programme, appeared
equivocal, however, about the actual state of the economy. It said
employment and spending were firm, and corporate profits remained high by
historical standards. None the less the economy was slowing and the agency
wanted to arrest any further deterioration in business and consumer
confidence. The package was thus aimed at boosting confidence over and above
stimulating the economy.
The measures are:
Central government will 'front load' its public works programme by spending
75 per cent of the annual budget in the first half of the year. Normally 68
per cent of the budget is spent in the first half.
Mr Masaru Yoshitomi, director general of the EPA co-ordination bureau, said
central government spending would rise by 15.7 per cent compared to fiscal
1991 during the first half of the year, an increase of Y1,500bn. Front
loading was responsible for two-thirds of this increase.
Local government, whose public works spending is about twice that of central
government, was expected to follow a similar programme, although the amount
could not yet be quantified. Electricity, gas and telecommunications would
increase budgets and bring forward spending schedules. In the electricity
industry, capital spending would be increased by Y300bn to Y4.3bn, with
Y1,000bn previously budgeted for the second half moved to the first. The
telephone companies would increase spending over budget by Y90bn to
Y1,290bn. A variety of lending programmes would be introduced to support
companies investing in labour-saving devices. Money would be lent at 5.9 per
cent, compared to current rates of 6.0 per cent to large companies, while
loan rates to small and medium companies would be cut from 5.1 per cent to
4.6 per cent.
Private spending would be supported by promoting shorter working hours,
including a five-day work week for civil service employees. Long distance
telephone rates are to be cut. Housing loan ceilings from the government
Housing Loan Corporation are to be raised and, in an effort to stimulate
demand for vehicles, the building of car parks is to be promoted.
In addition to lower loan rates for labour saving investment, a variety of
credit and insurance schemes are to be improved for small businesses.
Measures are to be taken to improve the operation of the stock and bond
markets.
The government is to pursue flexible implementation of monetary policy. This
is a thinly veiled hint that the Bank of Japan should cut interest rates.
Mr Yoshitomi was in no doubt about the importance of the programme. 'By
these measures we still expect we can achieve 3.5 per cent (economic
growth),' he said.
Mr Yoshitomi said that, compared to previous government emergency packages,
the government was catching the downturn in the economy before it became
serious. He therefore believed the measures would take rapid effect.
He said that while it would be impossible to quantify precisely the impact
of the measures, the process of corporate inventory adjustment was expected
to peak by September, and that economic recovery would begin afterwards.
A possible supplementary budget to make up for a dip in spending expected in
the second half of the fiscal year would be considered only after the
emergency measures had been given time to work.

FT  01 APR 92 / Markets greet Tokyo moves with scepticism
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN'S emergency economic package yesterday was greeted with scepticism by
the Tokyo financial community, which saw the government's announcement as
little more than a rehash of long-discussed reforms.
One proposal, to develop the domestic corporate bond market by eliminating
issuance limits and restructuring the underwriting procedures, alone
prompted hopes of changes towards a larger and more liquid market for
corporate paper.
Expectations of today's 0.75 percentage point cut in the official discount
rate also failed to stimulate yesterday's stock or bond markets, and the
knowledge that a bad financial year was over with a new year beginning today
brought no comfort.
Mr Craig Chudler, strategist at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, the Swiss-owned London
stockbroker, said the package did not contain any concrete proposals,
indicating a lack of commitment by the government.
The stock market has been haunted by fears that the Nikkei stock average
could fall by a further fifth to as low as 15,000 before a recovery, and
dealers generally believe that yesterday's government action did little to
ease those fears.
Apart from proposed rule changes which would eventually allow companies to
hold their own shares, listed groups are being encouraged to pay higher
dividends. For more than a year, the government and institutional investors
have urged Japanese companies to increase dividends, but there has been
little response, and individual investors remain wary of the scandal-tainted
stock market.
Trading volumes are weak, companies' unrealised profits on stock holdings
continue to be eroded, and new equity issues have dried up. In contrast,
Y9,000bn (Pounds 39.3bn) was raised in 1989 on the Tokyo stock market
through new issues and equity-linked instruments.
Another poorly received proposal was the establishment of equity investment
funds for institutional investors. Mr Kaoru Shimura, head of equity
investment at Sumitomo Life, a leading life assurer, said the most needed
change to revive investor confidence was a cut in taxes on investments.
The finance ministry said the proposals held out the prospect of accelerated
reforms in the corporate bond market. Japanese companies are in dire need of
alternative fund raising measures, as aside from the weak stock market bank
lending has become tighter due to banks' capital constraints.
Mr Robert Feldman, economist at Salomon Brothers, said the proposals had
significant importance in the longer term affecting the supply of money
available to companies.
Japanese companies need funds not least because they will be required to
make large repayments on equity-linked bonds issued in the late 1980s.
According to Daiwa Securities, Japanese banks will need to repay Y6,950bn on
maturing equity-linked bonds in the fiscal year ending March 1993.
The Japanese bond market has traditionally functioned to fund the
government, and the corporate bond market has been heavily regulated.
However, the companies' craving for funds has pushed corporate bond issues
for the fiscal year ended March to Y2,316.7bn, three times that of two years
ago.
The progressive dismantling of the barrier between the banking and
securities industries, already under way and due to be implemented next
year, is expected to increase competition in underwriting the bonds. Banks
may as a result enter a market currently dominated by the Big Four brokers -
Nomura, Daiwa, Nikko and Yamaichi Securities. The ministry also hopes to
abolish the commission-bank system, where every issue has a bank which acts
as an agent representing investors.
Strict limits on company bond issues are expected to be eased. Currently, a
company may only issue bonds equal to its equity capital plus retained
earnings. The ministry of finance wants to introduce new products, such as
bonds with shorter maturities and floating rate notes.

ITALY'S three largest union groups yesterday urged the government to stop
promising their members generous pensions, Reuter reports from Rome.
Paying out so much to an increasingly ageing population was like 'sitting on
a barrel of dynamite', they warned. Some 300,000 state workers are lining up
to take advantage of a law passed last year enabling them to give up their
ordinary state pensions and transfer to a lucrative system run by the
Treasury for civil servants.
The law threatens to cost the social security service more than L6,000
trillion (million million) (Pounds 2.79bn) a year. 'This is an absurd law
which needs immediate correction,' said the CGIL, the UIL and the CISL
umbrella union groups. 'It flies in the face of all attempts to reform the
pension system.' In theory, the law offers 'golden pensions' of 100 per cent
of retirement salary to all employees in the public sector.
Italian pensions, among the most generous in the world, have long been
identified as one of the causes of the massive budget deficit but
politicians have avoided cutting them for fear of losing votes.

THE European Court ruled yesterday that a Danish labour market tax on
employers was illegal, confirming an earlier recommendation by the advocate
general, writes Hilary Barnes in Copenhagen.
The tax was introduced in 1987 to replace an employer social security tax
levied on the total wage bill.
The government scrapped the employers' social security contribution and
introduced a tax levied on the company's total import bill and on value
added in production for the domestic market.
Exports were excluded from then tax.
Import companies brought the case against the government, claiming that the
tax was discriminatory and in conflict with the Treaty of Rome.
Many companies are planning to withhold payment for the fourth quarter of
last year, due on April 20, following the ruling.

MR Volker Ruhe, the new German defence minister, has long been seen as a
rising star of the new generation in Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian
Democratic Union (CDU).
He is a staunch Atlanticist and has a wide range of political friends and
contacts in London and Washington.
Mr Ruhe, 49 and a fluent English speaker, is the man most credited,
alongside Mr Wolfgang Schauble, the parliamentary leader of the party, with
giving a sharp edge to political campaigning.
That has helped revive CDU fortunes since last year, when the rising costs
of unification caused a slump in the polls.
Mr Ruhe has used the issue of asylum-seekers, a real public concern, to
outmanoeuvre political rivals.
As former chairman of the foreign affairs committee in the Bundestag, lower
house of the German parliament, he has made no secret of his ambition to
succeed Mr Hans-Dietrich Genscher as foreign minister.
In accepting the post of defence minister, he has been forced to settle for
less, although since he is a keen supporter of Nato, the appointment will
reassure the US that Germany is not drifting away from the alliance.

FT  01 APR 92 / Developer Speyhawk in deal on debts after Pounds 217m loss
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER, Property Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SPEYHAWK, the property developer, yesterday underlined the severity of the
UK's worst commercial property decline for more than 50 years by announcing
a Pounds 216.8m annual loss and the restructuring of more than Pounds 300m
in debts.
After announcements of refinancing talks by Olympia &amp; York and Heron
International, Speyhawk's plight provides a further illustration of a slump
which has wiped more than a quarter of the value off commercial property
since the market's peak in 1989.
Speyhawk, which has debts of Pounds 303m, is technically insolvent as its
liabilities exceed its assets by some Pounds 70m. However, its 46 banks, led
by Barclays and Citibank, have agreed to restructure its debts and provide
it with working capital over four years.
Speyhawk's shares fell from 11p to 2 1/2 p, even though City analysts had
long expected very heavy losses from the company, which had been talking to
its banks since last August.
Speyhawk has been particularly severely hit by the property crash since it
does not have rental income to cushion it from its interest costs. It relies
on selling the properties it builds but has been stymied by the shortage of
demand.
It has a high exposure to the City of London, which is the worst-hit market
in the country, as a result of over-building and the recession in financial
services. More than half of the Pounds 205m provisions Speyhawk made against
its properties are due to two City buildings, Cannon Bridge and Exchequer
Court. Development sites also suffered heavy write-downs to as little as 20
per cent of former values.
The problems of companies like Speyhawk stem from the coincidence of
recession and an unprecedented amount of new building. The surge resulted
from a relaxation of planning controls, demand for technically improved
buildings and a large increase in bank lending for commercial property,
which rose to a record Pounds 40bn last year. Mr Trevor Osborne, chairman of
Speyhawk and president of the British Property Federation, said the
experience had been 'chastening'. But he thought there would be no need for
further write-downs and the company's properties would increase in value
over the next four years.
Shareholders will receive information on a planned restructuring of share
capital when a final agreement is reached with the banks. 'Shareholders
should not expect to receive dividends for some time,' Mr Osborne said. The
company said it had 'drastically' reduced its overheads, by cutting its
staff from 350 people to 47 people. Turnover fell by 71 per cent from Pounds
262.6m to Pounds 76.4m in the year to September 30 1991. The loss per share
was 829.7p, after a loss of 27.8p last year.

FT  01 APR 92 / IMF reaches agreement on membership terms for Russia
</HEADLINE>

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
RUSSIA should be a fully fledged member of the International Monetary Fund
within about a month, following agreement yesterday morning by the fund's
executive directors on the terms of its accession.
These grant it a 3 per cent quota in the fund, enabling it to draw about
Dollars 4bn (Pounds 2.3bn) from IMF resources. It would rank as the
eighth-largest regular member nation, behind Italy and Canada and ahead of
the People's Republic of China.
The 3 per cent figure is a compromise between the 2.5 per cent share
originally proposed by the Group of Seven leading industrial countries and
the 4 per cent-plus stake sought by Russia.
In a statement, Mr Michel Camdessus, the IMF managing director, welcomed the
return of a former part of the Soviet Union to the international financial
community after a 45 year hiatus.
He commended Russia for launching 'a bold and comprehensive economic reform
programme', which, he said, 'represents a major step towards a market
economy and macroeconomic stabilisation'.
Mr Camdessus urged the Russian authorities to press ahead with economic
reform as rapidly as possible. Adherence to the new programme would increase
the understanding and support of other nations, as well as the IMF, he said.
The IMF's approval should be supplemented today when President George Bush
is due to outline what the US government is prepared to do to assist the
former Soviet republics. The president postponed a scheduled speaking
engagement on regulatory reform in order to fit in a policy statement.
Mr Bush is expected to endorse a US contribution to a rouble stabilisation
fund. Additional humanitarian assistance is also on the agenda. Much will
depend on the degree to which the president commits himself to lobbying for
his programme on Capitol Hill, where foreign aid in all its forms is not
currently popular.
According to IMF procedures, finance ministers from 150 countries will
receive, probably this week, a draft membership resolution, requiring a
response within 30 days. The necessary approval, IMF officials said, should
be obtained by the next meeting of the IMF's policymaking Interim Committee
on April 27.
Russia is the first of the former Soviet republics to be approved for
membership by the IMF's executive board. It follows close scrutiny by the
board on Monday of the economic programme presented by a Russian delegation.

FT  01 APR 92 / BR order may save 1,500 Brel jobs in York
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD and ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE government yesterday said British Rail had found the money to place a
Pounds 130m order which could save 1,500 jobs at Brel, Britain's biggest
railway carriage maker, in York, the most marginal Conservative seat.
Mr Roger Freeman, transport minister, has written to Mr Conal Gregory, the
Conservative candidate who won York in 1987 by only 147 votes, revealing
that BR planned shortly to place an order for 188 Networker coaches for
Network SouthEast.
The government had been under pressure from Mr John Prescott, Labour's
transport spokesman, who had urged Mr Malcolm Rifkind, transport secretary,
to allow BR to place an immediate order with Brel.
BR confirmed yesterday that it expected to place the order by mid-April,
although it may not necessarily go to Brel. The only other competitor is
Metro-Cammell, part of GEC Alsthom.
British Rail also announced that it and Brel had ended a long-running
dispute over the cost of modifications and repairs to the 447 Class 158
trains being built, mainly for regional services.
The settlement was announced as Asea Brown Boveri, Europe's largest
electrical engineering group, acquired Trafalgar House's 40 per cent stake
in Brel, to double its own shareholding to 80 per cent. The other 20 per
cent is owned by Brel's management and employees. British Rail sold Brel in
April 1989. Although the terms of the deal were not revealed, it is
understood that the Swedish-Swiss group, paid a nominal sum, believed to be
Pounds 1, for the stake. Trafalgar's loan stock in Brel, worth about Pounds
13m, is due to be repaid by Brel in 1994-95.
Trafalgar, the property and shipping conglomerate, recently reported a
Pounds 26.5m provision against its investment and had made no secret of its
unhappiness with its involvement in Brel.
Its investment has been written down to Pounds 1 because of Brel's mounting
losses and adverse publicity arising from defects in the Class 158 express
trains.
Brel's York works will complete its current contract for 200 Class 465
trains for Network SouthEast in a year's time and badly needs the follow on
order to remain viable.
ABB and Trafalgar House installed Mr Bo Sodersten, an experienced railway
executive, as Brel's new chief executive to replace Mr Peter Holdstock six
months ago. Since then, Brel has cut 1,000 jobs and substantially
reorganised its new construction division.
Mr Bill Beaman, secretary of the works committee at York, welcomed ABB's
purchase of Trafalgar's stake, while Mr Sodersten said the deal would
produce much greater synergies between Brel and ABB's transport division.
About 70 per cent of Brel's business is with BR and it has had very little
success at winning overseas orders in a market plagued by overcapacity.

FT  01 APR 92 / Labour claims breakthrough
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS and IVO DAWNAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR NEIL KINNOCK last night claimed a breakthrough in the general election
campaign after three opinion polls indicated that Labour would move into the
final week with a lead of between four and seven points over the
Conservatives.
The surveys, which shocked the Conservative campaign team, are the first to
suggest that one party has taken a decisive advantage. They show a slump in
support for the Conservatives after last week's row over the health service
and criticism of Mr John Major's 'negative' campaigning.
Mr Paddy Ashdown's Liberal Democrats, whose support has risen in recent
days, are shown as the main beneficiary. Labour support remains at just over
40 per cent but the Liberal Democrats have moved up from about 16 per cent
to just below 20 per cent. But if the poll results were replicated on April
9 Mr Kinnock would move into Downing Street with an overall majority.
Senior Conservatives responded by signalling that the party would redouble
its efforts to detach 'protest' voters from the Liberal Democrats and
intensify its attacks on Mr Kinnock's leadership. Some senior ministers
suggested a radical rethink might be needed.
The boost for Labour followed another day of angry exchanges over tax and
spending. Mr Major underlined again his commitment to tax cuts and Mr
Kinnock insisted he would not increase the bills of the vast majority of
taxpayers. They dismissed suggestions in an independent report that an
impending crisis in public finances would curb greatly their respective
ambitions.
The largest Labour lead came in a Mori poll for The Times today, which gave
it 42 per cent against the Tories' 35 per cent and the Liberal Democrats' 19
per cent. A Harris survey for ITN's News At Ten put Labour on 41 per cent,
the Conservatives on 35 per cent and the Liberal Democrats on 19 per cent.
An ICM poll for The Guardian had the parties at 41, 37 and 18 respectively.
The Mori poll emphasised that Labour has retained its strong lead on the
NHS, while the Harris survey suggested that more of the skilled working
classes - the so-called C2s - have switched their allegiance to Mr Kinnock.
A series of polls in marginal constituencies - including one suggesting that
Mr Chris Patten, the party chairman, would lose Bath - reinforced the gloomy
news for the Conservatives.
Mr Major refused to comment on the poll findings but senior ministers
admitted they had been taken by surprise by the scale of the apparent swing
against the Conservatives. Some predicted another agonising inquest into
their lacklustre campaign. There were suggestions that if the results were
confirmed in polls due today, the party could be forced into a complete
shake-up of its election strategy and team.
Mr Michael Heseltine gave a flavour of the expected onslaught on Mr Kinnock
in a scathing speech yesterday questioning the Labour leader's fitness for
office. Emphasising Mr Kinnock's policy reversals, the environment secretary
said a Tory defeat would lead to government by 'a great big load of
Kinnocks'.
Mr Patten signalled that greater efforts would be made to convince potential
supporters of Mr Ashdown that a vote for the third party would help Mr
Kinnock into Downing Street.
Mr Kinnock attributed the poll findings to the contrast between his
'positive' campaign and the 'desperately negative' approach of the Tories.
He said the polls were in line with constituency and regional surveys which
had shown his party doing well in key marginals: 'We will be making large
gains and forming the majority government.'
Labour signalled its intention to move the campaign on to what it regards as
strongest ground  - the welfare state  - with the launch yesterday of its
Pounds 600m package to improve education. Today there will be a return to
the offensive on health, with Mr Kinnock renewing the charge that the NHS is
being privatised.
The Conservatives will attempt to switch the focus to Mr Kinnock's record on
defence. That will follow the election broadcast last night which portrayed
the Labour leader as a man who, after 30 years' membership of the Campaign
for Nuclear Disarmament, could not be trusted to maintain the country's
nuclear defences. Mr Patten challenged Mr Kinnock to disclose how many
Labour candidates were in CND after releasing documents indicating that all
references to the organisation had been excised from Labour's official list
of candidates.

FT  01 APR 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Paris pins hopes on Beregovoy
for premier
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DOMESTIC matters continued to influence bourses yesterday, writes Our
Markets Staff.
PARIS continued its vigil for the resignation of Prime Minister Edith
Cresson, which was expected to be announced in the next 24 hours. Dealers
said the market would welcome the appointment of Mr Pierre Beregovoy, the
finance minister, as the new premier because of his efforts to increase
equity investment in France.
Mr Robert Lyon, the head of Caisse des Depots et Consignations, the French
state financial institution, is tipped as Mr Beregovoy's successor.
The CAC-40 index ended 1.32 lower at 1,942.43, off the day's high of
1,962.24 on selling linked to the expiry of options and futures.
Perrier accounted for FFr1.2bn of total turnover of FFr3.6bn, as holders
sold into the market for the second day. Perrier was steady at FFr1,700,
with 723,250 shares traded.
BSN jumped FFr17 to FFr1,126 as fund managers re-invested their Perrier
proceeds. BSN was also boosted by a buy note from James Capel, which
reportedly bought 50,000 shares of the total 116,370 traded.
Hachette fell another FFr8.30 or 5.2 per cent to FFr150 on fears of a heavy
rights issue to strengthen its balance sheet, following the La Cinq losses.
FRANKFURT was encouraged by firmer engineering orders in February and some
positive results from steel and engineering groups. The DAX rose 7.55 to
1,717.86 while the FAZ index, calculated at midsession, gained 4.01 to
699.86. Turnover rose to DM5.1bn from DM4.5bn.
Mannesmann, which forecast 1992 group sales of DM30bn, put on DM3.70 to
DM280.00. The engineering group also reported that sales in the first two
months had risen nearly 30 per cent. Hoesch weakened 70 pfg to DM255.80
after saying that group sales in the first two months were flat. Linde put
on DM11 to DM827 following Monday's news that group net profit had risen
nearly 19 per cent.
Volkswagen advanced another DM7.8 to DM363.8, while the rest of the car
sector was lacklustre.
MILAN saw active interest in the telecoms, while the broad market staged a
technical rebound. Dealers said the market had now discounted disastrous
results for the main parties in the general election this weekend. The Comit
index added 7.98 or 1.6 per cent to 502.47 in turnover estimated at L90bn
after Monday's L57bn.
Sip jumped L56 or 4 per cent to L1,456 in 8m shares, double Monday's level,
on reports of a big foreign buy order executed by a Milan broker which has
close ties with a leading London broker. The latter was said to have issued
a belatedly bullish note on Sip this week. Sip was also buoyed up by hopes
of a rise in the dividend following Monday's news of a 19.5 per cent
increase in 1991 profit.
Mediobanca rose L195 to L13,585, encouraged by news of a better gross profit
performance in the first eight months of fiscal 1992. There were reports,
confirmed after the close, that San Paolo would start trading tomorrow.
Yesterday the grey market price in London was L12,070-L12,130, below the
offer price of L12,200.
Parmalat, the dairy and food group, was steady at L10,050 after announcing
its 1991 results. There were concerns that the company would launch a
capital increase to reduce debt.
ZURICH continued to focus on chemicals. The SMI index fell 2 to 1,837.2 in
turnover of SFr250m after SFr300m.
Roche bearers lost SFr30 to SFr4,350 and its certificates fell SFr20 to
SFr3,070 ahead of its results later this week.
Ciba-Geigy bearers rose SFr50 to SFr3,490 and its registered shares were
SFr20 higher at SFr3,490. James Capel issued a buy note on the stock, based
on its above-average growth prospects over the next two years.
BRUSSELS was dominated by retailers. Delhaize gained BFr70 to BFr9,430 with
more than 21,500 shares traded while GIB fell BFr10 to BFr1,332. The Bel-20
Index was 5.13 higher at 1,193.01.
AMSTERDAM concentrated on individual stocks. The CBS Tendency Index closed
up 0.1 at 124.7 in turnover of Fl 444.6m.
Begemann rose Fl 6 to Fl 118 in anticipation of good results which are due
tomorrow. Aegon fell Fl 1.6 to Fl 128.5 after announcing a 10.5 per cent
rise in net operating profit.
Wessanen, which hopes to double turnover by the end of the decade, rose Fl
2.8 or 3 per cent to F 91.5.
MADRID saw a large put-through of 2m shares in Banco Santander which closed
down Pta25 at Pta4,570. Telefonica fell Pta10 at Pta1,140, a two-week low.
The general index fell 0.64 to 255.47.

FT  01 APR 92 / World Stock Markets: Beware of Finns bearing gains and a
market rise - The recovery in Helsinki has been more apparent than real
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM COCHRANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The recovery in the Helsinki stock market this year has been more apparent
than real. The gains took place after a long period of decline and, for
foreign investors, they were almost wiped out by the devaluation of the
markka last November.
According to the FT-Actuaries World Index series, Finnish equities have
risen by 7.3 per cent in local currency terms so far this year, compared
with gains of 1.7 per cent for the Nordic bloc, 3.5 per cent for Europe and
a 5.3 per cent drop in the World Index itself.
However, as the broker James Capel points out in a recent Nordic market
review, Finland was the worst performer in Europe for the third successive
year, in ever decreasing volume. In local currency terms the fall was 13.7
per cent; in dollar terms, and reflecting the 12.3 per cent markka
devaluation, it widened to 24.4 per cent. This trend has continued this
year, with the stock market slipping 0.17 per cent in dollar terms.
Meanwhile, Capel's analysts, Mr Peter Lawrence and Mr Christian Diebitsch,
have been questioning the quality of the local currency gain. 'Finland has
once again started the year with a dramatic rise - the triumph of hope over
experience,' they remark, 'for the fourth year running?'
They also say that the corporate results season has resulted in a quick cold
shower for Helsinki equities and although, in nearly every instance, the
results have been no worse than expected, the domestic Hex index has now
come back (to 826.67 yesterday) by 11.7 per cent since its peak of 935.9 on
February 24.
In February and again this month, companies have been showing the effects of
a severe domestic recession, the collapse of trade with the former Soviet
Union, and the markka devaluation.
Loan loss provisions, above all, pushed Kansallis-Osake-Pankki (KOP),
Finland's largest commercial bank, FM1.61bn (Dollars 35.8m) into the red
before tax; Mr Pertti Voutilainen, KOP's new chief executive, said loan
write-offs jumped by 144 per cent to FM1.343bn.
In insurance, Vakuutusosakeyhtio Sampo swung from a FM29m profit to a FM229m
loss before provisions and taxes, but said that its decision to run down its
reinsurance business would lay the ground for better results in 1992.
Similarly, Kymmene, in forestry, said the devaluation of the markka would
significantly improve its earnings in 1992; unfortunately, that improvement
will have to follow a plunge from a FM394m profit to a FM1.3bn loss after
financial items in 1991.
Capel's analysts say that final 1991 figures are expected to show net
attributable losses totalling FM13bn for all Finnish listed companies, with
the most sizeable losses from the forestry groups, hit by poor pricing,
currency losses and crippling interest charges.
'Our forecasts point to further losses for 1992,' says the Capel team,
'although these should be at a somewhat reduced level as the benefits of the
devaluation are felt, coupled with lower interest rates. We will have to
await 1993 before seeing positive earnings.'
Economic indicators, too, reflect last year's wounds, with GNP falling by 6
per cent in 1991, unemployment hovering around 10 per cent and three-month
money market rates still around 12 per cent against nearly 15 per cent last
autumn. The comparison of what money costs, with an annual inflation rate
down to only 2.6 per cent in February, is a measure of the credibility gap
that Finland, and its equity market, still has to face.
'Interest rates will come down eventually,' says Mr Lawrence, 'but it will
take time. The devaluation last November underlined the risk of investing in
Finnish short- term paper; and, meanwhile, the sheer cost of money is going
to delay Finland's economic recovery.'

FT  01 APR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Soviet collapse hinders metal
projects
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE COLLAPSE OF the former Soviet Union is having a widespread negative
impact on mining and metal projects. Outokumpu, the state-owned Finnish
group, said yesterday its Dollars 600m offer to renew the Pechenganikel
smelter, part of the Norilsk nickel combine in Russia, had lapsed.
Technical details had been agreed but Russia's take-over had delayed
financial arrangements. Norilsk had asked the Russian authorities to be
allowed to keep all its foreign currency earnings and to be able to export
its metal tariff-free for some time to pay for the smelter's refurbishment,
Outokumpu said.
Meanwhile, Ukrainian officials have indefinitely delayed a bauxite mining
joint venture in Jamaica. The Nikolaev alumina plant in the Ukraine and a US
company were to have refurbished the former Reynolds Metals mine in Lydford
for Dollars 50m. Mining should have started next year at an annual 1.5m,
rising to 2.5m tonnes.
Russia's gold industry suffered from obsolete equipment, shortages of spare
parts, energy and raw materials and loss of staff, said Mr Alexandre
Doumnov, formerly a director of the Soviet state bank. He said gold
production had stagnated for two years and was now likely to decline.

FT  01 APR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: EC moving to a decision on farm
reform package
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE EUROPEAN Community is set to decide next month whether it can agree on
the most radical overhaul of the Common Agricultural Policy in its 30-year
history.
At the same time, the Community roundly rejected yesterday's ruling by the
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade that the new EC oilseeds regime
discriminated against US soya imports, in a response likely to worsen
further the transatlantic conflict over farm trade.
The European Commission and the current Portuguese presidency of the EC are
to push for the conclusion of the 14-month negotiations on CAP reform at the
next Council of the 12 farm ministers in Luxembourg on April 28.
This followed individual negotiations with each of the ministers late into
Monday night. All objections of principle to the Brussels reform blueprint
appear to have been set aside, according to Commission officials and senior
officials from member states. They stressed, nevertheless, that critical
details remained to be tied up in horse-trading that could easily last into
June.
'There was a lot of sweetness and light,' a senior Commission official
remarked without a hint of irony. But he cautioned that the farm council had
accepted the reform in principle in November, only to have the UK,
Netherlands and Denmark restate fundamental objections earlier this month.
The Dutch and Danes now appear willing to negotiate the best outcome for
their interests on the details of the reform, their officials say. The
British, de facto, are doing the same, even though Mr John Gummer, UK farm
minister, insisted yesterday that agreement would not be possible if
Britain's bigger farms were discriminated against.
The reform, in essence, calls for heavy price cuts, with full compensation
which medium-to-large farms would only get by setting aside 15 per cent of
their land, for which the larger farms would not get recompense. The
Commission has persistently argued that the big farmers who benefit most
from the CAP budget of Ecu35.3bn (Pounds 25bn) get about 20 per cent more
than they need to remain competitive.
The main cloud over CAP reform now appears to be the outcome of the Uruguay
Round trade liberalisation talks, where final agreement is being held up by
the inability of the EC and US to agree on farm subsidy cuts. In particular,
they disagree about whether compensation payments under CAP reform would be
allowed into the Gatt 'green box', permitting subsidies which do not promote
production and distort trade.
Ministers yesterday eased their opposition slightly to Gatt's demand that
the EC restrict the volume of its subsidised exports, as well as the amount
of the subsidy, indicating that a mix of the two could be acceptable.
But the council unanimously rejected a Gatt panel's verdict - formally
announced yesterday - outlawing the EC's new oilseeds regime. This regime
was designed to comply with an earlier Gatt ruling which found that the EC
discriminated against US oilseeds, which are allowed into the Community
duty-free under a 1962 Gatt agreement.
Ministers judged that the panel had exceeded its remit in condemning the
oilseed subsidies - copied from the CAP reform blueprint  - as an incentive
to producers. By deriving their judgment from the Uruguay Round conclusions
of last December - which the EC has not accepted  - the Gatt was prejudging
the 'green box' negotiations, ministers concluded.
A senior Commission official added that the US attitude to the EC across all
the Gatt fronts where the two sides are in dispute was 'come out with your
hands up'.
Mr Gummer argued that US baulking at liberalisation of services within the
Uruguay Round was now a greater stumbling block than agriculture, and warned
Washington against bullying.
'The Americans have got to learn that this is an international negotiation
in which they are not the imperial power, and we are negotiating with them
on equal terms,' he said.

PLATINUM stood out in a lack-lustre precious metals market yesterday, with
its price putting on Dollars 4.25 at Dollars 358 a troy ounce. Traders
attributed the rise to a statement by Russia's Almazyuvelirexport saying it
would retain its monopoly on exports of platinum group metals. 'The market
was just relieved that the platinum will remain in secure hands and traded
up in the absence of anything else to go on,' one dealer explained. Earlier
news that Russia was giving its foreign trade bank Vneshtorgbank a monopoly
on gold sales raised concerns that Almaz might lose control of platinum and
that supplies of the white metal might be allowed to flood on to the market.
Constructive US economic indicators helped most base metals prices to end
firm at the London Metal Exchange. The most notable rise was in the NICKEL
market, where the cash quotation closed Dollars 60 up at Dollars 7,400 a

FT  01 APR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: LME aluminium stocks show first
fall since August
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ALUMINIUM STOCKS in London Metal Exchange warehouses have fallen for the
first time since early August but analysts suggested yesterday this did not
mark the start of a downward trend.
Mr Nick Moore, analyst at Ord Minnett, part of the Westpac banking group,
said the 425-tonne fall was 'a milestone' but cautioned that there was still
a great deal of Russian aluminium to be exported to the west to swell stocks
this year.
Mr Angus MacMillan, analyst at Billiton-Enthoven Metals, a member of the
Royal Dutch/Shell group, said the outlook for aluminium demand in the second
quarter was not particularly bright.
Even if production stayed flat, demand would have to rise 2.5 per cent this
year just to hold stocks at present levels, he pointed out.
The market was anticipating a bigger stocks fall and aluminium for delivery
in three months closed Dollars 2.25 a tonne down last night at Dollars
1,318. This was nearly Dollars 225 a tonne above the lowest price reached in
the present recession in late December.
This week's stock fall came about because less metal arrived in European
warehouses and there were withdrawals from LME north American warehouses.
Demand is certainly picking up in the US. Mr Paul O'Neill, chairman of
Alcoa, the biggest north American aluminium group, said recently that
volumes were up across the board in January and February and bookings from
makers of cans, cars and consumer durables and from the building and
construction sector had all increased.
Alcoa had contacted some of its clients and they had all said their buying
was backed by a genuine improvement in US demand.
While Alcoa did not want to give exact details for commercial reasons, Mr
O'Neill said that, if the group's orders in August last year were at 50 on
an index, from November to February the index would be 120 to 125.

FT  01 APR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Computer-controlled trucks go
for gold - How Modular Mining dug into the vehicle dispatch business
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT CANNOT be often that a company invests Dollars 2.5m and immediately
covers the cost. But that happened when American Barrick Resources, the
Canadian gold mining group, bought a computer-based truck dispatch system
for its big Goldstrike gold mine in Nevada.
Mr Bob Smith, Barrick's president recalls: 'The package cost Dollars 2.5m
and we immediately saved 10 to 15 per cent of our haulage truck
requirements. That's three trucks at Dollars 1.4m each'.
Then came productivity gains from the system, which enables a central
dispatcher to know where every haulage truck and big mechanical shovel is at
every second of the working day in the huge open pit. Mr Smith points out:
'There's often Dollars 80,000 of gold on one of our 190-tonne trucks. If
that's accidentally dumped as waste, that's a big loss. The system
double-checks, so there are fewer losses. In mining you've gotta roll with
the punches. Nothing is ever the way you expect and the computer reacts
faster than the human brain'.
The truck dispatch system concept is a simple one: to link shovels, trucks
and dump points at a big mine together using a central computer connected
via a radio network to microcomputers on the equipment.
This collects real-time data and makes assignment decisions as well as
general reports for management.
But it is far from easy to put the concept into effect. One company, Modular
Mining of Tucson, Arizona, seems to have a monopoly.
Mr James White, MM's executive vice-president says: 'Several other companies
claim to offer similar technology, but as yet have failed to make a sale.
Several mines thought the problem was simple and developed one-of-a-kind,
in-house systems over the years. We have replaced such systems in Australia,
Canada, Papua New Guinea and South Africa'.
He says, for example, at RTZ's huge Palabora open pit copper mine in South
Africa, where there are three main ore types, numerous dumps, 20 different
waste categories, three crushers feeding five storage pads and multiple
composite blasts, MM's dispatch system improved productivity by 7 per cent
compared with the in-house one it replaced.
The list of MM's new clients last year included De Beers in South Africa,
Gecamines in Zaire and Southern Peru Copper, as well as Kennecott, the RTZ
copper-gold subsidiary, in the US, and Echo Bay's McCoy/Cove gold mine in
Nevada.
Use of the system does not, of course, alway produce results as dramatic as
those at American Barrick. At Kennecott's Bingham Canyon copper mine, the
dispatch system was installed last summer because Kennecott believed it
could win a modest productivity improvement, while ensuring that its
expensive in-pit ore crusher and conveyor system would always be kept fully
occupied. Mr Rod Davey, vice-president and general manager of operations at
Bingham, says no substantial improvements could be expected from the truck
and shovel fleet, given that the equipment is spread along five miles of
roads in the pit, which is 5,000 feet deep.
Ultimately, the MM system achieved what he expected - a 2 per cent
improvement - and, also as predicted, it seems likely to pay for itself in
three years.
Mr Davey says his company looked at several potential suppliers for a truck
dispatch system 'but Modular had a bit of a track record so we chose them'.
So success is breeding success. But it took a great deal of tenacity by the
founders before MM could build its present monopoly.
Mr White recalls that at one stage in the early days the office
drinking-water cooler was removed to save Dollars 7.50 a month.
He was a professor of chemical engineering at the University of Arizona's
College of Mines and joined up with Phelps Dodge, the biggest copper mining
group in the US, to develop the truck dispatch system that was first used in
PD's Tyrone mine in 1980 and later at its flagship Morenci mine. He was
joined by Mr Michael Arnold, a colleague from the university, who is now
MM's president, and Mr Mark Baker, a consulting engineer who represented PD
in the early days. Mr Baker is senior vice-president.
MM started in business just as the mining industry was plunged into the
worst recession in living memory. Banks shied away from a company with
'mining' in its name but Mr White recalls: 'We persevered, tightened our
belts, took sizeable salary cuts, watched every dime - that's when the water
cooler was removed - and used home equity, personal revolving lines of
credit and personal credit cards to provide needed cash flow'.
MM completed a survey in 1982 which showed that there were then only 370
mines of a size to justify the use of its technology. With such a small
prospective client base, it decided to contact companies directly.
Eventually this paid off with the first contract outside the PD organisation
 -with Quintette Coal for its Tumbler Ridge mine in British Columbia in
January, 1983.
During these direct contacts Mr White emphasises that the system - which MM
calls, would you believe, Dispatch - can help to manage almost the entire
mining operation once installed. It picks the best haul routes in open pit
mines. It monitors pit disturbances and adjusts the haulage flow pattern to
exploit present mine conditions. It tracks equipment delays and equipment
breakdowns, adjusting its instructions to compensate.
Management can ask the system 'what if?' questions to see how changes such
as big shovel moves, new dump placements, digging rate variations and shovel
priority schemes, would affect production.
Dispatch also allows management to determine truck and shovel efficiencies
by fleet or by individual items of equipment and to analyse each segment of
the haulage cycle to evaluate the performance of tyres, engine parts an so
on. The system monitors vital signs on vehicles, such as oil pressure, wheel
motor currents, so that maintenance personnel can monitor a vehicle while it
is working and spot potential problems before they cause expensive down
time, says Mr White.
However, Kennecott's Mr Davey points out that there is a danger of the user
being swamped by all this. 'It can become a question of doing less and less
with more and more data,' he says. 'The system is not a panacea. Management
must continue to manage.'
There is also a potentially controversial aspect to the system. It might
well be seen as a 'spy in the cab' or part of a regime where 'Big Brother'
is watching the drivers. Mr White says one of its benefits is that:
'Dispatch watches operator actions. Drivers can no longer grab an extra ten
minute smoke break at a far dump. The system alerts the dispatcher within
seconds whenever the operator is late.'
However, Mr Davey at Kennecott suggests that a majority of his drivers have
welcomed the system. 'It gives them something to fool with and they feel
more a part of the team. It sometimes gets boring in those cabs. Also we
would never use the system to compare the performance of one driver with
another.'
At American Barrick, Mr Smith also says the system need not necessarily sap
employee morale. 'Okay, it stops drivers taking some sneaky time out but it
also tells them when they must take a break - sometimes when the supervisor
might want them to keep working,' he points out.
American Barrick also arranged for employees to benefit from the
productivity gains arising from the use of Dispatch. A bonus system was
implemented based on the tonnage of ore mined, ounces of gold produced, the
mine's safety record and production cost. This has been giving drivers an
extra Dollars 240 each a month to add to their basic pay of Dollars 16 an
hour.

FT  01 APR 92 / International Bonds: Norway and Abbey National launch
ambitious deals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TWO bold new issues finally broke a period of drought in the international
bond market, with Norway and Abbey National launching substantial benchmark
deals.
Norway came with a Dollars 1bn five-year offering, lead-managed by Deutsche
Bank Capital Markets, which underwrote around 60 per cent of the deal. The 7
1/4 per cent paper was priced to yield 25 basis points more than US Treasury
bonds, a level seen as fair by market participants.
Demand for Eurodollar bonds remains lacklustre and the deal was seen as
ambitious in scale by underwriting firms. Some said that only 55 per cent of
the bonds had been placed with investors by the end of the day; others
estimated up to 80 per cent of the paper was firmly in the hands of
investors.
Against this, Norway's earlier Dollars 1bn five-year Eurodollar issue was
launched in November last year to yield 28 basis points more than US
Treasuries and was yesterday trading at a yield spread of 12 to 15 basis
points. The good performance of the earlier deal had encouraged investors to
buy new bonds, syndicate officials said.
Buying was reported from central banks, which are mostly restricted to
buying large, sovereign bond issues. Many firms also saw interest from
institutional investors in Asia.
The paper was re-offered to investors at a fixed price of 99.58, and by the
close of trading in London was quoted by the lead manager at 99.65 bid, for
a yield spread of 26 basis points over US government bonds.
In the afternoon, Abbey National surprised the market with a Pounds 250m
five-year issue, wholly underwritten by Barclays de Zoete Wedd.
The 10 1/2 per cent bonds were priced to yield 30 basis points more than UK
government bonds, seen as aggressive by many market participants. However,
BZW said that it had identified firm demand for the bonds - including demand
from a specialist investor requiring a sterling asset to back a structured
financing.
The issue follows recent 25-year and 10-year subordinated Eurosterling
issues by Abbey National. Mr Gareth Jones, treasurer, said that the creation
of liquid benchmarks would ease Abbey National's path to the sterling bond
market in future. The paper was re-offered to investors at a fixed price of
99.498, a level held by BZW until the close of trading.
Prudential Funding Corporation, the funding subsidiary of the US insurance
company, launched a CDollars 125m five-year issue, lead-managed by UBS
Phillips &amp; Drew. The retail-targetted paper was designed to attract
investors with maturing Canadian dollar bonds and a positive view of the
outlook for the currency.
The 9 1/8 per cent bonds were re-offered to investors at a fixed price of
99.625, for a yield spread of 47 basis points more than Canadian government
bonds.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Australia and New Zealand Banking Group (ANZ) yesterday dropped plans
for a commercial partnership with National Mutual Life, nearly two years
after the Australian government vetoed plans for a ADollars 3.4bn (USDollars
2.6bn) merger.
Mr Will Bailey, ANZ chief executive, said detailed negotiations had failed
to find a structure which would allow joint control of important business
areas while conforming with federal competition law.
The two groups set up working parties to discuss ways of increasing
co-operation after Mr Paul Keating, then Australia's treasurer, blocked the
proposed merger on competition grounds in May 1990.
Mr Keating said the merger would have substantially reduced competition in
the life insurance market, which is dominated by a handful of banks and
pension funds.
The effect of his ruling was to enshrine in law the independence of the
country's six biggest financial institutions. ANZ is the second largest
bank, and National Mutual is the second largest life office.
Mr Bailey said detailed analysis of the groups' funds management,
information technology and product distribution operations had confirmed
that a merger was 'clearly the best option for both parties'.
He said the groups had identified areas in which gains could be made from
joint control, but had been 'unable to find a structure which would meet
each company's requirements and also fall within the government
restrictions'.
However, Mr Bailey said the two groups would co-operate on broader
commercial issues such as capital raisings, systems costs and distribution
of a limited range of products.
Mr Gil Hoskins, managing director of National Mutual, said policy-holders
would benefit from 'a loose alliance which leaves scope for the development
of other connections and arrangements within the financial sector'.
He said ANZ wanted to maintain an independent position in the superannuation
and life insurance markets rather than enter a partnership short of a
merger.
'Therefore it is impractical to continue to be aligned with them,' he said.

MR Chung Ju Yung, the founder and former chairman of Hyundai, the Korean

Mr Chung is likely to transfer most of his shares, valued at Dollars 2.6bn,
to his younger brother, Mr Chung Se Yung, the Hyundai chairman.
Mr Chung said, however, he may sell some of his shareholding to raise funds
for his new political party, the Unification National Party (UNP), which
gained a pivotal parliamentary position in last week's National Assembly
elections.
The disposal of the shares is also aimed at increasing the UNP's popular
appeal by distancing it from Hyundai.

FT  01 APR 92 / International Company News: Braced for a second dose of
deregulation - An uneasy welcome to plans to further liberalise Australia's
airline industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LESS than 18 months after the Australian government swept away decades of
strict regulation, the country's aviation industry is struggling to come to
terms with a further dramatic dose of deregulation.
Mr Paul Keating, the prime minister, appeared to offer something for
everyone when he announced plans to 'revolutionise' the industry by creating
a common aviation market in Australia and New Zealand.
The announcement followed calls from New Zealand for greater access to the
Australian domestic market, and it seemed to offer significant opportunities
to the three big Australian airlines.
However, the Keating plan has added to the confusion in the industry as it
counts the cost of two years of economic recession and a bitter fares war
sparked by deregulation.
And while the airlines involved have been careful to welcome the proposals,
they seem daunted by the dangers of open competition in a joint market of
just 20m people.
Under the Keating plan, Qantas, the government-owned international carrier,
would gain access to Australian domestic routes next year, and the Tasman
Sea route to New Zealand would be opened to Australian Airlines, the
government-owned domestic carrier, and Ansett Australia, a private domestic
carrier jointly owned by TNT and News Corporation.
A second stage, to be completed by 1994, would create a common aviation
border, within which Australian and New Zealand airlines would have
unrestricted access to all routes, including the Tasman.
The plan also reverses a government ban on cross-shareholdings between the
three Australian airlines, raising the prospect of equity links between
Qantas and one of the two domestic carriers.
Mr Keating told parliament that these 'great changes to our national
transport system will make our continent smaller and our nation greater'.
But, in the short term, the plan seems more likely to compound the
industry's problems.
Australian and Ansett are still struggling to come to terms with the
abolition of the duopoly they enjoyed until October 1990, when the
government deregulated domestic aviation as the economy was heading into
recession.
Only one new airline - Compass Airlines  - entered the market, but its entry
sparked a price war which helped push both big airlines into losses in
1990-91, and ended with the collapse of Compass just before Christmas.
Although fares have since stabilised, Sir Peter Abeles, joint chairman of
Ansett, says the airline is likely to make a loss for the year to June
because of heavy losses in the first half. Analysts say Australian is in a
similar position.
Both airlines face the possibility of renewed competition from mid-year when
Compass is expected to re-enter the market following a deal between the
liquidator and Southern Cross Airlines, another potential new entrant.
Several other airlines are thought to be at the planning stage.
Competitive pressures would intensify if Qantas and Air New Zealand joined
the domestic fray. Qantas has about 15,000 vacant seats a week on the
Australian legs of international flights, compared with about 120,000 on the
two domestic airlines.
The Keating plan raises questions over the government's efforts to privatise
49 per cent of Qantas and 100 per cent of Australian. The sales have
attracted informal interest from British Airways and several Pacific region
airlines, including Air New Zealand, Garuda Indonesia, Singapore Airlines,
Japan Air Lines and North West Airlines of the US.
However, the regulatory changes will delay progress towards formal offers,
while the potential bidders consider the unpredictable consequences of the
new regime. Qantas, for example, might gain from the ability to sell empty
seats to domestic passengers, but could lose from increased competition on
the Tasman.
Mr John Ward, chief executive of Qantas, says the announcement leaves the
privatisation process 'confused'. Officials say the sales will almost
certainly have to be put back to next year. 'It's a mess,' says one.
New Zealand is threatening to block the creation of a common Australasian
market unless Air New Zealand is given full international rights for flights
passing through Australia.
Mr Rob Storey, New Zealand's transport minister, says these so-called
'beyond rights' would 'form an integral part' of a single aviation market,
and would have to be granted in advance by Australia.
Officials will begin discussions on the issue shortly, but the omens for
compromise do not look good. 'The Kiwis are just trying it on; there is not
a hope that we will agree,' says an Australian official.
Even if the beyond rights dispute can be overcome, there seems to be limited
scope for further competition on the Tasman, where Qantas and Air New
Zealand are already sharing aircraft on some routes because of
over-capacity.
Against this background, the package left the airlines distinctly
under-whelmed. In the five weeks since Mr Keating announced his proposals,
none has come forward with plans to take advantage of them.
Ansett, for example, says it may seek to fly across the Tasman to link its
Australian and New Zealand domestic services, but would consider other
international operations only in exceptional circumstances.
'It has got to be a very special operation because . . . the European and
American markets are so oversupplied with airlines now that it will be a
cut-throat operation for a long time,' says Sir Peter.
Nor would Ansett seek to purchase a stake in Qantas, because of the
government's intention to retain a 51 per cent shareholding. 'We like to
have control,' Sir Peter says.
Mr John Schaap, managing director of Australian Airlines, told an aviation
conference recently that Australian would not 'charge in at the first
opportunity, at any cost' just because it had been given the right to
compete for international routes.
'To do so would be a very risky exercise, in which we would be seeking a
slice of somebody else's business, and they would seek to protect
themselves, possibly by seeking a slice of our established business,' he
said.
In spite of their caution, the airlines will be investigating their options
over the next few months. But with the example of Compass before them, they
are unlikely to lose sight of the possible consequences of another fares war
caused by overcapacity.
Such a battle, says Mr Schaap, could easily 'destroy' one of the airlines.
And that, the airlines all agree, is not likely to be in anyone's interests.

FT  01 APR 92 / International Company News: Bank Hapoalim set back by farm
debt legislation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   JERUSALEM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CONTROVERSIAL legislation enforcing the forgiveness of agricultural debt hit
another of Israel's banks yesterday when Bank Hapoalim - the country's
largest in terms of asset value - reported a 26 per cent fall in 1991 net
profits, down to Shk135.7m (Dollars 56.3m) from Shk183m the previous year.
The legislation, which requires banks to write off big chunks of the
outstanding Shk2bn debt of the Moshavim collective farms, was passed by the
Knesset earlier this month. The Bank of Israel has advised commercial banks
to make the resulting provisions in their 1991 accounts.
Bank Hapoalim, the last of the five leading banks to report, had to double
its planned provisions for the agricultural sector to Shk492m, pushing
overall provisions up 47 per cent to Shk991m.
Although it managed to stay in the black - unlike its chief rival, Bank
Leumi - Bank Hapoalim saw a potential significant advance turned into a
decline. Return on capital fell to 4.7 per cent from 6.2 per cent the
previous year.
The bank, controlled by the Histadrut trade union federation but
majority-owned by the government, said that in other respects it had
improved performance. Financing income, at Shk2.1 bn, was up almost 8 per
cent, an improvement attributed to loan portfolio restructuring and improved
margins.
Non-financing income rose by 11.5 per cent to Shk935m as the bank increased
its activities in areas such as brokerage and underwriting. The contribution
from subsidiaries and affiliates increased to Shk54m from Shk25m. Total
assets were down 2 per cent at Shk84.7bn.

FT  01 APR 92 / International Company News: PosGold wins investor support
for ACM deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
POSEIDON Gold (PosGold), part of Mr Robert Champion de Crespigny's Normandy
Poseidon group, looks set to achieve one of two attempted mergers after
shareholders in ACM Gold voted in favour by a narrow margin.
The merger was approved by a margin of less than 1 per cent of investors,
reflecting dissatisfaction among some small shareholders about the terms
offered by PosGold.
However, the vote means Mr de Crespigny has won approval for the more
important element of his plans to turn PosGold into Australia's third
largest gold producer, with annual production of more than 700,000 ounces.
The plan suffered a setback when shareholders in Mount Leyshon Gold Mines
voted for a merger with PosGold, but by an insufficient margin to satisfy
the company's articles of association.
The merger proposal is part of a simplification of the Normandy Poseidon
group structure. It would also give PosGold direct control of Mount Leyshon
and ACM Gold assets.
ACM Gold is 40 per cent owned by Normandy Poseidon following a recent joint
takeover of Australian Consolidated Minerals with Western Mining
Corporation. Mount Leyshon is 49 per cent owned by PosGold.
Mr de Crespigny is expected to offer improved terms to Mount Leyshon

provided a premium for control.
If the two deals go through, PosGold will have a strong presence in three of
Australia's biggest gold provinces - Kalgoorlie, Tennant Creek and Charters
Towers.

FT  01 APR 92 / International Equity Issues: Wellcome names lead managers
for share sale
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY

<TEXT>
WELLCOME Trust, the medical charity, has appointed lead managers for its
planned international sale of shares in Wellcome, the drugs group. The trust
is aiming to reduce its stake from 73.6 per cent to under 50 per cent and
possibly as low as 25 per cent.
The sale is expected in July, although timing will depend on market
conditions. At yesterday's closing share price of Pounds 10.49, up 27p, the
sale could raise Pounds 4.4bn. That would make it the largest private-sector
sale in the UK. As such, it carries a lot of prestige and may prove to be a
highly profitable sale for the lead managers.
Although all the managers appointed are leading houses, there will be
disappointment among those that have not been selected. Salomon Brothers,
for example, was understood to have hoped to manage a portion of the US
tranche. However, Salomon was apparently ruled out because its analysts had
not written research on Wellcome in the US and under US rules could not
start doing so when an offer was under way.
The trust must gain the consent of the High Court to cut its stake below 50
per cent. A hearing is expected in the second half of April.
The share sale is to be run along the lines of the BT sale last autumn when
a substantial stake in an already quoted company was sold. In that sale,
large investors were asked to put in bids for shares in order to assess
demand and set a price.
The final structure of the sale has yet to be determined. The proportions
allocated to different markets will depend on local demand, but the same
price will prevail in all markets.
Wellcome was involved in the appointment of the lead managers and said
yesterday that it gave full support.
Robert Fleming, the merchant bank, had already been appointed as global
co-ordinator for the sale while Baring Brothers advises the company.
The regional syndicates' lead managers are Cazenove and S G Warburg
Securities in the UK; Morgan Stanley, Lehman Brothers and Merrill Lynch in
the US; Nikko Securities and Nomura Securities in Japan; Swiss Bank
Corporation in Switzerland; Credit Lyonnais and Banque Indosuez in France;
Dresdner Bank and Deutsche Bank in Germany and Jardine Fleming for the
Pacific Rim.
Robert Fleming will cover the rest of the world including European countries
not covered individually, Canada and the Middle East.

FT  01 APR 92 / International Company News: BHP seeks approval for takeover
of NZ Steel
</HEADLINE>

   WELLINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BHP, Australia's largest company, is seeking statutory approval to mount a
full takeover of New Zealand Steel, from authorities in both countries. NZ
Steel is a world leader in advanced technology to convert iron to steel.
A previous bid by BHP met with opposition in both countries on monopoly
grounds. BHP is the only significant steel producer in Australasia.
This is the latest twist in a lengthy battle for control of the plant, which
was expanded by the National government in the early 1980s as part of a
'think big' strategy to make New Zealand industrially independent and create
jobs. One of the Labour government's first acts in 1985 was to announce it
was selling its controlling shareholding.
It had to write off NZDollars 1.5bn (USDollars 822m) before selling the
Glenbrok mill to Equiticorp for NZDollars 327m in 1987.
NZ Steel was then sold to a joint venture between BHP and various New
Zealand-based interests for NZDollars 323m, against opposition from Fletcher
Challenge.
To secure control of NZ Steel, BHP is again seeking approval from the
Australian Trade Practices Commission which opposed BHP gaining a
shareholding in 1989 on the grounds that NZ Steel was one of BHP's few
competitors in the Australian market.
It took court action to secure a compromise with BHP who undertook not to
inhibit NZ Steel from marketing steel products in Australia and to seek
approval before seeking to increase its shareholding.
The New Zealand Commerce Commission approved the takeover.
The commission said that BHP effectively controlled New Zealand Steel
through a joint venture with Steel and Tube, a New Zealand-based metals
concern which was part of the consortium making the bid, and which in turn
was controlled by another BHP subsidiary Tubemakers of Australia.
The other members of the consortium are Fisher and Paykel and the ANZ
Banking Group.
Mr Scott Kerr, managing director of BHP Trading in New Zealand, said that NZ
Steel needed an injection of capital which the other shareholders were not
in a position to contribute.
BHP wanted to finance capital spending at the mill, he said. This would lead
to economies within the company with opportunities to rationalise exporting
and freight costs, he added.

MR CHENG Yu Tung's New World Development has exceeded expectations with a
166 per cent rise in interim net earnings, to HKDollars 939.2m (USDollars
121m) from HKDollars 352.4m, in the six months to December 31.
This marks a significant improvement for New World, which earned a net
HKDollars 1.16bn in the year to June 20 1991. A dividend of HK 21 cents was
declared, up 31 per cent from HK 16 cents last time.
Directors said they expected even better results in the second half. They
said the outlook was encouraging, given south China's economic development
and the determination of Beijing to quicken the pace of economic reform in
China.
New World is one of Hong Kong's biggest hoteliers and property developers,
with interests throughout Asia, and the US. It also has interests in
southern Chinese infrastructure developments and transport in Hong Kong.
During the half-year, income from property sales rose HKDollars 471.7m to
HKDollars 644.9m. Profits from hotels and restaurants rose 35 per cent to
HKDollars 283m, while rental income rose 11.4 per cent to HKDollars 525.2m.
The company said its hotel occupancy levels had improved during the last
half of 1991 and this had continued into this year. In China, where the
market has been depressed, higher tourist arrivals were expected to underpin
better results.
In the first half, Ramada International Hotels and Resorts opened 13 hotels
worldwide.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE fight for survival between Canada's two leading airlines has intensified
with a vow by Air Canada to use every weapon at its disposal to block an
alliance between Canadian Airlines International and American Airlines,
based in Dallas.
Mr Hollis Harris, Air Canada's newly-appointed chief executive, said the
Montreal-based airline would lodge a strong protest with the federal
government against its rival's proposed deal, which is at an advanced stage
of negotiation.
In addition, Air Canada has demanded immediate access to the lucrative
trans-Pacific route to Japan currently reserved for Canadian. Air Canada
also wants to be allocated half of Canadian's slots at Japanese airports.
American Airlines has proposed acquiring a minority equity stake in Canadian
and forging a comprehensive operating alliance. Air Canada and Canadian lost
almost CDollars 400m (USDollars 336m) between them last year, and it is
widely assumed that neither can survive in its present state. But the two
carriers are pursuing different solutions to their problems.
Air Canada has pressed for some form of merger, leading later to an alliance
with one of the emerging multinational airline groups. It hopes to generate
public sympathy by insisting that Canadian's deal with American would
inexorably lead to one of the country's most visible businesses being
swallowed by a foreign giant.
But PWA, Canadian Airlines' parent, sees the deal with one of the strongest
US carriers as a way of giving itself immediate protection, as well as
greater access to the valuable US market.
PWA responded to Mr Hollis' statement by insisting that its proposed
alliance with American 'will minimise job loss and maintain competition in
Canada'.
PWA said its discussions with American were 'progressing well and we plan to
see them through to their conclusion'.
The government has yet to show its hand. One Toronto analyst said that,
provided American is willing to limit its equity stake to 25 per cent, the
argument that a merger will lead to huge job losses and a monopoly in the
domestic market is likely to carry considerable weight in Ottawa.

<TEXT>
CORNING, the US specialty glass group, yesterday unveiled a 21 per cent
increase in underlying first-quarter earnings.
Stripping-out extraordinary items, Corning said it earned Dollars 56.4m, or
30 cents a share, in the latest quarter.
Net income for the first three months of 1992 was Dollars 78.1m, or 41 cents
a share, against Dollars 48.4m, or 26 cents, a year earlier. The figures
include one-time gains in both years.
Net sales rose 15 per cent to Dollars 793.2m from Dollars 691.2m the
previous year, fuelled by strength in Corning's laboratory services
business.
Mr James Houghton, chairman, said the company's fibre and cable businesses
were showing a seasonal upturn and a return to strong year-on-year growth.
The weak US economy, however, hurt results of Corning's consumer products
and specialty materials operations.
On Wall Street, shares in Corning were Dollars 1 1/8 higher at Dollars 33
7/8 in an advancing market.
The company's stock has been battered in recent months by controversy
surrounding the silicone breast implants manufactured by Dow Corning, a
50-50 joint venture between Corning and Dow Chemical.
Dow Corning said recently it was withdrawing entirely from the silicone
breast implant business.
Although the devices account for less than 1 per cent of Dow Corning's
Dollars 2bn annual sales, there is growing concern that Corning may be
vulnerable if Dow Corning is flooded with successful law suits.
Mr Houghton has said the suits would not have a material effect on Dow
Corning's financial position.
In 1991, Corning's equity earnings from Dow Corning were reduced by Dollars
8.2m after Dow Corning took a Dollars 16.4m fourth quarter after-tax charge
related to the implants.

AEGON, one of the leading insurance groups in the Netherlands, yesterday
reported a 10.5 per cent increase in 1991 net profit, to Fl 827m (Dollars
445m) from Fl 749m. Group operating income climbed to Fl 712.8m from Fl
645m.
Aegon said total revenue advanced to Fl 13.6bn from Fl 12.04bn, an increase
of 13.2 per cent. Of this, premium income generated Fl 7.9bn, up Fl 750m.
Investment and other income accounted for Fl 4.89bn, an increase of Fl 843m.
Aegon turned in a strong performance in the life insurance sector in its two
main geographical markets, the US and the Netherlands.
The operating result from the life insurance business rose to Fl 721m from
Fl 624m. This more than compensated for a continued weakness in its other
European markets, where operating losses more than doubled to Fl 19m,
concentrated in the accident, health and general insurance sectors.
Aegon is forecasting 'a clear increase' in 1992 operating income, which, on
a per-share basis, will 'at least equal' the Fl 15.45 last year.
The board has proposed a dividend of Fl 7.35 per share, an increase of Fl
0.25.

GEMINA, the Italian investment and financial services group controlled by
Fiat, raised pre-tax parent company profits for the first half of its
1991-1992 financial year to L30.8bn (Dollars 24.85m) from L23.2bn last time.
However, consolidated pre-tax earnings in the six months to December 31 fell
to L130.9bn from L142.5bn. Gemina forecast that parent company earnings this
financial year would be in line with those in 1990-91.
The book value of its holdings rose by L339.8bn to L1,494bn, largely because
of rights issues at RCS Editori and Fila, two companies under Gemina's
control.
Parmalat Finanziaria, the holding company which controls the big Italian
foods group of the same name, raised net group profits to L42bn last year
from L6bn in 1990, due partly to a 20 per cent jump in sales to L1,327bn and
a L9bn drop in interest charges to L70bn.
The company is to pay an increased dividend of L115 a share.

<TEXT>
SAGA PETROLEUM, Norway's biggest independent oil company, is planning to
issue up to 7m new shares which could raise NKr600m (Dollars 93m), the
company confirmed yesterday.
Mr John Sandberg, a Saga executive, said the board would meet soon to agree
details of the planned capital increase.
The new capital would be used for acquisitions within the oil sector, Mr
Sandberg said. Last autumn, Saga said it was seeking international
expansion.
Mr Sandberg said Saga's board would seek authority to issue the shares from
the general assembly at a meeting scheduled for May 7. Yesterday, Saga's
A-shares closed unchanged at NKr73 in Oslo.
Last year, Saga held talks about acquiring the Norwegian North Sea oil and
gas assets of DNO, a small oil company connected with Mr Torstein Hagen, the
Norwegian financier. The talks, however, foundered on the valuation of DNO's
assets.
In August, Saga will bring its first oilfield, Snorre, on stream in two
phases. Investment in the entire development is about NKr30bn, NKr21bn of
which will cover the first phase development.
Snorre contains 106m standard cubic metres of oil, 6.7bn cubic metres of gas
and 3.2m tonnes of natural gas liquids.
The company is also developing another oil field, Tordis, which is much
smaller than Snorre with oil reserves of 18m standard cubic metres of oil.
The field, slated to come on stream in the second half of 1994, will cost
NKr3bn to develop.
Saga is also studying development alternatives for the Vigdis oilfield,
which it declared commercial last October.

<TEXT>
GROUPE BULL, France's state-controlled computer group which recently
concluded an alliance with IBM of the US, managed to reduce its losses from
FFr6.79bn in 1990 to FFr3.3bn (Dollars 589m) in 1991 despite the intense
competition in the international computer industry.
Mr Francis Lorentz, Bull's chairman, attributed the improvement to the
radical restructuring programme implemented by Bull last year.
This programme, which involved overhauling products and cutting the
worldwide workforce by 9,000 people, or 19 per cent, in 1991 was designed to
cut costs and improve efficiency.
However, Mr Lorentz warned that Bull anticipated another tough year in 1992.
'We must redouble our efforts to adapt to a world market which is still in '
he said.
Bull earlier this year restructured its debt by securing an international
credit facility of Dollars 1.1bn.
Bull sustained a fall in overall sales of 3.1 per cent from FFr34.6bn in
1990 to FFr33.5bn in 1991. Its hardware sales are believed to have fallen -
by 4 per cent in Europe and North America  - for the first time.
The company managed to counter this with its cost-cutting programme which
involved reducing its production plants from 13 to five as well as job
losses.
The cost of restructuring was higher than originally expected. Bull was
forced to make a provision of FFr675m for restructuring in 1991 in addition
to the provision of FFr3.62bn made in its 1990 accounts.
The alliance with IBM, which involves the two companies swapping technical
know-how, will lead to the US group investing Dollars 100m in Bull for 5.7
per cent of its shares. NEC of Japan last year took 4.7 per cent of Bull in
return for ceding its shares in the French company's US subsidiary.

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MOODY'S, the US credit rating agency, yesterday lowered ratings of four
Japanese banks.
The move comes at a time when the balance of bad loans is increasing sharply
at Japanese financial institutions.
Their problems are traced back to the late 1980s, when loose credit controls
allowed banks to lend to land and stock speculators. Increasing concern over
deteriorating asset quality at the banks has led to banking shares being
sold off heavily in recent weeks.
Long and short-term ratings of Mitsui Trust and Banking were lowered to A3
and P-2 respectively. Moody's said the downgrading reflected concerns over
Mitsui Trust's long-term profitability.
Mitsui Trust is currently involved in the restructuring of troubled real
estate-related companies. Moody's also cited the bank's exposure to non-bank
financial institutions as a significant concern.
Moody's lowered Tokai Bank's long-term credit ratings from Aa3 to A1. It
said Tokai's commitment to aid Central Finance, a leasing affiliate which
was involved in a series of loan scandals, would squeeze the bank's profits.
The Bank of Tokyo saw its long-term ratings lowered from Aa2 to Aa3 on
concerns over deterioration of domestic and overseas assets, and
expectations of a profits squeeze due to financial deregulation.
Although the bank has little direct exposure to the domestic property
sector, Moody's said loans made to real estate and non-bank financial
institutions through affiliates were putting pressure on the bank's asset
quality.
The credit agency lowered the short-term credit rating for Hokuriku Bank, a
regional bank, to P-2. Hokuriku is a leading creditor of Nanatomi, the
property company which filed for bankruptcy last year with debts totalling
Y300bn (Dollars 2.3bn).

</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   HANOVER
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
KRUPP, the German steel and engineering group, put in a strong performance
in its last full year before the flotation due this summer.
Despite the pressures of recession overseas and stagnation in domestic
markets, the Essen-based company increased net earnings to DM300m (Dollars
182m) from DM217m last time, Mr Gerhard Cromme, chairman, said yesterday.
Hoesch, which will shortly be taken over by Krupp, fared less well.
Yesterday, it reported falling profits and announced plans for 2,800 job
cuts this year, following last year's reduction of 2,500.
While Mr Cromme strove to paint a relatively rosy picture to encourage
prospective shareholders, Mr Heinz Kriwet, Thyssen's chairman, pointed to a
uniformly black background.
Sales at Thyssen in the five months to the end of February had risen 1 per
cent to around DM15bn, but profits had continued to fall, he said.
Economic conditions had worsened since last year. 'We can see no signs of
improvement. The German economy is stagnating and we may be at the start of
a recession.'
Thyssen, the biggest of the three companies, was preparing for 'stormy
weather ahead,' and recovery might take very much longer than many people
now believed, Mr Kriwet said.
Sales at all three groups stagnated or showed minimum growth in 1991.
Turnover at Krupp was up just 2 per cent. At Hoesch, it was unchanged at
DM12.6bn, according to Mr Kajo Neukirchen, chairman.
Thyssen's figures, published in full two weeks ago, showed a 1 per cent rise
to DM36.6bn. The main causes were falling steel prices and fading demand in
Germany and abroad, the three chairmen agreed.
According to Mr Cromme, after-tax profits at Fried. Krupp, the core
operating business in the Krupp group, rose DM90m to DM200m, allowing it to
wipe out losses carried forward and post an unappropriated profit
unofficially estimated at DM50m.
Krupp Stahl, the steel subsidiary, held its ground in difficult conditions.
Results matched those of 1990, Mr Cromme said, hinting at a further dividend
payout. Krupp Stahl, at present the only quoted part of the group, last year
paid its first dividend - DM5  - for 16 years.
Mr Cromme also upgraded estimates of the benefits of the impending takeover
of Hoesch. He said the long-term 'positive effect' on results would be about
DM500m a year.
In the shorter term, however, he warned of 'suitable counter-measures'
needed to cope with the current downturn. 'The world economic setting in
1992 is much more difficult than last year,' he said.
The group would also have to work hard to merge Hoesch's complementary
activities in steel-making, plant-engineering, auto-components and trading,
to extract the maximum benefits as soon as possible.
The takeover of Hoesch is expected to be completed in July, despite an
unexpected dispute with the federal cartel office in Berlin. The office is
understood to be concerned that the merger will give the enlarged group too
big a share in the springs market.
Mr Neukirchen said overall his company had a satisfactory year. Although
after-tax profits were down, they were still well over DM200m, he said.

FT  01 APR 92 / UK Company News: BCCI liquidators oppose loan discharge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND HUGHES, Law Courts Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LIQUIDATORS of Bank of Credit and Commerce International are opposing a
move to discharge a debenture giving the bank a charge over all the assets
of Taplute, a company part-owned by Mr Nazmudin Virani's Control Securities.
The High Court yesterday adjourned Taplute's application to cancel the
debenture to enable the liquidators to put in evidence.
The dispute stems from a joint venture in September 1989 between Control
Securities and Batace, a company controlled by Mr Ghaith Pharaon, a Saudi
businessman who has been named by the US Federal Reserve as having acted as
a front man for BCCI in purchasing stakes in US banks.
The fruit of the joint venture was Taplute, which bought the Ocarina chain
of Spanish hotels from Bass, the brewing group, for Pounds 45m.
Mr Philip Heslop QC, for Taplute, told the court that Control and Batace
each provided Pounds 5m for the payment of the first tranche of the purchase
price, the Pounds 35m balance being guaranteed by BCCI.
As security for that guarantee BCCI was granted a debenture over all
Taplute's assets. Taplute had sought discharge of the debenture and offered
BCCI the Pounds 124,000 due on overdraft which Taplute claimed was all it
owed the bank.
However, last month the liquidators had demanded Pounds 7.1m, the additional
amount representing Pounds 5.8m transferred from Batace to Taplute in
September 1990, plus interest.
Taplute denied that it was liable for the additional amount, Mr Heslop said.
He read evidence in which Mr Virani stated that Taplute's account at BCCI
showed that in September 1990 it had received equal contributions from
Control and Batace towards the Pounds 11.6m second tranche due to Bass.
However, Mr Heslop said, the liquidators claimed to have unequivocal
evidence that Batace denied having made any payment in September 1990.
That evidence was a letter from Mr Farouk Zavahir, Mr Pharaon's UK
representative, stating that Batace had sold its interest in Taplute to Mr
Virani and Control.
Mr Virani denied such a sale had taken place and contended that it would
have been inconsistent with an agreement last November between Control,
Bellhaven (a Control subsidiary), Batace and Taplute.
Mr Charles Purle QC, for the liquidators, said they regarded the November
agreement with a great deal of reserve and suspicion. It appeared to have
been made primarily to enable Taplute to enter into an agreement with Bass
which would give Bass a security covering the same assets as the BCCI
debenture.

IMPROVED COST controls helped Nurdin &amp; Peacock, the cash and carry
wholesaler, lift pre-tax profits by 7 per cent to Pounds 27.6m for the year
to December 29.
The result was buoyed by interest receivable of Pounds 3.8m, compared with
Pounds 4.6m last time.
Mr David Poole, managing director, said the company had significantly cut
operating costs. For example, wages - which represent about 50 per cent of
the company's total costs - fell from 3.1 per cent of total sales to 2.7 per
cent.
Turnover advanced by 6.2 per cent to Pounds 1.37bn, although on a
like-for-like basis volume actually declined by 4.5 per cent. The move to
increase own-brand labels, such as Happy Shopper and Happy Chef, would
continue, Mr Poole said. The current proportion of own label - at 22 per
cent of turnover - was targeted to rise to 27 per cent.
Net margins were marginally higher at 2.02 per cent. Mr Poole said it was
unlikely that, in current trading conditions, margins could be increased
this year. 'We believe we have got to be competitive and watch the general
level of prices,' he said. However, the benefits of investment in laser
scanning and a move towards central buying were expected to help margins
next year.
By 1993, said Mr Poole, all of the branches would be fully converted to
laser scanning.
During the year, the company opened three new branches in Chester, Blackpool
and Sheffield, which accounted for Pounds 60m of the increase in turnover.
The new branches are not expected to make a profit for three years.
Capital expenditure was Pounds 3m higher at Pounds 35m. This year, the
company plans to spend Pounds 45m opening a further three branches, for a
total of 46, and extend the central distribution warehouse in Didcot.
Earnings per share fell from 15.6p to 15p, having been inflated in 1990 by a
deferred Pounds 1.9m tax credit. Excluding this, earnings per share rose by
1p to 15p. The final dividend is increased in line with profits to 3.6p for
a total of 5.56p (5.2p).
The shares closed down 8p at 156p.

FT  01 APR 92 / UK Company News: Watts Blake falls 27% and 'hard year' ahead
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRE-TAX profits at Watts Blake Bearne, the world's largest supplier of ball
clay, fell by 27 per cent, from Pounds 7.75m to Pounds 5.67m, in the year to
December 31.
Mr John Pike, managing director, said the results should be considered
against a background of falling demand for ceramic products in most of
Europe and North America.
Sales, however, rose by 9 per cent to Pounds 61.4m (Pounds 56.4m).
Exports to the Far East rose by 40 per cent to Pounds 4m. The group said it
had decided last month to increase its investments in the area underlining
its confidence in the future profitability of the Far East operations.
Turnover fell in both the UK and the US, mainly due the recession on both
sides of the Atlantic. In Devon Clays, for example, sales of ball clay for
facing bricks and china clay for paper fillers fell significantly.
Trading profit fell from Pounds 7.66m to Pounds 6.42m. Mr Pike said that
while certain markets could start to improve the group was assuming that
'another hard year lies ahead'.
Net borrowings increased to Pounds 10.2m (Pounds 4.7m), with interest
payable of Pounds 746,000 compared to Pounds 94,000 received.
Earnings per share fell from 26p to 18.9p. However, a final dividend of 6.6p
gives an unchanged total of 9.3p.

FT  01 APR 92 / UK Company News: Pounds 30m refinancing for Hawthorn Leslie
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HAWTHORN LESLIE, the mobile phone group, has agreed details of a Pounds 30m
financial restructuring with Svenska Handelsbanken, its bank.
The deal, which is subject to shareholder approval, involves Svenska
swapping Pounds 16m of the debt for convertible unsecured loan stock.
If the loan stock were converted into ordinary and preference shares,
Svenska would hold 29.9 per cent of Hawthorn's equity.
Of the remaining debt, Pounds 10m is to be designated as an overdraft while
Pounds 4.25m is to be a term loan and will be repaid from disposals and tax
rebates.
The restructuring also involves Svenska waiving interest on the debt,
including the loan stock, if it amounts to more than 75 per cent of
operating profits.
Hawthorn must, however, pay a minimum of Pounds 1m in interest a year.
Svenska said these were the only terms acceptable to it.
Even so, the company said there was a 'very narrow margin for contingencies'
in its projections and it might have to go to Svenska again for further
finance.
The aim of the restructuring is to get the company back to a position where
it can service its debt and develop its mobile phone business, which is
trading profitably. Its other activities have been sold, for Pounds 23m.
When the deal goes through, its balance sheet will show a deficit of Pounds
22m, which would fall to Pounds 6m if the loan stock is converted.
As such, the group is unlikely to pay dividends 'in the foreseeable future'.
Mr Andrew Hankey, deputy chairman, who joined the company last spring and
has been instrumental to the restructuring deal, is to become chairman.
An incentive scheme based on share options is to be instituted for the
management.
There is a shareholders meeting on April 28, but holders of just over 75 per
cent of the shares have given undertakings to vote in favour.
The USM-quoted shares are expected to return from suspension following the
meeting and publication of results for 1991.
Hawthorn said trading in the second half of 1991 was encouraging. A change
in accounting treatment will mean a restatement of 1990 figures, and reduce
the Pounds 11.9m loss for the first half of 1991 by Pounds 2.4m.
Hill Samuel, the merchant bank, has advised Hawthorn.

FT  01 APR 92 / UK Company News: TIP Europe advances to Pounds 3.72m - Fleet
cut by 1,000 but UK average daily rate rises by 11%
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
TIP EUROPE, the trailer rental group which was refinanced last November,
increased pre-tax profit by 51 per cent to Pounds 3.72m in the six months to
January 31.
On turnover of Pounds 54.9m (Pounds 53.3m), operating profit declined 12 per
cent to Pounds 11.3m (Pounds 12.8m). Interest costs were cut by Pounds 1.1m
to Pounds 7.59m as the group started to benefit from December's Pounds 29.2m
rights issue.
Interest cover was one of the stumbling blocks under the group's former
multi-option finance facility, since replaced by a more relaxed arrangement
with a 'club' of eight banks.
The pre-tax line compared with Pounds 2.46m last time, although this figure
was struck after a restructuring charge totalling Pounds 1.68m.
Pre-tax profit in trailer rental declined to Pounds 2.5m (Pounds 3.1m) on
turnover of Pounds 38.2m (Pounds 39.3m). A fall in profits on the Continent
was partially offset by a near Pounds 1m turnround in the UK.
Mr David Callear, chief executive, said the biggest success was an 11 per
cent increase in the average daily UK rate. The fleet had been cut from more
than 10,000 to less than 9,000, while the proportion utilised had stayed at
73 to 74 per cent.
On the Continent, utilisation had fallen because of the weakness in UK ferry
traffic from the Netherlands. In Germany, some custom had been lost because
of constraints on the fleet.
In general leasing, a profit fall in broking was offset by a doubling of
profit to Pounds 700,000 in the Mobiel subsidiary that supplies temporary
buildings. Mr Callear said Mobiel's market was mushrooming in the former
East Germany.
With the help of the rights issue, net debt, including leases and
convertible bonds, fell from Pounds 166m to Pounds 132m, while net assets
rose to Pounds 72.2m (Pounds 42.9m), halving gearing to 183 per cent.
Mr Callear said this was comfortable for a rental/leasing business.
Mr Jim Davis, chairman, said the group's emphasis had switched from chasing
market share to profitability.
On an increased tax rate of 23 (15) per cent, earnings per share rose to
2.58p (2.27p). The interim dividend, which was cut by two thirds last year,
is raised to 0.64p (0.56p).
A decision to sell the loss-making truck hire and distribution business led
to an extraordinary charge of Pounds 640,000.
COMMENT
The last thing TIP wanted after its rescue from near bankruptcy was a
deepening of the UK recession. Worries on that score had recently brought
the share price down to little more than the rights issue price of 40p.
These results have brought some relief through the elimination of losses in
UK trailer rental and evidence of decent cash flow. The group continues to
be run on a tight rein, with capital spending only growing to Pounds 20m
this year. For the future, if TIP - and its bigger rival Tiphook - can
continue to raise rates, the outlook for profitability gets much brighter.
With the help of a reduced interest charge, full-year pre-tax profit is
expected to rise to about Pounds 12m, giving a prospective multiple of less
than 7 on yesterday's close of 43p. Although still requiring some boldness,
it looks a classic recovery play.

FT  01 APR 92 / UK Company News: Johnston Press produces 8.5% rise to Pounds
7.6m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JOHNSTON PRESS, the Edinburgh-based company which publishes paid-for and
free newspapers in England and Scotland, increased pre-tax profit by 8.5 per
cent, from Pounds 6.74m to Pounds 7.6m, in 1991.
The rise was achieved despite a 2 per cent fall in sales to Pounds 61.9m,
and stemmed from cost control measures and the shedding of production staff
as a result of new technology.
Mr Fred Johnston, chairman, whose family controls 52 per cent of the shares,
said the newspapers had generally suffered a decline in advertising volumes.
Gains in Scotland, where recession had been less severe, was offset by falls
in the English newspapers.
Earnings were 18.7p (16.7p). The final dividend is 3.5p, making 5.5p (5p).

FT  01 APR 92 / UK Company News: European Motor calls for Pounds 17.4m in
rights
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPEAN MOTOR Holdings, the motor group launched out of Cargo Control last
autumn, is raising Pounds 17.4m in a rights issue and buying the car wash
equipment market leader.
The 4-for-3 issue of 17.4m shares at 105p each, will mostly be used to fund
the cash and shares acquisition of Casemount, parent company of Wilcomatic.
The deal consists of a Pounds 5.5m purchase price, in 3.59m shares and
Pounds 1.7m cash, plus the repayment of Pounds 12.9m debt. EMH's shares were
suspended last week at 123p.
Mr Richard Palmer, chief executive, said about Pounds 4m of the issue
proceeds would be left over to repay EMH's debt, leaving the combined group
ungeared on net assets of about Pounds 14.5m.
Wilcomatic's 2,200 machines carried out 52m car washes last year. Founded 25
years ago, it was the subject of a management buy-out via Casemount in 1989.
In the year to February 1 Casemount made an operating profit of Pounds 2.33m
on turnover of Pounds 15.2m.
It is EMH's second purchase in six months. Last October it bought Thomas
Robinson's motor dealership business for Pounds 7.1m, which was accompanied
by a share issue to raise Pounds 9.5m. Robinson was then under the care of a
company doctor and has since been taken over by BM Group, the industrial
holding group.
That deal marked the launch of EMH out of the ashes of Cargo Control, which
had suffered substantial losses at Transequip, its aircraft container
manufacturing subsidiary. Cargo's pre-tax losses amounted to Pounds 735,000
for the six months to September 30.
Mr Palmer, who built up Western Motors between 1987 and March 1990 when it
was sold for Pounds 100m to TKM, said: 'Most of last year was spent sorting
out the company and we sold Transequip, which was the most haemorrhaging
subsidiary.'
The combined group is forecast to have annual profits of just over Pounds 4m
on turnover of more than Pounds 80m.

FT  01 APR 92 / UK Company News: Croda at Pounds 21m but sees strong start
to year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CRODA International, the chemicals group, reported annual results broadly in
line with industry expectations after significant cost cutting in the face
of recession.
Pre-tax profits for 1991 fell from Pounds 33.7m to Pounds 21.3m on sales
down 4 per cent at Pounds 352.5m.
Earnings per share fell from 17.45p to 10.9p and a reduced final dividend of
4.75p gives a total for the year of 7.5p, down 32 per cent on 1990, in line
with the interim statement.
Mr Keith Hopkins, chief executive, said that sales in the first two months
of this year were 'well up' on comparable months last year as a result of
stronger demand for chemicals for the cosmetics and packaging industries.
Gearing was unchanged from the half-year at 39 per cent although the
interest charge nearly doubled to Pounds 6.1m as less interest was
capitalised. Capital expenditure, which at Pounds 16m last year represented
the end of a large investment programme, was likely to fall to Pounds 13m
this year.
Mr Hopkins said the group was concentrating on expanding foreign markets,
particularly in Europe and the US, as only 62 per cent of sales were
currently overseas, a relatively low level for the chemical industry.
COMMENT
Croda is closer to the consumer than most chemical companies, so it is not
surprising that its sighting of recovery has come before its competitors.
Having taken out significant costs this year, it is well positioned to take
advantage of the recovery. This, however, may be restricted by the higher
interest charge coming through now that the large capital spending programme
has been completed and less interest is being capitalised. While some
brokers are forecasting pre-tax profits close to Pounds 27m, a figure of
Pounds 25m seems more likely, giving earnings of 12.6p and a prospective
multiple of 13.

FT  01 APR 92 / UK Company News: BNB Resources tumbles to Pounds 2.6m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PROFITS AT BNB Resources, the recruitment, training and advertising group,
tumbled 40 per cent, from Pounds 4.5m to Pounds 2.6m pre-tax, in 1991 as the
recession put severe pressure on fees.
Mr David Norman, chairman, said the results were 'more than respectable'
against the 'worst trading conditions experienced in our industry sectors in
more than a decade'. UK demand for recruitment advertising and selection had
fallen by 40 per cent.
He warned that the first six months of this year would continue to be
difficult, but some growth was expected by the second half.
The result, struck on turnover 16 per cent lower at Pounds 54.9m, was buoyed
by interest gains of Pounds 1.3m (Pounds 1.9m). The group had Pounds 7.5m
cash after the Pounds 2.8m purchase of ATC, the chartered accountant
training company, at the end of the year.
Mr Norman said BNB 'may well spend the money on acquisitions' and suggested
that the next significant purchase was likely to be in the training sector.
The decline in profits masked a strong showing from the executive search
business, which increased its contribution by more than 20 per cent. Profits
in the human resources division overall fell by 19 per cent to Pounds 2.07m,
following a 33 per cent drop in advertising revenues. Further declines in
this division had been halted through a Pounds 100,000-plus restructuring
programme.
The regional communications business incurred a Pounds 45,000 loss (Pounds
399,000 profit), largely from a sharp decline in profits in Scotland. The
other two regional businesses, in Manchester and Birmingham, were expected
to return to profit this year following significant cost-cutting, said Mr
Norman. 'I think we have got the cost base right, but demand is static to
say the least,' he said.
Earnings per share fell by 6.2p to 8.3p. The final dividend is 3.3p for a
total of 4.9p (4.6p).

Mowat, the USM-quoted property and leisure group, yesterday reported a
pre-tax loss of Pounds 1.97m for the 15 months to end-September and also
revealed that it was holding talks regarding the sale of its housebuilding
division.
The loss, which compared with profits of Pounds 651,000 for the 12 months to
June 30 1990, was struck after taking account of a Pounds 5.7m rise in
administration expenses to Pounds 8.71m and interest charges which more than
doubled to Pounds 11.5m.
Turnover expanded from Pounds 26.6m to Pounds 48.8m and operating profits by
Pounds 3.4m to Pounds 9.5m. Leisure activities contributed Pounds 22.1m
(Pounds 4.16m) to turnover and Pounds 4m (Pounds 2m) to operating profits.
Mr Brian Dunlop, chairman, said the 'relative performances of the group's
main operating divisions have highlighted the strength of the holiday
division'.
As a result, it has decided to concentrate all group resources in the
holiday division and initiate a phased withdrawal from property development
and housebuilding.

Clinton Cards, the specialist high street greeting card retailer, showed a
loss of Pounds 163,000 for the year ended February as some recession-hit
customers stayed away from its stores. The result compared with a pre-tax
profit of Pounds 5m a year earlier.
Operating profits dropped to Pounds 600,000 (Pounds 5.8m) despite a 10 per
cent staff cut. Net interest charges of Pounds 740,000 pushed it into the
red.
The final dividend was cut to 2.25p a share making 3.75p (5.25p) total.
Losses per share totalled 0.96p (earnings 20.4p).
Turnover rose 17 per cent to Pounds 60.3m (Pounds 51.4m).

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
PROFITS of Macfarlane Group (Clansman), the Glasgow-based packaging company,
continued to fall through the second six months of 1991 and for the full
year emerged Pounds 2.37m lower at Pounds 6.85m pre-tax.
The figure was adversely affected by restructuring costs of Pounds 804,000
(Pounds 618,000) which were taken above the line this time following changes
in accounting standards - previously restructuring charges were taken below
the line.
With most group companies exposed to a downturn in business throughout the
year turnover fell by 19.4 per cent to Pounds 82.66m.
In order to counteract the effects of the recession the directors introduced
economies which included substantial reductions in manning levels, stocks
and debtors.
In order to reflect their confidence in the underlying strength of the
business the directors are proposing to raise the dividend for the year by
5.1 per cent to 4.24p via a final of 2.49p. Earnings fell from 11.91p to
8.97p per share.

FT  01 APR 92 / Hachette cuts its losses over La Cinq: The ending of a
French flirtation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN Mr Jean-Luc Lagardere posed, sun-tanned and smiling, for the French
press outside La Cinq's headquarters in October 1990, he was celebrating the
end of a lengthy struggle to take Hachette, his publishing and printing
group, into television.
The memory of those celebrations must seem, at best, bitter-sweet to
Hachette's chairman.
La Cinq, which earlier this year filed for bankruptcy, will on Friday be
told by a Paris court if it is to close. Hachette's flirtation with the
television industry has lasted less than 18 months and could cost up to
FFr3.55bn (Dollars 630m) (Pounds 360m).
It might also mean that Mr Lagardere and his family lose control of
Hachette, one of Europe's most prominent media empires.
The La Cinq crisis has come at the worst possible time for Hachette which is
burdened by heavy debts after its over-ambitious acquisitions in the US.
On Monday Hachette announced that, after totting up last year's losses on La
Cinq, it was asking its banks for a fresh injection of capital to
restructure its finances.
Hachette has to make provisions of up to FFr1.8bn for La Cinq in its 1991
accounts. This follows a provision of FFr1.7bn in 1990 bringing the total
bill for its brief investment in television to FFr3.55bn. But the 1991
provision takes Hachette's net debt to an estimated FFr8bn - against equity
of just FFr1.2bn.
It remains to be seen what form the financial restructuring will take: how
much money the banks, which include Credit Lyonnais and Banque Nationale de
Paris, will agree to give; and whether the Lagardere family interests can
hold on to their 51 per cent of Hachette.
Meanwhile Mr Lagardere is proceeding with the plan he announced to a
startled Paris stock market earlier this year, to merge Hachette with Matra,
the electronics company also controlled by the Lagardere family.
'The merger with Matra looks more and more like a rescue for Hachette,' said
one media analyst. 'The chickens are really coming home to roost at
Hachette. We will soon find out whether there are a few vultures among
them.'
Until the La Cinq debacle, Hachette was seen as an ambitious, but far from
reckless media group which was expanding beyond its original base in France
notably by launching Elle, its successful fashion magazine, into other
countries.
Mr Lagardere can hardly complain he was not warned about the pitfalls of
investing in television. No fewer than three government ministers told him
to steer clear of La Cinq which had been struggling to establish itself as
France's fifth channel since its launch in 1986.
But Mr Lagardere, still smarting at being beaten by the Bouygues
construction group in the 1987 privatisation bid for TF1, the biggest French
channel, was anxious to take Hachette into television. When the opportunity
arose to invest in La Cinq in autumn 1990, he leapt at it.
La Cinq had then already lost almost FFr2.5bn. Its losses have since
escalated. By late last year the situation was critical. On New Year's Eve
Hachette, having tried and failed to find new investors, announced the
station was filing for bankruptcy.
No one, not even Mr Lagardere, knows the final cost of La Cinq to Hachette.
It is still in negotiations over possible compensation for the investors,
notably Kleinwort Benson, the British bank, that it brought into the station
in 1990. But the putative provision of FFr1.8bn for 1991 is believed to be
the highest possible figure, enabling Hachette to begin 1992 with a clean
sheet.
La Cinq may be the immediate cause of Hachette's predicament, but it is not
the only problem. Hachette is also encumbered by the debts amassed in its
acquisitions of the late 1980s and by the difficulty of integrating its new
interests. It has been left with net debt of around FFr8bn mainly because of
the purchase of two US companies - Grolier encyclopedias and Diamandis
magazines - for a total of Dollars 1.16bn (Pounds 670m) in late 1988.
Unluckily for Hachette it did the deals on the eve of the US recession and
the consequent slump in the publishing sector.
The new acquisitions not only performed less well than Hachette had expected
(the US companies covered their financial costs for the first time in 1991),
but it was also hampered in its attempts to reduce its debts by making
disposals, not only in the US but in other countries.
Hachette did sell the Nouvelles Messageries building in central Paris for
FFr2.78bn in 1990 and sold some printing businesses last year. But its 8.1
per cent stake in Rizzoli, the Italian publisher, is still on the block as
is its landmark building on Paris' Boulevard Saint Germain.
'This is a very bad time to be making disposals,' said Mr Jean Jacques
Limage, media analyst at James Capel in Paris. 'The publishing and property
markets are both depressed. Hachette is finding it difficult to get good
prices.'
It is difficult to calculate the full impact of these problems on Hachette
given it has had little contact with analysts for the past year. However
Hachette posted a net loss of FFr30m in the first half of 1991 and is
expected to report another loss, possibly as high as FFr1bn, for the full
year in its results next month.
In the meantime Hachette, like the rest of the French media, is waiting
anxiously for Friday when a Paris court decides whether to pull the plug on
La Cinq. If it does, a blank screen will take the place of France's
ill-fated fifth channel.

FT  01 APR 92 / Stoltenberg exit a blow to Kohl: German defence minister
resigns after row over arms supplies to Turkey
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR HELMUT KOHL, the German chancellor, was struggling yesterday to limit the
political damage to his government and party from the abrupt resignation of
Mr Gerhard Stoltenberg, his defence minister, in a row over arms supplies to
Turkey.
He announced the immediate appointment of Mr Volker Ruhe, the 49-year-old
secretary-general of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU), to succeed Mr
Stoltenberg, the longest-serving and most senior member of the government.
Like Mr Stoltenberg, Mr Ruhe is a northerner and a Protestant, and a staunch
supporter of Nato, as well as a confidant of the chancellor and a rising
star in the ruling party.
The resignation of the defence minister could scarcely have come at a worse
moment in domestic political terms, because Mr Stoltenberg is the honorary
chairman and father-figure of the CDU in Schleswig-Holstein, the northern
state where elections are being held for a new government on Sunday. A key
reason for his rapid departure from the government was an attempt to limit
the electoral damage.
Mr Stoltenberg announced his decision at a joint press conference with
Chancellor Kohl, after insisting on Monday that he did not intend to quit.
In doing so, he was taking political responsibility for the delivery last
year of 15 Leopard-1 tanks to Turkey, after the German parliament had
ordered an embargo because of Turkish military actions against the Kurds.
The row blew up after Germany protested to Turkey at the use of German
armoured cars in new operations against Kurdish guerrillas - leading to a
furious slanging match with the Turkish government, traditionally a close
ally inside the Nato alliance.
Only after Germany announced the renewed suspension of arms supplies -
Turkey has a contract for 150 Leopard tanks, as well as equipment from the
former East German army - did it emerge that the 15 tanks had been delivered
in November in defiance of the parliamentary embargo.
On Monday Mr Stoltenberg announced the early retirement of the senior
defence ministry official responsible, but yesterday, in response to a
univers-ally hostile press and the advice of close political colleagues, he
decided to quit himself.
He said he had not changed his assessment of responsibility for the delivery
of the tanks, 'but the judgment and perceptions in a broad spectrum of
public opinion are different. In addition there could be complications in
the election campaigns in Schleswig-Holstein and Baden-Wurttemberg.
'I want to avoid damage for both the CDU and the federal government with my
decision.'
Mr Kohl said he was prepared to back Mr Stoltenberg in whatever decision he
took, although political observers in Bonn are convinced that the defence
minister came under heavy party pressure to step down.
Mr Ruhe has a reputation as a tough political in-fighter, and a wide range
of international contacts, especially in London and Washington.

<TEXT>
Sir, Is it not possible finally to dispel the mythology of National Health
Service deficit funding?
From 1946, through Bevan as minister of health, the Labour government
implemented the report on Social Insurance &amp; Allied Services by W H
Beveridge, Cmnd 6404 1942. In paragraph 27, the post-war inflation rate was
determined at plus 25 per cent on 1938 prices. The actual increase was made
at 31 per cent (held at the cost of living above pre-war).
The Beveridge increase was based on the 1914 Cost of Living Index, long
outdated, and replaced in 1946. The subsequent Treasury review showed that,
using the old 1914 index, 1946 prices were 54 per cent above pre-war.
Ignoring the new (1946) index, the deficit has always been minus 23 per
cent. John Booth,

FT  01 APR 92 / Foreign Affairs: Islam and integration - Western societies
are divided over their relationship with their Moslem communities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD MORTIMER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
No one seems to know exactly how many Moslems there are in Britain. Probably
not more than 1m, but they are unevenly spread. In Birmingham, they make up
10 per cent of the population. Yet even Birmingham will not have a single
Moslem MP in the next parliament. No political party in this election has
adopted a Moslem candidate for a winnable seat.
Stop, stop. Don't turn the page. This is indeed the Foreign Affairs column.
But the subject of Moslem communities in western countries is, par
excellence, one where foreign and domestic affairs overlap. This became
clear over last weekend during a fascinating conference on the subject at
Ditchley Park, the international affairs seminar centre.
The existence of such communities is a relatively recent phenomenon, going
back only a generation or so. Their members, even when born in and citizens
of their present country of residence, are still generally perceived by the
rest of the population as 'immigrants'. Moreover, they belong, for the most
part, to ethnic groups which are easily distinguishable from the majority
population by their physical appearance. One of the unresolved questions is
whether they should not be classified as ethnic or religious minorities. It
was argued, especially by French participants, that to insist on their
Moslem character tends to reinforce their ethnic separateness - to force
them into a ghetto - by superimposing on them a largely artificial religious
identity.
Only 6 per cent of Arabs in France, it was claimed, regularly attend
mosques. If asked, they will no doubt identify themselves as Moslems, but
they should not be asked. In fact, the French census carefully avoids asking
such questions. One French specialist even asserted that in order to
integrate these people into French society, it was necessary to
'disintegrate' their separate communal identities. They should be treated
just as Jews were in the French Revolution, according to the formula of
Clermont-Tonnerre: 'All rights for the Jews as individuals, nothing for them
as a nation.'
One might think that an individual schoolgirl would have the right to wear a
headscarf at school if she (or her parents) so chose. Not so. This, we
learned, was not an individual gesture. It was a deliberate challenge to the
authorities by an organised group seeking to claim leadership of the
'Moslem' community and to oblige the state to negotiate with it. Had one
girl been allowed to wear the headscarf, others would have followed the
fashion, and it would have become a badge of ethnic identity, marking off
the Moslems from their fellow citizens. As it was, the state stood firm and
the mass of the Arab population accepted its decision.
There spoke la republique une et indivisible. We Anglo-Saxons listened, and
gulped. Most of us felt that, for once, we had managed this matter better in
England. Here, after all, we have never fully separated religion from the
state. We have an established church, which once aspired, in the days of the
17th-century theologian Richard Hooker, to include 'every man that is of the
common weal', but which long since came to terms with the fact that it has
to co-exist with other religious communities and to share with them, even if
unequally and grudgingly, the goods that the state has to offer. Thus there
is no absolute distinction between church schools and state schools. They
overlap in the category of 'voluntary aided schools', which have an explicit
denominational character, yet are financed almost entirely from public
funds. Most are Anglican, but Roman Catholic, Methodist and even Jewish ones
can be found.
So why not Moslem ones? Faced with this question, the English consensus
quickly broke up. Some of us began to think the French had a point after
all. Remembering the divisive effects of separate denominational schools in
Northern Ireland, we shrank from encouraging Moslems to educate their
children separately. We even wondered about their reasons for wishing to do
so. Was it not to maintain the control of men over women, and of
self-proclaimed religious leaders over 'the community' as a whole? Certainly
they were entitled to equal treatment but perhaps, in the name of equality,
it would be better to do away with church schools, or at least to force them
into the private sector. (The French, we were told, had been prepared in the
name of equality to forbid Jewish boys to wear skullcaps at school, although
previously this had not been an issue.) Let the state school be a
melting-pot a l'americaine, in which different cultures can be fused into
something uniquely and splendidly British.
At this point, however, our American colleagues deserted us. The
melting-pot, they said, had long since been abandoned. Different cultures
should not be forcibly merged, but cherished as something that 'enriched' a
pluralist society. Admittedly, church and state are legally separate in the
US, and therefore there are no state-funded church schools. But at one time
there had been a serious question whether Catholic schools, in which a
doctrine then seen as hostile to democracy would be taught, should be
allowed in America at all. In the end they had been, and had proved to be, a
great civilising and democratising influence. If Britain wished to integrate
its Moslem citizens, it should show similar confidence, allowing them to
take charge of their own children's education provided they accepted the
national curriculum and educational standards set by the state.
On the whole I was convinced by this argument. We are unlikely to achieve a
real convivencia between Moslems and non-Moslems if we continue to describe
Islam as a problem. Of course, Moslems do have problems, and not all of them
are of the west's making (although some are). Moslems have a lot of work to
do in interpreting their own religion and applying it to the life of a
modern democratic society in which the majority of their fellow citizens
follow other faiths or none. They are certainly not helped by being
associated, in the minds of those fellow citizens, with unpleasant foreign
regimes which issue death sentences against British novelists, or with
groups which blow up aircraft and take hostages.
Such events arise either from disputes among Moslems or as a reaction to
western interventions in the Islamic world, but non-Moslems tend to see them
as part of a grand Islamic design to attack the west. There is no such
design, nor even any Islamic leadership capable of conceiving one. The
Moslem community is already quite sufficiently disintegrated, in fact too
much so. Greater integration among Moslems could help rather than hinder
their integration into a pluralist western society.
Western states will not achieve that by identifying or imposing a religious
leadership and making it responsible for the Moslem community, as was the
practice of some Moslem states in the past when dealing with non-Moslem
minorities. But political parties and other institutions might help if they
made a greater effort to involve individual Moslems, and promote them to
positions of responsibility. Young Moslem activists in Britain, we were
told, felt 'empowered' by Ayatollah Khomeini's fatwa against Salman Rushdie
because for the first time it forced British society to pay attention to
their views. There must be better ways for Moslems to win attention and a
share of power than that.

FT  01 APR 92 / Letter: Many in US fear the prospect of trade 'free riders'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Ms MARGARET S WIGGLESWORTH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your recent coverage of US initiatives in the Gatt services
negotiations has left many of us here in America wondering aloud whether our
years of vocal support for liberalised trade have been heard.
The US service sector remains a steadfast supporter of the Uruguay Round
negotiations, and has never waivered from its goal of a strong multilateral
agreement that assures markets will be open for service providers to compete
on a fair and equitable basis.
Under the structure of the services agreement contained in the so-called
draft 'Final Act', the degree to which it assures open markets depends on
the commitments inscribed in the contracting parties' schedules. The
services agreement, unlike the Gatt itself, does not assure national
treatment or end quantitative restrictions, and does not even presume that
foreign providers have a right to compete in other markets. Market access
commitments offered by individual countries are the only means of securing
these and other trade liberalising results.
Compared with the markets of many other countries, the US is largely open
for business. Commitments to match our openness in services have not been
forthcoming, and we are faced with the prospect of what is referred to here
as a 'free rider' problem. Free riders are countries which would enjoy the
benefits of an open US market, but make little or no commitment to open
their own markets. Under these conditions, unless the US removes some
sectors from the unconditional Most Favoured Nation obligation that forms
the basis of trading relationships under the Gatt, the final General
Agreement on Trade in Services, or Gats, will perpetuate that inequity.
The US list of MFN exemptions has proved too tempting a target for other
country negotiators who would seek to shift the blame for stalling the talks
to the US. In fact, the US exemption list is a surprise to no one, and
represents only our government's response should no commitments be
forthcoming.
The US private service sector will continue to push for market access
commitments from our trading partners. We want liberalised trade, and we
would welcome market access negotiations to reduce the list of exemptions.
But we cannot and will not support a Gats agreement that fails to achieve
real market access. It would serve neither the interests of the global
trading system, nor those of US business.

FT  01 APR 92 / Letter: FT-SE 100 will remain UK-based
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr PETER JONES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The impending floatation of GPA Group has publicly raised the issue of
whether Irish Republic companies should be included in the FT-SE 100 Index.
The Index Steering Committee (which was set up by the London Stock Exchange
as an independent body comprised of investment practitioners to oversee the
running of the FT-SE 100), recently confirmed long-standing practice that
the rules should continue specifically to exclude non-UK companies; so Irish
companies such as GPA Group, Jefferson Smurfit and Allied Irish Banks will
not be included in the index.
The principle rule being questioned by Irish companies is that the FT-SE 100
should consist only of 'companies incorporated and registered for tax
purposes in the UK'. The Irish companies' intention is clear - they wish to
improve the marketability and value of their shares and believe that entry
to the FT-SE 100 will achieve this.
Yet the FT-SE 100 was specifically, and very deliberately, designed to be an
indicator of the performance of the UK market. The change of rules needed to
to allow non-UK companies to enter the index - whether Irish, American or
Japanese - would be a fundamental change to the design of the index.
The FT-SE 100 measures the performance of the UK's largest 100 companies and
is widely used by portfolio managers worldwide in measuring the performance
of their UK assets and in managing their portfolio risks using futures and
traded options on the index. It is not the only UK index - it is widely used
in conjunction with the FT-A All Share Index which represents the
performance of a larger proportion of the UK market. Both indices are
focused on the UK market and neither index includes Irish companies.
Neither index does so because they are used by portfolio managers to monitor
their UK sterling denominated funds. Portfolio managers do not include Irish
companies in their UK funds and they will not slavishly follow the decisions
of the steering committee in deciding which stocks to hold in such
portfolios. Most institutional users of the FT-SE 100 are not passive index
trackers but are either active fund managers focused on the largest UK
securities or are trackers of the wider based FT-A All Share Index.
What use is the FT-SE 100 with overseas additions (Irish or any other) to a
portfolio manager wishing to measure the performance of the largest
companies within his UK fund or who wishes to use the FT-SE 100 futures and
options to hedge his UK position?
All other major indices make a clear distinction between UK and Irish
companies - even so far as to group Irish companies with continental Europe
rather than the UK when calculating the performance of the two major blocs
within Europe; namely, UK and Europe excluding UK.
While the committee understands the motives and the intentions of Irish
companies wishing to be included in the FT-SE 100, it has no intention of
turning the FT-SE 100 into a UK index with selected international additions.

FT  01 APR 92 / Leading Article: Weakness at the Tory heart
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH BUSINESS over-whelmingly desires an outright Conservative victory in
next week's general election. As a consequence, there is growing dismay at
the quality of the effort being directed to achieve that end.
On paper, the Conservatives can comfort themselves that until last night
they were on average only a couple of percentage points behind in the
opinion polls. It may yet be that, in the privacy of the marginal seat
polling booth, the combined alarm at Labour's personal tax plans and fear of
the unknown will save Mr Major from eviction.
Yet when the campaign began three weary weeks ago, the Conservatives had
every reason to think they could overhaul a party committed to tax increases
and with a leader whose personal rating has oscillated between the cool and
the downright hostile. Mr Major, by contrast, remains a well-liked, trusted
figure. What has gone wrong?
The campaign, to put it mildly, has lacked focus. Was Mr Major to be a
bar-stool crooner or a soap-box firebrand? Both continue to be tried. Was
Mrs Thatcher in exile from the campaign or at its heart? She began on the
edge, moved to the centre and is now in America.
What is Mr Michael Heseltine up to? Before the election he was made minister
of everyone else's portfolio. He has yet to make an impact on the campaign.
Other dogs of war have been unleashed, only to slink back to their kennels.
Mr Christopher Patten, the party chairman, spends half his time fighting his
own marginal seat in Bath and is therefore dependent upon mobile phone and
fax contact with his inexperienced team at central office. On the rare
occasions when the also permanently itinerant Mr Major and Mr Patten sit
down to think, their fatigue can only be guessed at. Frankly, the Tory front
bench looks exhausted.
Endless confusion
There has also been endless confusion about the desired terrain of the Tory
campaign. Initially, the focus was tax and Mr Major. After Labour's shadow
budget, it became obvious that Mr Lamont was no campaigning match for his
shadow, Mr John Smith, and the Tories slipped back in the polls.
Then came the diversion caused by Labour's mishandling of its health
campaign, which ironically led to a modest narrowing of the Labour lead. How
did central office respond to that? By relaunching the week-one tax theme,
with the same tired advertising, thus bringing Mr Smith back into the
spotlight, since when he has cruised up and down the River Thames shelling
unfortified Tory positions at will.
Journalists have been briefed that the Tory campaign would become more
aggressive towards Labour - more 'negative'; then that it would be more
positive. If household appliances were wired in this manner the whole of
central office would have been electrocuted by now.
Unpunished mistakes
Meanwhile Labour has been allowed to make unpunished mistake after mistake.
Most obviously, the Tories' response to Labour's unscrupulous health
broadcast was fluffed, but every day brings new errors. The prime minister
promises annual tax cuts. The chancellor says Britain can't afford them. Mr
Kinnock virtually pledges to index public sector pay to private sector
wages; central office manages, just, a fax to the press by teatime.
Labour's own campaign has been tight rather than brilliant. It has benefited
from a single sustained message - 'it's time for Labour'  - and unshakeably
solid salesmanship from Mr Smith. Mr Kinnock is mainly seen parading
grandly, but when he has emerged for big television interviews, he has done
well, handling hard questions on the economy and public finances with a
suavity many thought beyond his capability.
Mr Major now has a mountain to climb and looks short of oxygen bottles. As
he gathers his advisers for a last, desperate attempt at the peak, he will
need more than a new advertising agency and a good night's sleep.
He needs to decide, in a way which his manifesto failed to do, whether he
stands for softly spoken Thatcherism or something identifiably different.
Although a popular man, his campaign has exposed to the British public his
party's identity crisis. This is not just a matter of presentation: it is
the weakness at the heart of the Tory campaign.

By today perhaps the election campaign will have moved from childish
bickering to some of the important issues: Europe, for instance. Britain is
facing its most significant constitutional change in centuries, yet scarcely
a word has been said in this campaign, presumably because all three parties
support the same pro-European policy. In any event, Dispatches is
investigating the subject tonight (9.00 C4). Among those taking part is Lord
Rees-Mogg, who says that we set out to get free-trade and co-operation in
Europe but the process has been hijacked by a very powerful group which is
trying to create a federal Europe.
If you cannot face another word about politics, perhaps you will want to
watch Goldfinger again (8.00 ITV). It is, after all, one of the best of the
Bond movies, those big expensive spoofs which took the gimmicks of modern
technology and, after trying them out, blew them up spectacularly. Sean
Connery stars and Shirley Eaton is the one painted gold all over.

FT  01 APR 92 / Arts: The Wallace Collection - Music in London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY

<TEXT>
John Wallace is a cheerful Scot who plays the classical trumpet. He has been
a Philharmonia principal for years, but also runs a sort of brass
sewing-group, neatly called the 'Wallace Collection', and with them or solo
he hunts up new music. In the Queen Elizabeth Hall on Monday, the group got
together with the Philharmonia itself for a bracing programme.
The first half was doubly perverse. Not only did it begin with Britten's
all-strings Simple Symphony arranged for chortling brass and percussion (by
Colin Matthews and Simon Wright), and a Gabrieli Sonata for five
mixed-instrument choirs suavely arranged for 23 strings (by Wallace), but it
required two long, fascinating ballets of stagehands to rearrange the
seating for the different performing forces.
The third work, Michael Torke's Copper with concertante brass quintet - a
European premiere - showed Torke in typically buoyant form. Which is to say,
not quite typical: nearly every piece by this young American composer slips
a new device or two into his shiny but austere post-minimalist kit.
In Copper there were vinegary new modulations, more intriguingly disruptive
than before, and much off-beat interplay between quintet (heavy brass: two
trumpets, horn, trombone and tuba) and orchestra. Also dewy Impressionist
linkages from the strings, and shamelessly naff paragraph-ends by carolling
woodwinds; and the usual Torke effect of tough musical muscle rippling
beneath that slick surface.
The muscle was what was missing in Tim Souster's 1988 Concerto for trumpet,
live electronics and orchestra. That boasted a rich, eclectic panoply of
sounds, with Hollywood-evocative aims confirmed by the taped wave-noises in
its central 'Beach' movement (Dover Beach, as in Matthew Arnold), without
any guiding musical idea.
Though Wallace delivered his broken phrases in the first two movements with
searching eloquence, the final 'Dawn' movement resorted to the merest
Technicolor. Souster is an admirably unclassifiable composer, but he should
leave this kind of thing to David Bedford, who does it with far greater
conviction.

FT  01 APR 92 / Arts: The Chalk Garden
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD

<TEXT>
Here is a bold revival, especially for this theatre. Enid Bagnold's The
Chalk Garden was written in 1956, almost at the same time as John Osborne
was writing about Jimmy Porter and the English stage was putting the old
upper middle class traditions behind it.
Ms Bagnold, as I suppose we would call her now, though she was in fact Lady
Jones, the wife of the chairman of Reuters, belonged firmly to the old
school of plot, characters, servants and masters, an element of suspense,
some symbolism, no swearing and a few witty lines of dialogue. She was
different from what came after.
Or was she? Watching The Chalk Garden I had an uneasy sense of continuity.
The play reminds you of Terence Rattigan, whom the King's Head has also had
a shot at reviving. But, in technique, it is not so far apart from Look Back
in Anger. It is the social attitudes and the language that have changed.
In the Bagnold world it was possible to talk about Aden without guilt and
without even mentioning - remember 1956 was the year of Suez  - that it was
a British colony. There were miscarriages of justice by eminent judges:
people went mad, couldn't stand their mother, abandoned their children and
went off with lovers. But they referred these matters in an articulate way,
sometimes even in front of the servants.
The Chalk Garden is a bit heavy on symbolism. Essentially it is that some
plants grow on chalk and some do not. 'Whoever tried to grow rhododendrons
in a chalk garden? Soil cannot give what it has not got.' says Miss
Madrigal, the possible murderess who has served 15 years in prison for a
crime we do know if she has committed, or even wholly what it was. And so it
goes for people: they need the right environment (not, incidentally, a word
much used in the Bagnold vocabulary).
Maitland, the manservant, has been in prison too - for being a conscientious
objector. He and the abandoned daughter are fascinated by murders, but so
not so much the crime itself as the motivation behind it.
In the end it all ends happily enough, though not without a final lump in
the throat. The old judge who sentenced Miss Madrigal comes to lunch, the
mother returns from the Middle East to pick up her daughter who has been
loosely in Miss Madrigal's charge and Miss Madrigal decides to stay with the
grandmother determined to grow unexpected plants on chalk.
Sentimental perhaps, but dated only in the sense that it belongs to a
period. As a vehicle for acting, it is superb. Robert Austin is a marvellous
Maitland, Constance Cummings plays the eccentric grandmother in the
tradition of the best of English grandes dames and Jean Marsh is full of
fluttering feeling as Miss Madrigal.
Everyone shines and the piece is directed by Mark Rayment.

FT  01 APR 92 / Arts: Quality and popularity - Television
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER DUNKLEY

<TEXT>
On Sunday, BBC2 showed an excellent 'Screen Two' called The Last Romantics
in which writer Nigel Williams and director Jack Gold managed the difficult
trick of combining a play of ideas (the old and new theories of literary
criticism as represented by Quiller-Couch and the Leavises) with a
conventional drama of personalities in which a young political activist
challenged FR Leavis with much the same cruelty, though less of the
intellectual impact, that Leavis himself had used early in his career when
he challenged 'Q'. The irony was that Leavis (played by Ian Holm) ended up
feeling defensive about his old adversary while his frightening wife,
Queenie (one of the best performances I have seen from Sara Kestelman, who
gets better and better) became more vituperative than ever about Q and the
old school.
It was a subtle and engrossing work in which the seemingly rarified matter
of literary criticism was shown to be central to the lives of those
involved. No drama could convey the whole of the Q-Leavis-CP Snow debate
about culture which occurred in Cambridge between the 1920s and 1960s
without becoming didactic or absurd, but this production went a remarkable
distance quite safely down that road.
Towards the end, Q (Leo McKern) said to Leavis: 'The issue is whether we
share a culture, isn't it, and I have only to look out of my window to know
the answer. Just over that wall, even in Cambridge, there are ordinary
people, and I cannot believe that they see things much differently than they
did in Shakespeare's day, or that they are so very different from you and
me, or that they can't be expected to understand poetry'.
At which point Leavis said: 'They inhabit a different world'. Q responded:
'If I really thought that was the case how could I stand upon my hind legs
and talk about something called literature? Because if literature is in as
bad a way as you make it sound, it is little more than a private language,
and you know what happens to private languages: they grow stale, they die,
and they are for gotten'.
I quote at length because it seems to go to the heart of a debate which has
been proceeding since last October when Michael Ignatieff interviewed David
Hare on The Late Show about his play Murmuring Judges and led Hare into a
discussion about 'relativism' (though the word was not mentioned): the
question of whether, since the 1960s, there have been any widely accepted
standards left in the arts in Britain. Hare asserted that, contrary to views
which supposedly became popular in the 60s, especially on television, Keats
is a better poet than Bob Dylan.
Hare's main points seemed to be that the people involved in television arts
programmes, especially programmes like The Late Show, treated the arts in an
indiscriminate and amoral way, and encouraged destructive criticism from
people who had themselves never created anything of value. That second
argument was settled by Dr Johnson 200 years ago when he responded to
Boswell's breast-beating about some earlier criticism of a play by Mallet
('How vain should either of us be to write one not near so good') with: 'You
may scold a carpenter who has made you a bad table, though you cannot make a
table. It is not your trade to make tables'.
However, the first part of the argument has continued within The Late Show
and on various arts pages, especially in the Guardian, where Patrick Wright
summarised the new approach as 'carrying out elaborate cultural studies on
the everyday world, decoding advertisements and drawing up lifestyle audits
on each other'. The debate is scarcely new, of course. There have always
been those who looked on programmes such as the famous edition of Arena on
the Ford Cortina as a surrender to philistine values.
No doubt the defenders of the old faith will have despised Arena's two most
recent programmes, on Chi-Chi, the famous panda in London Zoo, and on the
fiction of Armistead Maupin, the gay writer whose column 'Tales Of The City'
became such a hit in the San Francisco Chronicle. Above all they will have
loathed last week's edition of 40 Minutes called 'Farewell Fab 208', which
offered a showerbath of nostalgic sights and sounds for those who grew up
with Radio Luxembourg, 'Your station of the stars'. I found all three
fascinating, and informative.
Many people, probably a majority of the regular readers of this page, would
argue that the value of Radio Luxembourg to society is a tiny fraction of
the value of, say, the Royal Opera House, because the experience of
listening to, say, Placido Domingo singing 'Your tiny hand is frozen' is
vastly superior to that of listening to Max Bygraves singing 'You need
hands'.
With that particular comparison, who could disagree? But you do, surely,
have to be very particular: what about Frank Sinatra at the peak of his
career singing Cole Porter, as compared with one of our many lesser tenors
singing in one of Covent Garden's flops? Even Hare admitted to Ignatieff
that Raymond Chandler is a better writer than many of those who, in his day
at Cambridge, were required reading.
I suspect that what is happening here is that, for the first time in
history, there is a universally available means of mass communication
(television) which is able and willing to investigate and celebrate popular
art before history has had time to sort out good from bad. Even the
rigorously elitist Leavis in his best book, The Great Tradition,
acknowledged the quality and value of Dickens' Hard Times, and how did that
first reach the public? As weekly episodes in Household Words, its
appearance more than doubling the magazine's circulation. In other words it
was the soap opera of its day, appearing in the populist medium of its day.
It is hard to avoid the feeling that the debate now advancing under the
impressive device 'relativism' is actually just a variation on the familiar
snobbish attitude towards television among the British intelligentsia, and
it is not hard to see why. If you work in the theatre what can you hold up
in your own medium, from the past five or six years, which bears comparison
with Edge Of Darkness, The Singing Detective, A Very Peculiar Practice,
Tutti Frutti or Talking Heads? (And that ignores adaptations). Even more to
the point, what can the theatre produce to compare with Minder? Naturally
the standard has varied, but at its best Minder can easily bear comparison
with Dickens, and its audience is even larger than his was.
Obviously a book, theatre production or programme is not good merely because
it is popular, as anybody with a minimum of judgment and taste can tell by
looking at a Mills &amp; Boon paperback, The Mousetrap (not long ago I checked:
it is appalling) or any edition of Neighbours.
More importantly, however, anyone who looks at Amis's novels, Ayckbourn's
plays, and a host of television programmes from Attenborough's to Alan
Bennett's can also establish that a book, theatre production or programme is
not bad merely because it is popular, and that is the point which those
marching under the 'relativism' banner seem to find so very hard to accept.

FT  01 APR 92 / Business and the Environment: Industry turns over a new leaf
 -British companies faces tougher pollution laws from today
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN HUNT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UK government's ambitious attempt to bring the environmental clean-up of
industry under one umbrella by a system of integrated pollution control
(IPC) has just come to the end of its first year. Today marks the start of
the five-year plan's second stage.
To prevent or minimise environmental damage the volume of pollutants emitted
from a plant has to be authorised by Her Majesty's Inspectorate of
Pollution. HMIP has the difficult task of policing the regime introduced by
the 1990 Environmental Protection Act.
New or substantially altered processes came under the regime last April.
Existing processes are being brought in under a timetable stretching from
last April to 1996. About 5,000 large companies are affected in total.
Industry has complained repeatedly about the time and cost of getting
operations approved under the new system, and about the difficulty in
getting quick advice from HMIP. The inspectors maintain, however, that
industry often has itself to blame for any delays as many companies produced
insufficient data in their applications.
Diane Brown, environmental executive at the Chemical Industries Association
(CIA), says that HMIP is 'trying hard' but progress has been very slow.
'There was not sufficient time allowed to make all the preparations,' she
says. 'The politicians wanted the system introduced quickly - so quickly it
was.'
John Cridland, director of environment for the Confederation of British
Industry, estimates that it takes an average of 30 days for companies to
fill in the application forms for authorisation, which run to 30 pages of
questions. The rise in the costs of complying with the regulations has
brought protests from the CBI and the CIA.
For the coming year, the cost of authorisation doubles from Pounds 1,800 to
Pounds 3,650 and the annual fee to cover inspection triples from Pounds 500
to Pounds 1,500. These are levied on individual processes so a company might
have to pay a much larger total sum to authorise an entire plant.
Industry has been worried about public access to the information it provides
to get authorisation. The act says that the information has to appear on
public registers but it can be withheld on the grounds of commercial
confidentiality if a company can prove it would be disadvantaged by
disclosure.
The two large power companies, National Power and PowerGen, have not been
brought under the new regime. They objected that publication of the mix of
fuel they use would provide confidential information to their competitors.
HMIP rejected this and the companies appealed under the procedure laid down
in the Environmental Protection Act. A verdict on the appeal is awaited from
Michael Heseltine, environment secretary.
Teething troubles were inevitable but many of the problems are now being
ironed out. An example is the way the system has been adapted to meet the
complaints from the specialty chemical industry.
Companies in this sector make a wide range of products in a swiftly changing
and competitive market. If each process had to be authorised every time a
new order was received the cost and time consumed could drive them out of
business. After consultation the inspectorate has produced a system whereby
similar processes are combined in one 'envelope' which is given a single
authorisation.
The heart of the regime is the rule that companies must apply the 'best
available technique not entailing excessive cost' (Batneec) in controlling
pollution. Some companies have had difficulty finding out what this means in
practice and fear that it will prove costly to introduce.
But David Slater, director of HMIP, says it need not be a problem.
Multinational companies can often demonstrate the best techniques available
and this provides a benchmark for others. 'The keynote is practicability. We
don't want to put industries out of business. We want them to stay in
business and clean up.'

American Airlines has moved its international headquarters from the US to
London and appointed Hans Mirka, a 28-year airline industry veteran, to run
its expanding international operations.
Mirka becomes senior vice president international and will oversee all the
airline's passenger and cargo sales and services in Europe, the Pacific, the
Middle East, south east Asia and Africa from the new international
headquarters. European operations include those it took over from TWA's
North Atlantic routes.
Mirka, who had been in charge of American Airlines' international operations
at Dallas for the past three years, will be the highest ranking manager in
the US airline industry to be based in Europe.
Born in Estonia, Mirka began his career at American Airlines in 1964. After
serving as market development manager in New York, he left to join Finnair
as its sales manager for North America. In 1971, he returned to American
Airlines and helped launch its first European service from Dallas to
Gatwick. He also worked for Continental and PanAm before returning to
American in 1989.
*****
British Aerospace has, for its part, appointed a new chairman for its North
American subsidiary responsible for both North and South America. Robert
Kirk, the chairman of CSX, the US transport group, is replacing Brian Thomas
at the head of BAe's American operations. He will continue as chairman of
CSX.
Kirk was appointed a non-executive director of BAe last year becoming the UK
company's first non-British director. The appointment was part of BAe's
efforts to strengthen its board after the fiasco of its controversial rights
issue last autumn and the resignation of Professor Sir Roland Smith as
chairman of BAe.
*****
Air UK, the Stansted-based airline, has appointed Marcelle Speller to its
board as marketing director. Speller was previously vice president strategic
planning with American Express Travel Related Services for the UK and
Ireland.
She is also a former vice president marketing for Europe and the Middle East
for Inter-Continental Hotels and has worked for Avis and Heineken Breweries.
Her appointment at Air UK coincides with an intensification of competition
in the European air transport industry as a result of the European
Commission's airline liberalisation policy and the development of a single
European air transport market.
*****
Cathay Pacific has replaced John Olsen, its previous general manager for
Europe who left to become chief executive of Dan Air's parent, Davies &amp;
Newman Holdings, with Tony Tyler, who arrives from head office in Hong Kong.
Tyler, 36, joined Cathay Pacific parent John Swire in 1977, moving to the
airline a year later. More recently he was manager of Italy and France where
he was responsible for setting up new routes to Hong Kong from Paris and
Rome. He has also worked on the service from America and Japan. Since 1988
he has been general staff manager looking after all aspects of group
personnel policy. He will be based in London, developing capacity and
frequency of the European routes.

FT  01 APR 92 / People: Economist's mind tuned to predictable disasters
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Geoffrey Dennis, the new director of international operations at the British
Red Cross from today, had 'always had it at the back of the mind' that he
wanted to work - at a relatively senior level  - for charity.
An economist by training, Dennis, who is 40, joins from engineering
consultants Travers Morgan, where he looked after the planning division of
its environmental side. There, and with his previous employers Ewbank
Preece, he has managed a series of projects in the developing world -
spending a lot of time in Bang-ladesh, but also India and the Far East,
particularly Indonesia.
He says the fact that Travers was recently bought by Huntingdon, the
engineering and environmental services group, had nothing to do with his
decision to move to the charity - he had had interviews before he was aware
of the Huntingdon offer, and adds that his area was anyway one of Travers'
successes.
His new responsibilities encompass disaster relief, 'still the highest
priority' - for instance, tracing split Yugoslav families; and, a
rel-atively new departure, up-front development work to help lessen the
effect of predictable disasters, for example, providing hurricane shelters
in Bangladesh.
In a disaster-ridden 12 months, the British Red Cross last year spent Pounds
29.6m overseas.
Attracted by the 'young and dynamic' senior management - headed by director
general Mike Whitlam, 45, - Dennis says the pay cut he has taken is not as
significant as it would have been a decade ago, as charities have
increasingly woken up to the need to attract 'strong professional people'.
He replaces David Wyatt who retires after seven years in the job.

FT  01 APR 92 / Business and the Environment: Gaping holes in the safety net
 -Last week's radiation leak in Russia could have occurred at dozens of
sites in eastern Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW FISHER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
They represent one of the grimmest legacies of the old Soviet empire, but it
took a radiation leak near St Petersburg last week to refocus public
attention on the primitive safety standards in eastern Europe's nuclear
power stations.
The incident took place at Sosnovy Bor, one of the 16 Chernobyl-type nuclear
plants which most international experts relegate to the category of those
beyond hope. But there are many other reactors which western power plant
builders feel could be upgraded, and the sooner the better.
Because of their fundamental design flaws, there is broad agreement that
safety standards at the Chernobyl-type (RBMK) reactors cannot be improved
except at enormous cost. 'The only answer is to shut them down as soon as
possible. What happened at Sosnovy Bor confirmed that,' says Adolf Huttl,
head of the KWU power generation group of Siemens, the German company which
is one of the world's biggest constructors of conventional and nuclear power
plants.
These 16 RBMK light water gas-cooled reactors have no containment structures
of steel and concrete to stop or lessen the impact of radioactive leaks.
Also, the numerous cooling channels in each reactor block are so arranged
that the graphite used to moderate the reaction process can burn away
dangerously in emergencies.
Another disaster like that at Chernobyl six years ago - it rated the maximum
of seven on the international nuclear accident scale against three for
Sosnovy Bor - would be disastrous for the local population. For the nuclear
industry, it would also be a further setback in terms of image - not just in
Europe, but also in the US.
There are 63 non-RBMK nuclear power stations to worry about; 42 are in
operation and 21 under construction. It is these to which companies like
Siemens, ABB, the Swiss-Swedish power engineering company, and Westinghouse
of the US have directed their attention in the belief that safety could be
improved in stages.
This approach would spread the cost over several years and avoid the
unthinkable alternative for the countries concerned of shutting down the
plants and depriving millions of people of warmth and light. Czechoslovakia,
for instance, obtains 28 per cent of its electricity from nuclear energy and
Hungary as much as 50 per cent.
The big problems are time and money. German Chancellor Helmut Kohl is keen
that nuclear safety in the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) and
eastern Europe should be high on the agenda of the Group of Seven industrial
countries' summit in Munich in July.
Will this stimulate the west into rapid action? 'It will if the other six
countries listen,' asserts Huttl. Any action, however, would have to go
beyond the G7 nations, though they would bear the main load. Germany, most
acutely aware of the problem since it borders on eastern Europe, does not
want to finance the whole exercise alone.
Huttl, who has been helping the Bonn government on this issue, envisages a
three-stage plan which would cost roughly DM12bn (Pounds 4bn), involve a
broad measure of international agreement on basic safety standards and their
implementation, and could be under way in the mid-1990s if work is begun
soon.
Of the 42 non-RBMK nuclear plants, only the relatively recent VVER 230
pressurised water reactors are equipped with safety features comparable to
those in the west. There are 18 of these 1,000 MW plants, of which 16 are in
the CIS countries and two in Bulgaria. However, even these need proper
controls to monitor changes in pressure and temperature and to trigger
action in emergencies.
Those in worst shape are the 10 type VVER 230s (440MW) built up to 20 years
ago. There are four in Russia, four in Bulgaria and two in Czechoslovakia.
These cannot be re-equipped for long-term operation over the next 10 to 20
years at reasonable cost. For one thing, they also have no proper
containment. In west Germany, for instance, nuclear plants have a thick
steel casing and an outer concrete dome to protect them from air crashes.
In between come the VVER213s (also 440MW). These were mostly built at the
end of the 1970s. There are 14 of them: four in the CIS countries, four in
Hungary and six in Czechoslovakia. These have no proper containment
structure, but do at least have a system for allowing pressure to escape.
For all the VVER types, the stage-by-stage plan envisaged by Huttl is as
follows:
Stage one. With a quick start, the next 12 months could be devoted to
installing relatively cheap monitoring equipment to detect water or steam
leaks, cracks in metal and loose floating particles. These devices and
sensors could be fitted for around DM5m per block, or a total cost of some
DM200m for all 42 units. In emergencies, they would shut down the reactors.
At the same time, international agreement must be reached on safety standard
definitions for eastern Europe's nuclear power stations. This could best be
done through the International Atomic Energy Authority in Vienna; the
standards would form the basis of decisions by countries on what to do about
their existing and future power stations.
Stage two. Eastern European governments and utilities would work out what
was needed for each plant. As well as modern controls and instrumentation,
plants would need separate emergency core cooling systems, which would not
necessitate rebuilding the whole plant. These would function during an
accident.
International experts would work with local engineers and officials to
determine what should be done and the likely costs. Loan applications could
then be made. At this stage, it is hard to say how the funds would be
divided between government and private lenders. They would certainly need
government guarantees. Huttl believes the obvious channel for the money
would be the London-based European Bank for Reconstruction and Development.
Stage three. Around DM4bn of Huttl's estimated total would be for imports of
equipment such as electronic controls and DM8bn for work done locally - the
orders would be placed and the work begun. If all goes well, the main
contracts could get under way in 1995 and be completed around 1997.
In five years' time, therefore, the main problems with the Soviet-designed
water pressure reactors could be solved, with monitoring devices put in
early.
The countries with the vulnerable nuclear plants do not have the money; the
western nations do have the funds but their budgets are stretched. 'The sums
of money are not unbearably high for the west and there is no time to
waste,' believes Huttl.

FT  01 APR 92 / FT Law Report: Manager has duty to act faithfully
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TICEHURST AND ANOTHER v BRITISH TELECOMMUNICATIONS PLC Court of Appeal:
(Lord Justice Neill, Lord Justice Ralph Gibson and Lord Justice Stocker):
March 11 1992
INDUSTRIAL action short of striking taken by a manager on trade union
instructions aimed at inconveniencing or damaging the employer, is a breach
of her implied contractual duty to serve him faithfully within the
requirements of her contract, and entitles him to refuse to let her work and
to withhold wages for any period in which she evinces an intention to
withdraw goodwill from her work-performance.
The Court of Appeal so held when allowing an appeal by the defendants,
British Telecommunications plc (BT), from Judge Oddie's decision in the
Mayor's and City of London County Court, that Pounds 817.70 and Pounds
297.66 wages were due to the plaintiffs, Mrs Alison Ticehurst and Mr Michael
Thompson respectively. The appeal judgment referred only to Mrs Ticehurst,
but applied equally to Mr Thompson, a computer support manager employed by
BT.
LORD JUSTICE RALPH GIBSON said Mrs Ticehurst was employed as buildings
manager at BT's Stone Technical College in Staffordshire.
About 30,000 out of the 40,000 executives employed by BT in certain grades,
were represented by the Society of Telecom Executives (STE), a trade union.
STE was seeking a pay increase. From about June 1989, its members took part
in industrial action short of striking, described as 'withdrawal of
goodwill'.
They were instructed to choose work options which would cause the most
inconvenience to BT; not to do certain work not already agreed with the STE;
and not to co-operate with consultants or on projects, or to accept new
practices, unless agreed by STE.
In February 1990, STE members voted in favour of strike action. A half day
strike was called for April 6 1990.
A letter dated April 4 was sent by BT to STE members, saying it was no
longer prepared to tolerate refusals to work in accordance with terms and
conditions of employment. It said that following the April 6 strike,
managers would be expected to work normally, and 'those who are not prepared
to honour fully the terms of their contract can be sent home, without
further notice and without pay, until they are prepared to work normally in
accordance with their contract'.
On April 9, STE decided there should be a rolling campaign of strategic
strikes. All members were instructed to take strike action on April 10 and
11.
Mrs Ticehurst, who had taken part in the half day strike on April 6, also
took part on April 10 and 11.
On April 12, the Thursday before Good Friday, Mrs Ticehurst returned to
work. She was in charge of 40 staff. She worked normally for about two hours
and was then told that because she had taken further strike action she was
to leave the premises, and that on her return to work after the holiday, on
Tuesday April 17, she would be asked to give an undertaking to work
normally.
Mrs Ticehurst attended for work on April 17. She was asked to sign a
document which read: 'I undertake to work normally in accordance with the
terms of my contract with BT from now on and to take no further industrial
action.' She was told if she refused to sign she must leave.
She refused to sign, and left.
The same occurred each working day down to April 26.
Judge Oddie found that her refusal to sign the undertaking was not breach of
contract, nor was it a refusal to obey a reasonable instruction. He held she
was ready, willing and able and wished to return to work.
On the appeal, Mr Burke for BT contended that if an employee was willing to
perform only part of her duties or declined to carry them out properly, with
the object of damaging the employer's business, the employer was not obliged
to accept performance short of full performance and was entitled to refuse
to permit the employee to work, and to refuse to pay wages.
Mr Elias for Mrs Ticehurst submitted that, on the evidence, the only
reasonable inference was that she was willing to do her work fully in
accordance with her contract of employment and without qualification. He
said if that was wrong and she was offering to work subject to
qualification, neither the intention to respond in future to any strike
call, nor to continue withdrawal of goodwill, would constitute breach of
contract.
The appeal would be allowed on the ground that Mrs Ticehurst did not prove
she was ready and willing to work contractually, and she was plainly
evincing the intention to continue withdrawing goodwill in breach of the
implied terms of her contract.
BT was, without bringing the contract of employment to an end, entitled to
refuse to accept part-performance.
It was common ground that before April 12 Mrs Ticehurst had been taking part
in withdrawal of goodwill. STE had called on her to do many things, with the
intention of making BT's business unmanageable.
In ASLEF No. 2 (1972) 2 QB 455,498, where work to rule instructions avoided
a specific direction to breach any express term of the contract but were
aimed at frustrating the employers' commercial activity, Lord Justice
Buckley said there was an implied term in the contracts of employment 'to
serve the employer faithfully within the requirements of the contract'.
He said 'the employee must serve the employer faithfully with a view to
promoting those commercial interests for which he is employed'.
It was necessary to imply such a term in the case of a manager who was in
charge of other employees and who therefore must be entrusted to exercise
her judgment and discretion in giving instructions to others and in
supervising their work.
Such a discretion, if the contract was to work properly, must be exercised
faithfully in the employers' interests.
The term was breached when the employee did an act, or omitted to do an act,
not in honest exercise of choice or discretion for the faithful performance
of her work, but in order to disrupt the employer's business or to cause the
most inconvenience possible.
The action by way of withdrawal of goodwill did have adverse consequences.
If on her return to work Mrs Ticehurst was evincing an intention to continue
to participate in the action of withdrawal of goodwill, BT was in entitled
on that ground, and without terminating the contract of employment, to
refuse to let her remain at work (Miles v Wakefield MDC (1987) 1 AC 539).
The principle in Miles was that an employer did not have to accept and pay
for the work of an employee who was not willing to perform his contract in
full.
If the only intention evinced by Mrs Ticehurst was to continue to respond to
a strike call if and when called upon by her union to strike, she would have
been intending to perform her full contractual duties until sometime in the
future, which might not happen at all, when she would break her contract by
striking.
The evincing of an intention to continue to participate in the strike
campaign did not constitute breach of contract which by itself would have
entitled BT to refuse to permit her to work.
The strike was in sharp contrast with industrial action consisting of an
intention to injure the employer while maintaining that the employee was
working normally.
The intention to continue in the action of withdrawal of goodwill if it was
evinced, did entitle BT to refuse to let Mrs Ticehurst work.
Mrs Ticehurst did evince that intention for the following reasons: She took
an active part in the withdrawal of goodwill before the strikes; STE's
announced intention was that it would continue the withdrawal after the
first strike; STE made no announcement before or after the second strike
that the action would not be continuing; Mrs Ticehurst gave no evidence of
saying to anyone at BT that she would no longer participate.
The appeal was allowed. Their Lordships agreed.
For BT: Jeffrey Burke QC and Roy Lemon (Colin R Green).
For Mrs Ticehurst: Patrick Elias QC and David Bean (Lawford &amp; Co,
Richmond-upon-Thames).

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Pharmaceutical wholesaler UNICHEM, which recently dropped out of the bidding
for wholesale chemists Macarthy, has brought in Grahame Sewell from Arcadian
International as its new finance director.
Peter Dodd, Unichem chief executive, retires in May, to be replaced by Jeff
Harris, the previous finance director and made deputy chief executive.
Sewell, a 42-year-old chartered accountant, had spent just 12 months as
finance director of Arcadian International, a leisure property group. At the
time he joined, Arcadian had been planning a number of acquisitions but
decided instead to develop greenfield sites. Sewell, who sees himself as
'very much from an operations background', decided to move on.
One priority at Unichem will be to develop the retail side of the business.
With one joint venture in Germany, he also sees Unichem pressing ahead with
further European expansion. That is a familiar area for Sewell, who had
earlier spent two years as finance director of the international division of
sports shoe specialist Reebok, and before that worked as one of the first
employees outside the US of software house Lotus Development Corporation.

A torrent of complaints from building society customers has led to the
appointment of a third ombudsman for the industry to work alongside the two
already in place, Stephen Udell and Jane Woodhead.
The new ombudsman will be Brian Murphy, 51, a partner of Farrer &amp; Co, who
specialises in commercial and general litigation, employment law and
industrial relations. He qualified as a solicitor in 1966.
The latest incumbent will take decisions in his own right. He is likely to
have a considerable volume of work; though final figures for 1991-92 will
not be available until June, it looks as if complaints have doubled since
last year.
*****
BAYER, the German chemicals group, has appointed Lennart Aberg as managing
director of its Bayer plc, its UK subsidiary. He replaces John Webb who
becomes chairman, and will work with him for two months before taking up the
new job on July 1.
Aberg, currently managing director of Bayer Sverige in Sweden, said
yesterday that the problems facing Bayer in the UK were similar to those in
Sweden, with low turnover and high costs. However, the scale of the
businesses in the UK, which have a turnover of Pounds 414m and employ about
1,700 people, were larger, he added.
Aberg said it was too early to say what big changes might be implemented.

FT  01 APR 92 / Management: Revving up for an east German drive - Ambitious
plans by Volkswagen and Opel
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW FISHER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Volkswagen and Opel have a clear aim in building their new car assembly
plants in east Germany - they are trying to beat the Japanese at their own
game.
Japanese methods of lean production, cutting out wasted time and materials
and trying to keep costs as low as possible, have swept the motor world.
Other car companies have been forced to adopt the Japanese practices as best
they can or risk being pushed aside by the competition.
Germany's unification has provided what VW and Opel - owned by General
Motors of the US - both see as a golden opportunity.
VW is spending nearly DM5bn (Pounds 1.7bn) on its new plant and Opel DM1bn,
with around a third of the money coming from investment grants and
subsidies. When finished, the plants will be among the world's most modern.
Both are being erected near former east German car production sites.
But while the old Wartburg plant in Eisenach turned out 70,000 cars a year
with 9,000 workers, Opel will produce around 150,000 of its new Astra family
cars with just over 2,000 people at its new site on the edge of the historic
town.
The approach will be new for east Germany, where the old state-owned
companies made most of their own components and equipment. In modern car
plants, the aim is to keep the level of vertical integration - the work
actually done in the plant - as low as possible, with most components being
provided by suppliers.
At the VW plant at Mosel in Saxony, which will turn out 250,000 Golf family
cars a year, only 25 per cent of the components will be made in house.
The plant, employing 6,000 people, will comprise mainly a press shop (which
Opel Eisenach will not have initially), body shop, paint shop, and assembly
of components made elsewhere (including other parts of the VW group) like
engines, axles, and gearboxes.
In west Germany, VW's level of vertical integration is 40 per cent.
Just-in-time delivery is vital to the process.
Both the VW and Opel plants will have a minimum of storage space.
Opel plans to have enough parts next to the Eisenach assembly line for two
hours of operation, with components for several more hours stored elsewhere
on site.
Because suppliers of seats and bumpers will be nearby, these will not have
to be stored at all.
Opel has learned much from GM's experience in its joint ventures with
Japanese motor concerns in the US and Canada. Tom LaSorda, the confident
young Canadian who heads Opel Eisenach, says it takes most European car
plants nearly 36 hours to turn out a new car. US companies need around 25
hours.
He wants to reduce this to 20 hours or less in Eisenach. 'There's a plant in
Japan that's at 13 hours, while Japanese plants in North America are at 18
or 19 hours or even lower, as are some in Europe,' says LaSorda.
Opel and VW aim to be flexible enough to respond to changes in customer
demands, by producing a wide variety of specifications and options, while
lessening vulnerability to falling sales by employing as few people as
possible.
This, of course, increases the strain on suppliers to produce parts cheaply
and deliver quickly. In times of industrial strife, it also makes plants
vulnerable since they have minimal reserves of components. Eventually, Opel
Eisenach hopes to reduce the time needed to complete an order from the
parent company to around two weeks. These days, up to 10 weeks is common in
Europe, but the pressure for change is increasing.
LaSorda foresees more competition from the Japanese in Europe, where they
are increasing their UK manufacturing presence. 'We have to conclude that
they will be successful in Europe. If they are, we've got to be better than
they are.'

FT  01 APR 92 / Management: In sickness and in health - Britain's hospitals
have been undergoing radical reform. Alan Pike assesses whether the medicine
is working
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The National Health Service reforms are one year old today; a decision on
whether to blow out the birthday cake candle will be taken by the electorate
on April 9.
Next week's election will determine whether the changes introduced by the
government last year are to become the pattern of NHS management for the
rest of the century, or whether the service faces further restructuring.
NHS managers have spent 12 painful and exhausting months introducing changes
which many believe should have been better planned and tested before
implementation. But an incoming government committed to unpicking the
reforms - as both Labour and the Liberal Democrats are - would find those
same managers opposed to a return to the NHS structure in which they worked
only a year ago.
Separating managerial judgments from political ones is near impossible in
the NHS, where managers are walled-in between Whitehall guidance notes and
questions in Parliament. The judgment on whether the reforms are good or bad
for health care in Britain is ultimately political. But to the extent that
the reforms can be assessed on their managerial merits, they have rapidly
achieved a high degree of backing from within the service.
There is one particular reason for this - a separation of management
functions which has become known as the purchaser-provider split. Since last
April, individual managers have been responsible for either providing
services - running hospitals, community or ambulance services - or bying
them.
Purchasers, with finite budgets, must not only seek value-for-money from
providers but plan spending priorities. They must decide whether, for
example, more resources should be devoted to reducing a district's
relatively high death rate from heart disease. And if so, what services will
go down the list of priorities as a result?
There is a widely-held view among managers that the purchaser-provider split
is helping to reshape the NHS into natural component parts, focusing
individual managers' attention on distinct functions rather than a canvas so
vast that the picture must inevitably be obscure.
'I cannot now find a manager who says that the purchaser-provider split is
not the way to achieve change and improve efficiency,' says Pamela
Charlwood, director of the Institute of Health Services Management.
The existing contracts between purchasers and providers are not likely to
survive a Conservative defeat. Labour would retain the separation of
managerial functions but scrap the symbol of the provider's independence,
the self-governing trust hospital.
A case can be made for this - the split already operates in management terms
in districts which do not have trust hospitals. Many managers would not
complain if trusts lost some powers, like the ability to sell assets. But
the IHSM believes the relatively independent status of trusts is necessary
to run the purchaser-provider split effectively.
'The umbilical cord between the purchasing and providing functions is still
in place in those districts where health authorities manage hospitals
directly,' says Charlwood. 'Managers are drawn too much into day-to-day
operational rather than strategic decision-making, and I think there is a
risk of their carrying on with existing patterns of service provision rather
than examining alternatives.'
Although managers of the first self-governing trusts have spent much of the
past year struggling to break-even under a still highly-confined financial
regime, there has been room for innovation as well.
When Central Middlesex hospital in west London became a trust last April, it
announced plans to restructure its services according to what the patient
wants. This approach, being pioneered in a few US hospitals, involves
replaces the old institutional structure of a hospital with
multi-disciplinary teams working in a series of medical, surgical and other
specialist centres. The aim is to transform the hospital from a centralised
institution into a delivery system for a range of services which are closer
to patients' actual needs.
One year on, Central Middlesex has set up its own in-house team to train
staff and will start introducing patient-focused techniques in two
departments in August.
The changes will transform working practices. Andy Black, the Central
Middlesex's chief executive, is convinced they are happening only because
trust status has enabled all planning to take place locally between
managers, doctors and nurses who have an equal stake in the scheme's
success.
Central Middlesex is a typical London local hospital, little known outside
the area it serves. St Thomas', in central London, is world-famous for its
clinical services but until recently also enjoyed a reputation within the
NHS for financial problems and the highly-politicised nature of its health
authority meetings. A new management team has brought St Thomas' into
financial surplus and just published its first corporate business plan.
This sets a series of central objectives for 1992-93 - to secure contracts
which at least maintain present treatment numbers; reduce costs by 5 per
cent; meet new quality standards; shift the provision of care towards more
cost-effective day and out-patient work with local general practitioners and
offer an improved range of services.
'In the past, managers had to say to doctors that we didn't want them to
work more efficiently - we wanted them to save money, and this usually
involved reducing the amount of work they could do,' says Tim Matthews, St
Thomas' chief executive.
'Now we have a management structure which involves medical staff in
budgeting and decision-making, and this is producing ideas for reducing unit
costs and generating income rather than just squeezing cash out of the
system.'
Matthews and John Pelly, his finance director, hope that rather than
resorting to the NHS's usual recipe for achieving 5 per cent savings - ward
closures - they will be able to raise a good deal from income generation
instead.
They plan to market occupational health services, an area of activity which
the NHS has largely left to the private sector.
St Thomas' currently has contracts with the Foreign Office and the London
Fire Brigade and will seek more.
Consultants will be encouraged to treat private patients at St Thomas'
rather than in surrounding independent hospitals. The hospital's central
London car park has been identified as a significant source of income.
The notion of hospitals having to sell services to outside customers may be
too commercial for purist tastes but, say managers, it is being done to help
maintain services which in the old bureaucratic days would simply have been
closed down.
A change of government would see an end to the commercial language which has
entered the NHS vocabulary in the past three years, and probably to some of
the fringe commercial activity.
But the challenge for a new government would be to ensure that the sharper
managerial thinking which has begun growing in the service did not disappear
as well.
Andy Black, reflecting on the changes which have taken place at Central
Middlesex since the hospital became a trust last year, remarks that he has
bought a bigger waste paper basket.
'If I didn't ignore vast amounts of central guidance, I wouldn't get the job
of running the hospital done.'
Whatever the fate of the health reforms after April 9, NHS managers hope
that the small flame of independence and accountability evidenced in that
brave remark will not be extinguished.

FT  01 APR 92 / Election 1992: Lib Dems court key tactical voters
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LIBERAL Democrats changed tack in their campaign yesterday and appealed
directly to voters in more than 260 seats where the former Alliance parties
came second in 1987, mostly to the Conservatives.
The switch away from policy issues marked a recognition that the party's
chances of making gains next week depend heavily on mobilising
anti-Conservative voters.
Mr Des Wilson, campaign director, avoided talk of 'tactical voting'. The
party is determined to be even-handed and highlight also the seats where
they are second to Labour. But they risk upsetting supporters in
constituencies not on Mr Wilson's list.
Ironically, the launch coincided with campaigning by Mr Paddy Ashdown,
Liberal Democrat leader, in Scotland where the party benefits from the
first-past-the-post system. Liberal Democrats are defending 10 Scottish
seats and may lose only one or two.
In the vast Inverness constituency, where Liberal Democrat Sir Russell
Johnston faces a difficult task fighting off Labour, Mr Ashdown's visit was
overshadowed by Scottish nationalist protesters who out-shouted a rainy
walkabout in the shopping centre.
Adding to Mr Ashdown's misfortune, his visit had to be truncated when the
closure of Aberdeen airport forced a long coach journey and the
cancellations of events there. At a rally in the city Mr Ashdown said: 'In
nearly half of the constituencies at this election, it is the Liberal
Democrats who are the challengers. As we move forward again, it is
increasingly the Liberal Democrats who can win.'
The Liberal Democrat campaign against the 'wasted vote' syndrome reflects
frustration about the domination of the campaign by Labour and the Tories.
A party election broadcast today will list 261 constituencies, mostly in
southern England, where the Liberal Democrats are the main challengers and
refer to three-way marginals where the party might also have a chance.
Afterwards the campaign will be focused at a local level in 'best prospect'
seats.
Mr Wilson quoted a Harris survey in September showing 47 per cent of voters
would back Liberal Democrats if the party had a chance of winning.
In Aberdeen, Mr Ashdown said a sign of the growing Liberal Democrat success
was 'the sign of the growing panic of the other two parties'. At his London
press conference earlier Mr Ashdown had said: 'There is something different
happening out there.'

FT  01 APR 92 / Election 1992: Tax concern displaces many broader issues -
City Watch
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARRY RILEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FINANCIAL markets may go up and down (mostly down, so far) but how will the
City of London itself be affected by the election outcome? European economic
and monetary union is one key issue. By the end of this year the European
Community is due to choose the location of the new European Central Bank
(ECB). The UK will hold the EC presidency for six months from July, so the
decision could be taken at Edinburgh summit in December.
The Labour party is committed to active Emu negotiations; its manifesto says
that the ECB's headquarters should be in Britain (though, curiously, not
specifically in London). The Liberal Democrats are also positive about Emu.
But the Conservative wait-and-see approach is scarcely designed to lure an
important community institution.
According to Mr Richard Brealey, a London Business School professor: 'Where
the central bank is based hardly matters. Where it deals clearly does.'
Another significant decision in late 1992 could well concern the choice of a
new governor of the Bank of England, to succeed Mr Robin Leigh-Pemberton in
July 1993. The Liberal Democrats want to give the Bank independent powers;
the other manifestos are muted on this. However, the Maastricht Treaty
committed any future British government to start in 1994 the process leading
to independence for the Bank.
Mr David Lomax, economic adviser to National Westminster Bank, thinks the
Conservatives could turn out to have a much more positive attitude to the EC
in the next parliament, given the departure of many leading hardliners.
As for a Labour regime, he argues that it would repudiate the notorious
opt-out clause inserted by the Conservative government at Maastricht. 'I see
Europe as a struggle for power. The opt-out clause is really quite
debilitating in that respect for the UK.'
Labour's more positive attitude to Europe counts for little in the City
compared with its threatened tough tax regime for high-earners. There are
fears that foreign financial executives would move overseas if their
income-tax rate jumped from 40 to 59 per cent.
It is possible, though, that a Labour chancellor might be willing to make
tax concessions to foreigners, as Mr Denis Healey did in the 1970s.
Another damaging tax development might be the retention of  1/2 per cent
stamp duty on share deals, set for abolition when the Stock Exchange Taurus
electronic settlement system is running. The shadow Budget retained stamp
duty worth almost Pounds 800m for 1993-94, but suggested it might still be
abolished, albeit a further year late.
Little is said on investor protection in the manifestos, apart from a
somewhat surprising Conservative proposal to shift overall responsibility
for financial regulation from the Department of Trade and Industry to the
Treasury.
In general it is likely that Labour would be more interventionist than the
Conservatives have been and might not be so willing for the crises to drag
on indefinitely at Lloyd's of London, for example.

FT  01 APR 92 / Watchdog lifts sales suspension
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WINDSOR Life, the Telford-based life assurance company, said yesterday that
regulators have lifted a 'voluntary suspension' of its sales force. The
suspension was imposed on March 19 following a revision of training and
testing procedures.
The move will allow some of the company's agents to resume selling today.
The remainder of the agents are likely to be back at work soon.
The company also said that its chief executive, Mr Brian Wood, has resigned
and has been replaced by Mr William Yelverton, head of international
operations at New York Life, Windsor's parent company.
Lautro, the self-regulatory body for the life assurance industry, asked
Windsor to suspend its own sales force following a routine compliance review
in December.
Lautro would not comment on the shortcomings it found, but it is believed
that sales agents were unable to answer basic questions about the products
they were selling or about the financial circumstances of their clients.
Windsor Life said that a new training and testing programme has been
designed for the company with the assistance of Coopers &amp; Lybrand Deloitte
and City solicitors Linklaters &amp; Paines.
Only those sales agents who have passed the new training and testing
procedure and for whom 'fit and proper' reference checks have been provided
will be able to resume selling.
Windsor Life said that following a review, it did not believe that any of
its clients had lost money as a result of the actions of its sales agents.

FT  01 APR 92 / Lautro may limit penalties for early ending of policies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LIFE assurance companies could face limits on the charges they pass on to
customers who terminate policies before maturity, under measures proposed by
a consultant to Lautro, the industry's self-regulatory body.
The proposals could require companies to make significant changes to the
system of paying sales agents.
The current system allows commissions to be paid 'up-front' as soon as the
policy is signed.
It could also address one of the most persistent complaints about the life
assurance industry - the small percentage of premiums which are refunded to
those who cancel policies early.
Those who cancel within the first two years of the policy may lose up to 100
per cent of premiums paid. A recent study by the Securities and Investments
Board found that between a quarter and a third of all policies are cancelled
within the first two years.
The proposals are contained in an expository paper written by Mr Marshall
Field, a consulting actuary for Bacon and Woodrow, who has been asked by
Lautro to review the industry's commissions structure.
Lautro will decide later this year whether new regulations on commisssions
are necessary.
In the paper, Mr Field argues that the industry practice of charging all the
sales commission to the cancelling policyholder may be unfair and unwise.
Companies would have more incentive to prevent mis-selling - the sale of
policies to those for whom they are inappropriate - if they had to bear more
of the costs themselves.
The case against charging sales costs to those who end their policies early
becomes even greater in the case of those who were mis-sold policies and are
being charged for the mischance.
He proposes that sales costs be passed on in the product design. Thus, the
life fund might be charged with a fixed - and publicly disclosed - amount
each month to cover the sales costs both for policies which last until
maturity and those which do not.
Should more policyholders maintain their contracts until maturity, the life
fund would earn additional profits.

FT  01 APR 92 / Pledge by Gould on County Hall use
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LABOUR said yesterday it was determined to use County Hall, the former home
of the Greater London Council, as the headquarters of its proposed
replacement for the GLC.
That means a Labour government would exercise an opt-out clause in the
contract selling the complex to the Osaka-based Shirayama Corporation.
Mr Bryan Gould, shadow environment secretary, said: 'We want to put the
whole site to proper use in the public sector.' He indicated that the party
expected to 'work closely' with the London School of Economics, which had
hoped before the Shirayama deal to move from its present cramped
accomodation to County Hall.
The party intends to use the building to house its planned 'slimline'
Greater London Authority, members of which are to be elected by proportional
representation. Labour believes, however, that enough room would be left to
put the building to additional public-sector use.
Mr Gould said yesterday that Labour would exercise the clause permitting the
Shirayama deal to be terminated up to the end of this year. He said the
party had 'yet to see the detail of the agreement'.
Shirayama, a family-owned property company, signed a contract last week to
buy the complex on the south bank of the Thames from the London Residuary
Body, the organisation responsible for winding up the affairs of the GLC.
Shirayama intends to convert part of the complex into a hotel, with the rest
being used for luxury flats and conference facilities.
Mr Gould said the cost of establishing the GLA would be 'very slight' and
might even yield a 'small saving to the taxpayer' from rationalising the
budgets of the various bodies whose activities it would take over.

FT  01 APR 92 / West Midlands chambers see indications of recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SCATTERED signs that the West Midlands economy may be starting to move out
of recession have emerged from a survey of companies in the region by
chambers of commerce which was published yesterday.
For the fourth quarter in succession, a growing proportion of manufacturing
companies have reported an increase in both home and export orders.
The same is true for service companies on the domestic market, but the
proportion experiencing a rise in export orders fell in the March quarter
after three successive quarterly increases.
The chambers' survey covered the performance of almost 450 companies, split
nearly evenly between the manufacturing and service sectors. Membership is
strongly weighted towards small and medium-sized companies. The west
Midlands region is regarded widely as a barometer for the state of UK
industry.
The returns for the March quarter in the chambers' series of three-monthly
surveys show that, in manufacturing, nearly 30 per cent of companies have
growing order books. In the services sector, 30 per cent of companies have
lengthening order books for the home market, and 26 per cent for exports.
But the survey also shows that cashflow remains a significant problem for
most companies and that investment intentions remain subdued. Moreover, up
to 20 per cent of companies are still intending to lay off personnel. All of
this suggests that the proverbial light at the end of the recession tunnel
is only dimly visible.
Mr Howard Davis, chairman of the west Midlands group of chambers, said there
was 'a serious problem of overtrading looming for cash-strapped companies
who have survived so far, but may find they cannot finance swelling order
books.'

FT  01 APR 92 / World Trade News: Malaysia in frigate deal with GEC
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MALAYSIA has ordered two frigates from Yarrow Shipbuilders, part of the
British GEC group, in a package worth Pounds 400m.
The deal, confirmed by GEC yesterday, is considerably larger than expected
and provides a crucial boost to the Yarrow yard on Clydeside. The
long-awaited contract, held up since last autumn by negotiating
difficulties, is the first overseas warship order Yarrow has won since it
was sold by the UK government in 1985.
The 105-metre helicopter-carrying frigates are larger vessels than the
corvettes that were originally under discussion with Yarrow. Their armament
includes BAe Vertical-Launch Sea Wolf missiles for air defence, the first
export order for these weapons.
The Malaysian order, which includes weapons, electronic systems, spares and
training, brings to well over Pounds 1bn the volume of defence purchases
under a 1988 agreement between the the UK and Malaysian governments. Other
contracts include British Aerospace Hawk jets and GEC-Marconi air-defence
radars.
The deal follows confirmation earlier last month of a Pounds 150m deal for
two smaller corvettes for Oman by another UK warship builder, Vosper
Thornycroft.

FT  01 APR 92 / World Trade News: Perot draws support from across the US as
the Not-Bush-or-Clinton candidate
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
MORE than one American in five would vote for H. Ross Perot, the Texas
businessman, in a three-way presidential contest with George Bush and Bill
Clinton, according to a nationwide poll conducted for the Los Angeles Times.
The degree of discontent with what is still the most likely match in
November is underlined by the extraordinary fact that a third of those
surveyed said they knew virtually nothing about what Mr Perot stood for.
Fleshing out his proto-candidacy as an independent, Mr Perot has named
retired Admiral William Stockdale, who spent eight years as a prisoner of
war in Vietnam, as his 'interim' vice-presidential running mate. He needed
to identify a number two by name in order to qualify for the ballot in 28
states. He has said he will run only if he is on the ballot in every state.
The poll, of 1,521 adults conducted last weekend, gave Mr Bush 37 per cent,
Mr Clinton 35 per cent and Mr Perot 21 per cent in a three-way contest.
Without Mr Perot, Mr Bush held a slim 48-46 per cent edge over Mr Clinton,
who, in turn, led Mr Jerry Brown by a wide 53-25 per cent in preference for
the Democratic nomination.
The latter findings will come as some relief to Mr Clinton, otherwise
pressed at every turn by Mr Brown's insurgent campaign in advance of the New
York, Wisconsin and Kansas primaries next Tuesday. One New York TV poll,
which did not predict a Clinton-Brown result, confirmed that the state's
voters harbour ever increasing doubts about the front-runner's integrity.
It suggested that Mr Perot's putative support was drawn equally from Mr Bush
and Mr Clinton. But its most telling finding was that 72 per cent of those
surveyed thought the country was 'heading in the wrong direction'. Mr Brown
has also capitalised on this sentiment.
Some caution obviously is in order. Independent candidacies often look
better in the spring than in the election proper and, in all postwar
elections, only one - the regional favourite, George Wallace from Alabama -
scored in double digits, in 1968. At about this time in 1980, a comparable
Los Angeles Times poll gave John Anderson 23 per cent, which fell to a mere
7 per cent of the vote in November.
But 1980 was a very different political year. Mr Anderson, a liberal
Republican, ran as an alternative to Ronald Reagan's conservatism and
President Jimmy Carter's indecision but was eventually squeezed out by the
two main party juggernauts.
Neither is now running on all cylinders and the electorate is more clearly
disenchanted. In this vacuum, Mr Perot, inundated with telephone calls
urging him to run, must be encouraged by national poll findings like this
one and has the financial resources to wage a campaign.

A Dollars 850m (Pounds 496m) integrated pulp and paper factory is to be
built in Aceh, northen Sumatra, Mr Hartarto, Indonesia's industry minister,
announced on Monday. Initial capacity is expected to be about 75,000 tonnes
a year, although Mr Hartarto said the plant would eventually reach 1,000
tonnes per day.
The plant, expected to start production of rayon-grade pulp in 1995, is a
joint venture between PT Risjadson Holding and Investment Company of
Indonesia, with 60 per cent of the equity, and Ballarpur Industries Ltd of
India, with 40 per cent. Ballarpur will manage the plant.
Indonesia's pulp and paper industry has a total capacity of over 2.5m tonnes
a year from more than 50 mills and is growing fast. In 1990, pulp production
increased 223 per cent to 682,700 tonnes, with production in 1991 estimated
at 981,000 tonnes. Paper production increased from 1.1m tonnes in 1990 to an
estimated 1.47m tonnes last year.
The industry's capacity will increase further this year with the expected
completion of a Dollars 111m newsprint plant in Cibinong, owned by PT Aspex
of Indonesia, with a capacity of 100,000 tonnes a year.

FT  01 APR 92 / World Trade News: Renault keeps faith with its plans in
Slovenia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NOVO MESTO, SLOVENIA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
WARS do not sell cars, as Mr Bernard Coursat, the general director of Revoz,
in which Renault holds the majority stake, is realising.
Nevertheless, the large, modern plant in Novo Mesto, an hour's drive from
Ljubljana, the Slovene capital, continues to increase production with the
expectation that exports to France, which account for 65 per cent of total
sales, will remain steady, and exports to the former Yugoslavia will pick
up.
The figures for the latter market are far from encouraging. Since last
October, when the civil war in neighbouring Croatia was at its worst, a
total of 2,500 cars were told to Serbia, the biggest of the Yugoslav
republics. Renault sold 200 cars, and Volkswagen, which has a plant in
Sarajevo, the capital of Bosnia-Hercegovina, sold 1,000 vehicles to a
republic which has a population of over 8.5m. 'This is serious,' said Mr
Coursat.
Transport and communications difficulties in Yugoslavia have also affected
sales. Despite this, Renault will assemble the Clio, successor to the
Renault 5, at its plant in Novo Mesto. Having already invested FFr800m
(Pounds 82.5m) in the project, Renault remains committed to boosting
production and sales.
In 1989, a year after Renault formed Revoz - a joint venture with IMV, the
Slovene state-owned engineering and vehicle manufacturing plant which had
been transformed into a stock-holding company - Renault was producing 47,500
units, consisting of the Renault 4 and 5 models. The figure increased to
67,915 in 1990, and to 74,976 in 1991.
Mr Anton Repovs, production head at the plant, said assembly of the Clio
would push up annual production to 75,000. Daily productivity is set to
increase from 360 units to 450 units.
Renault, which first started assembling cars in Slovenia 18 years ago and
which recently increased its stake in Revoz to 54 per cent, believes low
labour costs among a skilled-labour force provides the main incentive for
assembling the Clio in Slovenia. The wage bills are between four and five
times lower than in France.
Renault also has close links with Ljubljanska Banka, which holds a monopoly
in the banking sector and which holds 26 per cent of IMV's 46 per cent stake
in Revoz. Cheap labour bills and good financial connections apart, Mr
Coursat remains preoccupied with regaining the markets of the former
Yugoslavia. He has little choice.
The Slovene market, which normally accounts for 10 per cent of total annual
car sales to Yugoslavia, remains too small for Renault - Slovenia has a
population of 2m. Renault already holds 48 per cent of the republic's car
market, and 10 per cent of the Yugoslav market.
'We have to do everything to regain our market share, and increase it, in
the former Yugoslavia,' said Mr Repovs. 'This market, and the markets in
south-eastern Europe, are potentially huge. Already we have set up bilateral
contracts with the republics of Macedonia and Bosnia-Hercegovina to sell
cars. We have no choice but to keep expanding in this part of Europe.'

FT  01 APR 92 / UK says Libya is stopping Britons leaving
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK NICHOLSON, Middle East Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN yesterday accused Libya of preventing a number of foreigners,
including some UK nationals, from leaving the country as the United Nations
Security Council moved to vote to impose sanctions on Libya, including a ban
on air links.
The foreign office, echoing reports from European embassies in Tripoli, said
several people had been refused exit visas in the past 10 days and that the
matter had been raised with Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the UN Secretary
General.
European envoys in Tripoli met yesterday afternoon and agreed to hand the
Libyan government a formal letter of complaint demanding the swift issue of
exit visas.
Poland said 50 of its citizens had been refused documents and one diplomat
said a further 25 Europeans had encountered difficulties.
Mr Douglas Hurd, the UK foreign secretary, described the matter in a BBC
radio interview as 'thoroughly unsatisfactory', adding it could be a ploy by
Libya to obstruct the imposition of sanctions.
But the foreign office said the position in Tripoli was 'patchy and unclear'
and there was no certainty that Libya was deliberately blocking visas to
Britons or other nationalities. A small number of visas had been issued in
the last few days, including to Britons, officials said.
A diplomat at the Italian embassy in Tripoli, which has represented British
interests in Libya since diplomatic links were cut, said by telephone: 'We
think it's just a general delay. There's no panic here.'
The granting of visas usually takes four or five days in Libya and what some
diplomats in Tripoli called an 'unusual slowing' in the process may in part
be due to the effects of Ramadan and the proximity of the Eid al Fitr
holiday to mark its end on April 5.
Britain, along with the US, last month urged the 5,000 or so Britons working
in Libya to 'consider carefully' leaving the country in view of the
prospective ban on air links.
The US state department said it had no information about any difficulties
faced by the 1,000 or so Americans working in Libya. Thousands of foreigners
work in the country including 15,000 Indians, 5,000 Britons, 5,000 South
Koreans, 2,800 Poles, 600 Germans, and 500 French citizens.
The air ban, along with an arms embargo and curbs on the size and status of
Libyan representation abroad, will take effect on April 15 unless Libya
surrenders two men suspected of bombing a Pan Am flight over Lockerbie in
1988.
Tony Walker adds from Cairo: Traffic across Egypt's remote western border
with Libya is expected to increase after the imposition of the UN ban on
aviation links.
Shipping from Egyptian ports is also likely to benefit from the air embargo.
Others among Libya's neighbours who are also certain to experience a jump in
'transit' traffic include Tunisia, which shares a land border, and Malta.
Col Gadaffi's recent threat, in an interview with the French weekly Figaro
magazine, that he would refuse to do business with 'hostile' countries, such
as France, indicates Libya will endeavour to be more selective in its choice
of trading partners. 'I make it quite clear and what I am telling you is a
warning: whoever supports our political cause will benefit from all our
projects. Whoever stands against our political cause will get nothing.'
Western officials in Cairo say that while Egypt will probably fall
reluctantly into line with the letter of the UN resolutions, it will do what
it can to soften the blow to Libya by facilitating movement of goods and
personnel that would normally have gone by aircraft.

<TEXT>
CHINESE legislators have expressed unusual criticism of Prime Minister Li
Peng's annual report, urging faster economic growth in keeping with senior
leader Deng Xiaoping's call for bold reforms, AP reports from Beijing.
Even though Li echoed Deng's call for bolder economic reforms, accounts in
the official media suggest many delegates at the annual session of the
National People's Congress believe the prime minister is not adequately
promoting the changes.
The official Xinhua News Agency yesterday quoted army delegate Wei Mingyi as
saying Li's proposed 6 per cent rate for economic growth in 1992 was too
low. China's growth rate for 1991 was 7 per cent. 'This does not accord with
the spirit of speeding up economic development,' Xinhua paraphrased Wei as
saying.
Another delegate said many local enterprises lost key decision-making powers
after the central government imposed anti-inflation measures in 1988. Others
criticised the government for failing to streamline the bureaucracy.
Xinhua also reported on several delegates opposing the plan to build the
world's largest hydroelectric project, at the Three Gorges on the Yangtze
River. Li has been a main backer of the dam.
A senior Chinese official acknowledged yesterday that Beijing is collecting
information on Hong Kong residents, but denied they would be arrested after
China takes control of the territory in 1997.
Tao Siju, China's minister of public security, told the government-owned
Hong Kong radio that Beijing keeps files on scores of Hong Kong residents.
Many of them are believed to be pro-democracy activists.

FT  01 APR 92 / Pretoria agrees to continue VAT exemption on basic foods: Du

</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The South African government yesterday agreed to continue exempting certain
basic foodstuffs from value added tax, giving in to pressure from trade
unions, business and church groupings.
When VAT was introduced last September, at a rate of 10 per cent, nine food
items were exempted for a six month period, which ended last night. The
introduction of the tax was accompanied by a general strike opposing the
method in which it was introduced, and further mass action had been promised
if the exemptions were lifted.
Mr Barend du Plessis, finance minister, who made yesterday's announcement,
continues to stress that exemptions mitigate against maximum efficiency of
the tax, which requires the broadest possible base.
Business and church leaders argued that the exemption should continue given
the current high unemployment and recession. Mr du Plessis might not
otherwise have heeded the similar protests by Cosatu, the dominant union
grouping, with whose leadership there exists a well established antipathy.
The temporary zero rating on milk and rice will be lifted as planned. But it
will stay in place for the time being for samp, mealie (maize) rice, dried
whole mealies, dried beans, soya beans, lentils, tinned pilchards, milk
powder and dairy powder mixture. Brown bread and mealie meal were granted a
long-term zero rating from the outset.
Mr du Plessis pointed out that the exemption of mealie meal and brown bread
cost the state R1bn (Pounds 200m) a year. Maintaining the exemption on the
other foodstuffs will cost the state R136m this year, but it will receive
R244m from the tax on rice and milk.
The government's case for not zero rating foods initially rested on the fact
that it planned to offer nutritional assistance schemes to the most needy.
Last year R220m was voted in the budget towards this cause with a further
R440m provided for in the 1992-93 budget tabled last month.
However, only half the R220m was spent in the last financial year, much of
it on setting up delivery structures.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Bettino Craxi, Italy's Socialist leader, yesterday hinted that he would
not seek to head a fresh coalition government if his party fared poorly in
next Sunday's general elections.
Until now both the Socialists and their Christian Democrat allies have based
their election campaign on a call for a strong vote to ensure their long
standing partnership could provide a stable basis for the country's next
government.
There has been an understanding that the premiership should change parties
and be offered to Mr Craxi, who headed two coalition governments from 1983
to 1987.
However, the Socialist vote risks being eroded by electoral discontent with
the outgoing administration and recent allegations of corruption involving
prominent party figures.
In an interview published yesterday by the daily Corriere della Sera, Mr
Craxi claimed to be confident about the outcome but added: 'Even a limited
negative signal (from the electorate) would mean a defeat and we could not
but draw conclusions - and natuthe 1987 elections, the Socialists obtained
14.3 per cent of the vote. Before this campaign, the party believed it could
increase this percentage; but a lacklustre campaign and the arrest of Mr
Mario Chiesa, a prominent member of the ruption charges have led
commentators to predict that the Socialists will have difficulty retaining
their share of the vote.
Mr Craxi's threat not to offer himself as a candidate for the premiership
appears designed to rally the Socialist vote behind him.
It underlines the concern of the Socialists and Christian Democrats that
they will fail to secure a parliamentary majority, with their two small
allies, the Liberals (PLI) and the Social Democrats (PSDI).

COMPAGNIE Financiere Delmas-Vieljeux (CFDV), France's leading shipping
group, is likely to be fined by the European Commission today for its
involvement in a cartel which allegedly eliminated competition between
freight lines operating between France and West Africa.
The Commission is also expected to impose conditions on the operation of
freight services between France and French-speaking West African countries.
Officials refused to comment on the level of the fine, or the extent of the
restrictions ahead of today's full Commission meeting, but the punishment is
likely to be severe.
The Danish government and the Danish shipowners' association complained to
the Commission that CFDV - part of Bollore, the French transport and
industrial conglomerate - was at the centre of a shipowners' cartel called
Secretama, which managed shipping trade with African countries. Other French
and European companies involved will also be fined.
Bollore was forced to buy out the minority shareholders in CFDV for FFr1.1bn
(Pounds 110m) last year, following a landmark stock exchange ruling. The
group has claimed that CFDV never revealed the extent or seriousness of the
Commission's investigation.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SWEDEN will allow increased competition in its electricity market in line
with developments in the European Community, the government said yesterday.
Customers will be free to shop around for suppliers offering the lowest
electricity prices in future, and power and other companies will be able to
import and export electricity to neighbouring countries.
Those companies which have a concession to operate power lines in certain
areas will be forced to open their lines to other suppliers and users. In
addition, the government said it was preparing legislation concerning
competition in the electricity market, and promised that its competitiveness
would be 'continually monitored'.
The proposals were welcomed by the Confederation of Swedish Industry
yesterday. Mr Lars Gunnar Larsson, head of the CSI's energy and environment
division, said industry members had been eager to see more competition on
electricity prices.
The government has started to reform the electricity industry already.
Vattenfall, the state-owned electricity company which supplies about half
the country's electricity, is being prepared for wider ownership as part of
the government's ambitious privatisation programme, although no date has
been set yet.
The remaining electricity suppliers are mainly owned by the local
authorities or by private companies. One company - the big forestry group
SCA - recently agreed to sell its power operations in view of the
forthcoming changes in the electricity market.
In the past, many of the electricity-intensive industries had their own
power suppliers so that they could be independent of the regional power
monopolies.
The government said 'substantial gains stand to be made by making the
electricity sector more efficient, and by facilitating increased trade in
electricity across borders'.

BY LAUNCHING its campaign for the Italian elections with a three-day
convention in the film studios of Rome's Cinecitta with Federico Fellini as
patron, the small Republican Party took the risk of looking too big for its
boots.
Against the back-drop of a flashy set, the Republicans, who have always
prided themselves as a minority centre-left party backed by the cream of
business and the intellectual elite, analysed Italy's ills and called loudly
for institutional reform and tough economic management.
Yet with only four days before Italians vote in general elections on Sunday,
the pretensions of the Republicans and their leader, Mr Giorgio La Malfa,
appear to have paid off. Alone among the traditional parties, the
Republicans have come through the campaign confident of substantially
increasing their vote.
Commentators suggest the party could get up to 7 per cent of the vote,
perhaps more, doubling their poor performance in the 1987 general elections.
This may still appear a small percentage but in a fragmented political arena
it would be more than sufficient to convert Mr La Malfa and the Republicans
into key players determining the nature of the next coalition government.
At 52, and an economist educated at Cambridge and Massachusetts Institute of
Technology, he has finally emerged from the political shadow of his late
father, Ugo, who dominated the party for 30 years, casting it in the role of
'the honest conscience of government'.
He has exploited the party's 'clean' image and enjoyed a sympathetic press
from the most influential newspapers.
His calls for institutional change and the need for competent economic
management have struck a chord in the north among disillusioned Christian
Democrats, former Communists, and especially Socialists in the latter's
stronghold of Milan as a result of corruption scandals.
His party has been the only one to gather together a panel of distinguished
economists to prescribe how Italy should face the daunting task of
implementing the EC's summit agreement at Maastricht.
The greatest compliment paid to Mr La Malfa's increased political weight has
been the way leading Christian Democrat and Socialist politicians have
chosen to attack him. They know he has been poaching supporters and
acquiring a higher profile. The Christian Democrats and Socialists also feel
a sense of betrayal at the way this natural partner in government has gone
against them: the Republicans have been present in 23 of the 50 governments
Italy has had since 1945.
Mr Giulio Andreotti, the outgoing prime minister, has not forgiven Mr La
Malfa for removing Republican support when he was trying to form a new
government last April. Although Mr La Malfa walked out in high dudgeon in a
seemingly petty row over portfolio allocations, the decision has
subsequently been presented as a careful tactical move to distance himself
from a discredited government.
This distancing act enabled the Republicans to avoid being tainted by the
failures of the past legislature and present themselves either as an
opposition, or as a repository of votes for those who wish the party to
influence a future coalition. Mr La Malfa said he would only back the next
government if it were composed of technicians committed to carry out a clear
programme of reforms.

FT  01 APR 92 / Yeltsin concludes federal treaty
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Boris Yeltsin's Russian Federation yesterday concluded a federal
treaty designed to cement it together for the post-Soviet era.
Eighteen of the 20 'republics' within the 150m strong Federation, together
with the leaders of Russian administrative regions and the mayors of Moscow
and St Petersburg, signed the treaty in a formal ceremony at the Kremlin.
Created by Stalin as part of a divide and rule policy, the autonomous
republics were set up to house Russia's ethnic minorities, even though the
biggest group, the Tatars, were scattered over four republics. The ceremony
was marred by a boycott by Tatarstan, the biggest of the autonomous
republics, and Chechnya, where a state of emergency was called yesterday
after internecine fighting broke out. But the treaty may allay fears that
the country itself will break up like the Soviet Union did before it.
President Yeltsin warned that the challenge now would be to implement 'every
article' of the treaty, despite the fact that he has had to conclude a
series of deals, chiefly over property and taxation, to get individual
participants on board.
The treaty was designed to be a section of a future Russian constitution.
Its main provisions are as follows:
The federal government is responsible for foreign policy, defence, defending
civil rights and protecting ethnic minorities; defining federal policy for
the social, political and economic development of the Russian Federation;
establishing the foundations for a common market, financial and monetary
policy, customs regulations, a federal budget and taxation policy; running
federal energy, transport, and communications systems.
Responsibilities shared between the federal government, the republics and
the regions include: ensuring that legislation is in accordance with the
constitution; law enforcement; management, use and ownership of land,
minerals and other natural resources; common matters of health, education
and culture.
Republics are responsible for every other area except those they have
delegated to the Russian Federation.
Disputes are to be resolved through the use of conciliatory procedures, to
be specified in a future constitution.
Russian is the official language in the Federation although republics can
also have their own official language. Stopping short of outright secession,
Tatarstan is negotiating a separate treaty with the Russian Federation.
With some republics still under the firm grip of their old Communist rulers,
they have also provided a focus of opposition to President Yeltsin's radical
reforms.
But apart from local political ambitions, much of the differences with
Moscow arise from the desire of local areas to hang on to whatever wealth
they have for themselves at a time of great economic hardship.
This is why even areas which do not have a separate national identity, such
as oil-rich Tyumen in Siberia, or Sakhalin Island in the Far East, among the
signatories to the treaty, have also joined in the fight for more freedom
from Moscow.

FT  01 APR 92 / Ukraine to be pressed on nuclear weapons
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WHITE, Defence Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NATO ministers will today press Ukraine and other former Soviet republics
not to use their stocks of nuclear weapons for political leverage.
Concern about Ukraine's stance is expected to figure prominently at Nato
defence ministers' talks in Brussels.
Mr Pavel Grachov, Russia's deputy defence minister, said yesterday he had
told the US that the transfer of tactical nuclear weapons to Russia from
other republics would be completed by July 1, despite apparent Ukrainian
opposition.
Mr Grachov, who met Mr Dick Cheney, US defence secretary, on the eve of the
talks, said hundreds of warheads now in Ukraine, Belarus and Kazakhstan as
well as those in Russia would be stored carefully until destroyed.
The one-day meeting is the first of its kind bringing together defence
ministers from Nato and what used to be the Warsaw Pact, including 13 former
Soviet republics.
Mr Cheney said he would press for the fulfilment of pledges to place the
entire nuclear arsenal in Russia.
Tactical nuclear arms are due to be transferred to Russia by July 1 under an
agreement reached last December. Ukraine is also pledged to the removal of
strategic weapons by the end of 1994. Other strategic weapons are based in
Russia, Kazakhstan and Belarus.
The talks are also expected to focus on the share-out of the military
equipment entitlements which were allocated to the Soviet Union under the
1990 Conventional Armed Forces in Europe (CFE) treaty.

<TEXT>
A Dollars 2bn helicopter contract, for which the Franco-German Eurocopter
consortium was a leading bidder, has been put off for a month following
Turkey's row with Germany over military aid.
The Turkish defence procurement agency decided over the weekend to put off
the deal already tendered seven times. The contract was originally to
co-produce 200 multi-purpose helicopters.
However it was re-tendered in March to allow Turkey to consider the cost of
immediate delivery, amid signs of worsening security in Turkey's Kurdish
region.
The latest delay follows last week's row with Bonn over Turkey's treatment
of Kurds. Bonn suspended all aid shipments after allegations that Turkey
used German supplied armoured personnel carriers against Kurdish
demonstrators.
Turkey's fleet comprises 160 helicopters, including six Sikorsky-made Black
Hawks - the favourite to win the new contract. The government has long said
it needs a new generation of rapid deployment helicopter to counter Kurdish
insurgents in the mountainous terrain along Turkey's border with Iraq.
The urgency was underlined this weekend when Belarus was invited to display
its MI-24 HIND-D combat helicopter.

<TEXT>
FRANCE is poised for higher growth than most of its European partners this
year and next year and should be in a good position to benefit from any
upturn in the world economy, according to Mr Pierre Beregovoy, the French
finance minister.
Mr Beregovoy, who has been mooted as candidate to succeed Mrs Edith Cresson
as prime minister, said yesterday at a meeting of the Commission des Comptes
de la Nation that continuing his policy of imposing tight control on
inflation and public spending would be critical to France's growth.
The official forecast for French growth this year is 2 per cent, followed by
2.6 per cent in 1993. This, said Mr Beregovoy, would be 0.3 per cent higher
than the average growth forecast for the European economies in each of those
years.
However, private sector economists are predicting slightly lower growth
rates for France this year.
Last week economists at Paribas, one of the larger Paris investment banks,
forecast that growth for 1992 would be 1.8 per cent.
Mr Beregovoy said he expected French inflation to remain relatively low over
the next two years.
He forecast inflation of 2.8 per cent for both 1992 and 1993, beneath the
present annual rate of 3 per cent.

FT  01 APR 92 / Germany shoots itself in the foot: The political demise of
Gerhard Stoltenberg, defence minister
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By QUENTIN PEEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UNTIMELY demise of Mr Gerhard Stoltenberg, who resigned yesterday as
German defence minister, provides a graphic demonstration of the
extraordinary capacity of the German government to shoot itself in the foot.
It also reveals the terrible perils of coalition government at a time of
regional elections, the intimate relationship between domestic and foreign
policy in the federal republic, and the degree to which German foreign
policy is driven by a crusading moral fervour, regardless of the
international consequences.
If any reminder was needed, it underlines the reputation of the German
Defence Ministry as a political graveyard, from which at least four
predecessors have been forced prematurely.
Ten days ago, all was quiet in the corridors of power in Bonn. To be sure,
there was tension in the air, thanks to the imminence of two state
elections, in Baden-Wurttemberg in the south, and Schleswig-Holstein in the
north. Most of the ministers were out on the stump to whip up support either
for Mr Helmut Kohl's Christian Democratic Union, or for the minority Free
Democratic Party (FDP) of Mr Hans-Dietrich Genscher, the foreign minister.
But there was little cause for alarm, with the opposition Social Democrats
(SPD) in greater disarray.
That was before Turkish troops, using German-supplied armoured cars,
launched a new operation against Kurdish guerrillas inside the country.
Mr Genscher instantly moved to occupy the moral high ground, condemning the
action as unworthy of a Nato partner and member of the CSCE. He was backed
by Chancellor Kohl, fearful of losing electoral advantage. Turkey responded
by accusing Germany of harbouring Kurdish terrorists; Bonn retaliated by
suspending its arms supplies; President Turgut Ozal accused Bonn of tactics
reminiscent of Hitler's Germany; Chancellor Kohl responded with a furious
denial - and the whole affair was out of hand.
What happened in the meantime was that it leaked out that last year 15
Leopard tanks had been delivered to Turkey as part of a long-running
contract - after the Bundestag had ordered an embargo because of earlier the
Turkish actions against the Kurds.
That is the offence for which Mr Stoltenberg has now paid with his head. So
instead of having a useful bit of moral propaganda to woo voters in the
local polls, the government is left with a damaging deterioration in
relations with a Nato ally, and the most senior member of the cabinet has
been forced to resign in shoddy circumstances. Not only that, but the US, to
mention but one other Nato ally, is furious with Bonn for stirring up
relations with Turkey just when that country is seen as a crucial
stabilising factor in the tempestuous situation in the southern republics of
the former Soviet Union.
As for Chancellor Kohl, his CDU is left reeling because of the enforced
resignation of the one man who was expected to deliver votes in the poll in
Schleswig-Holstein - for Mr Stoltenberg is the honorary chairman and father
figure of the CDU in that state. What slim hopes the party had to make
inroads on the SPD majority there must have evaporated. It is a pretty good
tally for a small piece of moralistic diplomacy, and a row over 15 Leopard
tanks.
Mr Stoltenberg's departure removes from the German government its most
senior member, whose career in 1965 as research minister under Mr Ludwig
Erhard, and who then was successively finance minister and defence minister
in the present coalition. In between, he was prime minister in
Schleswig-Holstein.
The irony is that he was expected to quit next September, in a mid-term
reshuffle, but certainly not before the Schleswig-Holstein poll. He was the
senior Protestant in the government, representing an important constituency
in a predominantly Roman Catholic party. He is also a staunch supporter of
the Atlantic alliance, and enjoys respect second only to Chancellor Kohl in
the US.
Yet he was a lacklustre figure with a poor press. 'He does not make public
relations politics,' says Mr Jochen Thies, editor of Europa Archiv, the
foreign policy magazine. 'He is a cool north German. In this affair he is
almost helpless. He has not made bad policies, but he never sold himself
well.'

FT  01 APR 92 / Upset in Europe's construction equipment market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GERMAN reunification and recession elsewhere in Europe have transformed the
Dollars 12bn-Dollars 15bn western European construction equipment market
over the past two years, with far-reaching implications for manufacturers
and component suppliers.
Germany has more than doubled its share of the market from 18 per cent in
1989, before reunification, to 37 per cent last year, largely at the expense
of the UK, whose share has plummeted from 21 per cent to 9 per cent.
The figures come from a review by the Corporate Intelligence Group, the
London-based analyst.
In spite of a 47 per cent surge in German unit sales, overall demand in west
Europe fell 3 per cent last year to 97,358 units, confounding the group's
forecast that 1991 would be a 'watershed' with demand beginning to pick up
by the middle of the year.
A further 5 per cent decline is expected this year, and it unlikely that
demand will recover until 1993-94, says the review. Even then, sales are
expected to be 6-7 per cent lower than in the late 1980s.
The forecast provides a gloomy backdrop for next week's Bauma construction
equipment exhibition in Munich, the world's largest this year.
Demand in Germany, described by the review as 'a shining beacon of
prosperity,' is being spurred by construction activity linked to
reunification. Building activity in the west expanded slightly last year, in
spite of a second-half slowdown, while in the east the growth rate may have
reached 20 per cent.
A further 20 per cent growth in building activity is foreseen for the east
this year, but in the west the housing boom is finished, says the review.
Overall, the German construction equipment is forecast to fall to 33,510
units this year from 35,666 last year, and to 30,420 by 1996.
Even then, however, the German market will still be more than twice the size
of its three nearest rivals, France Italy and the UK.
The implications of this geographical shift in demand are fundamental, says
the review. German end-users traditionally prefer domestically-produced
equipment, and will pay a premium for the perceived additional quality.
German manufacturers have therefore been sustained by domestic demand, and
cushioned to a large extent from the severe decline in export markets.
'Unless a company has a manufacturing base, or at least an exceptionally
sound distribution network, in Germany, then manufacturers will have little
opportunity to participate in the only European market which currently
offers good volumes at acceptable margins. The result should be a much
stronger manufacturing base in Germany over the long term,' it says.
Elsewhere, the sharpest decline last year was in the 'perfectly ghastly' UK
market, where unit sales fell 38 per cent to 9,212, the lowest for at least
a decade.
The study blames 'a combination of a government fumbling its way to economic
stability, high interest rates, and too many good machines looking for too
little work.'

<TEXT>
SENIOR figures in Russian politics and industry yesterday mounted a series
of attacks on the government in the run-up to the Congress of People's
Deputies next Monday, aimed at forcing a change of the course of economic
reform. They are demanding a relaxation of credit to prevent the collapse of
industry.
The attacks came as Mr Sergei Shakhrai, a deputy prime minister and a close
aide to President Boris Yeltsin, announced his resignation.
He claimed that deputies were trying to squeeze out Yeltsin supporters from
the congress by stripping him and other ministers of their parliamentary
seats. They had used a Russian law prohibiting deputies from holding
government positions as a cover to 'exclude us all from active work at the
coming Congress . . . and thus decrease the numbers of the supporters of
Yeltsin and his reforms'.
Yesterday's attacks on government policy were from 'critical supporters' -
but showed that the constituency for the kind of radical monetary policies
which the government maintains has shrunk to virtually zero. It seems likely
that other figures may have to follow Mr Shakhrai into retirement in order
to placate the deputies. However, an announcement on Russia's admission to
the International Monetary Fund, which may come next week, would give the
government a much needed boost.
The heaviest salvo was fired by Mr Arkady Volsky, president of the Russian
Union of Industrialists, who has so far maintained a critically supportive
position towards economic reform. In an article in the daily Rabochaya
Tribuna, Mr Volsky said industry was in a parlous state, with huge unsold
stocks and vast debts. Western specialists working in the agricultural
sector fear that a lack of reform will mean a continuing deterioration, and
greater dependence on western aid. A rise in oil prices - scheduled for May
or June  - would cause 'serious upheaval', Mr Volsky said.
Admitting the need for a rise in prices to stem the uncontrolled outflow of
oil through the Baltic states at low prices, he called for a three-stage,
three-year transition to world prices.
The cause of the industrialists was further supported by Professor Yevgeny
Yasin, recently appointed as a plenipotentiary to explain the government's
economic policies to parliament. Professor Yasin, who said his slogan was
'criticise, but support', said that enterprise debts to banks and to each
other stood at Rbs600bn, against about Rbs40bn a year ago. Working capital
had fallen in real terms by 10-12 times.
'The price rises were higher, the squeeze on the money supply was stronger
and the extent of the payments crisis greater than the government expected.
There must be more flexibility on credit policy: the government must learn
that it cannot both liberalise and stabilise the currency, and that
liberalisation is now the most important thing.'
Leaders of the two separate chambers of the Russian parliament warned of
'disintegration' if economic reform continued on its present course.

Germany was treated yesterday to a taste of the abrasive style of Mrs Edith
Cresson, writes Christopher Parkes in Hanover. Beleaguered but unbowed, the
French prime minister stunned German industrialists by announcing that they
enjoy more state aid than their French counterparts.
Opening the Hanover Fair, Europe's biggest annual business show, she
launched a vigorous defence of French industrial policy as a model for the
European Community. While the Bonn government wavers on the issue, which is
pencilled into the Maastricht Treaty on economic and political union, German
industry stoutly rejected the idea. Mrs Cresson also demanded support for
Jacques Delors' call for increased EC budget contributions and more
transfers from the rich to the poorer states. This is another delicate issue
in cash-strapped Germany, which is struggling to rebuild the Eastern
economy.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Francois Mitterrand yesterday declined to announce the
widely-expected resignation of Mrs Edith Cresson as prime minister and the
formation of a new government.
Mr Mitterrand interrupted a busy ceremonial schedule to hold a series of
meetings with ministers and close political advisers. In between the
inauguration of an exhibition of Viking art, a lunch for Queen Margreth of
Denmark, and a meeting of the High Council of the Francophone countries, the
President met Mrs Cresson, after which the prime minister flew off to open
the Hanover trade fair.
French commentators are unanimous that he has no option but to replace Mrs
Cresson, after the Socialist Party's big defeats in the regional and
departmental elections on the past two Sundays.
But they also agree that the choice of a successor is critical, since Mr
Mitterrand could not change his prime minister again before the general
elections a little over a year from now. Whoever takes over now, therefore,
must be able to sustain confidence in the government, and if possible
restore a degree of popularity.
One of the few candidates capable of such a feat might be Mr Jacques Delors,
President of the European Commission, who is immensely popular in France.
But his spokesman made clear on Monday that he was committed by his present
responsibilities until the end of this year, and therefore not available.
The most noted visitor to the Elysee Palace yesterday was Mr Pierre
Beregovoy, the finance minister, who is commonly tipped as favourite to
succeed Mrs Cresson. As if to advertise the success of his economic policy
and his qualifications for promotion, Mr Beregovoy yesterday issued
optimistic new economic forecasts to the effect that the French economy
would grow by 2 per cent this year, and by 2.6 per cent next year. This, he
said, would be 0.3 percentage points higher than the European average for
both these years.
President Mitterrand also received Mr Roland Dumas, foreign minister and one
of the President's oldest associates, Mr Laurent Fabius, Socialist party
leader, and Mr Pierre Mauroy, his predecessor as party leader.
Meanwhile, the full ramifications of the defeat suffered by the Socialist
party in the regional elections ten days ago, are becoming more and more
apparent.
In the northern region of Nord-Pas-de-Calais, the Socialists' historic
fortress and one of only two regions where it previously had a governing
majority, the Socialist party was forced to concede the council leadership
to a member of the Green ecological party, as the only way to keep out the
conservatives.
An important factor was the proportional representation voting system which
ensured that the new councils would be split between many different parties,
and therefore difficult to govern.
In many cases it has proved difficult to put together governing majorities,
except through devious and opportunistic political deals which are unlikely
to provide stability. Mr Brice Lalonde, the Environment Minister and leader
of the Generation Ecologie Party, said yesterday he was so disgusted by the
manoeuvring that he would not join the next Socialist government.
In Nord-Pas-de-Calais Mrs Marie-Christine Blandin became the first woman and
the first ecologist to head a regional council; but since her Green party
group only musters eight members, compared with the 27 Socialists and 15
Communists who also voted for her, it is difficult to see how she can stay
on top.

FT  01 APR 92 / Survey of Factoring (5): Factors enter where banks fear to
tread - Big US store chains hold key to recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KAREN ZAGOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AFTER three years of watching one highly-leveraged retailer after another
file for bankruptcy protection, US factors are cautiously optimistic that
1992 may herald a return to stability.
The year started on an encouraging note, with Federated and Allied
department stores emerging from Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection from
creditors - the first big US retailers to do so successfully.
And spirits were only somewhat dampened by a bankruptcy filing by R. H. Macy
after the Christmas selling season. The big New York-based department store
chain, which was taken private in a management-led Dollars 3.6bn leveraged
buyout in 1985, had been on a shaky financial footing for several years and
the filing did not take anyone by surprise.
The fate of retailers is crucial to US factors, since factoring in the US
remains the domain of the clothing, textile and home furnishing industries.
About 80 per cent of yearly turnover comes from apparel-related businesses.
Among the services provided by factors in the US are credit-checking,
guaranteeing that credit and providing advances against accounts receivable.
Clients can choose to use any or all of these services.
The reliance on retail-related business left US factors particularly
vulnerable to a string of big department store bankruptcies, which started
with Campeau's Federated and Allied Department Stores in 1989 and may have
ended this year with RH Macy's chapter 11 filing.
But for the factors who weathered the US retail shake-up, there have been
some unexpected benefits to the upheaval which may stand them in good stead
as the economy starts to revive.
Mr Sidney Rutberg, an editor at Daily News Record and an expert on
factoring, believes that publicity over the big department store
bankruptcies actually helped some factors. Since factors provide a credit
protection service, some manufacturers started to turn to factors to protect
themselves while continuing to supply large but unstable customers.
'All the publicity about big credit losses has helped factors increase their
client-base,' says Mr Rutberg.
The recession's impact on US banking has also had a positive impact on
factors. As banks have become more wary about lending, a growing number of
mid-size businesses have turned to factoring for funds.
Indeed, 1991 was an improvement on 1990 in terms of factoring volume.
Overall industry volume rose 4.5 per cent to Dollars 51.2bn, compared with
growth of just 2.1 per cent a year earlier to Dollars 49.01bn.
During the year, Fuji Bank's Chicago-based Heller Financial overtook CIT
Group/Factoring to become the biggest US factor in terms of volume. Heller's
factoring volume climbed 8.3 per cent to Dollars 7.04bn from Dollars 6.5bn,
while CIT's improved 2.6 per cent to Dollars 6.93bn from Dollars 6.75bn.
Of the other big factors, BNY Financial, which acquired BT factors in 1990,
had static volume of Dollars 6.2bn in 1991, while Citizen's &amp; Southern
Commercial, which acquired Security Pacific Factors in 1989, saw volume grow
2.8 per cent to Dollars 5.96bn. Citizen's &amp; Southern has changed its name to
NationsBanc Commercial.
Increased exposure to bad debt has been one of the most worrying aspects of
the recession for factors. However, while the increase in 1991 volume was
somewhat offset by credit losses, Mr Rutberg says that these losses were not
disastrous and all the big US factors made money last year.
Even Republic Factors, which saw a 9.5 per cent decline in 1991 volume to
Dollars 3.8bn, is believed to have been profitable in the year. Indeed,
there have been no major factoring failures in spite of the high number of
retailing bankruptcies.
Factors started to take steps to protect themselves after the Federated and
Allied bankruptcy set off alarms about the outlook for other
highly-leveraged retailers, for whom the combination of a soft retail
environment and high interest payments might prove lethal.
Factors and retailers started to work much more closely together in the
following years. In the case of Macy, for example, a special credit
committee was set up to work with factors and review the company's financial
position.
Close relations with retailers are important, since factors cannot survive
if they refuse entirely to ship to big retailers.
'Most of the big retail bankruptcies have been telegraphed so factors were
able to ease their way down although they were not able to get out
altogether,' said Mr Rutberg. 'Factors protected themselves by charging
premiums of about 1 to 2 per cent on top of normal factoring commissions for
shipments to highly leveraged retailers such as Macy's and they also shared
the risk.'
The trend of consolidation in the industry seems to have started to slow.
The number of big factors held steady at about 17 in the last year after
dropping from 30 a few years ago.
The coming year may see some more consolidation, though at a slower pace.
There are rumours that BankBoston's factoring business is for sale, for
example. BancBoston Financial had turnover of Dollars 3.9bn last year.
Meanwhile, every small sign of economic recovery and returning consumer
confidence in the US is encouraging news for factors.

FT  01 APR 92 / Survey of Factoring (7): Potential for growth - Japan
catches on fast
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL WEINBERG
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FACTORING is a relatively undeveloped business in Japan, although turnover
more than tripled in the five years through 1991 to Dollars 17.203bn.
That was enough to make Japan the world's fifth largest factoring market. At
the same time, the economic superpower's share of global factoring activity
was a mere 6.5 per cent, suggesting there is plenty of potential for further
rapid expansion.
The relatively low turnover is partly due to the late advent of factoring in
Japan. The first specialised factoring company was established by a
financial institution in 1972 when Sanwa Bank set up the firm now known as
Sanwa Business Credit Co.
Not until 1975 did the Ministry of Finance clarify the range of activities
such bank affiliates can undertake and officially approve creation of
subsidiaries to carry out factoring as a near-banking activity.
That same year, Mitsui Bank and Mitsui &amp; Co. jointly established Japan's
second factoring firm, Mitsui Finance. Today 43 bank-affiliated factoring
companies are active, including those associated with each of the nation's
11 city, or large commercial, banks. In addition, scores of independent
non-bank financing firms offer factoring services to retailers,
manufacturers and other clients.
The difficulties faced by small and mid-sized firms in developing modern
account supervision and credit collection systems have helped foster the
industry, as have the Banking Law's limits on bank financing and credit
guarantee activities.
A distinguishing feature of Japan's factoring market is the focus on
discounting of promissory notes. Under the system, factors accept notes at a
discount from sellers of merchandise, specifying amounts, dates and
financial institutions designated to receive funds. The notes can be
purchased with or without recourse.
The transactions are appealing because of the ease of transfer and the note
holder's clear, binding rights to collect specified amounts from issuers at
maturity. The widespread use of promissory notes has fostered this type of
factoring activity, and it often takes the place of accounts receivable
financing.
Such financing is in high demand among small and mid-sized businesses and at
Shohkoh Fund &amp; Co. has expanded 40-50 per cent annually in recent years,
says company president and founder Mr Kenshin Oshima. The fast-growing
non-bank financing firm derives about one-fifth of its revenues from
promissory note discounting and another 4.5 per cent from trade accounts
factoring. It expects turnover to increase at least 20 per cent annually for
some years, Mr Oshima says.
At the same time, differences in business practices, particularly the
widespread use of promissory notes, will keep Japan's factoring market small
relative to its economy, argues Mr Takeshi Fukuda, who heads factoring
operations at Nichiboshin, a large non-banking finance company.
Promissory note discounting with recourse, in which factors handle
collection for department stores, wholesalers, retailers, car dealers and
other clients and receive payment from them, involves no direct risk from
debtor bankruptcies but yields only razor-thin margins of around 0.15 per
cent, Mr Fukuda adds.
In contrast to many other countries, cash financing of accounts receivable
is not common in Japan because of legal requirements that sellers gain
written consent from each customer before transferring collection rights to
a financing company. This is typically opposed by debtors as a sign of
distrust among sellers.
The practice frequent among trading companies of providing materials with
credit of 90 days or more also often serves a trade financing function,
while non-bank financing firms offer additional credit alternatives.
Other services provided by leading factoring firms include direct debit
collection, financing with securities and real estate collateral which banks
are often proscribed from providing, collection services and international
import-export factoring.
Over the past few years, deflation of Japan's speculative real estate and
stock market bubbles and a dramatic rise in personal and corporate
bankruptcies have vastly complicated credit assessment for all types of
factoring, says Mr Mitsuo Higashi, general manager of the international
factoring department at Diamond Factors, a member of the Mitsubishi Bank
group.
Previously, domestic bad debt rates hovered around 1 per cent. Recently they
have roughly doubled and could easily hit 3-4 per cent in the near future,
he adds.
Although starting from a small base, Japan-related international factoring
grew to Dollars 513m in 1991 from Dollars 62m five years earlier, according
to Factors Chain International. This still pushed Japan's total last year to
just 3.3 per cent of factoring worldwide.
Currently, only seven firms offer such services in Japan, including six city
bank affiliates and Hyogin Factors, a leading domestic factor set up by
Hyogo Bank of Kobe.
Prospects are bright for continued rapid expansion of the international
factoring market as trade expands and exporters move away from transacting
business via letters of credit or using export insurance. Instead, open
account sales are rapidly gaining popularity, particularly for intra-Asian
trade.
Exporters are also attracted by the ability to present copies of shipping
documents and instantly obtain 100 per cent of invoice value from banks. In
addition, large trading houses are looking to international factoring to
cover insolvency risks and as a simple means of credit protection, says Mr
Higashi.
A nine-year veteran of international factoring, Mr Higashi has responded
recently to inquiries from several affiliates of large financial
institutions keen to enter the market, where he says there is plenty of room
for everyone to expand. 'Every month we have new clients since we're
fulfilling a useful social function,' he says. 'The market is growing
quickly enough that we don't have to worry about competition.'

FT  01 APR 92 / Survey of Factoring (6): Fall-out from a scandal - Italy has
had a lively year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE word factoring has entered the Italian vocabulary during the past year
as a result of the collapse of the state Federconsorzi agricultural
organisation last May, and the subsequent failure of Banca Nazionale del
Lavoro's (BNL) Agrifactoring subsidiary.
After the scandal involving unauthorised lending to Iraq through its Atlanta
branch, Agrifactoring's failure was the last kind of news that BNL needed.
Shown in the bank's books as being its third largest factoring subsidiary,
with turnover of L2,602bn in 1990, Agrifactoring recorded factoring assets
totalling L1,446bn in its balance sheet at year-end 1990 and had liabilities
of L1,224bn towards banks and L233bn towards medium term institutions.
Through Agrifactoring and more than 20 other companies in the factoring
sector, BNL Group enjoyed clear market leadership in 1990, winning a share
of more than 43 per cent of total Italian turnover. (The Group continues to
maintain this lead position.) Its Ifitalia subsidiary, Italy's biggest
single factoring company, with turnover of L9,478bn in 1990's total market
of L71,774bn, was the first in the business in Italy when it started
operations in 1963.
But the prestige of being biggest and first has been tarnished by the
Agrifactoring affair. BNL's treatment of the liabilities of the company,
shown in its accounts as 50 per cent owned, and generally considered as
being under the Italian bank's operational control, has led to ostracism by
international banks.
Agrifactoring's assets were suddenly eroded when Federconsorzi collapsed,
and its creditors, which include big foreign banks, have been left facing
significant losses. BNL's refusal to assume the liabilities of its
Agrifactoring subsidiary has caused bad-feeling and distrust, and has led to
credit lines being cut, particularly to the Italian bank's parabanking
subsidiaries.
However, while BNL's wriggling and foot-shuffling over Agrifactoring has cut
a poor figure, causing a German banker to comment that 'Africa starts south
of the Alps', it has had no real effect on factoring business. Alessandro
Carretta, general secretary of Italy's Assifact factoring association, says,
'Agrifactoring's problems had nothing to do with factoring. It was a matter
of incorrect management.'
Indeed Italy's factoring sector continued on its upward trend in 1991,
albeit more modestly than in previous years. Depending on measurement
criteria, factoring grew last year by between 9 and 15 per cent. 'Though
this is much lower than in the 1980s when annual growth of over 30 per cent
was recorded, last year's figures show that factoring is still a growing
business,' says Mr Carretta.
The slowdown is due partly to general economic conditions in Italy, business
having been feeling the effects of recession since the end of 1990. But Mr
Carretta points to another factor that has been influencing factoring
business: legislation introduced at the beginning of last year.
'This offers advantages and disadvantages. On the plus side, there are now
safeguards toring that were formerly lacking, and the possibility of
offering new types of operation and products. But, on the other hand, the
establishment of a roll of authorised factoring firms at the Bank of Italy
and the designation of the central bank as the supervisory body may
represent a brake on development,' explains Mr Carretta.
Biagino Vismara, the executive responsible for parabanking at the Italian
banking association ABI, considers that the Bank of Italy's role as
supervisor is appropriate. The move will bring uniform treatment to
factoring companies of banking and non-bank parentage.
'The sector is now waiting for the Bank of Italy to publish its regulatory
framework,' notes Mr Vismara. One of the matters on which interest focuses
is asset ratios. Indeed, the slowdown in factoring growth may partly be due
to companies' reluctance to expand before knowing what ratios they will have
to satisfy.
Mr Carretta wonders if the introduction of asset ratios will change the
character of factoring in Italy. Captive factors, serving large industrial
groups, have been a feature of a market in which they hold a share of about
35 per cent. Will this now decline?
'Captive factors have tended to expand away from servicing group
subsidiaries to seek business among suppliers and elsewhere in the market,
but generally their asset ratios are more fragile than banks' factoring
companies,' says Mr Carretta.
Mr Vismara describes captive factors as nothing more than administrative
departments, providing just a financial service. But this basic service lies
at the origins of factoring in Italy, when credit ceilings limited lending
by banks and forced business, and the banks themselves, to other sources of
finance.
Notwithstanding the end of credit ceilings, Italian factoring has continued
to concentrate predominantly on financial aspects rather than high added
value service. 'This means that factoring customers are often now high risk
borrowers', comments a northern banker.
But the situation may be changing. Encouraged by crowding, high risk and low
profitability in Italy's domestic market, the Italian factoring subsidiary
of Barclays Bank has chosen to emphasise its capability of providing full
sales ledger management service, particularly for foreign operations. Its
global network and expertise has allowed it to take leadership in
international factoring in Italy. Others seem likely to emulate Barclays.
Both Mr Vismara and Mr Carretta predict increasing emphasis on higher
service content in factoring.

FT  01 APR 92 / Survey of Factoring (3): Handy lubricant for foreign traders
 -Export credit role is on the increase
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FACTORING has increased in popularity around the world as a means of
financing and managing export business in recent years.
Worldwide export factoring business rose by 14 per cent in 1991 compared
with an increase of just 9 per cent in domestic factoring, according to
Factors Chain International, a network of factoring companies. This was the
fifth year running that export factoring growth had exceeded that of
domestic factoring.
And there are hopes in the industry that 1992 and the formation of a single
European market, will increase demand for export factoring which allows open
account trading with foreign customers.
In spite of this trend export factoring remains only a small part of the
world total of factoring business. It amounted to only six per cent of total
factoring volume of Dollars 266bn in 1991.
Factoring has not made great headway against more established methods of
arranging export finance such as the use of letters of credit and
forfaiting, which provides for the discounting of trade bills.
It plays an important role in financing exports in Germany, Belgium and the
Netherlands, three of the leading export factoring countries, where it
amounts to about 30 per cent of total factoring volume.
But its role in other countries such as Italy and Japan, where domestic
factoring is relatively strong, is minimal.
In the UK, export factoring declined by 2.8 per cent to Pounds 601m in 1991,
in line with the decline in domestic factoring, and now accounts for just 4
per cent of total factoring volumes.
The UK factors attribute their relative lack of success in developing export
business to the important role large companies play in the country's
exports. The smaller businesses which are the factoring industry's natural
clients are not strong exporters, said Mr David Richardson, senior marketing
manager at International Factors.
Many companies have traditionally arranged export insurance cover through
the Export Credits Guarantee Department.
The sale of the ECGD's short-term export credit department to NCM of the
Netherlands may push up rates to more commercial levels and increase the
attractions of factoring finance, according to Mr Alan Hughes, managing
director of Griffin Factors.
Export factoring has also been held back by gaps in the international
networks of factoring companies.
Export factors require links with partners in export destinations to be able
to guarantee local coverage. It is the import factor who has the local
knowledge to carry out credit checks and chase invoices.
These networks have been expanding in recent years and gaps in eastern
Europe and the Far East have been plugged. South America and Africa, areas
with serious payments problems, are still to a large extent blanks on the
factoring map, however.
In spite of these limitations the failure of export factoring to make faster
progress remains something of a puzzle to the factoring industry.
All the benefits of domestic factoring apply even more strongly to export
business, where companies are even less likely to know their foreign
customers and where currency exchange rates, language and cultural
differences combine to complicate trade.

FT  01 APR 92 / Survey of Factoring (2): Beginners' bad luck - UK cash-only
business loses its shine
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FACTORING has lost much of its shine over the past 12 months for some of the
more recent arrivals. As the established firms were forecasting two or three
years ago, it has been the invoice discounting end of the market where most
of the problems have arisen.
Invoice discounting is attractive to the newcomer because it is a cash-only
service and start-up costs are low. It does not require banks of computers
and armies of clerks to administer clients' sales ledgers. But precisely
because the invoice discounter lacks the same close day-to-day contact with
his client as the full-service factor he is more vulnerable. This has led to
Schroders, the merchant banking group, shutting down its two-year old
subsidiary, Schroder Discount, while Westpac Banking Corp. has closed its
invoice discounting operation.
But it has not only been the new arrivals which have had to contend with a
hostile environment. GT Invoice Factors, a smaller company and a member of
the Association of Invoice Factors, had to close when Union Discount
Commercial Finance (UDCF), which was undergoing a reorganisation of its own,
withdrew its financial backing. GT had what is known as a 'back to back'
arrangement with UDCF for it to finance its activities.
'It was not a risk I wanted to take,' said Mr David Pretlove, managing
director of UDCF. 'It puts you at one remove from the customer. If anything
went wrong it would have been difficult to take action.'
The funding arrangement with GT was ended as part of a general overhaul of
UDCF's invoice discounting 'book'. UDCF had signed up clients for its
invoice discounting service which should have really been taken on on a
factoring basis where the controls are tighter, said Mr Pretlove.
Some of GT's clients transferred their business to Century, a subsidiary of
the Close Brothers banking group, said Mr Leslie Bland, Century's managing
director. This formed part of Century's policy of expanding by acquiring
portfolios from other factors.
Century had earlier acquired Security Pacific Business Finance (Europe) when
Security Pacific, the US banking group, decided to concentrate on its core
domestic business. Century paid Pounds 662,000 for SecPac Business Finance
in July 1991. With expected profits from the company, now renamed SP
Business Finance (Europe), of Pounds 400,000 in the first year of ownership,
Century expects to recoup its investment in 18 months.
Although it has been the invoice discounters which have been particularly
exposed to the problems caused by the recession, invoice discounting has
remained the most buoyant part of the market. Invoice discounting overtook
domestic factoring as the largest area of activity in 1989 and has remained
the largest sector ever since. In 1991 it accounted for 59 per cent of the
UK factoring market, according to the Association of British Factors and
Discounters (ABFD).
For companies which manage their exposure carefully, invoice discounting is
expected to be the major growth market. Some invoice discounters believe
that the invoice discount market will become more distinct from factoring.
This is prompted in part by a desire on the part of the invoice discounters
to distance themselves from the stigma which still attaches to factoring and
in part by the problems some discounters have had with clients they now
realise were more suitable for a full factoring service.
'The two markets will become more clearly defined,' said Mr Alan McLaren,
managing director of UCB Invoice Discounting, part of the French-owned UCB
banking group. The result of this may could well be conflicting pressures
within the ABFD, which only two years ago acknowledged the role of the
discounters in its title.
But in the meantime the large bank-owned factoring organisations continue to
provide both full-service factoring and invoice discounting side by side.
For the bank-owned factors, which make up the bulk of the industry, the most
intriguing question remains: how will their parent banks respond to the
ending of the recession?
The bank-owned factors have something of a love-hate relationship with their
parents. The factors are aware that the banks' financial standing is an
important asset to them yet they are conscious that bank managers will
retain the best lending propositions for themselves and only refer their
less than grade-A clients to their factoring arm.
Some of the factors believe the balance of power may be shifting. The large
provisions which the banks have had to make on their small business lending
may be a sign that advances to the small end of the corporate market are
better made through the factor, who has far tighter controls.
'We are seeing much better propositions come to us than we would have done a
few years ago,' commented Mr Malcolm Smith, managing director of Alex
Lawrie, part of the Lloyds Bank group.
In competing with each other, the factors can never forget that their main
rival for business is often the bank which owns them. 'I am happy having the
bank behind me but I don't want it in front of me as well,' commented one.

FT  01 APR 92 / Survey of Factoring (4): Knocked about by Norman Lamont -
Late payers become a political issue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE late payments issue has been transformed in recent months from a concern
of the small business lobbyists to a mainstream political issue in Britain.
Mr Norman Lamont, the Chancellor, announced measures aimed at speeding up
the settlement of invoices in his budget last month while the two main
opposition parties have unveiled strategies for dealing with the problem.
The factoring industry stands on the sidelines convinced, in the main, that
even if the payments performance of British business improves it will still
have a significant role to play.
Despite its refusal to change the law to improve payments behaviour, the
government acknowledges that the problem is a major one for business.
British companies wait on average 72 days for payment, 42 days longer than
the terms they normally write into contracts. The cost of financing these
delays eats up half of the average businesses pre-tax profit, which itself
is only 4 per cent of sales, the government calculates.
The government believes that payments performance will not be improved by
the introduction of an automatic right to charge interest on overdue
business debts - a scepticism shared by many factors  - though its policy of
exhortation appears to have failed dismally.
It has therefore opted for a series of less far-reaching measures. In his
March budget the chancellor said he would:
Require large companies to state in their annual report and accounts how
quickly they pay their bills. Up to 9,000 companies could be affected
according to the Companies Act definition of 'large': sales of more than
Pounds 8m; a balance sheet of more than Pounds 3.9m and 250 employees.
Simplify procedures for dealing with small claims and debt recovery cases in
the courts. This will include dispensing with preliminary hearings in small
claims cases; allowing judges to help litigants who do not have legal
representation; and allowing claimants to be represented in court by someone
who is not a lawyer.
Make prime contractors to government departments include a clause in their
agreements with sub-contractors to pay them promptly: usually within 30 days
of receiving a valid invoice.
These measures were welcomed by business groups though they did not go as
far as some had hoped. The Federation for Small Businesses had been pressing
for the courts to take automatic responsibility for enforcing debt payment
judgments. At present plaintiffs must return to the court for a payment
order if the defendant does not pay up.
There is also some doubt about the ability of government to insist on prime
contractors paying sub-contractors within 30 days when, according to some
small business lobbyists, the payments record of government has worsened.
But discussion of these issues will be academic if the Conservatives are not
returned to power. Both Labour and the Liberal Democrats have promised
legislation to give businesses the automatic right to interest on overdue
debts.
The Liberal Democrats want companies to be required to make a provision in
their accounts for any interest liability. This is intended to shame larger
companies into adopting better payment practices.
But even if these measures were brought in and businesses began paying more
promptly there is likely to remain plenty of work for the factors to do. If
a statutory right to interest were to be introduced the factors could play a
role in collecting that interest.

FT  01 APR 92 / Survey of Factoring (1): Time for a fresh image - Factoring
companies, whose function is to speed the cash flow of other businesses, are
as vulnerable to the recession as many of their customers. But while
factoring has flagged in some countries, other markets have shown surprising
growth
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
IF anyone in the factoring industry had believed that it was immune to
recession, the past 12 months will have dispelled that illusion. Bad debts
and fraud have slashed millions of pounds from its profits.
Three of the smaller players withdrew from the market but even some of the
larger, well-established groups have received a severe bruising. As it is,
the casualty figure was restricted to GT Invoice Factors, a small, though
long-established company, and two recent entrants, Schroders and Westpac
Banking Corp. GT was forced to stop taking on new business when its
financial backer withdrew support while Schroders and Westpac decided to
wind down their factoring operations because of the tough trading
conditions.
But in spite of the gloom, the factors and invoice discounters believe that
the end to the recession - when it comes - will give them their chance to
become a mainstream financing mechanism for business.
'Factoring will benefit from the attention which is being focused on the
issue of late payments and the banks' caution about lending to smaller
companies,' said Mr Alan Hughes, chairman of the Association of British
Factors and Discounters (ABFD) and managing director of Griffin Factors
(part of Midland Bank).
Whether this ambition is realised will depend on the industry dispelling
what remains of its negative image for financing businesses in trouble. It
will also require marketing managers to devise a vocabulary for the industry
which has a stronger appeal to potential customers.
Factoring is not a term which means much to many businessmen and women.
Kellock decided to label its service as 'cashflow finance' after a survey
showed many businessmen and accountants did not grasp the role of factoring.
Thirdly, the bank-owned factors may have to devise ways of integrating their
factoring and banking services more closely. Allied Commercial Finance, part
of Allied Irish Bank, says it is developing a hybrid financing product.
In the short-term, though, the industry will be seeking to recover from its
worst year for a decade. UK industry statistics compiled by the ABFD,
representing 11 of the largest companies in the business, showed growth of
just 2.5 per cent in the turnover of companies serviced by its members to
Pounds 14.2bn last year.
This compares with a 14 per cent increase in 1990 and growth rates in the 25
per cent range in the late 1980s. This slow rate of increase was solely due
to a 6.5 per cent rise in invoice discounting to Pounds 8.4bn with both
domestic and export factoring recording falls of 2.8 per cent, their first
declines since 1981/82.
The much smaller companies which make up the Association of Invoice Factors
(AIF) fared slightly better. The nine members of the AIF reported a 12 per
cent increase in business volume to Pounds 251m last year but this had
little impact on the overall level of activity.
The slow down in the UK, the world's third largest factoring market, was
mirrored elsewhere. Worldwide, factoring companies did Dollars 260bn worth
of business in 1991, a 9 per cent increase compared with a 29 per cent rise
the year before, according to Factors Chain International, a network of
companies in 34 countries. Business volumes stagnated in some of the larger
markets but strong growth was recorded in Mexico, Spain, South Korea and
Denmark.
The UK industry's hopes of an upturn when the recession lifts are based on
the flexibility which factoring and invoice discounting offer businesses.
Unlike a bank loan or even an overdraft a factoring facility grows in line
with turnover.
Once a bank manager has lent up to what he considers is a prudent level,
taking into account the assets which a business can provide as security, he
can usually go no further. In the present economic climate few bank managers
will lend more than 40 to 50 per cent of the value of invoices and this
figure may go as low as 25-30 per cent for less than first class debtors.
A factor, in contrast, will normally pay up to 80 per cent of the value of
invoices immediately, with the remainder, minus his fee and interest
charges, following when his client's customer pays up. Unlike a bank loan or
overdraft, which will have to be renegotiated as the business grows, a
factoring facility increases with sales.
In addition to handling his client's sales ledger and advancing cash against
invoices, a factor will, if required, arrange for credit insurance.
There are, however, a number of potential pitfalls. The bank may want to
reduce its lending if a business assigns security over its debtors to a
factor; businesses on fine margins may find the fees too high; and some
customers may react badly if they have a negative view of factoring.
For larger, more well established companies, invoice discounting is more
appropriate. The client retains control of his sales ledger and only makes
use of the cash-in-advance service.
Invoice discounting is a riskier business for the factor/invoice discounter
because he is not so closely involved in his client's affairs.
Clients may be tempted to send in invoices before the goods are shipped,
create completely bogus 'fresh air' invoices or hang on to customer payments
which should have been passed on to the invoice discounter.
'The invoice discounters have been badly hit by frauds and losses,'
commented Mr Nick Sanders, business development director of County Factors.
One result of this has been for the invoice discounters to reassess their
client lists and move some invoice discounting clients over to a factoring
service.
Union Discount Commercial Finance, formerly known as Union Discount
Commercial Finance, staged a relaunch last October after running into
problems with some of its clients. 'We had companies we should have been
factoring, not invoice discounting,' said Mr David Pretlove, who was brought
in as managing director to resolve the difficulties. 'We have tidied up our
book and carried out a major reorganisation,' he said.
Union Discount will continue to concentrate on invoice discounting but is
being more selective in its choice of clients. It is targeting companies in
the Pounds 1m-Pounds 15m range and plans to raise invoice discounted
turnover to Pounds 750m over two years from Pounds 200m at the time of the
relaunch.
Even when companies have avoided frauds, their margins have come under
pressure from the tougher business climate. Existing clients have expanded
their sales more slowly while new clients have often been outnumbered by
clients going out of business. As new clients represent a cost rather than a
profit in the first year the performance of many factors has declined.
There seems little doubt, however, that there will be a continuing demand
for the factoring industry's services since the problem of the late payment
of debts appears to be worsening rather than easing. Despite exhortation
from the government and the promise, in last month's budget, of a reform of
court procedures for collecting debts, demand for the debt collection
services of factors seems set to grow.
Even the prospect, however remote, of a government introducing legislation
to give suppliers an automatic right to claim interest on overdue payments
does not appear to worry the industry. 'I don't think legislation would
help,' said Mr John Davies, marketing director of Alex Lawrie, a Lloyds Bank
subsidiary. 'There has to be a change in the business culture and in the
credit control systems companies use.'
If legislation were brought in, this would be to the long-term benefit of
the factoring industry, according to Mr Hughes of the ABFD. 'In some
industries there will always be a delay between a company paying its
suppliers and getting paid itself. 'If legislation reduces the vulnerability
of companies to late payments then we are in favour. It is short-sighted to
say that legislation would reduce the need for factoring.'
There is certainly scope for the factoring industry to increase its market
share. A recent survey by the Confederation of British Industry found only 2
per cent of companies polled had used a factor. The factors and invoice
discounters currently serve about 12,000 UK companies. Alex Lawrie's Mr
Davies estimates that the number of businesses with cash flow problems which
would meet the factors criteria at 150,000 while the ABFD's Mr Hughes puts
the figure as high as 250,000.
If the banks maintain their cautious policies on lending to small firms the
potential for factoring is enormous. But realising that potential will
require a huge effort on the part of the industry to 'sell' its advantages
to a still sceptical market place.
