THE LOVER (18) MGMs West End
PARADISE (12) MGMs West
AUTOBUS (15) Renoir
HOMEWORK (18) Metro
STONE COLD (18) Odeon Marble ArchThe onslaught of saucy TV advertisements
and rumours of actual on-camera sex seem to suggest that The Lover is going
to be this season's sophisticated erotic offering, a legitimate skinflick on
a par with Betty Blue or Last Tango in Paris. In the event, the film proves
to be a strangely staid and uninvolving experience. Based on Marguerite
Duras's bestselling novel, it tells the story of an impoverished 15-year-old
French girl (Jane March) who enters into an affair with a wealthy,
32-year-old Chinese (Tony Leung) in 1930s Vietnam. They meet on a barge
crossing the Mekong River and are soon spending afternoons making prolonged
love in his bachelor pad in the city's noisy, exotic Cholon district.
Despite the intense intimacy of these sessions, it soon becomes clear that
their relationship is doomed by the mutual racism of their families and the
unbridgeable chasm between their cultures.
Director Jean-Jacques Annaud has stretched Duras's brief novel into a big,
sumptuous picture, beautifully shot and impeccable in its detailed evocation
of colonial Vietnam. When he trains his camera on the swollen Mekong River
or the tattily sprawling colonial buildings of old Saigon, you get a real
sense of what the last days of that particular empire must have looked and
sounded like. He also draws a convincing portrait of the girl's rancorous,
dissolving family, hating one another yet forced by their poverty and
foreign status to cling together. Most notable here is Arnaud Giovaninetti
as the dissolute eldest son, particularly when he mocks his mother's tears
as the boat taking him home in disgrace leaves harbour.
Where the film proves sorely lacking is its depiction of the central
relationship. Despite the graphically sweaty love scenes and those
languorous silences in the back of limousines, the affair between the
unnamed French girl and Chinese man fails to ignite. Annaud and co-writer
Gerard Brach seem to think that writhing nudity in some way excuses the
cool, detached banality of the clothed scenes. As a result, you never really
feel the risk and passion involved as the lovers break cultural taboos. They
are just a couple having lots and lots of sex. To make matters worse, March
proves unable to evoke her character's simultaneous sexual and moral
awakenings, the very qualities that made Duras' novel so memorable. She
seems old beyond her years before the affair even begins, a sort of
petulantly pubescent Emmanuelle. The Lover is like its heroine, nice to look
at but hard to like.
Paradise is an oddly palatable serving of cinematic syrup. It tells the
story of a 10-year-old boy (Elijah Wood) who is sent from his big city,
single-parent home to spend the summer in the southern coastal town of
Paradise. At first, the place seems unlikely to live up to its name, with
his host couple (Don Johnson and Melanie Griffith) going through a decidedly
rough marital patch engendered by the accidental death of their own son a
few years back. Gradually, however, the boy, who has problems of his own
with his father's recent abandonment, proves a salve for everybody's psychic
wounds.
It is not hard to see how this sort of coming-of-age, coming-to-terms saga
could have gone disastrously wrong, especially as it emanates from that
bottomless well of sentimentality, Disney's Touchstone Pictures. But
writer/director Mary Agnes Donoghue manages to keep things pretty well under
control, using low-key humour and a nicely wistful pace to avoid bludgeoning
the viewer's sensibilities. She is greatly aided by the impressive Wood, as
well as by Griffith and Johnson, who turn in handsome and restrained
performances. Only with a needless sub-plot involving tomboy Thora Birch and
her wayward father does the film go over the top.
A very different form of sentimentality is at work in Autobus, a witty and
anarchic look at youthful alienation, French style. It tells the story of a
young man (Yvan Attal) who decides to hitch a ride to see his girlfriend. He
accomplishes this by the rather unorthodox step of hijacking a bus loaded
with school children in what turns out to be a weird attempt to impress the
girl with his devotion. Quickly dubbed 'The Sentimental Terrorist' by the
press, he eludes the police for nearly two days before finally reaching his
goal, winning over along the way the bus's kids, tough guy driver and
supervising teacher.
Despite the rather improbable subject matter, writer/director Eric Rochant
has created a funny, charming story that pokes fun at itself without
undermining its feeling. As with his fine first film, A World Without Pity,
Rochant pulls of the nearly impossible stunt of being a full-blown romantic
without giving in to corniness or pretension.
Homework, by the Mexican director Jaime Humbert Hermosillo, is a clever
piece of celluloid wit that will probably only appeal to the pasty souls who
haunt arthouse cinemas. Set entirely in the study of a small apartment, it
shows the efforts of Virginia (Maria Rojo) to complete an assignment for her
film class, which seems to involve making an hour's worth of uncut
documentary footage. To do this, she hides her camera under the table and
then invites over an ex-boyfriend (Jose Alonso) with the intention of taping
her seduction of him - without his knowledge. He spots the camera and storms
off just before they graduate from heavy petting, only to return a short
while later, his interest and male vanity piqued.
More a cunningly ironic essay on cinematic voyeurism than a full blooded
film, Homework proves too slight to carry the viewer the distance, even with
the twist ending. It is notable primarily for a sequence of sexual
gymnastics in a hammock which would make the leads in The Lover blush and
seems to indicate that the Mexico has yet to ratify the Law of Gravity.
The makers of Stone Cold seem intent on suspending other laws, such as those
governing commonsense and decency. The story, such as it is, concerns a
renegade cop (Brian Bosworth) who infiltrates a Mississippi motorcycle gang
to bring them to justice. He succeeds, but only after they massacre the
entire Mississippi Supreme Court, which does not seem like much of a victory
for the forces of good. Bosworth is a former American Football star with a
face right out of Marvel Comics and a body that looks like 15 stone of
bleached beef. The film ends up nothing more than a pacey bloodbath in which
motorcycles, naked women and gunshot wounds are served up with equal
dispassion.

FT  18 JUN 92 / Accountancy Column: Mid-size marriage of convenience may set
trend
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A RATHER unusual volume sits among the untouched tomes on international tax
treaties and accounting for leases on the Financial Times's bookshelves. In
the last few days, with the announcement of a merger between Stoy Hayward
and Finnie's, two mid-sized firms, its spine has lost the normal covering of
dust.
The casual reader is in for a surprise when browsing through the book for
the first time. Inside the glossy red cover, emblazoned with favourable
reviewers' comments, the contents leave something to be desired, being
nothing but blank white pages. Only on re-reading the title, does it click:
for this is 'The Stoy Hayward Guide to Mergers in the Accountancy
Profession', published as a joke in 1989, when many rival firms were in the
midst of intensive discussions on coming together.
Stoy, in contrast, had remained resolutely independent and aloof from the
trend since its previous 'merger' back in 1974. Even then, it only took in a
two-partner practice. Over the next 15 years it resolutely refused to
entertain any further such activity.
For afficianados of the new Stoy merger now underway, there are several
additional ironic twists to the firm's book beyond the title and its lack of
content. Its authors are John Piper - one of the partners brought in with
his practice in 1974 - and Adrian Martin, the current managing partner, who
was central to the merger with Finnie this month.
One of the comments from a 'reviewer' on the back page - who says, 'We are
proud to have been involved as sponsors for the research material in this
excellent book' - is by Douglas Llambias, a consultant and professional
matchmaker among accountants, who helped bring the two firms together over
the last few months.
But what Finnie's and Stoy's partners might be more nervous about today is
the description of the contents printed inside the dust jacket of the book.
The 'guide', it says, tongue firmly in cheek, demonstrates how to reach the
right decision 'without being confused by non-important factors such as
money'. Mergers, it argues, are being driven by rising rents and an
anticipated shortage of good partners. They allow successful firms to
achieve key features of their strategic plans. But the pitfalls are usually
only discovered once they are perpetrated.
The two sets of partners might be slightly uneasy at that particular jibe,
but they cannot disagree entirely with its analysis.
It would be too easy to dismiss the Stoy-Finnie link-up as another merger on
uncomfortable terms. So many others in the last few years have been driven -
despite the rhetoric of 'strategic reasons' - by the inherent weaknesses of
at least one of the two firms involved, saddled perhaps with expensive
potential litigation, high debts or a declining practice area.
Now, with the impact of the recession far deeper, and competition between
firms for clients so intense, for Stoy to merge is surely a way to boost its
income. Finnie has several tempting quoted clients it could take on board,
including the Body Shop. Equally, as critics have not been slow to point
out, Stoy gained a reputation as something of a whizz-kid firm during the
1980s, becoming auditors to several high-profile companies now in disgrace,
such as the Levitt Group and Polly Peck International.
Perhaps the merger gives the firm a chance to redeem itself with a broader
portfolio of safer clients. Several factors veer away from such a purely
negative spin on the merger, however. The most significant is the fact that
Finnie approached Stoy, not the other way round. Stoy is believed to have
turned down a number of merger approaches over the last decade. Finnie was
the only one that ever got to an advanced stage of discussions, and it
claims that Stoy was its first choice among three attractive candidates.
That choice only came after a detailed scrutiny, under confidentiality
agreements, of documents including the partnership accounts, information on
litigation and the technical working papers surrounding some of the more
controversial audits.
Similarly, if Stoy only wanted to gain clients, it would have to swallow the
extra overheads of additional Finnie professionals, since at least on paper
the new, enlarged firm claims there will be no significant job losses. If
senior staff are removed in the coming months, that could also jeopardise
the relationship with existing clients and risk them moving elsewhere.
In spite of these arguments, it is, of course, possible that Finnie rather
than Stoy needed to merge in order to survive. As the twentieth largest firm
by fee income, it is no doubt suffering a squeeze on business, partly
generated by aggressive tendering by some of its larger competitors.
All the two firms will say - ambiguously - is that their profits are at
about the same level. They do not deny that a larger client base was among
the most attractive aspects of the merger. They also state that the combined
firm is profitable, with low gearing and a strong balance sheet.
But Mr Adrian Martin also makes a point of stressing that Stoy was attracted
by the fact the merger would have little impact on the firm's position as
number eight by size. The two firms suggest that their cultures and
approaches to the provision of professional services are compatible.
Whatever the truth in these arguments, there does certainly appear to be
some strategic logic behind the merger, which was not always so clear in
previous examples. Stoy is a London-based partnership, with associates
around the country. For several years it has been considering how to expand
from its West End office into the south-east. Finnie is essentially a
south-eastern practice, which has built up a network of 10 offices in the
M25 region around London. Its local strength makes it very attractive as a
way for Stoy to expand in the area. At the same time, Stoy recognised a
number of strong aspects of Finnie's operations that tied in with its own
strengths: in insolvency, property work and corporate finance including work
on the government's Business Expansion Scheme.
Finnie makes no secret of the fact that it was finding it difficult coping
with clients with operations outside the south-east. Without the nationwide
network it now has, it was forced to refer these clients to independent
accountancy practices in other parts of the country.
How well the merger will last over time, in terms of both client and staff
retention, cannot yet be judged. There has already been modest fall-out: Mr
Chris Benbow, former senior partner at Finnie and a man intimately involved
in the early discussions, left 'to pursue other interests' a few weeks ago.
Finnie's Beverley office also remains outside the new network of associates
around the UK.
What seems certain is that the shake-out of mid-size firms is far from over.
While different types of clients have different needs, the number of firms
of similar size offering comparable services is probably unsustainable in
such a competitive environment.
Whatever the reasons, the number of mergers and acquisitions does not seem
likely to diminish. A recent survey by Michael Page, financial recruitment
consultants, suggested that a growing proportion of small practices
anticipate selling out or merging. Last month, Ernst &amp; Young announced the
acquisition of a 12 per cent stake in Kalchas, a small strategic consultancy
firm. Another merger involving mid-size firms is rumoured to be announced
shortly.
The reasons for this activity may all be different, but the trend is the
same. In another year, partners in Stoy Hayward may still be evaluating the
success of the merger. But the pages of a second edition of the Stoy guide
in two years's time could be somewhat more detailed.

FT  18 JUN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Mirror cracks as the Left regards
its voters - A look at the fallout from a fourth election defeat
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE tedious, acrimonious and wholly irrelevant row over who exactly was
responsible for what during Labour's election campaign is acting like a
lorry load of sand delivered to the party's Walworth Road headquarters.
As the 32-member national executive committee gathers to conduct its
election post mortem today, there is every danger that it will take the
ostrich option and bury its head in it. At the centre of the row is the role
played by Labour's Shadow Communications Agency - its polling, advertising
and image-making arm - and other sundry political advisers drafted in for
the campaign.
As the game of pass the parcel has speeded up, a leaked report by Mr Jim
Parish, a key organiser, has attributed many of the failures of the campaign
to the 'wholesale takeover' of day-to-day strategy by this unelected
inner-core group.
That the SCA, headed by Mr Phillip Gould, and others such as Ms Patricia
Hewitt, a former Kinnock aide, played a central role in the conduct of
election is indisputable. It is arguable, too, that the more worldly
experience of professional politicians might have been brought more heavily
to bear.
But all that does not mesh well with the conclusion of party workers on the
morning of April 9 that Labour had surpassed even its 1987 effort and fought
its best campaign ever.
To his credit, Mr Larry Whitty, the party's general secretary, has been
scrupulous in refusing to join the search for scapegoats. His official
report eschews all buck-passing and tells a more convincing story.
Far more significant than the role of the SCA, the Jennifer's Ear affair,
the Sheffield rally or Mr John Smith's tax plans was the 'general distrust'
felt by voters of the party and its leadership.
The report goes on to show an extraordinary haemorraging of support for
Labour in the last few days of the campaign. On the important 'economic
competence' question, for example, Labour saw its position slip from about
even with the Conservatives to an 18 percentage point deficit in the last
three days alone.
A post-election, qualitative survey of 'swing' voter groups appears to have
borne that out. Its findings were that Labour was regarded as old-fashioned,
tied to the past, and unduly linked to minority interests, not least the
trade unions.
But as this research was conducted by the widely disparaged SCA, some NEC
members, such as Ms Clare Short MP, have cast doubt on its veracity. 'They
would say that, wouldn't they,' she commented on Tuesday.
Yet other senior party figures also broadly subscribe to Mr Whitty's
alarming view that it is the product itself - not the promotional glitz -
that remains Labour's core problem. Mr David Hill, the party's
communications chief, in his own paper to the NEC agrees with Mr Neil
Kinnock himself that it is the historical baggage left over from the 1970s
and 1980s that continues to undermine Labour's election chances.
Many new Labour MPs concur that it is indeed that public image - Labour's
very identity - that is the central question.
In a cogent newspaper article this month, Mr Tony Wright, MP for Cannock,
has said that the party must now tackle the traditional no-go areas. It must
dump its 'ancestral commitment to a publicly owned economy', acknowledge a
new European social democratic identity and confront head-on a wholesale
reform of its constitution.
However, he appears dubious as to whether that is really achievable. 'In a
remarkable transformation,' he wrote, 'as the Conservatives have acquired a
radical identity, so Labour has become the conservative party.'
Today's NEC's inquest coincides with the publication of the first
comprehensive study of Labour's activists. To the surprise of some, this
analysis of more than 5,000 party members has found some remarkable
disparities between Labour members and voters.
Of the former, for example, some 75 per cent are owner-occupiers and nearly
half are designated of the 'salariat' - against 14 per cent of Labour voters
 -with just 26 described as working class (57).
Similarly, there is clear confirmation that the party's vanguard stands well
to the left of Labour voters on a number of important issues. On public
ownership, some 71 per cent of members believe in more nationalisation,
against 38 per cent of Labour voters.
If, as the authors Mr Patrick Seyd and Mr Paul Whiteley conclude, the
membership is 'socially unrepresentative' of Labour voters in significant
ways, how much more are its views politically unrepresentative of the
country as a whole?
Both Mr Whitty's and Mr Wright's analyses appear tacitly to acknowledge, if
not publicly endorse, the voters' perception of the party as both outdated
and out of touch.
There are no guarantees the predominately salaried, middle-aged, home-owning
and male arch-activists meeting today on the NEC will agree.
With Labour's leadership election firmly focused on party members as opposed
to the voters' at large, a radical debate has been shut down and old
prejudices reinforced - at least until the contest's conclusion on July 18.
As Mr Bryan Gould, candidate for both leader and deputy leader, put it in a
bitter speech this week, Labour's election inquest is in danger of becoming
'hunt the scapegoat'.
'If winning inner party elections becomes more important than devising ways
of winning general elections,' he said, 'Labour is in deep trouble.' The
danger is that to win the former, candidates must make their pitch to an
electorate whose views bear little relation to those of the voters' at
large.

FT  18 JUN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Labour poll row flares again
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE open warfare over responsibility for Labour's election defeat flared
again last night when Mr John Prescott repeated claims that the campaign had
been hijacked by outsiders.
The transport spokesman's charges were described as 'complete rubbish' by Mr
Jack Cunningham, the party's campaigns co-ordinator.
Mr Prescott, in his criticism of the campaign, complained that despite being
a member of the shadow cabinet and the NEC he had to 'peer in on television
to see who was on the campaign strategy team and who was making decisions'.
But Dr Cunningham hit back in an interview immediately afterwards, saying:
'It comes ill from people who were a member of two, or even all three, of
those bodies to say now they didn't know what strategy was being laid down.'
He insisted there were regular presentations to the shadow cabinet, the
campaign strategy committee and to the NEC for months before the general
election.
He added: 'At all times in the campaign the decisions were taken in the
campaign management team which I chaired, and to suggest that a small group
of people tried to subvert or circumvent those decisions is complete
rubbish.'
Ms Patricia Hewitt, a former aide to Mr Neil Kinnock, also counter-attacked
against the 'huge cowardice' of people refusing to take responsibility for
collective leadership decisions.
Last night, Mr Stan Orme, Labour MP for Salford East, announced that he
would not be seeking re-election as chairman of the parliamentary Labour
party.

FT  18 JUN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Euro MPs press over Maastricht
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TORY MEPs yesterday increased the pressure on Mr John Major to tackle
opposition to Maastricht by adding a protocol that would ensure decisions
are made at the lowest possible level of government.
At an hour-long meeting at Downing Street, the members of the European
parliament supported the prime minister's determination to press ahead on
ratification of the treaty. But they urged him to work for a 'Citizen's
Europe', based on greater decentralisation.
Sir Christopher Prout, leader of the Tory MEPs, said Mr Major had been
'upbeat' about the delegation's proposals for a Citizen's Charter for
Europe.
The MEPs were also anxious to make an early start on ensuring a positive
message by Tories in the 1994 European elections - in contrast to the
party's poor performance in 1989.
Sir Christopher said the UK government, in its presidency of the EC from
next month, ought to carry through the idea ministers have floated of a
protocol reinforcing the principle of 'subsidiarity'.
It was winning support in the European parliament, he said.
A protocol would have to be binding on all EC members, even though that
would require a technical negotiation of the treaty, Sir Christopher said.
He suggested that work on the protocol would not need to start until the 11
countries, other than Denmark, had ratified the treaty.
Sir Christopher reiterated Mr Major's pledge to put Britain at the heart of
Europe, in spite of the row over Maastricht. 'If we just stand aside, it
will become the thing we most fear - a centralised Europe,' he said.
The meeting counter-balanced pressure on Mr Major from Conservative
Euro-sceptics in the Commons, highlighting the spread of views across the
party.

FT  18 JUN 92 / Victorian paintings sale flops: Saleroom
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SOTHEBY'S has decided to change the way it sells Victorian pictures because
of a very disappointing sale of such paintings yesterday.
A few years ago, Sotheby's placed British 19th-century art in the same
auctions as Continental 19th-century art, in the hope of building up an
international market. That has not materialised, and yesterday a whole
series of paintings and drawings by Rossetti, Burne-Jones, Millais, Lord
Leighton and others failed to sell.
In future such works will be removed from 19th-century European auctions and
returned to their own specialist catalogue.
Top price yesterday, in a sale that totalled Pounds 1.325m, with 33 per cent
unsold, in the morning session, was Pounds 473,000 for 'Inferno 1901' by
August Strindberg. A work by another Swedish artist, Anders Zorn, 'Dalaro
1892', showing a nude dipping her toe in the sea, sold for Pounds 165,000.
A good example of the distance between the 1988 art market highs and the
1992 art market lows was provided at Phillips on Tuesday by two George II
chimneypieces which had been removed from Northumberland House in the Strand
when it was demolished in 1874. Four years ago they sold for Pounds 200,000
and Pounds 115,000 respectively at Christie's. This week they sold at
Phillips for Pounds 71,520 and Pounds 38,775. The buyer in 1988 had been the
now bankrupt Asil Nadir; the sellers on Tuesday were the administrators of
Polly Peck International, the conglomerate of which Mr Nadir was chairman.

FT  18 JUN 92 / Factory output up 1% over quarter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE 0.3 per cent rise in manufacturing output in April continued an upward
trend that began in February and was broadly based across manufacturing's
seven sectors.
The monthly increase meant that growth in the three months to April was 1
per cent up compared with the previous three-month period, although compared
with a year ago it was 1 per cent lower.
The Central Statistical Office said the highest growth was in metals and the
sector known as 'other manufacturing', which includes plastics, paper and
publishing.
Every component of the consumer goods industries experienced growth, with
the sector overall growing by 1.6 per cent in the quarter to April. The most
marked improvement was in the production of cars, up 9 per cent on the
previous quarter. Clothing and footwear grew by 2.6 per cent.
Within engineering, which counts for over 40 per cent of manufacturing,
output of motor vehicles rose by 7.3 per cent in the three months to April.
Mechanical engineering fared less well, falling by 1 per cent, while
aerospace and shipbuilding contracted by 2.9 per cent on the previous
quarter. The chemicals and man-made fibres industry continued to thrive
although the 0.2 per cent three month on three month growth was the lowest
for a year. A buoyant pharmaceuticals industry meant that chemicals and
artificial fibres had the strongest annual growth - almost 4 per cent.
A sharp fall in North Sea oil and gas production in March meant that overall
energy output to April was 2 per cent down on the previous quarter.

TAKE-UP of the government's pilot 'training credits' scheme for young people
has fallen below target in its first year, a Department of Employment
evaluation has found.
About 60 per cent of eligible trainees aged between 16 and 17 have started
to use their credits, compared with the government's original target of 65
per cent for the first 12 months of the scheme.

FT  18 JUN 92 / Funds to charities remain stable
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TYPICAL support for charity averaged Pounds 2 a person a month in 1990-91,
according to research published by the Charities Aid Foundation yesterday,
Alan Pike writes.
That was an improvement on the previous year - when typical monthly giving
fell to Pounds 1.28 - but the figures disguise the fact that the most
philanthropic section of the population donated 'substantially less' while
small givers supplied a little more.
As a result, total public support for charity was unchanged last year at
between Pounds 3.5bn and Pounds 4.3bn.
The research, conducted for the foundation by Manchester University, shows
that 24 per cent of the population donate nothing, while most of the 76 per
cent of donors confine their support to relatively modest levels.
The government wants the voluntary sector to take over an increased range of
services from public agencies, but the survey shows strong support for
continued state provision. A total of 90 per cent of respondents agreed that
the government had a basic responsibility to take care of people, with 86
per cent saying that the government should help more and not rely on
charities.

FT  18 JUN 92 / Patchy signs of recovery in Midlands
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PATCHY signs of recovery have appeared in the regional economy of the West
Midlands, traditionally the heart of British manufacturing industry.
Meanwhile, the immediate prospects for growth in employment remain dismal
and the rate at which companies are introducing new products has dropped
sharply.
Those points emerge today from a survey of more than 1,400 companies across
the region, carried out in May when there was high corporate optimism after
the general election result.
Of the companies surveyed, 66 per cent expect the business climate to
improve over the next six months. Such optimism is offset, however, by the
fact that nearly half the companies are still reporting falls in profits and
sales. The element of recovery is contained in the fact that this is a lower
proportion than at any time since winter 1990.
Analysis of the survey shows that improved profitability and sales have
occurred most strikingly in the services sector. In manufacturing, capacity
utilisation remains, as it has done for the past year, at under 90 per cent
for more than three quarters of companies, and the volume of export sales
has remained unchanged for the past six months.
The recovery of the services sector sets the West Midlands apart from south
England, where the sector has borne the brunt of the recession.
Nevertheless, doubts remain about whether the West Midlands services
recovery can be sustained without a concomitant improvement in
manufacturing.
Although only 13 per cent of companies expect to shed labour, while 33 per
cent expect to take on people, the survey concludes: 'There is little
prospect of overall employment increasing over the next six months.'
Previous surveys have shown that companies have tended to underestimate the
scale of future redundancies.
Longer-term development of the West Midlands economy might be held back by a
fall over the past six months in investment on new technology and by
slippage in the rate at which new products are being introduced.
In summer 1990, 45 per cent of companies had introduced a new product within
the previous six months but now the proportion has slipped to 25 per cent.
Moreover, 28 per cent of companies have either cut their training budget or
have spent nothing on training over the past six months.

Business School in conjunction with Warwick Business School and Price
Waterhouse. Wolverhampton Business School, Compton Park, Compton Road West,

FT  18 JUN 92 / House buyers' confidence 'fragile'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INQUIRIES from prospective home buyers have risen but sales are taking a
long time to complete and many would-be purchasers pull out at the last
minute, according to a survey of more than 100 estate agents published
today.
The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors' survey says: 'Despite
increasing levels of buyer interest across the country, we are still a long
way from any sustained improvement in the housing market.'
Many estate agents appealed to the government to extend the moratorium on
stamp duty. They fear that there will be a rush to beat the deadline of
August 19 when the temporary suspension of duty on house sales below Pounds
250,000 is due to end, after which sales may fall sharply.
Mr Peter Miller, housing spokesman for the institution, said: 'The upward
trend of improvement in the residential market is apparent. However, fears
regarding job security and local economic factors can easily knock the
fragile confidence of buyers. The high level of abortive sales is
manifestation of unease in the market.'
The institution said that a reduction in the number of repossessed homes for
sale had eased pressures on the market.
The survey asked estate agents in England and Wales whether house prices had
moved during the three months to the end of May. More than 73 per cent said
prices did not change, about a quarter said prices fell and 1.1 per cent
said prices rose.

FT  18 JUN 92 / Export insurer quells fears of price war
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID DODWELL, World Trade Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A PRICE WAR over export credit in the UK has to be avoided, Mr Harry Groen,
head of NCM, the Dutch credit insurer, said yesterday.
NCM recently acquired the short-term credit arm of Britain's Export Credits
Guarantee Department.
Mr Groen said, 'We are focused on increasing the market rather than picking
up bits of the business of our competitors.'
His 'declaration of peace' comes two months after NCM issued the warning:
'We haven't entered this market to be a marginal player.' It should come as
grim comfort to Trade Indemnity, the market leader with 82 per cent share.
TI has suffered badly through claims resulting from the recession over the
past two years and in March announced pre-tax losses of Pounds 46.6m for
1991. The group passed its dividend last year.
Mr Groen told the FT: 'We are not prepared to enter (the UK market) in a
cut-price kind of way. We are going to be competitive but we are not going
down the road of leading a price war. That's the one route to go out of
business.'
Adequate premium volume was, he said, likely to be essential for the company
to survive the next 24 months. 'Premium income of Pounds 35m a year is too
low to survive - you have to have between Pounds 125m and Pounds 150m,' he
said.
He pointed to 'considerable changes' in the European insurance market,
predicting that there would be just five or six companies by 1994.
While NCM has close links with TI - both hold shares in each other, and TI
has a representative on the NCM supervisory board - Mr Groen deflected
suggestions that he might make a bid for TI. 'I think the Office of Fair
Trading would object,' he said.
He pointed to radical changes in Europe's export credit insurance market in
the coming year, occasioned by the likely release next month of European
Commission proposals for all 'marketable' risk to be handled by
private-sector insurers. That is likely to include all policies up to three
years and will exclude political risk, which will continue to be at least
reinsured by national governments.
The proposals have caused concern in France and Germany, where government
agencies still manage short-term export insurance, but are likely to be
welcomed by NCM, which has been offering such insurance cover since 1933.

FT  18 JUN 92 / Why statistics on pay slip away between the figures: The
wide gap between settlements and average earnings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OFFICIAL figures to be released today will show that average earnings
continued to rise at an annual rate of 7 per cent-plus in April.
The Department of Employment's earnings figure, together with more gloomy
unemployment news, has remained obstinately high in spite of the recession
and the gradual reduction in inflation.
Behind the scenes in the Treasury, the Department of Employment and the
City, questions are being asked about why the increase in average earnings
is not falling more swiftly to the level of today's more modest pay
settlements - about 4 per cent.
The first answer is that such settlement figures go back only a month or
two, whereas the underlying rate of increase in average earnings is an
annualised figure that includes settlements of between 8 per cent and 10 per
cent from the first half of last year.
Soon the recent settlements will edge out the older statistics and the
earnings figure will fall below 7 per cent later this year, possibly even
below 6 per cent if the recovery remains fragile.
Nevertheless, 7 per cent-plus has been a worryingly tenacious floor.
Inflation fell below 5 per cent in August 1991 and average earnings first
fell below 8 per cent in July of that year, having been on 9 per cent in
March.
Some analysts are even dusting down the old 'wages drift' concept to help
explain the high level of average earnings, while others are asking whether
the way the earnings statistics are collected might overstate real pay
levels.
Wages drift - the difference between reported settlements and earnings per
head - has usually been explained by increases in overtime and one-off
bonuses, and is usually associated with periods of rapid growth.
The Engineering Employers Federation calculates that at the height of the
boom in 1988 nearly 40 per cent of the annual rate of pay rises - 3.5 per
cent on top of settlements of 5.2 per cent - came from 'drift'. By 1991,
that had fallen to 1 per cent, accounting for only 10 per cent of the annual
rise.
At present, overtime is not picking up, so if there is a drift between
settlements and wages not accounted for by the lag in the earnings index it
must have another cause.
Mr Alistair Hatchett of pay research group Incomes Data Services, who
describes current drift as 'labour market pull' rather than 'union push',
points to the continuing popularity of one-off bonuses, often as a way of
sweetening low percentage increases.
Like other analysts, he emphasises the 'employment effect', which results in
average pay per head rising in a company as a result of lower-paid jobs
being abolished. That may be compatible with holding pay to the rate of
inflation at plant level but, overall, creates an impression of upward
drift. Department of Employment research suggests that that effect is more
than offset by increased use of part-time workers, mainly women, whose pay
depresses earnings per head.
But is there a drift problem at all? Mr Don Smith, economist at investment
bank Midland Montagu, argues that the statistical lag between between
earnings and settlements is a sufficient explanation for the present
earnings level.
He also questions whether the Department of Employment figures may be biased
towards better-paying larger employers and the public sector. Companies
employing fewer than 25 people are not counted, but anyway they do not
account for a large proportion of the workforce.
He may be over-optimistic about wages drift, but there is one short-term
reason for earnings to be high that will soon work their way out. The March
figure was so high because of the number of companies bringing forward
payments to staff who would have had to pay more tax if Labour had won the
election.
Unemployment in the UK will rise faster than anywhere else in Europe this
year for the second year running and may reach 3m, according to a Labour
party study based on the latest European Community statistics. The
unemployment total for May, announced today, is expected to jump another
30,000 to more than 2.7m.

FT  18 JUN 92 / Tory election win fails to lift retail spending
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SALES on Britain's high streets were virtually flat last month, suggesting
that the Conservative general election victory failed to prompt a spending
boom.
The volume of retail sales rose a seasonally adjusted 0.3 per cent in May,
compared with April's 0.8 per cent month-on-month rise, when sales were
boosted because of Easter falling late.
Although last month's increase was the second consecutive monthly rise, the
three-monthly trends suggest that British consumers are still reluctant to
spend.
In the three months to May, sales fell by 0.1 per cent on the previous three
months and were down 0.3 per cent on the same period a year previously.
The figures from the Central Statistical Office add to evidence that retail
sales have yet to show a sustained recovery. Last week the Confederation of
British Industry's distributive trades survey painted a similar picture of
sluggish sales.
Most recent figures from the CSO show that sales by food retailers rose by
0.4 per cent in the latest three months, and sales by department stores by
0.6 per cent.
Sales of non-food items - including clothing, footwear and household goods -
were less encouraging, falling by 0.6 per cent in the three months to May
compared with the previous three-month period.
The British Retail Consortium, a trade group that claims to represent 90 per
cent of the retail industry, said May was a month in which sectors reacting
favourably to good weather did best.
The Treasury welcomed the figures, pointing out that sales in May were at
the highest level since November 1991.
Mr Gordon Brown, Labour's trade spokesman, said: 'Today's figures showing
flat retail sales confirm that the British economy is yet to experience the
promised Tory post-election boom.'

FT  18 JUN 92 / Three-union merger wins Nalgo backing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CREATION of the biggest public-service union in Europe, with 1.4m
members, became a virtual certainty yesterday when Nalgo leaders averted
attempts to wreck a planned merger with two other unions.
Delegates to Nalgo's annual conference defeated a series of motions aimed at
ending or delaying the amalgamation with the Nupe public-service union and
Cohse health union, planned to take effect from July next year.
Nalgo's conference had been viewed by leaders of all three unions as the
last and potentially most serious threat to 'final proposals' for
amalgamation drawn up this year.
Its backing, with the earlier support of the Nupe and Cohse conferences,
means that the proposals will go to a ballot of members at the end of the
year. It is highly unlikely that the unions' members would vote against the
advice of their leaders.
Unison, as the new organisation will be called, would be Britain's largest
union, overtaking the 1.1m-strong TGWU general workers' grouping.
The presence this week of Mr Bill Morris, TGWU general secretary, at the
annual conference of the GMB general workers in Blackpool fuelled
speculation that those two organisations would also merge.
No formal talks are in progress, though, and an amalgamation would be some
years off.
At Nalgo's annual conference in Bournemouth, delegates voted overwhelmingly
in favour of the final proposals after a series of heated debates lasting
all day.
Some opponents were angry that union subscriptions in the new union would be
collected centrally. In Nalgo, collection is carried out by branches, which
then pass some of the money on to headquarters.
Other opponents are concerned about plans for affiliation to the Labour
party. Nalgo is not affiliated, but in the new union all individual members
would have a right to affiliate.
Mr Ken Jones, chair of the retired members' group, speaking against the
merger plans, said: 'The new union will be tarred with the one brush:
affiliation to the Labour party.'
Speaking for the merger, Mr Alan Jinkinson, Nalgo general secretary, said
the only beneficiaries of a decision not to merge would be the government
and employers.
He said: 'We must not allow employers to drive a wedge between manual and
white-collar workers. Nor can we allow a hostile government to benefit from
wasteful multi-unionism.'

FT  18 JUN 92 / Bar Council urges formal system of plea bargaining
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE, Legal Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BAR COUNCIL, the governing body for barristers, yesterday called for the
introduction of a formal system of plea bargaining in England and Wales.
A system under which the judge indicates the likely sentence if a defendant
pleads guilty and does not opt for a contested trial would cut delays and
improve the efficiency of the Crown Courts, it says.
That type of arrangement is common in the US but remains illegal in England
and Wales, although not all forms of plea bargaining are outlawed.
Arrangements by which the prosecution agrees not to proceed with a more
serious charge if the accused pleads guilty to a lesser offence are common.
The difference between those arrangements and the US system is that no
guarantees are made in the UK in respect of penalties or the sentence the
accused will receive.
In a report on ways of improving the efficiency of Crown Courts, the Bar
says: 'It is our belief that many guilty defendants would plead guilty if
they knew what the sentence would be and that such a system would command
public confidence.'
At the moment, it says, defendants who know they are guilty will opt for
trial and take a chance that a jury may acquit them.
'Many would regard this as a complete waste of precious public resources,'
the report says.
The Bar rejects the Appeal Court's view that plea bargaining would impose
'improper' pressure on defendants to plead guilty.
Safeguards could be introduced to protect the defendant's rights, the report
says. All discussions on the deal should take place in the presence of the
defendant and his legal advisers, it says; discussion should be recorded;
and indications of sentence should be formally made in court.
The report recommends that the Appeal Court should issue minimum percentage
discounts on custodial sentences where a guilty plea is put forward.
It should make clear that a defendant is entitled to a credit for a guilty
plea in all cases except where the sentence is fixed by law or the offence
is so serious that only a sentence in accordance with the full tariff is
appropriate. The earlier the plea is made, the greater the reduction.

FT  18 JUN 92 / Foundation transactions 'ceased'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   VADUZ, LIECHTENSTEIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR WERNER KEICHER, the sole council member of the Maxwell Foundation, said
yesterday that there had been no transactions through the foundation since
Mr Robert Maxwell's death in November. He also said that he had not been
paid for his services since then.
The Maxwell Foundation is the Liechtenstein vehicle that was used by Mr
Maxwell to control many of his interests.
Mr Keicher, a Liechtenstein lawyer, said the foundation's objectives were:
to support basic scientific and medical research; to promote lasting peace
in Israel; to support capable young entrepreneurs; to support education for
encouraging peace and ending racism; and to support non-profit institutions
in Liechtenstein.
He said the foundation, established in 1970, had probably distributed less
than Pounds 2m since he took over from his father as trustee in 1985. Of
this sum, Pounds 1.5m had gone to Leeds University.
He denied knowledge of written instructions from people governing the
foundation or its subsidiaries. He had had 'absolutely no contact' with Mr
Kevin Maxwell or other members of the family in connection with distributing
money, and often made decisions on donations himself.
Mr Keicher, however, appears to have tremendous power, which he now intends
to wield for the first time.
He called the foundation the 'grandmother' of the US companies Sphere and PH
(US), two companies outside the reach of administrators which are still
trading. The foundation owns Swico, which controls the other two companies.
He said he believed he had powers to appoint or dismiss directors, and to
help determine dividends and 'absolutely would not hesitate' to remove Mr
Kevin Maxwell from the board of these companies if 'it is necessary'.
He said he knew nothing of transactions through PH (US) and other companies
in recent months, and emphasised that he had seen his role and that of the
foundation as a holding function, not a management function.
Asked why he had become involved in a foundation associated with Mr Robert
Maxwell, he said: 'When you look back from today, it's another situation. Mr
Maxwell was one of the most wealthy men in Britain, with a big reputation .
. . Now it is different, with the knowledge we have today.'

<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT has agreed to consider changes to the Financial Services Act
in the light of the confidential report by Imro, the self-regulatory body
for the fund management industry, on supervision of the Maxwell companies.
But ministers have indicated that they will wait until they have seen not
only the report but the detailed assessment of it by the Securities and
Investments Board (SIB).
Mr Anthony Nelson, the economic secretary, also signalled yesterday that the
government was unlikely to try to arrange publication of the report as a
parliamentary paper, in order to deal with the legal difficulties that are
said to exist with publishing a full report.
In response to a question from Mr David Shaw, one of the Tory MPs leading
the parliamentary campaign on behalf of the Maxwell pensioners, Mr Nelson
said that Treasury officials were discussing with SIB 'the scope of SIB's
ability to publish reports within the powers transferred to them under the
act'.
The MPs believe criticism of some of the professional advisers to the
Maxwell companies will increase the prospect of help for the pensioners.
The Treasury is said to be considering arranging for publication of the
report's conclusions and findings.
It is also conscious of the need to maintain some broad consistency between
the extent of what is published about the supervision of Maxwell companies
and the report of the Bingham inquiry into BCCI.
MPs are pressing Mr Peter Lilley, the social security secretary, to make a
formal approach to the Liechtenstein authorities to release information
about the Maxwell affair. A delegation of MPs saw officials at the Swiss
embassy, which acts in Liechtenstein's interests, and were told that
co-operation could only follow a formal request.

FT  18 JUN 92 / Top job at MGN goes to deputy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE board of Mirror Group Newspapers yesterday announced that Mr Ernest
Burrington had stepped down as its chairman.
Mr Burrington, a former editor of The People, will stay on as a
non-executive director until the company's annual meeting in July. He has
been replaced by Sir Robert Clark, who has been deputy chairman since
December.
At the same time Mr Lawrence Guest, finance director of MGN, has resigned as
a director and will be leaving the company.
In a formal statement Sir Robert expressed sadness at the resignation of Mr
Burrington and paid tribute to Mr Guest as a 'most loyal and committed
member of the company'.
In fact Sir Robert and Mr Alan Clements, the other deputy chairman, went to
Mr Burrington's office yesterday and suggested it would be in the best
interests of the company if he resigned. The same happened to Mr Guest, who
had worked for the company for 30 years. The decision to seek the two
resignations was taken at meetings of the other directors on Tuesday.
Mr John Talbot, the Arthur Andersen administrator to the Maxwell private
interests, was consulted before the decision was implemented.
A group of banks effectively now controls the 54 per cent of MGN that used
to be owned by the Maxwell private interests because the share stakes had
been pledged in support of loans.
No impropriety of any kind was alleged against either Mr Burrington or Mr
Guest.
Some directors felt that they had not acted decisively enough when the first
hints of possible irregularities surfaced last August.
Mr Burrington was not available for comment last night but friends pointed
out that other directors who are staying on had as much knowledge of the
irregularities as either Mr Burrington or Mr Guest.
In the past, Mr Burrington has said that although both he and Mr Guest had
been worried that money appeared to be missing from the Mirror, there was no
evidence that anything illegal was happening, and there was the danger of a
libel action from Robert Maxwell.
MGN will next week issue accounts detailing officially for the first time
the financial state of the company and the pension funds. A relisting of
MGN's suspended share price is also being sought.
All the signs are that there is likely to be a considerable delay in the
sale of the group, which includes the Daily Mirror, Sunday Mirror, The
People, Scottish Daily Record and Sunday Mail.
All Mr Talbot will say is that there are no plans at present to sell the
company but that the issue will be kept under review.
However, after the appointment of Department of Trade and Industry
inspectors to look at the affairs of MGN and in particular the flotation, it
may now be well into next year before there is a sale.
Soon after taking over as chairman in December after the death of Maxwell,
Mr Burrington expressed disgust at what his former employer had done.

FT  18 JUN 92 / Airlines warned of traffic 'meltdown'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPE'S air traffic may suffer 'meltdown' this summer with pilots and
aircraft stranded in the wrong airports because of too much demand for
airspace, a senior official of the International Air Transport Association
(Iata), warned yesterday.
Mr Norman Jackson, the technical director, said: 'It doesn't take much of an
industrial problem or technical hitch to cause serious disruption.'
Iata said there already had been such troubles this year: a British Airways
flight from London to Paris had to turn back as a result of a power failure
at a Brussels air traffic control centre.
Iata's warning came after its report earlier this month on congestion to
Eurocontrol, the Brussels-based, government-backed air safety group. It
concerned the crisis on May 22 when air traffic management over Europe
'reached breaking point'. Flights were delayed three times as much as usual.
The two organisations are working together to establish an improved air
traffic control system, but that will not be in place until 1995-96. Mr
Jackson said that until then, airspace would have to be rationed, and
'rationing translates into delays for passengers'.
The warning highlights the growing difficulties in European air traffic over
recent years, which was interrupted only last year when passengers avoided
air travel because of the Gulf war.
The recovery in European air traffic this year has been faster than many in
the industry forecast, said Mr Jackson, and is now higher than it was in
1990. 'This summer will not be the end of it,' he said.

FT  18 JUN 92 / Backer sought to save London zoo
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LONDON ZOO, the world's oldest zoo and one of the capital's leading tourist
attractions, is to close in September unless a private backer can be found.
The zoo, which occupies 36 acres in the north part of Regent's Park, has
been in financial difficulties for some time. Attendances so far this year
have been up to 30 per cent below last year and the zoo has a deficit of
Pounds 2m on annual running costs.
Sir John Chapple, president of the Zoological Society of London, which runs
the zoo, said closure was the only option 'that will ensure the survival of
the society as a whole'.
He said discussions were continuing with interested parties, but he refused
to name them. A government bail-out is unlikely after it refused further
grants last year and told the zoo to put its house in order.
As part of a royal park, the zoo is technically the property of the Queen,
but is managed by the Department of National Heritage and leased to the
society for a peppercorn rent.
It has nine listed buildings. They include the Mappin terraces, built for
bears in the 1920s with a donation from jewellers Mappin &amp; Webb; and the
penguin pool, designed in the 1930s by Berthold Lubetkin. The oldest listed
buildings, dating from the first half of the last century, include the camel
and giraffe houses, both by Decimus Burton.
The listed buildings need repairs estimated at Pounds 15m. Under the terms
of the lease the society is responsible for repairs, but last year the
government agreed to assume responsibility if the zoo surrendered the site.
The National Heritage Department is not legally bound by planning
regulations, but it said it would seek planning permission in the normal way
if it decided to demolish one or more of the buildings.
Options for the site are limited by regulations for royal parks. The
department said yesterday there was 'no question at all' of office or
residential development, and it was 'most unlikely' that a commercial
development such as a theme park would replace it. The most likely options
appear to be reversion to general park use, or a scaled-down zoo.
The zoo's likely demise was first announced last year, but after a
cost-cutting programme it broke even in March and cancelled closure plans.
It has cut jobs over the past few years, and the remaining 150 staff are
likely to be made redundant.
Dr Jo Gipps, zoo curator, estimated that it would take six months to find
alternative homes for the animals so that the breeding programme could
continue. He was confident none would have to be destroyed. Some larger
animals may be moved to the society's other site at Whipsnade Wild Animal
Park, Bedfordshire.
London Tourist Board said the closure would not have a significant impact on
tourism as few people went to London just to visit the zoo. In 1991 the zoo
was the ninth most popular attraction in and around London, with 1.1m
visitors.

FT  18 JUN 92 / Court clears trustees to cut Maxwell pensions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND HUGHES, Law Courts Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE TRUSTEES of the Maxwell Communications works pension scheme were
yesterday given High Court permission to 'eke out' their available funds by
reducing the pensions of 3,640 pensioners to 31 per cent for the next five
years.
About 1,600 of the pensioners who are former employees of Mirror Group
Newspapers will have their pensions topped up by MGN - although no guarantee
has been given about how long that will continue.
The remaining pensions will be topped up, for an unspecified period, out of
the government's Pounds 2.5m stop-gap fund.
The court was told that it would take Pounds 1.8m of the fund to top up all
the works scheme pensions for a year.
Continuation of the payment by the trustees of 31 per cent of pensions could
be affected if the scheme were found to be in deficit to the common
investment fund - the pot into which Maxwell pension funds were put for
investment. The deficit might be as much as Pounds 11m.
The court also said that the trustees could cease paying the annual 3 per
cent pension increase required by the works scheme rules.
Miss Sarah Asplin, for the trustees, told Sir Donald Nicholls, the
Vice-Chancellor - senior Chancery Division judge - that it was discovered at
the end of last year that about Pounds 109m was missing from the works
scheme's funds.
Describing the trustees' proposal as a fair, reasonable and sensible interim
measure, Sir Donald said they should keep the situation under close review
and return to court if it changed.

THE SOLICITORS' profession is in danger of becoming limited to those with
private means, the Law Society warned yesterday.
In a letter to Mr John Patten, education secretary, society president Mr
Philip Ely said the collapse of the discretionary grant system for students
on the profession's finals course amounted to a 'pre-qualification means
test'.
The College of Law said the proportion of its income from fees paid by
English and Welsh local education authorities had halved in two years.
Urging Mr Patten to require authorities to provide grants, Mr Ely said
trainees were further disadvantaged in that professional-qualification
courses have been excluded from new arrangements for tax relief on
vocational training.

FT  18 JUN 92 / The Big Lie, Inside Maxwell's Empire: Sins of the father -
Only a small fraction of the Pounds 933m plundered by Maxwell is likely to
be recovered. He will be remembered for this. But he did not run the empire
on his own. During 1991 he had decreasing influence on a day-to-day basis.
He came to rely on a small core of executives, and on his sons - Kevin and
Ian

KEVIN MAXWELL hurried out of his office on the ninth floor of Maxwell House
into its central reception lobby at 11.30am on November 5 1991.
Behind him the double doors leading to Robert Maxwell's vast office were
closed. He turned into his brother Ian's office and asked the secretary to
leave. On her way out she overheard Kevin say: 'It's Dad.'
One thousand eight hundred miles away, off the coast of Gran Canaria, a
full-scale air and sea search was under way for Robert Maxwell, who had been
reported missing from his yacht, the Lady Ghislaine.
'Give me 20 minutes to call the bankers,' Kevin told Ernest Burrington, then
managing director of Mirror Group Newspapers (MGN), who was drafting a press
release. Kevin - anticipating the urgent steps needed to save his father's
empire - called Samuel Montagu, MGN's merchant bank, and Sir Michael
Richardson, chairman of Smith New Court, stockbrokers to MGN and Maxwell
Communication Corporation (MCC).
As the directors of MCC assembled at 3pm in Kevin's office for an emergency
board meeting, an electronic message flashed across City dealing screens
that MGN and MCC shares were suspended. A second message, 10 minutes later,
told the world what the directors now knew: Robert Maxwell was missing at
sea, feared lost.
'Kevin told me just before the board meeting that his father was missing,'
says Basil Brookes, MCC finance director, whose own departure had been
planned for that day. 'I agreed to stay and help. I didn't have the heart to
say no.'
The UK's clearing banks, which had financed the Maxwell empire, held
emergency meetings with Kevin. 'The lad was really upset,' said one UK bank
director that afternoon. 'But there was tremendous dynastic loyalty: 'We are
the Maxwells and it will carry on.' '
The week after Robert Maxwell's death his sons, fielding press conferences
and emergency bank syndicate meetings, attracted widespread sympathy.
Bankers, initially sceptical that two young men in their early 30s could
carry the huge burden, discussed bringing in a senior accountant as a father
figure. But they changed their minds. 'It's an almost unimaginable weight on
them, but I think they're going to make it,' said one clearing bank director
in admiration.
Behind the composure the problems were pressing. On Wednesday, the day after
his father's death, Kevin told Swiss Bank Corporation that the private
Maxwell companies were reneging on the promise he had given the week before
to repay its Pounds 57.5m loan.
On Friday, as the Maxwell family began leaving for the funeral on
Jerusalem's Mount of Olives, half a dozen Swiss Bank executives were
closeted with lawyers from the City firm Allen &amp; Overy.
On Monday, 24 hours after Robert Maxwell was buried, Swiss Bank met the City
of London police - and the Serious Fraud Office was called in to investigate
the Maxwell empire.
Kevin and Ian inherited their father's empire for less than four weeks. On
December 3 they were forced by fellow directors and banks to resign as
chairmen of MCC and MGN. A month after Maxwell died Headington Investments,
the parent company of the Maxwell empire, was put into administration under
UK insolvency laws.
When the Maxwell empire collapsed it emerged that MCC, MGN and the Maxwell
pension funds had been stripped of Pounds 933m in cash and assets. Only a
small fraction is likely to be recovered. That is the legacy for which
Robert Maxwell will be remembered.
However Maxwell did not run the empire on his own. Several of his directors
and bankers say that during 1991 he had increasingly little influence on a
day-to-day basis. He relied on a small core of executives, and on his sons
Kevin and Ian.
Kevin had a particularly important role. Interviews with Maxwell directors
and bankers show that he took day-to-day control of much of the financial
planning and the complex treasury departments of many of the businesses for
several years before his father's death.
Papers obtained by the Financial Times also reveal that Kevin signed -
although he may not have known the implications - some of the documents
authorising transactions that led to the loss of money from the Maxwell
pension funds and public companies.
Part of the explanation for how Kevin appeared able to take on his father's
largest companies so smoothly after the death was that he had already been
carrying much of the burden.
In 1988 when Robert Maxwell recruited Jean Pierre Anselmini as MCC deputy
chairman, Maxwell said: 'I am 65, and I have two young sons in their early
30s. Join us and participate in their education for a few years.'
The education was rapid. In early 1991 Maxwell promoted Kevin to chief
executive of MCC and Ian to deputy chairman of MGN. The two were also
directors of many parts of the Maxwell empire's 'private side' - a tangled
web of nearly 400 different companies - and directors of Bishopsgate
Investment Management (BIM), the company managing much of the Pounds 700m
Maxwell pension funds.
Kevin was head of the larger company, valued in May at Pounds 1.2bn compared
with MGN's Pounds 500m. It had become clear that Kevin was taking on the
more financially complex jobs within the empire.
'Ian is a salesman, a marketing person, very good with people,' says one MCC
director. Peter Jay, the former British ambassador to the US who worked for
Maxwell for three years as chief of staff, says that Ian 'is a conciliator,
looking for solutions'. It seemed natural within Maxwell House that Ian
would gravitate towards MGN, with the newspapers' need for marketing talent.
Ian also acted as his father's negotiator and envoy on many of the eastern
European 'investments' where - it has become even clearer in retrospect than
it was at the time - profit was not a priority.
In contrast, Kevin took on much of the responsibility of running MCC. It was
a formidable challenge, straddling the Atlantic, with huge movements of
foreign currency to manage and a debt burden of more than Dollars 2bn. By
1990, according to MCC directors, he had also taken effective day-to-day
control of the complex treasury department, under his father's authority.
Until late 1991 the treasury was shared by MCC and the private companies -
although not the pension funds - and channelled much of the daily flow of
millions of pounds between the Maxwell companies and their banks.
'How that young man dealt with all those issues is beyond me - he must have
a brain like a Hewlett Packard,' says one of Maxwell's main UK bankers. The
Maxwell House joke was that managing directors were nothing; finance
directors were king. By 1991 Kevin's financial skill had made him clearly
the crown prince.
Kevin's importance in the organisation could not have been guessed from the
nature of his office in Maxwell House. It was an unprepossessing room, only
a third the size of his father's. Bare and L-shaped, it held only a desk and
table and was lit by one narrow window.
Kevin's style was in marked contrast to that of his father. An analyst for
the Maxwell finance department says: 'He hated anyone who was excitable or
who got agitated, and it was very obvious he was trying to be different from
his father.' Both Maxwell sons, however, were capable of their father's
customary flashes of anger and extreme rudeness.
Kevin and Ian were also subject to their father's extreme disruptiveness.
Les Williams, one of the office managers, remembers that Kevin, under orders
from his father, once moved his wife Pandora and his children from London to
New York - only to be pulled back to London after three weeks.
Maxwell would also shout at both sons in public, which onlookers found
deeply embarrassing. He would shout: 'You're a fool, you're such an idiot,
how can you give that answer?'
Many of the directors found Ian easier company; Kevin's intensity and
preoccupation with the figures led one Maxwell House aide to regard him as a
'desiccated accountant'. He was distant from many of the publishing
executives.
Instead, Kevin was closer to the finance executives. Brookes, at 33 the same
age as Kevin is now, says: 'I felt for him, the way the old man treated him.
We went to football together. One day he said: 'What's your team?' I said
Blackburn, so he arranged to go, arranged for parking for me. He said:
'Don't tell my father we're here - I've told him you and I are sorting out
the working capital this afternoon.''
Many, however, commented on his extraordinary self-possession. 'Kevin is
unbelievably cool,' says one MCC director; a bank director adds: 'Quite
extraordinary sang-froid.'
As Maxwell became progressively less involved in the day-to-day running of
the businesses through 1990 and 1991, it was Kevin who took on the burden.
He was the regular point of contact for the banks as the financial strains
on the empire increased. 'The banks dealt with Robert Maxwell for signings,
but real discussion was always with Kevin, both for MCC and private
companies,' says one UK clearing banker.
He adds: 'We could always get hold of Kevin, but given the pressure the boy
was under it was hard.' Another bank's senior director confirms: 'He was not
one to avoid phone calls. He would always call back, even if it was at
midnight.'
The banks were clear about the centrality of Kevin's role. One director
comments: 'The others didn't realise the whole picture. They would say: 'We
must refer this to Kevin.' '
During the summer the pressure intensified. One banker says: 'We were
concerned about his (Kevin's) health. He was working seven days a week, 25
hours a day. He was being strategic director, he was being treasurer,
assistant treasurer, assistant assistant treasurer.'
Maxwell had kept the inner core of executives small. A finance department
analyst says: 'Kevin kept trying to involve more people in running the
company, but his father kept refusing to let him.'
One of the administrators to the Maxwell empire, surveying a map of MCC's
astonishing total of 400 subsidiaries next to the 400 private Maxwell
companies, recently said in wonder: 'When you think of it, 800 companies
were run by a man and a boy.'
With that central a role in his father's empire, how much did Kevin know? On
resigning as chairman of MCC on December 3 Kevin said: 'My father had a
style based on a need-to-know basis.'
It is clear his father kept ultimate authority for many of the financial
decisions in the empire. It is also clear, however, from documents obtained
by the Financial Times, that Kevin was closely involved in many of the
transactions that are now seen to be central to the eventual removal of
money from the public companies and pension funds. He was also central to
some that are now the focus of the SFO's investigation.
Through his day-to-day control over the treasury department and as an MCC
director Kevin was closely involved in the loans made by MCC to the private
Maxwell companies in 1991.
Loans of cash from MCC to these private companies reached a peak of Pounds
300m in July. Kevin's signature was on at least 11 of these transfers of
cash, totalling Pounds 145m. The signature was always accompanied, as
required, by another director's, and the transactions were not illegal.
However MCC's loans to the private Maxwell companies provoked intense rows
during August between the Maxwells and the other MCC directors.
One of the most controversial episodes, which some MCC directors and bankers
now concede might have alerted them to the looming problems, was an
extraordinary pattern of highly irregular foreign exchange dealings through
the treasury in July.
During three weeks MCC traded in tens of millions of pounds of foreign
currency with some 20 of the world's biggest banks. In most cases it paid
for the currency late; the condition for such spot deals is that they are
paid within hours. The effect was to give it a three-week unofficial 'loan'
of around Pounds 100m. Copies of the bank authorisations show that some of
the foreign exchange deals were authorised by Robert Maxwell and the dealing
conducted by Kevin; some were authorised by Kevin and dealt by junior
treasury officers.
One of the Serious Fraud Office's investigations focuses on an alleged
scheme to support the share prices of MCC and MGN.
The collapsing share price of the two companies was draining away what was
left of the Maxwell empire's lifeblood. Investigators have now discovered
that the private companies routed some Pounds 300m - obtained from many
different routes through the empire - to secretive Liechtenstein and Swiss
trusts which then bought MCC and MGN shares.
A letter and a corroborating fax show that Kevin Maxwell was intimately
involved in the purchase of 9m MCC shares by Yakosa, a Swiss trust, and a
further 16m shares by Servex, another Swiss trust - both of which have said
they are independent of the Maxwells.
On May 29 last year, Kevin Maxwell sent a signed fax to Goldman Sachs, the
US bank, saying that the shares would be bought by the trusts with Pounds
55.33m provided by BIT, a Maxwell private company. Goldman's lawyers say the
firm acted properly.
The SFO is investigating whether Robert or Kevin Maxwell breached the
Companies Act by failing to disclose the purchases of the shares by the
Swiss trusts; if either had a financial interest in the trusts, the
purchases should have been disclosed under company law, because the Maxwells
were both directors of MCC. The trusts' lawyers have said that they are
independent.
Documents show that Kevin Maxwell was closely involved in the management of
'stocklending' from the pension funds. Stocklending is a legal and common
practice whereby pension funds lend out their assets for a few days or weeks
to other financial institutions as a way of boosting their income.
In retrospect, however, it is clear that stocklending from the Maxwell
pension funds was highly unusual, particularly during 1991. This was partly
because of the length of time for which the stocks were lent, and partly
because the pension funds were not always adequately protected.
The main way the Maxwell pension funds were eventually stripped of assets
was through stocklending to Maxwell's private companies which could not pay
them back.
A memo to Kevin Maxwell from Larry Trachtenberg, a director of private
Maxwell investment companies, is dated December 17 1990, nearly a year
before Maxwell's death. Headed: 'Outstanding items and action for week
commencing 17.12.90', it reminds Kevin to send letters to Capel Cure Myers
and Invesco MIM, the investment houses which managed some of the Maxwell
pension money. Trachtenberg says the letters 'request that we roll over the
stock borrowing positions until 31.1.91. As we have agreed the BIM (pension
management company) year end is not until April 5 so this should not cause a
problem.'
The significance of this is partly that it suggests that Kevin had some
responsibility for dealing with the Maxwell pension money and for
negotiation of stocklending arrangements with banks and investment managers.
One of the most controversial actions by both Kevin and Ian emerged in the
weeks immediately after their father's death; the issue of Berlitz, the
international language instruction company. Berlitz was a central part of
why the MCC directors turned against the Maxwell brothers.
Brookes says: 'Kevin's attitude after his dad died was: 'Let's sort it out
and worry about who did what later.' That's why Coopers &amp; Lybrand Deloitte
(the accountants in charge of estimating the empire's financial position)
wanted to keep him on and why we could work with him, at first.'
On November 7, two days after Maxwell's death, MCC announced that it had
agreed to sell its 56 per cent stake in Berlitz to Fukutake, the Japanese
publisher. The prospect of Dollars 265m flowing into MCC was welcomed by
bankers.
Just under two weeks later, however the MCC board was plunged into
bewilderment and anxiety.
According to Brookes, that day Kevin told the MCC board that 1.9m of MCC's
total of 10.6m Berlitz shares 'were not where they should be'. It emerged
that they had been already pledged to banks to raise loans for private
Maxwell companies - the private companies had in effect appropriated an MCC
asset.
Brookes says that he had no idea that this had been done. It was an
explosive issue for the MCC board because MCC had nearly Dollars 2bn of debt
 -its 'jumbo loan', famous in banking circles. One of the conditions of the
loan was a so-called 'negative pledge' - a promise that MCC would not sell
or mortgage assets of more than Pounds 10m without the permission of the
banking syndicate.
Brookes asked Kevin if any other share certificates were missing. Kevin
replied: 'Could you make sure there aren't?'
Brookes now says: 'In fact we couldn't have checked.' Some of the shares had
been transfered to a company in the heart of the Maxwell labyrinth of
private companies - Bishopsgate Investment Trust. It is similarly named, but
entirely distinct from Bishopsgate Investment Management, the pension
management company.
Brookes says: 'We had no way of tracing them once they had gone into BIT; no
one else but Kevin was a director of both.' Later, it was revealed that some
of the shares had been transfered to BIT a year earlier - in November 1990.
The issue of whether the transfer of the Berlitz shares to BIT was improper
is not clear-cut. Nor is it clear whether, when BIT later pledged the shares
to banks for private Maxwell company loans, this was a breach of MCC's bank
covenants. What is clear is that Kevin knew about the pledging of the shares
long before his father's death and knew that, therefore, they could not
immediately be sold to repay MCC's debt.
The same memo from Trachtenberg to Kevin discusses - as long ago as December
1990 - whether shares in 'BTZ', believed to refer to Berlitz, could be used
as security for bank loans.
A signed letter from Kevin to Lehman Brothers International, the US bank,
dated September 20 1991, also confirms the 'transfer of 1.37m shares in
Berlitz from ourselves (BIT) to yourselves . . . by way of security for the
loan of Dollars 117m United States Treasury Bills from Lehman to BIM'.
On Sunday November 24 MCC's US lawyers discovered that 2.4m more Berlitz
shares were missing.
Documents dated November 13 1991 - eight days after Maxwell's death - were
signed by Ian Maxwell and Trachtenberg, and confirm the pledge of 2.4m
Berlitz shares to Swiss Volksbank in return for a Dollars 35m loan.
Some of the banks which received pledges of shares are now claiming the
right to keep the shares - making the sale to Fukutake impossible. The
pledging of Berlitz blasted a Pounds 144m hole in MCC.
On Sunday December 1, at a meeting of all the Maxwell bankers, Coopers
announced that it had uncovered a hitherto undetected pattern of loans
within the empire.
The private companies - now effectively bankrupt - owed MCC, MGN and the
pension funds hundreds of millions of pounds which would never be repaid.
The next morning, MGN and MCC shares were suspended a second time on the
stock market. A fax from MCC's US office slid on to Brookes' desk. It
revealed Kevin's signature before Maxwell's death, arranging the pledging of
Berlitz shares - and the signatures of Ian and Trachtenberg after his death.
One MCC director says: 'I had thought Kevin was on our side but after this I
realised what we had in our middle.'
Kevin rang Anselmini at his Paris home late that night. According to
Anselmini he said: 'It is being said we are responsible for hundreds of
million of pounds missing. I cannot go into explanations, but I did not want
you to know from the press or the other directors. Also, the banks are
demanding that my brother and I quit. Could you call them and see if they
can be persuaded?'
Anselmini soon called Kevin back. He had discovered that it was the other
directors more than the banks who wanted him out.
Peter Laister told Kevin the directors wanted him out.
On the morning of Tuesday 3rd December the Maxwell brothers resigned their
chairmanships of MCC and MGN.
That evening they moved their offices. After his father's death, Ian had
moved from Maxwell House's ninth floor to the adjoining MGN building - but
he now moved to an office on the south side of Maxwell House's sixth floor,
one of the private Maxwell company suites. Kevin moved down from the ninth
to join him, taking an office on the north side. Trachtenberg had an office
between them.
Maxwell House staff helped the boys move during Wednesday. The brothers took
their personal possessions out of the offices, their word processors
together with their electronic files, and some papers.
On December 4 Brookes circulated a memo in Maxwell House prohibiting the
shredding of any documents. The following day the Maxwell private companies
went into administration under UK insolvency laws.
MCC struggled on for 11 days, but finally on December 16 filed for
administration under UK and US insolvency laws. One MCC director says: 'It
was both the money loaned out of the bank account that finished us off - and
Berlitz.'
The SFO subsequently announced that it was launching five separate fraud
investigations into the collapse of the Maxwell empire. Meanwhile Kevin
Maxwell has attempted to keep trading. One of his friends commented that he
is obsessed with making a comeback, as his father did. He has told friends:
'Nothing in your life prepares you for fighting for your own survival.'

threshold of a new era' as they concluded the first summit meeting of the US
and Russia.
The two leaders finished their meeting by formally signing the summit's
greatest concrete achievement: an agreement to slash their strategic nuclear
missile forces by two thirds and eliminate the multiple-warhead
intercontinental missiles which they saw as the greatest threat to peace.
Mr Yeltsin said that, even before the implementation of the agreement, he
had taken Russia's multiple-warhead SS-18 missiles off alert.
He added - and Mr Bush concurred - that it was not worth arguing about
cutting British and French nuclear weapons, in that the number of missiles
involved was insignificant compared with the 21,000 warheads held by Russia
and the US.
The summit also yielded a string of further treaties aimed at preventing
double taxation of companies operating in the two countries and protecting
US investors in Russia, as well as agreements to co-operate on space
exploration, the prevention of arms proliferation and the development of
joint systems to provide early warning against missile attacks.
In all, 39 agreements were signed, and Mr Yegor Gaidar, Russian acting prime
minister, offered for exploitation three oilfields in western Siberia with
combined proven reserves of 4.4m tons, as well as two goldfields in eastern
Siberia.
Mr Yeltsin may not have won any more promises of economic aid but he
increased his chances of receiving the aid that the US has already promised
with his dramatic plea to the US Congress to pass a bill that would help
Russia in its difficult transition to a market economy.
The Freedom Support Act would combine aid measures specifically targeted at
Russia with approval of a Dollars 12bn US contribution to the International
Monetary Fund. This contribution is not directly tied to Russia but without
it the IMF would be handicapped in its efforts to co-ordinate the Dollars
24bn package that the leading industrial countries have agreed to provide.
The Russian leader warned the US that, in its own interests, it must play
its part by supporting his political and economic reforms.
Some Congress members said they had been swayed by Mr Yeltsin's speech but
Mr Thomas Foley, Democratic Speaker of the House of Representatives, warned
that many were still reluctant to vote for Russian aid while the US faced so
many domestic problems.
Mr Yeltsin said, however, that neither US aid nor the Dollars 24bn package
agreed by the leading industrial nations - which cannot be triggered until
Russia has achieved a stand-by agreement with the IMF - would save his
country. 'The most important thing is that they will open the door for the
influx of private capital. That will be a matter of hundreds of billions of
dollars,' Mr Yeltsin said.

FT  18 JUN 92 / The Bush-Yeltsin Summit: US prisoner of war issue poses
danger for Bush

<TEXT>
PRESIDENT George Bush is always proclaiming his optimism and his summit with
President Yeltsin, especially its substantive agreement on nuclear arms
cuts, offers justification for this point of view and for his reputation as
an international statesman.
In election-year politics, though, the glass he sees as half-full,
potentially brimming, is elsewhere perceived as half-empty and draining.
In this respect, Mr Yeltsin's declaration that Russia would help ascertain
the fate of Americans missing in action, or held as prisoners of war, is a
complicating factor.
In his powerful speech to Congress yesterday, especially his off-the-cuff
promise to spare no effort to find any PoWs, Mr Yeltsin did all he could to
help Russia meet US concerns and to secure US financial assistance, which is
what Mr Bush also wants.
The Russian president, in an inspired coup de theatre, personally collared
one prominent doubting senator, Mr John McCain, the Republican from Arizona
and a former prisoner of war in Vietnam.
Mr McCain was so impressed that he withdrew his threat to vote against
Russian aid while all PoWs remained unaccounted for - but he reserved the
right to vote thus for other reasons.
The Russian summit has given Mr Bush a necessary lift after the unfortunate
and ill-planned excursions to Panama and Rio de Janeiro last week, which did
nothing for a faltering re-election campaign partly predicated on his
competence in foreign affairs.
This fact alone had already raised serious doubts about Congressional
backing for the US contribution to the Dollars 24bn programme to assist
Russia.
Democrats have said bluntly that scant resources should first be spent at
home, while Republicans such as Mr McCain and Senator Richard Lugar of
Indiana had seized on the PoW issue as an additional cause to block
assistance.
Further complicating political matters is the position of Mr Ross Perot, the
prospective independent presidential candidate who has made a crusade out of
trying to find Americans missing in Indochina.
He has cancelled planned testimony on the subject to Congress this month,
but he is unlikely to stay silent for long - likewise Mr Bill Clinton, the
presumptive Democratic candidate, who is to have breakfast with Mr Yeltsin
today.
Until the unexpected announcement on Tuesday afternoon of the deep cuts in
nuclear arms, the Russian initiative on PoWs, trailed by Mr Yeltsin in
several interviews, had dominated the summit.
The offer was variously interpreted as a well-intended gesture and an
inducement to Congress to approve assistance, as well as an attempt to
enhance Mr Yeltsin's own image in the US.
This leaves Mr Bush with the task of getting Congress to act once Mr Yeltsin
has departed.
Success would be good for his reputation, but failure, or a stalemate, would
again be seen as evidence of poor domestic political leadership.
THE UK defence secretary Malcolm Rifkind is to be questioned in Parliament
about claims that British prisoners of war captured in Korea were sent to
the former Soviet Union and may still be held in Russia, our Foreign Staff
writes.
Labour MP Tam Dalyell last night tabled Commons questions on the matter.

FT  18 JUN 92 / Go-ahead for Dollars 3bn Mexican roads sell-off
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   MEXICO CITY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MEXICO'S government is to go ahead with a Dollars 3bn road privatisation
programme after its Congress approved changes to the transport laws earlier
this week.
The government owns about 1,000km of four-lane toll roads, for which it
might receive Dollars 2.6bn-2.9bn for the sale of concessions for 15-20
years.
The government will spend much of the money raised building free roads to
link highways now being built by the private sector. The government has
granted concessions for 3,500km of toll motorways at a cost to the private
sector of around Dollars 5bn. Concessions for another 2,400km of toll roads
will be granted soon.
A senior government official said Mexico was considering two mechanisms to
sell the highways. It might auction off concessions in the highways to
groups, of which foreigners could own 49 per cent.
The acquiring groups would probably follow the example of the private sector
building new toll roads, and issuing bonds guaranteed by toll payments to
finance their purchase.
Alternatively, the government might form 'highway companies' that would
issue bonds in the domestic and international markets, and whose interest
and principal was backed by toll payments. The government would then sell
shares in the highway companies.
The Mexican government has backed down over its threat to suspend all US
Drug Enforcement Agency activity in its country made in retaliation to a
decision by the US Supreme Court that the kidnapping and spiriting to the US
of a Mexican murder suspect was legal.
The government said it would resume 'temporarily' drug co-operation with the
US so as not to give an equivocal signal to drug smugglers. The DEA never
received notification that co-operation had been broken off, despite
Mexico's announcement on Monday night that its activities had been
suspended. The temporary 'resumption' of co-operation will be made permanent
once the revision of an extradition treaty is agreed, according to the
Mexican foreign ministry. The US assured the Mexican government on Tuesday
that co-operation over legal and drug matters would respect its sovereignty.

<TEXT>
A EUROPEAN Community team will visit Beirut next week to co-ordinate
resumption of economic co-operation with Lebanon, after the last two western
hostages, two German aid workers, arrived in Cologne yesterday.
Lebanese officials hope the end of the hostage crisis after the liberation
of Mr Heinrich Strubig and Mr Thomas Kemptner, will encourage a return of
western investors.
The EC is unfreezing Ecu166m (Pounds 117m) in financial aid, comprising
Ecu41m in grants, Ecu3m in risk capital and Ecu122m in loans from the
European Investment Bank. Mr David Tatham, the British ambassador in
Lebanon, confirmed there would be no more delays in European assistance to
the Beirut government, which is suffering from a severe economic crisis made
worse by shortfalls in expected reconstruction aid.
Mr Tatham said European- financed projects were being drawn up with Mr Fadel
Shallak, the president of the government's Council for Reconstruction and
Development. Mr Shallak has also begun negotiations with World Bank
officials in Washington.
After three years' captivity, Mr Strubig and Mr Kemptner were handed over
yesterday to Mr Bernd Schmidbauer, a special German envoy, in the office of
Mr Rashid Solh, Lebanese prime minister. It was the first time western
hostages were freed under the auspices of the Lebanese rather than the
Syrian government.
'The release of the German hostages closes the dark chapter of
hostage-taking in Lebanon forever,' said Mr Solh.
Mr Giandomenico Picco, the United Nations envoy principally responsible for
their liberation, said that contrary to earlier press reports, the two
Germans had been held by their kidnappers until yesterday morning.
The 'Holy Warriors for Freedom' led by Mr Abdul-Hadi Hamadi, an official of
the pro-Iranian Shia Moslem Hizbollah movement, fulfilled their promise to
liberate their captives within 48 hours of a statement issued on Monday.
Christopher Parkes adds from Bonn: The release clears the way for a visit to
Germany by Mr Ali Akbar Velayati, Iran's foreign minister. Mr Dieter Vogel,
the Bonn government spokesman, said economic links had already much improved
in the past year.

FT  18 JUN 92 / Ramos will require all his talents to turn this turmoil into
a victory: The past and future of the Philippines president-elect
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOSE GALANG
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AT THE start last February of his campaign for the presidency in the
Philippine election, Mr Fidel Ramos made an unannounced two-day trip to
Zurich. For several days after his return he refused to discuss it, and some
of his own supporters started to think that it might have mortally wounded
his bid for the nation's highest office.
There followed a wave of gossip that he had gone to Zurich to establish
links with the Swiss banking system, well-known to Filipinos for providing
sanctuary for funds being salted away by dictators, or that he was there for
a Valentine's Day tryst.
The cigar-chomping former general successfully deflected the issue (in fact
he had gone to woo support for the Philippines from the international group
of Christian Democratic parties) and went on to win the most hotly-contested
election in the Philippines.
Mr Ramos, aged 64, will need more of that talent for turning a crisis into a
victory when he assumes the presidency on June 30. Even now, the former
defence chief's election win is disputed by some of the losers who insist
there was massive fraud.
The Philippines does not need uncertainty at this time. Political stability,
Mr Ramos acknowledges, is crucial for the new administration to sustain a
nascent economic recovery from several years of coup attempts and natural
disasters.
Mr Ramos will find many allies in the business community. Several big names
in business openly backed his campaign. This was hardly surprising. In 1987
amid intense doubts over whether Mrs Corazon Aquino could last her term
because of incessant attacks by rebel groups in the military and by
communist insurgents, some businessmen were privately pushing for a
Ramos-led junta to provide a tougher hand in government.
Unlike his predecessor who inherited a bankrupt republic in 1986, Mr Ramos
will take over an economy that is, according to independent economists,
fundamentally sound although a widespread electric power shortage is a
severe handicap. It is on top of Mr Ramos's agenda in his first days in
office, according to aides.
Mrs Aquino's government reined in pre-election spending despite its open
support for Mr Ramos. As of late-May, according to Mr Jesus Estanislao, the
finance secretary, the national government had a budget surplus of 4.2bn
pesos (Pounds 97.7m). Interest rates, already down substantially from
early-1991 highs, could decline further as a result.
Inflation, hovering at 8 per cent, is likely to stabilise at its target of 7
per cent for the year. The exchange rate remains steady, as international
reserves remain high despite a surge in demand for dollars after the lifting
of the import levy on April 30.
For Mr Ramos, stability will translate into a 'continuity of policies' that
the Aquino administration adopted. This will include adherence to an
International Monetary Fund-supported economic stabilisation programme, on
which the Philippines' relations with the world financial community remains
hinged.
But 'stability' also has a negative connotation for Mr Ramos. During the
election campaign, his opponents interpreted his promises of stability as a
strong hand, and warned that he really meant to impose martial law to
silence critics and political opposition.
Opponents view him as another indecisive leader. As head of the paramilitary
Philippine Constabulary during Mr Marcos's martial rule, Mr Ramos has been
blamed for human rights violations traced to that group. The critics also
recall that in the August 1987 coup attempt against Mr Aquino, it took Mr
Ramos, then chief-of-staff of the armed forces, several hours to strike
back. Nonetheless, when he did, his troops snuffed out the rebellion in
hours.
During the campaign, Mr Ramos repeatedly 'guaranteed' that he would follow
the constitution in the exercise of his powers. But he says that his 'will
not be a wishy-washy, flip-flopping leadership'.
His 40-year experience in the military, he says, is just part of a
'well-rounded' government service. The military, he says, 'does not mean
only pulling triggers, it is also involved in community development' that
includes building roads and bridges in places that the private sector won't
go because of communist insurgents.
As a member of the Aquino cabinet until mid-1991, Mr Ramos was overseer of
all government development programmes for western Mindanao region, one of
the most depressed areas in the country. His motivation for 'people-oriented
undertakings', he says, was sharpened by that experience. He did well in
Mindanao provinces in the election.
Consensus-building, Mr Ramos also says, will be an important facet of his
administration. One of his first moves will be to form a council of economic
advisers, which will be composed mainly of private-sector leaders. He plans
to meet with this group once a month, to help him establish priorities
concerning business and the economy.
The result of Mr Ramos's trip to Zurich last February could come into play
in his foreign policy thrusts. Mr Ramos appears poised to seek expanded ties
with the European Community and with neighbours in Asia, as the Philippines
prepares for a diversification in its external relations after the
withdrawal of US military bases.
Reports from Washington yesterday indicated that US aid to the Philippines
would be reduced next year to a third of current amounts.

FT  18 JUN 92 / ANZ under pressure to pay Rs4bn
</HEADLINE>

   BOMBAY, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ANZ Grindlays, the Australian-owned bank, has been ordered by India's
central bank to pay Rs4bn (Pounds 77m) in the wake of the Bombay securities
scandal.
If it refuses to pay, ANZ risks losing its banking licence in India, where
it is one of the longest established foreign banks, with 56 branches and
post-tax profits of Rs350m last year.
The Reserve Bank of India's demand was made by Mr R. Janakiraman, deputy
governor, at a meeting in Bombay last night with Mr Bob Edgar, chief
executive of ANZ Grindlays.
The order follows a protracted dispute between the two sides over whether
ANZ has any liability to repay Rs4bn to the National Housing Bank, itself a
subsidiary of the Reserve Bank.
The NHB paid the money to ANZ with a series of cheques made out in ANZ's
name. The foreign bank paid the money into the current account of Mr Harshad
Mehta, a broker who has since been charged with fraud, even though it did
not have a specific instruction from NHB to do so. Mr Mehta used the money
to pay debts to the State Bank of India.
ANZ claims that it was acting in line with normal market practice in the
interbank securities market, and that all banks credited brokers accounts in
this way.
Pressure on ANZ has been increased by State Bank of India's decision to
repay Rs7bn to NHB on Tuesday. That money - not connected with the Rs4bn it
had received through ANZ - had also been credited to Mr Mehta's account
without the NHB's explicit authorisation.
The Reserve Bank has put pressure on ANZ in recent weeks to provide against
the possibility that it would have to repay the money to NHB. In response,
ANZ said it had set aside the funds in case it had to repay the money -
though it did not accept liability or say whether it had actually set up a
provision in its accounts.

FT  18 JUN 92 / Kashmir solution 'must get priority'

<TEXT>
MR NAWAZ SHARIF, prime minister of Pakistan, last week had a
'heart-to-heart' talk with his Indian counterpart, Mr PV Narasimha Rao. He
says he told Mr Rao that by spending large proportions of their budgets on
defence, they were depriving their people of basic rights.
During a visit to Britain following the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro -
where he met Mr Rao - Mr Sharif made clear in an interview that solution of
the problem of Kashmir, the disputed territory which is the cause of heavy
defence spending and two wars with India, carries the highest priority.
A cut in arms spending, which takes up nearly a third of Pakistan's budget,
would free resources for development and help to support Mr Sharif's radical
economic reforms. It would help India, which is attempting similar changes
to its economy, in the same way.
Mr Sharif has opened up the economy and begun a dialogue with India. But he
remains beset by domestic political opposition, and by unrest which has
prompted a military crackdown on violent crime in the southern province of
Sindh.
Pakistan is deprived of US aid because of its nuclear programme and has
proposed a five-nation conference - the US, Russia, China, India and
Pakistan - to discuss non-proliferation of nuclear weapons in the region.
India has refused to participate.
Mr Sharif said, however, that 'the nuclear problem will only be solved when
Kashmir is solved ..even if we solve the nuclear issue, the tensions will
not be resolved.'
Though Pakistani officials made clear that there was no attempt to impose
conditions by linking the issues, Mr Sharif said the need to have a large
defence capability arose precisely because of the Kashmir problem.
He said he drew Mr Rao's attention to atrocities being committed by the
Indian military in Indian-held Kashmir. 'The worst kind of violation of
human rights is being allowed to go on,' Mr Sharif said.
This was their fourth meeting, and though it underlined the quiet
improvement in their relations, it also followed an escalation of tension
this year: Pakistan was forced to halt two attempts by Kashmiris to cross
over into Indian-held Kashmir, and last month there was a round of
expulsions of diplomats.
If progress on Kashmir seems blocked, Mr Sharif's achievements on the
economic front are significant. Most exchange controls have gone, the budget
deficit has been cut, a liberal foreign investment law has been enacted,
some regulations have been removed and subsidies reduced.
A total of 54 industrial companies have been privatised as well as a number
of banks, and the aim is to privatise airlines, ports, shipping and
telecommunications. Mr Sharif says he hopes to make the rupee convertible
during his tenure. About Dollars 1bn (Pounds 540m) has flowed into foreign
exchange accounts in Pakistan, mostly from Pakistanis living abroad.
Mr Sharif will tomorrow address a London conference designed to attract
investment to Pakistan. Foreign investors and lenders, however, have been
put off by the uncertain political situation and by moves towards an
'Islamised' economy, in which the concept of interest is outlawed.
Partly because of international implications, the government has appealed
against a Shariat Court ruling that all transactions must be conducted
according to Islamic principles by June 30. The appeal will not be heard
until later in the year, thereby postponing that deadline.
Mr Sartaj Aziz, finance minister, says that 70 per cent of transactions are
now carried out on Islamic principles. Some Islamic scholars contend,
however, that the new accounts do not satisfy the principles.
Mr Sharif, apparently wishing to defuse the issue without losing political
support, says: 'All Islamic scholars agree that these are complex issues and
will take time. We need time to examine the implications.'
Gunmen have killed Mr Nazir Ahmed Siddique, the Kashmir carpet dealer who
negotiated the release of several prominent hostages seized by militants
fighting the Indian government, Reuter reports from Srinagar. No one
immediately admitted responsibility.

   HONG KONG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JIANG ZEMIN, secretary general of the Chinese Communist party, yesterday
ensured Mr Chris Patten, Hong Kong's governor designate, a bumpy
introduction to the colony when he warned against any interference with the
smooth transfer of sovereignty to China.
His comments come as Britain is under pressure from liberals in the colony
to press China to allow an increase in the number of elected seats in the
Legislative Council. Britain's agreement with China does not allow the
introduction of a fully democratic system.
Jiang's intervention, taken with the difficulties over the financing of the
colony's multi-billion dollar airport project, marks a significant raising
of the diplomatic temperature between Beijing, Hong Kong and London.
The impasse over the airport's financing is beginning to affect share prices
in Hong Kong. Confidence in Hong Kong is more than usually fragile and
brokers said that although they thought the project would proceed, the delay
was starting to take its toll on sentiment.
Mr Alan Lee, a member of the Executive Council, the colonial cabinet, met
Jiang yesterday with 19 of his conservative supporters, who like China, want
a smooth handover in 1997. Afterwards Mr Lee quoted the Chinese leader as
saying 'there should not be chaos but a smooth transfer of sovereignty with
a stable political system' in the colony.
By raising the issue of Hong Kong's politics at Jiang's level the Chinese
are indicating to London that it will face some hard talks on the issue of
local democracy. Britain has said it will take up with the Chinese the
question of more elected seats in the Legislative Council for the 1995
elections, and is expected to do so around the turn of the year.
But it is far from clear if Mr Patten will have the whole community behind
him when he raises the issue. As Mr Lee's visit to Beijing underlines, such
a move is losing support among conservative political interests in the
colony.
Mr Lee, who is also an unelected member of the legislature, has virtually
broken with the British government over its promise to approach China about
increasing the number of elected seats.
In London Baroness Dunn, the senior non-official Executive Council member,
indicated her disapproval with UK policy when she told a House of Lords
debate on Hong Kong yesterday that talk of more seats 'revives uncertainty,
tension and discord in our community.'
The Hong Kong branch of Beijing's Bank of China (BoC) is scheduled to issue
Hong Kong dollar bank notes in 1994, three years before the British colony
returns to China, a pro-Beijing newspaper reported yesterday, Reuter adds.

FT  18 JUN 92 / Maastricht: Britain wants the WEU to be given real military
capacity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT MAUTHNER, Diplomatic Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN called yesterday for the nine-nation Western European Union to be
given a genuine military capacity, in line with last year's Maastricht
agreement that the WEU should be the vehicle for developing European
defence.
Mr Malcolm Rifkind, UK defence secretary, says in an article before
tomorrow's meeting of WEU foreign and defence ministers that all members
should make available a wide range of their Nato and national assets for use
by the WEU. Such an approach had the advantage of avoiding the creation of
separate standing forces, which no member state could afford.
It also meant that the WEU would have a variety of forces to deal with a
variety of possible needs, from humanitarian to peace-keeping work.
Moreover, it would help to ensure that what was done in the WEU enhanced and
did not duplicate what was done in Nato.
The WEU needed, in particular, to identify which forces would be available
for use by the organisation. Britain had suggested that European
multinational formations such as the plan for a joint
Dutch-Belgian-German-British Nato division, or the UK/Netherlands Amphibious
Force, or the Franco-German corps, could be put at the disposal of the WEU.
However, in a thinly disguised reference to the Franco-German corps, Mr
Rifkind warned that there could be no question of a European country or
countries having permanent command of WEU forces. 'As in other areas of
European construction, we will have to share command and headquarters
roles.'

<TEXT>
BRITAIN'S AIM during its six-month presidency of the European Community
which begins on July 1 is to complete preparatory stages so that
negotiations with the next group of EC applicants can begin, Mr John Major,
prime minister, says in the foreword to the presidency programme published
yesterday.
He argues that the EC must not be an exclusive club. 'We want to extend the
benefits of membership to our fellow Europeans who share our values of
democracy and human rights, who have already well-established market
economies and who are ready to take on the obligations.'
While appearing to warn against unrealistic expectations, Mr Major sees the
half-year presidency as 'an opportunity for Britain to help shape the future
of Europe at a time of great change'.
The programme was unveiled in Edinburgh by Mr Ian Lang, Scottish secretary,
who said the main priority would be to run a 'businesslike and efficient'
presidency which would also show Britain's willingness to take its place at
the heart of Europe.
Out of 79 events being staged in the UK during the six months, 25 will be
held in Scotland, culminating in the EC heads of government summit in
Edinburgh on December 11-12. Only a handful of events will take place in
Wales and Northern Ireland, giving substance to the view that Mr Major is
anxious to foster a greater sense of UK unity within Scotland following
recent calls for independence.
As well as the Edinburgh summit, a conference on rural development takes
place in Inverness next month, and EC environment ministers meet at
Gleneagles in September, when EC ambassadors also visit Scotland. Other
dates include a meeting of transport ministers in Hertfordshire in July,
finance ministers in Bath in September, and agriculture ministers in
Cambridge also in September.
London is to host meetings of housing, justice and immigration ministers in
November and December, and apart from the EC-Japan meeting on July 4, other
summits may be staged between the EC and 'outside' states such as the US or
Canada.

FRANCE cleared another hurdle on the road to Maastricht in the early hours
of yesterday morning when the senate approved changes in the French
constitution required for ratification of the treaty.
Virtually all the Socialist, centrist and centre-right UDF members voted for
the revision, which was mainly opposed by the Gaullists and the Communists.
The one technical hitch is that the senate introduced detailed amendments to
the text passed by the national assembly. Since the constitution can only be
revised on the basis of identical texts, the senate version will go back to
the assembly today for a new vote.
However, the size of the senate majority (192 in favour and 117 against)
strengthens expectations that the government should be able to complete the
constitutional revision in its final parliamentary phase, a special congress
of the national assembly and the senate, in the palace of Versailles,
probably on June 29.
A three-fifths majority will be required at that meeting. This seems
entirely feasible, since the separate votes in the two houses of parliament
add up to a majority of just over 66 per cent. However, should the congress
fail, the government will submit the treaty for ratification in a referendum
in the autumn. Polls continue to suggest that the treaty would be approved.

FT  18 JUN 92 / Maastricht: If Ireland coughs, the rest of the EC is in for
a prolonged cold - A look at the options for the Community
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
IRELAND, as its prime minister, Mr Albert Reynolds, rightly said this week,
has the eyes of Europe, and many other countries, on it today.
If its referendum produces a majority, however slim, in favour of the
Maastricht treaty, the treaty lives on - at least for a while.
But, if Irish voters follow the Danes in rejecting Maastricht, even by a few
thousand votes, the pact for European political and monetary union will die
 -at least in its present form.
Then, a second set of options would open up for European Community: settle
for the current Treaty of Rome, try to renegotiate Maastricht, or let some
EC states move ahead of the rest to form an inner core of tighter
integration.
But there is no agreed contingency plan to deal with a second No, any more
than there was to deal with the first No. Denmark's 11 partners did move
speedily, after the vote on June 2, to affirm their intention to pursue
ratification of Maastricht, regardless.
In the event of a second No, there will be no such speed or unity.
On a very technical level, the Brussels lawyers still argue, Irish rejection
would not kill Maastricht. EC constitutional revisions must be ratified in
all member states, under the Rome treaty's terms. But there is no set time
limit.
EC leaders expressed the hope that Maastricht would be ratified this year.
Yet, the treaty itself only stipulates that it would enter into force on the
first day of the first month after the last member state ratified it. This,
theoretically, gives parliaments and peoples an open-ended period in which
to reverse any rejection.
But real life in the Community is not like that, of course.
An Irish No today would almost certainly lead to rejection in neighbouring
Britain, where Mr John Major, the prime minister, already has an
anti-Maastricht revolt on his back-benches, and prevent the Danes from
changing their minds.
Devising a special half-in, half-out status for Denmark is, or would be, bad
enough; creating such arrangement for two other countries as well would be a
nightmare.
The French and German governments might try to plug on with ratifying an
unchanged Maastricht treaty, as Chancellor Helmut Kohl indicated yesterday.
But both he and President Francois Mitterrand (for whom an Irish No would
vastly increase his risk in holding an autumn plebiscite on Maastricht)
would first have to sell to their publics the idea of a two-speed Europe.
Returning to an inner integrationist core of, perhaps, the original six
members of the Community - Germany, France, Italy and Benelux - might in
fact strike a popular chord among French, maybe even among Germans.
Yet, for Paris and Bonn simply to decide to forge ahead with a smaller club
of 'Maastricht-ers' would raise the question of how the Community is to
relate to the wider Europe.
For, also riding on today's vote in Ireland is the issue of enlargement,
whose institutional implications the Commission was wrangling with again
yesterday.
One thing is now sure. The EC executive will be now be far more modest than
it had planned in its report to next week's Lisbon summit about the
institutional consequences of enlargement.
Reports and misreports that Mr Jacques Delors, the Commission president, was
planning an all-powerful executive in Brussels to run a more numerous
Community boomeranged in the Danish referendum.
But before entry negotiations can start with any of the seven countries
which have now applied for EC membership, the applicants clearly need to
know, or be told, what they are joining.
The Maastricht commitment to a European union is the only current basis on
which Brussels can start preparing to open negotiations with at least
Austria, Sweden, Finland and Switzerland early next year.
If Irish voters give Maastricht a fresh lease of life today, but
ratification by other EC states drags on into 1993, it may still be
impossible to start enlargement negotiations on time.
'We couldn't start this with Maastricht unratified and our negotiating flank
exposed,' a senior Commission official said this week. 'We would find
applicant countries picking and choosing what they liked, and didn't like,
out of Maastricht.'
Laying the ground for enlargement talks early next year is a high, perhaps
the highest, priority of Britain's EC presidency in the second half of this
year.
If Irish voters were to vote Maastricht down today, finding any other basis
on which to negotiate enlargement would be very tricky and time-consuming.
That helps explain why Britain, which might otherwise hope to renegotiate a
less federalist version of Maastricht, sees merit in sticking to the
original.

THE DANISH government has confirmed that it will make no proposals to
resolve the political crisis surrounding the Maastricht treaty until its 11
partners have completed the ratification process.
Mr Anders Fogh Rasmussen, Denmark's economy minister, admitted that the
Danish government could not sign the treaty as it stood because of the No
vote in the recent referendum. But he pointed out that the treaty would not
be valid until the 11 - assuming they all ratify the treaty - asked the
Danish government to sign the document.
He predicted that the other 11 member countries would not put the crucial
question to Denmark.

THE FRAGILE ceasefire in the besieged Bosnian capital of Sarajevo collapsed
yesterday, dashing United Nations hopes of sending food and humanitarian aid
to the starving people of the city.
UN officials said the ceasefire ended at dawn after the city came under
fresh mortar and heavy bombardment from the surrounding hills, which are
held by Serb irregulars and Serbia's proxy Bosnian army.
Last night Serb irregulars were again pounding the city and its suburbs with
artillery, and the main government building was bombarded for several hours.
Street fighting moved towards the centre of Sarajevo as Serb irregulars and
Bosnian territorial defence units engaged in long and sustained battles for
control of parts of the city.
Eye witnesses reported that Serb irregulars had entered the suburb of
Dobrinja, near the airport and had taken many people from their apartments,
evidently to exchange them for captured Serb snipers.
A senior UN official in Belgrade, the Serbian capital, said it was too
dangerous for the UN to try to reopen Sarajevo airport for an airlift of
food and other supplies. He said a UN convoy that left Belgrade yesterday
morning with relief supplies was still blocked from entering Sarajevo.
'There is no water, no food, no electricity. There is no hope. There is only
fighting. We are being abandoned by the world community,' said Mr Ivan
Knezovic, a philosophy professor at Sarajevo university.
He said he was afraid that the Serb irregulars would eventually take
Sarajevo street by street, house by house.
UN officials had pinned great hopes on the ceasefire, as one of the last
chances to re-open the airport. Serb irregulars have blockaded the airport
for 11 weeks, preventing the city's 300,000 inhabitants from receiving any
food supplies.
'There is little chance now that Canadian troops will be sent to take over
control of the airport,' Mr Knezovic said.
The Serb irregulars, led by Mr Radovan Karadzic, and General Ratko Mladic,
agreed to a ceasefire last Sunday in the belief they could use a lull in the
fighting to consolidate their positions in the city and eventually divide
it. The Serb irregulars have repeatedly broken previous ceasefires.
But western diplomats said an agreement between Bosnian President Alija
Izetbegovic, and Croatian President Franjo Tudjman to form a military
alliance could have persuaded the Serb irregulars to abandon the Sarajevo
ceasefire.

<TEXT>
RUSSIA is asking other countries to allow in Russian 'guest workers' to
relieve the pressure of unemployment and earn hard currency.
A Russian minister said the 'traditional labour-accepting countries' of
Australia, Canada and the US had been approached to take quotas of Russian
workers.
The German embassy said that two programmes, one allowing a maximum of
11,000 Russian workers to come in under contracts with Russian companies
working in Germany and the other allowing 2,000 to work for 18 months to
acquire skills, were expected to be signed next month. There was no
intention, however, of signing further agreements.
The frank admission by Mr Igor Khalevinsky, a deputy Labour Minister, that
Russia is seeking to export labour to richer states after decades of
refusing exit visas shows growing concern at unemployment.

   TALLINN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ESTONIA will issue its own currency, the kroon, on June 20-22, becoming the
first former Soviet republic to abandon the rouble zone and introduce a
separate national currency.
The kroon is to be tied to the German D-Mark, with a 3 per cent fluctuation
band allowed. But its initial exchange rate against the D-Mark has yet to be
fixed, as has the rate for conversion of cash roubles into kroons.
The kroon is to be the only legal tender in Estonia and all hard currency
accounts will be converted into the new currency. But this could be a
problem if doubts about the kroon's convertibility arise. Estonia, with only
1.5m people, has just Dollars 120m in gold - as well as central bank-owned
stretches of forest - with which to back its currency.
Trade with the rouble zone could be seriously disrupted. An agreement for
clearing payments has been agreed only with Ukraine, but a draft treaty with
Russia, with which Estonia conducts over half its trade and from which it
gets vital fuel supplies, has not yet been signed.
Success or failure of the kroon will determine the course taken by other
former Soviet republics anxious to dump the 'occupation rouble'. Ukraine has
signalled that it will issue its own currency later this summer if the
Estonian move is successful.
Estonia's two Baltic neighbours, Latvia and Lithuania, have already taken
steps towards new currencies.

FT  18 JUN 92 / Italy ends crisis over PM: Amato asked to form government
after Craxi steps aside
</HEADLINE>

   By ROBERT GRAHAM

   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Oscar Luigi Scalfaro last night announced that he would formally
invite Mr Giuliano Amato, a former Socialist finance minister, to be the
51st Italian prime minister since the war.
A seemingly impossible deadlock over the choice of a new prime minister
following the April 5 election was unblocked yesterday morning when Mr
Bettino Craxi, the Socialist leader, agreed to withdraw his candidature for
the premiership.
In stepping down, Mr Craxi proposed three fellow Socialists who were
considered more likely to gain the support of possible coalition partners.
Mr Amato, a law professor and highly respected in parliament as a senior
member of the Socialist Party, was from the outset the most likely candidate
once Mr Craxi withdrew.
Mr Amato is in charge of a special party commission looking into the Milan
municipal corruption scandal.
Though using guarded language, Mr Scalfaro made it clear that the next prime
minister would need to reflect the reality of the large protest vote against
the coalition of Christian Democrats, Socialists, Social Democrats and
Liberals in the April 5 election.
The candidate also had to reflect the need for clean government in the wake
of the corruption scandals.
President Scalfaro is also anxious to see a slimmed down government and the
likely emphasis will be on technical competence rather than party loyalty.
This effectively excluded Mr Craxi, who based his election campaign on a
renewal of the four-party coalition and whose image has been damaged by his
links to party members involved in the Milan scandal.
It was not clear whether Mr Craxi decided to stand down on his own
initiative or was persuaded to do so by Mr Scalfaro. Mr Craxi, prime
minister from 1983 to 1987, had assumed before the elections he would get
the job, backed by the Christian Democrats.
Until now he has insisted on being the Socialists' candidate for the
premiership despite growing dissent within the party and lukewarm support
from the Christian Democrats.
His insistence also blocked much-needed support from the small Republican
party or the former communist Party of the Democratic Left (PDS).
The immediate Christian Democrat reaction was favourable. The party has
recognised that, with one of their number newly elected as president, a
likely balance was a Socialist prime minister.
Equally important, the PDS appeared willing to back a Socialist prime
minister and shifted the emphasis to the nature of the next government's
programme.
A prominent Socialist in northern Italy Renato Amorese, killed himself after
going to see authorities investigating a major city hall corruption scandal
in Milan, police said yesterday.

FT  18 JUN 92 / EC agrees E German shipyard aid deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL and LESLIE COLITT

<DATELINE>
   LUXEMBOURG, BERLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EC industry ministers last night agreed controversial European Commission
proposals to cut capacity in the ailing east German shipbuilding industry by
40 per cent.
The deal will be backed by safeguards to prevent the rest of the EC industry
being undercut by subsidised east German competitors. The agreement should
allow the Treuhand to sell off some yards to private companies.
The restructuring programme, which began after German unification, will
eventually have cost 25,000 shipbuilding jobs in east Germany.
Under the Commission plans, Bonn can provide operating aid up to 36 per cent
of the yards' estimated turnover after restructuring.
The exact amount of aid will be adjusted for each yard according to a
complex formula. Subsidies have to be paid before the end of 1993, in
exchange for drastic cuts in capacity by 1995.
French, Spanish and Italian ministers had been pressing for capacity cuts of
as much as 57 per cent. They held out for assurances that the aid level
would be strictly observed and supported by safeguards for their own
shipyards, which are subject to a general EC ceiling on production aid of 9
per cent.
The future of the east German shipyards is a highly sensitive political
issue in Germany. Yesterday's meeting of ministers in Luxembourg was lobbied
by shop stewards of the German yards and mayors of ports of the region of
Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, where shipbuilding accounts for 40 per cent of
industrial employment.
Only yards which opened before October 1990 will be eligible for the
subsidies.
The Commission plan has to be approved by the European Parliament.
The EC decision came as forecasts for early recovery of the East German
economy were scaled down.
The German government and some economists had predicted a recovery beginning
this summer, but the Federation of Berlin and Brandenburg Employers (UVB)
said yesterday that reports from companies showed it was still far off.
In one of the most sombre assessments yet of east Germany's prospects, Mr
Hartmann Kleiner, head of the UVB, said he expected that by next year only
15 per cent of nearly 4m industrial workers in east Germany in 1990 would
still have jobs.

THE CRISIS shaking the Czechoslovak federation intensified yesterday when Mr
Vaclav Klaus, federal prime minister designate, announced he would head his
own Czech republic instead.
Mr Klaus, who as federal finance minister masterminded post-communist
reforms, was charged by President Vaclav Havel with forming a new federal
government after his party won greatest support in this month's elections.
Meeting newly elected Slovak leaders for a third round of negotiations, Mr
Klaus said he did not 'put much faith in a new federal state'.
The future of the Czechoslovak federation has been put into question since
the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS) won 37 per cent of the vote in
the Slovak republic. The nationalist HZDS has pledged to declare Slovak
sovereignty and adopt a Slovak constitution in the republic's new parliament
when it meets at the end of the month.
The two sides agreed yesterday to form a minimal federal government but
remained deadlocked over the division of ministerial posts within it.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CONSTRUCTION across a recession-hit western Europe is likely to fall by
about 3 per cent this year with only a slight improvement expected next
year, judging by forecasts from 13 countries published yesterday in
Helsinki.
The forecasts compiled by Euro-Construct foresee the biggest falls in
housing and private sector commercial property development, both hit by high
interest rates and sluggish economic growth.
Worst affected have been Scandinavia and Britain, where the collapse of
property markets has been greatest.
In Germany rebuilding the former communist-controlled eastern part of the
country is placing an increasing strain on investment elsewhere in the
economy. The value of construction output in constant prices is expected to
rise by only 1.5 per cent this year and by 1 per cent next year.
Forecasts available from Euro-Construct, Millbank Tower, Room 1214,
Millbank, London SW1P 4QX, price: Pounds 250.

FT  18 JUN 92 / Lawyer details Maxwell assets: No 'pot of gold' in
Liechtenstein operations, warns foundation chief
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   VADUZ
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE LAWYER heading the secretive Maxwell Foundation in Liechtenstein
yesterday pledged to exert his control over Maxwell companies beyond the
reach of British administrators to try to provide funds for Maxwell
pensioners.
Mr Werner Keicher, who controls one of the key holding companies of the
Maxwell empire, told a press conference in Vaduz: 'The problem of the
pension funds and the fate of the (Maxwell) pensioners disturbs me greatly.'
Although he warned that there was no hidden 'pot of gold' in the
Liechtenstein operations, Mr Keicher said the foundation had been set up for
charitable purposes: 'Why should they (the pensioners) not receive money'?
He wants the companies under his control to continue to operate and to pay
dividends. He will seek to have these paid to benefit pensioners.
In a rare example of openness in the secretive world of Liechtenstein
stiftungs (trusts), Mr Keicher detailed the foundation's assets and
objectives. He also promised to co-operate with investigators seeking to
trace the movement of assets throughout the Maxwell business empire.
At the same press conference, Dr Kamil Braxator, legal representative of
Allgemeines Treu - unternehmen - which employs lawyers as trustees to many
funds - said trusts he represented that had been named in connection with Mr
Robert Maxwell included Alandra, Baccano, Kiara, Jungo, Corry and Akim.
He said he was investigating their assets, which included more than 10m
shares in Maxwell Communication Corporation and Mirror Group Newspapers, the
two publicly-quoted companies in the Maxwell empire. Trading in both of
these companies' shares is suspended and their value is likely to be
minimal.
He said none of the trusts had any cash, and the shares registered to them
were held outside Liechtenstein. They had been 'donated' through Goldman
Sachs, the US investment bank used by the late Robert Maxwell to purchase
shares as part of an alleged share price support operation. Dr Braxator was
still trying to determine other assets.
Mr Keicher said current charitable beneficiaries of the Maxwell Foundation
did not include any members of the Maxwell family. 'Mr Kevin Maxwell will
never get a cent out of this foundation,' he said.
Yesterday's press conference was a strange gathering for Liechtenstein,
which derives business from its reputation as a secretive haven for assets.
Mr Keicher answered questions from journalists in English and German for
more than two hours. He said the Maxwell Foundation held about SFr3,000
(Pounds 1,100) in cash, an unspecified number of shares in MCC  - currently
in administration - and 100 per cent of the shares of Swico Anstalt Vaduz,
another Liechtenstein holding company.
Swico, in turn, owned 89 per cent of Sphere, a Californian computer games
company, as well as 100 per cent of PH (US) Inc, an American investment
company now under investigation for receiving money from Maxwell public
companies. It also owned Yakosa Finanzierungs AG, a Swiss trust under
investigation for part of an alleged MCC share price support scheme.
Swico also has minority holdings in Robert Maxwell Group, parent of MGN,
Headington Investments, the ultimate UK holding company, and PHA
Investments, a secretive investment company. Swico held about Pounds 4,000
in cash.
Mr Keicher said he had refused requests to use MCC shares held by the
foundation as collateral for loans. Requests came in the last two years from
Mr Werner Rechsteiner, a Swiss lawyer who controls Servex, a trust which
received MCC shares that have been linked to alleged share support
operations.

FT  18 JUN 92 / Lloyd's may give up plan to bail out Names
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PLANS TO set up a bailout fund to help those Lloyd's Names hardest hit by
recent losses are running into difficulties and may be abandoned.
An emergency meeting of the Lloyd's council, the market's governing body,
was held yesterday to discuss a number of possible schemes.
The council will make an announcement today, and some form of help for
stricken Names is not entirely ruled out. However, a Lloyd's official
admitted that a bailout plan was 'looking less and less likely'.
The purpose of a bailout would be to cap the losses of those Names - the
individuals whose assets support underwriting - who have been worst affected
by Lloyd's recent losses. These are forecast to reach Pounds 2bn in the 1989
underwriting year. In line with Lloyd's three-year accounting system, these
figures will be announced next week. Officials working on the scheme are
understood to have been unable so far to solve complex legal and practical
difficulties.
A minority of the market's Names, who are members of 'spiral' reinsurance
syndicates - which provided high-level catastrophe cover to other syndicates
and companies - face a disproportionate share of losses.
Chatset, the company which tracks the results of Lloyd's syndicates, says
that Names on just 15 of the 401 syndicates trading could face losses of
Pounds 948m.
Any decision not to help them would be bound to stir controversy ahead of
the society's annual meeting next week.
Mr Christopher Stockwell, the chairman of the Lloyd's Names Associations
working party, warned that the market's crisis could deepen if no help was
offered. He predicted an 'an enormous wave of litigation' by Names in the
autumn.
'The council may duck the issue but our basic belief and expectation is that
something has to be done. Failure is the end of Lloyd's,' he added.
The idea of a bailout plan has had a chequered history over recent months.
In January, a task force under the chairmanship of Mr David Rowland,
chairman of international broker Sedgwick, recommended against retrospective
aid for Names, restricting its proposed cap on losses for future years. In
April, Mr David Coleridge, chairman, revived the idea of offering help to
the market's 'walking wounded' and a council sub-committee has examined
various options over the past two months.
Although the idea has found favour among some sections of the market,
neither agents nor brokers have been enthusiastic about contributing funds
to a scheme.
The mood among underwriters and agents at the Lloyd's market has shifted in
the past few weeks against setting up such a fund. This change of mood
follows the approval of plans to boost the size of Lloyd's central fund,
which meets losses when Names cannot pay claims.

FT  18 JUN 92 / NY Daily News 'was conduit for funds'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN FRIEDMAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR KEVIN MAXWELL is alleged to have used the New York Daily News as a
conduit to transfer funds from Maxwell companies in London to banks and
companies around the world.
According to newly obtained court documents filed by the Daily News, the
transactions were outside 'the ordinary course' of the newspaper's business.
The newspaper, bought by Mr Robert Maxwell in March 1991, has named Mr
Maxwell's son Kevin as having 'authorised and directed' the fund transfers
between March 21, 1991 and November 29, 1991.
The other person named as directing the transfers was Mr Robert Maxwell
himself, who died on November 5 last year.
The issue of the fund transfers is the subject of a legal dispute in the US
between the Daily News and other parties, including Mirror Group Newspapers
of the UK. MGN was floated in the UK by the Maxwell empire last May.
The Daily News court submission was made in answer to a question about its
financial affairs by the New York bankruptcy court. The newspaper filed for
bankruptcy protection last December.
The submission alleges that, from March to November 1991, the UK funds were
received by the Daily News 'and transferred to various entities in virtually
simultaneous transactions'.
The Daily News added that the funds served 'no business purpose' of their
own and that the newspaper was 'utilised merely as a conduit by Robert
Maxwell or his affiliated companies or family members for such transfers'.
The Daily News is itself being accused in the US court of aiding and
abetting a conspiracy to defraud MGN of Pounds 50m.
The Daily News, which has denied any wrongdoing, faces claims from MGN and
from the UK administrators of the Maxwell private companies for a total of
more than Dollars 200m (Pounds 110m) of Maxwell fund transfers.
This money came to the Daily News from both private and public Maxwell
companies in the UK and elsewhere.
It was learnt last night that Britain's Serious Fraud Office is
investigating a Pounds 50m transfer from MGN to the Daily News that occurred
on October 21, 1991.
Court documents filed by MGN this week in the US concerning the Pounds 50m
transfer accuse the Daily News of being liable for fraud, aiding and
abetting conspiracy to defraud and aiding and abetting MGN directors in a
breach of their fiduciary duties.
The court filing also asserts that both Mr Robert Maxwell and Mr Michael
Stoney, the former deputy MGN managing director in charge of finance, were
responsible for the misappropriation of MGN funds and a violation of their
fiduciary duties to MGN.
The filing also says that Mr Stoney drew down the Pounds 50m - which was
borrowed by MGN from the London office of Bankers Trust - upon the orders of
Mr Robert Maxwell.
Mr Stoney was moved by Mr Robert Maxwell to MGN in the spring of 1991.

FT  18 JUN 92 / Chancellor pledges to stand firm on tight economic policy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN and EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE government pledged yesterday to stick to its economic policy of low
inflation and sound public finance enshrined in the Maastricht treaty, in
spite of the Danish rejection of European economic and monetary union.
Speaking shortly after the release of mildly encouraging industrial
production and retail sales data, Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, held out
the prospect of 'lower pay settlements leading to lower earnings growth'.
British industry was entering a 'virtuous circle of low inflation, rising
competitiveness and increasing market share', he said.
Talking to Surrey businessmen, the chancellor indicated that such
achievement could take some time. He drew a parallel between conditions in
the UK and France, which in 1983 embarked on a tough counter-inflationary
policy. France now has one of the industrial world's lowest inflation rates,
but an unemployment rate of close to 10 per cent.
In France, 'years of tight monetary and fiscal policy . . . are beginning to
pay off,' the chancellor said.
'It has been done the difficult way. But that is the only way. And there is
absolutely no reason why we in Britain cannot do the same.'
Mr Lamont did nothing to encourage recent speculation that the government
might be planning to cut UK bank base rates from their present 10 per cent.
Instead, he reaffirmed its determination to take sterling 'in due course'
into the narrow band of the European exchange rate mechanism (ERM), at a
rate of DM2.95.
While he was careful not to commit the UK to eventual membership of a single
European currency zone, he stressed Britain's commitment to the ERM and the
economic convergence criteria of the Maastricht treaty.
The 'conquest of inflation' was permanently at the centre of UK economic
policy, he said. The government was beginning to break the inflation-prone
mentality that had 'dogged Britain for decades', he added.
The chancellor admitted that the past 18 months had been 'extremely
difficult'.
However, Mr Lamont predicted that, 'in two or three years' time', people
would look back and see that the right decisions had been taken.
While emphasising that government policy was not determined by monthly
statistics, Mr Lamont nonetheless said he was encouraged by yesterday's news
that manufacturing output had risen in April for the third successive month
and that retail sales had increased slightly in May.
According to official figures from the Central Statistical Office,
manufacturing output showed a broadly based increase of 1 per cent in the
three months to April 30, compared with the previous three months,
indicating that this part of the economy might be pulling out of recession.
The news from the high street was less encouraging and provided further
proof that the Tory election victory had failed to trigger a spending boom.
Consumers were reluctant to spend in the face of rising unemployment and
depressed conditions on the housing market.
Compared with the previous three months, retail sales volumes were virtually
unchanged in the three months to May 31 and were down 0.3 per cent against
the same period a year ago.
Financial markets showed a mixed reaction to yesterday's news. Sterling
closed 1 pfennig higher at DM2.925 after the chancellor's reaffirmation that
the pound would enter the ERM narrow band.
However, Mr Lamont's hardline policy stance offset any comfort that the
equity market might have drawn from the manufacturing and sales figures. The
FT-SE 100 index of leading shares closed at 2,598.4, down 17.9 points.

FT  18 JUN 92 / Telecommunications In Business (27): Still only the tip of
the iceberg - Chargecards
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK NEWMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IF your wallet is already bulging with bank cards and your head has been
tied in knots by different personal identification numbers, you might not
take kindly to BT's suggestion that your life would be made easier with one
of its Chargecards.
But this is the message that Beattie has been putting over to television
audiences for the past year. And judging by Chargecard subscriptions, the
message has been getting through.
BT has supplied 700,000 Chargecards since January 199I, having distributed
only 500,000 cards in the previous five years following its launch in 1986.
BT believes that this is still only the tip of the iceberg. It wants people
to view the Chargecard as an extension of their home or office, using it to
access other services such as voice or electronic mail and facsimile.
Mr Tony Vardy, BT's director of service development, acknowledges that most
people still associate Chargecards with public payphones. The point that
Beattie was making in her Chargecard commercial is that you can use the
Chargecard from any phone and the call will automatically be billed to your
home or office account.
In the advert, Beattie wanted to make a call from a clothes shop and had to
reassure the shop assistant that using the shop's private phone did not mean
that it would have to pay.
Chargecards are free, like credit cards used to be. They look like bank
cards, with the cardholder's name, his or her account number and an expiry
date.
When you need to make a call, you dial 144 on those phones which have number
pads, and get recorded message which asks you to tap in your PIN, and
proceed to make your call.
Calls made with a Chargecard are billed at the same rate as public
payphones, which is more than if the call is made from your home or office.
When BT first launched its Chargecard service, calls had to be routed via a
BT operator. If you still have a phone that uses the old dial mechanism, you
still have to use an operator. This makes the Chargecard more expensive and
slower than using the new system.
Increasingly, BT is looking to the Chargecard to increase its revenues from
people calling home while they are away on business or on holiday. Abroad,
the card can be used in the same way as in the UK. It can avoid problems of
finding the right coins to make calls, and can save money for those people
who usually make calls from hotels - which often charge four to five times
the standard rate.
The Chargecard can be used from 63 countries around the world, but it is not
yet possible to call a third country using a Chargecard. If you were in
Milan and needed to make a call to Paris, you would either have to use a
public payphone or phone from your hotel room.
However, three American telephone companies, American Telephone and
Telegraph, Sprint and MCI, have launched services for third party calling
for their American chargecard customers in the past few weeks. BT hopes to
start offering a similar facility to its Chargecard customers this summer.
It will be called UK Direct.
The improved ease of use and the new UK Direct service have combined to make
the Chargecard a more attractive service than when it first came out. But
there is one aspect of the service that is giving considerable cause for
concern both for BT and other operators of chargecard services.
Fraud affects BT's Chargecard service as much as it does banks with credit
cards. When a Chargecard call is made, the caller has to tap in his PIN on a
number pad in the same way as you would enter enter your PIN number at a
cash dispenser.
If someone sees the number you are dialling, he can use it to make calls
that will be charged to your account without even needing to use the card.
At airports and railway stations where there are likely to be a number of
Chargecard users, fraud has become big business and when a PIN is obtained,
it is rapidly passed on to a number of people ready and waiting to make
costly overseas calls.
BT reckons it has cut down fraud by 'putting up warning flags' when a
Chargecard holder makes calls that do not coincide with his normal calling
patterns. But fraud is still a worry and will have to be eliminated if users
are to have the confidence to use Chargecards for new services that often
involve sending and receiving sensitive commercial information.
The Chargecard is not the only piece of plastic that can be used to make
calls. Both BT and Mercury Communications, its domestic rival, have pre-paid
phone cards as an alternative to coins.
Calls can also be made with credit cards and an agreement between BT and
Visa last month means that the benefits of the Chargecard will be extended
to owners of Visa cards worldwide at the start of next year.
Part of the thinking behind this is that 'people who come to the UK don't
make anywhere near as many phone calls as we'd like them to,' according to
Mr Vardy. The VisaPhone service, as it is called, will permit visitors from
abroad to make calls from telephones in the UK which will be billed to their
Visa card in the local currency.
BT may embark on similar ventures with other leading credit card companies
in the future. But BT still sees itself 'working with, rather than competing
against, credit cards,' according to Mr Vardy, and will not follow the
example of American Telephone and Telegraph in the US which has set up a
joint venture with American Express to supply cards that combine the
functions of chargecards and credit cards.

FT  18 JUN 92 / Telecommunications In Business (26): Fierce battle among
global players - 'Super-carriers' target corporate communications sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLIAMSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
With the announcement last year of its US-headquartered Syncordia venture,
the UK's BT fired the first shot in what experts say will become an
increasingly ferocious battle for the private telecommunications business of
the world's leading global corporations.
The international private telecommunications sector is valued at nearly
Dollars 3bn and is growing annually at between 15 per cent and 20 per cent.
Ironically, this market came into being in the first place as a result of
the failure of public network operators to provide adequate solutions to the
specialised communications needs of large corporate users. Now the public
carriers are trying to claw back this lucrative business.
Based in Atlanta, Georgia, Syncordia was originally intended to marry the
talents of BT with those of its German and Japanese counterparts, Deutsche
Bundespost Telekom (DBT) and Nippon Telegraph and Telephone (NTT).
The plan was that this 'super-carrier' would divide up the leading US,
European and Asian Pacific markets between its members, offering
'outsourced' packages for the management of existing private networks, and
the construction and operation of new ones.
As well as end-to-end management and round-the-clock, multi-lingual customer
help-desks in a number of centres around the world, Syncordia's repertoire
was to be extended to include international cashless calling, worldwide
private numbering and mobile services for corporate users.
'We have great ambitions for Syncordia,' said BT chairman Iain Vallance at
the company's launch. 'We intend to be the leading providers of outsourced
networking services and we intend to set the industry standard for those
services.'
The ambitions remain, but the effort to expand Syncordia's membership did
not pan out as its progenitors intended. While discussions about NTT's
membership continue, DBT has broken away and, with France Telecom, formed a
rival enterprise known as Eunetcom. BT is now in discussion with one of the
US long distance carriers with a view to replacing DBT.
Some observers believe that additional partners are vital to establish
Syncordia's credibility with the biggest of the corporations it is
targeting. Bert Roberts, president of the US carrier MCI, argues that any
outsourcing venture will fail in the all-important US market if it does not
include a US partner.
A different view is taken by some of BT's senior management who think that
BT can go it alone in Syncordia. No doubt Syncordia's recent success in
picking up a reported Dollars 30m contract to manage some of IBM's European
data network business, together with the handled by BT's existing,
solely-owned international managed network business, dubbed Global Network
Services (GNS), lends some weight to this belief. Two new additions to the
GNS client list are the Gillette Company and JP Morgan.
Regardless of whether Syncordia has one owner or several, achieving success
in the outsourcing marketplace will require cast-iron commitment and a very
persuasive sales pitch.
Potential competition is on the increase. Not only are general purpose
carrier alliances forming, including Eunetcom and the Swedish-Dutch
enterprise called Unisource, but industry-specific partnerships are looking
at wider possibilities.
One such is the Financial Network Association (FNA). This was formed by
twelve carriers in March to offer a range of private and public services to
the international banking and finance sectors.
Belgacom, the Belgian carrier which could sign up with Unisource after the
middle of the year, is a founding FNA member. Belgacom director and chief
engineer Joris Claereboudt believes that the lessons FNA learns in servicing
the financial community could later be applied to other types of user.
Another contender is the Scitor subsidiary of the airline telecommunications
service organisation, Societe Internationale de Telecommunication
Aeronautiques, (SITA).
Set up in April, it is now offering managed data network services alongside
its portfolio of value-added services and electronic messaging products.
As the number of players on the field increases, the potential for business
failures in the outsourcing sector will grow. This may prevent some would-be
corporate customers from farming out their network operations until the
sector is better understood . . . and less populated.
Undoubtedly, Syncordia and other super-carrier outsourcers will be able to
tweak their rates and system features to be highly competitive with those of
privately-run networks. They will also have superior resources to resolve
the increasingly complex technical and contractual telecommunications
choices facing businesses operating internationally.
However, many telephone companies still suffer something of a credibility
gap with their would-be customers. In a survey of 20 large international
corporations and organisations carried out by the UK's Yankee Group
consultancy two years ago, some of the respondents already used third
parties, such as GE Information Services and Infonet to provide certain
network services and resources, but none was prepared at that time to
outsource any significant portion of network management to a public
telecommunications carrier.
One user summed up the view of those who were sympathetic to outsourcing:
'We're interested in sharing management (with a third party), but it would
have to be cost-effective, and we'd have to keep enough people to ensure we
knew when the suppliers were lying to us . . . and we'd have to be able to
take back control at short notice if we felt that was necessary . .
'We don't really expect to see carriers develop this capability for another
five years.'
As well as overcoming scepticism about their competence, carriers must sell
the outsourcing concept initially to corporate communication managers, a
body of individuals whose status, if not livelihood, could be adversely
affected by the decision to buy outsourced services.
Some consultants have queried the basis of the super carriers' stated
business case. In addition to recognising that not all the players currently
trying to enter the global services market will succeed, a new report from
the UK's Analysys consultancy advises caution on the part of putative
customers.
Susan Ablett, the report's lead author, says that the pace of technological
change and re-regulation '. . . means that long-term agreements negotiated
now may not be to the advantage of the user within a matter of one or two
years.'
As the Syncordia experience demonstrates, the construction of super-carrier
alliances is not necessarily straightforward. Klaus Grewlich, director
general of the DBT's international affairs department, has noted that some
carriers are competing with each other to provide end-to-end services for
some global customers, and trying to co-operate with each other to bring the
optimum spread of services to other customers. With a degree of
understatement, Grewlich characterises this delicate balancing act as
'stimulating.'
Last, but not least, the super-carrier idea faces an uncertain regulatory
future. In 1989 the European Commission's Directorate General IV (which is
responsible for preventing unnecessary restriction of competition through
monopoly or cartel creation), forced the cancellation of the MDNS managed
data alliance planned by 22 European telephone companies.
More recently, the same body has required the Infonet data operation, which
is jointly owned by some of Europe's leading carriers, to open its accounts
for public inspection to ensure that it is not in receipt of cross subsidies
which give it an unfair commercial advantage.
So far, regulatory intervention in the super-carrier marketplace has been a
European phenomenon.
The odds are that this will not be the case for much longer.

FT  18 JUN 92 / Telecommunications In Business (23): Milestone for
integrated services - ISDN / After twelve years of promises and many missed
deadlines, it looks as if ISDN, the Integrated Services Digital Network,
really will be 100 per cent deliverable throughout the UK by the end of
1992, as a full national dial-up, integrated voice and data service
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
THE important milestone for ISDN in Britain will be reached when all BT
switching centres are digitised and the so-called C7 signalling programme
has been completed, with Mercury and BT ISDN networks fully interconnected.
Another milestone will be reached in 1993 when the Normes Europeennes des
Telecommunications (Net) ISDN standard is implemented, creating one common
European ISDN network with all systems operating to the same set of
regulations. This will enabled companies to use the same ISDN equipment
throughout Europe.
ISDN is available to all businesses in France, Germany, Japan and Singapore.
In the UK, it is available to 86 per cent of businesses and 78 per cent of
homes, with users currently able to connect to 24 networks in 16 countries.
In the US, according to Bellcore, availability now is 40 per cent of all
phone lines, with 60 per cent not expected to be reached until 1994.
But while some say ISDN is one of the most important developments in
telecommunications since Alexander Graham Bell invented the telephone,
sceptics say it is a solution looking for a problem and will take up to 10
years before it is accepted by the wider community, if ever.
Take-up has been slow to date but, without the all-important infrastructure,
that was to be expected. Many potential suppliers argue, however, that the
problem is a deeper one.
As Don Winston, general manager and vice president of modem manufacturers,
Microcom UK points out: 'Take-up of ISDN will not happen until it can offer
customers benefits they do not already have, or something they have but for
less money.
At the moment, it does neither. As a result, the dial-up modem business is
still growing by 25 per cent a year, with modems capable of transmitting
data at 57.6kbps (kilobits per second), not far off ISDN's 64kbps.
'When the CCITT (the Comite Consultatif International Telephone et
Telegraphe) has finalised the V Fast standard, transmission times will be
pushing close to 100kbps. If ISDN is the way to the future, why are such
techniques even being considered?'
Reid Meintzer, director of sales and marketing at dealerboard suppliers, IPC
Information Systems, believes lack of enthusiasm for ISDN among
communications managers in the City of London is largely the fault of
manufacturers who rushed into the marketplace with products that were not
ready.
His point is echoed by Peter Edmondson, product development manager of fax
suppliers, Canon UK, who also lays the blame partly at the door of the
media: 'Over the past 4-5 years, expectations have been raised too high. It
is almost here now and it is a useful practical tool, if there is an
application for it. The point about ISDN is not that it can be used for data
communications without the need for a modem, but that it provides the
infrastructure to support a whole new generation of integrated computer and
communications applications, enabling us to communicate in ways we have not
even dreamt about yet.'
The ISDN connection
An ISDN connection is made up of two types of communication channel: bearer
channels (called B-channels), each offering 64Kbps capacity transmission
rates to carry information from terminal to terminal; and 16kbps signalling
channels (called D-channels) that carry the messages that establish and
control the call.
Primary Rate ISDN30, also called 30B+D in Europe (23B+D in the US), is used
mainly for voice calls by large companies with advanced telephone systems
(ISPBXs) and provides a 2mbps (megabits per second) interface to the digital
network.
Facilities and applications
ISDN2 and ISDN30 both offer certain facilities that are not possible on the
conventional PSTN (public switched telephone network). They include calling
line ID; sub-addressing for routing calls to a particular terminal; call
diversion; and three-way calling.
However, before making an investment in either service, businesses would
need to justify the application. For the true benefit of ISDN is not simply
that it offers improved features, higher quality speech and more
sophisticated routing and connections; or even that it offers higher speed,
error-free file transfer with high speed call setup.
Its advantage is that one network can support multiple applications, with
users able to transmit speech, data, graphics and video communications over
a single line and to plug any type of terminal into one type of socket.
Up to eight terminals can be connected to each ISDN2 line, with two items
able to communicate simultaneously. Also because one network can be used for
multimedia applications, rather than two or three different networks, time
and cost spent on network management and maintenance is reduced.
ISDN, together with intelligent switch software, also enables the creation
of sophisticated services such as virtual private networks (VPNs).
New equipment
A range of equipment is now being made available by equipment suppliers,
often with assistance from BT on issues such as standards, approvals and
marketing.
On the BT list of companies which can supply Terminal Adapters (TAs) with
full BABT approval are Craycom, Dataflex, Fivemere, Gandalf, Gravacom, IBM,
Jaguar and Newbridge Networks.
Slot-in line cards which transform personal computers into ISDN terminals
are available from Fujitsu, Maxim Networks and Network Designers. Group 4
fax machines are available from BT, HCS Infotec and Ricoh.
Video-conferencing is available from BT, GPT and PictureTel.
There are a number of collaborative ventures under way to supply
multifunction and multimedia ISDN-compatible terminals. Olivetti and BT, for
example, have signed a joint development agreement which will address the
needs of banks and financial institutions, with trials starting this summer
in the UK and other European countries.
Telecoms system manufacturer GPT has worked with modem manufacturer Hayes
Microcomputer Products to produce the Connect ISDN terminal which offers
plug-in connection for personal computers.
This makes it possible for any machine with a serial port to transmit down
an ISDN 2 line at 38kbps; with an optional X21 interface making possible PC
transmission at full 64kbps, as well as Group 4 fax or videophone
transmissions.
Modem manufacturer Dataflex Design and Symicron have collaborated to provide
an ISDN TA that offers X25 connection to ISDN 2 service from a standard PC
card. Not content just to announce an ISDN product, Dataflex Design ran
tests at a public exhibition to compare the times taken to transfer a
50,000-byte data file desktop to desktop over the two main networks.
Using various modems for connection to the PSTN, it took between 26 seconds
and four minutes to transfer the data plus up to one minute to establish a
satisfactory link. With V24 TAs over a BT ISDN2 link, it took 15 seconds
plus one second to establish a constant error-free link.
For users sending data files on a regular basis, the transmission cost
savings could be substantial, despite the premium paid for the ISDN
connection. Keen to encourage more business users to move over to ISDN, BT
has just launched a range of low-cost TAs manufactured by Northern Telecom,
priced at around Pounds 1,395.
Aimed at small businesses, telecommuters, retail outlets and educational
establishments, they will allow users to connect personal computers,
point-of-sale terminals, LAN servers, multiplexers, fax and
video-conferencing equipment to the ISDN network without having to re-invest
in new equipment.
Power computer users
Sun Microsystems is targeting the power computer users in the fields of
engineering and design with their new SPARCstation 10. While it is not the
first-ever integrated data/voice workstation, it is said to be the first of
a new generation of desktop systems with built-in ISDN capabilities.
The reason for the development is that Sun believes ISDN will become as
prevalent as Ethernet is today and is, thus, the logical choice for
integrating computers and telephones into a global, standardised digital
network. By adding telephony control to the desktop computer equipped with a
graphical user-interface, ease of use by all is assured.
The costs of ISDN
While ISDN gives users flexibility in the type of terminals that can be used
and the type of communications traffic that can be transmitted, the costs of
the service in terms of connection charges and rental costs will be critical
to widespread acceptance.
There will, for example, be a break-even calculation to be made to determine
whether the digital public switch network or private circuits would be
better for corporate users. A rough guide is that, if the lines between two
points are in constant use throughout the day, it makes sense to have a
dedicated link, because calls are free of charge.
However, if the links are only in operation part of the day, a fixed link is
an expensive option. BT makes a connection charge of Pounds 400 for ISDN2
(for 2 channels) with a quarterly rental charge of Pounds 84. ISDN30 is
charged at Pounds 152.75 connection and Pounds 32.12 per quarter per channel
(minimum 30), with extra charges for each facility required. Call charges
per channel are at the normal voice rate for inland calls and higher for
international data calls. A private link between, say, London and Aberdeen
would cost Pounds 8,692, including the Pounds 920 connection charge in the
first year; Pounds 7,772 for rental only in year two. To reach that cost
level using ISDN, you would need to make 121 standard rate (91 peak rate)
three-minute ISDN2 calls a day in the first year and 1,114 standard (86
peak) in year two. Assuming a 5-day week and a 52-week year, it would cost
Pounds 1,310 a year for 20 average 4-unit duration ISDN calls per day at
standard rate, Pounds 3,932 a year for 60 and Pounds 10,486 for 160 a day.
Mercury's offer
Many product suppliers have voiced their disappointment at BT's charges,
perhaps hoping that there would be concessions to kick-start take-up. By the
end of 1992, greater competition from Mercury may be the spur. While BT
offers either ISDN2 or ISDN30, Mercury is about to offer a lower entry point
for medium-sized business. Charges will be Pounds 1,380 for installation and
Pounds 1,710 annual rental, with each line thereafter costing Pounds 92 to
install and Pounds 114 annual rental.
When you get to 30 lines, the cost is Pounds 2,760 for installation (a
saving of Pounds 405 on the BT charge) and Pounds 3,420 per year rental (an
11 per cent annual saving).

FT  18 JUN 92 / Telecommunications In Business (24): New world of
communication for deaf people
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL WILTSHIRE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DEAF people who use text-phones now have a new world of communications
opened up for them with the introduction of 'Typetalk.' The telephone/text
service, developed jointly by the Royal National Institute for the Deaf and
BT, with Pounds 4m BT funding over three years, was launched this month.
Pictured above, left, is Tricia Parry, an operator who converts the spoken
word into writing in the Typetalk switchroom at Speke, near Liverpool.
Pictured right is Dr John Stuart, who - thanks to Typetalk - is now able to
carry out his work more quickly and efficiently. Dr Stuart, who is the
hazard information officer at Manchester University, reads incoming
conversation on the screen of his terminal, but uses the mouthpiece to speak
directly to the caller.
Typetalk calls are relayed to and from text-users through the UK to hearing
people worldwide. The new service is available round-the-clock as specially
trained operators relay text messages to hearing customers and return the
spoken reply by text.
In most cases, the cost of the call is no more than a hearing person would
pay by calling direct.
There is a rebate scheme, funded by BT and operated by Typetalk, entitling
users to claim back 60 per cent of the cost of non-business calls from one
phone line, up to a maximum of Pounds 160 per person a year.
More details on the service are available from Typetalk, at Pauline Ashley
House, Ravenside Retail Park, Speke Road, Liverpool, L24 8QB

FT  18 JUN 92 / Telecommunications In Business (25): Orders at the press of
a button - Trading data with business partners
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ADRIAN MORANT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EDI (electronic data interchange) systems, which rely on telecommunications,
can create information networks between retailers and manufacturers,
allowing both to align their operations more closely to sales patterns.
These networks replace laborious paperwork by transferring orders and
invoices between computers in the retailer's depot and those in their
supplier's warehouse - all at the press of a button.
Users of these systems range from high street food retailers to air-cargo
operators, as applications have developed rapidly over the past two years,
according to Ovum, a consultancy specialising in telecommunications market
and policy work.
In its latest EDI market forecasts for Europe, Ovum suggests that growth is
close to 45 per cent a year. Although the UK has led the way in EDI
applications, the rest of Europe is catching up fast.
Two years ago, Britain accounted for 60 per cent of European EDI-users. Now,
the proportion is down to 40 per cent.
This trend is expected to accelerate sharply with the wider European market
as companies, large and small, realise the benefits of using EDI technology.
The number of users in the UK was 12,000 in 1991 and is expected to reach
65,000 by 1995 according to both Ovum and BIS Strategic Decisions. The
latter further projects that the number of European users will have reached
110,000 by 1996.
Only about two per cent of European EDI traffic is international - both
within and outside of Europe - according to industry analysts.
Nevertheless, international traffic is likely to grow faster in Europe than
elsewhere due to the progress of European trade initiatives.
The EC's Trade Electronic Data Interchange systems programme, TEDIS
(launched in 1987) was instrumental during its three-year span to 1990 in
creating the infrastructure for the launch of the EDI concept in Europe.
The second phase, lasting until 1995, is supported by an EC budget of Ecu
25m and will consolidate the advances made in the fields of standardisation,
telecommunications, law, security and services in general.
Ovum, in conjunction with Belgium consultancy, XCOMS International, has been
awarded the TEDIS European EDI Inventory Project.
This will gather data from a number of organisations, both national and
international, currently engaged in EDI activities.
The information will be computerised and updated during the 3 1/2 years of
the TEDIS II programme.
The outcome should be be the most up-to-date and reliable source of EDI
information: this database is designed to become a standard reference point
for EDI developers, service providers, public bodies and private companies
throughout Europe.
Information from this project could well be of immense value to potential
users and thus boost EDI usage.
In the UK, INS and AT&amp;T Istel, dominate specific sectors - the former being
the key player in retail and distribution; the latter in manufacturing.
The INS 'EDI Community' has a membership of 3,252. Its list of members is
classified into 'trading clusters,' ie organisations using INS' EDI Services
to exchange commercial documents.
However, one of the problems in this apparently neat and tidy classification
is that many companies on the list actually use its services to trade
electronically with several trading clusters. Thus, INS recognises that
industry-by-industry vertical demarcations are breaking down even though
there is no universal inter-connectivity.
The challenge, according to Michael Naughton, chairman of Applied Network
Research, is 'the 80/20 rule of EDI - 80 per cent of your transactions are
with 20 per cent of your suppliers. But, what about the remaining 20 per
cent - do they stay manual?'
The trading partnership between MD Foods and Tesco is a good example of the
up-side of that rule. One of the world's top dairy producers - the Danish
company, MD Foods - was the first of Tesco's overseas suppliers to join the
growing EDI community by taking advantage of INS-Tradanet's international
facility.
It is owned by the 14,000 diary farmers who annually supply it with 70,000
tonnes of butter (its Lurpak butter accounts for nearly 20 per cent of the
UK market), as well as more than 200,000 tonnes of cheese.
Though electronic trading is not new to MD Foods, the company's marketing
systems manager Aksel Poulstrup points out: 'Electronic data interchange is
very important to us. Tesco is the first of our international customers to
trade electronically with us, but we're keen to extend the use of EDI to
other retailers in the UK and Europe.
'In doing so, we can capitalise on the substantial technical benefits that
we have already seen on a domestic scale.'
Even though it is relatively easy to extend its utility by adding additional
users and services, the down-side of the rule, is the cost of entry for
newcomers - especially in management time.
As Digital points out: 'The key to successful EDI implementation is careful
planning. Technology alone is not enough.
'EDI implementations require 80 per cent management focus and only 20 per
cent technology focus. Without the right approach, the process can be slow
and adversely effect your business efficiency.'
Thus, as with computers systems in the past, the blind adoption of
technology will not always guarantee the benefits needed to compete in the
marketplace.

FT  18 JUN 92 / Telecommunications In Business (22): Lost calls mean lost
business - In Brief
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL WILTSHIRE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A COMPANY with an average sales revenue of Pounds 25 per call, losing only
ten calls a day through operators being busy or absent, will have lost a
potential of Pounds 5,000 in a month and Pounds 60,000 by year-end.
The recognition by the business community of the importance of effective
call-management to their service performance - and hence their profitability
 -is reflected in the growth of the automatic call distribution (ACD)
marketplace.
Philips Business Systems, says that service-led companies - which now
account for 59 per cent of Britain's total Gross Domestic Product - face
potential revenue losses of millions of pounds a year because they answer
the phone inefficiently.
ACD systems reduce waiting times and spread the workload more evenly among
operators. Apart from giving call-traffic flexibility, they also generate
valuable management information for such service-led businesses as banks,
airlines, travel agencies, hotels, booking agents, mail order and credit
companies.
Mr Stewart Judd, senior policy adviser at the Confederation of British
Industry, says that as the UK's economy becomes increasingly meshed in the
information age, 'many businesses have become more dependent on the speed
and effectiveness with which they answer queries and provide quotations,
demonstrating that the organisation meets the highest standards of quality
and service.'
Research by Philips shows that a business handling more than 200 calls a day
would normally recover the cost of installing an ACD system within six
months while increasing the productivity of phone operators by around 30 per
cent.
The type of companies that benefit most from these systems are:
Where there is a group of people mainly taking incoming calls.
When customers want a service, not a person.
Where there is a need for performance indication.
When there is a need to balance the call-load.
Where incoming calls generate revenue.
Restructuring assignment in Bulgaria
TOUCHE ROSS, the UK management consultants, has been awarded an Pounds
880,000 contract to assist in the redevelopment of the telecommunications
market in Bulgaria, The project, part of the European Community's PHARE
programme to fund reconstruction in central and eastern Europe, will be
carried out in conjunction with the Danish Telephone Company.
Touche Ross will make a financial review of Bulgarian Post and Telephone
Company and project its performance over the next five years. Their findings
will be passed on to the European Investment Bank and the World Bank.
The consultants' tasks are also to assist the Bulgarian telecommunications
authority to set a new tariff structure and to put in place a new,
commercially-orientated financial management system to replace ageing and
inadequate practices, allowing the Bulgarian company to monitor its
performance in the new commercial environment.
Fax costs not well controlled
THIRTY-ONE per cent of respondents to a survey of FT Top 500 companies have
increased their usage of fax systems over the last year, despite the
recession. And 91 per cent believe that fax machines have helped to increase
their productivity.
Regular fax users among the FT Top 500 companies and the US Fortune 500
companies now send an average of 40 documents a day, with UK companies
receiving an average of 61 documents a day.
These are some of the main findings of a Gallup international survey of fax
usage, commissioned by Pitney Bowes, a leading independent supplier of fax
machines.
Fifty per cent of UK users have thermal fax machines: among respondents who
do not have a plain paper fax, 29 per cent wanted such a machine (53 per
cent in the US and 32 per cent in Canada). The survey also shows that costs
of faxing were not well-controlled - 'while fax usage has increased
considerably, operational costs are not being controlled,' says Meredith
Fischer of Pitney Bowes.
'Thermal paper, for example, is relatively expensive, tends to fade and has
to be copied if it needs to be kept. At about 1.7p per copy for paper and
toner, that can add more than Pounds 950 a year per machine.'
In the UK, 94 per cent of transmissions are made during normal business
hours, with 27 per cent likely to sent in the morning at peak charge rates -
despite features such as delayed transmission which enables non-urgent
documents to be sent at off-peak rates.
Frustration over 'faxlock'
FRUSTRATION arises in many offices when staff try to send fax messages to
busy fax machines - a problem sometimes known as 'faxlock' which can prove
expensive in terms of lost orders and business opportunities.
But with computer fax systems, the fax message does the queuing, not the
expensive office worker.
Ascom Telecommunications of Camberley, Surrey, have made a cost comparison
between sending faxes manually versus computer-faxing. Even assuming that
the machine is not busy with an out-going or incoming message, it can take
about 10 minutes to send a fax manually, once it has been prepared.
So, if the salary of the sender is Pounds 10 an hour, each fax can cost
Pounds 1.60 in manpower alone - and any business sending 25 faxes a day will
waste Pounds 40 a day or Pounds 10,000 a year.
Buying more fax machines is the easy palliative for 'faxlock,' but it does
not address the underlying problem, says Peter Champion of Ascom - 'the
answer is staggeringly simple: let the computer itself send the fax . . .
instead of printing it out on paper, and then having expensive people queue
up to feed it into the fax machine.'
Phone system for small businesses
A TELEPHONE system suitable for small offices and business has been launched
by BT - the '2+8' system, offering two lines and up to eight extensions was
trialled on a wide range of businesses such as doctors' practices, dental
surgeries, farms, dairies, print shops, leisure centres and homes for the
elderly.
While offering the benefits of a large 'start-of-the-art' switchboard, the
easy-to-use '2+8' is a fraction of the cost of larger systems - prices start
at Pounds 445, although a typical 2+8 system with lines, four extensions and
a 'systemphone' (which allows users to take advantage of advanced features)
costs Pounds 862, plus VAT.
Ann Brosnan, BT's voice products manager, says: 'The price of the 2+8 and
the fact that it can be used with ordinary telephones mean that a customer
can go from having no telephone at all to having the best on the market
without any significant investment.
'The aim is to give users real freedom as to how they set the system up  -
whether they want to buy, rent or lease.'
Features of the flexible system include universal line access (for fast
call-making and taking by any extension); operator control; a dedicated
line; intercom calls, using the systemphone; and hold/transfer/enquire
facilities.

FT  18 JUN 92 / Telecommunications In Business (19): Transatlantic link
offers big benefits - Video-conference network saves hundreds of man-hours
for Citibank
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL WILTSHIRE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CITIBANK'S European headquarters in London is to upgrade its international
video-conferencing facilities to provide pictures to near-broadcasting
quality.
Video links have now been established with the bank's offices in New York
and on the west coast of the US, as well as the Middle and Far East.
Frequently, as many as 12 Citibank staff in London take part in
transatlantic face-to-face video-conferences, with a similar number taking
part in New York. The bank saves an estimated 200 man-hours of travel time
by a single meeting of this kind.
Citibank, a subsidiary of Citicorp, one of the world's largest financial
institutions with assets of Dollars 230bn, has representation in 100
countries with 800 branches in Europe, alone.
Prior to the setting up of the video-conferencing network early last year,
senior officials at Citibank's London headquarters found it very difficult
to find time for essential meetings with colleagues in the bank's head
office in New York.
Howard Mills, head of graphics and audio-visual support services and George
Blake, voice and communications manager, were made jointly responsible for
setting up the video-conferencing facility when the decision to install the
system was made during the Gulf War crisis. A video-conferencing network was
already operated by Citicorp in the US, but the threat of terrorist activity
during the Gulf crisis meant that Citicorp executives - like those of many
other US corporations - were grounded.
Mills and Clarke were given the task of setting up the video operation in
London as quickly as possible; the contract for the work was given to
Internet Technology of Bristol.
Internet also supplies video-conferencing solutions throughout Canada, via
its subsidiary, Internet Technologie, based in Montreal.
The company is also UK distributor for Compression Labs, a leading supplier
of video codecs, the devices used to compress and digitize video and audio
signals for transmission over standard digital telecommunication circuits -
a technique that dramatically reduces transmission costs.
The new network won immediate acceptance by London executives and has since
proved 'a very viable alternative to expensive and time-consuming
transatlantic travel,' say users.
Citicorp's chairman in New York has used the link to address groups in
London. And recently a cable run from the studio to a video projector in the
Strand office's restaurant enabled a gathering of 150 Citibank staff in
London to exchange views with the head of the corporation.
The London studio can set up a video link with only about an hour's notice.
The facility, which is used for about 70 hours a month, will probably
attract even more users after the upgrading project is completed.

FT  18 JUN 92 / Telecommunications In Business (18): A demand for more
user-friendly systems - Smart Phones / Telephones are starting to seem very
old-fashioned compared to personal computers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE BLACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHILE PCs have progressed rapidly with graphical user interfaces, telephones
have remained distinctly unfriendly.
Today's feature phones are not much more advanced than conventional phones.
As far as most people are concerned, the last great leap forward was the
replacement of the circular dial by push-buttons.
Most private automatic branch exchanges (PABXs) support a number of
telephone features intended to make the user's life easier, especially if he
or she is a senior manager under pressure.
These include liquid crystal displays giving details of incoming and
outgoing calls and dedicated function and programmable keys which can store
numbers for access by pressing a single' key. More numbers can be stored in
the exchange and accessed by short codes.
If an internal number is engaged, the exchange can be automatically
instructed to call back when free.
Conference calls can be set up and a built-in microphone can leave both
hands free during calls. Secretaries can keep track of a group of lines to
see which are engaged and alert a manager to another incoming call.
But most such features are little used. According to Mr Paul Turton, a
senior associate at technology consultancy CSC Index, over 90 per cent of
them are never used and less than 10 per cent of people use any of them
regularly,
On internal training courses it often emerges that many people cannot even
perform simple operations such as call transfer, pick-up, retrieval and
diversion.
Financial directors are reluctant to spend money on more complex equipment
which staff are even less likely to use.
Prices for feature phones are still high.
The simplest analogue feature phones with a few basic functions cost Pounds
30-Pounds 50, compared to around Pounds 10 for the most basic telephone on
the market.
Digital feature phones are in the range of Pounds 200-Pounds 300, so they
will not be spread around unless there is a good reason.
The problem is partly one of training. Senior staff who could most benefit
from knowing how to use their telephones fully are the most reluctant to go
on training courses. But the main reason is that the machines are still too
hard to use. Manufacturers have crammed in too many features without
adequate instructions and users are not surprisingly confused.
Ms Susan Dark, group product manager for Mercury Communications, thinks that
many more types of telecommunications services will be used once the
telephones themselves become more user-friendly.
'Telephones need to become much more like personal computers,' she contends.
They are about to do so. The next generation of smart phones may reach the
European market next year.
These devices with built-in microprocessors and much improved displays are
now being tested by a number of manufacturers around the world.
ONE of the most important trials is to be conducted in the US by AT&amp;T later
this year with Huntington National Bank, a regional bank based at Columbus,
Ohio.
The service is aimed mainly at home banking and home shopping applications.
AT&amp;T envisages that the services on which users will be most keen will
include transferring cash between accounts, reviewing their cheque payments,
paying bills and checking investment rates.
The prototype of AT&amp;T's smart phone - the name is generic and attempts to
trademark it have been blocked - has an angled touch-screen measuring 6 ins.
by 4 ins. and plugs into the telephone line through a transformer to provide
the power to light up the screen.
Its internal memory maintains programs for a year, in the event of a power
cut. Inside, the smart phone is said to look almost exactly like a PC. The
touch-screen displays columns of autodial button images which form a
menu-driven system similar to that of a PC.
For instance, an autodial button might call up a range of pre-set services,
ask the user to choose one and then automatically call that number. The
touch-screen can also be configured as a keyboard in several formats for
entering data.
The smart phone will also offer the range of facilities that are provided by
today's feature phones in a more accessible format. It will be able to store
over 200 telephone numbers.
AT&amp;T's version has a built-in modem which allows the phone to communicate
via a service platform of hardware and software with the computers of a
bank, travel agency or other service provider.
A key element is the protocol for communication between the smart phone and
the service platform. AT&amp;T says it is considering placing its protocol in
the public domain to encourage the development of the market.
Mr Mike Grisham, AT&amp;T's strategic planning manager at Bell Laboratories in
New Jersey, has been leading the company's smart phone project since the
early 1980s.
He believes that AT&amp;T will be first to market with the new machines, but
others will not be far behind.
The manufacturers say it is hard to predict when the smart phone will become
a mass market. The key to creating that market appears to be agreements
between the manufacturers and potential service providers. AT&amp;T is at
present in talks with some such companies in the US, Europe and Asia and
plans to launch experiments in Europe in 1993.
European manufacturers such as Philips and Alcatel are expected to join the
market soon after. Their machines may well have very different designs. Far
Eastern manufacturers are expected to follow and help to bring down prices,
which will be crucial.

FT  18 JUN 92 / Telecommunications In Business (21): Stockbrokers find
better way to update clients
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL WILTSHIRE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN today's competitive financial market, NCB Group, the Dublin-based
stockbrokers - along with similar institutions - is exercising tighter
cost-controls across its operating divisions, writes Michael Wiltshire.
In common with many financial houses, NCB regularly sends information and
newsletters to its clients which include a wide range of Irish multinational
companies, private businesses and substantial private investors.
NCB is one of the first financial institutions to apply the advanced
technology of AT&amp;T's 'EasyLink' services. Every Friday, two newsletters
bringing clients up-to-date with key developments are sent to hundreds of
companies in the UK, Europe and the US - one deals with equity business and
the other with Irish and international bond markets.
A typical newsletter would run to about three pages with commentary, prices
changes and other data.
Before the introduction of Enhanced Fax to the operation, just over a year
ago, NCB used a fax card in a PC to communicate the weekly update to its
clients. Although adequate, NCB found its original system time-consuming and
costly. As Noel Doyle, the telecommunications manager at NCB, points out:
'Using a fax card in a PC was a feasible way of communicating with a small
to medium-sized client-base, but as we grew and numbers increased, this
method became cumbersome.'
NCB has found that the application of AT&amp;T's Enhanced-Fax has brought
cost-savings and cut administration time. The company simply keys in the
list of its customers into a 'mailbox' node at EasyLink, where it is stored.
Since the list is held at EasyLink and not in the PC, time spent on the line
sending the fax, is reduced considerably.
The Enhanced-Fax 'broadcast' facility uses AT&amp;T's dedicated international
fibre-optic network. The digitised transmission has an automatic
error-correcting protocol which ensures a higher-than-normal quality of
transmission.
NCB staff no longer have to undertake a laborious Monday morning routine of
manually scanning for transmissions that failed to be sent, if, for example,
the receiving fax terminal was not in operation.
With E-fax, the days of cross-checking more than 200 fax deliveries are
over, since a fully comprehensive report is issued to NCB indicating any
faxes that remain undelivered.

FT  18 JUN 92 / Telecommunications In Business (17): Prices of machines
continue to tumble - Colour fax systems on the way
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN little more than a decade, facsimile machines have become an integral
part of most offices and a vital communications tool. Now they are appearing
in homes, cars and even brief cases.
Fax machines are also becoming faster and more sophisticated; and they are
being integrated with other office equipment such as laser printers and
desktop PCs, and new value-added communications services are being built
around them.
Equipment sales grew rapidly in the 1980s and, in spite of the recession,
they have been buoyed more recently by the advent of plain paper fax
machines and the emerging consumer market, targeted by the mainly Japanese
hardware manufacturers.
As prices continue to tumble, some analysts believe that by the mid-1990s,
one in three fax machines sold will be for personal use. Many of these
small, desktop machines combine the functions of telephone, answering
machine, photocopier and facsimile and can switch between voice and fax and
need only a single line.
Today, there are an estimated 15-20m fax machines worldwide, a number which
is expected to grow to over 30m by the end of 1993. Most are of the Group 3
industry standard and can send an A4 sheet across the world in seconds for
the price of a telephone call.
The biggest installed base is in the US, but according to the British
Facsimile Industry Consultative Committee, which represents suppliers, there
are more than 900,000 machines in the UK and two out of every three
employees have access to a fax terminal.
Fax-usage is also increasing. The UK market will be worth about Pounds 750m
this year and is growing by about 30 per cent a year compared to five per
cent for voice traffic.
One reason for this rapid growth is that fax machines are relatively simple
to operate. Nevertheless, there is a trend towards more sophisticated
machines and features like number memories, one-touch and speed dialling,
automatic paper-cutter and activity reports are increasingly regarded as
standard, even on basic machines.
Some machines can now store a fax for transmission later, others remember
messages when they have run out of paper, can be operated remotely, or have
the ability to 'broadcast' a fax to multiple destinations.
A new machine from Yamaha can read a file from a PC floppy disk and then
send it as a fax while others can read, send and store faxes from optical
disks.
Meanwhile, Sony will this month begin to market a 1.5kg battery operated
portable fax in Japan which can be connected to a cellular,car or a pay
phone, send an A4 sheet in 20 seconds and display incoming faxes on an LCD
screen.
Colour fax machines are also just around the corner. Several Japanese
manufacturers have announced colour machines although Sharp is the only
manufacturer to unveil a Group 3 desktop colour machine which will work on a
standard telephone line.
The Sharp FO9000, which will be available shortly in the UK, can transmit an
A4 colour photograph in three minutes and print from a palette of 255
colours using a high quality dye-sublimation print engine.
Colour machines are expected to meet a specialist need, rather than replace
mono faxes, but plain paper faxes are gradually replacing the traditional
thermal machine, with its rolls of expensive paper which crumple easily and
eventually fade.
Although they are generally more expensive than thermal machines, the price
difference is narrowing and plain paper, like used in photocopiers and laser
printers, is cheaper.
Indeed, the distinctions between fax machines and other office equipment are
becoming blurred. For example, Xerox and other manufacturers have recently
launched plain paper fax machines that double as photocopiers and Fujitsu's
Faxjet turns a LaserJet compatible printer into a fax receiver.
Plug-in cards and external fax-modems are already providing portable
computers, desktop PCs and networked PCs with the power to send and receive
faxes.
There is also growing demand for faster fax transmission to cut labour, time
and phone costs. Some Group 3 machines already operate at 14,400 bits per
second (14.4k bps) over the public switched telephone network and can
receive or send an A4 page in about six seconds. There are also a few Group
4 faxes which were designed to operate on ISDN (integrated services digital
network) circuits at 64k bps, transmitting an A4 page in 3-4 seconds.
But although Group 4 faxes have been around since the mid-1980s the
introduction of ISDN has been much slower than expected.
In the meantime, the transmission speed of Group 3 machines has been further
enhanced and an alternative 64k bps standard has emerged called either Group
3bis or G364.
While its advocates are not suggesting that Group 3bis machines will be much
cheaper than Group 4, they do argue that the Group 3bis approach will make
it easier for faxes to work on both the ISDN and the public switched
telephone network while offering the same speed,resolution and other
improvements as Group 4 faxes.
In another important area, that of error-free transmission,an industry
standard was adopted in 1988. Machines complying with the standard
automatically resend corrupted sections of a message, ensuring that users
can be confident that a document will reach its destination ungarbled.
Meanwhile, some telecommunications groups have seized the opportunity to
generate additional income by offering value-added services to fax
customers.
For example in the UK, BT offers its voice-prompted FeatureFax service while
in the US American Telephone and Telegraph offers a similar subscription
service called EnhancedFAX which enables customers to broadcast a fax,
virtually simultaneously, to as many as 10,000 fax machines via nodes in the
US, Canada, the UK, Japan and Hong Kong.
The service came to prominence during the Gulf war, when more than 1m
messages were sent to troops in 'Operation Desert Fax.'
In the UK, Vodafone's Vodata unit began offering an adjunct to its audiotex
service a year ago called Vodastream Fax service. This facsimile-based
information delivery system can either be used by people to call in by fax
to a central number and receive back a fax from the information provider, or
by the provider to send multiple fax copies to a list of recipients.
The service is currently used by, among others, the Met Office for weather
information for pilots and yachtsmen and by the Central statistical Office
to distribute government information.
The Vodastream service also has a fax mailbox facility where messages can be
left and recalled later by the intended recipient using a fax machine from
anywhere in the world.
Mercury's managed fax service in the UK, called Surefax, is a particularly
sophisticated set of value-added services aimed at multinational customers
and launched by the Cable and Wireless group subsidiary in October.
Mr Paul David, business development manager in Mercury's messaging division,
says it was designed to provide cost effective solutions to many of the
problems business customers complain about like busy and dropped fax lines,
costly redials and paying unnecessary premium rates to send non-urgent faxes
during peak periods.
Mercury claims its Surefax switch is the largest in the world with a
capacity to handle over 18,000 fax pages an hour. Eight months after its
launch it is already handling about 3,000 fax messages a day, with an
average length of 3.3 pages.
Documents can be sent to the Surefax switch - a kind of automated fax
exchange - from an ordinary fax machine via a special socket, or direct from
a desktop PC, for passing onto single or multiple recipients either
immediately, or sometime later.
Among its other features, Surefax ensures 'a never-busy fax line' and will
auto matically retry a recipient's line until the fax is sent. If
transmission is lost or garbled, it will resend only those pages that are
missing.
One significant growth area targeted by the Surefax service is PC-generated
faxes. It is estimated that in the UK about 80 per cent of all faxes begin
life as a wordprocessor file on a PC. But the document is usually printed
out before being loaded into a fax machine for delivery.
Only two per cent of fax traffic is sent directly from PCs, but Mr Daniel
says 'we are convinced this is going to change.'
Eventually, he expects up to a quarter of all faxes to be sent directly from
a PC or from a computer network.

FT  18 JUN 92 / Telecommunications In Business (15): Europe within calling
distance - Mobile Telephony
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN THE 1980s, mobile telephony was one of the most dynamic service sectors
recording explosive growth in the UK and worldwide. But recently its growth
has slowed - just as a new generation of digital mobile telephone systems
are launched.
In Britain, so many customers bought mobile phones in the late 1980s that
the two cellular telephone network operators, Cellnet and Vodafone, had to
increase capacity to keep pace with the volume of calls. Helped by steady
call charges and declining equipment prices Britain has ended up with more
than twice as many cellular telephone users as Germany, France or Italy.
But after several years of spectacular growth, the UK subscriber base -
which is dominated by business customers and small businesses in particular
 -grew by just 7 per cent last year to 1.23m, and both UK operators now have
excess capacity.
This slowdown has come at a critical time for the industry which, as Mr
Chris Gent, managing director of Vodafone says, 'is very fast moving and
changing.' The cellular system in the UK, in operation since 1985, uses
analogue technology, but in future two new digital systems will be also
competing for customers in the mobile communications market:
The first, called Telepoint, is an economy-style mobile system designed for
travelling business customers, but its main drawback is that subscribers
cannot receive incoming calls.
A second set of new services, which can also receive incoming calls, are
based upon GSM (Groupe Speciale Mobile), a pan-European digital mobile
communications standard.
However, these new technologies have got off to a shaky start in the UK.
Three of the original four consortia licensed by the government to offer
Telepoint services pulled out after sustaining significant losses and ending
up with only 5,000 customers between them. Despite this the fourth,
Hutchison Telecom, went ahead with the launch of its telepoint service, and
a satellite-based paging service, in April.
On a Europe-wide basis, however, most interest is focused on GSM which is
viewed as the most important advance since the development of cellular
phones. It is also changing the way existing European networks operate
because many countries are using it to introduce competition for
nationalised monopolies.
When they are operational the GSM services will make it possible to drive
from one end of Europe to the other using the same cellular mobile
telephone. Seventeen countries agreed to the GSM standard and set a target
of July last year for the launch of a limited initial service.
Problems with the technology and other problems have resulted in some
delays. However, several operators, including both Cellnet and Vodafone in
the UK, have already successfully tested GSM systems. Mr Gent of Vodafone
says the setting of original target was always 'a bit tongue-in-cheek,' but
has, nevertheless, provided an important initial impetus.
Indeed, the first of a new range of GSM telephones manufactured by Orbitel
Mobile Communications, the Vodafone/Ericsson joint venture equipment
manufacturer, received UK approval at the end of last month, ensuring that
the first equipment for use on the new systems will be available to
customers later this year.
Once operational mobile phone users will be able to make and receive calls
on any GSM phone in any country covered by the system. Subscribers' details
will be recorded on a smart card which will plug into a slot in a GSM phone.
Having plugged in the user card the phone will adopt the user's number, and
all calls will be billed to the card owner.
Because the system is digital, it should provide secure high quality voice
and data transmission and enable system operators to offer additional
features such as call hold, call transfer and messaging services.
The GSM systems in France, Germany, Scandinavia and the Benelux countries
should become operational later this year, and Vodafone which launched its
network in December, says it plans to have 90 per cent of its system in
place by the middle of 1993. Cellnet, which is owned by BT and Securicor,
has been also testing its GSM network and is planning to launch the service
commercially next year.
But, in spite of its imminent availability, it is unlikely GSM services will
replace the older analogue systems, at least not in the short term. GSM
phones will initially be more expensive than existing analogue cellphones
and will also be much bigger, and heavier. Many mobile phone users are
expected to remain on the analogue system and Mr Gent believes there will be
a slow migration to GSM.
However, the GSM system operators, who are investing very heavily in digital
infrastructure, are hoping for a quicker take-up of the other mass market
digital services which they will also be able to provide. For example,
Vodafone plans to launch a second service on the back of GSM called the
Micro-Cellular Network, or MCN, which will be a low-cost urban-based
portable telephone service aimed at domestic customers and is due to be
launched in the south east of England in mid 1993.
MCN call charges are expected to be cheap, from only 10 pence a minute
within a user's home town, to 20 pence a minute for national calls putting
the service in direct competition with fixed telephone networks. MCN
subscribers who travel will also be able to access the nationwide and
pan-European GSM service, but at premium rates.
Mr Gent belives MCN and similar services will make mobile telephony
available to many more people. He admits that MCN is being launched in part
as a response to the competition for the domestic market expected from other
new digital systems called Personal Communications Networks.
In 1989, when the UK government asked companies to apply for PCN licences,
companies rushed to compete, buoyed by predictions of 10m customers by the
end of the decade, and the belief subscribers would swap their ordinary
phones for PCN's pocket-sized personal handsets.
But since then the UK economy has plunged into deep recession and the need
for heavy investment has frightened many of the original
shareholders,leading to delays in starting the new services. Two of the
original three consortiums awarded PCN licences, Mercury Personal
Communications and Unitel, recently agreed to merge, while the third,
Microtel, was sold to Hutchison Telecom.
PCNs will use pocket-sized high frequency radio phones over short distances
to link users to traditional telephone exchanges via a system of relay
stations. Their proponents argue that PCN has a number of advantages over
GSM, including smaller phones, and a greater network capacity because cells
are smaller, and so the same frequency spectrum can carry a greater volume
of calls.
These new digital services, together with the advanced satellite paging
systems, promise a second revolution in business mobile telecommunications.
But although GSM will be a European-wide system, the dream of being able to
use a phone anywhere in the world is still some way off.
Although Australia, New Zealand, and some Middle Eastern and African
countries have shown interest in GSM, Japan and the US have chosen different
standards. A truly worldwide mobile telephone system may have to wait for a
third generation of systems, the long-awaited universal mobile telephone
system, or UMTS, which could be introduced by 2000.

FT  18 JUN 92 / Telecommunications In Business (13): Now the technology
comes of age - Audio-Conferencing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIE HARNETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE MAY be many new and exciting technologies for business communications,
but the telephone is coming back into its own in the electronic office, as
the medium for time-critical conferencing applications.
Swanning around the country, or hopping on Concorde just to attend a
half-hour briefing meeting, could be a thing of the past. Audio-conferencing
has been available for many years, of course, but 1992 marks a turning point
in terms of the technology, according to Steve Gandy, manager marketing &amp;
sales, BT Visual &amp; Broadcast Services.
'In fact, things have started changing quite radically. The key change has
been the introduction of low-cost audioconferencing equipment which is
purpose built for the conferencing environment, enabling a number of people
to participate, no matter where they are located.
'More importantly, the new generation of systems feature full-duplex
operation and the latest echo cancelling technology, which means that every-
one in the room, and people in remote locations, can all speak at the same
time and be heard by each other as if they were all in the same room, with
no clipped sentences or lost meanings,' he says.
The market: according to researchers, Frost &amp; Sullivan, the US market for
audioconferencing in 1990 was worth
Dollars 726.6, of which Dollars 87.8m was equipment sales, Dollars 180m
value-added services revenues and Dollars 458.8m transmission revenues. A
five-fold jump is forecast over five years, which suggests it will represent
a Dollars 3.54bn market by 1995. Since it is estimated by other sources that
North America accounts for 82 per cent, and Europe for 12 per
cent of the worldwide market, audio-conferencing was worth around Dollars
880m in 1990 and will rise to Dollars 4bn in 1995, with network operators,
service providers and equipment manufacturers all able to look forward to a
slice of the action. Indeed, BT says that the audioconferencing in the
office-to-office business communications sector alone will be worth Dollars
49m in Europe by 1995.
The applications and benefits: audio-conferencing is set to become one of
the most important communications tools for the 1990s, helping people to run
their businesses more effectively and save costs - not just the upfront
expenses of air fares and hotel accommodation, but the below-line costs
associated with the time, inconvenience and effort spent gathering people
together in a single location and taking them away from their core activity.
Face-to-face meetings will not, of course, become, a thing of the past but
the physical presence of participants will not always be necessary. In fact,
it will be possible for people to hold meetings more often, without
adversely effecting the time spent on their core activities.
The improvements in the decision-making process could be dramatic. Using
their own equipment, or the service of a bureau, businessmen can set up
telephone meetings in whatever combination they like. It could be half a
dozen executives, each in their own offices but linked together; it could be
two groups, one in the London boardroom and the other in the New York
office, or it could be one person, linked to many different individuals
spread around the country.
Another application might be telephone broadcasting, using the telephone
system like a radio transmitter to send a message to the whole workforce
simultaneously. The broadcast can be turned into a phone-in programme,
allowing key regional managers to quiz the boss on an important policy
issue.
Users: audio-conferencing is being used for crisis management in commercial
operations. The AA and RAC are big users for control of traffic and general
operations. It is also used in the professions, such as law and management
consultancy, where time is money and fee-earners must be seen to be offering
a cost-effective service.
BT says that 25 per cent of its user base is in the financial sector, where
audioconferencing is used for the early morning 'prayer meeting,' as well as
for time-critical meetings, where, for example, dealers need to discuss how
to react to a financial crisis before the news breaks.
A large proportion - around 30 per cent of users - is in sales and
marketing, where audio-conferencing is used for weekly briefings and sales
update meetings.
'The alternative is for the manager to ring each sales person individually
or take everyone off the road to gather in one location, reducing their
selling time. The cost, time and effort involved normally means it just
doesn't happen", says Mr Gandy.
But what about the all-important psychology factor where face-to-face
meetings enable those participating to determine what mood someone is in, or
what their attitude is by interpreting body language?
'That is where the new technology plays an important part. Providing you
know the person, you can tell their reaction by detecting the nuances in the
tone of someone's voice,' Mr Gandy suggests.
The technology: though there are a number of audioconferencing equipment
manufacturers, UK-based GPT Telecom being one of them, most tend to focus
their marketing effort on the seemingly more glamorous videoconference
market. However, those manufacturers whose products are marketed by BT are
likely to be the market leaders, not least because BT claims 80 per cent of
the Pounds 5.4m UK audio-conferencing market.
As well as offering a Conference Call bureau service, BT has four products
in its portfolio, with prices starting at Pounds 680, and moving up the
range in terms of sound level quality, duplex operation, and the number of
people that can comfortably participate in a conference.
The low-cost entry unit for desk-to-desk audioconferencing is the AC2000
which is manufactured in the UK by Cairntek. For desktop or small roundtable
conferences, the AC4000, manufactured by NEC of Japan and sold by them as
the Voicepoint, is priced at Pounds 1,200, the price premium being accounted
for by the marginally better sound level quality and duplex operation.
For bigger rooms, BT offers the ST3000 and ST6000 both of which are
manufactured by US-based Shure - 'the reason we offer a choice is so that
customers can be provided with a system that is fit for the purpose in a
particular environment,' says Mr Gandy.
The other important element in the new generation of technology is the
bridge which connects the telephone lines for multiple-location
audio-conferencing. Bridges are modular in concept, starting with a
five-line bridge costing Pounds 3,000 that can connect five locations into
the conference.
There is no theoretical top limit to the number of bridges that can be
provided. The limit comes with meeting dynamics. BT tends to find that the
optimum size using their computer controlled bridge, the PC Elite is 40
lines. As to operating costs, through the bureau service the average
audio-conference call charge is between Pounds 25 for local area
point-to-point call and Pounds 85 for an international call. Obviously,
calls from user premises will be at the normal telephone rate.
According to Malcolm Bartlett of NEC (UK) Telecoms Division, the cost of the
equipment could be covered if just two executives can avoid having to cross
the
Developments in audio-conferencing as a business communications technology
are continuing apace. Enhanced facilities will enable an operator to take
control of conferences, bringing people into a meeting and taking
individuals out as the conference progresses; send faxes to each participant
simultaneously; and use the keypad to access a bureau service, as and when
required.
The availability of ISDN (the integrated service digital network) adds
further dimensions to desktop-to-desktop audioconferencing. Among the
benefits will be stereo-quality sound, since ISDN provides a 7Khz frequency
range compared with the 3-4Khz maximum offered by public switched telephone
network (PSTN), with no crackles on the line to drown out speech.
Also, it will be possible to have audio with simultaneous multimedia
transmissions, using one of the two 64K channels on the ISDN line for voice
and the other for fax or data transmissions.

FT  18 JUN 92 / Telecommunications In Business (12): How to make the right
connections - Answering machines and voice-messaging systems become more
sophisticated
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RESEARCH studies have shown that up to 75 per cent of all telephone calls
initially fail to find the right person. One solution to this problem is to
install an answering machine or other voice-messaging technology.
The answering machine is a simple and effective means for passing on
information to an individual or a small group of people if they are
unavailable at the time of a call.
The latest models boast sophisticated refinements which, for example, allow
owners to access the machine remotely then, by tapping out a code on the
telephone keypad, go straight to the stored messages.
Other features on new machines like the Panasonic KX-T1456, which costs less
than Pounds 85 and is designed for private or small business use, include a
message memo facility which enables messages to be left by family or a
secretary while the user is away.
Most mobile telephone-users now have access to messaging services. For
example, in the UK, Cellnet launched its 24-hour answering services for
cellphone customers last autumn. The system called Callback, will record all
calls automatically and then call the mobile phone user to transmit the
messages.
To use the service, the Cellnet customer simply taps in a short divert code
and from then on all unanswered calls are automatically handled by Callback.
The competing Vodafone mobile phone system launched a similar service called
Recall last month. Once connected to the service, all calls are answered,
even if the customer's mobile phone is switched off, and they are then
alerted by a call when they switch back on. The Recall service also offers a
number of other features including a simple help menu for example to repeat
or skip messages, security code message protection, a choice of greeting
message for callers.
More generally, voice and call processing technology enables a standard
telephone to function as a computer terminal by allowing the user to access
computer applications using voice commands, the telephone keypad or a
combination of the two.
The European market for voice and call processing systems is projected to
grow from Pounds 100m last year to Pounds 850m in 1995 and is being targeted
by companies like Hampshire-based Advanced System Architectures which has
launched a range of voice and call processing systems and products offered
as 'productivity boosters' to businesses and to software houses and systems
integrators.
Using the technology, voice mail and voice-messaging systems, which
represent a kind of corporate answering machine where messages are recorded
to be picked up by the recipient dialling a personal mailbox number, were
pioneered in the US by companies like Octel, AT and T, VMX, Northern Telecom
and Centigram.
Although used widely in the US, companies in Europe have only recently begun
using voice messaging technology and implementation of systems in the UK is
running about three years behind the US.
However, the UK is generally ahead of the rest of Europe, probably because
it was the first country in Europe to liberalise the provision of phone
services and equipment.
As a result the number of touch-tone telephones is quite large in the UK,
and that is a pre-requisite for voice messaging unless people carry
touch-pads around in their pockets the whole time.
Many large companies first begin to use voice-messaging services through a
telephone company bureau. This enables them to become familiar with the
technology by using a small number of voice mail boxes.
Once they appreciate the advantages, many install their own equipment which
can then handle more complicated processing tasks like combining voice
messaging with electronic mail and faxes.
By providing a link between the company computer system and the in-house
voice-processing system, electronic mail - usually sent from one computer
user to another - can be stored digitally in the recipient's mailbox.
A caller interrogating the messaging system will then be told that there
are, say, two voice and one electronic mail messages. The caller can then
listen to the voice mail messages and, if required, the electronic mail can
also be 'read' to the caller by a digitised computer voice.
Some systems can even go further, storing facsimile messages which can then
be forwarded to a fax machine near the caller.
While technologies such as voice mail enables callers to leave, retrieve or
exchange digitally recorded voice-messages, audiotex enables callers to
access a wide variety of pre-recorded information, for example aircraft
flight times.
Most recently, interactive voice response products have emerged which allow
callers to input information to, and retrieve information and services from
a company computer database using a touch-tone telephone.
These different voice processing technologies are gradually merging together
and becoming increasingly sophisticated with the use of voice recognition,
voice synthesis and image processing to handle more complex transactions.
One example of this was un veiled earlier this year by Syntellect, an
Arizona-based company which launched what it claims is the first
multilingual interactive voice response system.
Syntellect's new Global-Series of Interactive Voice response (IVR) systems
was designed to enable callers from anywhere in the world to call at any
time of day or night and to and leave or receive a message, place an order,
obtain a quote or get an answer a technical query.
Using sophisticated voice synthesis and processing techniques the system
'understands' six different languages at first contact level. Once onto the
system the caller can then communicate in any of 26 languages.
The IVR system can be connected to almost any sort of host computer system
allowing the caller to access his target's database, either to input
information or to retrieve information and services.
It also allows the caller to leave, retrieve or exchange digitally recorded
messages or access pre-recorded information using audiotex. The system is
aimed at organisations like banks and other financial services companies,
transport companies, governments and company sales and customer service
departments.
Using systems like this it is claimed that costs can be reduced because
there is less need for human telephone switchboard operators and customers
benefit from improved 24-hours service. Like their less-sophisticated
counterparts, they may also help increase the proportion of calls and
messages that do eventually find their way to the intended recipient.

FT  18 JUN 92 / Telecommunications In Business (14): Boost for efficiency -
Teleworking/Telecommuting
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ADRIAN MORANT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WITH plenty of empty office space in many of the world's cities, the growing
interest in teleworking - or working from home - may be bad news for
hard-hit commercial property markets.
A rather formal definition of teleworking (sometimes known as telecommuting)
from BT is: 'Any time when an employee, instead of travelling to a central
office, stays at home or at a remote site and uses a telephone line to send
and receive work.'
Though you may not have known it, you have probably teleworked at some time
or another - just recall those days when you have worked at home, making
extensive use of the phone, perhaps due to a transport strike or because of
sickness. Furthermore, many business activities involve work at home.
In the UK, more than 500,000 people are thought to telework full-time, with
a further 1.5m part-time. Some analysts estimate that by the year 2010, at
least 20 per cent of non-manual working in the UK will be working from home,
or near it.
Teleworking's basic enabling technology is, of course, the telephone, but as
well as allowing remote voice-communication, the phone line can be used for
fax machines and modems which respectively enable images and data to be sent
speedily from one place to another.
Here, office memos and correspondence can be prepared on the ubiquitous PC
and transported by electronic mail services such as Telecom Gold, Mercury
Link 7500 and MCI Mail. These facilities can also be supported in all but
the most remote places by means of cellular phones.
While developments such as ISDN, Centrex, broadband and intelligent networks
will smooth the path to teleworking, the digitalisation of the basic
telephone network is arguably the most important factor.
Many conventional office activities are suitable for teleworking:
specialists, whose work frequently has a high 'independent' content;
managers, who need intervals of peace and quiet so that they can concentrate
on specific tasks; 'nomads,' such as salesmen or area managers, who often
have a roving commission; and clerical staff who may perform data-entry work
or telesales from home.
In the UK, interest is being shown in a network of 'telecottages' - or work
centres in country areas in Devon and the Scottish Highlands where local
people call in for faxes, electronic mail and other data.
SINCE an underlying feature of teleworking is the use of telecommunications,
it is hardly surprising that both Mercury and BT are actively promoting it.
Last October, when Mercury produced its Teleworker Portfolio, it published
research carried out by Gallup that showed that it is a popular and highly
effective option for both the individual and for the employer.
They found that of companies operating a teleworking scheme, 97 per cent
consider the practice to be effective, giving increased efficiency, (42 per
cent); increased productivity, (40 per cent); and cost-savings, (38 per
cent) as the most important reasons for teleworking.
However, as well as these benefits that are easily quantified and
transferred to the balance sheet, there are other issues which need to be
addressed. To quote from a BT Research Laboratories report, An Overview of
Teleworking: '. . . over the last decade there has been a movement of
population from cities leading to an increasing population in urban and
rural areas. For many families, their chosen environment would be a country
village. Teleworking will help this aspiration to be fulfilled.'
Teleworking will be one way of combatting the projected shortages of skilled
staff, as it will enable companies to retain staff who would otherwise
leave.
Since last October, Chris Ridgewell, Mercury's product manager for
teleworking, has conducted more than 70 teleworking workshops for groups of
up to 200 people.
These meetings have often been followed by presentations to companies which
have then have set up working parties of staff, executives and trade unions,
as they consider moving towards setting up teleworking schemes.
Despite the benefits to both employer and employee, care is needed in the
introduction of teleworking, if problems are to be avoided. As well as the
fear of apparent 'loss of status' by the teleworker as compared to on-site
staff, there are other factors such as the risk of social isolation and
loneliness; also, the maintenance of company confidentiality, and the
provision and insurance of teleworking equipment.
Britain is arguably far in advance of the rest of Europe in all aspects of
teleworking. Thus, the European Community has shown interest in the proposed
code of practice for teleworking by the UK's National Teleworking Advisory
Council. It has, as its overriding aim, the encouragement of growth in the
teleworking sector; in particular, by responding to the commercial
requirements of large companies.
Such businesses need appropriate terms of reference to cope with this change
in working environments if teleworking is to grow to its full potential in
the UK and elsewhere.

FT  18 JUN 92 / Telecommunications In Business (8): An alternative to
costly, tiring travel - Video-Conferencing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
VIDEO-CONFERENCING is a technology and business communications medium whose
time may finally have arrived. Equipment prices are falling, simple-to-use
desktop and PC-card systems are appearing and for the first time
video-conferencing and video-telephony are beginning to offer a real
alternative to costly, inconvenient and tiring travel.
According to the US-based Gartner Group the world market for
video-conferencing equipment is now worth about Dollars 200m and is doubling
each year. Dial-up, high performance systems are the fastest growing sector
accounting for about 70 per cent of the total market and are forecast to
account for about 98 per cent of the market by 1995.
The big three video-conferencing system manufacturers are PictureTel, which
has about 75 per cent of the US market for dial-up video-conferencing at
data rates of under 384 kilobits per second (Kbps), GEC Plessey
Telecommunications of the UK, and California-based Compression Labs which
produce high-end systems with data rates of above 384Kbps. Indicating the
market's dynamism, PictureTel's turnover doubled last year to Dollars 76m.
Frost and Sullivan, the market research group, estimated recently that the
number of installed video-conferencing units in the US would surge from
4,660 in 1990 to 162,000 in 1995.
In the UK market, analysts estimate that 3,400 video-conferencing systems,
big studio-type systems and transportable 'roll-around' or 'roll-about'
systems, were sold last year and that sales are roughly doubling each year.
Several factors are driving the recent rapid growth in dial-up
video-conferencing.
Firstly, the cost of equipment has fallen dramatically from about Pounds
200,000 in 1986 to about Pounds 20,000 in mid-1991 (for one end). According
to PictureTel's UK subsidiary, prices are roughly halving every two years.
PictureTel, which has its European headquarters at Slough in the UK,
introduced a Pounds 17,000 dial-up roll-about system in September which is
designed to work on 64kbps ISDN lines.
These falling costs have been made possible by the availability of VLSI
codecs, the advanced integrated circuits used in systems to digitise and
compress the picture.
Secondly, the availability of dial-up high-speed data connections like
Mercury's Switchband 64kbps-1920kbps dial-up bandwidth-on-demand service,
launched last autumn, means that users are charged on the basis of bandwidth
only.
Instead of having to own or lease expensive data connections which are not
used all the time, companies can now dial-up the capacity they require
without pre-booking as and when they want it.
In the UK now, inland video calls can cost as little as Pounds 15 an hour -
cheaper than a taxi to Heathrow from central London - and a transatlantic
call costs about Pounds 160 an hour. In The US, costs are even lower with a
coast-to-coast call costing between Dollars 15 to Dollars 20 an hour.
Thirdly, technical improvements have resulted in higher quality sound and
pictures over lower levels of bandwidth. Old systems used to produce jerky
images on 2Megabit lines while today's systems produce much more acceptable
video on 128kbps lines. While falling equipment and usage charges make
video-conferencing affordable to more organisations, a growing awareness of
other issues like the time and cost of travelling - and its impact on the
environment - are also adding to its attractions. This means that
video-conferencing is no longer just a boardroom novelty, but is also being
used by geographically dispersed project and sales teams, consultants,
specialists and others at executive and middle management level.
In the US, the biggest customers for dial-up video-conferencing are still
the Fortune 500 multinationals who mainly use it for internal
communications. But companies are also encouraging their suppliers to use
video-conferencing to improve communications.
Another factor which has helped boost equipment sales has been the agreement
of a CCITT standard called PX64 or H261 which will ensure that dial-up
video-conferencing systems interconnect with each other.
In the UK, both BT - which holds about an 80 per cent share of the UK
video-conferencing market and doubled its turnover from video-conferencing
sales last year - and Mercury offer public video-conferencing facilities for
hire by the hour and multipoint video-conferencing connecting multiple
sites, as well as selling video-conferencing packages.
For example, Mercury, which has distribution agreements with the main
equipment suppliers, can provide a full executive video-conferencing system
including an electronics module, monitors, cameras and desktop keypads and a
choice of network services options including Switchband.
Mr Andy Gent, business development manager with Mercury Datacoms, says with
confidence, 'we're at the right time and the right place -
video-conferencing is what people want and the market is growing rapidly.'
In the past year, a new low-end video-conferencing market segment has also
begun to open up and promises to have a dramatic impact on the office.
Desktop and plug-in PC-card video-conferencing systems built around small
video cameras and ISDN telephone lines have begun to appear and although
only a few hundred systems are expected to be sold this year perhaps as many
as 50,000 could be sold in 1993 including an estimated 8,000 in the UK.
Among the suppliers of PC-based videophones and desktop video-conferencing
systems in the UK is BT which has spent over Pounds 20m developing visual
services in the last five years.
Earlier this year BT, in partnership with IBM, unveiled a PC-based
videophone which will cost about Pounds 4,000 and be available next year.
The system comprises a plug-in videocodec card, a small video camera and a
connection to the ISDN network. Similar systems are promised by Compression
Laboratories of the US which has developed its Cameo personal video system
with Apple Computer and by PictureTel which has been working with both IBM
and Siemens of Germany.
Meanwhile, Hitachi has begun selling a desktop teleconferencing system
weighing 13lbs and the size of an ordinary video recorder. The Dollars
14,900 machine, on sale in Japan and the US, has two transmission speeds, 64
and 128 kbps. Hitachi says it expects annual sales of 2,000 systems in each
country.
By the end of this year, BT also promises dedicated desktop
video-conferencing units which will cost about Pounds 7,000 to Pounds 8,000
and can have document readers and auxiliary cameras added to them. (BT's
desktop video-conference unit is pictured on page one of this survey.)
Mr Ian Fox, a senior consultant with BIS, the IT consultancy, believes that
the longer-term trend will be towards these desktop and PC-based systems.
Until now he argues only a few companies with 'megabucks' could afford the
sophisticated high-end systems. But the potential market for low-cost
video-conferencing is huge and he predicts that 'we will see major growth,'
particularly because the recession has focused attention on reducing travel
ling costs - 'in my view, it's one of the most exciting, if not the most
exciting move in information technology today.'
However, he is much less enthusiastic about the short-term prospects for
home videophones already on sale in France and Japan and those like the
Pounds 400 analogue model BT plans to launch by the end of the year, or the
Dollars 1,500 model launched recently in the US by AT and T, because he
argues the video quality available at present is 'not sufficient.'
Mercury's Andy Gent agrees that 'it is debatable how fast that
(video-telephony) market will develop.'
Nevertheless, Frost and Sullivan forecast that the world market for visual
communications in general will be worth about Dollars 3bn by the mid-1990s.
If the analysts are right, the 1990s may well indeed be remembered as the
decade when video telecommunications came of age.

FT  18 JUN 92 / Telecommunications In Business (20): The networking
revolution - A look at the way that local area networks are sweeping the
world
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE BLACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LOCAL area network revolution is in full swing and shows no sign of
slowing. By the end of this year, around 35m personal computers used for
business, or a third of the total installed worldwide, will be connected to
networks within a single site, according to Mr Lee Doyle, a research
director at International Data Corporation.
He estimates that by 1996 around 40 per cent of the PCs in the world will be
networked and - in Europe - the LAN proportion will rise from 42 per cent to
59 per cent.
Market research produces very different statistics on the size of the
market, because of widely differing definitions. Figures for the total world
market for LAN products in 1992 vary between Dollars 10bn and Dollars 20bn.
Where all the analysts agree is that it is growing fast, probably at 30-40
per cent a year.
This growth has been boosted by a sharp drop in prices for many types of
essential LAN products such as routers, which help to gather and disseminate
information.
Most LANs have one of two configurations, Ethernet or Token Ring, both of
which are well-established.
At the lower level, involving cabling, bridges and routers, the principal
suppliers are IBM, Digital and BT, although increasingly challenged by many
others such as Mercury's DataComs subsidiary, BICC and Ungerman Bass.
At the higher level, the beneficiaries are companies such as Compaq, which
provides the powerful workstations, and Novell, the dominant software
supplier.
The first phase of networking began in the mid-1980s, when users began to
find that their standalone personal computers were not able to do what they
wanted. They had to be able to exchange data for most practical purposes.
The networking movement was pioneered chiefly by American businesses such as
American Airlines, which now has over 20,000 networks.
A second phase is being brought about by the trends to 'downsizing,'
'client/server structures' and 'workgroup computing.'
'Downsizing' and 'rightsizing' are the vogue words to describe the process
by which many organisations are moving systems to smaller machines which are
more economical.
Many are also splitting their systems in what is called a client/server
structure, whereby large databases remain on the centralised servers but
users can communicate with them from applications on their desktop PCs.
At the same time some are starting to adopt applications known as
'workgroup' computing, 'groupware' or 'workflow automation,' that enable
teams to share information more effectively. Mr Ben Smith, UK sales director
of Novell, talks of two cultures - the corporate culture and the workgroup
culture - and says that the barrier between them is gradually being broken
down by local area networks.
He takes the view that many senior information systems managers in large
companies, who grew up in the world of centralised mainframe-based
computing, remain hostile to local area networks and are obstructing their
expansion. This opinion is shared by some other industry-watchers.
Ben Smith expects that LANs will reach a form of co-existence with
mainframes, rather than replacing them.
Mr Hugh Jenkins, systems products manager for Compag, agrees on this point.
He notes that Compag is now building PCs specifically designed to run on
LANs, with special security features essential for LAN management.
The ability to disable particular disk drives to protect sensitive data and
to guard the LAN against software viruses are among the features that are
becoming standard in LAN-specific PCs.
The rapid growth in the market for laptops is not evidence for a return to
standalone PCs, as half of them are now used in conjunction with LANs, he
says.
Many large companies worldwide are finding real communication benefits from
connecting their personal computers, especially through shared databases,
both local and remote, online order processing, shared printers and
electronic mail.
Large computer users are transferring more and more routine applications
such as accounting and desktop publishing to local area networks. There are
also industry-specific applications emerging - for instance, to run a
doctor's practice or a shop.
LANs can connect from five to 250 users. Ten-user and 20-user systems
systems are still the most common, but there are signs of a shift to larger
groups.
More than half of the new installations are greater than 20-user. This may
reflect the experience of users who report that groups of 20-30 people
derive most advantage from the new workgroup software products such as Lotus
Notes.
LANs of 100 or more users are becoming common and many large companies have
400-500 user configurations. More LANs are being linked to each other to
create very large user groups, sometimes of up to 1,500 people.
Mercury has recently won several contracts for networking British hospitals,
including St Thomas's in London, where 2,000 PCs in five buildings will be
tied together. This is believed to be the largest National Health Service
hospital network so far and will be watched closely by other hospitals to
see if the doctors and nurses get the hoped-for improvement in information
service.
BT, the UK's largest computer user, is in the middle of an internal office
automation project on a much greater scale, linking local area and wide area
networks with the aim of connecting 50,000 users in the next two years.
This huge scheme is intended to integrate several proprietary office
automation systems.

FT  18 JUN 92 / Telecommunications In Business (20): Satellite networks cut
costs
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
COMPANIES needing high quality telecommunications at lower costs are
increasingly considering services provided by satellites, particularly in
the US.
Ninety per cent of the costs of running an integrated satellite business
network (ISBN) is fixed and predictable, claims Hughes Network Systems which
provides networks for companies to communicate through data, voice and video
to remote sites.
Hughes - a subsidiary of the Hughes Aircraft Company in the US - has
developed VSAT (very small aperture terminal) technology, using small dishes
for two-way communications.
Equipment at remote sites supports a variety of user applications, via
packet-switching and local area network technology, plus business TV
reception. Typical users in the US include Chrysler, the car manufacturer;
Wal-Mart Stores, the national retail chain; and Chevron, the petro-chemical
company.
In the retailing sector, VSAT technology is being applied at 'TV Answer,'
the interactive video pioneer at Reston, Virginia. Hughes are installing
1,000 satellite terminals for the company, to allow TV viewers across the US
to access their bank and brokerage accounts and respond directly to
broadcast promotion offers.
'Once it was something of a dream to be able to retail via consumer TVs,'
says Hughes. 'Now, with the systems similar to those at 'TV Answer,' it's a
reality - and, because it's a low-cost satellite system, it could now be
applied quickly in Britain without high level investment.'

European market poised for growth
EUROPE's fledgling market for PC LANs - local area networks used for
connecting personal computers in offices, so that users can share files and
resources - is poised for steady growth, says a new report from market
analysts, Frost and Sullivan.*
Although only just over five years old, the penetration for PC LANs reached
an estimated 7 to 12 per cent of all PCs by the end of last year. The
growing market for PC LAN hardware, software and file server products is
likely to be worth more than Dollars 3bn by 1996, the report adds.
* For more details, telephone 071-730 3438.
Hospital's improved switchboard service
EAST BIRMINGHAM Hospital, which adopted trust status in April, has purchased
a customised Callmaster voice processing system from Racal Recorders, to
handle its large number of incoming calls.
The Pounds 100,000 system will handle up to 50 per cent of external calls,
routing these through extension numbers, allowing operators more time to
deal with specific inquiries.

FT  18 JUN 92 / Telecommunications In Business (9): A way to generate larger
sales - Freephone services herald intelligent network era
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLIAMSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FREEPHONE services, still in their infancy in Europe, have spawned a
telemarketing industry worth about Dollars 8bn annually in the US.
As with hamburgers, blue jeans and credit cards, analysts believe it is only
a matter of time before the mass freephone habit crosses the water.
The term 'freephone' is something of a misnomer. In fact, organisations
receiving 0800-type calls foot the bill for the service in return for the
greater volume of customer contacts which result from callers not having to
pay to make inquiries or place orders.
Two variations on the theme are long-distance calls to corporate sales or
service centres in which callers are charged only local rates and the
recipient picks up whatever the telephone company deems to be the
difference, and country-to-country 0800 calling.
Either way, freephone is seen as a cost-effective way for companies to
generate large volumes of new sales leads or service an existing customer
base.
'One of the reasons that a lot of these services have taken off in the US is
that corporate customers have realised they offer a real competitive
advantage,' says Mr Tony Cobbe, group director for GPT's telecommunications
systems group, along with its partner Siemens, a main supplier of freephone
equipment.
Freephone calls exploit what the telecommunications industry dubs
'Intelligent Network' (IN) technology. Put simply, an IN involves the
addition of computer intelligence to the telephone network to allow a number
of permutations on the traditional function of connecting one wireline
subscriber to another and charging the call originator for the privilege.
As well as reversing normal charging procedures, computer intelligence
facilitates the introduction of a whole range of new services. Included are
offerings such as virtual private networks, in which unused public network
capacity is partitioned off for private company use; credit card calling;
calls to and from personal numbers regardless of an individual's physical
location in the network; the display of incoming caller numbers; automatic
re-routing of calls around a network to accommodate traffic surges following
televised appeals or disasters; and pay-per-use telephone information
services which encompass anything from weather reports to so-called 'sex
lines'. Cellular telephony is itself a species of IN service.
Initial IN offerings such as freephone were built to be accessed nationwide
but, to reduce operator costs, used a small number of large centralised data
bases which were interrogated over a special transmission network as the
need arose. Future implementations are likely to be more specialised both in
terms of content and geographic availability. This has increased network
design options to include smaller and more widely distributed intelligent
nodes.
'None of the operators are going to want to put in huge amounts of extra
transmission capability just to haul stuff to central or regional nodes if
some of the services are more economically deployed more locally,' says Mr
Cobbe.
Telephone operators worldwide are investing in IN systems because they
generate new revenues with much higher margins than conventional telephony.
They are also a way of responding to competition, where this is permitted,
and provide better tools for the overall management and control of networks
and services. Adding to its attractions, the IN can provide access to new
global service markets.
However, public telecommunications operators do not have the field to
themselves. In the case of 'value added' services such as recorded pop music
or sports results, revenues are split with the information providers.
How big the European IN value-added sector will become depends to some
extent on the interpretation of Open Network Provision (ONP) legislation
being prepared by the European Commission.
ONP defines the conditions under which public networks can be accessed by
private sector service providers and the trick for the EC will be to balance
the ideal of equal access with the need to preserve the integrity of the
network.
Because some IN services imply that operators relinquish a degree of network
control to their customers, developments on the ONP front will also be
relevant to some corporate users of IN services.
'I don't think that anywhere in the world yet there's been enough experience
of operating with a significant amount of user control,' says Mr Cobbe. 'We
don't know whether there are, or are not, any network risks which arise from
that.'
Like the operators, telecommunications vendors such as Alcatel, AT&amp;T NSI,
Ericsson, Fujitsu, GPT, NEC, Nokia, Northern Telecom and Siemens are keen
supporters of IN. Manufacturers view it both as a parallel market
opportunity for their established exchange systems and, because the
technology is becoming switch-independent, as a possible means of entering
new national markets.
'If you're big in the industry, you're big in intelligent networks,' says Mr
Jim Cochrane, director of the switching business unit at AT&amp;T NSI.
Just as IN services are not the sole preserve of the operators, so IN system
supply is not an activity exclusive to telecommunication vendors. Some of
the spoils of the new market have already gone to the data processing
sector.
Although AT&amp;T does not yet have a leading partnership in the IN sector with
a computer system company, other telecommunications vendors have deemed it
appropriate to work closely with the likes of IBM, DEC and Tandem.
It is a moot point whether data processing (DP) vendors will eventually
dominate the IN sector. According to IBM Europe 'The product focus in the
period 1995 to 2000 will be the service management environment, where the DP
technology strengths take place.'
Mr Cochrane believes the computer companies still have some way to go to
adapt to the stricter reliability disciplines of the telecommunications
business: 'The computer industry has not emphasised fault-tolerance to a
great degree and they've not introduced non-stop fault tolerance at all.
It's just beginning to be a factor in their equations nowadays.'
Whatever the truth of this, it is clear that the gathering momentum of IN
will present opportunities and challenges to service operators, system
suppliers and users alike.
'It will dominate the telecommunications market in the first part of the
21st century', says Mr Steven Timms, principal consultant at the UK's Ovum
consultancy. 'At a conservative estimate, IN services will account for 22
per cent of US telco revenues and 10 per cent of European revenue by 2000.'

FT  18 JUN 92 / Telecommunications In Business (6): Hybrid service now set
for rapid growth - Virtual private networks start to make an impression in
Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK NEWMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BARCLAYS BANK has a private telephone network for 250 of its offices and
branches in the UK. The network is made up of private circuits that are
leased from BT and Mercury Communications, and switches that it has bought
directly from manufacturers to route calls between its sites.
But having built and refined the network over a number of years, Barclays is
about to dismantle it and go back to using a service provided and managed by
BT.
The UK bank is a guinea-pig for for a new service called FeatureNet. This is
BT's name for what have become known as virtual private network (VPN)
services.
VPNs were first offered to large corporate telecommunications users in the
US in the mid-1980s, but are only now starting to make an impression in
Europe.
Virtual private networks are a cross between private networks and the public
switched telephone network. A private network is a closed network, and the
telephone lines that make up the network only carry the calls generated by
the owner of the network. The public switched telephone network carries all
the telephone traffic that is not on private networks.
VPN services offer reserved private capacity on the public switched
telephone network through the use of sophisticated switches. Each user
effectively has its own private network, but the network is defined by the
software in the system rather than by the physical location of the plant.
The switches enable the VPN customer to access a range of advanced services
that are not available to people using the public switched telephone
network.
Ovum, the London-based telecommunications consultancy, forecasts that by
1997, VPN services will account for eight per cent of the revenues of
European telephone operators derived from national services, and 17 per cent
of the revenues of US operators.
The impact of virtual private networks will be even greater for
international services. Ovum predicts that by I997, 21 per cent of the
international revenues of the world's largest telephone operators will be
accounted for by international VPN.
Cost-savings are the main incentive for companies to start using VPN
services. In the US, there were price wars between the long-distance
operators in 1988 and 1989 which led to a rapid take up of VPN services.
Today, most of the top 1,000 companies use VPN services, but as a complement
rather than as an alternative to private networks.
Cable and Wireless offers big businessness a comprehensive telecoms services
with products such as its 'global virtual private networks.' Multinational
users include Esso, Rockwell International and Grand Metropolitan.
In Europe, where virtual private network services are only now starting to
become available, Ovum analysts have found that large users expect to
receive discounts that will enable them to make reductions of between 15 per
cent and 20 per cent in their total telecommunications bills.
Barclays says that the switch to the VPN service will lead to savings of
millions of pounds a year in lower call costs, plus a one-off saving this
year of Pounds 5 million from not having to renew its telecommunications
equipment. Lower tariffs are not the only way in which VPN services can
bring about cost savings. The fact that the network is built and managed by
BT means that companies no longer need to keep a full-time group of
professionals to maintain the network.
BT says that this will free the professionals to 'tackle more important
issues of planning resources and develop new ways of improving business
performance.'
In reality, it is more likely to lead to a number of staff being made
redundant. Cost savings are not, however, the only benefits of VPNs over
private networks. For a number of users, one of the key benefits of VPN
services is the fact that they can be extended to outlying sites which are
too expensive to serve via a company's private network.
Barclays, for example, intends to extend its VPN to 1,400 sites by spring
1993. Its private network only covers 250 sites and the rest have to rely on
the public switched telephone network.
VPN can also provide more flexibility than a private network. Many companies
which lease private circuits use them to their maximum capacity only at
certain times of the year.
In the retail sector, for example, there is higher capacity utilisation
before Christmas and at sale times than at other times of the year.
With a VPN service, companies can mould their capacity around these seasonal
variations and avoid paying for capacity that they do not require.

ORGANISATIONS with large volumes of telephone calls for telesales, repair
and service enquiries have the apparently conflicting object of blending
fast, efficient call-throughput with impressive, personal attention to the
caller. This is the compound target of call-centre systems.
There are three computer-based functions within the umbrella call-centre
title: automatic call-distribution; voice processing and computer-supported
telephony. Once distinct, the integration process is now well advanced.
Automatic call-distribution, ACD, manages call-input so that every caller is
answered as quickly as possible and call-handling efficiency is kept at
peak. Voice processing, VP, deals with callers using automatic voice
systems, rather than human call-handlers. Computer supported telephony, CST,
is the automatic screening for the call-handler of database information
about the caller. Both ACD and CST also have outgoing call handling roles.
ACD queues incoming callers before answering them. The
first-come-first-served principle may be varied by such programmed
influences as priorities given to callers using certain telephone numbers
and call handlers' specialisations in given subjects or products.
Calls are allocated to call-handlers to give an even work flow unless the
system is programmed to release certain handlers when possible and bring
them back when required. Such reconfiguration may be by supervisor command
or automatic as call traffic levels fluctuate, or both, and may involve
co-ordinating several sites on a network.
The ACD function may be on dedicated hardware or may be optional software in
the PBX. Either way, it should provide supervisors with full management
information both in real time and as statistical trends.
Special Telephone Systems' Supercall series contains both dedicated ACD
systems and ACD/PBX hybrids based on their SDX switch and with
computer-supported telephony links. The company suggests that in most cases
the hybrid answer will suit smaller installations of less than 50
call-handlers.
Hybrids include Northern Telecom's Meridian ACD addition to its PBX range of
the same name, Mitel's Supervision system for its SX 2000 range and DTS
International's ACD 25 package call-handlers.
Voice processing may precede the ACD function if callers are simply to be
asked their account number, phone number and type of enquiry to route them
correctly - although good ACD integration will queue them, putting them to
the VP only when they will be forwarded to the relevant call handler without
further delay. Linked to a host computer, VP may complete the call where
enquirers simply need recorded, mailed or faxed information.
Computer-supported telephony, CST, starts with some identification of the
caller - such as an up-front VP system would provide - and obtain
information about that caller from a host database.
BT describes four roles for C
Capturing dialled-number information service data from the incoming call and
matching with product or service information from the host computer (where
each product or service has its own number).
Transfer of a call, together with data pertinent to the call, to others
without the need for the caller to repeat information or questions.
Proactive generation by the host computer of outgoing calls along with
presentation of data on the reason for those calls.
Matching CLI (calling-line identification) where available, to the host for
customer information to be presented to the call handler with the call.
One CST-user is Hong Kong Bank. Harris Telecom Systems linked to an IBM
mainframe use a recorded announcement to ask callers for their PIN number
with which the system locates their customer file. The customer is also
asked the required service so that the agent given the call has the
customer's name and the nature of the enquiry and has the information on
screen to deal with both.
Norweb take this one step further. Their Aspect Telecommunications system
has links to sales representatives' electronic diaries. Call-handlers make
appointments directly and provide sales staff with the information they will
need when they arrive.
Butlins' reservation centres illustrate the outgoing calls role. After seven
days, an Aspect system automatically calls back people who made unconfirmed
provisional reservations, allocating the call to a call handler along with a
scripted screen to confirm the sale.
To obtain data from - and eventually update it back into - a database, CST
requires a fast interface. Industry standard interfaces are well supported
by vendors - X25, 327OSNA (for IBM, LAPB (typically Digital and Hewlett
Packard) and so on. Further, the European Computer Manufacturers'
Association is working with other bodies influential on standards issues on
sets of CST messages.
The next development awaited eagerly by call centre systems purveyors is
Caller Line Identification, CLI, by which the public telephone service tells
the PBX or telephone the number of the person calling it. The CST system,
therefore, can obtain database information on callers still in the queue and
can identify, for later callback, any who ring off before getting through.

FT  18 JUN 92 / Telecommunications In Business (4): Information at your
fingertips - Credit-Checking Services / A look at on-line information
services for credit controllers, marketing executives and business analysts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN GREGORY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THIS MORNING postmen will be delivering around 13,000 summonses, 6,500
county court judgements and 150 bankruptcy orders to Britain's debtors -
both corporate and individual.
The anxiety caused by this 'paupers' progress' is not only felt by the
insolvent themselves. It also causes considerable grief to
credit-controllers as each debt represents a costly failure in terms of
administrative expense, as well as the impact of the debt itself.
A perfect system for credit control will never exist, but on-line systems
are proving superior to relying on hunches or even in-house analysis, when
assessing potential clients.
'Apart from making for quicker decisions when a salesman has found a new
customer, it also saves the need for in-house expertise in analysing
accounts,' comments Guy Glover, finance manager for British Steel Pounds
350m-a-year welded tubes business.
The established credit vetting agencies like CCN, Dun &amp; Bradstreet and
Infocheck have provided on-line access to their databases for several years.
These give details of corporate accounts, county court judgements and - most
importantly - their credit view on hundreds of thousands of British
companies.
International databases are accessible through services such as Infocheck's
Global Scan which provides instant access to information on most European
Countries as well as South Africa and Canada.
'The appealing thing about Global Scan is that you can see through the index
which countries a company like Colgate, for example, has a presence in - so
you don't waste your time looking in overseas databases in countries where
it does not exist,' says Mercury's Guy Robinson.
Furthermore, if clients need information on, say, a German company, 'they
used to have to hunt around for a week for it. Now they have access to that
and other information from one source,' says Simon Underwood of Global Scan.
'Our custom service also provides information on any private or public
company in any country in the world within, at most, three weeks.'
On-line 'libraries' of business databases are now being built up by
companies including BT and Mercury - 'this is one-stop shopping for
information. You don't have to have separate subscriptions to each database
and our help-desk acts as an honest broker as to which is the best service
for your needs,' says David Rosenbaum, of BT Tymnet, which provides access
through both Telecom Gold and Prestel.
Such services certainly cut down on bad debt. The Charity Christmas Card
Council's use of the CCN database through Prestel has helped keep its bad
debt total down to Pounds 2,000 out of a Pounds 2m turnover. Where potential
customer's credit references may be dubious, it insists on payment in
advance and last autumn found that six of these businesses failed to send in
a cheque.
'One of these was a firm which CCN showed had four county court judgements
against it during the previous 12 months,' says 4C's Neville Bass. 'Lo and
behold, two weeks later they appeared in the Gazette after going bust.'
With on-line credit-checking services, the main drawback for some users is
the cost which, with BT, is Pounds 3.15 a minute - 'there are simply too
many pages on each report which you have to wade through before you get to
what you really need which are the county court judgements and the credit
view,' comments Mr Bass, who finds that the average search takes around four
minutes.
'You start to wonder whether they put in a lot of guff just to keep you
on-line. It's like the long announcements on the 0898 numbers seem to be
designed to clock up the bill. And about quarter of the time there's no
credit view - just a message saying: 'Sorry, these accounts are being
updated.' '
BT is aware that time-based pricing is proving unpopular, particularly among
less-experienced users - 'we are already beginning to introduce 'per report'
pricing and intend to phase in this method for all our high-value services,'
explains David Rosenbaum.
Direct access to particular databases will, however, continue to be cheaper
for those using over a few hundred reports a year because of the bulk
discounts which are offered by the databases.
'For high-number, low-value orders, Infocheck is delightful because it is
simple and straightforward.
'All the other databases can be a sledge-hammer to crack a nut,' comments
British Steel's Guy Glover. 'On ICC and CCN, the information is a great deal
more sophisticated and useful but the cost of getting in is fairly high.'
His division has bought 'unlimited access' to Infocheck but he also uses
both BT's Prestel and Telecom Gold as an additional executive tool  - 'they
offer services galore and are instantly available. For example, this morning
I went into FT Profile to see what the papers were saying about a possible
merger which we're interested in.'
A communications package enables him to dial into Prestel and take
'snapshots'' of certain pages which are then saved on to his disk.
'It takes less than two minutes on-line and then, if any ofthe information
is interesting, such as company news or foreign exchange rates, I can
dial-in for more details.'
Dun &amp; Bradstreet, a market leader in credit-rating is generally only on-line
to direct customers, although it is in negotiations with BT and Mercury.
'I have a greater 'hit rate' when looking for a particular company when I'm
using Dun &amp; Bradstreet,' says one finance director, 'because it includes
trade names and not just formal company names. But the expense of the
service has often meant that, having found the company, I then switch to a
cheaper service to do the credit check.'
In reaction to such criticism, Dun &amp; Bradstreet's Philip Mellor says that,
over the past few weeks, the company has introduced 'the facility to select
items from an individual report rather than take the whole report.'
He claims that 'no other database also has such a comprehensive payment
analysis system as ours which shows the delay in payment over the past 18
months for companies in comparison with their industry sector.'
Rival databases emphasise different strengths - Infocheck's Ray Ruffles says
'our direct customers also get access to our instant on-line credit
insurance service, as well as free usage of our added-value services,
including company news and monitoring.'
Mercury admits that its credit checking library is 'still in its infancy,'
but it does seem well-placed to take advantage of the growth in the market.
Last year it secured a contract with Companies House to be the sole on-line
outlet for its database.
'It has become a magnet for all the other business information databases as
they want to appear on the same menu as Companies House,' says Mercury's Guy
Robinson.
Mercury has also signed a letter of intent for a five-year contract with the
British Chambers of Commerce for its Chambernet database which should be
on-line in November.
This DTI-sponsored project aims to enable users to produce lists of
information such as which companies produce a given product, which companies
import or export from a specified country as well as lists of company
officials such as IT directors.
Mercury has also been invited to join an EC-funded consortium to produce a
pilot scheme for a European business register.
Although Mercury's vision of a system providing pan-European credit-checking
and marketing information is alluring, the obstacles to its realisation
range from the incompatibility of European accounting standards to the
difficulties of translating the Greek alphabet.
Meanwhile, the key decision for financial controllers is to find which one
or more databases offer the information they require - and the cheapest form
of accessing it. Otherwise the credit checking bill might be greater than
the savings in bad debts.

FT  18 JUN 92 / Telecommunications In Business (7): Brighter prospects -
Electronic Mail
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PURTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ELECTRONIC mail has had a rough press over the years. It arrived in Europe
in the early 1980s, to the mildest of fanfares, only to be overshadowed
almost immediately by the phenomenal success of the facsimile machine.
The few press reports there were tended to concentrate on how awkward
electronic mail (or 'e-mail') was to use compared with facsimile or other
disadvantages such as how information - or even worse, usage accounts -
could fall prey to hackers.
In one notable case in 1986, Prince Philip's electronic mailbox on British
Telecom's Prestel service was hacked. In another, just last year, hackers
managed to disrupt what should have been a public relations coup for e-mail
when they filled an astronaut's mailbox with more than 80 messages,
preventing the first e-mail message being sent between the Earth and the
Space Shuttle Atlantis.
And in Germany, the Hamburg-based Chaos group of hackers pulled off a series
of stunts on Deutsche Bundespost Telekom's e-mail services which regularly
earned them space on the front pages of German newspapers, until they
decided to call it a day last year.
Given all this bad publicity, it is not surprisingly that the take-up of
electronic mail has been generally disappointing. Even in the US, for
example, where e-mail was pioneered and still has the highest penetration,
there are only about a million users compared to 6m users of fax terminals,
8m cellular phone users and almost 200m phone subscribers.
What is worse for the industry, the income generated by e- mail users is
substantially less than that from users of other communications
technologies. For example, while the average US fax machine is used to run
up a monthly phone bill of Dollars 90 and the average cellular phone user
spends Dollars 75 a month, the average e-mail user spends only Dollars 25.
But now it looks as if things may at last be looking up for electronic mail.
In an era of personal communications, there is a promise that the idea of
sending each other electronic correspondence may gain a new lease of life.
E-mail's 'store and forward' nature - where the recipient decides when and
where he or she wants to receive a message - is very compatible with the
mobility and flexibility of the personal communications concept. New
innovations are making it even more so.
A big perceived drawback of e-mail systems has been incompatibility between
many systems and the inability to send messages between users of different
systems. New systems are being based on so-called open system principles,
however. In particular, the X400 series of message handling system standards
developed by the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) during the
1980s are now forming the basis for e-mail systems which allow their users
to communicate with users of other systems.
Another ITU series of specifications, the X500 series, promises to extend
this inter-system compatibility even further by providing a standard for
electronic messaging directories - so that it is as easy to look up the
correct dialling code and number for another e-mail user as it is for
another telephone user.
At the same time new, more sophisticated, software 'front-ends' are being
developed for e-mail users so that they do not have to memorise complicated
commands to access their mail or send messages. Many of these now exploit
all the tricks of the computer trade such as windows and icons to make using
e-mail as easy as using a facsimile terminal. But the icing on the cake,
many observers are predicting, will be the ability to combine e-mail with
highly portable computers and radio communications networks.
Modems in portable computers have now become standard accessories. But these
still require access to a fixed telephone line which can make their use
while on the move awkward. Last year, however, US computer manufacturers IBM
and NCR and the Japanese electronics giant Canon all introduced laptop
computers with built-in radio communications facilities.
At the same time, radio networks are being planned or built capable of
supporting these kinds of terminals. In the UK, for example, Dowty,
Hutchison and Ram have all launched or are in the process of launching
mobile data services. Cellular radio mobile telephone networks are also
capable of carrying data although not very well - fewer than 100,000 of the
8m mobile telephone users in the US transmit data via their cellular lines.
A new technology being jointly developed by IBM and nine US cellular network
operators promises to change this, however. By exploiting the idle moments
of airtime between voice conversations, the group believes data rates of up
to 19,200 bits of information a second can be achieved; on a par with the
best fixed network dial-up modems.
When it becomes available in the US, early next year, some e-mail experts
are predicting a wireless electronic mail boom with a market passing the
Dollars 1bn-a-year mark very soon.

FT  18 JUN 92 / Telecommunications In Business (2): Badly handled calls cost
sales, money and customers - First Impressions / Many company switchboards
have a built-in frustration factor, but new technology is helping to ease
the problem of misrouted calls
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EXASPERATION understates your feelings. Attempting to 'phone the marketing
department, you reach the wrong site and are then passed to the right site,
but the wrong department. As the operator struggles to find someone - anyone
 -to answer, the obligatory Vivaldi 'Four Seasons' begins to play, vainly
suggesting an element of urgency.
Eventually you are put through. There is no reply. Each time the operator
checks you are still on the line, she is so quick you have no chance to ask
to leave a message. Your last quarter's telephone bill was horrific - it's
not too difficult to work out why. The only possible compensation is that
you'll save money by never buying anything from the sales department - if
you ever reach it.
Such experiences are commonplace, but no less frustrating for that. For this
article, it took four days of left messages and increasingly urgent appeals
to public relations officers to reach any executive at GPT-Siemans competent
to talk on the subject. At one stage it took ten minutes of shuffling
through one organisation to discover all its press officers were out to
lunch.
The problem is no joke. Missed and badly handled calls generate more than
ill-will. They can cost sales, money and customers.
But technology may be riding to the rescue. The cavalry is in the shape of
three letters - ACD, more easily understood in this acronym-ridden industry
as automatic call distribution.
ACD is designed to allow callers to reach a person rather than an engaged or
non-answering line. A sophisticated software system monitors incoming calls
and directs them to the personnel, known in the trade as 'agents', who have
been free the longest.
Simultaneously, a real-time information system provides data to managers
about how calls are stacking up and how individual agents are performing.
Mr Nick Doughty, marketing manager of business systems group at GPT of the
UK, one of the leading manufacturers of ACD equipment, explains how the
system can monitor the average time taken to respond and the number of
people abandoning their calls through frustration. Some companies have been
able to cut the number of abandoned calls by as much as 30 per cent, he
says.
About 6,000 ACD systems are installed world-wide, according to Mr Richard
Reid, managing director in the UK of private switching for the European
subsidiary of Northern Telecom, the Canadian telecoms manufacturer. Users
include banks, airlines, insurance companies, credit card companies, and
mail order houses.
Telephone operators' efficiency can be increased by up to 30 per cent using
ACD systems, claims Philips Business Systems (see page 9: Lost calls mean
lost business).
In Britain, BT, the UK telecommunications group, has installed 47 Meridian
systems supplied by Northern Telecom. The group has also installed 5,000 ACD
telephones as part of its customer first programme. The aim is to answer 90
per cent of all customer service calls and sales enquiries within 15
seconds.
Mr John Turner, head of planning for the programme, explains BT will now be
able to offer fault reporting 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. The system
will work on a regional basis, allowing agents to pick up calls from outside
their local area. Each agent has a regional database allowing them to access
the relevant data on each caller.
Other users include British Airways which according to Mr Doughty has
installed a system in four or five of its airports, linking some 300 agents
together. When one airport is over-loaded by calls they can be transferred
to the other sites. In the US, large organisations had even redirected
inquiries to different time zones, and even different countries.
In New York, one bank uses ACD to deal with loan inquiries. Once customers
have been interviewed for the loan they can call back, enter a code through
a touch-tone telephone and then hear the result of their request. The bank
filters out the vast majority of customers who are given a positive response
and can then deal more effectively with the minority of those refused.
About half of ACD systems are sold integrated with voice-messaging, says Mr
Reid at Northern Telecom. The most recent technology records not only the
message, but also the number of the caller. The system will then call back
automatically when required. Messages can be subsequently annotated and
redirected within the organisation for action, or even broadcast to everyone
else's electronic voice-box.
The market for ACD is dominated by Ericsson, the Swedish group, AT&amp;T of the
US, Siemens of Germany, GPT in the UK and Northern Telecom. The UK market is
worth only Pounds 50m a year, according to Mr Doughty, but it is growing at
about 10 per cent a year.
Meanwhile, the technological prospects for ACD will be enhanced by the
introduction of integrated services digital network, ISDN (see page 10:
Milestone for integrated services). Once in place, ISDN will allow companies
to use computers to identify the telephone number calling in, interrogate a
database, and bring up the caller's name and his relevant information on to
a screen in front of the agent. The agent could pick up the telephone and
respond with the caller's name before he, or she, has even spoken.
That sounds rather better than being lost in the usual telephone system
paying for the privilege of listening to an undistinguished recording of
Vivaldi.

FT  18 JUN 92 / Telecommunications In Business (3): Area with high potential
 -Telemarketing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By:MARLA MADISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AT least 50 per cent of all businesses already use the telephone as part of
their marketing activities in a planned and controlled manner, according to
the British Direct Marketing Association.
Mostly it is used to take orders, handle customer inquiries or make
appointments. The trend, however, is to extend the use of the telephone in
marketing to such new areas as establishing new business or managing
relationships with existing customers.
Telemarketing has several advantages over traditional marketing methods. Its
proponents say that it allows most companies to significantly increase
customer contact, lower unit-cost of sales, reduce the number of salesmen
and cars on the road, and add new dimensions of flexibility in relationships
with customers.
But most important, they say, telemarketing can allow organisations to offer
a significantly better level of service to their customers.
Recent technological advances in telephone call-handling such as automatic
call distribution - where rather than hearing an engaged tone when the call
handlers are all occupied, callers are placed in a queue (see article above)
 -and computer integrated telephony (CIT) - where computer databases are
linked to the incoming call, allowing call handlers to quickly access
information about the customer such as payment records, product preferences
or credit rating - are allowing companies to give a much higher level of
service, increasingly the most significant criterion by which customers
choose their suppliers.
Another contributing factor for the increasing use of the telephone in
marketing is the lower cost of phone calls in real terms. New services such
as 0800 automated freephone numbers have also increased the use of the phone
for placing orders, (see page 6: freephone services herald intelligent
network era).
According to Mr Richard Dorgan, the product manager responsible for
Mercury's newly-launched FreeCall and LocalCall freephone services, some
Pounds 150m worth of calls a year are made via Britain's freephone numbers -
'we expect this figure to double over the next five years as organisations
increasingly use the service to help maintain established customer-bases and
to attract new business.'
Customers, too, are increasingly attracted by companies which use the phone
as their main point of contact - as witnessed by the rise in popularity of
those offering their services by phone such as home banking, motor insurance
and travel agents.
Younger people are particularly attracted to buying by phone, according to
Mr Simon Roncoroni, partner in Leiderman and Roncoroni, a London-based
telemarketing consultancy - 'younger people are much more used to using the
phone,' says Mr Roncoroni, 'and these young people are the customers of
today.'
MANY businesses that now operate out of retail outlets or on a face-to-face
basis will move towards the telephone to handle customers, says Elisabeth
Gluck, chairman of Programmes UK, a leading telemarketing agency.
Most banks, also, are looking at home banking as a way of extending their
services and opening hours.
One of the pioneers has been the Midland Bank with its First Direct
subsidiary. Launched over three years ago, First Direct says it is now
Britain's fastest-growing bank with 10,000 new customers joining every
month. Every day, it says, it receives up to 10,000 calls, with nearly 50
per cent of calls occurring outside banking hours.
'There's no longer any doubt that the market for direct banking in the UK
will be substantial,' says Mr Kevin Newman, First Direct's chief executive.
'Our research indicates a potential market of up to six million people by
the end of the decade.'
Business-to-business sales are also increasingly achieved by phone. Even big
purchases, such as computers, are being sold in this way and stationery and
consumables have been sold in this way for many years. But just picking up
the phone is no guarantee for sales success - 'companies put a lot of budget
towards technology but not in developing communications skills,' observes
Elisabeth Gluck. Good communications skills, however, can significantly
improve productivity, she says.
Many in the industry fear what the European Community may soon have to say
on the issue of telemarketing and 'cold calling.' The EC's directive on data
protection will attempt to standardise the free flow of data across Europe.
How this data is gathered and subsequently used is now up for discussion.

FT  18 JUN 92 / Telecommunications In Business (1): A guide through the maze
of technology - The industry's jargon explained for perplexed customers of
the latest equipment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGO DIXON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TODAY's business telecommunications user may sometimes feel in need of a
guide for the perplexed. Such is the variety of services now available in
the marketplace.
The first reason for confusion is that users can become drowned in
techno-babble. Services tend to have acronyms which, even when spelt out,
leave customers none the wiser.
For example, ISDN stands for Integrated Services Digital Network, and MAN
stands for Metropolitan Area Network. But such translations on their own
would hardly enlighten the uninitiated. Meanwhile, expressions such as the
fashionable 'outsourcing' have different meanings for different people.
A second reason for customer confusion is that, although the state of
technology is similar throughout all the world's developed economies, the
availability of services is far from uniform. This is to a large extent the
result of restrictive regulations which protect monopoly telephone companies
in many countries.
A third reason for confusion is that telephone companies have not
traditionally been good at marketing their services, though this is now
changing.
Often services have failed to make a breakthrough because of inadequate
marketing. For example, free-phone services - which have been a great
success in the US - have so far made comparatively little impact in Europe
because their benefits have not been sold to customers.
At other times, the telecommunications industry has pushed services which
are strong on technology but do not address customer-needs. ISDN, which
allows customers to speak and send pictures or data simultaneously down a
telephone line, is a case in point. Now, after 10 years of hype by the phone
companies, services are only just beginning to take off.
Nevertheless, users have an incentive to cut through the jungle of confusion
because of the large productivity benefits new telecommunications services
can offer.
Communicating with customers, suppliers or colleagues is at the heart of
modern business. New services can increase efficiency in two main ways:
first, by increasing the number of contacts people can make, so speeding up
every aspect of business from design through production to retailing;
second, by improving quality so that communication is more accurate.
It is possible to classify new telecommunications services under four main
headings.
First, services which make it easier to track down people.
Traditionally, telephones have not been an effective means of making contact
with people. The person wanted may be engaged, not at his desk or there may
be nobody to take a message.
ONE solution to this problem is mobile communications. In the developed
economies, cellular systems, the main established form of mobile
communications, are being converted to digital technology which will provide
clearer communication.
At the same time, new forms of mobile communications are being introduced.
For example, over the next year the UK will see the introduction of personal
communications networks which eventually promise to use smaller handsets
than traditional cell phones at a lower price.
Another solution to the problem of not making contact is messaging. Phone
companies are increasingly offering their customers voice mail, the
equivalent of an answerphone in the heart of the network. Such services can
also be installed on a company's switchboard.
Alternatively, calls can be forwarded to a different telephone number when a
person moves location. A variation on the idea is personal numbers which
forward calls destined for particular individuals but not those destined for
particular locations. The first such personal numbers were launched in the
US earlier this year by American Telephone and Telegraph.
A second group of new services provides businesses with alternatives to the
traditional arrangement of charging calls to the line where they originate.
The most popular, free-phone services, involves the receiver of the call
paying the bill. These services have been such a success in the US that they
have changed the nature of the retailing industry. Many companies have
discovered that they can dispense with shops and use '800' numbers instead
to encourage customers to buy their goods.
At the other extreme, premium rate services charge callers more than the
normal rate, which is then shared between a service provider and the phone
company. Such services have proved a useful way for companies to get paid
for providing entertainment and information over the phone.
Another alternative billing arrangement is the telephone card, which allows
people to charge calls to their companies' accounts irrespective of where
they make calls.
A third group of new services relies on the fact that it is now possible to
pump more information down a telephone line than in the past.
Traditional analogue lines are adequate for ordinary conversation, although
even then the quality of the sound is fairly poor. But they are not good
enough to transmit moving pictures or large amounts of data.
For some time, telephone companies have catered for businesses needing
high-speed communication by providing private circuits.
The carriers are now providing high-speed facilities on their public
networks. This is the main feature of ISDN, which converts an ordinary
analogue line into two high-speed data channels (see page ten). These can
then be used for applications such as high-speed facsimile, video telephones
and desk-top video conferencing.
Other services cater for businesses needing even faster data links. For
example, metropolitan area networks (MANs) allow computer networks in
different parts of the same city to communicate as though they were part of
a single computer network. MANs are already available in cities such as
Munich and Amsterdam and, according to Mr Stefan Zehle, a project director
for Frost &amp; Sullivan, the market researchers, such services will grow very
fast in coming years.
The fourth group of new services can be loosely described as 'outsourcing'.
This involves a company contracting out part or all of the running of its
telecommunications network.
The main idea is that telecommunications has become so complex that most
organisations do not want the hassle of employing the specialist staff
needed to run their own systems.
The term 'outsourcing' covers a wide range of services, from the fairly
basic to the all-singing, all-dancing variety.
At the simpler end is centrex, which involves a company contracting out the
running of its switchboard to the local telephone company.
Slightly more complicated are 'virtual private networks'. These give
organisations the impression that they are using their own private networks
to communicate between branches while in fact calls are routed over the
telephone company's public network.
There are also many types of public data network, alternatives to companies
running their own private data networks. Such 'managed data networks'
started as domestic services but have increasingly developed a global reach.
At the top end of the outsourcing category, carriers are positioning
themselves to provide multinational companies with comprehensive
telecommunications services across the globe, (see page 11). BT, the UK
group, has been the most aggressive company in this market through its
Syncordia subsidiary, based in Atlanta, Georgia.
The essential idea is that a multinational deals with only one carrier -
instead of one for every country - receives a single bill and gets 24-hour
multilingual support to deal with problems.
Such top-end services are expensive. But, for customers perplexed by the
myriad of offerings in the market, they are the ultimate solution.

FT  18 JUN 92 / London Stock Exchange: GA gains on broker upgrade
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, PETER JOHN, JOEL KIBAZO and COLIN MILLHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A CHANGE of heart by one securities house led to a good showing by insurer
General Accident against the generally weak market, the stock rising 9
before ending a net 4 up at 472p. Smith New Court upgraded its stance on the
stock to a short-term buy from a hold and improved its forecast for this
year to break-even from a previously predicted loss of Pounds 30m.
Mr Steven Bird, Smith's insurance analyst, said: 'We think that, ahead of
interims on August 11, the composites will see further strength, in
particular General Accident. The market has underestimated the speed of
recovery, particularly in the UK, and with GA's yield being 7.6 per cent
investors will be increasingly confident that the dividend will be
maintained.'
Elsewhere in the sector, Commercial Union was firm at 499p and Sun Alliance
hardened a penny to 319p.
Dixons firm
Dixons, up a penny at 253p, failed to gain much advantage from news that its
Belgian property subsidiary had refinanced an office development in Brussels
for Pounds 93m. The group cannot make any profit from the deal until the
building is sold, because of a recent preliminary accounting standards
draft, but its subsidiary, Codic, can book a profit immediately.
Mr Andy Hughes, analyst at Nomura, said the net contribution to Dixons was
likely to be less than hoped, however, and could produce a downgrading in
profits forecasts. He has cut the estimate for 1992/93 to Pounds 97.5m from
Pounds 108m.
Holiday groups hit
A gloomy prognosis of overcapacity and tight margins in the holiday industry
hit the two leading listed package tour groups. Threats of an all-out price
war have been simmering for some time, with market leader Thomson promising
to protect its market share in the face of possible discounting by its
nearest rivals, Airtours and Owners Abroad.
Yesterday, industry figures showing 1.5m spare places unlikely to be filled
this summer sent shivers through the sector, with nervous investors only too
aware of the industry's reputation for fallen operators. Airtours weakened
18 to 274p and Owners 7 to 81p.
Notepaper and labels producer Porter Chadburn was the most heavily traded
stock on the London market yesterday as company broker SG Warburg Securities
crossed more than 12m shares between one institution and a number of others.
The shares were traded at 30p each in two blocks of 9m apiece and two blocks
of 3.3m shortly before the market closed. Porter's two biggest shareholders
are Gartmore Investment and Equitable Life.
Traders said 12m shares would represent about 13 per cent of the company's
equity and added that a large stake had been overhanging the market for some
time. Over the past week Porter has slipped from 45p and yesterday, before
the trade was carried out, the shares lost 5 to 32p.
Figures from Cable and Wireless ahead of expectations and an impressive
analysts meeting with management lifted the shares 20 to 560p.
Mr Robert Millington at BZW liked the trend in Mercury margins, although he
expressed disappointment at the slow growth in the business customer base.
He has left his pre-tax profits forecast at Pounds 740m for next year, while
Mr Jim Ross at Hoare Govett has raised his figure by Pounds 10m to Pounds
770m, pointing to 'the particularly strong growth potential in Mercury's
residential market'.
Dividend worries returned to British Aerospace and the shares gave up some
of Tuesday's rally to finish 9 down at 293p.
The announcement of a new chief executive at APV, after a six-month period
without one, helped the shares firm 2 to 122p. News of recovery in its
spares business continued to boost Rolls-Royce, which put on 3 to 169p.
Bargain hunters were seen in Lep Group, 2 higher at 6 1/4 p.
A 62 per cent interim profits fall to Pounds 8.2m at office and photographic
equipment distributor Gestetner sent the shares retreating 6 to 133p.
BET moved ahead 10 to 154p after broker SG Warburg reiterated its buy
recommendation on the stock.
NFC gained 10 to 251p after reporting interim figures static at Pounds 39.5m
and holding a positive analysts meeting. Mr Dan White at County NatWest
said: 'These are good results in a soft economy.' However, he trimmed his
full-year forecast by Pounds 5m to Pounds 95m.
County also downgraded a number of other stocks in the sector. These
included Associated British Ports, in which the broker cut its estimate by
Pounds 11m to Pounds 55m, and the shares fell 10 to 329p. A sizeable line of
stock was also reported to be overhanging ABP.
Boots rose 12 to 447p as analysts decided that the recent weakness had
overestimated the effect of promotion costs involving the Manoplax drug, and
did not take sufficient account of Boot's confidence in its prospects.
County NatWest said it was satisfied that some cost increases expressed in
the company's recent results had appeared distorted.
A rise of 5 1/2 to 95 1/2 p in Next prompted some speculation about a
possible bid. Turnover was a hefty 5.1m shares.
A decline of 14 to 583p for Guinness, on above-average turnover of 2.9m
shares, and of 11 to 658p for Allied-Lyons, in relatively thin trading, were
the main features in the drinks sector.
An analysts meeting in France with LVMH, involved in a 24 per cent joint
share agreement with Guinness, indicated concern about the level of spirit
sales in Japan, while Allied was said to be soft after a recent good rise.
Glaxo and SmithKline Beecham were depressed in late trading by a profits
warning from US pharmaceutical group Upjohn. The former retreated 25 to 710p
and SmithKline was 18 lower at 871p.
Mining company RTZ gained in a weaker market in response to a rise in copper
prices and a stoppage at Poland's big state-owned KGHM copper mine. A
technical squeeze also pushed the shares higher, finally 7 up at 630p.
A presentation by ICI today encouraged the shares to recover 5 to 1271p.
A weak dollar and some US selling was blamed for a poor performance by the
oil majors. BP continued its downward trend to end 4 1/2 off at 253 1/2 p,
but where, said traders, it was beginning to see support. Shell declined 5
to 510p.
Rumours of a downgrade left Forte 4 cheaper at 214p. Thorn EMI suffered a
fall of 8 to 825p on the back of a profits warning by Philips, the Dutch
electronics group.

FT  18 JUN 92 / World Stock Markets: Casualties and rewards on eastern tack
 -Emerging markets divided along geographical lines last month
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Casualties among the emerging markets in May were to be found in South and
East Asia and in the eastern Mediterranean, while Latin America as a region
held steady. The biggest falls came in India and Turkey, two long-term
sufferers, although the Philippines produced the biggest gain on the month,
reaching record levels following the largely peaceful presidential election.
Mr Michael Paterson, a director of Asia Equity, believes that Philippine
equities are due for a period of consolidation after the recent rally, but
that their long-term prospects are favourable. 'The market is poised to go
higher,' he says.
There is considerable excitement in the oil sector following the recent
discovery by Royal Dutch and Occidental in the Malampaya oilfield. The
discovery is expected to make a considerable contribution to the country's
energy requirements. First Philippine Holdings is expected to buy into the
Royal Dutch/Occidental joint venture.
Increased political confidence following the victory of Mr Fidel Ramos in
the presidential race, as well as an improving economic performance -
merchandise imports, a leading economic indicator, jumped 52 per cent in the
first quarter of this year compared with the year-ago period - should
attract foreign investors back to the Philippines. News yesterday that the
capital's two stock exchanges had agreed to merge is also seen as a positive
move.
Political uncertainty, on the other hand, has upset the Athens stock market,
which dropped 11 per cent in dollar terms last month. Having reached a 1992
peak of 1,009 in early February, the general index has since fallen to
around 800 as individual investors, troubled by Yugoslavia's claim on
Macedonia, switched into government bonds, which are tax free.
Mr Stuart Harley, part of the Greek team at Schroder Securities, says the
ill-health of the president, Mr Constantine Karamanlis, is compounding the
country's political unease. The government's narrow majority in parliament,
which traditionally elects the country's president, is seen as a potential
difficulty and could prompt a general election.
As a result, investors are ignoring the improving economic and corporate
news, and the arrival of summer is likely to delay any recovery in the stock
market until the third or fourth quarter.
Good first-quarter results have also gone largely unnoticed in Turkey, which
has suffered from a heavy fall in the lira and the dashing of the
government's unrealistically high expectations on inflation. The
surprisingly good headline figure for April is unlikely to revive the
market, since it was kept artificially low by the decision of state
enterprises not to raise prices ahead of local elections.

FT  18 JUN 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei drops to 5 1/2
 year low on arbitrage selling
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ARBITRAGE selling drove equities down sharply and left the Nikkei average at
a closing 5 1/2 -year low, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The 225-issue index plunged 507.73 to 16,445.80, its lowest finish since
November 1986. It opened at the day's high of 16,923.32 and reached the
session's low of 16,444.70 near the close. Volume increased from 230m shares
to 280m.
Buying by pension funds and investment trusts failed to absorb continued
arbitrage selling. Declines overwhelmed advances by 908 to 83, with 105
issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks lost 30.60, or
2.3 per cent, to 1,276.61, while in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index receded
5.37 to 992.08.
Negative sentiment spread as constant buying by public pension funds failed
to counter selling by dealers and retail and institutional investors.
Stricter disclosure on futures and options trading by the Osaka stock
exchange also discouraged dealers.
Indications by the Economic Planning Agency that it might be forced to
revise downwards its 3.5 per cent growth target for the year to March 1993,
in view of the continued sluggishness of the economy, also disrupted the
market.
Rumours that Daikyo, a leading condominium maker, was in financial trouble,
additionally depressed investors. Daikyo later denied the rumours.
Brokerages were heavily sold on reports of operational losses from April to
June. A Japanese brokerage official said low volume and high costs,
including summer bonus payments, have been hurting the firms. Nomura
Securities weakened Y100 to Y1,300 and Daiwa Securities Y45 to Y810.
Steel, construction and real estate companies also fell on heavy selling.
Traders said domestic institutions that bought the issues in 1988 and 1989
were liquidating holdings.
In Osaka, the OSE average shed 417.08 to 19,502.13 in volume of 20.1m
shares.
Roundup
THE TOKYO market drop and Wall Street weakness dampened general sentiment in
the Pacific Basin region yesterday.
The Manila and Makati stock markets announced that they were to merge. Mr
Rosario Lopez, chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, said it
might take six months to a year for the new market to begin operations.
HONG KONG gained 30 points in early trade before profit-taking drove the
market back. The Hang Seng index closed just 7.09 up at 5,853.84. Turnover
was HKDollars 2.8bn.
Banks were generally higher, with Bank of East Asia ahead 50 cents at
HKDollars 32.50. In the property sector, Sun Hung Kai gained 50 cents to
HKDollars 32.50.
AUSTRALIA slid further for the market's sixth consecutive fall. The All
Ordinaries index finished 8.3 lower at 1,631.1 in turnover of ADollars 270m.
MANILA fell on profit-taking after the announcement that Mr Fidel Ramos had
been confirmed as the new president. The composite index retreated 42.66 to
1,535.82 in combined turnover of 265m pesos.
BANGKOK gained ground in heavy volume. The SET index rose 6.55 to 756.29 in
turnover of Bt10.34bn. Advances led declines by 141 to 77.
TAIWAN declined moderately in active trading and the weighted index
relinquished 33.88 to 4,603.90 in turnover of TDollars 38.6bn.
SINGAPORE had selected blue chips stronger as shipyard issues lost ground on
profit-taking. The Straits Times Industrial index eased 2.44 to 1,517.44.
SEOUL's composite index lost 3.23 to 576.72 in turnover of Won326.5bn, while
NEW ZEALAND slipped in spite of foreign interest in Carter Holt Harvey,
which rose 5 cents to NZDollars 2.65. The NZSE-40 index shed 2.67 to
1,530.80.
BOMBAY's brokers continued to refrain from trading. Meanwhile in DHAKA, the
all-share index jumped 9.96, or 3.2 per cent, to 322.7 ahead of today's
budget for Bangladesh.

FT  18 JUN 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Philips sinks by 18% after
profits warning
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff and HILARY BARNES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A PROFITS warning from Philips sent tremors through the Dutch market, writes
Our Markets Staff.
AMSTERDAM was shocked by Philips's announcement that it was making a sharp
reduction in its 1992 earnings forecasts. A wave of sell orders wiped over
20 per cent off the stock before a close Fl 6.90, or 18 per cent lower at Fl
31.10 in volume of 6m shares. The CBS Tendency index ended 1.4 lower at
127.4.
Analysts were taken aback, as many had attended a meeting with the
electronics group last week during which the company made no hint that it
was about to take this step, which it blamed on weakness in the consumer
electronics division.
Yesterday most analysts cut their 1992 EPS forecasts from an average of Fl
3.50 to around Fl 2.70. However, some believe that the group will pay a
dividend this year, estimated at between 50 and 75 cents. Polygram, in which
Philips has an 80 per cent stake, shed Fl 1.10 to Fl 50.90.
MILAN recovered from a weak start to the new account on news that the
socialist leader, Mr Bettino Craxi, had withdrawn his bid to become the next
prime minister, paving the way for the formation of a government. The Comit
index, which reached a 1992 low on Tuesday, rose 0.9 to 469.69 in turnover
estimated at more than Tuesday's L104bn.
The Craxi news prompted short-covering and lifted shares which had already
been officially fixed. Buying more than made up for the payment of dividends
by 56 companies yesterday, which took more than 1 per cent off the index.
Stet, whose placement was oversubscribed, closed L102 down at L1,810 but
rebounded to L1,859 later.
PARIS eased ahead of the Irish referendum on Maastricht and a further batch
of negative company announcements made traders nervous. The CAC 40 index
fell from a high of 1,915.64 to close 22.57 or 1.2 per cent lower at
1,908.84 in turnover of FFr2.45bn.
Suez dropped FFr11.80 to FFr302.20 after the company said it would have to
make another FFr1.2bn in property provisions this year. Synthelabo dropped
FFr127 or 11.1 per cent to FFr1,020 in heavy volume of 149,650 shares after
the company said clinical tests on its anti-anxiety drug, Alpidem, had been
halted. Its parent, L'Oreal, lost FFr21 to FFr869.
FRANKFURT moved tentatively into today's Corpus Christi holiday and Friday's
options expiry. Turnover fell from DM4.1bn to DM3.8bn as the FAZ index fell
2.71 to 706.39 at midsession, and the DAX by 7.32 to 1,771.78 at the close.
Lufthansa, a perceived victim of the airfares war, fell DM6 to DM129,
approaching its low for the year. AEG, down DM9 to DM193.50, might have been
carried down by Philips.
Hoesch, DM11 lower at DM277, reflected a general downturn in steels on talk
of another broker's downgrade for the sector. Preussag fell DM4.20 to DM417
and Thyssen lost DM2.60 to DM234.50.
ZURICH saw Swissair bearers fall SFr7 to SFr732 as the SMI index fell 8.2 to
1,873.1. After hours the airline said that it was cutting 400 jobs from its
6,000 administrative workforce.
BRUSSELS's Bel-20 index lost 12.41 or 1 per cent to 1,189.99. Barco, the
electrical group, shed BFr48 to BFr1,312, reflecting the fall in Philips.
COPENHAGEN saw Baltica Holding drop DKr77 to DKr460 after Hafnia Holding,
which owns 33.5 per cent of Baltica, said its equity capital was down to
DKr400m, Hilary Barnes writes. The all-share index fell 3.89 to 319.02.
Hafnia Holding B fell DKr9 to DKr102. Banks were also hit, with Danske Bank
declining by DKr5 to DKr271 and Unibank by DKr7 to DKr159.
STOCKHOLM's Affarsvarlden General index ended 6.8 lower at 943.3. The
insurer, Trygg-Hansa saw its B shares down SKr4 to SKr53, having insured the
loan portfolio of the banking group, Gota, in which it is a major
shareholder. Gota A, however, rose SKr1.50 to SKr17.50.
OSLO registered its 12th consecutive decline, the all-share index falling
4.83 to 423.79.

The premium for LME cash ZINC over three-month metal closed at Dollars 86 a
tonne compared with Dollars 136.25 on Tuesday. At one stage it narrowed to
around Dollars 70 under the pressure of continued liquidation of nearby
positions, prompted by the Monday announcement of limits on the daily
backwardation. The market is starting to reflect its unspectacular demand
levels and high stocks after three months of being supported by the
developing June squeeze, dealers said. LME COPPER closed at the highest
level for seven months, encouraged by an early break through previous
resistance levels. Traders said an absence of recent Chinese selling on
rises by three-month copper to around Dollars 2,280 a tonne prompted early
short covering that touched off buy stops. Comex copper futures were
extending gains at midday. New York raw SUGAR prices were sharply ahead at
midday on strong trade house buying, constructive chart factors and
continuing sentiment that nearby supplies are tight. London COCOA managed by
the close to claw back some of the ground lost earlier, when trade selling
sent the second position contract tumbling to a fresh 16 1/2 -year low of
Pounds 523 a tonne.

FT  18 JUN 92 / World Commodities Prices: Wool
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
WOOL Australian wool prices continued to slide this week. The wool on offer
did not cover a full range and declines were not large, but the prospect of
an easier tendency at the close of the full selling season next week
discourages business all down the line. The Australian Wool Corporation has
lowered it's forecast for prices next season, now tentatively suggesting an
average for the market indicator of 600 cents a kg., compared with 620 cents
forecast when the market looked better and supplies were expected to be
lower. The market indicator on June 17 was 561 cents a kg., compared with
577 a week before.

FT  18 JUN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Belgian sale unsettles gold
market

NEWS THAT the Belgian National Bank has sold 202 tonnes of gold worth about
Dollars 2bn unsettled the London bullion market yesterday.
'It is very difficult in such quiet times to pitch one's tent and say yes,
it's bullish, or yes, it's bearish,' one trader said.
The Belgian deal was completed two weeks ago. After this morning's
announcement the gold price moved ahead on relief that such a large sale had
been completed without disrupting the market. But fears of possible copy-cat
sales from other central banks checked the advance. Gold closed at Dollars
342.35 a troy ounce, up 20 cents on the day.
Mr Andy Smith, precious metals analyst with Union Bank of Switzerland, said
the gold market had to ponder two variables: how much of the gold had come
on to the spot market and over what period? The sale also raised questions
about the role of central banks in the gold market.
Ms Rhona O'Connell, analyst with Williams de Broe, pointed out that when the
Belgians sold 127 tonnes of gold in March 1989 most of the trade had been
done with other central banks and away from the spot market.
Mr Wiktor Bielski of Carr Kitkat &amp; Aitken said that the Belgian move had
left about 50 per cent of the bank's total reserves in gold - which took it
into line with its EC neighbours. It would be logical to see a shift of gold
from the central banks of Europe and the developed countries to central
banks of the developing countries in the Far East, where gold reserves are
low, he suggested.
There is speculation in the market over whether gold will be counted as
reserves when a new European Central Bank is opened.
'If you are in any doubt that gold will be allowable, then you move it now,'
said one observer.
Another pointed out that while the sale had been handled sensitively, it was
nevertheless a sale at low prices. 'Who's next?' he asked.
The Belgian sale will yield about BFr5bn (Pounds 85m) of annual interest
income for the treasury, according to a senior official, reports Reuter from
Brussels.
Extra revenue would be welcome for the Belgian state, struggling to reduce
its budget deficit and saddled with a crippling BFr8,000bn debt, the highest
in the European Community in terms of gross domestic product.

FT  18 JUN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Mixed feelings on Indonesian
oil - Industry executives are down in the mouth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM KEELING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE INDONESIAN oil sector is proving the adage that there are two sides to
every story. Government officials are celebrating a record number of
production sharing contracts signed with foreign oil companies. But at the
same time the executives of the latter are looking increasingly down in the
mouth about the industry's future in Indonesia.
'Something doesn't add up,' explained one company executive, head in hands.
The figures compiled by government give the industry a rosy hue. Government
officials say 22 production sharing contracts were signed last year, and a
total of 61 in the last four years, more than during the most active periods
of exploration in the 1960s and early 1980s.
There have also been higher levels of seismic work: 84,000 sq km in 1990,
more than double the average for the past 15 years. Such a level has not
been reached since the initial broad seismic mapping of Indonesia between
1969-1972.
With only 36 of Indonesia's 60 known basins so far explored, the country
would appear to hold great potential. Talk to some of the oil companies,
however, and a very different picture emerges.
The last block to have reserves discovered in excess of 100m barrels was
awarded in 1971, officials say. Production is dominated by seven large
fields, some of which are reaching maturity. The majority of Indonesia's
fields, however, are small and discoveries have not kept pace with demand.
Oil executives say the level of drilling relative to the number of new
contracts of work is low. In 1990 actual exploration and development
expenditure of Dollars 1.26bn fell short of budgeted levels by Dollars 90m.
The companies believe last year also saw an expenditure shortfall and that
the government's target of 176 exploration wells a year, necessary for
maintaining existing proven reserves, estimated at 10.9bn barrels, is not
being met.
Government officials say new technology may boost recoverable reserves and
estimate that there are 20bn barrels with 'proven ultimate recovery'.
However, neither enhanced recovery nor the assigning of new contract areas
are expected to arrest a decline in output. The World Bank estimates current
production (including condensate) at 1.6m b/d, but expects this to decline
to 1.35m b/d by the turn of the century.
With domestic consumption of about 520,000 b/d last year and increasing by
at least 6 per cent a year, government officials concede that Indonesia will
become a net importer of oil by 2005 and will have to leave the Organisation
of Petroleum Exporting Countries. Some industry officials believe the day of
reckoning may be as early as 1997.
Some of the problems facing the industry are intractable. The bulk of
Indonesia's proven reserves lie in the western half of the archipelago where
past exploration has been most intense. The future lies in the pioneer
country of the Timor Gap and the seas and islands between Sulawesi and Irian
Jaya.
The geological structure of the area, however, is immensely complex -
twisted rock formations crushed between two converging continental shelves.
Potential fields are likely to be small and, even with three-dimensional
seismic technology, the search for them will be a hit-and-miss affair. On
the land mass of Irian Jaya, building pipelines from the interior to enable
the export of production would be hugely expensive.
Oil companies admit that tapping the oil fields of countries of the former
Soviet Union is likely to divert funds from Indonesia for the immediate
future. The problem is compounded, they say, by an industry wide shortage of
funds.
"Indonesia is getting a smaller share of a diminishing pool of finance,' one
executive explained. The situation is worsened, he says, by contract terms
which, particularly in relation to tax structure, are amongst the toughest
in the world.
Government officials discount many of the oil companies' complaints as
simple posturing. They say conditions for deep water and pioneer areas have
been relaxed and point to the high number of new contracts as evidence of
the oil companies' commitment to Indonesia.
The contracts, however, may be at the heart of the industry's problems.
Whilst their conditions remain tough, the contracts have commited companies
to relatively low levels of exploration; under the 45 contracts signed
between 1987-1990, companies agreed to spend Dollars 2.8bn over a six to ten
year period. The contracts have opened up new areas for exploration, but the
financial commitments of the companies are unlikely to be adequate for the
task.
The contracts will prove difficult to renegotiate should the government wish
to boost exploration and it may rue the decision to sign so many contracts
so quickly.
Company executives admit, however, that the government may yet get the last
laugh. 'The oil companies have proven to be poor negotiators in the past.
The Indonesians have tended to get the better of us,' one executive
admitted. It need only take one big discovery to prove the government right.

FT  18 JUN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: South Africa may abolish
agricultural marketing boards
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   JOHANNESBURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SOUTH AFRICAN agriculture could be faced with a radical overhaul of its
marketing structures following the government's decision to appoint an
independent committee to investigate whether agricultural control boards
should be abolished.
The decision follows in the wake of a report published by the Board on
Tariffs and Trade into food prices, which recommends that the statutory
powers of control boards be abolished, with farmers free to market their
produce as they choose.
Agricultural control boards - there are 22 in the country - suffered a
further setback earlier this month when the Cape Supreme Court ruled null
and void charges levied by the Milk Board on farmers. All marketing boards
finance their activities by levying producers.
The BTT report arose out of concern at the very high level of food price
inflation. Public criticism rose to a crescendo earlier this year when the
Central Statistical Service published figures suggesting that food price
inflation was running at 29 per cent per annum. The board focused on the
divergence between producer and consumer prices in respect of six basic food
sectors - red meat, maize, dairy, vegetables, broiler chickens and wheat -
which averaged 5.1 per cent during the period 1980-91.
The report concluded that control board schemes contributed 1.5 per cent of
the 5.1 per cent discrepancy. One of its recommendations for breaking the
inflationary spiral was to scrap control boards, which it felt were
contributing to a high degree of concentration in the intermediate levels of
the food supply chain.
The government has clearly had its hand forced in announcing the
investigation. Although the trend in agricultural policy in recent years has
been towards allowing greater play to market forces, Mr Kraai van Niekerk,
the minister of agriculture, showed little enthusiasm in a recent interview
for grasping the nettle of the control boards.
He noted, correctly, that agriculture was in a transition phase from
controls to free markets, but he was clear that the initiative for reform
should come from farmers not the government.
'If government is too prescriptive you run the risk of failure. It comes
back to you. The farmers must decide. I'm not willing to decide' said Mr van
Niekerk. The BTT report, and the attendant clamour about food prices, forced
him to change his tune.
Although there are exceptions, like deciduous fruit and sugar, control
boards in many industries have become alienated from the producers they
purport to represent. They are seen in the public eye not so much as
representatives of agriculture as a self-serving and unnecessary layer of
bureaucracy.
The boards are not going to give up without a fight. Mr Fanie van Rensburg,
chairman of the Agricultural Marketing Boards Co-ordinating Committee has
criticised the BTT report as prejudiced and said it would be strongly
contested.

for Budapest SE
</HEADLINE>

   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BUDAPEST Stock Exchange has become the first in eastern Europe to order
a computerised trading system, reflecting its ambitions of becoming an
international centre for securities trading in the region.
With Ecu1.9m provided by the European Community, the exchange is buying a
trading system based on Nordex, the cross-border market developed for
Swedish and Norwegian shares.
The exchange currently has only a handful of shares and bonds listed. But
privatisation in the coming months is expected to add rapidly to this list.
Also, the exchange hopes that rapid computerisation will increase investor
confidence that it is running an efficient and transparent stock market.
The exchange intends to continue with its open outcry market, and add an
electronic limit order book allowing investors' orders to be completed
automatically.
Besides the limit order book, the automation will involve equipping 55
booths for brokers, and two trading posts with price display screens.

FT  18 JUN 92 / International Capital Markets: Pubs group to refinance
Pounds 250m of bank debt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INNTREPRENEUR Estates, the joint venture company set up by Grand
Metropolitan and Courage in 1990, is planning to refinance Pounds 250m bank
debt with a 20-year bond issue.
Proposals for the secured debenture issue, arranged by NatWest Capital
Markets, were presented to UK institutional investors in London and
Edinburgh this week.
The funds raised from the bond issue will be use to pay down a portion of
almost Pounds 1.5bn raised from a syndicate of banks in 1991 for the
acquisition of pubs. The main Pounds 1.325bn credit was syndicated among 20
banks, arranged by Citicorp, SG Warburg, Barclays and Natwest. The granting
of security to bond holders has already been approved by the company's bank
lenders.
Bankers said yesterday that the reaction of institutional investors to the
proposed deal was positive. However, Inntrepreneur is a unique credit and
the structure of the deal will make direct comparison with outstanding bond
issues difficult.
The company holds around 7,000 pubs formerly owned by GrandMet and Courage,
a subsidiary of Foster's of Australia. The joint venture was formed in
response recommendations by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission, which
ruled that brewery companies should own only a limited number of pubs.
Inntrepreneur leases the properties to landlords on 20-year leases, longer
than usual in the licensed trade. The long contracts are designed to
encourage lease-holders to invest cash in the business and upgrade the
properties. If the value of the businesses increases, Inntrepreneur is able
to charge higher rents and generate additional cash flow.
The bonds will be secured on a pool of assets which broadly reflects
Inntrepreneur's portfolio of properties.
The pricing of the issue remains undecided. Pub operator Devenish this week
placed Pounds 30m long-dated debentures secured on its estate of pubs at a
yield 125 basis points more than long-dated gilts. However, the issue is far
smaller and less liquid than the proposed Inntrepreneur transaction.
The benchmark debenture issue in the sector, a Pounds 350m issue from Allied
Lyons, trades at a spread of around 85 basis points. Bankers said yesterday
the Inntrepreneur bonds were likely to be priced between these two levels.

FT  18 JUN 92 / International Bonds: EBRD makes its debut in Australian
dollar sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE EUROPEAN Bank for Reconstruction and Development yesterday launched its
first Australian dollar bond issue, the first of a planned ADollars 750m
borrowing programme.
The ADollars 300m, 10-year issue was structured as a global issue. The
registered bonds were sold in the Australian domestic market, but were also
distributed in Europe, the US and Asian markets.
The EBRD lends to promote economic development in eastern Europe and has no
natural requirement for Australian dollars. The proceeds of the issue were
swapped into floating-rate Ecu and will be held on deposit or in liquid
financial instruments until required for loans.
The decision to borrow in the Australian market was partly driven by poor
market conditions in Europe caused by concern over the ratification of the
Maastricht treaty.
Mr Anders Ljungh, EBRD vice-president for finance, commented: 'Our natural
habitat is the Ecu market and some of the higher-yielding currencies of
Europe. However, conditions are such that we will have to look further
afield.'
The 9 per cent paper priced to yield was 12 basis points more than
Australian government bonds. The pricing was initially seen as tight by some
participants in the deal, but there was buying interest from a range of
institutional investors.
The bonds were structured to mirror the payment and redemption dates of the
benchmark 10-year Australian government bond issue. Many institutions viewed
the paper as a proxy for government debt.
The EBRD is owned by European governments and carries a top triple-A credit
rating. In addition, it is a less frequent borrower than other top-rated
supranational borrowers such as the European Coal and Steel Community and
the World Bank.
Having been re-offered to investors at a fixed price of 100.174, the bonds
were quoted at 100.18 bid, for a yield spread of 8 basis points over
government paper.
Elsewhere, Hydro Quebec priced its CDollars 1.2bn, 30-year global bond issue
to yield 85 basis points more than Canadian government bonds, at the tighter
end of the indicated range.
Participants in the deal reported strong buying from European investors,
although the long-dated maturity appealed more to North American
institutions.
Salomon Inc, the parent company of the US investment bank, raised its first
public funding in the Euromarket since being implicated in malpractice in US
Treasury bond auctions.
The company raised Dollars 300m three-year funding from an issue of auction
rate notes. The senior notes carry a margin of 55 basis points over the
three-month London interbank offered rate, but this will be re-set through a
regular auction process.
The structure is similar to the long-date, subordinated variable rate notes
issue by banks in 1990 and 1991, but contains additional investor
protection. If an auction fails - if all investors try to sell their bonds
at once, for example - the margin reverts to 200 basis points over Libor. If
two auctions fail, investors can put the bonds back to the issuer.
Under the VRN structure, the bonds continue to trade at the fall-back margin
until an auction is successful.
From the issuers perspective, the structure allows the cost of funding to
fall through the life of the issue. Salomon is widely perceived as an
improving credit. This week its credit rating was raised by one notch to A+
by IBCA, the credit rating agency.
Nationwide Building Society has had its Aa3 credit rating confirmed by
Moody's Investors Service, having been under review for three months.

FT  18 JUN 92 / International Capital Markets: Interest rate on more foreign
debt fixed by Mexico
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAMIAN FRASER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MEXICO CITY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE MEXICAN government, anxious to protect its economy from the impact of
rising US interest rates, has fixed the interest rate for at least two years
on a significant part on its floating-rate foreign debt by using the
international markets in options and swaps.
Mr Pedro Aspe, the Mexican finance minister, said the government had also
hedged against possible falls in oil prices in the derivatives markets.
He said the use of these markets would protect Mexico from unpredictable
external shocks and enable the government to meet budget forecasts.
The Finance Ministry said the government had locked into an oil price this
year of Dollars 14 a barrel, and an interest rate of 6.25 per cent on the
floating rate part of the external debt covered by the Brady debt deal for
this and next year.
As part of the Brady deal with international banks, Mexico fixed in 1990 an
interest rate, also of 6.25 per cent, on Dollars 23.5bn of its foreign debt.
It also issued about Dollars 12.8bn of floating-rate bonds in exchange for
bank debt.
The government first announced that it had hedged against oil price falls
last year, although it did not then disclose plans to extend the programme.
It said the volumes of its purchases 'were very significant in relation to
the size of falls this year'.
As part of its continued debt restructuring, the Finance Ministry has also
retired Dollars 7.2bn of its external debt at a reported discount of 23 per
cent, through swaps and the purchases of debt in the secondary market.
While the debt was officially retired on June 1, the government has been
buying back debt over a period of months and placing it in a special
account.
The government thereby saved around Dollars 400m a year in interest payments
and reduced its external debt by 8.9 per cent to Dollars 73.6bn. The ratio
of Mexico's total debt to GDP has now fallen to 29 per cent.
The government in part bought back the debt with funds raised from
short-term Euro-commercial paper. At the end of May it used the Dollars
1.4bn raised from the sell of shares in Telmex, the telephone monopoly, to
repay short-term debt.

FT  18 JUN 92 / International Company News: Resellers tap Canada's
telephones - A look at the implications of a landmark ruling
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN THE two years since Canada opened its doors to discounted telephone
services, a host of aggressive companies, known as resellers, have carved
several hundred million dollars out of the established phone utilities'
annual revenues.
The resellers, who lease phone lines at bulk discounts from the phone
companies and then resell them to smaller users, now account for about 4 to
5 per cent of all telephone calls in Canada.
Their early success could look modest, however, compared with what lies in
store following a landmark ruling by the Canadian Radio-television and
Telecommunications Commission (CRTC).
The CRTC has cleared the way for resellers to expand the geographical
territory they serve and to gain access to the phone companies' own
discounted services. It is also encouraging resellers to build their own
networks, a move which would give them more control over their costs and
further spur competition with the phone companies.
'The pro-competition approach was more than anyone expected,' says Mr Tom
Davies, president of ACC Long Distance of Toronto, one of the 20 to 30
resellers which have set up business in the past two years.
The telephone companies, on the other hand, are furious at the CRTC's
ruling, which also opened up the long-distance market to competition for the
first time.
Mr Jean Monty, Bell Canada's chairman, is appealing against the decision on
the grounds that new competitors will make a much smaller proportional
contribution than Bell towards subsidising cheap local rates from
long-distance revenues, and towards the cost of connecting new entrants'
equipment to the phone companies' networks.
Most of the resellers in the market are expected to gear up for expansion in
the wake of the CRTC ruling.
Until now, their marketing efforts have centred on mid-sized businesses in
Ontario, Quebec and British Columbia, and they have been able to offer
services only between a limited number of cities.
They are now talking about extending services to smaller businesses and
moving into the other seven provinces. Call-Net Communications, the biggest
reseller, also has plans for a cut-price service to households.
An array of new products, such as phone credit cards and private lines, is
likely to appear. Most important, the CRTC ruling should enable the
resellers, especially the most efficient ones, to widen their margins.
Nonetheless, some consumers targeted by resellers in the US will probably be
out of reach for some time in Canada.
The Canadian market will continue to be more tightly regulated than the US.
As a result, the fee charged by Canadian telephone companies for access to
their networks is likely to be considerably higher than the 3 to 3.5 US
cents per call average south of the border.
The resellers' own ranks are expected to thin as competition intensifies. Mr
Douglas Cunningham, analyst at BBN James Capel in Toronto, forecasts that no
more than four or five companies will dominate the market. 'Small resellers
will probably not survive,' Mr Cunningham predicts.
The survivors will certainly include some of the British and US-owned
companies which already dominate the resale business.
Call-Net, in which Rochester Telephone of Rochester, New York, has a stake
of almost 20 per cent, says its revenues (including those of a sister
company, Lightel) will reach CDollars 100m (Dollars 83.3m) this year from
about 6,000 medium and small businesses.
The Canadian subsidiary of the UK's Cable &amp; Wireless has 5,000 network
customers and expects its resale revenues to top CDollars 50m this year.
Montreal-based Fonorola, whose biggest shareholder is J Rothschild Holdings,
will submit expansion plans to its board next week. The company, whose sales
are also around CDollars 50m a year, expects to launch some new services -
it declines to be precise - by next January.
The CRTC decision is especially welcome to the foreign-controlled companies
because it flies in the face of legislation before parliament which would
reserve a stake of at least 80 per cent in any common carrier for Canadian
shareholders.
The resellers are optimistic that the CRTC's ruling, plus their own plans
for investment and new jobs, will persuade the government to water down the
proposed new Telecommunications Act.
For example, ACC Long-Distance, which is also controlled by a US company,
has expanded its workforce in Canada from five to 52 in the past 18 months.

<TEXT>
HAFNIA Holding, the troubled Danish insurance group, has increased its share
issue from DKr1.5bn to DKr2bn (Dollars 331m). This issue is being
underwritten by Danish institutional shareholders and Paribas, the French
bank.
Hafnia's urgent need of capital was underlined by events in the stock market
yesterday. It suffered heavy unrealised losses when shares in Baltica
Holding, its big domestic rival, fell by DKr77 to DKr460, wiping some
DKr350m off the value of Hafnia's 33.5 per cent stake in Baltica.
In a statement to the stock exchange, Hafnia said its equity capital at June
16 had been reduced to DKr400m by the fall in the value of strategic
holdings in Baltica and Skandia, the Swedish insurer.
Hafnia said, however, that it believed it would be able to sell its
strategic holdings in Baltica and Skandia at a price above the current
market prices.
Hafnia's present troubles began when its finances became seriously
over-extended after trying (together with Norway's UNI Storebrand) to
acquire control of Skandia last winter.

FT  18 JUN 92 / International Company News: Japanese drug-makers slow off
the mark - Pharmaceutical groups are under pressure to expand and innovate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A RUSH to invest overseas by Japanese pharmaceutical companies in the late
1980s appeared to signal their entrance on to the world stage. However, it
has since become clear that Japanese pharmaceutical groups are far from
becoming the Toyotas or Matsushitas of the global drugs market.
Despite strong efforts by some Japanese groups, the country's pharmaceutical
industry has been unable to develop the world-beating innovatory products
needed to break into overseas markets.
Yamanouchi Pharmaceutical, with annual sales of Y226bn (Dollars 1.8bn) and
one of the drugs companies to expand most aggressively internationally,
hopes to be a truly global company within the next 10 years.
Fujisawa Pharmaceutical, Japan's third-largest with sales of Y227bn, says:
'It's essential for Japanese companies to globalise since domestic market
conditions are going to be increasingly difficult.'
However, western managers have doubts. Mr Thomas Hofstatter, executive
managing director of Hoechst Japan, says most Japanese drugs companies are
going to take time to grow into leading global operations unless a real
breakthrough product is discovered.
In the 1980s, most Japanese drugs companies started their overseas expansion
with simple licensing agreements and established clinical trial offices. The
more ambitious, however, set up joint ventures or acquired distributors in
the US and Europe.
Fujisawa acquired Lyphomed, a small drugs company in the US, and Yamanouchi
built a manufacturing plant in Ireland, a research centre in Oxford and,
last year, acquired the pharmaceutical division of Gist-Brocades, a Dutch
chemical company.
Japanese drugs-makers are now trying to build comprehensive independent
operations in research and development, production, and marketing. Fujisawa
is increasing production and marketing capacity in the US and Europe ahead
of the launch of FK-506, an immune system suppressor used to prevent
transplant patients rejecting their new organs.
However, compared with the multi-billion dollar mergers and acquisitions of
US and European companies, the Japanese operations and acquisitions have
been modest in size. Total overseas sales by Japanese pharmaceutical
companies remain around 5 per cent of their turnover, compared with 30 to 50
per cent of leading US companies and 70 to 90 per cent of leading European
companies.
The main barrier for the Japanese companies has been their lack of
marketable products, as most have lagged in the development of important new
drugs. This was due to their reliance on small-step innovations of existing
drugs, mainly lower-value antibiotics and vitamins.
Mr Muneyuki Sakai, pharmaceutical analyst at County NatWest in Tokyo, says
an overseas subsidiary needs at least four or five original mainline
products.
Exceptions to this pattern include Sankyo, with its anti-cholesterol product
Mevalotin. The drug has annual exports to its licensees of Y13.2bn.
Yamanouchi is known for its anti-ulcer agent Gastar, which had Y90bn
overseas sales last year.
Japanese drug companies have traditionally been complacent about R&amp;D because
of the government's pricing policy on drugs. The Health Ministry used to
award all new drugs premium prices, whether they were improvements or not,
and failed to give drug companies an incentive to develop innovative drugs.
Rather than take the risk of spending high sums on product development, many
of the larger companies chose to only make small improvements of existing
drugs, and distribute drugs supplied by foreign companies under licence for
the Japanese market only.
Development programmes have also been hurt by cumulative price cuts by the
Health Ministry, which started in 1981. It forced 10 to 15 per cent price
reductions every two years. This pressured cash-flow at the Japanese drug
companies, which are considerably smaller than their western counterparts.
However, attitudes towards R&amp;D are changing rapidly as innovation has become
the key to profits.
The ministry is pushing for innovative drugs through a change in its pricing
rules. From this fiscal year, the only drugs to be allowed premium prices
will be those which represent a new concept, are more effective than
existing drugs, and which make a noticeable contribution to treatment.
At the same time, foreign drug companies have started to end distribution
tie-ups as they establish their own networks in Japan, reducing commissions
at the former Japanese partners.
Ultimately, companies will need to establish a worldwide presence in order
to recoup mounting R&amp;D costs. Fujisawa needs to globalise because its market
share in Japan has hit a ceiling and profits have reached their upward
limit. Companies which do not succeed internationally will see a pressure on
profits.
In the long run, Japanese companies are expected to become more innovative.
However, for companies whose development policies are aimed at marginal
improvements, changing direction will not be easy. Mr John Wilson, analyst
at James Capel, says: 'Companies are under pressure, with sales of the
industry growing at 5 per cent and costs of R&amp;D increasing by 10 per cent.'
Since a typical drug takes 10 years and Y10bn to develop, only those
companies large enough to absorb the costs will be able to survive. Mr Sakai
at County NatWest believes that about 10 companies, led by Sankyo, Fujisawa,
and Yamanouchi, will be able to establish a position in the international
pharmaceutical market.
In the near future, companies predict a wave of mergers and acquisitions,
especially rescues of smaller companies lacking new products. Takeda, the
industry leader, says: 'There are a lot of negotiations going on behind the
scenes.'
Mergers and acquisitions by foreign companies, in line with Merck and Banyu
in 1983, and more recently Bohringer Ingelheim and Yamaguchi Seiyaku in
1990, are also expected to increase, as Japanese companies are now cheaper
following the slump in Japanese share prices.

FT  18 JUN 92 / International Company News: Olivetti warns of further
restructuring
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
OLIVETTI, the Italian computers and office equipment group, suffered a 4 per
cent drop in sales in the first four months of this year. It may need
further restructuring before returning to profitability.
The warning, made by Mr Carlo De Benedetti, chairman, came in the middle of
a week-long conference aimed at restoring confidence in the loss-making
company.
Olivetti last month announced a L459.8bn (Dollars 387m) loss for 1991,
largely due to restructuring costs, and passed its dividend. Although Mr De
Benedetti declined to give details on sales or earnings ahead of next week's
annual meeting, he expressed confidence that Olivetti would meet its target
of breaking even this year.
In spite of the fall in sales, Olivetti's volumes had increased in the first
four months of 1992. The difference was explained by the continuing slide in
prices for many information technology products. Prices for a 'basket' of
Olivetti goods had dropped by 15 per cent in the year to April 1992.
However, within that basket, prices for personal computers, which account
for around 30 per cent of Olivetti's turnover, had plunged by over 45 per
cent, while other goods had remained firm.
Mr De Benedetti said there were mixed signals in the market. While demand
was still constrained by recession in many countries, the process of
'downsizing' - the transition to cheaper and ever more powerful computers -
had reached a turning point, he said. 'I see the possibility of a quite
important recovery by the beginning of 1993,' he said.
The question of further job cuts at Olivetti, which has slimmed its
workforce by around 25 per cent in the past two years, 'depends on the
quantity of work'. With sales still shrinking, further savings might be
necessary, he implied. 'We will adjust our workforce to the success we have
on the market.'
Mr De Benedetti gave no indication as to whether Olivetti might move more of
its manufacturing abroad, especially for low-cost products. However, he drew
attention to the impending North American Free Trade Agreement, and the
impact this could have on companies, such as Olivetti, which are already
well established in Mexico, where labour costs are low.

MR JEAN-RENE Fourtou was yesterday reconfirmed as chairman of Rhone-Poulenc,
the French state-owned chemicals group, for a third three-year term.
The reappointment of Mr Fourtou, 52, a former management consultant, was
expected. The government was pleased with his record of building up a
profitable health care business to counterbalance the group's traditional
dependence on basic chemicals. This strategy partly explains why
Rhone-Poulenc was able to lift profits by 37.5 per cent in 1991, a good
performance during a tough year for the industry.
Mr Fourtou is among the 45 chairmen of state-owned companies whose mandates
come up for government review in the next month or two.
The government last month appointed Mr Louis Schweitzer as chairman of
Renault, groomed for the job by his predecessor, Mr Raymond Levy.
Mr Bernard Attali, chairman of Air France, yesterday looked certain to keep
his job for a second term after being nominated by the government
representative on his board.

FORD Motor of the US and Mazda of Japan have reached a preliminary agreement
to become equal partners in Autorama, the company that distributes Ford
products in Japan, Reuter reports from Detroit.
Under the agreement, Ford will boost its stake in Autorama to 36.5 per cent
from 34 per cent, while Mazda will cut its stake to 36.5 per cent from 39
per cent. The remaining 27 per cent will continue to be owned by individual
investors.
The agreement is expected to be finalised by July 1.
Autorama was created in 1982 as a sales channel for Mazda-produced Ford
models in Japan. Imported Ford models were added to the Autorama product
line in 1988.
Mazda and Ford acquired their equity interests in the company in 1989. In
1991, Autorama sold more than 75,000 Ford vehicles.
Ford declined to specify how much it would pay to build up its stake.
The US group said that the deal was not related to the company's previously
announced plan to purchase a 50 per cent stake in a Mazda assembly plant in
Michigan.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AIR CANADA has put its five DC-8 cargo aircraft up for sale as part of
efforts to rationalise its cargo operations, writes Robert Gibbens in
Montreal.
Air Canada has failed to make its key domestic cargo operations profitable,
partly because of the long recession. The airline saw overall cargo revenues
slip to CDollars 354m (USDollars 297m) in 1991 from CDollars 413m in the
previous year.
Air Canada said it was selling the DC-8s to reduce debt and bring unit costs
in line with other big carriers.
The five aircraft, which were used in Canada, are expected to fetch between
USDollars 125m and USDollars 130m and should find a receptive market.
Total cargo capacity will not change greatly after the sale because Air
Canada this spring brought three new 747-400 combination passenger-cargo
aircraft into service on its international routes.
Air Canada also plans to sell its credit card operation for about CDollars
300m.
Moody's Investors Service, the US rating agency, has placed under review
USDollars 1.5bn of Canadian Pacific long-term senior unsecured debt.
The move came after Unitel, CanPac's 60 per cent-owned subsidiary, won
regulatory permission to compete against Bell Canada in the domestic
long-distance telecommunications market.
Moody's said Unitel would face a financing requirement of USDollars 2.5bn
over the long term to compete effectively.

FT  18 JUN 92 / International Company News: Old memories revived at Philips
 -Confidence in the Dutch group has been shaken
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RONALD VAN DE KROL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PHILIPS' problems in consumer electronics could not have come at a worst
time. Investor confidence had been returning gradually after the upheavals
of 1990 and 1991, and the Dutch company's shares have stood around 12-month
highs for most of May and June.
But yesterday's surprise from Philips that it is unlikely to meet its 1992
profit forecast has wiped out the fragile, emerging belief that the group
may have put the worst of its troubles behind it.
Still, the dramatic 17.6 per cent decline in Philips' share price was a sign
of continued disillusionment with the company's investor relations as well
as a reflection about overall strategy. Analysts were taken aback by
Philips' announcement, but were quick to point out that the company is in
the same boat as most other manufacturers of consumer electronics. The news
was especially surprising because the company had failed to indicate at a
meeting with analysts last week that its consumer electronics business had
deteriorated further.
Only last month, the company had described its first-quarter figures as
'satisfactory', despite the fact that consumer electronics had slipped into
the red.
The latest profit announcement revived memories of the 'bad old Philips'
which sprung surprises on financial markets and failed to meet profit
targets. But there were also traces of the 'new Philips' which Mr Jan Timmer
has tried to create since taking over in July 1990: this time, the company
at least prepared investors for the bad news it will be issuing when it
releases second-quarter results on August 6.
The stock market's sharp reaction to setbacks at the company is a continuing
legacy of May 1990, when Philips unveiled sharply lower first-quarter
results without any warning. This touched off a severe crisis of confidence
in Philips' management, culminating in the early retirement of the then
president and the early appointment of Mr Timmer.
But unlike the situation in 1990, when many people doubted whether the
overmanned, excessively bureaucratic Philips group would be able to survive
at all, the company has proven its ability to plug gaping holes in its
profit and loss account. Under Mr Timmer, Philips acted quickly to cut
40,000 jobs from a workforce of 240,000 and slim down its computer and
semi-conductor divisions.
These moves have partly paid off, as is demonstrated by Philips' steady
return to profit since record losses in 1990. But successes are now becoming
quickly overshadowed by stubborn setbacks in consumer electronics, the
group's single biggest business.
Even before yesterday's news, Philips had said that its senior managers in
consumer electronics were working on a package of measures aimed at reviving
the profitability of selling compact disc players, colour television sets
and video cassette recorders (VCR) in a recession-hit market.
So far this year, Philips has moved to bolster its marketing of consumer
electronics in Europe by centralising the division's marketing, sales and
service organisations. It has also announced that its entire VCR business
will be merged into a joint venture with that of Grundig, the German
consumer electronics maker owned by Philips, in an attempt to strengthen
competitiveness in one of the most hard-fought segments of the market.
But if consumer electronics remains in the doldrums, Mr Timmer will need to
take bold action if he is to restore the confidence which yesterday's profit
pronouncement has so quickly swept away.

widens
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR EMILIO Botin, the president of Banco Santander, has been subpoenaed to
appear tomorrow before a Madrid judge conducting a preliminary investigation
into possible tax fraud. The inquiry involves loans worth around Dollars 1bn
made by the bank between 1987 and 1989.
A Canary Island court earlier this week released two Banco Santander
officials on bail of Dollars 1m as the investigation spread nationwide. The
tax authorities have been trying for three years to find out who a series of
off-balance-sheet loans were made to. The authorities want to know whether
these borrowers were using the loans to launder undisclosed income.
The issue revolves around what in Spain are called cesiones de credito, or
assignments of credit. They were widely used by Spanish banks in the late
1980s after the Bank of Spain, in an effort to slow credit growth, sharply
raised its coefficients - obligatory, interest-free deposits banks make with
the central bank to cover deposits and loans.
The banks found a loophole which allowed them to sell parts of their loan
portfolios to third parties - mainly large corporate borrowers - and thus
take normal credits off their balance sheets. This meant they would escape
having to make deposits with the central bank and of having to deduct
withholding taxes.
While the investigations do not imply that Banco Santander would have to
make any extra tax contingencies in its accounts, the affair is clearly
embarrassing. Banco Santander owns 10 per cent of the Royal Bank of Scotland
which, in turn, has a 2 per cent stake in the Spanish bank.
The assignments were made subject to central bank ratios in the summer of
1989. Santander officials said yesterday it had stopped making assignments
after the loophole was closed.
Analysts in Madrid think it unlikely the authorities will do anything to
threaten Santander's standing in the banking sector. Mr Antoni Zabalza, head
of the revenue service, said 'there is no question about the bank's
viability' when he announced details of the investigation this year.
The tax authority has been trying to identify the third party buyers and
find out whether they were declaring the loans, and whether Santander knew
what was happening to the money.
The revenue service says it has investigated 40,000 loans, worth Dollars
4bn, made by Santander between 1987 and 1989. It says it cannot identify
3,000 of the third party borrowers, and that a number of them may have been
fictitious.
American Express and Banco Santander are to issue co-branded charge cards
and gold cards for personal and corporate customers, writes David Barchard.
Both will continue to offer their own existing card products in Spain.
This is American Express's fourth alliance of this kind under a policy of
seeking strong local banks as partners in different countries. It already
has agreements with Lloyds Bank in the UK, Sumitomo in Japan, and Banamex in
Mexico to issue co-branded cards.

THE SKI industry's revival will strengthen this year, according to Skis
Rossignol, the leading French producer of skis, tennis rackets and golf
clubs.
The group yesterday announced a larger-than-expected loss for last year, but
expects to be profitable in the current 12 months, thanks to strong growth
in ski equipment sales. The Grenoble-based group also expects to benefit
from improved productivity and lower costs.
Net losses in the year to end-March were FFr53.9m (Dollars 10.22m), slightly
above earlier company forecasts of FFr35m to FFr40m. But this was less than
half the previous year's loss of FFr140.8m, due to recession and shortage of
snow in the Alps. Since then, weather, if not economic conditions, have
improved. Skis Rossignol's turnover rose by 6.1 per cent to FFr1.48bn last
year.

NCC, one of Sweden's leading property and construction groups, improved its
profits (after financial items) for the first four months to SKr249m
(Dollars 44m) from SKr158m for the same period last year. Consolidated sales
fell to SKr7.228bn from SKr7.682bn for the first four months of 1991.
Its construction division profit (after financial items) fell to SKr270m
from SKr295m while sales also dropped to SKr5.457bn from SKr5.636bn, but
orders were up by 4 per cent to SKr6.1bn from SKr5.8bn.
The SKr10m loss from the international division was less than the one of
SKr15m suffered in the first four months of last year. But there was a
marked deterioration in NCC's special company business with a loss of SKr40m
against SKr5m for the same period of 1991.
However, the group's property activities showed signs of improvement. From a
loss of SKr48m for the January - April period of last year it recorded a
profit of SKr92m for the same months of 1992 with a SKr149m gain from
property sales, while sales rose to SKr408m from SKr307m for the first four
months of last year. Metsa-Serla, Finland's third-largest forestry group,
reported yesterday a FM2m (Dollars 476m) loss for the first four months
compared with a FM59m deficit for the same period of 1991.
Mr Timo Poranen, the company's president and chief executive, said he
expected 'greatly improved financial result' over last year's FM117m loss,
although a small loss was likely .
Net sales climbed by 6 per cent in the first four months to FM2.637bn from
FM2.486bn and the operating profit rose by 76.2 per cent to FM229m from
FM130m. However, there was a loss per share of FM8.35 compared with a loss
per share of FM13.35 last year.

<TEXT>
MR RUPERT Murdoch, the Australian-born media group owner, yesterday joined
forces with a Spanish magazine publisher and Mr Mario Conde, president of
the Banesto banking and industrial group, in a boardroom coup at one of
Spain's commercial television channels, Antena 3 TV.
A board meeting in Madrid yesterday elected Mr Antonio Asensio, president of
the Grupo Zeta publishing group, chairman of Antena 3 after the resignation
of Mr Javier Godo, the Count of Godo, who founded the channel nearly three
years ago and who is owner of Spain's oldest newspaper, La Vanguardia.
Mr Murdoch and Mr Conde were also elected to the board. The move came after
Mr Murdoch and Mr Asensio formed a joint venture and bought up to 25 per
cent of Antena 3 from minority shareholders. Mr Conde is separately
understood to have bought a further 20 per cent of the channel. The stealthy
stock purchases, reportedly worth some Dollars 100m, were financed by
Banesto.
Antena 3 owns the daily newspaper, Ya, which circulates mainly in Madrid. Mr
Murdoch's holding company, News International, has held a 25 per cent stake
in Grupo Zeta for some time. Zeta bid for and failed to win one of the three
private TV licences the Spanish government awarded in 1989.
The government has to approve the new ownership and while it was said to be
irritated by the coup - it views Mr Conde as a potentially dangerous
conservative political rival to the ruling socialist party - officials at
the prime minister's office said the new shareholdings would be respected.
Earlier this year, Mr Conde signed an agreement with Mr Godo under which
Banesto would take stakes in Antena 3 TV and La Vanguardia. But after
pressure from the government and journalists on La Vanguardia, he reneged on
the deal.

FT  18 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Acquisitions help Chemring profits improve
to Pounds 2.65m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BOTH ORGANIC growth and 'the successful integration of the acquisitions made
in 1991' helped Chemring Group lift pre-tax profits almost 10 per cent from
Pounds 2.41m to Pounds 2.65m in the half-year to March 27.
Mr Philip Billington, who became chairman on January 1, said he was aiming
to increase Chemring's non-defence side to 60 per cent, though he stressed
that the defence side made 'defensive, rather than offensive products', such
as radar countermeasures and flares.
Group turnover rose almost 20 per cent to Pounds 18.5m (Pounds 15.4m), with
acquisitions accounting for Pounds 2m of the rise.
In May 1991 the company bought Octavius Hunt - which makes smoke pesticides,
sparklers and specialist matches - for Pounds 1.54m in cash, shares and loan
notes. In July it paid FFr6.5m for 49 per cent of Traco, the French
electrical transformer manufacturer, to combine with Securelec of which it
also owns 49 per cent. In August it added Horace Sleep to its Vacuum Reflex
specialist clothing company and in September the marine division of Kilgore
was absorbed into the pyrotechnic operations of Pains-Wessex.
The group has 70 per cent of the global market for marine pyrotechnics.
Chemring would go to the market for larger acquisitions, said Mr Billington,
but had Pounds 3.1m cash at the period-end for smaller buys.
He was looking for companies 'with markets and manufacturing processes we
understand', and would be keen to use Chemring's existing global
distribution network.
He said in the UK Chemring was essentially a defence company but in the
export market 60 per cent was in non-defence.
He specially wanted to grow the environmental side - Chemring's and Wessex
Water's pilot plant in Avonmouth will continue until December to fine-tune
plans for a full-scale plant to recycle treated sewage into an organic
fertiliser.
Earnings emerged at 35.54p (31.39p) per share and the interim dividend is
lifted 10 per cent to 10.9p (9.9p).
The shares were unchanged at 883p.

FT  18 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Booker changes reporting periods
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BOOKER, the food distribution, agribusiness and prepared foods group, is
changing the reporting periods for its results.
Starting in the current financial year, the group will base its figures on
13 four-weekly periods rather than 12 calendar months.
Booker said the change would make no difference to its dividend policy, but
would make management accounting more efficient and help the group's
treasury department. Booker shares rose 1p to 482p.
As a result of the accounting period change the current financial year will
end on December 26, while the next year will end on January 1 1994.
When interim profits are announced in September they will cover 24 weeks to
June 13, rather than six months to June 30.
However, an indicative pre-tax profit figure on the old basis will also be
given.
Booker yesterday published the 1991 interim results on the new basis. These
figures will provide the comparison for the current year's interim results.
In the first 24 weeks of 1991 turnover was Pounds 1.44bn, pre-interest
profits were Pounds 44.3m, and pre-tax profits were Pounds 32.9m.
Earnings per share were 11.56p.
Mr Jonathan Taylor, chief executive, said that the change would cause some
distortion as the summer period was a peak trading time for the food
distribution activities.
In the last two weeks of June 1991 Booker had made pre-tax profits of Pounds
4.9m on sales of Pounds 125.9m.
The group also announced it was buying a fish processing complex in Grimsby
from Findus, part of Nestle.
Findus said it would sell the site nearly a year ago. The purchase price is
not disclosed, though analysts reckoned it would be be only a few million
pounds.
Booker is also getting a 'substantial' grant from the Department of Trade
and Industry.

FT  18 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Gestetner suffers further decline to Pounds
8.2m midway
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GESTETNER, the office and photographic equipment distributor, yesterday
reported a further sharp fall in profits at the interim stage after a
decline to Pounds 22.5m in 1990-91 .
The six months to April 30 achieved pre-tax profits of Pounds 8.2m, down by
almost two thirds from Pounds 21.7m in the comparable period.
Mr Basil Sellers, chairman, said the office systems division suffered
reduced margins due to changing product mixes and recession. Photographic
equipment saw no recovery in sales.
But the figures included Pounds 3m of redundancy and other costs as 300 more
jobs went, following last year's cuts of 1,000. 'We've got the costs down
and will now just have to wait for the improvement to come,' Mr Sellers
said.
Group turnover fell to Pounds 440.1m (Pounds 451.1m). The UK contribution
fell from Pounds 27.4m to Pounds 19.9m due to recession, while continental
sales fell 9 per cent to Pounds 206.9m (Pounds 228.4m). Gestetner Canada is
being restructured after suffering a Pounds 3m loss.
Interest charges fell to Pounds 5.4m (Pounds 7.9m) as net debt fell to
Pounds 96.4m, including Pounds 37.9m of convertible unsecured loan stock.
This compares to net debt of Pounds 193m a year ago, and follows the
conversion of Pounds 78m of loan stock last September. As a result, the debt
to equity ratio fell to 40 per cent (114 per cent).
Earnings fell to 6.2p (16.7p) or 3.8p (10.4p) fully diluted. The dividend
payments of 1.8p per ordinary share and 0.075p per ordinary capital share
are unchanged on last time.
The shares fell 6p to 133p.
COMMENT
These figures were as expected, but Gestetner could have done without the
Canadian losses. Costs are now under control, although cost savings are
being cancelled out by inflation. Revenues from service contracts have
provided some protection from the recession, the company is more reliant on
the upturn and resumed buying of new office equipment. However, that looks
unlikely to happen in this financial year and full-year forecasts of Pounds
19m-Pounds 20m put the shares on a slightly optimistic 15 times. While the
range and quality of the company's products, and its large sales force,
augur well for the longer term, the shares may not go much higher yet.

FT  18 JUN 92 / UK Company News: A new look that sees beyond ships - The
refocused Powell Duffyn which is searching for capital growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
POWELL Duffryn's recent decision to get out of ship-owning is the latest
stage in the group's continuing evolution away from its 19th century origins
in the coal fields of South Wales.
Cash from the Pounds 19m sale of Stephenson Clarke, one of the most famous
names in British shipping, will be invested in the engineering, fuel and
bulk liquid storage businesses which Powell Duffryn has concentrated on
since the post-war nationalisation of the mines removed its founding
product.
Fuel distribution has never been a glamorous business, but it proved
sufficiently cash generative for Powell Duffryn to escape a Pounds 170m
hostile bid from Lord Hanson in 1985 - a trick which has proved beyond many
more dynamic companies.
The group maintained its independence by promising to continue paying high
dividends - a pledge which has been kept, even though the share price has
underperformed the FT-Allshare over the last six years.
Mr David Hubbard, who stepped up from finance director to become chairman of
Powell Duffryn after Hanson was seen off, said the takeover was not a wholly
negative experience: 'Any activity like that is a catalyst for change - as
ICI has discovered.'
He and Mr Bill Andrews, the new chief executive, set about reducing the
group's exposure to the construction indust-ry.
The Pounds 20m proceeds from the sale of the group's timber business in 1986
helped fund five acquisitions made the following year in engineering, the
sector chosen as having most growth potential.
That focus seemed to be paying off by 1990, when engineering contributed 48
per cent of the group's trading profits. The impact of recession reduced
that contribution to 36 per cent last year, but the group is still
determined to concentrate more on engineering.
Mr Andrews said the group had selected three areas where it has built at
least a European position and potentially could become a world player -
combustion technology, railway bogies and marine products such as pumps and
compressors.
The group's Hamworthy businesses install and manage burner installations in
many of the world's biggest power stations.
Mr Andrews said: 'A large part of pollution is coming from combustion, and
there is a very positive opportunity to improve that with high-technology
combustion management systems. If you look at the East European opportunity,
it is almost horrifying, and yet it has all got be dealt with.'
He added: 'We intend to grow that business, and acknowledge that it will not
be grown sitting on our backsides in the UK - the next target market has got
to be the Pacific Rim.'
Hamworthy is also a leading supplier of marine equipment such as pumps and
compressors. 'We have a worldwide distribution network, with heavy demand
for spares, said Mr Andrews.
'The world's shipping fleet is nearly 15 years old, and quite clearly the
rate of replacement of that fleet over the next decade is bound to rise.'
Powell Duffryn's biggest opportunity - and current problem - on the
engineering side is its railway business.
It has invested heavily in building a freight wagon base - known as a bogie
 -for use on both sides of the Channel.
Mr Andrews said: 'We have the right product, but the potential customers
currently don't have the capital capacity to place the orders.'
Mr Hubbard said: 'This business is losing money for us at the moment, and
there must be a question of a time limit on how long we are to go on doing
that.'
Powell Duffryn's fuel distribution business is now wholly in the UK. The
group's biggest offshore investment is in its bulk liquid storage business,
which is spread across five continents.
The bulk liquids business has changed radically since the last oil price
crisis, with increased computerisation allowing oil and chemical companies
to manage their operations much more effectively, with less storage.
Powell Duffryn has responded by specialising in the storage of more
difficult products and by providing more services - in the US it packages
16m gallons of anti-freeze for the retail market.
Mr Hubbard said: 'All of the time we are looking for higher value-added
services in this sector, because that is where the future is going to lie.'
The group has invested heavily to keep its storage terminals up with
increasingly stringent environmental regulations, confident that such
expenditure will be justified by enhanced profit margins when there is
economic recovery.
However, this demand for investment came at a time when Stephenson Clarke
had not replaced any vessels for five years and was facing the need to buy
new ships over the next four to five years.
Mr Andrews said: 'You cannot sustain two businesses with that sort of
appetite for capital within our particular group. I'm not saying they are
mutually exclusive - they just were for us.'
Despite its exit from ship-owning, the group remains interested in
shipping-related businesses. It recently invested Pounds 13.7m in the
consortium Powell Duffryn leads, which in December successfully bid Pounds
180m for control of the Tees and Hartlepool Port Authority, the first major
trust port to be privatised.
The group's reshaping continues, with the sale already this year of its
remaining foundry interests and further shrinkage likely on the construction
materials side.
One thing that had not changed - at least until this month's
better-than-expected annual results - was the perception of Powell Duffryn
as a rather boring yield stock.
Mr Hubbard said: 'I believe that over five years, as we develop the group,
we will be appreciated as more of a capital growth potential stock, and
therefore less as an income stock.
'It's no use my going out to shareholders and saying forget about income,
because they would ditch us tomorrow. The share price has kept the yield up
by performing disappointingly. As the share price increases, the yield comes
back into the 7 to 8 per cent range. That's still a jolly good yield for a
stock with a bit of capital potential.'
Just how much potential the new-look Powell Duffryn has for capital growth
will depend on the pace of economic recovery and the performance of the
engineering businesses in which the group has invested.

FT  18 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Martin Currie offer for Pacific Horizon
lapses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Martin Currie Pacific investment trust yesterday announced that it had
allowed its offer for Pacific Horizon investment trust to lapse.
It did so although the offer had been unanimously recommended by Pacific
Horizon's board, and had been accepted by 74.51 per cent of shareholders and
54.42 per cent of warrant holders.
This suggested that Jupiter Tyndall Merlin, the fund management company
which manages Pacific Horizon, had succeeded in its attempt to block the
takeover.
Jupiter Tyndall had amassed a 25.1 per cent stake in the company's warrants,
and used this to block an earlier offer. Martin Currie Pacific's directors
said in a statement yesterday that Jupiter Tyndall 'placed an interpretation
on the rights of the warrants which conflicted with that of the board of
Martin Currie Pacific and its legal advisers'.
The statement went on to say that if the offers had been made unconditional,
the board believed Jupiter Tyndall would then have issued legal proceedings.
This situation would not have been in the interests of its shareholders,
according to Martin Currie.
However, Martin Currie made it clear that it was reserving its position and
waiting to see the new proposals which Jupiter Tyndall has promised in the
near future.

FT  18 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Mercury Comms rings up 34% rise to Pounds
155m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A STRONG performance from Mercury Communications boosted the year-end
results of Cable and Wireless.
The subsidiary increased trading profit by 34 per cent to Pounds 155m
(Pounds 116m) in the 12 months to March 31, on increased sales of Pounds
915m (Pounds 702m). Group pre-tax profit rose to Pounds 644m (Pounds 609m).
Lord Young, chairman, said Oftel, the telecommunications regulator, had done
a 'smashing job' in proposing that BT cut the average level of its prices by
7.5 percentage points below the rate of inflation, against 6.25 points at
present.
'This is as good as we could have hoped for,' he said. 'It will prevent BT
from putting up their domestic prices where they have no real competition.'
Mercury is committed to increasing the number of residential customers from
200,000 to 2m by the year 2000. In total it has 781,000 lines.
It is also restructuring its sales and network management to work closely
with cable TV operators.
Margins in 1991 rose in spite of a 10 per cent cut in international prices.
The company's share of the UK international market increased from 14 to 18
per cent. Mercury has now captured 31 per cent of international calls to
Japan and 32 per cent to Switzerland.
From next January a BT-style pricing regime will affect group operations in
Hong Kong.
Its 58.4 per cent-owned HongKong Telecom has agreed to a one-off 8 per cent
reduction in international charges in the first year, followed by a 2 per
cent cut in each of the next two years.
The rules allow the subsidiary to increase domestic charges by inflation
minus 4 per cent. With inflation running at 10 per cent prices are likely to
continue to rise.
Lord Young dismissed the threat of competition - due in the 2006. Its local
services are free and the group charges residential customers monthly rental
of just Pounds 5.
HongKong Telecom increased trading profit by 28 per cent to Pounds 475m
(Pounds 370m) on sales of Pounds 1.37bn (Pounds 1.1bn).
Its international traffic rose by 15 per cent, while traffic between Hong
Kong and South China increased by 35 per cent.
Group trading profit increased by 27 per cent to Pounds 727m (Pounds 572m).
Lord Young said growth in the current half would prove even better.

FT  18 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Acquisition and rights planned to transform
Finlan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FINLAN GROUP, the property and building materials company where the 10p and
1p shares were suspended at 2 3/4 p and 3p respectively in May, yesterday
announced the acquisition of a private company, a rights issue, a
reorganisation of its capital structure and a change of name.
It has conditionally agreed to acquire and assume the name of Birkby, the
Huddersfield-based rental group, for Pounds 4.05m, to be raised via the
issue of 4.05m new ordinary 5p shares.
Mr Kim Taylor-Smith, finance director of the old Finlan and the new Birkby,
said the name change was appropriate because the reorganisation of Finlan -
begun last November and in which the banks gained half the equity - had
disposed of its debts and virtually all of its property interests, leaving
the company almost a shell.
Birkby provides managed workspace, especially in the M62 corridor,
commercial vehicle hire and instalment credit. It is forecast to make
pre-tax profits of at least Pounds 600,000 in the year to July 31 and has
'good quality earnings', Mr Taylor-Smith said.
Finlan is to raise about Pounds 6m net of expenses in the rights issue of up
to 6.73m new ordinary 5p shares. Mr Taylor-Smith said the proceeds would be
used to reduce borrowings, including the repayment of Pounds 425,000 to
FennoScandia Bank, and provide working capital. At 100p each seven new
shares will be offered for every three held and one for every Pounds 3.43
nominal of loan stock, following the capital reorganisation.
Finlan is to create a new class of 5p shares to replace the 1p ordinary, the
10p ordinary and the preference shares. It will cancel the nominal value of
the deferred shares - about Pounds 14m - and release about Pounds 14.6m
standing to the credit of the share premium account.
This Pounds 28.6m will go to a new and separate reserve, against which
Finlan will write off the accumulated deficit of about Pounds 26m on the
profit and loss account.

FT  18 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Legal row threatens Cabra's Fulham deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A LEGAL row has broken out between Fulham Football Club and Cabra Estates,
the heavily-indebted property company which owns Craven Cottage, Fulham's
ground.
The argument could scupper a January 1990 agreement between the two sides
for Fulham to be paid to leave its ground early so Cabra could re-develop
the site as residential housing.
In turn, a separate agreement under which Cabra was to sell another west
London football ground, Stamford Bridge, to its incumbent, Chelsea Football
Club, is also at risk.
Fulham had planned to ground-share with Chelsea, while Chelsea would have
used the money raised to help meet the Pounds 22.85m price tag for Stamford
Bridge.
Successful completion of the two deals is seen as central to Cabra's plans
to reduce its net debt, which stood at Pounds 52m at the end of March.
Fulham and several of its directors, including Mr Jimmy Hill, the TV
presenter, went to the High Court yesterday to seek a declaration that they
are no longer bound by a clause in the 1990 agreement.
Under the agreement, the directors said they would not provide any evidence
which could help Hammersmith and Fulham council. In a separate action the
council has blocked Cabra's re-development plans.
Fulham alleged that only one of the agreed payments from Cabra has been
made; security for other payments has not been provided; and Cabra's
financial position has deteriorated.
The directors therefore claimed it is now in the best interests of Fulham
for 'relevant evidence' to be given to a public inquiry, now underway, which
is hearing Cabra's appeal against Hammersmith and Fulham's rejection.
The inquiry, which is due to end shortly, has heard from Savills, Cabra's
property agent, that the redevelopment project would lose money, even if
house prices rose substantially.
Fulham Supporters Club, which gave evidence on Tuesday, claimed that Cabra's
failure to secure financial guarantees to cover two future payments due to
Fulham have incurred penalties which are mounting at Pounds 10,000 a day.
Cabra's accrued penalties owing to Fulham now exceed Pounds 5m, a spokesman
for the Supporters' Club claimed.
The high court hearing and the inquiry continue.

FT  18 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Kenwood flotation price set at 285p
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
KENWOOD APPLIANCES, the kitchen equipment maker, will go on sale to the
public at 285p a share next week, valuing the management buy-out from Thorn
EMI at Pounds 104.5m.
Half the 23.2m shares for sale were placed yesterday with a range of
institutions.
The price puts a 15.1 multiple on historical earnings on a pro-forma basis -
that is adjusting for what Kenwood would have made in the year to March 1992
had it enjoyed the proceeds of the share sales throughout the year. The
notional net dividend yield is 3.5 per cent.
Kenwood will raise about Pounds 39.5m after offering for sale a
higher-than-expected 63.3 per cent of the enlarged capi-tal.
Thorn-EMI, which sold Kenwood to a management buy-out in 1989, will retain a
3 per cent stake which it cannot sell in 1992 while the MBO team is
prevented from selling within the next year.
Candover Investments, the venture capital supplier, will retain an 18 per
cent stake.
Mr Timothy Parker, chief executive, said Kenwood would continue to grow
through introduction of new products but that last year's 40 per cent growth
in operating profit would not be repeated.
In addition to repaying all Pounds 33.4m of bank debt, the listing would
allow Kenwood greater flexibility to expand either through acquisition or
capital investment and would reduce the likelihood of constraints on future
product development.
Brokers to the offers are Rowe &amp; Pitman while the flotation has been
sponsored by Schroders.
COMMENT
It was perhaps unfortunate that Kenwood should price its flotation just as
Philips warned that profits would be hit by poor consumer spending. A 285p
flotation price is also somewhat expensive, putting the company's
prospective earnings on a premium to the market as a whole. Kenwood does,
however, have a lot going for it and should continue to attract
institutional interest after the placing. Operating profits, despite the
recession hitting Philips and others, have grown rapidly through
introduction of new products and it has strong non-UK sales, unlike Pifco,
another kitchen product competitor. But according to brokers James Capel,
its strongest asset is the Kenwood brand, a name that was selling food
mixers when most of the subscribing public were not even born. Another
factor supporting yesterday's pricing is the 18 per cent stake that Candover
Investments retains in the company. The venture capital group will be slowly
reducing that stake and will have been keen to see an orderly and upward
price movement in the after market. While Kenwood is a growth company, it is
by no means hi-tech and will not maintain last year's phenomenal growth. But
for longer term investors, or those simply attracted by owning a name on
their kitchen counters, the pricing is attractive.

FT  18 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Italians invest in white goods unit of
Polly Peck
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ADMINISTRATORS of Polly Peck International, have agreed a deal under
which Merloni Elettrodomestici, the Italian white goods group best known for
its Ariston brand, has bought 25 per cent of two Turkish white goods
producers owned by Vestel, the Turkish consumer electronics subsidiary of
the collapsed fruit and electronics conglomerate.
Separately, Candy, another leading Italian manufacturer, has signed a L70bn
(Pounds 31.8m) deal with the Libyan government to build and equip a plant to
produce 50,000 refrigerators within the next two years.
The Merloni deal, being conducted jointly with Philco Italia, in which
Merloni has a 50 per cent stake, includes an option to buy a further minimum
26 per cent share in the two Turkish companies within the next two years.
Merloni is paying Dollars 8m (Pounds 4.3m) with a further Dollars 9.5m if it
exercises its option.
It is also injecting Dollars 8m in capital into the two companies, which
were set up recently.
Coopers &amp; Lybrand Deloitte, Polly Peck's administrator, said the sale was
unlikely to provide any funds for the Pounds 1.3bn owed to the 23,000
creditors.
The two Turkish groups are called Pekel Teknik and Pekel Pazarlama. They
have 750 employees and make fridges and washing machines respectively.
Combined output amounted to about 200,000 units last year, and is forecast
to rise to 300,000 this year, two-thirds of it fridges.

CODIC, the Belgian property subsidiary of the Dixons electrical retailing
group, has refinanced its Beaulieu office development in Brussels with a
group of international banks, valuing the site at Pounds 93.3m.
But the transaction will not be reflected in Dixons profit and loss account
due to expected changes in accounting standards practices.
The refinancing, via a new company, Espace Beaulieu, guarantees Codic a
minimum level of profit and removes the risk of holding the property in an
uncertain market. But, following the recommendations of the proposed
Statement of Standard Accounting Practice ED 49, Dixons will treat Espace
Beaulieu as a consolidated subsidiary company.
'The reality is that we have transferred the risk and have effectively made
a sale, but for projected accounting reasons we have been unable it to
register it as a sale,' Mr Robert Shrager, Dixons finance director, said
yesterday. 'It will have no immediate effect on the profit and loss account
until Espace Beaulieu sells it to a third party when the profit can be
recognised.'
The refinancing was arranged by Citibank, with ASLK-CGER Bank acting as the
senior lead manager.

FT  18 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Placing at 130p values Country Casuals at
Pounds 22m
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
SHARES in Country Casuals, the women's clothing retailer and designer, were
yesterday placed with a variety of institutions at a price of 130p, valuing
the company at Pounds 22.2m, writes Richard Gourlay.
The shares will begin trading on June 25, but there is no public offering
for sale.
The price represented 15.9 times pro-forma earnings for the year to January.
Some 8.3m of the 17.1m shares in issue were placed.
The management team, led by Mr John Shannon, chairman, will be left with
32.5 per cent of the enlarged capital, while Invesco MIM, will retain a 14.4
per cent stake.
Mr Shannon said he saw the flotation of Country Casuals as 'a beginning' not
the end of the process begun in 1989 when Coats Viyella sold the company to
his management buy-in team.
He expected growth to come from continued expansion of the Country Casuals
brand through more retail outlets and through the introduction of its
Diffusion Sport casual wear.
The company was in no hurry to expand through acquisition, but it intended
to apply the same management techniques that revived Country Casuals to
another brand which it would buy in the medium term.
Country Casuals designs and sells tailored and knitted separates for the
Pounds 7bn a year outerwear ladies market.
Last year pre-tax profits were Pounds 2m on sales of Pounds 36m. Having
started with debt of Pounds 10.5m, the company had positive net cash at the
last year-end. Since the buy-in, trading margins have increased from 4.4 per
ent to 6.1 per cent.
The company will be receiving Pounds 4.6m after expenses from the shares
sale.

FT  18 JUN 92 / NFC says recession may be ending
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JAMES WATSON, chairman of NFC, the transport and distribution business,
yesterday said there were signs that the UK recession was coming to an end.
In spite of reporting unchanged pre-tax profits of Pounds 39.5m for the half
year ending April 18, Mr Watson said he was encouraged by a sustained
improvement in the truck rental market.
Mr Watson said: 'We have seen signs of recovery in the past which have not
lasted, although the present signs of an uplift appear to be more sustained
than before. Nonetheless, growth is likely to be slow.'
NFC's traditional transport division reported a fall in operating profits
from Pounds 14.4m to Pounds 12.8m. In the second quarter, however, it
reported Pounds 7.5m profits, just Pounds 100,000 down on the comparable
figure.
At the end of the August the group has the option of taking another 650
vehicles increasing its fleet of trucks from 1,500 to 2,200.
The group confirmed its 'best view' of pre-tax profits for the year-end in
the range of Pounds 90m to Pounds 100m. Half-year sales were Pounds 879m, up
from Pounds 831m.
Logistics, which provides transportation and warehousing facilities for
goods sent from manufacturers to distributors, increased profits by 15 per
cent to Pounds 22.4m.
One of the ways NFC is expanding Logistics is by following its clients into
different countries. For example, when Marks and Spencer opened shops in
Spain, it asked NFC to establish a distribution centre there.
Operating profits from Hyperion's property division were Pounds 2.9m
compared with Pounds 3.1m.
NFC is looking for a buyer for its Pickfords retail travel business. Mr
Watson said: 'We are having a close conversation with someone at the
moment.'
The group expanded its international business with acquisitions in Europe
and the US. Mr Watson said he was confident more than half the group's
profits would come from operations outside the UK by 1995. Overseas profits
now account for 35 per cent of the group's operating profits.
Interest costs were Pounds 200,000 down at Pounds 4.6m, as gearing was
reduced to 32 per cent from 45 per cent at the first quarter-end.
Earnings per share remained unchanged at 5.7p. A second interim dividend of
1.4p makes a total of 2.7p for the year so far compared with 2.5p.

FT  18 JUN 92 / Profit forecasts deal further blow to Japanese investors:
The ebbing confidence in the Tokyo market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEFAN WAGSTYL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Among the many blows raining down on investors in the Tokyo stock market
this week, the heaviest have been warnings about the grim outlook for
corporate profits.
Gloomy forecasts published this week by leading securities groups have
helped to squeeze the last drops of confidence out of the market.
Yesterday, the Nikkei index fell 507.73 to 16,445.8, setting a new low for
the fall in stock prices which began in 1990.
Ten top brokers' research centres predicted pre-tax profits of large
Japanese companies would fall in the current financial year which ends in
March 1993 - it would be the first time since the Second World War that
profits have fallen three years in a row.
The brokers forecast an average decline of 9.9 per cent for all industries
and of 12.9 per cent for manufacturing companies, which are more exposed to
swings in the business cycle.
Nomura Securities, the largest brokerage, predicted falls of 12.1 per cent
and 15.5 per cent.
The forecasts contrast sharply with corporations' own forecasts of declines
averaging around 5 per cent, except for financial groups.
Until a few months ago, many companies accepted the government's forecast of
3.5 per cent economic growth in the year to March 1993 and based their
profits predictions on this figure. But there are growing doubts in Tokyo
that the economy will actually grow at this speed.
The stockbroking companies this week put themselves firmly in the
pessimists' camp. For example, Nomura's profits forecasts are based on the
assumption that growth will only reach 2 per cent this financial year and
will recover only slowly to 2.8 per cent next year.
Profits are being squeezed by this slowdown in the economy, as companies'
incomes fall faster than costs, in spite of intense efforts to trim
spending, run down inventories and reduce capital spending.
Groups are cutting recruitment but cannot sack existing staff, except as a
last resort. Companies also face increased depreciation charges from the
huge investments made in the boom of the late 1980s, which totalled around
Y400,000bn (Pounds 1,700bn) for the economy as a whole.
Furthermore, borrowing costs for listed companies will rise as around
Y15,000bn of equity-linked bond issues fall due by March 1994.
Banks, seeking to boost their own profits, will attempt to extract better
margins from borrowers.
Smithers, a British securities research boutique, estimates that every 0.1
percentage point increase in borrowing costs reduces corporate pre-tax
profits by 2 per cent.
Finally, companies face further losses from the financial investments made
in the speculative boom of the 1980s.
For some groups, notably Sharp, the electronics group, financial revenues
account for more than half of total profits. Even conservatively managed
groups which put their funds into safe cash deposits face falling income as
interest rates have fallen from their peak in 1990.
A recovery in profits will depend crucially on a recovery in the economy.
Even the government's Economic Planning Agency this week admitted it would
be 'difficult but not impossible' to meet the official target of 3.5 per
cent growth for the current year.
Private sector economists even believe the forecast could be cut if more
evidence of weakness in the economy emerges. But the EPA still believes that
a recovery will come in the autumn.
However, a slow recovery would mean a very weak rebound in profits. Nomura
believes that profits in 1993-94 may rise only 9.6 per cent for leading
non-financial companies. Yamaichi Securities foresees an increase of just
11.6 per cent.
These figures will bring little joy to stock market investors. In spite of
the near-60 per cent fall in the Nikkei index from its all-time high,
Japanese stocks are not cheap.
Stocks in the First Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange trade at around 40
times prospective earnings for 1992-93. That is well below the peak of 70
recorded in the late 1980s but is still near the top of the 20-to-40 range
of the early 1980s. The implication is that investors still hope for a
faster recovery in profits than the brokers are forecasting. They might
possibly be right.
The government and the Bank of Japan might act to boost the economy through
increased public spending and further cuts in interest rates. Construction
and interest-rate sensitive stocks might respond and lift the whole stock
market.
Economic policymakers at the Bank of Japan and the Ministry of Finance have
repeatedly said that executives' and investors' sentiment is worse than
economic reality. If so, then sentiment could turn sharply once executives
and investors realise that they are wrong.
But there is precious little evidence this week of an imminent change of
heart.

FT  18 JUN 92 / Philips share price falls 17% on results warning
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RONALD VAN DE KROL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   AMSTERDAM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES in Philips, the Dutch electronics group, plunged more than 17 per
cent on the Amsterdam Stock Exchange yesterday after the company warned that
problems in consumer electronics would lead to a substantial drop in
second-quarter results and might cause full-year profits to fall below 1991
levels.
Philips blamed the downturn on the depressed state of the recession-hit
consumer electronics market, which accounts for almost half the company's
annual turnover of Fl 57bn (Pounds 17.3bn).
'While we are maintaining market share in our consumer electronics and
components divisions, price erosion and under-utilisation of capacity have
caused lower than anticipated results,' the company said.
Philips, which appeared to be making progress in bolstering flagging
profitability, said its other main businesses such as lighting and
professional products were performing better than forecast. But these
improvements could not compensate for the disappointing trend in consumer
electronics.
Although it has been clear that Philips and its Japanese competitors faced
difficulties in consumer electronics, the Dutch company's profit warning
took the stock market by surprise. Philips's shares dropped 17.6 per cent to
end the day at Fl 31.30 compared with Tuesday's close of Fl 38.00.
The company is scheduled to release second-quarter figures on August 6. When
it published first-quarter figures last month, Philips said its consumer
electronics business had swung into an operating loss of 'less than Fl 100m'
from profits of around Fl 100m the year before, reflecting a 5 per cent
decline in selling prices.
The company said the crisis in consumer electronics had deepened during the
second quarter.
'Should the present trend in this market segment continue in the second half
of 1992, it is unlikely that a net profit from normal business operations
equal to that of 1991 will be realised,' the company said.
In 1991, Philips posted net profit before extraordinary items of Fl 981m, a
reversal of the previous year when it suffered a loss of Fl 4.5bn, mainly
because of extensive restructuring provisions. It had forecast a 'limited
increase' in 1992 net profit from normal business operations.

FT  18 JUN 92 / Economic Viewpoint: The phoenix that did not arise from NEDC
ashes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SAMUEL BRITTAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is easier to destroy than to build.' This is the sort of Churchillianism
that comes to mind when I hear of the government's decision to abolish the
National Economic Development Council. So anyone expecting me to cheer from
the rafters will be disappointed.
NEDC consists of a council of ministers, business representatives, trade
unionists and a few independents. It was meant to discuss economic strategy.
The main work, however, was carried out by an independent office, which also
serviced the 'Little Neddies' for specific industries.
When the body was established by Harold Macmillan in 1962, French-style
indicative planning was much in vogue. Not long afterwards it went out of
fashion in France itself. The idea of ministers and the 'two sides of
industry' fixing things around a table went out of fashion much later,
basically with the failure of the 'social contract' of the 1974-1979 Labour
government. Nevertheless there was still a useful role for the organisation.
The National Economic Development Office's director-general, Walter Eltis,
has just pointed out that in the 1980s the organisation shifted from grand
macroeconomic strategy to what he calls 'supply-siding improvements' in
specific industries.
But there was an important macroeconomic element in NEDC in the early days.
This was to press the Treasury and the Bank of England to boost demand
sufficiently to secure an annual growth rate of 4 per cent. The Treasury dug
in and said that 3 per cent was the maximum feasible.
The emotion which that debate engendered was comparable with that which
occurred later over 'shadowing' the D-Mark or joining the ERM. Charges flew
back and forth and friendships were broken. This might all now seem to
belong to another world. Few economists or economic commentators would argue
with a straight face that government financial policies can determine
whether the economy will grow on average by 4 or 3 per cent, or any other
figure. Government intervention should be limited to improving the
efficiency with which markets work.
And yet there is a baby with the bath water. NEDC was set up in part to form
a lobby for economic growth and efficiency. There are not that many other
bodies committed to growth. Government departments have their own clientele
with their own vested interests. That applies even to the Treasury. Its goal
of holding back public spending may do more to help growth than spending
ministers think; but the two goals are not identical.
A short-lived experiment with an independent economic voice in government
was the Department of Economic Affairs under the first Wilson government.
There have also been departments attached to the prime minister or the
Cabinet Office, such as Lord Rothschild's Central Policy Review Staff and
the Number 10 Policy Unit now under Sarah Hogg. Although many of their
members genuinely believe in growth, their first task is to serve the prime
minister of the day.
Ministers sometimes ask why independent forecasting centres like the
National Institute or the London Business School cannot do the job. They
forget that forecasting - of which they claim to be sceptical - is not the
same as either lobbying for growth-centred policies or carrying out research
into the obstacles to growth, research which often suggests making more use
of markets and prices.
As for the tripartite council: I have no doubt that ministers found it a
boring talking shop. The frequency of council meetings had already been
reduced in 1987. But there is still something to be said for keeping a
permanent channel of communication between a Conservative government and
trade unionists, and one that is not dependent on ministers saying: 'They
can always ring up my office if they want to see me.'
The best bet now for a source of advice and influence not bound by the
cabinet line is an independent Bank of England. Whatever happens to the
Maastricht Treaty, the momentum to increased collaboration among the
Community central bankers - now under a Danish chairman - will continue to
build up. The Bank of England will only be able to play its full part if it
is independent but accountable.
But I am not sure that a central bank completely meets the bill. My own
preferred evolution of the Office part of NEDO would have been towards a
US-style Council of Economic Advisers - at a slightly greater distance from
government than is the case in America. Papers from an outside source in the
chancellor's box would at least be a reminder of the variety of points of
view.
Ministers need to be reminded that, if you interpret growth as the growth of
cash spending (nominal GDP), then it is not so absurd to put forward a
growth target of 3 or 4 per cent per annum. This is low enough to put a lid
on inflation but high enough to ensure that, if pay and prices are
restrained, the results will not go to waste in loss of output, income and
employment. (In the jargon there is a role for a nominal demand objective.)
Indeed that is what monetarism is all about when shorn of the mystification
and technicalities. It is also consistent with reconstructed Keynesianism.
Some organisation may well be needed to press for some minimal demand growth
even if that has to be promoted internationally - say at the level of the
European Community or the Group of Seven.
Such an objective will be particularly important if the economic challenge
changes from one of inflation to one of deflation. If that occurs, it will
not arrive neatly, with headline consumer price changes falling gradually to
zero and then below. It has already been seen in commodity prices - where
the fall has now levelled off - and in property prices, where the drop is
still continuing.
The Bank for International Settlements remarks in its annual report: 'Real
estate price deflation, if that is what it should be called, might be
considered to be a new phenomenon in the postwar economic history of the
industrial countries . . . If not contained, it could not only have further
repercussions on financial institutions in the countries concerned but also
affect the prospects for full economic recovery.'
Argument is likely to continue on whether declines in asset prices, when
ordinary consumer prices are still rising, constitute deflation or not.
Nearly all the great deflations with which we have been threatened since the
second world war have been false alarms and only provided excuses for
allowing inflation to regain momentum.
Now, almost for the first time, it is worth looking out for a possible need
to switch the direction of economic policy from the threat of rising prices
to one of slump and falling prices. It would, however, be typically British
to disband a potential pro-growth body when there is just a chance that
there may be a need for it.

FT  18 JUN 92 / Letter: Business in the Community should get back to its
roots
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr JOHN EVERSLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Charles Batchelor reported ('Shake-up in business support', June 3)
that Business in the Community, the umbrella organisation for Britain's
300-plus Local Enterprise Agencies, plans to reduce its direct involvement
in the affairs of the agencies. He goes on to quote David Grayson, BITC
managing director, as saying 'We are not walking away from the enterprise
agencies'.
As a recently retired general manager of one of these local enterprise
agencies (after nearly 10 years work in the field), I beg to differ. BITC
was set up as an initiative to assist local economic regeneration in the
aftermath of the Toxteth riots to enable local and national private sector
firms to work with central government in taking local initiatives in areas
of high unemployment. These initiatives could embrace support for small
firms creation, support for education/industry links and a variety of other
community based support activities.
Where BITC scored was in representing the agencies to government, in
lobbying to initiate local mobilisation of private sector involvement and
persuading British industry to give priority to community involvement as a
means of addressing some of the social, economic and structural problems of
the inner city and development areas.
BITC did its job well - until it started trying to be all things to all
people. It seemed, in the mid-1980s, to consider that it had a mission of
its own - to support ill-conceived environmental and urban renewal schemes,
to re-invent a variety of educational link schemes, and to present itself as
the voice of industry in discussions with government on training for the
unemployed and the establishment of business support networks.
As a result it has not only totally lost its credibility in the eyes of LEA
managers like myself - but also, it seems, in the eyes of government, since
BITC influence has been marginalised over the past four years. Instead of
groping for a role which, one suspects, its industrial sponsors do not
envisage, BITC should revert to its original role.
Perhaps the failure of BITC has something to do with its staffing and
management at the centre. So many of the senior people seem to be involved
in other 'causes': in political lobbying and in supporting BITC's president,
instead of trying to provide a relevant service to its grass roots base.
It would not surprise me if the recent antics of BITC have so alienated
local and central government that there is no hope of any concerted action
in the areas described above.

Sir, A thief stole some jewellery, took it to a pawnbroker and used it as

It is difficult to imagine that the law would find that the jewels belonged

What is the difference between the pawnbroker and the banks which are laying

<TEXT>
Sir, You report Shirayama's threat to pull out of developing County Hall
unless the government clarifies its position ('County Hall buyer threatens
to pull out', June 15).
Far from being a blow to the government if Shirayama were to withdraw, it
would be a great fillip to London and a credit to the govern-ment if Mr John
Major were to direct that the London Residuary Body could sell the site for
a nominal amount to the London School of Economics in recognition of the
benefits such a use could bring to the city.
That this great building should be required for institutional use was
anticipated by the LRB and Shirayama which have not 'paid' Pounds 60m but by
all accounts have entered into an arrangement giving both parties the option
to withdraw.
It would probably help a depressed property market if Shirayama were given a
way out of a development whose financing in better times has already
defeated more experienced operators.

FT  18 JUN 92 / Letter: Assurances and the British Gas prospectus
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr JONATHAN P STERN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your leader 'Time to review the regulators' (June 10) asks whether the
latter are 'tearing up the prospectuses published when the utilities were
privatised'. In the case of British Gas my answer would be yes. This
observation does not relate to the much publicised raising of the X factor
in the price formula but rather to the proposal by the Office of Fair
Trading, subsequently adopted by the government, to reduce the tariff
threshold from 25,000 therms to 2,500 therms (with a view to phasing it out
entirely).
The company's prospectus clearly stated that the authorisation to act as a
public gas supplier conferred upon the company a monopoly of its present
customers consuming up to 25,000 therms per annum for a minimum period of 25
years unless BG failed to comply with enforcement orders made by Ofgas or
the secretary of state for trade and industry. The OFT report stated that BG
had complied with all undertakings given to all regulatory bodies but that
it considered further remedies were required if competition is to develop.
While not necessarily disagreeing with the OFT conclusion, this action has
raised further important questions. For shareholders there must be an issue
of whether assurances given in privatisation prospectuses are of any value
after the dust has settled from the flotation and the government has taken
its revenue. For gas consumers the reduction (and potential elimination) of
the tariff threshold should give pause for thought. At the time of
privatisation, a monopoly was conferred on BG in return for certain
obligations towards this class of consumers. Removal of that monopoly places
a question mark over the status of the company's obligations. This is not
necessarily alarming, but their consequences demand more public attention
than they have received thus far.

Sir, City economists feel deprived because of their lack of access to the
aggregated sales figures of retailers which are submitted in confidence to

the official retail sales statistics are, and have been for some time,
misleading.
Rather than plead for privileged information, City economists should join
those who for many years have appealed for the provision of better-quality
official statistics.

The Conservatives may still not be the most popular party in Scotland but
there is little doubt that in dealing with the media during the election
they were the nicest and best equipped of the Scottish political parties.
All credit to their 32-year-old chief press officer, Alice Luce. She was
promoted to the post only three weeks before polling when her predecessor
Brian Townsend suddenly resigned. So it seems somewhat crass of her bosses
to sack her along with five others in post-electoral cost-cutting at head
office.
In the macho style of City of London firings, the normally diplomatic party
chairman Lord Sanderson ordered her to clear her desk and leave the building
at once. Then he replaced her with his personal assistant, David Watt.
Luce, who had worked for the party for four years, feels badly let down,
especially as - for the first time in Scottish Tory general election
campaigns since 1979 - this year's ended with the party increasing both its
vote and its number of seats. The party's 'commitment to employing women in
high places seems rather hollow,' she says.
Lady Thatcher would doubtless agree.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
'Everyone is entitled to one mistake,' says Sir Peter Cazalet, APV's
well-connected chairman. Nevertheless, a few eyebrows will cock at the speed
with which Clive Strowger, the ex-chief executive of Mountleigh, has found a
comfortable new berth as APV's chief executive.
APV has been looking for a new chief executive for quite some time - which,
coupled with the fact that Strowger has been out of a job since September,
suggests he could hardly have been a first-choice appointment.
Be that as it may, Cazalet - an ex-BP man who sits on the boards of P &amp; O
and Wellcome - has taken extensive soundings and is confident he has made
the right selection. Strowger, a respected ex-finance director of GrandMet,
has the sort of international experience APV needs if it is to integrate its
collection of businesses and avoid being taken over.
Strowger is certainly not a maverick and is understood to have been stung by
last year's Stock Exchange criticism of Mountleigh's directors, especially
since he used to be a member of the exchange's quotations committee. Perhaps
he has been harshly treated.
Even so, his decision to throw in his lot with US entrepreneurs Nelson Peltz
and Peter May in some half-baked idea of transforming a controversial
property company like Mountleigh into a proper international business,
wasn't just bad luck.
It was a monumental error of judgment.

Could it be that the best way to get the public to turn down a historic
proposal is to make it a long one, and get them to read it? Certain Danes,
reflecting on the rejection of the Maastricht Treaty, are beginning to think
so.
Well before the June 2 referendum their government printed the 120-page
legal text and handed out 500,000 free copies, one for every 10 of the
population. The result, it seems, was that a good many of them took one look
and decided they could never vote for anything so incomprehensible.
What price, then, the chances for the Norwegian government? Its bill
presenting the European Economic Area Agreement between the European
Community and the Efta countries, just issued, runs to 4,707 pages and
weighs in at 16lb 1 1/2 oz.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The jibe 'No sex, please: we're British' may look to be confirmed by the
Automobile Association's survey which shows that the Brits are no longer
seduced by sexy car ads. They're now far more turned on by things like
mechanical reliability and good all-round vision.
But lust hasn't entirely lost its commercial pull - or so hopes lutenist
Anthony Rooley, at least, who is pressing it into service in launching a
record label specialising in early music.
Having set up the Consort of Musicke 23 years ago, he is seeking backers
under the tax-relieving Business Expansion Scheme for a new record-producing
company with the self-effacing name of Musica Oscura. It should nevertheless
stand out clearly among most of the other ventures formed under the scheme,
which is due for to be scrapped at the end of next year because it had
largely degenerated into a tax-break for private landlords.
The Pounds 350,000 the company hopes to raise will go towards 10 new discs
of works by composers such as Cipriano De Rore and Luca Marenzio. But while
their names seem unlikely to draw the millions, Musica Oscura is certainly
doing all it can to breathe fire into their compositions. Take for instance
its sleeve notes for the disc featuring Marenzio, which proclaim:
'Only classical Indian music, with its lascivious drones and ululating
melodies, can rival the renaissance madrigal in creating wanton bliss. Luca
Marenzio is one of the recognised gurus of this sensual art-form, perhaps
the greatest - from the lofty Petrarchan conceit addressed to the ineffable
and unattainable Laura to the highly erotic world of post Guarini love
poetry. . . .'
Not to mention 40 per cent tax relief, to boot.

FT  18 JUN 92 / Leading Article: EC anti-trust
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
IT IS IRONIC, given Sir Leon Brittan's firm stewardship of EC competition
policy, that the European Commission's fitness to exercise power in this
field is increasingly questioned. That, however, is as much a tribute to Sir
Leon's success in placing competition policy higher on the EC agenda as it
is a symptom of unease at the commission's sometimes haphazard record in
enforcing it.
The need for effective EC-wide competition safeguards in a single market is
indisputable and has been explicitly recognised with the passage of the EC
merger regulation. However, the procedures for achieving this goal are
flawed. Not only do they lack clarity; but in a community where the biggest
threats to free markets are often the actions of governments rather than of
companies, they are too prone to political manipulation.
This week, Sir Sydney Lipworth, chairman of the UK Monopolies and Mergers
Commission urged that at least some of the EC commission's powers be
transferred to an independent authority. Sir Leon has rejected such demands
in the past, asserting that any alternative to the present system would be
at least as vulnerable to political interference. But while there may be
some truth in his argument, it ignores two important points raised by Sir
Sydney
One is that by acting as investigator, prosecutor, judge and executioner,
the commission risks conflicts of interest by combining too many
incompatible roles. Sir Sydney proposes giving responsibility for
investigation and adjudication to a body independent of the commission, or
at least of its prosecuting arm. Secondly, such a body should routinely
publish its detailed findings. That would inject much-needed transparency
into a system which currently imposes no onus on Brussels to justify
competition decisions.
These proposals would favour fairer and more consistent decision-making,
though they would not of themselves safeguard against political meddling.
There is room for debate on how that could best be achieved. But for
Brussels to persist in denying any need for reform would be both myopic and
contrary to the principles of efficient and equitable policy which Sir Leon
has sought energetically to uphold.

FT  18 JUN 92 / Leading Article: Fewer nukes
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
BY THE standards of the Cold war, Tuesday's Russo-American agreement to cut
nuclear arsenals to fewer than 3,500 warheads apiece would be a truly
amazing item of good news. Even today it is good news, but those standards
no longer apply. Indeed, one of its salutary effects may be to remind world
public opinion that both superpowers still possess very large stocks of
nuclear weapons, which would take them well over a decade to destroy.
Few people in the west any longer see Russian nuclear weapons as the
instrument of a hostile power's quest for world domination. Therefore,
western preoccupations are less concerned with the quantitative destructive
potential of Russia's nuclear strike force than with the degree to which it
is under effective political control and physically secure. The west has
eagerly, almost indecently, hastened to recognise Russia as the sole legal
successor of the defunct Soviet Union, mainly out of anxiety to avoid the
multiplication of nuclear powers by a process of vegetative reproduction.
The fiction that the former Soviet strategic forces devolved not to Russia
as such but to the Commonwealth of Independent States has now been
abandoned. But the precise relationship between the Russian state and those
elements of the ex-Soviet armed forces - both conventional and nuclear -
which remain in being outside Russian territory remains unclear.
The difficulties involved in 'repatriating' both troops and weapons to
Russian soil, in demobilising the former and in decommissioning the latter,
are at once economic, technical and political. The implementation of arms
control agreements - notably CFE and Start - signed by the Soviet Union but
not yet ratified by its successor states, is problematic, and dependent even
in the best of cases on western help. Mr Vadim Osinin, an arms control
expert attached to the Russian parliamentary defence committee, spoke
yesterday of 'difficulties with implementing the Start treaty obligations,
which will go on until 1999'; and said that implementation of the new
agreement could not begin until that of Start was complete.
In those circumstances it is probably best to regard this agreement as at
once an earnest of Mr Boris Yeltsin's goodwill (conditioned, in part at
least, by his desperate need for western economic aid), and as a test of his
control over the ex-Soviet armed forces. It will not be fully implemented
until the year 2003, or at best 2000. But it is a very important measure of
nuclear disarmament by the two largest nuclear powers, in accordance with
the letter and the spirit of Article VI of the Non-Proliferation Treaty. As
such it should facilitate the extension of that treaty in 1995. At the same
time it brings the US and Russian arsenals down to a level where they can
reasonably require that the next round of disarmament talks should involve
the other nuclear powers as well.

FT  18 JUN 92 / Leading Article: Partial eclipse darkens Japan
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CURRENT eclipse of Japan's economic sun will not last for ever. But
there are more constructive ways for the Japanese authorities to remove the
shadow than simply to sit, wait and pray to the gods. The Bank of Japan and
the Ministry of Finance together have the power to stimulate domestic
demand. Both economic and political logic suggest they use it.
The Bank of Japan's unwillingness to acknowledge the risks the economy faces
is understandable, if misguided. Most economies would have buckled under the
combined strain of a harsh monetary tightening and financial market
collapse. But the bank has so far skilfully managed to deflate Japan's
frighteningly large asset market bubble without prompting anything more than
a modest deceleration of economic growth. Not even the most pessimistic
observers expect Japan to suffer a fall in output, let alone a recession on
the scale suffered by the US or UK. More likely Japanese economic growth
will slip to a respectable 2 per cent this year.
What then, the central bank and finance ministry might ask, is all the fuss
about? But Japan's policy-makers cannot afford to be so sanguine. The risk
Japan faces is not a sharp fall in output but instead that the return to
trend economic growth will take years rather than months. For a sign of
things to come, officials have only to observe the anaemic recovery in
America and the corpse-like state of the UK economy, and listen to the
resigned tones of once optimistic civil servants and forecasters.
Japan is, in fact, suffering from the very same underlying problem that has
strangled economic recoveries in the Anglo-Saxon world. Companies, consumers
and banks are all burdened by varying degrees of outstanding debts. The
weakness of the stock market and the accumulation of bad debts in the
banking sector have already depressed confidence and activity outside the
financial community. Corporate profitability is weak and expected to
deteriorate; bankruptcies are rising and overtime working is falling. Broad
money growth may be sluggish because companies do not want to borrow for
investment, but even if they did the banks would be in no position to offer
new finance.
Yet Japan does not have to stand back and take these deflationary blows on
the chin. The Bank of Japan, unlike the Bank of England, retains the ability
to set a flexible course for monetary policy; and reason demands more
interest rate cuts than Mr Yoshida Mieno, its governor, has so far been
willing to deliver. The inflation risk is negligible as the low level of
long rates indicates; and a further percentage point off the discount rate
would provide welcome relief to Japan's troubled banking sector.
Similarly, the finance ministry, unlike the US Treasury, has ample room to
stimulate domestic demand through active fiscal policy. The budget balance
that counts - that of the general government - is in healthy surplus, and
the public sector, unlike the private sector, has plenty of worthwhile
investment opportunities.
The underlying strength of the Japanese economy will ensure that it
eventually resumes its place in the sun, although the heat may not be quite
as intense as in the late 1980s. But the Japanese authorities have a clear
interest in this happening sooner rather than later. The longer growth in
Japan remains slow, the more consumers will reduce their spending on imports
and the larger Japan's current account will become. A looser monetary and
fiscal policy is the sensible way to cut this deficit and smooth
international trade relations. Inaction only increases the risk that the US
or EC will try to impose a more brutal solution.

FT  18 JUN 92 / Arts: The Rise and Fall of Little Voice - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Jim Cartwright's new play at the Cottesloe opens in the dark with some
dissonant music, screams and a harsh Lancashire voice in the background.
When the lights go on, a garish-looking woman is sick in the sink. Then the
fuses blow because the electricity system in this northern English town,
1992, cannot bear the record player and the electric kettle being turned on
at the same time. There is lot of swearing and some brutality.
The Rise and Fall of Little Voice proceeds in this provocatively
disagreeable way for about 20 minutes. Yet since Cartwright is one of the
most promising English playwrights, it is worth holding on: there are
surprises to come. Little Voice has at least one startling coup de theatre
and, in this production by Sam Mendes, outstanding performances all round.
The title is Cartwright's longest so far. His previous plays were called Bed
and To in that order, but even Little Voice can be abbreviated to LV, and
usually is. LV is the daughter of the garish-looking woman, Mari Hoff. She
is called Little Voice because nobody could hear what she said as a child
or, perhaps more accurately, because she never tried to speak up.
She has been left a collector's gem of long playing records by female
vocalists by her father, Frank. Mari's main memory of Frank is how
embarrassing it was at the registry office to sign off as Mr and Mrs F Hoff,
which broadly speaking is what Mari then did.
LV not only listens to the LPs incessantly - fuses permitting; she learns
from them. The theatrical coup comes when she is overheard (not by her
mother) singing to herself. Shirley Bassey, Judy Garland, Cilla Black,
Gracie Fields, Billie Holiday, Edith Piaf, Marilyn Monroe, she can do the
lot. It may seem an odd mix, but if you see the play you will understand
why. The clue is Gracie Fields: Cartwright is a consciously north country
writer.
LV is played by Jane Horrocks. It is an immensely challenging part. Not only
does she have to go through the whole singing repertoire; she also has to
play the mixture of hurt little girl and potential star. Some of Ms
Horrocks's facial expressions are superb. In the singing role I thought that
she flagged slightly as the show went on. Given confidence and audience
support, however, this could grow into an unforgettable performance.
The play has its imperfections. There is an excess of sentimentality. The
romantic sub-plot about the equally little-voiced British Telecom engineer
who is as devoted to lasers as is LV to singing does not quite work. The
suggestion at the end that LV has risen, fallen and risen yet again under
the BT influence is at odds with the title.
The sight of the mother, drinking Alka-Seltzer from a dirty milk bottle
because it is less filthy than the cups in the sink, over-pushes the
squalor. I did not enjoy watching Alison Steadman playing this part, but I
admired her performance - and her commitment to stick to it - no end.
The minor part that comes off like a charm is George Raistrick as Mr Boo,
the slightly Asian-looking impresario who presents LV at the local club. As
John Osborne keeps reminding us, it is always useful to have a spot of music
hall.
As a play, Little Voice is not quite as good as To, which was shown at the
Young Vic 18 months ago, largely because it is less well structured. But one
has begun to look forward to whatever Cartwright comes up with and to
anything directed by Sam Mendes.

FT  18 JUN 92 / Arts: Ubu - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ST GEORGE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Alfred Jarry (1873-1907) wrote the first of his four Ubu plays in 1896. It
ran for two nights at its opening, and has been perplexing audiences ever
since. Now, the Nada Theatre has taken its Avignon Festival version of the
Ubu plays on tour: this makes anarchic, playful and life-enhancing theatre.
Jarry wrote the original for puppets. Nada use fruit &amp; veg. They tell a tale
of regicide, state ceremony, political intrigue, insurrection and war. The
cast amounts to two actors and a battalion of 'fruits et legumes': leeks,
potatoes, cabbages and celeriac. The exotica arrive in the form of 'ananas'
and 'pamplemousse'. Vegetables without stage presence (mushrooms, peas,
jerusalem artichokes) need not apply. But the cast still needs a little
purple asparagus for the regal touch.
Ubu feels like an allegory for something else; but, as befits a play adored
by the high surrealist Guillaume Apollinaire, it signifies nothing. Through
the alchemy of theatre, anything can mean anything; or as Hans Arp used to
say, 'the tongue is a chair'.
The play does provide a full platter of madness and invention. The range of
the actors (Babette Masson and Guilhem Pellegrin) beggars belief. Masson's
voice soars to become a bagpipe at a military parade and plummets to mimic
the gravelly tones of a palace guard. She controls the vegetable-puppets and
wields the vegetable-weapons. Pellegrin negotiates the wonderful miming:
including a stage horse and a final voyage out, done with some water in a
zinc bathtub. As the actors commune with the vegetables, one is gradually
implicated into the winning absurdity of the evening. Where conspirators are
cabbages, the 'noblesse' leeks, and high financiers yellow peppers; life in
the kitchen garden suddenly seems to apply everywhere. Ubu is acted in
French, and lasts a breathless and exhilarating hour.
Tour: Warwick Arts Centre (June 15-16); Manchester Green Room (June 18-20);
Glasgow Tramway (June 22-24): all details on 041-422-2023.

FT  18 JUN 92 / Arts: Rambert Dance Company - Ballet
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLEMENT CRISP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The opening programme of the Rambert season on Tuesday night was a
convincing portrait of the company as it has been shaped by Richard Alston.
Two new works, from six the troupe has created during the past year; design
by Richard Smith and Paul Huxley that marks a continuing involvement with
distinguished painters; serious modern scores - Nigel Osborne, David Sawer,
Frederic Rzewski - that inspire movement no less varied and intriguing. The
image is bright, fresh, and we are braced by what we see.
The evening opened with Alston's Wildlife. Dating from 1984, it is one of
his best pieces. Beneath the luminous shapes of Richard Smith's pendant
kites, the choreography explores activities - watchful, sportive, erotic -
that belong to the fauna of some other world. Nigel Osborne's score is
varied in texture, and Alston responds with vivid incidents: a serene
nocturne for Amanda Britton; a sensual duet for Alexandra Dyer and Paul Old;
a group dance that buoyantly matches the gamelan echoes of the score. Here
is an abstraction of animal behaviour that seems all the more potent, and
true, for not being specific.
Alston's newest work is Cat's Eye, with a score by David Sawer whose punchy
rhythms are well suited to dance, and with handsome design by Paul Huxley -
rectangles of solid colour, flown against a midnight blue cloth, that make
the stage area seem vibrant. The dance is as plotless as the decor, but Gary
Lambert is a master of its ceremonies, dancing with ebullient energy, and
marking the score's jazzy nuances with just the suggestion of a shimmy. I am
not sure, after one viewing, how the choreography holds together - if it is,
indeed, intended to cohere - but its varied incidents are pleasing, and
offer a melting, pretty solo to Jacqueline Jones, which she shows off with
great charm.
Siobhan Davies' creation for the company is Winnsboro Cotton Mill Blues.
Industrial life has rarely inspired choreography. Foregger's optimistic
machine dances in early Soviet days; Gertrud Bodenwieser's fascination with
'The Demon Machine' at about the same time; Massine's picture of urban
proletariat in Le Pas d'acier for Diaghilev, were hardly concerned with
industry itself. Even the Marxist spectacles staged by workers' dance groups
during the Depression in New York were more protest than explanation. What
Davies has done is to make a subtle, compassionate comment upon an
industrial community.
Her starting point is Frederic Rzewski's eponymous piano score, which
develops from an rhythmic mimicry of machine noise into a touching 'blues'.
Alexandra Dyer and Amanda Britton first appear, in a prelude that evokes
physical exhaustion as well as companionship, and they will similarly
provide a postlude to the work. They are joined by eight dancers whose
movements tell of the routine of factory production, of the tedium of
repetitive industrial action, even - in the way the dance crosses the stage
 -of the movement of shuttle across loom, as if the machine conditioned its
operators. Gabrielle McNaughton is shown as a physically buoyant figure, but
the idea of blues as lament imbues the choreography with an elegiac mood.
Without literalism, and with a characteristic finesse, the dance speaks of
the human - and the industrially dehumanising - condition.
In her finest work, Siobhan Davies offers something of the visual integrity
we see in Gwen John's painting. In this new piece the matching of score,
inspiration and imagery is acutely judged. As a musical note, I salute John
Sweeney's performance of the Rzewski blues, and the excellent account of the
Osborne and Sawer scores by the Mercury Ensemble under Roger Heaton. The
ballets were very well lit, by Peter Mumford and Michael Hulls. The Royalty
Theatre has one of the most hideous of theatrical interiors, but its stage
is well suited for troupes of Rambert size, and the dance looks good.
Rambert Dance Company continues at the Royalty Theatre until June 27 with
varied programmes.

A survey commissioned by Business Matters (7.30 BBC2) compares the share
price performance of companies in which families own more than 25 per cent
of the stock with the FT All Share Index and shows that in the 21 years
after 1970 the family companies out-performed the FT index substantially. It
seems that the UK's top performing family company is a mail order business
called N Brown which disregards slimming and fitness fads and sells the sort
of outsize clothes so many Britons need and so many shops don't sell. Can it
really be that easy?
Not if your business happens to be property, perhaps. This Week (10.40 ITV)
investigates the misery caused by the most recent property crash, talking to
the inhabitants of Gigha, a Hebridean island now owned by a Zurich bank. It
seems that the property company of entrepreneur Malcolm Potier, 'Laird' of
Gigha, went the way of Mountleigh and Canary Wharf. If this week's Pandora's
Box (9.30 BBC2) is again concerned with the impact of science upon society
let's hope it does not repeat last week's mistake and confuse science with
sociology and politics. Today's subject is the Rand Corporation.

FT  18 JUN 92 / Arts: Annie Fischer - Recital
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Miss Fischer is a Hungarian pianist-musician of rare, long-matured gifts,
and in her Royal Festival Hall recital on Tuesday there were rewards enough
to satisfy all those in the audience who have loved and admired her work for
decades now.
It was nevertheless the wrong venue, and the wrong occasion. She had been
enlisted to take the place of Alfred Brendel (laid low by tendinitis) in the
international piano series, sponsored by Technics Hi-fi. But Miss Fischer is
no longer a 'hi-fi' pianist: she is a distinguished, elderly lady whose
technical grip sometimes falters and whose fingers often slip, though her
musical instincts remain wonderfully vital.
A large part of the audience attracted to a recital-series like this one
consists of younger hi-fi listeners, accustomed to nothing less than
near-perfect execution - and much disconcerted by wrong notes. She should
not have been playing to them, but to an audience of attentive aficionados
in, say, the Queen Elizabeth Hall or the Wigmore. That said, I can report
that in Schumann and Beethoven she was prodigal as ever with direct,
unadorned insights.
Schumann's Kinderszenen, the 'Scenes from Childhood', were utterly
idiosyncratic: neither child's-eye nor cut-glass, but forthright and
urgently felt. Sometimes bumpy, too; and Miss Fischer chose wilfully to
repeat section after section ad libitum - always, of course, with fresh
lighting. That composer's Sonata in F-sharp minor emerged as a seamless
lyrical whole, with an impulse so steadily consistent that one barely
noticed the breaks between movements.
In Beethoven's Sonata op. 27 no. 2, the initial 'Moonlight' Adagio was
strong, sonorous, emphatically pointed; the Scherzo oddly smooth and
gracious, its half-staccatos and rests melted away by perpetual pedalling.
In the Finale Miss Fischer generated more exciting drama than I've heard
from any pianist in some while. His op. 111 Sonata rose above a lot of
finger-slips toward a grand, humane vision. No motorised virtuosity here,
nor cosmetically ethereal effects; but a transparent, unblinking concern for
the sense of the whole work. It was a kind of lesson in advanced musical
ethics: just what we love Miss Fischer most for.

RUSSELL v NORTHERN BANK DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION LTD AND OTHERS
House of Lords (Lord Griffiths, Lord Jauncey of Tullichettle, Lord Lowry,
Lord Mustill, Lord Slynn of Hadley): June 11 1992
PART OF an agreement by which shareholders, without binding future
shareholders, agree personally between themselves as to the manner in which
they will exercise their voting powers on the creation of share capital, is
enforceable and severable from that part of the same agreement which is
unenforceable in that the company agrees to fetter its own statutory power
to create capital.
The House of Lords so held when allowing an appeal by Mr Samuel Russell from
a decision of the Court of Appeal in Northern Ireland that an agreement
between him and the defendant shareholders of Tyrone Brick Ltd (TBL), a
company set up by the first defendant, Northern Bank Development Corporation
Ltd, was invalid.
LORD JAUNCEY said that during the 1970s Northern Bank and its wholly owned
subsidiary, Corporation, lent or invested substantial sums in two
brickmaking companies in Killough, County Down, and Dungannon, County
Tyrone.
The former was unsuccessful whereas the latter prospered.
In 1979 Corporation devised a scheme whereby control of both companies came
to be vested in a new holding company, TBL, with an authorised share capital
of Pounds 1,000 divided into 1,000 shares of Pounds 1 each.
An essential part of the scheme was that the four executives who ran the
Dungannon works should manage TBL. To that end 20 shares in TBL were
allotted to each of them. A further 120 were allotted to Corporation, but no
allotment was made of the remaining 800. On November 14 1979 a shareholders'
agreement was executed by the four executives including Mr Russell, and by
TBL. Although TBL bore to be a party to the agreement, it never executed it.
The agreement provided inter alia that whereas Corporation and the
executives were the holders of the entire issued share capital, and the
shareholders had agreed to regulate their relationship with regard to
management and control of the company, the terms of agreement should have
precedence over the articles of association.
Clause 3 provided that 'no further share capital shall be created or issued
. . . without the written consent of each of the parties hereto'.
On March 10 1988 the TBL board gave notice to shareholders of an
extraordinary general meeting on March 30 to consider two ordinary
resolutions:
(1) that the capital be increased to Pounds 4m by the creation of Pounds
3.999m ordinary shares of Pounds 1 each ranking pari passu with the existing
issued ordinary shares; and
(2) that it was desirable to capitalise the Pounds 3.999m and, accordingly,
that the directors be authorised and directed to appropriate the sum for
distribution to the holders of the ordinary shares in proportion to the
amounts paid up.
Before the meeting Mr Russell issued a writ against the other original
shareholders, claiming an injunction to restrain them from voting on the
resolutions.
The parties went to trial on the issue whether the arrangement was binding
on all the shareholders, including Corporation which had not executed it. On
that issue Mr Russell was successful and no further question thereanent
arose.
However, during the trial Mr Justice Murray of his own motion ordered that
TBL be joined as defendant, and dismissed the action on the ground that
article 3 of the agreement constituted an attempt to fetter TBL's statutory
power to increase its capital and was accordingly invalid.
The Court of Appeal by majority (Lord Justice MacDermott dissenting) upheld
the conclusion on invalidity, and dismissed the appeal.
At the date of the proposed extraordinary general meeting TBL had statutory
power to increase its share capital.
The issue was whether article 3 of the agreement constituted an unlawful and
invalid fetter on that statutory power, or whether it was no more than an
agreement between shareholders as to their manner of voting in a given
situation.
Both parties accepted the long-established principle that a company could
not forgo its right to alter its articles (Southern Founderies v Shirlaw
(1940) AC 701).
The principle must apply also to the right of a company to alter its
memorandum.
Mr McCartney for Mr Russell argued that the agreement did not contravene the
principle, in that it was merely an agreement between shareholders outside
the scope of company legislation, which in no way fettered TBL's power to
alter its memorandum and articles.
Mr Girvan for the defendants submitted that the agreement was not only a
voting arrangement between shareholders inter se, but was tantamount to an
article of association which constituted a restriction of TBL's power to
alter its share capital.
While a provision in a company's articles which restricted its statutory
power to alter those articles was invalid, an agreement dehors the articles
between shareholders as to how they should exercise their voting rights on a
resolution to alter the articles, was not necessarily so.
In Walton v Saffery (1897) AC 299,331 Lord Davey accepted that shareholders
might lawfully agree inter se to exercise their voting rights in a manner
which, if it were dictated by the articles and binding on the company, would
be unlawful.
The agreement was intended to regulate the relationship between the
shareholders with regard to management and control of TBL.
However, it was executed not only by the shareholders, but also by TBL.
In Bushell v Faith (1929) 2 Ch 438,447 Lord Justice Russell said a company
could not 'by its articles or otherwise' deprive itself of its power to
alter its articles. He said such an article was ineffective, 'but a
provision as to voting rights which has the effect of making a special
resolution incapable of being passed if a particular shareholder . . .
exercises his voting rights against a proposed alteration, is not such a
provision'.
If clause 3 had been embodied in the articles of association so as to be
binding on all persons who were or might become shareholders in TBL, it
would have been invalid. But it was not so embodied.
The significant part of Lord Justice Russell's dictum was 'articles or
otherwise'.
Those words appeared to recognise that it was not only fetters on the power
to alter articles of association imposed by the statutory framework of a
company which were obnoxious.
The purpose of clause 3 appeared to be twofold. The shareholders agreed only
to exercise their voting powers in relation to the creation or issue of
shares in TBL if they and TBL agreed in writing.
That agreement was purely personal to the shareholders who executed it, and
did not purport to bind future shareholders. It was just such a private
agreement as was envisaged by Lord Davey in Walton v Saffery.
TBL on the other hand agreed that its capital would not be increased without
each shareholder's consent.
That was a clear undertaking by TBL in a formal agreement not to exercise
its statutory powers for a period which could last for as long as any one of
the parties to the agreement remained a shareholder, and long after the
control of TBL had passed to shareholders who were not party to the
agreement.
As such an undertaking it was as obnoxious as if it had been contained in
the articles of association, and was therefore unenforceable, being contrary
to article 131 of the Companies (Northern Ireland) Order 1986.
TBL's undertaking was, however, independent of and severable from that of
the shareholders, and there was no reason why the latter should not be
enforceable by the shareholders inter se as a personal agreement which in no
way fettered TBL in the exercise of its statutory powers.
The appeal was allowed.
Their Lordships agreed.
For Mr Russell: Robert McCartney QC and John Thompson (Sharpe Pritchard).
For the defendants: Paul Girvan QC and Ben Stephens (Herbert Smith).

FT  18 JUN 92 / People: Taking an early shower
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Christopher Wilson, who always knew he preferred bathrooms to coal, is
leaving Young, the Durham-based mining and haulage company, after less than
a year as finance director.
Over-extension at Young helped to prompt the removal of company founder Bob
Young as chairman and chief executive and the arrival of a new management
team earlier this month. With the help of new financial backers, Young is
refocusing its activities in readiness for opportunities likely to arise
from the privatisation of British Coal.
Wilson, who departs with effect from an extraordinary general meeting (to
approve the refinancing) probably in August, is cagey about his new
endeavour. But he terms it a personal decision, adding that he is responding
to the chance to become chief executive of, and a shareholder in, a new
London-based company in an area 'not far off' bathrooms - an already
familiar field.
Brian Calver, the new group managing director, says: 'He hasn't told me what
it is. I think a friend of his is setting something up.' He remarks that he
is sorry to see Wilson go but denies there is any wider significance in the
departure. 'He has seen greener pastures, as happens in business.'
Wilson's previous experience includes a spell between 1984 and 1988 as
finance director of Smallbone, an upmarket manufacturer of customised
bathrooms and kitchens, which was acquired by Williams Holdings. Wilson then
led a management buyout of bathroom products specialists B C Sanitan, part
of Smallbone, from Williams. But the mbo fell short of its targets and
Wilson left in 1990. He describes himself as having 'kicked around' before
getting into the coal business.

Clive Strowger (left), who resigned as chief executive of the troubled
Mountleigh property group last September, seems to have been rehabilitated
in the eyes of the City establishment. He is to take over as group chief
executive of APV, the world's biggest food machinery maker. (see Observer)
APV has been looking for a new chief executive for many months following the
early retirement of Fred Smith who had headed the group since 1984.
Strowger, 50, a former finance director of Grand Metropolitan, is returning
to the other side of an industry he knows well. During his 12 years at
GrandMet he headed the brewing, consumer services, foods and retail and
property divisions.
APV also announced yesterday that Richard Fenny (right), 42, has been lured
away from Fluor to be director of the group's liquid foods division. He
replaces Mike Smith, who resumes the role of corporate development director.

FT  18 JUN 92 / People: Watson ends family monopoly of Waddington
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
While the game may be over for Robert Maxwell's tangled web of companies,
Victor Watson (right), the chairman of Waddington who yesterday announced
his plan to retire in 1993, can claim to have fingered the publishing baron
almost a decade ago.
Watson, the last in a line of Watsons at the Waddington helm which started
in 1913, successfully fended off two bids from Maxwell, partly because of
the discovery by his advisers Kleinwort Benson of the publisher's murky
Liechtenstein connections.
Watson fought off two other bids during his 40 years at Waddington: from
Mordon in 1965 and Norton Opax in 1983. The latter, says Watson, was the
spark for Maxwell's first attempt on Waddington. 'He was like a shark who
smelled blood,' Watson once said.
His stalwart defence of the games-to-packaging company is in keeping with
family tradition. His grandfather, a Leeds lithographer, originally rescued
Waddington from liquidation in 1913.
Watson's father - and predecessor as chairman - later revived an
again-flagging Waddington by inventing a machine to mass-produce playing
cards. Watson Jr, now 63, plans a working retirement on the boards of, among
others, Yorkshire Television and John Foster and Sons.
Although his successor has not been named, former chief executive and
ex-England rugby captain, David Perry (left), has been appointed deputy
chairman.
*****
John McKeown, managing director of Ansells, Allied-Lyons's Birmingham-based
pub company, is to resign the position to concentrate on his role as retail
services director for the group's retailing division.
McKeown, who joined the group in 1972, will be responsible for identifying
and implementing best retailing practices throughout the sector, which
covers Allied's international franchise business, UK pubs and off-licences.
He will also be directly responsible for acquisitions, purchasing and
leisure machines across the UK pub operations.

Martin Grant, who joined Allied from Whitbread two years ago, and at present

FT  18 JUN 92 / Technology: Wellcome's cures for despair - In the run-up to
the drug company's share offer, FT writers look at its Aids and herpes
treatments
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

REMEMBER herpes? In the early 1980s a herpes epidemic, carried on a tide of
sexual promiscuity, appeared to be sweeping through the west. Then along
came Aids. Herpes sank from public view.
The disease is still incurable and its incidence is still growing. Up to 40
per cent of US citizens have recurrent cold sores caused by the herpes
virus. As for genital herpes, an estimated 20m US citizens are infected.
Paradoxically, herpes has become even more significant since the discovery
of HIV. Clinicians believe that individuals with lesions caused by herpes
transmit the HIV virus more easily. Effective treatment of herpes may
therefore help prevent the spread of HIV. In addition, Aids patients become
highly vulnerable to viruses of the herpes family, which can prove fatal.
Analysts at Barclays de Zoete Wedd, the UK brokers, estimate that the world
market for anti-herpes drugs increased from Dollars 35m (Pounds 19.2m) in
1981 to Dollars 1bn last year. Wellcome, the leading anti-viral drug
company, has about 70 per cent of this market. Its best-selling drug is
Zovirax, which last year generated sales of Pounds 471m.
Zovirax is a guanine nucleoside analogue which is inert and non-toxic to
normal cells. However, when the drug enters a cell containing the herpes
virus it reacts with an enzyme created by the virus to become a
triphosphate. Once converted, the triphosphate interacts with the virus' DNA
structure and stops the virus replicating.
The mechanism is similar to the effect of AZT on HIV. Zovirax cannot
eliminate the herpes but by preventing the virus multiplying it reduces the
effects and length of herpes attacks.
Since the drug was first licensed in 1981, Zovirax has been used to prevent
the herpes recurring. A recent five-year study demonstrated that patients
with recurrent genital herpes treated with Zovirax were seven times less
likely to have another attack.
The drug has also been licensed for herpes-related diseases. One is
cytomegalovirus (CMV); another is varicella zoster which causes chicken-pox
and shingles.
Much of the sales growth of Zovirax is likely to come from the treatment of
shingles, which often affects the elderly. About four people per 1,000 over
65 years old contract shingles. Zovirax only received a US licence for
shingles in 1991 so Wellcome has just started to exploit the market.
However, because the zoster virus is less susceptible to Zovirax than herpes
itself, the dosing needs to be at least four times greater. BZW estimates
sales for shingles alone will be worth Pounds 100m over the next two years.
The medicine is also being used for transplant patients infected with CMV or
shingles. About 31,400 people received transplants in the US last year and
the number is growing by between 12 and 15 per cent a year.
Transplant patients are given immunosuppressants to prevent their immune
systems rejecting the organ. But an additional effect is to make the
patients highly vulnerable to herpes-related diseases. Myron Levin of the
University of Colorado estimates about 40 per cent of bone marrow patients
have zoster and about 75 per cent CMV. Both diseases are capable of killing
the patients.
Hoare Govett, the UK brokers, estimates that increasing use of Zovirax for
herpes, transplant and Aids patients will allow sales to increase from
Pounds 471m last year to Pounds 875m by 1994.
Competition to Zovirax at present is limited. Any new drugs will need to
demonstrate they are safer, more effective, or more powerful and so need
less frequent doses.
SmithKline Beecham, the Anglo-American group, is developing two compounds,
Famcyclovir and Penciclovir. Both are better absorbed than Zovirax and work
longer.
Meanwhile, Wellcome is developing two compounds, known as 256U87 and 882U87.
At a recent conference in Berlin on herpes, clinicians were told that 256
was absorbed into the body three to four times more readily than Zovirax,
the existing treatment. The drug is in late clinical trials.
Meanwhile, 882 has been shown to be highly effective against CMV. The drug
is in earlier clinical trials to determine the right dosing.
Wellcome hopes to have both 256 and 882 on the market during the mid-1990s.
In the meantime, human behaviour being what it is, demand for its viral
products will continue to increase unabated.

FEW drugs have aroused more passionate feelings, for and against, than
Wellcome's AZT - launched five years ago and still the only licensed
treatment for HIV and Aids in most parts of the world.
A wave of enthusiasm carried AZT (also known by the trade name of Retrovir)
through the development process at record speed. Less than three years
passed between the discovery of its antiviral activity in November 1984 and
regulatory approval in March 1987.
Instead of gratitude, Wellcome received an onslaught from US Aids activists
who thought the UK company was profiting unreasonably from their suffering,
by making patients pay several thousand dollars a year for AZT.
The furore over pricing died away after Wellcome cut recommended prices and
doses of AZT. But the drug remains controversial, as critics draw attention
to its side-effects and cast doubt on its effectiveness.
At one extreme are Peter Duesberg of the University of California, Berkeley,
and his small but well-publicised band of followers. They attack the
conventional medical view that Aids is a viral disease caused by HIV and
they say AZT is a dangerous drug which can harm the patients and even cause
Aids-like symptoms.
Such arguments outrage the medical establishment. The evidence for
Duesberg's claim that AZT is 'Aids by prescription' is 'about as strong as
saying that since many people with a toothache also take aspirin, aspirin
causes toothaches', says Dai Rees, secretary of the UK Medical Research
Council. 'A number of careful clinical studies have shown that AZT can be
beneficial to patients with Aids.'
Tony Pinching, an Aids specialist at St Bartholemew's Hospital, London, says
hostility to AZT is partly a reaction against 'over-enthusiastic
extrapolations' from some incomplete clinical trials, which exaggerated the
benefits of the drug for Aids patients and particularly for people infected
with HIV but not showing Aids symptoms.
'A lot reflects differences between people's dreams and aspirations and what
they can actually prove from the data,' Pinching says. Like most European
doctors, he believes the clinical evidence that AZT prolongs the life of
Aids patients is overwhelming, but he is less convinced by the evidence that
early treatment of asymptomatic HIV carriers will help them in the long run.
AZT is a 'nucleoside analogue' drug. It works by mimicking thymidine, one of
the building blocks of genetic material. When HIV incorporates an AZT
molecule instead of thymidine into its growing DNA chain, it jams the
mechanism by which the virus replicates. AZT slows down the rate at which
HIV infects cells of the human immune system but it cannot eliminate the
virus, let alone 'cure' Aids.
Scores of competing drugs are at various stages of development. Furthest
advanced are two other nucleoside analogues: DDI (marketed by Bristol-Myers
Squibb as Videx) and DDC (Roche's Hivid). DDI is approved in the US as a
second-line therapy for Aids patients who are not responding well to AZT and
similar approval is expected soon for DDC. Both drugs have side effects,
though these do not include bone marrow suppression, which is the most
serious problem caused by AZT.
Behind them are more nucleoside analogues - including the promising 3TC
licensed by Glaxo from Biochem Pharma of Canada - and others which claim to
work through a bewildering array of mechanisms. They include protease
inhibitors, therapeutic vaccines (which aim to stimulate the immune response
of people already infected with HIV) and even gene therapy.
In the short term, the newcomers will not necessarily threaten AZT's sales,
because many specialists believe the best approach to Aids therapy is to use
a combination of drugs including AZT. The main reason for this is that
viruses are much less likely to develop resistance when two or more drugs
are taken together.
Sales of AZT levelled off at about Pounds 170m a year during 1990 and 1991
but they are now growing again. London pharmaceutical analysts, who have
studied Wellcome in preparation for this summer's share offer, predict
growth of around 25 per cent a year up to 1994.
Progress after that will depend on whether the company can persuade large
numbers of asymptomatic HIV carriers to take AZT in an effort to ward off
Aids symptoms. And that will require clinical evidence good enough to
overcome the widespread antagonism to AZT.

FT  18 JUN 92 / Technology: Water power used for fire-fighting
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Tragedies such as the fire on a British Airtours Boeing 737 at Manchester
airport in 1985 have underlined the need for novel approaches to ensuring
aircraft safety.
The disaster, in which 55 people died, was one of the worst in British
aviation history. Seven years later comes the launch of a range of products
powered by a technology that gives new meaning to fighting fire with water.
The spearhead of the new approach, developed by Hull-based Fenner Water
Hydraulics, is precisely that - a Fire Spear which drills through an
aircraft side in seven seconds, and then switches to a high-pressure water
spray. The system is based on innovative water motors, which use water both
as a power source and a lubricant.
The spear is an apt first application for a revival of commercial interest
in water hydraulics, neglected since the development of hydraulic oils but
now making a comeback.
The Fire Spear, now being evaluated by a number of European civil aviation
authorities, creates a 'water curtain' - a fine mist which can envelop toxic
gases and drop them to the floor, preventing the sudden spread of fire in an
effect known as flashover.
The key to the system is the broad application of Fenner's pump and motor
technology. With water as the power source, a fireman can quickly run a hose
out to the fire and then decide whether to use the Fire Spear or attach a
cutting tool or saw, says John McCullough, Fenner project director.
The rotary equipment such as the spear and saw developed by Fenner are
water-lubricated, but its water intensifier pump for linear equipment - such
as the cutters known by firemen as 'Jaws of Life' - will be able to handle
water or oil-lubricated tools.
According to McCullough, the new system has a number of advantages other
than speed. It is quieter than the petrol-powered oil power pack currently
used for fire-fighting equipment, reducing stress for the accident victims.
And, in contrast to pyrotechnic processes used to start much fire-fighting
equipment, it can be turned on and off at will.
The package of mobile fire-fighting equipment is being marketed worldwide by
Warwick-based Godiva. Andrew Thompson, sales and marketing director, intends
to develop the UK market first for the linear hydraulic tools, and has won
the first order from a UK fire brigade. But he sees the Fire Spear as having
immediate international appeal.
McCullough, meanwhile, has been investigating other applications for
Fenner's water motors, which are one third the size of equivalent electric
motors. In particular, he sees an opportunity in replacing sprinkler systems
currently using halon, an ozone-damaging gas which, according to the 1989
Helsinki declaration on CFCs, should be phased out as soon as feasible.
Other applications could include subsea work, where only a single line would
be needed. 'In diving, you don't need the water back,' says McCullough. In
modified form, the system could run on salt water.

FT  18 JUN 92 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Supply chain in need
of wholesale reform - The emerging consumer markets of central Europe have
provided challenges and surprises for western companies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GUY DE JONQUIERES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Cuban cigars at Pounds 10 a box of 25, chocolate bars from Lesotho, imported
Marlboro cigarettes 30 per cent more expensive than local ones . . . the
shops and crowded street markets of Poland often seem to obey the random
economics of an Arab souk.
In Hungary, retailing is more orderly but still has its surprises. 'You name
it, Indian toothpaste, obscure Brazilian brands - you can buy almost
anything,' says Andre Mico of Unilever.
In both countries erratic deliveries mean that many products - particularly
imported ones - come and go from the shelves without warning. Western
expatriate shoppers quickly learn to buy their favourite items in bulk and
store them at home.
For western companies seeking to do business in central Europe, the
bewildering disorganisation of the region's distribution trade is one of the
biggest and most frustrating obstacles.
In Poland, officials say liberalisation has trebled the amount of retailing
space in the past three years. Ashley Summerfield of the Central Europe
Trust, a London-based consultancy, reckons that 110,000 new outlets have
sprung up, half of them pavement kiosks.
However, the government's failure to liberalise the property market has led
to soaring shop rentals. These have increased more than 30-fold in central
Warsaw, pushing many small retailers to the brink of bankruptcy.
Marc Pol, a three-year-old Polish company, has set up more than 50
supermarkets and cash-and-carry stores. However, Marek Mikuskiewicz, Marc
Pol's president, admits that he now faces a shortage of capital and growing
cash flow problems.
Though retailing reform in Hungary has been less sweeping, the sector was
better placed to start with, thanks to the greater tolerance of its former
communist rulers. Department stores and supermarkets are relatively common.
Czemene, one of the largest chains, has been acquired by Julius Meinl, an
Austrian retailer, which is renovating the stores and training staff in
western techniques.
But an executive of a large western consumer products company operating in
Hungary, while applauding Meinl's efforts, says results will take time: 'We
find we can negotiate with Meinl at the top, but on the ground things don't
work very well'.
Wholesaling in both countries is also haphazard. Once dominated by
state-owned monopolies, it has been thrown open to private competitors. Many
are individuals whose only asset is a truck and who cannot guarantee
delivery of products to their destination.
Determining trade creditworthiness is difficult for western suppliers, many
of whom insist on payment in cash. Many western companies use their own
newly-created sales teams to deliver products to larger stores.
Another obstacle to controlling the supply chain is the flow of illegal
imports, which higher duties and tariffs have manifestly failed to check. As
well as threatening western suppliers' efforts to establish orderly
distribution, 'grey' imports play havoc with pricing policies.
Andrzej Szwarc of DMS reckons that at least a quarter of all Mars bars sold
in Poland are smuggled in. Though devaluations have increased their cost,
Mars has had to reduce the retail price in the past year to avoid being
undercut by unauthorised imports.
DMS is also trying to build retailer loyalty by working closely with larger
outlets to improve standards of display, stock control and customer service.
Many other suppliers of western products are adopting similar tactics. By
building such relationships, they believe they are making worthwhile
investments.
But even the most optimistic concede that it may be some time before those
investments really pay off.

Europe have provided challenges and surprises for western companies

Selling petfood for Dollars 1.50 a can might seem a thankless task in a
country where monthly incomes average Dollars 150 (Pounds 82). But Mars, the
US-owned manufacturer of Pedigree Pal, Whiskas and chocolate bars, has found
a way.
'We tell our sales people to convince shopkeepers to open a can of petfood
and taste it. Then they usually agree to stock it,' says Andrzej Szwarc,
national sales manager of DMS, a Warsaw company which handles Mars' sales
and marketing in Poland.
Sales of Mars' petfood are now booming, says Szwarc, who knows one old lady
who regularly shares a can with her cat. 'And in all-night convenience
stores, Whiskas is selling rather well with alcohol,' he says.
Though few western companies have resorted to quite such unorthodox sales
methods in central Europe, most have found that the region's emerging
markets present challenges and surprises to which conventional marketing
textbooks offer few solutions.
At first sight, the task seems deceptively easy. Consumers are eager for
western products and many already knew of western brand names from watching
western television long before the collapse of communism. Since then,
consumer imports have flooded in and the region's nouveau riche classes have
flocked to buy anything with a designer label.
White goods manufacturers Electrolux and Philips-Whirlpool say one of their
best-sellers in Hungary is microwave ovens, almost unknown in the country
two years ago.
However, this commercial bombardment risks back-firing by antagonising
consumers who have not before faced the full blast of Madison Avenue
techniques and are bewildered by the region's lurching progress towards free
markets.
Many foreign products in the shops have been dumped or imported illegally by
middlemen interested in a quick profit, not in building a long-term
business. Quality is often variable, deliveries erratic and pricing
unpredictable. Rafael Lopez-Apparicio, general manager of Kodak in Hungary,
says the result is confused consumers.
Michel Olszewski of Research International, a market research firm, believes
uncontrolled and indiscriminate imports have hurt the image of western
brands.
Building brand loyalty is a high priority for most western companies - and
reaching mass markets is not difficult. In Poland and Hungary more than 90
per cent of homes have televisions and, despite recent rate increases, air
time is relatively cheap.
The problem is choosing the message. 'We aren't yet very clear about
consumer habits,' admits Andre Mico, head of Unilever in Hungary. 'Western
products are perceived as better, but that doesn't mean you can sell
anything.'
Many companies have plunged in with western-made commercials for western
products - with mixed results. In Poland a commercial for Cola Cao, a
Spanish chocolate drink, which featured a muscular black athlete, went down
so badly that the product almost vanished from the market.
Procter &amp; Gamble's heavy promotion of Vidal Sassoon's Wash &amp; Go backfired in
Poland when sales fell on rumours that the shampoo-conditioner caused hair
loss. P&amp;G's candid peak-time commercials for Allways, a sanitary tampon,
have also proved controversial, while recent newspaper advertisements
headlined 'We respect the Poles' were regarded by many as condescending.
The company's commercials for Tampax and Ariel detergent have been better
received. But many Polish consumers are baffled by the punch line of
Henkel's German-made commercial for Persil, which translates as 'You know
what you have'.
'The philosophy of most western companies is to sell first and understand
the market later,' says Eugeniuscz Smilowski of Pentor, a private Polish
market research company. He also warns that hard-sell advertising can easily
rebound by 'creating suspicions that companies want to dump on us trash that
they can't sell in the west'.
Some companies, though, are praised for respecting local sensitivities.
Unilever test-markets its central European advertising carefully and has
continued a popular commercial developed by the Polish detergents maker it
acquired last year.
To appeal to Poland's Catholic family tradition, Johnson &amp; Johnson adapted a
western commercial for its baby care products to include shots of a husband
holding an infant and sharing household tasks. 'We stopped just short of
putting a cross round his neck,' says Marek Janicki, managing director of
ITI-McCann Erickson, the Warsaw agency which handled the commercial
In Hungary, Shell has included local scenes in a west European commercial,
while Philips' sales of consumer electrical and electronics goods have
benefited from a locally-made campaign.
'People have had enough of western commercials, they want something designed
for them,' says Miklos Cspregi, head of the Budapest office of Ogilvy &amp;
Mather, which developed the Shell and Philips campaigns. He also believes a
trend may be developing in favour of local products. Benckiser of Germany
has begun to stress in advertisements the local origin of Tomi, a detergent
it makes in Hungary, while Unilever is using the theme 'Produced locally to
international standards' for products it makes in central Europe.
However, care is needed. Warsaw shopkeepers say sales of some previously
imported western products fell after they were re-packaged with instructions
in Polish, because consumers feared the goods were no longer genuine.
Opinions also differ about the use of 'aspirational' advertisements
depicting glamorous western lifestyles. The approach seems to work for
familiar items like toilet soap. But for new and more sophisticated
products, a more down-to-earth, educational treatment often seems to go down
better.
But some western companies believe the power of advertising will remain
limited until retail distribution improves. They are emphasising gaining
control of the supply chain and ensuring that products are consistently
available, in good condition and attractively displayed at the point of
sale. Many bigger companies are also working with selected retailers to get
them to offer better customer service.
But in such rapidly-changing and poorly understood markets, experimentation
is likely to remain important for some time yet. As George Swirski, head of
PepsiCo Foods International in Poland, puts it: 'If you don't take risks, if
you aren't prepared to make mistakes, then you don't deserve to succeed.'

FT  18 JUN 92 / Political Notebook: Less heat, some light
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RAYS OF light have begun to replace some of the intense heat in the
Conservative party generated by the Maastricht accords.
Mr John Major's return from Rio has prompted more sober reflection among
potential rebels on the wisdom of denigrating an agreement once hailed as a
personal triumph for their leader.
The more precocious of the new intake of Tory MPs have been reminded by the
party whips of how dull life on the back benches can become after 10 or 15
years.
The two dozen or so hardened Euro-sceptics have not changed their minds.
They never will. But many of those who happily signed up to last week's
synthetic rebellion are having second thoughts.
Of course it may not last. If the Irish vote against, there will be no
shortage of Tories ready to dance on the grave of the deal struck by their
prime minister.
Mr Major will be faced then with rebuilding from scratch the fragile
complexes of compromises with his own party and with Britain's European
partners he constructed after Margaret Thatcher's downfall.
There would be no certainty that he could again reconcile the federalist
ambitions of European colleagues with the instinctive nationalism of his
party.
Whichever way the Irish vote goes, the Tory anti-federalists at Westminster
will make mischief when Mr Major acquiesces in the reappointment of Mr
Jacques Delors at the Lisbon summit.
But if the Irish forsake the Danish option, Mr Major will be able to ride
out such turbulence. He will win a breathing space to map out a strategy for
the British presidency to restore his grip on his party without risking his
claim to have returned Britain to the heart of Europe.
His starting point remains that Britain is better off with the Maastricht
accords than without them.
Ministers do not really believe their public claims that the accords
represented a triumph for decentralisation over federalism. Their private
assessment is that Maastricht was a draw - that Britain managed to defer
until the next conference in 1996 the most difficult arguments about the
distribution of power within the community. But Mr Major bought time.
The choice he managed to finesse in December - was Britain's place at the
core or on the periphery of Europe? - would return with a vengeance if
Maastricht collapsed.
Ironically, Mr Norman Lamont, one of the Cabinet's less committed Europeans,
would be among those with most to lose. For a day or two, the chancellor
appeared to be quietly celebrating the Danish result. Now he is more
circumspect.
It is perhaps no accident that the apparent change of heart coincides with a
worrying Whitehall assessment of the possible Franco-German reaction to the
collapse of EMU.
What, some ministers are asking, would Britain do if Paris persuaded Bonn
and the others among the original six to bypass formal treaty changes by
simply locking irrevocably their exchange rates in the ERM?
Mr Lamont could keep sterling outside such a fixed system but he would pay a
high price in terms of British interest rates and the pace of economic
recovery.
The stark choices would not be confined to EMU. The collapse of the treaty
on political union might undermine decisively efforts to ensure that
Franco-German plans for a joint military force do not detach Europe from the
US.
So, Ireland permitting, Mr Major intends to press on with efforts to bring
Denmark back into the fold. There will be no rush to a confrontation with
Tory doubters. Ministers now refer to ratification during the first half of
next year - during the Danish presidency.
But Mr Major's hope is that the formula to change Danish minds could have
the same effect on Tory doubters.
The talk is of addenda to Maastricht that would commit the 12 not only to a
much tighter definition of Community responsibilities and to more
intergovernmental co-operation but also to an acceleration of preparations
for enlargement.
There is much that could go wrong even if the the Irish endorse the
treaties. But his strong track record suggests that Mr Major has a fighting
chance of persuading his party that by staying on the inside he can come up
with a deal that is good enough for the Danes and even better for the
Tories.

FT  18 JUN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Prescott claims Labour election
campaign hijacked
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE open warfare over responsibility for Labour's election defeat flared
again last night when Mr John Prescott repeated claims that the campaign had
been hijacked by outsiders.
The transport spokesman's charges were described as 'complete rubbish' by Mr
Jack Cunningham, the party's campaigns co-ordinator.
Ms Patricia Hewitt, a former aide to Mr Neil Kinnock now at the centre of
the storm, also counter-attacked against the 'huge cowardice' of people
refusing to take responsibility for decisions reached collectively by the
leadership.
Last night, Mr Stan Orme, Labour MP for Salford East, announced that he
would not be seeking re-election as chairman of the parliamentary Labour
party.

FT  18 JUN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Move on Scots bankruptcies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NATIONALISATION was being used by the government to derail a 'gravy train'
that had provided millions of pounds for Scottish accountants engaged in
insolvency cases, Mr Donald Dewar, shadow Scottish secretary, told the
Commons last night.
Mr Dewar supported provisions in the Bankruptcy (Scotland) bill to save
taxpayers' money by expanding the role of a public official - the Accountant
in Bankruptcy - to give a cost-effective sequestration service in Scotland.
During an earlier discussion on the bill, Mr Dewar stated that in 1991
Pannell Kerr and Forster of Glasgow received sequestration fees totaling
Pounds 3.427m, Ernst &amp; Young Pounds 2.2m, and Cork Gully Pounds 1.9m.
Underlining the need to change the existing system Mr Ian Lang, the Scottish
secretary, said the cost to the taxpayer of financing the administration of
individual sequestrations had risen from Pounds 13,000 in 1986 to Pounds
18.5m in 1991.
The expenditure was accounted for by the payment of fees and outlays of the
private-sector insolvency practitioners who undertook the work.
Mr Lang estimated that if the historical trends in the volume and costs of
sequestrations continued the expenditure would rise to some Pounds 50m by
1993-94 and over Pounds 80m by 1994-95.
He said the level of insolvency in Scotland on a per-capita basis had
changed from being broadly equivalent to the level in England and Wales in
1987 to some three times that level by 1990. Mr Lang insisted that the
change could not be explained through relative economic prosperity or
economic performance.

FT  18 JUN 92 / Supervisors are 'underestimated'
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MANAGERS are confused about what supervisors do and frequently underestimate
their competence, the UK body responsible for setting standards in
management training said yesterday
The Management Charter Initiative disclosed the finding at the launch of the
first national standards outlining best practice for supervisors.
Earlier this month, the Confederation of British Industry published research
showing that supervisors themselves are confused about their jobs. The new
finding adds to general concern at the performance of UK supervisors
compared with their counterparts in Germany and elsewhere. The UK's 1.2m
supervisors have a significant effect on business productivity.
The MCI discovered the confusion, which stems from poor communication
between the two tiers, during trials of the new standards conducted at 200
organisations from every sector of the economy.

FT  18 JUN 92 / Family companies shine
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR

<TEXT>
THE SHARES of family-controlled listed companies have outperformed the
Financial Times All-Share Index by 30 per cent during the past 21 years,
according to a survey published today by accountants Stoy Hayward.
A Pounds 1 investment in 1970 in the 71 family companies in the survey would
have grown to Pounds 11.11 by 1991 compared with Pounds 8.72 for an
investment in the All-Share Index.
Controlling family shareholders attributed that better performance to their
ability to pursue consistent management objectives and take a long-term
view. Family companies were less vulnerable to takeover bids and under less
pressure to deliver short-term returns.
Family businesses were defined as those where a family or family interests
controlled 25 per cent of ordinary shares, but companies dominated by one
individual were excluded. Three quarters of British companies are
family-controlled.
More than 40 per cent of the family companies surveyed achieved a more than
10-fold rise in their share price while seven companies achieved a 50-fold
increase.
Companies in which a family owned more than 40 per cent performed less well
than those where the holding was smaller, the survey found.

FT  18 JUN 92 / Big stride away from megadeath: Assessing the US-Russian
nuclear arms pact
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT MAUTHNER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EVERY time a major nuclear arms control agreement is reached, it tends to be
described as a 'landmark' in the history of disarmament. That was so in July
last year when US President George Bush and Soviet President Mikhail
Gorbachev announced in London that, after nearly 10 years of tough
negotiations, they had agreed on substantial cuts in their strategic
arsenals.
But, if the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (Start) was important as the
first-ever agreement to reduce, rather than just limit strategic weapons, it
is a pale version of the accord to which Mr Bush and Russian President Boris
Yeltsin put their signature in Washington on Tuesday.
Under Start (yet to be ratified) each country was due to cut the number of
strategic nuclear weapons in its arsenal by about 30 per cent. The US was to
have reduced its number of nuclear warheads and bombs from 12,000 to about
9,000; the Soviet Union undertook to cut its nuclear warheads from 11,000 to
7,000.
The latest agreement, however, goes much further than that. It provides for
reductions, in two stages, to less than half the Start totals. By the year
2003, each country will be left with only 3,000 to 3,500 - a reduction of
some two-thirds in present arsenals. However, Russia, already finding it
difficult to meet its commitments under the Start treaty to destroy nuclear
weapons, will require much more US help to achieve the new targets.
Mr Yeltsin, probably with an eye on the quid pro quo he hopes to obtain from
the US and other western countries in the form of economic aid, made very
substantial concessions which were opposed by Russia's military
establishment. The agreement provides for the scrapping of all heavy
land-based intercontinental ballistic missiles, notably more than 300 of
Russia's SS-18 multiple-headed missiles, which the US has always considered
as the most dangerous and most destabilising strategic weapon.
Russia's agreement to the elimination of those weapons, in which it had a
clear advantage over the US, has been matched only in part by Washington's
concession in the main area of overriding US superiority, that of
submarine-launched ballistic missiles. Yet the compromise on a matter on
which the US had adopted a remarkably rigid position, was by no means
insignificant. The number of nuclear warheads on US submarines will be
reduced to 1,750 - a cut of 50 per cent on the limits laid down in Start.
As both Mr Bush and Mr Yeltsin emphasised, the fact that an armed conflict
between the two countries is now considered inconceivable made agreement
much easier. The prohibitive cost of large nuclear arsenals, particularly
for a country in such dire economic straits as Russia, also contributed to a
rapid accord. 'We cannot afford it,' the Russian leader said bluntly.
'Therefore we must have a minimum security level.'
The unanswered question, however, is what that minimum level is. Why did Mr
Bush and Mr Yeltsin stop at 3,000 to 3,500 nuclear warheads each, more than
enough to destroy their countries and populations several times over?
Even if it is accepted that nuclear deterrence has proved its worth by
giving the world nearly 50 years of peace, most experts believe that the
same result could be achieved at a much lower level of nuclear weapons than
those just agreed. The other side of the coin is that the US and Russia are
not concerned only with each other's nuclear forces. They have to plan for
crises in which other nuclear powers - such as China, India and Israel -
might be involved.
The US-Russian agreement also again raises the question of when other
nuclear powers - such as Britain, France and China - should join
negotiations on the reduction of nuclear weapons. The UK and France have
refused to say exactly when that might be, stating merely that their forces
are still insignificant compared to those of the US and Russia, even after
the latest reductions.
However, the new US-Soviet agreement will put added pressure on Britain and
France to follow suit in the field of strategic weapons.

TALKS between the Russian government and the International Monetary Fund in
Moscow on the implementation of economic reform are going slowly and show
numerous points of conflict.
No agreement is thought likely before President Boris Yeltsin meets the
leaders of the Group of Seven industrial countries in Munich on July 8,
after the G7 summit.
The fund wants assurances that the Russian central bank has firm agreements
with the central banks of the other 14 former Soviet republics on the use of
the rouble (still their common curency) before it releases Dollars 6bn to
stablise the Russian currency. The Russian government wants to make the
rouble internally convertible next month.
Other former Soviet republics, including Estonia and Ukraine, say they will
introduce their own currencies soon.
The IMF also wants a firm commitment on the repayment of the former Soviet
debt, for which Russia is now responsible. Russia is paying neither
principal nor interest on the Dollars 60bn-plus debt to Western countries.

TRADE officials from about 40 countries taking part in the Uruguay Round of
trade liberalisation talks yesterday admitted defeat in their attempt to
move forward in the stalled tariff negotiations.
Officials are looking to next month's Munich summit of the seven leading
industrialised nations for progress in the transatlantic wrangle over farm
trade reform, the critical issue blocking the round.
Smaller rich and poor countries had hoped that the United States and the
European Community would agree to reveal enough about their bilateral tariff
negotiations to enable the detailed country-by-country bargaining on market
access to restart.
The US/EC tariff deal, when complete, will set the pattern for others, under
the non-discrimination rule of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade
(Gatt).
But at a meeting called yesterday by Mr Germain Denis, the Canadian chairman
of the market access negotiations, the US and EC again refused to show their
hands.
Both regard the outstanding tariff issues as too sensitive to display in a
wider forum, while admitting that these issues are unlikely to be resolved
without an accord on farm trade.
The tariff negotiations are intended to produce an overall one-third cut in
customs duties on farm and industrial goods.

FT  18 JUN 92 / World Trade News: Big Three look with glee down Mexico way -
The motor industry's enthusiasm for the free trade pact / NAFTA
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAMIAN FRASER and MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   THE Big Three US motor vehicle manufacturers
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
General Motors, Ford and Chrysler - view the prospect of free trade in the
North American car industry with barely concealed glee.
For the proposed North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) will let them
sell more cars to the fast-growing Mexican market, allow them to integrate
their low-cost Mexican operations with those at home, and should give them a
much needed competitive edge over Japanese rivals, at least in the
short-to-medium term.
However, Detroit is keeping its enthusiasm in check for fear of further
antagonising the United Auto Workers union, which opposes a Nafta agreement
in the belief that it will mean a large loss of jobs to Mexico.
Mexican car workers are paid between Dollars 4-Dollars 5 an hour - about a
fifth of wage levels in the US - and are as productive, if not more so. The
Mexicans have proved themselves adept at adopting the quality manufacturing
methods pioneered by Japanese car companies. Ford's plant in the northern
town of Hermosillo was singled out for its efficiency in a recent
Massachusetts Institute of Technology study of the motor industry worldwide.
Although final details of the Nafta vehicle agreement still have to be
worked out, the accord is shaping up as generally favourable to the US
industry. That is hardly surprising, since Detroit's huge existing
investments in the US, Canada and Mexico mean the governments of the three
countries have to weigh its demands carefully.
The governments also know that any Nafta agreement is going to face tough
opposition in the US Congress. One that lacked the support of the car
companies would stand little chance of passage.
One of Detroit's main aims has been to ensure a high level of regional
content in a vehicle for it to qualify for duty-free shipment within the
Nafta area. The aim is to prevent third countries, in particular Japan, from
using Mexico as a cheap-labour export base in their assault on the US
market.
Under the existing US-Canadian free trade agreement, 50 per cent of a
vehicle has to be manufactured in North America. The US government, with the
backing of the Big Three, is proposing that this be raised to 65 per cent
under the Nafta accord.
The Mexicans and Canadians have resisted such a sharp increase, knowing that
existing Japanese manufacturers would find it costly to reach these levels,
while new entrants, which they do not want to scare away, would not be able
do so quickly.
A compromise seems likely to be reached at around 60 per cent. However, just
as important as this raw number will be the method used in the accord to
calculate local content.
This is a contentious issue, underlined by recent claims from the US customs
department that the Canadian subsidiary of Honda, the Japanese car company,
failed to meet the 50 per cent requirement in vehicles it has been shipping
from Canada to the US. In particular, the pact is expected to produce
tighter rules on so-called 'roll-up' - the ability of a company to count a
part as 100 per cent locally made, so long as it contains no more than 49
per cent of imported components.
The only Japanese car company manufacturing in Mexico now is Nissan, which
has 20 per cent of the domestic market. Its local head last year warned that
a 60-70 per cent local content rule was 'totally out of the question' and
would lead to lower Japanese investment in Mexico.
The other significant foreign manufacturer, Volkswagen Mexico, aims to beat
the Americans at their own game, and is pushing for 70 per cent Mexican (and
thus North American) regional content, according to the company's Mexican
sales director.
Volkswagen, which closed its US operations some years ago, is thus bringing
more and more of its European suppliers to Mexico and the company plans to
increase its exports of cars from Mexico to the US and Central and South
America.
Besides defending their flanks against the Japanese, the American car
companies want to use Nafta to grab a larger part of the Mexican domestic
market through exports from their under-utilised US plants. This market is
growing rapidly, with sales in 1995 likely to reach about 1m vehicles, from
an expected 740,000 this year.
The Nafta agreement will liberalise Mexico's 1989 vehicle decree, which sets
local content requirements for vehicles sold in the country, restricts the
number of vehicles a foreign manufacturer may import, and insists that each
manufacturer must export more cars from Mexico than it imports.
The accord sets a 10-year timetable for this liberalisation process.
This will help the Big Three because during this period a company which does
not export from Mexico will not be allowed to import vehicles into the
country.
Most analysts expect that in the long run Mexico will become a leading base
for manufacturing small cars for the US market, many of which are now made
in Asia.
To help the small car trade take off, the Nafta accord would treat Mexico as
'North American' for purposes of the Corporate Average Fuel Economy Act
(Cafe), which dates from the fuel crisis of the 1970s and discourages US
manufacturers from importing small cars.
Mr Victor Barreiro, head of Ford Mexico, says: 'We will have to pick the
place (between the US, Canada and Mexico) where it makes sense to produce a
car.'
The net effect on American jobs is difficult to gauge. The loss of smaller
car manufacturing in the US may be offset by increased exports of vehicles
to Mexico, which is starved of choice.
Furthermore, almost half the parts used by the Big Three in their Mexican
plants originate in the US, so an increase in Mexican output may help the US
components industry.
On the other hand, many of the components manufacturers in the US are known
to be planning expansions in Mexico. 'We see good opportunities there,' says
Mr Larry Bossidy, chairman of Allied-Signal.

NEC, the Japanese electronics company, plans to triple production of
semiconductors at its plant in Roseville, California, by the end of next
year, through investment of Dollars 200m.
The expansion will lift capacity from 10,000 6-inch wafers a month for
4-megabit dynamic random access memory chips (DRAM) to 30,000 wafers a
month.
The decision is a sign of NEC's renewed confidence in the market for memory
chips, which is currently deeply depressed. The company believes the recent
increase in demand coming from US buyers will continue strongly into next
year. The expansion of production will also help NEC to increase sales into
the US market without exacerbating the tense trade relations with the US.
The US has applied pressure on Japan to increase purchases of foreign-made
chips. NEC may introduce to the Roseville plant production of 16M DRAM
chips, the most advanced memory devices.

KAZAKHSTAN and Oman yesterday signed a consortium agreement to build an oil
pipeline to permit the former Soviet republic to export crude from its
Tengiz oilfield.
The consortium, in which each government has a 50 per cent share, will
design, finance and build the pipeline, which is expected to have an
eventual capacity to export 1.5m barrels a day from Tengiz.
Omani consultants say they have identified eight possible routes for the
pipeline, which is expected to take three years to complete at a cost,
depending on the route, of between Dollars 700m and Dollars 1.6bn. The
consortium will subcontract most of the construction work.
The consortium, into which other members may later be admitted, establishes
only the structure to create a means for Kazakhstan to export oil from the
Tengiz field.
A decision to proceed with the pipeline will depend on reaching agreement
with countries including Russia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Turkmenistan, Iran and
Turkey which the pipeline may cross.
Oman's partnership with Kazakhstan arose through its aid in helping the
republic negotiate with Chevron, the US oil company, a deal signed in May
this year to develop the Tengiz field. Tengiz is believed to hold reserves
of between 6bn and 20bn barrels of oil.
The skill of the Gulf sultanate at low-key diplomacy and its good relations
with all countries over which an pipeline may cross also helped cement the
agreement.

<TEXT>
CANADA is backing away from its reputation as one of the world's most
hospitable countries by proposing a more selective system for admitting
immigrants and refugees.
Proposals tabled by Mr Bernard Valcourt, immigration minister, would speed
up the processing of some cases, such as immediate family members of people
already in the country, wealthy investors, and bona fide refugees.
But immigration officers would also get new powers to turn away applicants
for refugee status, and the right of appeal against refugee board decisions
would be more limited.
The aim is to cut the number of applications by about 40 per cent from the
30,000 processed last year.
Canada takes in more immigrants and refugees than any other industrial
country relative to its population. Almost 206,000 newcomers arrived in
1991, and the number is expected to rise to 250,000 this year.

<TEXT>
A TALL Italian diplomat, visibly fatigued by his efforts of the last 36
hours, stood behind Mr Heinrich Strubig and Mr Thomas Kemptner as they were
freed in Beirut yesterday.
In just one year, United Nations envoy Mr Giandomenico Picco has obtained
the liberation of 11 Britons, Americans and Germans in Lebanon, as well as
the freeing last autumn of 90 Lebanese held by the Israelis and their
militia allies.
As he accompanied the two German aid workers in Beirut yesterday, Mr Picco
stressed that his work was not yet completed. He has committed himself to
working for the freedom of all people held without due process of law in the
Middle East.
These include some 200 Lebanese held by Israel's proxy militia, the South
Lebanon Army (SLA), at Khiam prison in southern Lebanon; 30 others, mostly
Lebanese, held inside Israel; four Israelis still missing in Lebanon; and at
least eight SLA militiamen.
Lebanese hostages in Israel include Sheikh Abdul-Karim Obeid, kidnapped from
his home by Israeli troops in 1989. Of the missing Israelis, only airman Ron
Arad is believed still to be alive. Mr Picco is also attempting to achieve
the return of the remains of hostages who died in captivity.
Mr Picco's success to date can be attributed to great personal courage, his
respect of the kidnappers' demands for security and anonymity, and a perhaps
utopian belief that his interlocutors will see that 'violence against the
individual does not work.'
This week, Mr Picco repeatedly met the kidnappers of the two German hostages
to resolve last-minute hitches in their release. He is accustomed to working
alone and behind the scenes, and the presence of a German delegation in
Beirut with constant media coverage made his task more difficult.
'They (the kidnappers) come out more credible, because they have been part
of negotiations in which they have kept their word,' he said. 'They can join
in politics. If it can be proven that things can be done through
negotiations, then the appeal of violence will diminish.'
Mr Picco's efforts over the past year built a fragile chain that was in
danger of breaking if any one party failed to keep its word. Amazingly, he
has been able to persuade Lebanese kidnappers to free their hostages without
fulfilment of their demands.
The morning after American hostage Mr Terry Anderson was released in
December, Mr Picco flew to Bonn to meet the German foreign and justice
ministers regarding Mr Strubig and Mr Kemptner. His words then - and again
yesterday in Beirut - were: 'It's not over yet.'
He added: 'This began not as a story about just 10 or 11 westerners, but
about several hundred people. It is a serious moral and political
commitment. There are a lot of things left to do.'

THE European Community yesterday gave Ecu13m (Pounds 9.1m) to build the
first substantial new hospital in the Gaza strip since 1967, as part of its
growing and controversial Palestinian aid programme in Israel's occupied
territories.
The 232-bed hospital, to be built under a contract signed yesterday with the
United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA), will be near Khan Younis, in
the southern part of Gaza.
It is intended to help improve what the Brussels Commission claims are
deteriorating health conditions among the territory's population of 780,000,
most of them Palestinian refugees.
The EC has traditionally channelled most of its aid to the occupied
territories, amounting to Ecu472m over 1971-91, through UNRWA. But in 1987
it began its own direct aid programme. The Israeli government has allowed an
EC official to supervise this, but at Jerusalem's insistence he is based in
Brussels.
The UNRWA is to give food to Palestinians in Gaza to ease suffering caused
by an Israeli ban on most workers entering Israel, Reuter adds from Gaza.

THE FALLOUT from the bloodshed in Thailand last month could slow the
country's growth rate for the year to between 6.5 and 7.4 per cent,
according to estimates released yesterday by two forecasting agencies.
The figures are the first systematic attempts to measure the impact of the
troubles on one of the world's fastest growing economies.
The more optimistic figure of 7.4 per cent came from the National Economic
and Social Development Board (NESDB), the government's planning agency. The
independent Thailand Development Research Institute (TDRI) predicted growth
would slow to 6.5 per cent.
Both had earlier predicted growth at close to 8 per cent for this year.
Their figures would have been worse if the discord between the military and
the parties that supported it on the one hand, and the civilian opposition
on the other, had not been eased by the appointment of Mr Anand Panyarachun
as a neutral prime minister last week.
The main difference between the two institutes is the assessment of the
decline of tourism, a principal foreign exchange earner. TDRI believes
Thailand could lose almost 29bn baht (Pounds 616bn), or half a percentage
point of gross domestic product this year, although a recovery is predicted
for 1993. The planning agency's estimate is for a loss of between 10bn to
20bn baht.

THE proclamation of Mr Fidel Ramos as winner in the May 11 Philippine
presidential election is expected to take place next Wednesday.
Mr Ramos, a former defence secretary, gained the biggest number of votes in
the count completed around midnight on Tuesday by Congress. A committee is
now preparing a final report to be presented to a joint session next week
which will proclaim the winner.
Also to be proclaimed by Congress is the winning candidate for
vice-president, Mr Joseph Estrada, a former member of the Senate who
originally gained popularity as a film actor.
In the past few days Mr Ramos has been holding meetings with business and
church leaders and with some of his leading opponents in the election.
Mr Ramos, who was supported during the campaign by outgoing President
Corazon Aquino, ended up with more than 874,000 votes ahead of Mrs Miriam
Defensor Santiago, the combative former immigration commissioner.
Members of Congress sympathetic to Mrs Santiago are expected to seek to
delay next week's proclamation proceedings. Mrs Santiago has vowed to round
up support among the youth in protesting at the election results.
In third place was Mr Eduardo Cojuangco, business tycoon and a well-known
associate of former dictator Ferdinand Marcos. Mr Cojuangco trailed Mr Ramos
by 1.22m votes and Mrs Santiago by some 351,000 votes. Mr Ramos won 5.34m
votes, representing 23.6 per cent of the total number of votes counted.

FT  18 JUN 92 / Maastricht: Vote brings ratification nearer in France
</HEADLINE>

   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FRANCE cleared another hurdle on the road to Maastricht in the early hours
of yesterday morning when the senate approved changes in the French
constitution required for ratification of the treaty.
Virtually all the Socialist, centrist and centre-right UDF members voted for
the revision, which was mainly opposed by the Gaullists and the Communists.
The one technical hitch is that the senate introduced detailed amendments to
the text passed by the national assembly. Since the constitution can only be
revised on the basis of identical texts, the senate version will go back to
the assembly today for a new vote.
However, the size of the senate majority (192 in favour and 117 against)
strengthens expectations that the government should be able to complete the
constitutional revision in its final parliamentary phase, a special congress
of the national assembly and the senate, in the palace of Versailles,
probably on June 29.
A three-fifths majority will be required at that meeting. This seems
entirely feasible, since the separate votes in the two houses of parliament
add up to a majority of just over 66 per cent. However, should the congress
fail, the government will submit the Maastricht treaty for ratification in a
popular referendum in the autumn.
Polls continue to suggest that the treaty would be approved in a referendum
 -a Sofres survey shows 59 per cent in favour, 41 per cent against. Mr
Raymond Barre, a leading centrist and a former prime minister, has predicted
a 55-60 per cent vote in favour.
Curiously, the deep disagreements over Europe within the ranks of the
conservative opposition parties, appear not to have dented their general
popularity.
This paradox is most acute in the case of Mr Jacques Chirac, leader of the
RPR Gaullist party. The Gaullists are deeply divided over Maastricht; and Mr
Chirac has announced that he will not take any position on the issue, until
he can see his way more clearly. Yet he continues to stand head and
shoulders above all other conservative leaders in the opinion polls, as the
most popular and most plausible candidate in a presidential election.

   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE GERMAN government and opposition yesterday tried and failed to forge a
common line on the ratification of the Maastricht treaty on European union,
as Chancellor Helmut Kohl insisted that the document could not be
renegotiated.
In an important parliamentary debate intended to stem the growing tide of
public doubt over European integration, the opposition Social Democrats
(SPD) served notice that their approval of the treaty - essential for
ratification - was subject to tough preconditions.
At the same time, the minority Greens called for a national referendum
before ratification, a demand which is supported by some key members of the
SPD, and a by clear majority in recent opinion polls.
Speaker after speaker reminded the German chancellor of the growing public
'Euro-scepticism', and fears for the disappearance of the D-Mark in a future
European currency. They feared German voters were suffering from the same
basic mistrust of political leaders which caused a majority of Danish voters
to reject the Maastricht treaty in their national referendum.
'The policy of European union, which for decades has been taken for granted,
and was in danger of becoming merely boring, is suddenly facing criticism
which is rapidly gaining ground, and appears to be ever more fundamental,'
said Mr Gunter Verheugen, deputy foreign affairs spokesman for the SPD.
'The public was not prepared for European union,' he said. 'The details of
its contents, and above all the introduction of a common European currency,
came as a big shock,' he said.
The same message came from all sides of the house. While they accepted that
the treaty could not easily be renegotiated, several speakers said that it
should somehow be improved, or added to, or corrected with a second
full-scale treaty.
Mr Kohl himself was adamant, seeking to head off the doubts by going over to
the offensive. He rejected any hint of renegotiation, and gave a grim
warning of the dangers of rising nationalism in western Europe, parallel to
the trends in the east.
He warned that fears of the past, and memories of the misdeeds of the Nazi
regime, were still alive in other European countries. There was no
reasonable alternative for Germany than to seek irreversible integration in
a united Europe.
'In western Europe (as in the east) we are not proof against the temptation
of slipping back into nationalistic thinking,' he warned. 'Only with a
determined commitment to European union can we avoid a relapse into the
destructive nationalism of the past.'
Mr Hans-Ulrich Klose, parliamentary leader of the SPD, agreed that Germany
could not and would not be the country to block the Maastricht treaty. But
he also insisted that Germany must not enter the final phase of European
monetary union without a fully fledged parliamentary decision to do so.
That was a formal precondition for SPD support for ratification.
An acceptable deal must also be done with the 16 German Lander on their
future involvement in EC decision-making, the SPD said. The political
parties were largely agreed, but the government was delaying a deal, Mr
Verheugen said.
That is where the real stumbling block to German ratification remains.

FT  18 JUN 92 / Survey of European Building &amp; Construction (9): The
still-missing links - The prospects of completing Europe's train network
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPE'S high-speed rail network represents a potential goldmine for
construction and engineering companies. The project is colossal: at the last
count, it was estimated to involve spending of more than Pounds 100bn to the
year 2010.
But the project's scale raises questions about how realistic it is. While
parts of the network are already in place or under construction,
geographical, technological and financial considerations stand in the way of
its completion.
The outline plan for the high-speed network was devised by an EC working
group in 1990. Taking as its basis the high-speed rail projects already
planned independently by member states, it was completed by pencilling in
the missing cross-frontier links needed to join these disparate systems into
a coherent whole.
On the face of it, construction of the network has got off to a strong
start. The train a grande vitesse, or TGV, is well-established in France:
the TGV Sud-Est between Paris and Lyons was completed in 1983.
In Germany, the first two lines of the InterCity Express high-speed network
opened last year, between Hanover and Wurzburg and between Mannheim and
Stuttgart; in Spain, the first line of the planned Alta Velocidad Espanola
high- speed system opened between Madrid and Seville in April.
Other lines are under construction. France is building the TGV Nord from
Paris to Calais, a TGV interconnection by-passing Paris, and the TGV
Rhone-Alpes from Lyon to Valence. Germany is extending its high-speed lines
northwards to Hamburg and southwards to Munich. Italy is extending the
Rome-Florence Direttissima northwards to Milan and southwards to Naples.
Yet, almost by definition, the high-speed rail lines that have already been
built or commissioned are the most attractive - either because they fulfil
the greatest need or because they are the cheapest or easiest to construct.
A number of factors could impede progress on subsequent projects.
One obvious obstacle is geography. Mountains and seas, for example, are
extremely expensive to tunnel under: witness the Pounds 8bn-plus bill for
the Channel tunnel. And high-speed lines are highly unpopular when they pass
through densely-populated conurbations or areas of natural beauty, as France
is beginning to discover with its TGV extensions.
A second factor is finance. Even relatively straightforward high- speed
lines are not cheap to build. The greater the geographical difficulties, the
more the cost goes up. The planned high-speed link between London and the
Channel tunnel, for example, just 69 miles long, is expected to cost more
than Pounds 4bn because of the need to make it environmentally acceptable to
the people of Kent.
A third factor is the so-called frontier effect. Traffic flows tend to be
higher within countries than between them, so while there may be a financial
case for a high-speed line between two cities in the same country, the case
for extending the same line over the border often does not stack up.
That said, there are commitments to building at least some of the lines
needed to complete the European network.
France has adopted a TGV master plan paving the way for 16 projects
involving 4,700km of new lines. These include a new TGV line from Paris to
Calais via Amiens; an extension of the TGV Atlantique to Bordeaux and
Toulouse; extensions of the TGV Sud-Est to the Spanish border and to Nice;
and a new line, the TGV Est, from Paris to Strasbourg.
Germany faces pressure to build a high-speed line from Hanover to Berlin
following east-west unification, though there are no firm plans yet.
Britain has promised to build a line from London to the Channel tunnel,
though there are still no indications as to who is to pay for it or when it
will be built.
Belgium is to build a high-speed line linking Brussels with France's TGV
Nord at Lille, and continuing beyond Brussels to Liege.
Italy is planning a high-speed line between Turin and Venice and a line from
Milan to Genoa. It is also studying the feasibility of a line from Turin to
Lyon in France, plugging into the TGV.
Spain may build a high- speed Madrid-Barcelona line, though no firm plans
exist.
Europe, then, is looking at a considerable expansion of its high-speed rail
network: but it may not take place on quite the scale envisaged by the EC.
Without an agreement to set up a substantial EC transport infrastructure
fund, most of the so-called missing links in the network seem destined to
remain exactly that: missing. And while large, thinly-populated countries
(eg France) may find the benefits of high-speed lines outweigh the costs,
smaller and more densely populated ones (eg Britain) may prefer to upgrade
existing lines.

FT  18 JUN 92 / Survey of European Building &amp; Construction (10): In the
doldrums - The French outlook
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARBARA CASASSUS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FRENCH economy may be picking up steam, but the building and
construction industry is still struggling and is not expected to start
reviving until mid-1993.
Some analysts are forecasting a decline in volume of property construction
and public works of between 2 and 4 per cent between 1991 and 1992, with new
housing and office building plunging particularly sharply. 'The private
sector does not want to invest in property', laments a Paris-based analyst.
One clear indicator of the gloom ahead is that cement production in France
is forecast to drop by 5 per cent. France exports and imports virtually no
cement.
Earlier this month, Mr Jean-Louis Bianco, the housing minister, gave details
of a plan to bolster building and public works, but analysts say it is not
enough to pull the sector out of the doldrums.
A new housing loan scheme and assorted tax breaks are aimed to boost housing
starts from the projected 290,000 this year to at least 300,000, adding a
total of 35,000 by the end of next year. By the end of May, the forecast of
290,000 was already looking over-optimistic.
Although not as pessimistic as some, the country's building federation, or
Federation Nationale du Batiment (FNB) says that the first four months of
this year suggest that turnover for residential and commercial property
construction will shrink by 1 per cent this year.
This compares with a forecast growth in gross domestic product of more than
2 per cent for the year, and represents the biggest gap between the two
since 1984. If the government wants the sector to recover, it will have to
narrow the differentials in yields on property and securities, says an FNB
official.
The outlook is not quite as grim for public works. The public works
federation, or Federation Nationale des Travaux Publics, was very worried
when the 1992 public spending programme was unveiled in December. But since
then, an extra FFr1.2bn has been allocated for new motorways, increasing the
networks by a total of 250 kilometres.
A further FFr1bn has been earmarked for other infrastructure and public
transport, which the government has promised will not be taken out of other
allocations. Even so, the federation is betting only on 2.5 per cent growth
in turnover in 1992, down from 3 per cent in 1991.
Now that France has reached the bottom of the economic cycle, analysts
expect the restructuring of the sector to accelerate for building works. It
has been slow so far. The five 'majors' accounted for 11 per cent of
building in 1990, only 1.4 per cent more than in 1987.
Concentration has come mainly through the takeover by large groups of
medium-sized rather than small enterprises, and is predicted to continue
that way. 'Large groups sub-contract work to small local firms in order to
keep their payroll down, which is their biggest operating cost,' says one
analyst. 'Medium firms could be in difficulty in the months ahead, and may
be bought up cheaply by the majors.'
The public works sector, which is more capital-intensive, is more
concentrated. In 1990, the majors held 26 per cent of the market and small
firms only 5 per cent. About 120 companies with more than 200 employees
accounted for the rest.
An exception to the pattern of medium-sized firms being the takeover targets
was the FFr4.5bn takeover of Societe Auxiliaire d'Entreprises (SAE) by
competitor Fougerolle in the spring. This created a group with a turnover of
about FFr31bn in building and construction last year, ranking Groupe
SAE-Fougerolle fourth among the majors after Bouygues and Societe Generale
d'Entreprises (SGE), a subsidiary of Compagnie Generale des Eaux, and
Lyonnaise des Eaux-Dumez.
The financial position of most of the large groups is healthier than 10
years ago, even though their net margin ranges from 1 per cent for
Spie-Batignolles to only 3 per cent for Fougerolle. Spie-Batignolles
reported a net loss of FFr950m last year and analysts insist it will have to
form a link-up sooner or later. Bouygues has attempted a takeover more than
once, but the price has never been right.
Brightening the picture for the 'majors' is the fact that most are active
internationally. Orders are expanding overseas and margins are more generous
than on the domestic market, particularly in eastern Europe, Spain and Asia.

FT  18 JUN 92 / Survey of European Building &amp; Construction (11): The bubble
that burst - The problems of the Nordic region's industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PRESENT recession afflicting most of the Nordic region's construction
sector looks set to continue until the middle of the 1990s. Indeed, over the
next two years a drop of 30 per cent is expected in Swedish residential
property investment, the severest decline the country has seen in its
building industry since before the Second World War.
It marks quite a contrast with the booming 1980s when construction and real
estate were the focus for a speculative but lengthy expansion, based on
rocketing property values and frenetic demand across Scandinavia.
The construction bubble really burst in the fourth quarter of 1990 but its
negative after-effects continue to blight much of the region in the shape of
bad loans to most of the commercial banks, spiralling bankruptcies of many
small and medium-sized real estate and property companies and a sharp
contraction in new construction projects.
Mr Lars-Ove Hakansson, chief executive of Skanska, the largest construction
and real estate company in the Nordic area, warned his shareholders this
spring that the Swedish building industry would have to live with the
adverse market situation for another three to four years, just as Norway
took a long time to adjust after its economic crisis in 1986. To make
matters worse, he also suggested the Swedish real estate market faced five
more difficult years ahead.
His pessimism is shared by the Swedish government. Its recently published
medium-term economic survey forecast a sharp slump in residential
construction investment of -16.5 per cent this year and a further -15.5 per
cent in 1993.
The trouble is that the construction industry is not just suffering from a
cyclical downturn but the consequences of an underlying structural change
that is transforming the property market across the Nordic region. All the
governments plan to reduce the high levels of subsidisation that have
distorted the building sector as it adapts to the 19-nation European
Economic Area that comes into force next January.
The Swedish government in particular is seeking to free the property sector
from controls that have tended to distort free market forces. The reform of
corporate taxation is making mortgage financing of property investment less
advantageous while a sharp rise in value-added tax on housing transactions
from 12.87 to 25 per cent has added to cost burdens. An investment grant
specifically aimed at construction has been abolished.
The overdue deregulation of the Nordic region's over-protected construction
industry seems unlikely to stimulate any increase in business activity. On
the contrary, it looks as though it could dampen already weak demand still
further. Moreover, under the agreed rules of the EEA the Nordic countries
will have to accept the principle of open tendering for construction
contracts and this looks set to increase competition at a time when there
are limited business opportunities.
However, if the recession in housing and commercial real estate persists
until 1994-1995, that does not mean there will be a complete stagnation in
the Nordic construction industry. Even governments that are determined to
maintain tight control over public expenditure programmes seem prepared to
encourage selective investment projects to improve the infrastructure, most
notably through the construction of better roads and railways.
The scheme to build a road and rail bridge over the waters of the Oresund
between Denmark and Sweden should provide plenty of opportunities for Nordic
companies in the next few years just as the Great Belt construction scheme
in Denmark which is expected to link Zealand with the island of Funen by
1997 has given a boost to several western European building contractors, not
just from the Nordic region.
But as Mr Hakansson warned recently, a doubling of transportation
infrastructure investments to SKr8-10bn a year will 'only offset a small
fraction of the shortfall in housing and commercial real estate
construction'.
However, for Skanska and other large companies the recession has provided
the opportunity to become more cost-conscious, to strengthen marketing
operations and improve efficiency. When the upturn comes, they will be in a
better position to compete successfully in what will be a more global and
open market.

FT  18 JUN 92 / Survey of European Building &amp; Construction (8): Expertise
could boost orders for specialists - Dutch housebuilders may be hit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RONALD VAN DE KROL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LIKE THE Dutch economy as a whole, the construction industry in the
Netherlands is now facing a period of slower growth after enjoying a surge
in business in the mid to late 1980s. The downturn for builders, however, is
projected to be worse than for the economy's own fortunes.
Housebuilders are expected to experience the greatest contraction in their
segment of the market in the years ahead, while specialists in road, soil
and marine construction appear to have more favourable prospects, provided
that big infrastructure projects such as the expansion of the port of
Rotterdam and the Dutch railway network proceed as planned.
Abroad, the Dutch will remain important players in hydraulic engineering,
bridge-building and dredging, all three areas in which the Netherlands has
become expert through its own struggle against the sea. For example, the
country's largest builder, Hollandsche Beton Groep (HBG), is tipped to
benefit from orders flowing from Hong Kong's airport project.
HBG has also recently become the first Dutch builder to acquire a major
German construction company. Its new subsidiary, Raulf Bau, which has annual
turnover of around DM250m, gives the Dutch company a foothold in the former
east Germany through two construction companies acquired by Raulf shortly
before its own takeover.
Other internationally-active Dutch builders such as Wilma and Kondor Wessels
are also stepping up their involvement in German construction projects to
benefit from faster rates of growth in the Netherlands' eastern neighbour.
At home, the overall volume of construction is expected to dip in 1992 and
then resume a modest upwards trend in the years until 1996. According to the
construction industry research institute EIB (Economisch Instituut voor de
Bouwnijverheid), the industry as a whole will, on average, post annual
growth of 0.3 per cent in the period 1989-1996.
The EIB notes that although the expected growth rate for the early 1990s is
relatively small, the Dutch construction industry entered the decade at an
historically high level. In fact, even if average annual growth fails to
exceed 0.3 per cent, the early 1990s are expected to produce the highest
average volume of construction since 1970, as measured by 1987 prices.
Housing, however, is an exception. According to the EIB, this sector could
face an annual average decline of 3.9 per cent by 1996, reflecting the cuts
in government money for the subsidised housing sector as well as a slowdown
in the growth of new households. The research institute forecasts that the
number of housing units built with the help of state subsidies will plummet
to just 41,000 in 1996 from 61,000 in 1990.
By contrast, the non-housing sector - the industry's largest - will see an
0.8 per cent annual rate of growth, well below the 3.9 per cent forecast for
the soil, marine and road sector.
Besides projects in the Rotterdam port and the expected construction of a
high-speed 'TGV' train line from Brussels to Amsterdam, the Dutch
construction industry also looks forward to the launch of Amsterdam's urban
development project on the banks of the 'IJ' waterway later in the 1990s.
Bureaucracy and outstanding financial problems make it difficult to predict
a date for construction to begin.
Dutch builders also face the prospects of fines from the European Commission
because of the way the industry deals with tenders. In February, the EC
imposed fines of Ecu22.5m on the industry for running what Brussels calls a
cartel. The Dutch, who deny price-fixing, have appealed and await a court
ruling.
The EC's wrath is directed at the way 7,000 Dutch building companies (and,
to a lesser extent, foreign builders who work in the Netherlands) decide
among themselves which company should be chosen as the designated bidder for
a specific building project.
As part of the system, which accords with Dutch law, the various
construction firms hold a meeting to reveal the level of the bids they have
submitted. One of them is then selected to negotiate with the commissioning
company.
The ultimate price paid for the construction project will include the costs
which the other companies incurred in drawing up their bids. These costs are
reimbursed to the unsuccessful bidders.
The EC says that the system adds 3 per cent to construction prices in the
Netherlands. The industry disputes this, saying that building prices and
profit margins are among the lowest in Europe. It also argues that the
Netherlands open system is preferable to deals in 'smoky back rooms' which
it says occur in other countries.

FT  18 JUN 92 / Survey of European Building &amp; Construction (6): The pain may
linger - The British market remains depressed
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   THE OFFICE tower at Canary Wharf
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Britain's tallest building at 800 ft - dominates the skyline of east London.
It stands as a massive monument to the failure of the British commercial
property market in the late 1980s.
The failure of the Canary Wharf project and the collapse of its developer,
Olympia &amp; York owned by the Reichmann family, mirrors the misery which has
been felt by hundreds of British construction companies and building
material suppliers.
Just as Centre Point, an office block which remained empty for many years in
London's West End, became a symbol of the 1970s property market collapse, so
the Canary Wharf tower remains a painful reminder of the precarious nature
of speculative development.
The pain looks like lingering. Property investors are unlikely to begin new
projects while newly-completed office blocks continue to struggle to find
tenants.
This will hit workloads and depress profitability. Intense competition for a
diminishing number of potential contracts has meant that profit margins have
fallen sharply for other types of construction work.
Contractors which have already cut bids for work as low as possible and
still failed to win jobs say that some companies appear to be taking
contracts at zero margin or even at a loss. These companies need to keep
cash coming in to pay interest payments on borrowings which were raised
during the mid to late 1980s when the commercial and residential property
markets were at their height.
According to a report by the National Economic Develop- ment Office, about
33m sq ft of office space was either empty or available for letting in
London at the end of last year. This represented 16 per cent of the total
office space in Britain's biggest commercial market and would take six years
to occupy at normal rates of take-up.
So much space remains empty in London, including large amounts at Canary
Wharf, that it could be several years before Britain's biggest commercial
property market returns to anything like normality.
The effect on contractors and suppliers has been to reduce workloads while
those companies which undertook speculative residential and commercial
developments saw the value of their investments fall steeply as the cost of
the money borrowed to build them went up.
Even such companies as Wimpey, Barratt, Costain and Tarmac have been
required to make substantial provisions, running into hundreds of millions
of pounds, to reflect falls in residential and commercial land and property
values since the markets peaked in 1988-89. Dividends have either been cut
or have been paid only from reserves.
There should be no further write-downs unless there is a further dip in
property values. Nevertheless, the outlook for the British construction
market remains very depressed - despite signs that a slow thaw may be
starting in the housing market.
Builders and estate agents say that more people have recently expressed
interest in making purchases and visiting houses for sale, but to persuade
them to put hard cash on the table remains very difficult.
There is often a long lag between expressions of interest and the actual
completion of a sale. Purchases often fall down at the last minute and
builders say they still have to offer substantial sales incentives in order
to complete deals. They are reluctant to talk of the beginnings of a
recovery, particularly as house purchases would normally be expected to rise
in the spring.
Nonetheless, companies such as Wimpey, the country's second largest
housebuilder, say that sales have been running at about 10 per cent higher
this year compared with the corresponding period last year.
Builders remain concerned at margins. One of Britain's biggest construction
groups which has a medium-sized housebuilding subsidiary operating mainly in
southern England says that it is continuing to sell homes at little or no
profit after taking into account interest charges and other overheads.
The company is still working through high cost land bought during the late
1980s when house prices were up to 20 per cent higher in south-east England.
Average UK house prices have continued to fall during the first half of this
year and builders do not expect prices to show any real increase before
1983. Even then, prices may rise only slowly. There is longer-term concern
that Britain's membership of the European exchange rate mechanism will
result in slower growth in house prices in future as a result of lower
general inflation rates.
Work for housing associations, however, has increased sharply as public and
private sector finance available to associations has risen substantially.
The only other glimmer of light in an otherwise gloomy outlook for the
sector has been the increased spending by the recently privatised water and
power companies which have been catching up with their capital investment,
neglected when they were under public ownership.
Water companies, in particular, have been spending heavily, to the benefit
of tunnelling companies. Competition among contractors, seeking to replace
work lost in other areas of construction, has meant that margins even for
water and sewerage projects have not been as high as might have been
expected.
Euro Construct, an organisation representing European construction research
agencies and economic forecasting bodies, is expected to forecast today that
construction output in the UK will fall by about 5 per cent this year. This
would follow a 9 per cent fall last year.
The biggest fall is likely to occur in commercial building, mainly offices
and shops, where output could decline by more than a fifth this year.
Construction of factories and warehouses is also likely to decline as
industrial companies continue to hold back from making new investment until
they can gauge the strength of the recovery more clearly.
The outlook for private industrial work is difficult to determine now that
this sector includes water and power companies. Construction of the Channel
Tunnel, also classed as private industrial work in Environment Department
statistics, is likely to slow however as the building phase of the project
is completed.
Contractors have also been disappointed that the big increase in road
spending by the government at the end of the 1980s has not produced a
greater flow of orders. Margins for road work are also depressed, along with
much of the rest of construction work.
Profits of British construction and building material companies are likely
to remain under pressure this year, even though there are unlikely to be any
further property write-downs. There is unlikely to be any substantial bounce
back next year, with construction output forecast to remain relatively flat
in 1993.

FT  18 JUN 92 / Survey of European Building &amp; Construction (7): Applying the
brakes - Spain has gone from frenzy to second gear
</HEADLINE>

   By TOM BURNS

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SPAIN'S CONSTRUCTION industry fell to its nadir just when it appeared to be
at an all-time frenzy.
In April the paint was still drying on the battery of new buildings at Expo
'92, the world exhibition that opened that month in Seville and signposts
were still going up on the 70 kilometres worth of city ring roads that had
been built for the event. In Barcelona, where the Olympic games will be
staged next month, a final sprint was on to complete stadiums, more
expressways and a custom-built village to accommodate the athletes.
Then, Seopan, the construction industry's association, delivered the bad
news. Its newsletter said that - though it had little data to go on so far
this year - everything indicated an 'alarming' mid-term future for its
members.
Cement consumption in January had dropped by 12 per cent against the first
month of last year and construction jobs had fallen by 10 per cent in the
first quarter.
The most worrying statistic of all was that official tenders in the first
two months of this year were 58 per cent down on the same period in 1991,
totalling Pta108.9bn (Pounds 59.67m). It was the worst two opening months
for the past five years.
Mr Leonor Aresti, an analyst at Madrid brokers FG Inversiones Bursatiles,
believes the construction sector will find the going very tough until 1993
as the depressed market, illustrated by the collapse of tenders, works its
way through the balance sheets with an 18-month time lag.
'Tenders started coming down in the second half of last year' he says, 'and
they will not begin to rally until the second half of this year.'
The construction companies are already feeling the pinch.
The Public Works Ministry, a notorious late payer in an administration that
is not noted for the urgency with which it settles its accounts, has
traditionally taken between five and six months to pay its contractors. Now
the process is taking between eight and nine months and officials are
hinting that delays might get longer still.
Overall money owed to the sector is independently calculated at Pta700bn.
The big companies can survive - the administration will pay in the end - but
many of the small ones are in trouble. Small construction firms, which make
their living from sub-contracts and which borrowed heavily during the boom
years of the late 1980s, are the last in line to receive payments.
The Spanish economy has changed down fast from overdrive to second gear. It
has braked so sharply that the effect on some sectors, such as construction,
is more punitive than it would be in economies that had never known such
high growth in the first place.
GDP, the gross domestic product, grew at an average 5.2 per cent in 1986-89.
In 1990 growth was down to 3.6 per cent and last year it slowed further to
2.4 per cent. Growth this year is expected to be barely above the 2 per cent
mark. Internal demand stood at 2.9 per cent last year, nearly two full
points down on 1990.
The Finance Ministry has in the meantime unveiled a convergence plan, which
aims at righting economic imbalances and so have Spain ready to meet the
Maastricht summit's criteria for Economic and Monetary Union within Europe
in 1997. The bad news for the construction sector is that under the plan the
budget deficit, which currently stands at 4.4 per cent of GDP, will be
reduced annually by 0.5 per cent over the next five years.
If there is a silver lining for the Spanish building industry, it may be
found in government statements which indicate continued efforts to improve
the nation's infrastructure.
Finance Ministry officials say money will be saved on health and social
security benefits but will continue to spent on education, on job training
and on infrastructure, the three main areas where there is a clear
competitive deficit with the richer EC economies.
The investment programme that has now been completed with Seville's Expo '92
and the Barcelona Olympics has brought into sharp focus the pressing need
for continued investment elsewhere. Thus Seville and Barcelona have revamped
airports but Madrid's airport is woefully deficient; Seville now has a high
speed train link with Madrid, but Madrid urgently requires one with
Barcelona; there are four-lane highways linking Barcelona, Madrid and
Seville but great swathes of these are already near saturation point.
The Finance Ministry has said although the budget deficit will be cut,
investment in infrastructure will go up by as much as 5 per cent a year
until 1997. Unfortunately, the increase is to a large extent dependent on EC
structural funds, the amounts of which are in doubt, and on private sector
financing which so far has not been forthcoming. The construction sector is
keeping its fingers crossed.

FT  18 JUN 92 / Survey of European Building &amp; Construction (4): The Germans
are laughing - The upswing is set to continue
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE PRESIDENT of the German building industry federation, HDB, tried hard to
reflect the mood of gloomy caution prevailing in German business circles,
but an uncontrollable smile kept breaking out and spoilt the effect. Mr
Hermann Becker and his members have reasons to be cheerful.
Reviewing the industry's prospects for the current year recently, he
forecast falling volume sales, and groaned at the impact of government
spending cuts, record interest rates, ballooning land prices and
over-generous pay settlements. Business in the east was 'stuttering', he
said.
But on the bottom line, with expected real growth in west German
construction this year of up to 3 per cent, and 17 per cent in the east, the
sector is outperforming all other industries. And the upswing seems likely
to continue.
Overall 1992 economic growth in the west is forecast at just 1 per cent, and
around 10 per cent in the east. With all-German investment of DM381bn
planned for this year, the country will account for almost 30 per cent of
total European Community investment in building.
'The overall weakness in business conditions has slowed the development in
construction, but it cannot stop it,' Mr Becker said.
The motor in the west is the pent-up and growing demand for housing. Back in
1987 the authorities were shocked to discover that west Germany needed 1m
new homes. In 1990, after unification, they found they needed to refurbish
or rebuild virtually the entire eastern housing stock. Later they were
confronted with floods of ethnic Germans returning 'home' from eastern
Europe.
Orders for housing in the west alone rose 19 per cent in the first two
months of this year. Completions in Bavaria rose almost 16 per cent in the
first quarter. Overall, Mr Becker said, the industry would complete 350,000
houses and apartments this year, compared with 314,000 in 1991.
Public sector orders, meanwhile, rose only 0.5 per cent in the first two
months, and local authority building plans suggest a 2 per cent overall
decline. The government is committed to limiting real public spending growth
to 2.5 per cent a year, in effect a cap. But it is also pledged to giving
east Germans living standards that are comparable with those in the west as
quickly as possible.
In practical terms, this means a crash programme to prevent impatient
skilled and educated 'Ossi' workers from uprooting themselves, moving west,
and wrecking Bonn's efforts to build a balanced, unified economy and
society.
In cash terms, according to the respected Ifo research institute in Munich,
this means spending DM2,400bn by the year 2005. A study prepared for the HDB
suggests 40 per cent of the total will be needed for housing, 22 per cent
for the economic infrastructure - items such as energy supply - 15 per cent
for road and rail links, and 6 per cent for drains, waterworks and other
environmental projects.
This presents the construction industry with a challenge - increasing output
in the east by 15 per cent annually for 15 years - which many see as
impossible.
So far this year, as investors have registered the loss of the early
'unification dividends' and the cooling of the boom, German construction
stocks have tended to be marked down or put on 'hold' in analysts'
recommendations.
But there are still a few companies in Germany this year where earnings per
share are expected to grow at the rates forecast for builders such as
Bilfinger &amp; Berger (24 per cent) or even Strabag, exposed to public spending
cuts by its dependence on road construction and other public sector
contracts, and still forecast to show a 14 per cent rise.
And while the industry contemplates the daunting panorama of order prospects
 -reaching far beyond the former GDR and into Czechoslovakia, Poland,
Hungary and into the former Soviet Union - it also confronts the task of
restructuring itself, the better to compete at international level.
German industry is renowned for its plethora of small and medium-sized
concerns which comprise the so-called Mittelstand, and construction is no
exception. Of the 65,000 building companies registered in the west, only
11,000 employ more than 20 people.
According to HDB, the advantages of scale show up in items like personnel
costs - 35 per cent of the value of production in a company with more than
500 employees and 41 per cent in one with 20 to 50. Costs of materials to
the larger operators are only two-thirds of those carried by the smaller
groups.
The trend towards concentration is gathering pace accordingly. In early May,
for example, Walter Bau, led by Mr Ignaz Bau, a former apprentice
bricklayer, wound up a rapid-fire series of acquisitions when it won control
of Munich-based Dywidag. With an extra DM3.7bn in sales, the company was
catapulted to a close second place in the German big league and its annual
turnover came within DM500m of Phillip Holzmann's DM11bn.

FT  18 JUN 92 / Survey of European Building &amp; Construction (5): Contracts
lead to corruption - Italian industry's image has been tarnished by
political scandals
</HEADLINE>

   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THESE ARE testing times for Italy's construction industry. Already hard
pressed by difficult economic conditions, the industry has recently come
under fire after disclosures of corruption in public contracts.
Earlier this year Milan magistrates, investigating irregularities in major
projects, dented the construction industry's reputation when they ordered
the arrest of senior executives of several construction companies, along
with local politicians.
To counteract the damage to the industry's image, the board of ANCE, the
national building contractors' association, met last month to discuss the
Milan kickback scandal. Pointing an accusing finger at increasing
delinquency in Italian society generally, ANCE put much of the blame for
corruption on the progressive spread of political influence.
Recognising the high potential for corruption in the construction industry,
the association called for clearer separation between politics and public
administration and for greater transparency in awarding contracts. 'The
construction industry hopes that not only will there be legal outcomes to
the present cases, but that there will also be a reversal of the pollution
in relations between the public authorities and firms.'
Figures from ANCE show that the biggest public spenders are the ANAS
highways authority (13.9 per cent of total public sector business of
L31,461bn last year), the state itself (13.4 per cent), the southern
development agency Agensud (11.8 per cent), the FS state railways (9 per
cent) and the ENEL state electricity corporation (7.4 per cent). The
authorities in Italy's many provinces and communes collectively accounted
for 35.3 per cent of public sector construction business in 1991.
Though public sector works accounted for only 21.7 per cent of total
investment in construction last year - down from 1990's figure of 22.5 per
cent - the absolute value nevertheless represented an appetising market for
Italy's work-hungry contractors.
If ANCE's forecasts are correct, however, they will be sharing a smaller
cake in 1992. The association published figures earlier this year that point
to an expected 3.9 per cent fall in the real value of public sector
construction. Added to the 3.5 per cent real decline between 1990 and 1991,
this will completely erode the growth that occurred between 1986 and 1990.
But the outturn may be worse, ANCE officials now admit. As the recent
government decision to freeze all non-essential work until October
highlights, part of the solution to the problem of Italy's deficit-wracked
public sector finances is likely to be a sharp brake on investment.
Moreover, the policy of tightening the purse-strings may continue until the
mid-1990s as the government attempts to put the accounts in order.
Fortunately for Italy's contractors, there are some areas of light. While
local authorities may expect a sharp reining back, ENEL's power station
projects should not be affected. And ANCE is optimistic that work on Italy's
TAV high-speed railway project will be under way before the end of the year.
The contractors' association notes that the TAV's mixed public-private
sector financing and management formula offers an innovative solution.
With the past two years recording significant falls in the real value of
investment in public sector construction, and a short to medium term that is
full of imponderables, companies cannot rely on work from this segment of
the market.
Indeed, as ANCE officials note, the health of its membership depends on
private sector business. And, though registering a significant slowdown, the
volume of private sector construction nevertheless continued to grow last
year.
ANCE's figures record L73,762bn of total housing investment last year (new
and improvements to existing stock), compared with L67,489bn in 1990. This
represented a volume increase of 1.2 per cent, a modest performance when set
against real growth figures of 2.4 and 1.7 per cent for 1988-89 and
1989-1990 respectively.
Non-residential private sector construction provided business worth
L39,730bn last year. Notwithstanding the downturn in the Italian economy,
this was 1 per cent higher in real terms than in 1990. It represented,
however, the end of strong upward trend. Real growth of less than 4 per cent
had been recorded only twice since 1985: 1.6 per cent in 1986-87 and 3.8 per
cent in 1987-88.
ANCE's 20,000 member firms, whose payrolls account for about half of the 1m
workers employed in the Italian construction industry, are facing a
difficult period. Growth in private sector work is not expected to
compensate for this year's sharp decline in public sector business.
'The economy is stagnant, and private sector construction activity reflects
this. The recessionary climate is deterring industrial and commercial
concerns from investment. Housebuilding has also slowed,' says an ANCE
official. Indeed, the association's forecasts point to zero growth in the
construction of new residential property this year.
With ANCE expecting a 0.4 per cent downturn in the real volume of total
public and private sector construction work this year, the first negative
outturn since 1987, what prospects do foreign markets offer? Performance
over the past decade, during which Italian contractors have registered a 75
per cent drop in business abroad, suggests that markets beyond Italian
borders, reachable only by the largest firms, will not ameliorate the pain
being felt at home.

FT  18 JUN 92 / Survey of European Building &amp; Construction (2): Shift to the
east - Cross-border links
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR

<TEXT>
THE DECISION to remove barriers to free trade between European Community
countries at the end of this year has prompted a spate of cross-border
mergers and stakes among European contractors.
French and German companies have been some of the biggest spenders. But
recently, German and French sights have been more focused on making
acquisitions and stake-building in former communist countries of eastern and
central Europe.
British contractors, faced with a big upsurge in work in the UK in the
1980s, were slow off the mark to make cross-border purchases. They also
faced difficulties in finding opportunities in the more closed German and
French markets. But latterly, British construction companies have stepped up
their attempts to gain a foothold in continental European markets.
Spanish companies have also been making cross-border purchases. Two of
Spain's biggest civil engineering groups, Cubiertas and Entrecanales, last
summer paid Pounds 24m for a 21.5 per cent stake in Lilley, the
Glasgow-based construction group.
The stake was acquired by Tibest Tres, a company jointly owned by the two
Spanish contractors. Lilley, in return, paid Pounds 8.35m to acquire 2 per
cent of Cubiertas, a public works specialist. Lilley and its Spanish
partners are currently bidding jointly to build part of the Pounds 1.7bn
Jubilee underground line extension in London.
The desire to make cross-border acquisitions has been driven as much the
advent of the EC single market as by the need for contractors to find new
work opportunities and to protect themselves from cyclical downturns in
domestic markets.
In the latest recession construction markets in continental Europe held up
for longer and much better than in the UK and US where output has fallen
steeply since the late 1980s.
But not every acquisition has been a success. Some German and French
companies have had a lean time of it since buying into British groups. Their
investments have fallen sharply in value while there is little evidence that
these strategic alliances have led to contract opportunities.
Thus Hochtief, the west German contractor, acquired a 25 per cent stake in
Rush &amp; Tompkins only to see the British construction and property company go
into receivership. Parts of its contracting business were then acquired by
Hochtief and Ballast Needham, a Dutch contractor bought by British Aerospace
in 1987.
Philipp Holzmann, of Germany, is typical of European contractors which have
acquired stakes in other EC companies in the hope that this would open the
door for more work. It owns outright or holds strategic stakes in Austrian,
British, Dutch, French and Spanish companies, including a 20 per cent stake
in Tilbury Douglas, the UK contractor and developer, which owns the former
Chrysler car factory at Linwood in Scotland.
Tilbury, Holzmann and Girozentrale, an Austrian bank, have formed a joint
venture to redevelop the Chrysler site. Tilbury separately has formed a
joint venture with Holzmann and Jotsa, a Spanish contractor of which
Holzmann owns 50 per cent to build a 370,000 sq ft industrial and office
development south of Madrid.
Mr Alan Cockshaw, chairman of Amec, the British construction and engineering
group, says companies which want to work in overseas markets need to have a
strong local base to stand any chance of winning profitable contracts.
Companies operating in overseas markets without local knowledge and
experience run the risk of being 'ripped off', he says.
Amec recently bought a 50 per cent stake in Kittelberger, a German building
and civil engineering group. It also holds a 20 per cent stake in Serete,
France's leading independent design engineering and construction management
group.
Companies wishing to gain a local presence in European markets have three
routes to choose from:
Forming individual joint ventures with local companies on a
project-by-project basis. This involves no long-term financial commitment
but does not generate any extra business other than the job in hand.
Acquiring an existing business outright. This can be costly and difficult.
Contractors rely on the local knowledge and skills of their staff. These may
leave if their company is subject to a contested bid from a foreign
predator.
Acquiring strategic stakes. This has been the favoured route of German and
French companies, with cross-holdings in each other to cement trading
relationships and as a defence against takeover bids.
British and Italian companies which dislike minority investments in
companies where they have no control have been mistrustful of this route.
And the complex share structures of German and French contractors have made
it hard for foreign companies to buy into these markets.
Shares of the big five German contractors - Holzmann, Hochtief, Bilfinger,
Strabag and Dywidag - are tightly held by each other or by banks. There are
large crossholdings among French contractors.
The British market, by comparison, is much more open. There are many
medium-sized contractors whose shares can be bought readily on the stock
market.
British companies, because of their vulnerability to takeover moves, have to
consider the impact on their share price of any acquisition which could
dilute profits in the short term. This makes it difficult for them to
justify overseas purchases where these appear to dilute rather than enhance
earnings. Continental companies, because of their ownership structure, can
take a longer-term view of acquisitions.
Attitudes, however, are changing. British contractors such as Amec and John
Brown, part of Trafalgar House, the construction, property and shipping
group, have bought stakes in continental European companies. Attention is
shifting eastwards as companies try to break into the construction-hungry
markets of Czechoslovakia and Hungary. Watch this space.

FT  18 JUN 92 / Survey of European Building &amp; Construction (3): Solid but
inevitable moves - Building Materials
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CONSOLIDATION of Europe's building materials market is far more advanced
than in the contracting sector.
The incidence of cross-border acquisitions, joint ventures and strategic
alliances is far greater among cement, glass, plasterboard, concrete and
roof tile producers than it is among contractors which operate in much more
fragmented domestic markets.
The prime reason for this is that a purchaser of a building materials
company is buying tangible assets whereas a contractor with no production
facilities is worth only the sum of the abilities of the people it employs.
So it is more risky to invest in a contractor whose key personnel can walk
away at any time, particularly after a contested bid, than put money into a
building materials producer whose key asset is clay or limestone reserves
that can be measured and valued.
The manufacture of high volume, low value building materials such as bricks,
cement and concrete tends naturally to consolidate among a small number of
large suppliers. These are able to make the best of a low margin business by
taking advantage of economies of scale.
That is particularly true in Britain where public companies can be bought up
through the Stock Exchange, unlike continental Europe where shares are more
tightly held and many companies privately owned. As a result, British
material companies have been able to build up large domestic positions.
Thus, in the cement industry there are only three large domestic suppliers:
Blue Circle, Rugby Portland and the Scandinavian-owned Castle Cement.
Until a few years ago, BPB Industries controlled more than 95 per cent of
the UK plasterboard market. Only recently has it faced strong competition in
its home market from Lafarge-Coppee of France and Knauf of Germany.
The British brick and concrete industries similarly are dominated by a
relatively small number of large and medium sized publicly quoted companies.
The result has been that British companies have been able to use their stock
market strength to build up a substantial asset base. They have then used
this as a springboard to carve out positions in the more fragmented
continental European markets.
Thus, BPB Industries is Europe's biggest plasterboard manufacturer; Redland
is the biggest roof tile producer; Pilkington is the largest glass supplier
and RMC the biggest ready-mix concrete producer.
Steetley, the British building materials group which has recently been
acquired by Redland after a bitter takeover bid, is the largest aggregates
company in France. Blue Circle has become one Europe's biggest manufacturers
of domestic heating equipment after the takeover of Compagnie Internationale
du Chauffage, a subsidiary of Nord Est of France and of Thermopanel,
Sweden's largest radiator producer.
Mr Charles Young, chief executive of Blue Circle's home products division,
said the purchases would make the group Europe's second largest supplier of
steel panel radiators behind Stelrad, part of MB-Caradon, the British
building products and packaging group.
The takeovers are the latest in a series of cross-border mergers involving
European heating companies. Last month, Robert Bosch, the German
conglomerate, succeeded in gaining control of Worcester Group, the British
central heating boiler maker, for which it had bid Pounds 71.8m. Earlier
this year Wolseley, the Midlands based engineering group, paid FFr931m
(Pounds 95m) for Brossette, a large French heating and plumbing supplier.
In 1990 Hepworth, the UK building materials and home products group, paid
Pounds 155m for Saunier Duval, the French boiler manufacturer.
These moves are typical of the consolidation that has been occurring in
European building material markets, particularly where products are too
bulky to be exported easily and competitive pricing can be vulnerable to
transport costs. In such cases, it is important that manufacturing plants
should be close to main markets. Companies with international aspirations
have little choice but to make acquisitions.
Most of the large European cement manufacturers have subsidiaries in other
Community countries. At the end of April, Italcementi, Italy's biggest
cement company, paid FFr6bn (Pounds 611m) for a controlling interest in
Ciments Francais, the second largest cement manufacturer in France.
A month earlier Calcestruzzi, the ready-mix concrete producing subsidiary of
the Italian Ferruzzi group, in a joint venture with the National Bank of
Greece took control of Heracles, one of the top two Greek cement
manufacturers.
The deals marked a new development in the battle for market share by
European cement manufacturers. Italian companies until now have stood aside
from making cross-border acquisitions, preferring to concentrate on
developing sales in a domestic market which boasts one of the world's
highest per capita consumption of cement. Nobody is quite sure what the
entry by Italcementi into the broader European market will herald.
The extent of takeovers and stakebuilding by large manufacturers in the
sector might suggest a highly competitive European market in which cement
prices might be expected to fall sharply as producers battle for market
share during times of recession.
In fact, cement prices in western Europe have proved surprisingly stable by
comparison with other basic building materials such as bricks and
plasterboard. Prices of plasterboard, for example, have been slashed in
Britain, France and Germany years as BPB Industries, Lafarge-Coppee and
Knauf have slugged it out in a bitter war for market share.
The absence of similar price-cutting by cement manufacturers and the
relatively low level of cement exports between European countries, even
where works are situated close to borders, has prompted a European Community
investigation into possible market sharing involving 76 companies including
Blue Circle of the UK, Holderbank of Switzerland, the world's largest cement
manufacturer and Lafarge-Coppee, the world's second largest manufacturer.
Manufacturers say that they have not colluded and that it would be suicidal
to indulge in a price war simply to satisfy European commissioners.
Nonetheless, companies risk being fined up to 10 per cent of their annual
turnover should the Commission prove that relationships between competitors
have become too cosy.

FT  18 JUN 92 / Survey of European Building &amp; Construction (1): Quietly
flows the workload - In most European countries activity is declining as the
recession bites. The outlook is likely to remain depressed, with little
improvement next year. But one glimmer of light is that infrastructure
spending is holding up

THE GOOD times have ended for European construction. The heavy earth movers,
tower cranes and mobile generators, which in the late 1980s gave some of
Europe's biggest cities the appearance of one vast building site, are being
switched off or dismantled.
Construction output is flagging in many countries as economic recession and
high interest rates have taken their toll on private investment in new
offices, shops and industrial plant.
Earnings of contractors and building material companies, as a result, are
under pressure as order books and profit margins have declined and
competition for a diminishing workload has increased.
Nowhere is this more apparent than in Britain where a steady flow of
developers, contractors and building material suppliers, including several
publicly quoted companies, have been forced into the hands of receivers.
Other companies which had embarked on speculative development have had to
make large provisions as the value of residential and commercial property
has fallen sharply. British construction groups may have come off worse in
the recession, but other markets are also suffering.
French contractors and building material companies which had expanded
aggressively into other European countries, making expensive cross-border
acquisitions, have been hit as these markets have gone into recession
leaving the former predators themselves weak and vulnerable to takeover.
The struggling Societe Auxiliare d'Entreprises was snapped up earlier this
year by rival French construction group Fougerolle in a deal worth FFr4.6bn
(Pounds 468m). Italcementi, Italy's largest cement company, recently bought
control of Ciments Francais, France's second biggest cement for FFr6bn
(Pounds 611m).
Ciments Francais, in particular, had been very active in making cross-border
acquisitions, leaving its balance sheet badly stretched as building output
across Europe, including France, moved into reverse. French cement sales are
forecast to fall by 5 per cent this year with domestic construction
activity, particularly in the private sector, expected to stagnate after
rising sharply in 1989 and 1990.
Construction output in most northern European markets is likely to stand
still or decline this year. Growth in Spain - until recently Europe's
fastest rising construction market - is expected to slow markedly as a
result of economic pressures and as big building programmes for the
Barcelona Olympics and the World Trade Fair at Seville come to an end.
Delegates attending today's conference in Helsinki held by Euro Construct,
which represents European construction research agencies and economic
forecasting bodies, will be told that the outlook for most European
contractors and building material companies is likely to remain depressed
with most countries expecting only a slight improvement in 1993.
Even Germany, Europe's strongest construction market, expects growth to slow
this year. The cost of integrating the former east German republic is
placing an increasing burden on the domestic economy. As a result, building
investment opportunities are being restricted in other parts of the country.
In some European cities, over-development of offices has left too many empty
buildings chasing too few tenants as companies have been shedding labour and
closing unwanted premises. Financial services, which had expanded rapidly
during the 1980s, has been particularly hit by the recession which has
curtailed the activity of industrial and commercial clients.
This is most apparent in London, one of Europe's biggest commercial property
markets which, at its height in the late 1980s, attracted developers from
all over the world, notably from Japan, Sweden and north America. Many of
these companies are now regretting their enthusiasm for the British market
as the value of their investments has plummeted.
Olympia &amp; York, the Canadian-based property developers owned by the
Reichmann family, has been brought to its knees by the failure of its
ill-fated Canary Wharf office development to attract sufficient tenants in
London's former Docklands. The decision to place the development into
administrative receivership threatens to cause further hardship to already
beleaguered sub-contractors which have been working on the development.
According to a report by the British National Economic Development Office
(NEDO), about 33m sq ft of office space was either empty or available for
occupation in London at the end of last year. This represented 16 per cent
of the total office space of the capital and NEDO said it would take six
years to occupy at normal letting rates of take-up.
As a result, commercial construction in the UK is expected to fall by about
a fifth this year and total construction by about 5 per cent.
Forecasts to be published at the Euro Construct conference are expected to
show falls in output, mostly of around 3 per cent, in the Netherlands,
Sweden and Switzerland. Output in France, Italy and Belgium is likely to
show little or no growth. In Germany and Spain growth rates are expected to
dip sharply.
There are some glimmers of light. Spending on infrastructure, particularly
on transport, is holding up much better than private investment in
residential and commercial property. The need for central and local
government to make economies has curtailed some of the more ambitious
proposals. Nonetheless, infrastructure spending is still rising in some
countries although at a slower rate than previously.
In the advanced economies of northern Europe there are plans to upgrade many
motorways and to reduce congestion and speed the flow of goods and services
by constructing high-speed rail links between main cities. If these plans go
ahead, the Channel Tunnel between Britain and France will be a crucial link
in a revitalised European rail network.
In southern Europe the demand is for new construction to provide the roads
and services which will allow rising economies to flourish. European
construction companies and building material companies seeking to take
advantage of new opportunities for work have been busy making acquisitions,
taking stakes and forging strategic alliances with local companies mostly in
Spain, but also in Greece and Portugal.
The decision to remove barriers to free trade between European Community
countries at the end of this year has also prompted a spate of cross-border
mergers and stakes between between European contractors. French and German
companies have been among the biggest spenders among contractors while
British building material companies have built up commanding positions in
the European roof tile, plasterboard, ready-mix concrete and glass
industries.
But not every acquisition has been a success. Some German and French
companies have had a lean time of it since they bought into British groups
at the height of the UK construction market in the late 1980s as the value
of their investments has fallen sharply.
Hochtief, the West German contractor, acquired a 25 per cent stake in Rush &amp;
Tompkins only to see the British construction and property company go into
receivership in 1990.
Companies such as Ciments Francais in France and Steetley, the British
building materials group which made expensive cross-border acquisitions in
the 1980s, have themselves been taken over. Steetley, which had become
France's biggest aggregates producer earlier this year, fell prey to
Redland, a rival British materials group and Europe's biggest roof tile
manufacturer, after a bitterly contested fight .
Latterly, European contractors and building materials companies have focused
on making acquisitions and stake building in the former communist countries
of eastern and central Europe. These have a big need for new construction if
their fledgling market-driven economies are to thrive.
The problem is not in identifying a need for new construction but in finding
the money to pay for it.

<TEXT>
GROUPE SUEZ, one of France's largest industrial and financial groups,
yesterday warned it would be hit by heavy property provisions this year,
writes Alice Rawsthorn in Paris.
Mr Gerard Worms, chairman, told the annual meeting it planned to buy out
minority shareholders in the group's Compagnie Industrielle subsidiary.
He said the economic environment remained 'unstable' and that Suez was
having trouble in the property and small business sectors. Its shares
slipped FFr11.80 to FFr302.20 on the announcement.
Mr Worms did not specify the likely level of Suez' provisions for 1992.
However Mr Patrick Ponsolle, managing director, said there was 'a risk' that
Suez would be forced to make a similar level of property provisions as in
1991, when the total was more than FFr1.2bn (Dollars 227m).
Meanwhile, Suez is continuing the strategy of tidying up its investment
portfolio by buying out the minority investors that hold 3.8 per cent of
Industrielle's shares. It is offering 11 shares in Victoire, an insurance
company that it controls, for two Industrielle shares.
Suez controls Industrielle with a 50.1 per cent holding. Union des
Assurances de Paris (UAP), its dual shareholder, has 46.1 per cent. UAP,
which has been locked in negotiations with Suez to swap some of its Victoire
shares for part of Colonia, a German insurer controlled by Victoire, has
agreed to the proposed buy-out.

Deutsche Aerospace (DASA), the aerospace unit of Daimler-Benz, and Alenia,
the Italian aerospace group, have formed a joint venture, Eurocolumbus
Raumfahrtgesellschaft, to prepare for the European space laboratory,
Columbus, Reuter reports from Berlin.
Mr Juergen Schrempp, DASA management board chairman, said the venture would
create the industrial conditions for the space station. He called on
politicians to carry through the Dollars 5.3bn Columbus project.
Eurocolumbus will be based in Bremen and have a branch in Torino, Italy.
DASA's orbital infrastructure division, ERNO Raumfarhttechnik, will own 60
per cent of Eurocolumbus. Alenia's stake will be owned through its Alenia
Spazio unit.
France's Matra Marconi Space, a unit of defence and transport group, Matra,
is expected to join the venture later. The venture will initially have 150
employees, who will be transferred from the parent companies.
*****
Swissair is to implement further cost-cutting measures, including the
elimination of 400 administrative jobs. Mr Otto Loepfe, president, said the
move followed 'worldwide fare erosion', especially over the north Atlantic,
AP-DJ reports from Zurich.
Mr Loepfe reportedly told employees: 'We are going to have to face up to
some lean times ahead. And it is the ones in the best shape that are going
to come through.'
Mentioning its existing cost-savings programme, dubbed 'Move,' the airline
said it was taking 'additional steps to enhance its competitive edge'. The
Move programme measures 'are to be further developed and implemented at an
accelerated pace'.

RIVAL Czech and Slovak leaders reached basic agreement yesterday on forming
a new government, but remained deadlocked on how to prevent Czechoslovakia
splitting apart, Reuter reports from Prague.
'The short-term goal is to assure the functioning of the federal government
as soon as possible, and we've agreed on its basic structure,' said Mr
Vaclav Klaus, finance minister, after talks with Mr Vladimir Meciar, the
Slovak leader.
Neither Mr Klaus nor Mr Meciar, head of the Movement for a Democratic
Slovakia (HZDS), which wants to transform Czechoslovakia into a loose
confederation of two sovereign republics, named ministers in the new
government.
But Mr Klaus, chairman of the Civic Democratic Party, said he would stand
for the post of premier of the Czech republic, rather than become federal
prime minister. 'We do not put much faith in the functioning nature of the
state we are now constructing,' he said.
Mr Meciar said the new government had to function as a confederal body, with
most powers residing in the two individual republics, which he wants to have
their own independent international status.

FT  18 JUN 92 / UK urges military role for the WEU
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT MAUTHNER, Diplomatic Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN called yesterday for the nine-nation Western European Union to be
given a genuine military capacity, in line with last year's Maastricht
agreement that the WEU should be the vehicle for developing European
defence.
Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the British defence secretary, said in an article ahead
of tomorrow's meeting of WEU foreign and defence ministers outside Bonn that
all members should make available a wide range of their Nato and national
assets for use by the WEU.
Such an approach had the advantage of avoiding the creation of separate
standing forces, which no member state could afford. It also meant that the
WEU would have a variety of forces to deal with a variety of possible needs,
from humanitarian to peace-keeping work. Moreover, it would help to ensure
that what was done in the WEU enhanced and did not duplicate what was done
in Nato.
The WEU needed, in particular, to identify which forces would be available
for use by the organisation. Britain had suggested that European
multinational formations such as the plan for a joint
Dutch-Belgian-German-British Nato division, or the UK/Netherlands Amphibious
Force, or the Franco-German corps, could be put at the disposal of the WEU.
However, in a thinly disguised reference to the Franco-German corps, Mr
Rifkind warned that there could be no question of a European country or
countries having permanent command of WEU forces. 'As in other areas of
European construction, we will have to share command and headquarters
roles.'

FT  17 JUN 92 / Liquidator sets up probe into affairs of Bristol-based bank
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BARCHARD, ANDREW JACK and JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ACCOUNTS of Deacon Hoare &amp; Co, a small Bristol-based bank which went
into liquidation last week, are being investigated for possible
irregularities, its liquidator said yesterday.
Mr Peter Rilett, the liquidator appointed by the court from Peat Marwick's
Bristol office, confirmed last night that he was examining movements of
money from the bank into other companies which shared some directors.
'There are matters which require to be investigated but until the
investigation is complete, I cannot say more,' said Mr Rilett. 'Among the
matters to be investigated are transactions with related parties, some with
related companies, a number of which are now in liquidation.'
Three smaller companies with related directorships are also now in
liquidation or receivership. They include Regent Leasing and Mistral
Finance.
Deacon Hoare's main directors were listed in its most recent accounts as Mr
Peter Garner of Bath and Mr Peter Tucker of Churt in Surrey. Mr Garner,
whose wife Anne is a former director of the company, owned 86 per cent of
Deacon Hoare's shares in 1990, with Mr Tucker owning most of the remainder.
Deacon Hoare, one of the smallest UK institutions with a banking licence,
applied for voluntary liquidation after its directors were informed that its
liabilities exceeded its assets. It is understood that the Bank of England
is aware of the position at Deacon Hoare. The bank provided leasing finance
for offices and motor vehicles, a line of business which has been badly hit
by the recession. A series of defaults on leasing agreements was blamed when
it decided to go into liquidation.
Deacon Hoare had fewer than 10 staff and around 200 depositors. Most
balances are believed to be below Pounds 20,000, the ceiling for eligibility
to recover up to 75 per cent of savings under the Deposit Protection Board
scheme.
Deacon Hoare offered unusually high interest rates to savers. According to
league tables prepared by Blay's Guides, a financial research company
followed throughout the industry - and published in magazines and newspapers
including the Financial Times - it offered the highest rate on Tax Exempt
Special Saver Accounts (Tessas) in the months following their introduction
last year.
On February 9 1991, for example, Deacon Hoare's Tessa offered 15.87 per
cent. The next highest rate, out of more than 110 accounts on offer, was
15.5 per cent. The average was below 14 per cent.
Representatives of at least one large life assurance company guided clients
towards Deacon Hoare on the basis of these high rates in spite of warnings
from consumer groups that unusually high interest rates usually reflect
greater risk.
An individual who invested the permitted maximum in a Deacon Hoare Tessa in
the first two years would have put in Pounds 4,800, not including accrued
interest.

FT  17 JUN 92 / London Stock Exchange: FT-SE Index regains the 2,600 level
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE RECOVERY in the UK stock market was taken a stage further yesterday, the
FT-SE 100 Index rebounding above the 2,600 mark with the help of a firm
stock index futures sector and some bargain hunting by the institutions.
Wider economic factors played little role in the share rally, which
reflected the oversold position that developed in the market last week.
Improvement in government bonds was ascribed to the news of a Public Sector
Borrowing Requirement of Pounds 3.13bn last month, slightly lower than
expected, rather than to suggestions in the UK press that a further
reduction in base rates might be on the cards.
Equities opened above Footsie 2,600, encouraged by the uptick in stock index
futures late on Monday evening. The running was taken up by evidence on the
Seaq overnight printer of at least one buying programme.
Evidence of at least one more buying programme crossed the trading screens
later. Traders found difficulty in tracing the complete picture, but
believed that by the end of the day the market had benefited from a Pounds
125m programme from a leading UK investment bank, accompanied by similar
Pounds 10m and Pounds 50m programmes, also from London sources.
However, the day's Seaq total of 391m shares remained relatively unexciting,
although an improvement on Monday's 359.5m. Customer, or retail, business in
equities in London fell to Pounds 681.2m on Monday, one of the lowest daily
totals since before the general election in April. On several days last
week, customer business exceeded Pounds 1bn.
The Footsie made progress throughout the day and was helped at the close by
a steady start to the new Wall Street session, where the Dow gained four
points in UK trading hours. The final reading of 2,616.3 on the FT-SE Index
left an advance of 22.7.
The recovery of confidence in the market was additionally reflected in an
increased flow of stock recommendations from brokerage houses. Several
leading houses take the view that the Footsie's fall last week to the 2,580
area has opened up buying opportunities. A number of stocks in the Footsie
list benefited from brokerage recommendations, notably Unilever, Ladbroke
Group and British Aerospace.
Confidence was also helped by a pause in the flow of corporate trading
results which drove the market downwards last week. Trading figures from the
electricity industry were taken fairly comfortably by a market now
concentrating on likely developments in pricing regulation among the
utilities.
Selling pressure was removed from a handful of leading stocks which have
dragged the market down recently. Midland Bank, now following the Hongkong
and Shanghai Banking Corporation share price, moved higher, and there was a
better tone throughout the banking sector.
US buyers returned for the leading pharmaceutical stocks and tobaccos
rallied from nervous falls in the previous session. But oil shares remained
overborne by renewed bearishness towards BP by the UK securities arm of a
leading French investment house.

FT  17 JUN 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A BETTER than expected PSBR figure, coupled with a view that recent falls
had been overdone, boosted activity in stock index futures, writes Joel
Kibazo.
The squeeze on Monday in after-hours' trading was repeated early yesterday
and the June contract opened strongly at 2,601, pulling the underlying cash
market higher, and helping the contract establish a five-point premium to
cash. Light selling then caused a slight retreat and June traded at a
discount to fair value just before 11.30am.
June found further support from the favourable performance of gilts and
bonds and resumed its upward direction in the afternoon session, before
settling into a narrow four-point range. It closed at 2,620, just off the
day's high of 2,622 and up 27 from Monday's poor close and at a five-point
premium to cash. With the expiry of June later this week, fair value stands
at nil. Turnover reached 7,260 lots.
The day in the options market was extremely poor and turnover reached a
meagre 24,396 contracts, of which the FT-SE option traded a day's total of
10,905 lots.
Hanson was the busiest stock option, trading 1,454 lots, with the August 200
puts particularly active. This was followed by BAT, in which 1,000 lots were
dealt.

FT  17 JUN 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow retreats as May housing
data ignored
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
A BIGGER than expected rise in May housing starts failed to lift sentiment
on US stock markets yesterday, and blue chip issues led equities into lower
territory, writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 25.41 at 3,329.49.
The losses on the more broadly based Stan-dard &amp; Poor's 500 were less
extensive, the index finishing down 1.97 at 408.32. The American SE
composite slipped 2.66 to 386.12 and the Nasdaq composite shed 4.94 to
564.07.
Turnover on the New York SE was modest, at 194m shares, while declines
outpaced rises by 952 to 755.
Although the morning's economic data - an 11 per cent rise in housing starts
last month and a 0.6 per cent increase in May industrial production - should
have been broadly positive for equities, investors chose to ignore the data.
An afternoon report from the Johnson Redbook Service of a 4.5 per cent
decline in early June department and chain store sales only added to the
gloom.
Compaq fell Dollars 2 3/8 to Dollars 25 after Alex Brown &amp; Sons, the
Baltimore based broking house, lowered its investment rating for the stock
and trimmed its 1992 earnings estimate from Dollars 1.82 a share to Dollars
1.45.
Other big computer stocks were mostly weaker, with IBM down Dollars 1 at
Dollars 93 and Hewlett-Packard Dollars 2 1/8 lower at Dollars 68 3/8 .
Time Warner advanced Dollars 2 1/8 to Dollars 109 on reports that analysts
do not expect major changes at the top of the media group while Mr Steven
Ross, Time Warner's chairman, is on temporary sick leave.
Arctic Alaska Fisheries soared Dollars 4 3/4 to Dollars 11 5/8 in heavy
trading after the company agreed to be acquired by Tyson Foods in a stock
and cash transaction which values each Arctic share at about Dollars 12 3/4
. The news sent Tyson down Dollars 1 to Dollars 17 1/2 on the Nasdaq market.
McDonnell Douglas, which fell sharply on Monday on news that it was delaying
the launch of its MD-12 jet due to a lack of orders, recovered Dollars  1/2
to Dollars 38 3/4 .
Canada
TORONTO stocks slipped from afternoon highs, but weathered the weakness of
Wall Street fairly well. Shares were boosted in morning trading by the rise
in US housing starts for May, but the market quickly discounted the data.
The TSE 300 composite index closed just 2.5 down at 3,407.3, while falls led
rises by only 290 to 280 after volume of 25m shares valued at CDollars 232m.
Mitel surged 24 cents to CDollars 1.69 a day after Schroders &amp; Partners said
it will buy British Telecom's 51 per cent stake in the company.

FT  17 JUN 92 / Money Markets: Rates unchanged
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
SHORT-TERM rates in the sterling cash market were mostly unchanged
yesterday, even though the Bank of England forecast a shortage in the
morning that was smaller than dealers had expected.
Rates remained unchanged because the shortage, initially forecast at Pounds
700m, proved difficult to remove. Many of the Bank of England's previous
repurchase agreements are expiring this week, and the end of the second
quarter is also approaching. As a result, many market practitioners require
short-dated paper on their books for liquidity purposes.
The authorities are unwilling to offer the short-dated repurchase agreements
that the market would like, however, perhaps out of fear that this might
misrepresent their policy on base rates. Instead the Bank continued Monday's
practice of offering to buy the shorter dated Bands 1 and 2 at 9 7/8 per
cent, Band 3 at 9 21/32 per cent and Band 4 at 9 19/32 per cent.
Yesterday, the Bank bought Pounds 15m of Band 3 bank bills and Pounds 1m of
Band 4 bank bills in the early round. Later, it purchased Pounds 13m of Band
1 bank bills, Pounds 37m of Band 3 bank bills and Pounds 5m of Band 4 bank
bills. The forecast was revised down to around Pounds 550m at the start of
the afternoon. The Bank bought Pounds 4m of Band 1 treasury bills and Pounds
257m of Band 1 bank bills, and provided late assistance of around Pounds
80m.
One discount house trader said the Bank may have misjudged how 'sticky' the
market still was when revising down the shortage so much in the afternoon.
The overnight rate was still up at 11 1/2 per cent towards the end of
trading. One-week sterling libor ended firmer at 10 1/2 per cent, one-month
money stayed at 10 1/16 per cent and 3-month money closed at 10 per cent.
Trading in sterling futures had a more bullish tone, possibly because the
market was influenced by suggestions in two tabloid newspapers that the
British prime minister was considering an early cut in base rates. September
short sterling traded up 9 ticks to close at 90.25.
December short sterling also traded up 9 ticks to end at 90.54. Both
movements suggest that the market is back to believing there could be a
half-point cut in base rates before the end of the year.

FT  17 JUN 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar slips despite indicators
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DOLLAR ended weaker against the D-Mark on the foreign exchanges
yesterday after failing to draw strong support from favourable US economic
figures, writes James Blitz.
Figures for housing starts and industrial production both showed higher
gains than expected. The May housing starts data revealed an 11 per cent
rise to 1.23m units when around 1.17m had been expected. Industrial
production rose 0.6 per cent in May against forecasts of a 0.5 per cent
gain.
After an early best level in Europe of DM1.5702, the dollar slipped to
finish at DM1.5670, compared with a previous close of DM1.5710. It further
declined in New York trading to end at DM1.5638.
Although the figures showed that a steady but slow recovery was under way,
traders were not able to shrug off underlying fears that the Federal Reserve
might ease short-term rates again. An analyst in London commented: 'What the
market wants is a definitive signal of where rates are heading and the data
were far from that.' Others await today's 'beige book' report, summing up
the views of the regional Fed presidents, before taking a new view on the
currency.
The dollar was not helped by the D-Mark's continued strong tone. The
Bundesbank yesterday reiterated its determination to keep interest rates
high as long as there is no indication that inflation has been brought under
control. The central bank also revised its figure for April money supply
growth upwards.
On top of this, the German currency is certain to remain strong in the
run-up to tomorrow's referendum in Ireland on the Maastricht Treaty.
The D-Mark ended higher against sterling at DM2.9150 from a previous close
of DM2.9180. The pound also slipped back to bottom of the European Monetary
System grid. The German unit made fresh headway against the Italian lira,
finishing at L757.1 from a previous L756.7. However, the D-Mark was
unchanged against the French franc at FFr3.367.
The yen closed stronger against both the dollar and the D-Mark following
news that Japan's GNP rose to a real annualised 4.3 per cent in the first
quarter of this year after a revised 0.3 per cent contraction in the last
quarter of 1991. However, economists said the figure did not signal a real
recovery yet.
An analyst at a German bank said: 'The official spin being put on these
numbers is that things look pretty good. But these numbers do not reveal the
reality of the situation, which is that the (Japanese) economy is sliding
into recession.'
The market took a more bullish view of the data. The yen ended at Y126.6 to
the dollar from Y126.7. In New York the dollar eased to Y126.45.

FT  17 JUN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Unrest hits Polish copper mines
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   WARSAW, MONTREAL
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
LABOUR UNREST hit Poland's LGHM copper combine yesterday as miners at two
out of three copper ore pits staged a token two-hour stoppage backed by
workers at the combine's smelters.
Unions leading LGHM's 40,000 strong workforce are demanding a 30 per cent
wage increase and yesterday's protest precedes a shopfloor vote on June 24
to decide on whether to hold an all out strike to back the claim.
The unrest came after a visit last week to LGHM by the board of Australia's
Western Mining Corporation designed to examine a possible investment in the
combine. Sir Arvi Parbo, the company's chairman says of the 18-month long
dialogue Western Mining has been conducting with the Poles that 'we are
still investigating the project' and adds that a joint venture would be on
the cards 'under the right conditions'.
Last month Asarco, the US metals producer, offered to sign a management
contract with LGHM for three years after which decisions could be taken by
the Polish authorities on whether to sell a share of the plant.
Polish officials are telling prospective investors that foreign capital is
welcome but that final decisions have to await the opening of competitive
procedures for bids from foreign companies.
LGHM is one of those rare Polish companies that are unencumbered by debt and
last year showed a Zl 3,500bn (Pounds 140m) gross profit.
Last year LGHM produced 23.7m tonnes of copper ore and 345,000 tonnes of
refined copper, of which 241,000 tonnes was sold abroad, 18 per cent more
than in 1990. Production plans this year are set at around 385,000 tonnes of
which some 240,000 should be exported.
Nearly 900 unionised workers at Noranda's copper refinery in Montreal, with
yearly capacity of 335,000 tonnes, have overwhelmingly voted to accept a new
three-year contract providing a 3 per cent average pay increase in each
year, and improved fringe benefits, writes Robert Gibbens in Montreal.
The workers are represented by the United Steelworkers. The settlement is in
line with Canada's expected inflation rate.

FT  17 JUN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: S African gold profits 'lowest
since 1960s'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   JOHANNESBURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE PRICE of gold has fallen by 33 per cent in real terms since 1988, taking
real profits in the South African gold mining industry to the lowest level
since the 1960s, Mr Naas Steenkamp, the outgoing president of the Chamber of
Mines, told members yesterday.
The nominal rand gold price had been virtually flat since 1988 at about R990
(Dollars 350) a troy ounce, he said.
Production last year, at 601 tonnes, was only 4 tonnes lower than in 1990.
But output had only been maintained by increasing the average grade mined to
5.2 grams a tonne from 5.05 grams in 1990.
Mr Steenkamp praised the industry's 'quite remarkable performance' in cost
containment, with the average working cost per kilogram of gold produced, at
R26,136, only 1.6 per cent up from 1990. He compared this to five years
previously when the comparable increase was 25 per cent.
The downside of the picture was the 36,000 people who lost their jobs in the
industry last year, with a further 15,000 already in 1992. Also of concern,
said Mr Steenkamp, was the fact that capital expenditure and dividend
payments declined by 16.9 per cent and 10.4 per cent respectively.
All South Africa's other large mineral exports - coal, platinum, diamonds,
zinc, copper, nickel and lead - also faced difficult markets.
Despite these problems, Mr Steenkamp said he had no reason to believe that
the mining industry 'will have anything but an exciting and productive
future'. He is succeeded as president by Mr Bobby Godsell of Anglo American.

FT  17 JUN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: LME zinc price fall accelerates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Commodities Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FALL in zinc prices triggered by the London Metal Exchange's move on
Monday to ease a market squeeze accelerated yesterday, and traders and
analysts expect further losses in coming weeks, writes Our Commodities
Staff.
After watching the cash premium over three months metal climb from zero to
nearly Dollars 190 a tonne in two-and-a-half months the exchange stepped in
to establish maximum daily premiums for the June/July period, ranging from
Dollars 15 to Dollars 5 a tonne. A cash premium is normally associated with
supply tightness, but the recent widening of the price gap has been
coincided with a rapid build up in the exchange's warehouse stocks to a
record level.
The immediate response to the LME's action on Monday was a Dollars 24 fall
in the cash price and a narrowing of the 'backwardation', as the cash
premium is known, to Dollars 166 a tonne. Yesterday the cash price lost
another Dollars 56 at Dollars 1,367.50 a tonne and the backwardation shrank
further to Dollars 136.25.
'We're seeing signs of liquidation - it (the three months price) has gone
through the Dollars 1,250 support without too much difficulty,' commented
independent metals analyst Mr Robin Bhar.
'When you are a manufacturer it is difficult to appreciate what seems to be
a game, and a highly expensive one at that,' one producer said.

FT  17 JUN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: US exchanges go to market with
commodity baskets - Index-based futures contracts being developed for
trading in Chicago
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARBARA DURR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE WORLD'S two largest futures exchanges, the Chicago Board of Trade and
the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, may have built their massive trading
volumes on financial futures, but they are about to take a step back toward
traditional, physical commodities. The return path for the two exchanges
will be futures contracts based on commodity price indices composed
exclusively of physical market prices for products such as soyabeans,
copper, live cattle and crude oil.
The CME will be first in to bat with futures on the Goldman Sachs Commodity
Index (GSCI). Mr Jack Sandner, the CME chairman, says that the exchange
plans to launch the contract by the end of July. He is convinced that the
investing world will be keen to trade an index of major commodities that has
a good record of anticipating the inflationary cycle.
Goldman Sachs, the big Wall Street investment bank, started the index only a
year ago, in May 1991. But, thanks in part to Goldman's international
prominence, it has quickly gained market recognition. The index was
developed to offer investors a product having a low correlation with stocks
and bonds. Goldman's market analysts believe that interest in the index will
be encouraged over the next few years by a widespread recovery in commodity
prices from the recent historic lows.
The GSCI is composed of 18 physical commodities - wheat, maize, soyabeans,
cotton, sugar, coffee, cocoa, crude oil, unleaded gasoline, heating oil,
live cattle, live hogs, aluminium, copper, gold, zinc, platinum and silver -
weighted by production. The weighting is based on United Nations production
data and all weights are a five-year average, lagged three years. The index
base is 1970. Because it is production weighted and production is influenced
by consumption, the index is more sensitive to changes in real economic
conditions than an equally weighted index.
The CME's future will be cash settled to an index price of the nearby
futures contracts of which it is composed. The trading unit will be Dollars
250 times the GSCI, with contract months of February, April, June, October
and December.
Trading hours, in Chicago time, will be 7:20 am to 2:15 pm. The price
increment will be a tenth of an index point or Dollars 25 a contract.
The CBoT is developing an international commodity index, also composed of
only physical prices, in co-operation with the Commodities Research Bureau,
a division of Knight Ridder Financial. Neither the CBoT nor CRB will
disclose what exactly will be in their new index, but they say it will be
production weighted and composed of 18 commodities traded on seven US and
foreign exchanges.
The CRB has had an index since 1957, which is the most widely known and the
most widely followed in commodity trading. That index today is composed of
21 equally weighted commodities - cattle, cocoa, coffee, copper, cotton,
crude oil, gold, heating oil, live hogs, lumber, maize, oats, orange juice,
platinum, pork bellies, silver, soyabean meal, soyabean oil, soyabeans sugar
and wheat.
A future based on it has traded at the New York Futures Exchange since 1986,
but not with a great deal of success. Its peak trading volume year was 1988,
when 205,951 contracts changed hands. But volume then dwindled and by last
year had declined to just 61,185 contracts.
The CBoT is awaiting regulatory approval from the Commodity Futures Trading
Commission, the US watchdog, to proceed with the contract. No time frame for
a launch is yet set.
Despite the enthusiasm of both exchanges for commodity index futures, the
NYFE's rather dismal record with the CRB index would seem to raise doubts
about the prospects for such a product.
A few important differences may, however, give the Chicago exchanges a
better shot. The indices will be production weighted and both exchanges are
large, liquid markets compared to the tiny NYFE.
The CME may in addition have a few advantages over its old rival, the CBoT.
The GSCI has market recognition and the gleam of a big Wall Street firm to
it. While the original CRB index enjoys market recognition, the new
international CRB index is an unknown.
The GSCI is completely and easily investible - that is one can buy the
separate contracts underlying the index - within the US and in the same time
zone. The CBoT's global CRB index will include contracts traded on foreign
exchanges in different time zones.
While the CBoT has not even yet unveiled its new index, the CME has begun to
market its product vigorously already. It has even run advertisements in the
Wall Street Journal offering special permits to attract new traders.
Furthermore, a suspicion that the CBoT's contract is another 'me-too'
product may not help it. The CBoT announced its intentions to begin a new
index future long after the CME's plan on the GSCI was known. The two
exchanges have historically competed against each other by introducing
similar contracts, though usually only one truly takes off. And sometimes
both fail.

FT  17 JUN 92 / Government Bonds: Treasuries buoyed by positive inflation
comments
</HEADLINE>

POSITIVE comments on inflation from Mr Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve
chairman, and news of lower store sales helped Treasury prices recovery from
early losses yesterday.
In late trading the benchmark 30-year government bond was up  1/4 at 101
27/32 , yielding 7.832 per cent. The two-year note was also higher, up  1/16
at 100 1/4 , yielding 4.971 per cent.
The market weakened early on after government data showed an 11 per cent
rise in housing starts last month, the largest monthly rise since February
1991. Later in the morning, however, prices moved into positive territory on
Mr Greenspan's written testimony to a Congressional committee. He told the
committee that the economy was 'poised to make further advances' in trimming
inflation.
The market was also helped by news of a 0.6 per cent rise in May industrial
production, a figure in line with expectations, and a report from the
Johnson Redbook Service that department and chain store sales fell 4.5 per
cent during the first two weeks in June.
UK government bonds shrugged off funding worries and ended the day over
one-eighth of a point higher at the long end, on healthy buying interest and
better-than-expected Public Sector Borrowing Requirement figures.
The PSBR amounted to Pounds 3.134bn in May, compared with Pounds 3.464bn in
the previous month. The figure was well below many City forecasters'
expectations, some of whom had predicted a PSBR of Pounds 4bn.
The gilt-edged market has suffered recently due to the combination of
funding worries and uncertainty about the prospects of European economic and
monetary union in the wake of Denmark's vote against ratification of the
Maastricht Treaty.
The Bank of England announced yesterday afternoon it would auction Pounds
2.75bn of the 9 per cent gilt due 2012 on June 24. The news led to a slight
fall in gilt prices initially as dealers said the auction was larger than
expected. The issue will be partly-paid with 35p payable on July 20 and 30p
on August 25. The existing issue is about Pounds 1.5bn in size.
Despite the larger-than-expected auction size, the market later picked up
and the benchmark 11 3/4 per cent gilt due 2003/07 traded up to 116 7/32 ,
from its opening level of 115 7/8 .
DANISH government bonds dropped about half a point yesterday after the
central bank decided to sell its tap stock well below the level at which it
was already trading.
Traders estimated about DKr4bn of the 8 per cent bond, due 2003, was sold
yesterday after the price was announced. Many complained about the bank's
decision to undercut the market price, prompting a fall in Danish bond
prices. The yield spread over the 9 per cent German bond due 2000 widened
from 108 basis points to 116 basis points.
German government bonds traded narrowly, ending the day slightly higher. The
Liffe bund future contract traded between 88.02 and 88.16.
HOPES of a cut in short-term interest rates nudged Japanese government bond
prices slightly higher yesterday. Most of the activity concentrated on short
and medium-dated issues, while long-dated bonds ended the day little
changed, leading to a slight steepening in the yield curve. The benchmark No
129 closed with a yield of 5.48 per cent, against its opening level of 5.47
per cent.

clinical programme
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A US Food and Drug Administration advisory panel yesterday voted unanimously
to recommend that Viagene be allowed to begin human clinical trials on its
HIV-immunotherapeutic treatment, AP-DJ reports from Washington.
The panel expressed overwhelming support for the design of the proposed
studies by the company and found that, based on previous animal studies,
commencement of clinical studies was reasonable and safe. One panel member
said Viagene has taken 'an exciting approach and I wish the sponsor well'.
The panel suggested certain analyses of data be performed including the
development of assays to measure the therapy's effect on cytotoxic
T-lymphocytes (CTL) counts to increase sensitivity, but the panel felt that
most concerns were already being addressed by the company.
The company intends to begin trials in the third quarter of 1992. The
studies will evaluate the safety of the therapy in HIV-positive patients
with a CD4 count greater than 500 who are asymptomatic and between the ages
of 18 and 50. The company intends to exclude pregnant women and patients who
have undergone anti-retroviral treatments.
Assuming the full FDA affirms the panel's recommendation, the next step is
to begin phase I studies which evaluate safety of the therapy in humans. If
safety is demonstrated phase II and phase III studies will follow to
evaluate safety and efficacy.
The company said that its ultimate goal was to develop a vaccine that would
be used in the HIV-negative population.

<TEXT>
CENTRAL Capital, the Canadian financial services group which includes the
country's fourth-largest trust company, has been granted court protection
from 39 senior unsecured creditors, writes Robert Gibbens in Montreal.
An Ontario court froze all other claims against Central Capital under the
federal Companies Creditors Arrangement Act and appointed Peat Marwick
Thorne as administrator.
The 39 creditors, led by the Royal Bank of Canada which is owed CDollars
550m (USDollars 462m), will ask for a supervised restructuring of Central
Capital, transferring its mortgage insurance and general insurance arms to
the creditors.
Central Capital owes a total of about CDollars 1.7bn. Its 80 per cent-owned
trust subsidiary is in the process of being sold.
Mr Bill Woloshyn, a lawyer for Royal Bank of Canada, said the creditors
wanted to secure maximum recovery and ensure that a restructured Central
Capital can survive.

FT  17 JUN 92 / International Company News: Carolco cuts Live shareholding
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CAROLCO Pictures has cut its stake in Live Entertainment to a minority
holding of 49.9 per cent by selling 360,000 shares in the video distribution
company to three Carolco investors. The deal is yet another complex
manoeuvre to keep the troubled, independent Hollywood studio in business.
Carolco said it sold the Live shares, for about Dollars 2.19 each, to
protect itself from a possible cross-default in its public and private debt.
This follows Live's failure to make the latest interest payment on its 14.5
per cent senior subordinated notes.
As a 53 per cent majority shareholder in Live, Carolco was vulnerable to a
possible default by the video distribution company.
Earlier this year, the same three Carolco investors - Pioneer LDCA, an
affiliate of Tokyo's Pioneer Electronics, Le Studio Canal Plus, a unit of
France's Canal Plus, and RCS Video International Services, an affiliate of
Italy's Rizzoli Corriere della Sera - agreed to a Dollars 73.8m financing
package for Carolco in a move to keep the company operating.
Carolco, however, still faces a serious cash shortfall.
The studio is still struggling to survive in spite of the outstanding
success of a number of recent Carolco productions, including the Terminator
films and Basic Instinct.
The company has been hurt by a combination of factors, including its 'open
purse' policy of paying generous amounts for box-office stars, such as
Arnold Swarzenegger.
Earlier this month, Carolco said it could not draw on a Dollars 22.8m line
of credit because it had not met certain terms.
In the first quarter, a gain of Dollars 4.9m from the purchase of debt
helped Carolco reduce its net loss to Dollars 4.3m, or 20 cents a share,
from Dollars 6.3m, or 27 cents, but the company's operating loss grew to
Dollars 9.2m from Dollars 6.3m. Revenues were virtually flat at Dollars
136.5m.

FT  17 JUN 92 / International Company News: Macy falls deeper in the red
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RH MACY, the large US department store chain which filed for Chapter 11
bankruptcy protection earlier this year, yesterday turned in a net loss of
Dollars 225.9m for the third quarter to May 2.
The figures were distorted by a Dollars 75m charge for interest expense and
Dollars 91m in reorganisation expenses, including Dollars 85m to cover the
costs of closing some stores.
In the corresponding period of fiscal 1991, Macy had a net loss of Dollars
100.9m, including one-time gains of Dollars 15m.
Sales in the latest quarter slid 5.8 per cent to Dollars 1.31bn from Dollars
1.39bn.
On a same-store, comparable week basis, Macy said sales in the 1992 quarter
had fallen 6.4 per cent.
Macy said the results also reflected the depressed economic conditions in
its key markets in the north-eastern US and California, as well as the
disruption in merchandise deliveries during the period of the bankruptcy
filing.
Mr Mark Handler and Mr Myron Ullman, co-chairmen and co-chief executives who
replaced Mr Edward Finkelstein in April, said: 'We are continuing to take
steps to return Macy to profitability and guide it out of Chapter 11.'
Macy has closed five I Magnin stores, 52 specialty stores and has plans to
close another eight under-performing department stores.
The company said that it had Dollars 103m in cash and cash equivalents on
June 12. It added that it had not used its Dollars 600m debtor-in-possession
credit facility to meet working capital needs, although some of the facility
was committed for overseas letters of credit.
In the third quarter, Macy's pre-tax losses from operations, before interest
expense and reorganisation costs, grew to Dollars 59.7m from Dollars 15m in
the year-earlier period.
For the first nine months, the company's pre-tax loss from operations,
before interest expense and reorganisation costs, was Dollars 586.8m against
pretax profits of Dollars 248.8m in the corresponding period last year.

<TEXT>
TYSON Foods, the US fresh foods and poultry group, is to acquire Arctic
Alaska Fisheries in a merger deal valued at more than Dollars 200m, Reuter
reports from Arkansas.
Under the terms of the deal, 0.5686 Tyson shares plus Dollars 2.23 cash will
be exchanged for each Arctic Alaska share.
Arctic Alaska said Tyson would issue about 9.47m Class A shares plus about
Dollars 37.2m in cash in the deal, which is valued at Dollars 212.4m, based
on the Dollars 18.50 closing price of Tyson shares on June 15.
Arctic Alaska, which earned Dollars 16.7m in 1991 on revenues of Dollars
225m, operates a fleet of 31 fishing vessels. Tyson said it expected Arctic
Alaska to post 1992 revenues of about Dollars 250m.
Arctic Alaska also operates two Seattle-based reprocessing plants as well as
shore-based fish processing plants.
The merger is subject to conditions, including approval by two-thirds of
Arctic Alaska shareholders and by regulatory authorities.
Nabisco Foods Group, a unit of RJR Nabisco Holdings, will exchange its 32
per cent interest in Grupo Gamesa, Mexico's largest biscuit and cracker
company, for five of Gamesa's food and pet food companies and an amount of
cash, Reuter reports. The agreement is with PepsiCo's international snack
food division, PepsiCo Foods International, Gamesa's other owner.

FT  17 JUN 92 / International Company News: Dasa to take stake in Loral
venture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DASA, the aerospace arm of Daimler-Benz, is paying Dollars 57m for a 12 1/4
per cent stake in Space Systems/Loral, the US commercial satellite
manufacturer.
Loral, the defence electronics company and the biggest shareholder in Space
Systems, is injecting another Dollars 59m into the company to maintain its
stake at 51 per cent.
Dasa is joining three other European space industry companies - Alcatel and
Aerospatiale of France and Alenia of Italy - which also have stakes in Space
Systems. With the arrival of Dasa, each will have 12 1/4 per cent.
The move by Dasa had been triggered by increasingly tough international
competition, Mr Rolf Arnim, Dasa's managing director of communications
satellite programme, said yesterday. 'The European satellite industry must
collaborate, and we have decided to do it with the US.'
US satellite builders have repeatedly beaten their European rivals in
winning contracts to build civil telecommunications satellites. Hughes
Aircraft of Los Angeles is the industry leader with a market share of more
than 60 per cent.
Dasa's decision is also the latest step in the consolidation of the European
satellite manufacturing industry.
British Aerospace this month halved capacity at its satellite manufacturing
plant at Stevenage, north of London. Competitive pressures have also
prompted it to enter merger talks with Matra-Marconi, an Anglo-French rival.
Space Systems was established in late 1990 by Loral, Alcatel, Aerospatiale
and Alenia. The company got off to an encouraging start by winning a Dollars
500m contract for a Japanese satellite programme.
Dasa decided to join them last month and is awaiting US regulatory approval.
'We do not believe this will be a problem because the other three European
companies have already been approved,' said Mr Arnim. Dasa's stake will be
satisfied with the issue of new shares, he said.
Loral, the parent, had sales of Dollars 2.9bn in 1991 and profits of Dollars
122m. Mr Bernard Schwartz, its chairman and chief executive, said last month
that the company wanted to become further involved in non-military markets.
In March, Mr Schwartz visited Europe looking for potential acquisitions and
collaborations. In 1990 Loral paid Dollars 750m for Ford Aerospace and
elbowed its way into the commercial space arena.
Previously Loral had systematically acquired some of the defence activities
of leading US 'blue chip' companies which had decided to diversify into the
military sector and are now refocusing activities on their core operations.

FT  17 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Gieves plans to raise Pounds 3.9m
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GIEVES GROUP is selling its Bookpoint book distributor for Pounds 1.4m cash
to Headline Book Publishing and raising Pounds 2.5m through a placing of
convertible secured loan stock.
The group, which has interests in clothing, retailing and publishing and
includes Gieves &amp; Hawkes the Savile Row tailor, reported pre-tax losses of
Pounds 1.51m (Pounds 428,000)in the year to January 31, after exceptional
charges of Pounds 1.71m and taking into account discontinued activities.
The sale and placing are part of Gieves strategy of focusing on its core
businesses. Roundabout, the motor distributor, has been sold to its
management and Redwood Press to the Bath Press Group.
Headline is Bookpoint's largest customer, accounting for 27 per cent of
sales. Trading profits for the year to end-January were Pounds 441,000,
against Pounds 280,000 on turnover of Pounds 3.97m.
The consideration was satisfied by the issue of 700,000 shares which have
been conditionally placed. Headline is placing a further 100,000 shares to
cover acquisition expenses. Its shares fell 3p to 205p.
The convertible loan stock has been placed with a wholly-owned subsidiary of
USI Holdings, a Hong Kong-quoted company which is controlled by Wing Tai,
the Singapore clothing company.
The loan is redeemable at par on July 31 2000. USI can convert into shares
at its option at any time up to three months before the redemption date at a
rate of 2 shares for every Pounds 1 of loan stock.
Full conversion would give USI a holding of 26.8 per cent. Wing Tai says it
does not intend in the next 12 months to acquire shares that would take its
holding above 29.9 per cent allowing for full conversion. It also does not
intend to make a full offer without the agreement of the Gieves board.
Group turnover was lower at Pounds 48.5m (Pounds 53.7m).
The pre-tax figure included losses of Pounds 634,000 (Pounds 1.14m) relating
to the sold book and magazine manufacturers and the motor and petrol
retailers.
Losses per share were 11.1p (3.1p). The final dividend is being passed as
was the interim.

FT  17 JUN 92 / UK Company News: US side boosts Erskine House
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STRONG growth in the US helped Erskine House, the office equipment services
company, to announce a 5 per cent advance in pre-tax profits to Pounds 12.7m
for last year.
Mr Brian McGillivray, the chairman who transformed Erskine through a heady
programme of acquisitions in the 1980s, said the company had benefited from
cost-cutting in the US and Pounds 1.4m decrease group interest charges to
Pounds 3.7m.
The savings offset a 6 per cent decline in group sales to Pounds 178.9m for
the year to March 31.
Mr McGillivray said Erskine was seeing a slight improvement in the US after
the severely depressed conditions of 1991. 'We are a little more happy,' he
said.
The US contributed pre-tax profits of Pounds 7.2m (Pounds 4.9m).
The UK remained difficult, and Mr McGillivray held out little hope for a
significant improvement in the current year.
Machine sales in the UK had been 'disappointingly low' and margins depressed
by price-cutting. Furthermore, adverse publicity surrounding the leasing
industry had cost Erskine between Pounds 750,000 and Pounds 1m in operating
profits last year.
Servicing income rose slightly during the year, but UK pre-tax profits still
fell almost 19 per cent to Pounds 5.1m. Erskine sold its laser printer
business for Pounds 4.7m, which accounted for Pounds 800,000 in operating
profits in 1991.
Germany suffered a 58 per cent decline in pre-tax profits to Pounds 371,000.
Debt fell from Pounds 41.3m to Pounds 36.3m, representing 50 per cent of
shareholders' funds.
The dividend was maintained at 4.35p, for a total of 6.65p. Earnings per
share were depressed from 14.5p to 11.7p by a higher tax charge.
COMMENT
Erskine House may be finding its way back into City affections. The results
appear to show that the same management, accused of going too far too fast
on the acquisition trail in the 1980s, can steer the company through a tough
recession. Points in favour include the long-term nature of debt, and the
steady servicing income in most markets. Erskine is also unlikely to tread
on toes with any big acquisitions in the next year or two. This said, the
debt obligations and late cycle nature of copier leasing means Erskine will
not show immediate dazzling growth. Forecasts for 1993 range from same again
to about Pounds 14.5m. On yesterday's close of 86p, the prospective p/e
looks almost too low at about 6 or 7 times. Shares are further supported by
a healthy yield of more than 10 per cent.

FT  17 JUN 92 / UK Company News: National Power advances 18%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIET SYCHRAVA
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NATIONAL POWER, the electricity generator, yesterday reported pre-tax
profits up 18 per cent to Pounds 514m for the year to March 31 1992, the
first full year since it was privatised.
Earnings per share increased by 22 per cent to 28.63p (23.54p), and the
dividend goes up 10 per cent to 9.1p.
Mr John Baker, chief executive, said the results showed the company, was
competing successfully in the new privatised electricity market.
'Profits are beginning to reflect the major restructuring we are
undergoing,' he said.
The company's performance was achieved against the background of a 0.2 per
cent growth in the electricity market.
Its unit sales fell by 3.9 per cent, and it lost market share to rival
generator, Nuclear Electric.
A sharp rise in electricity prices accounted for a 7.4 per cent increase in
turnover to Pounds 4.7bn. Prices in the pool or wholesale market rose by
nearly 25 per cent, while income from direct sales to customers rose by 30
per cent.
Although costs rose by just over 5 per cent overall, fuel costs fell as the
company used up old cheaply-priced coal stocks.
It also saved about Pounds 150m after shedding 21 per cent of its workforce,
or 3,000 jobs, as part of a programme announced after privatisation. These
manpower savings boosted productivity by 13 per cent.
Improved turnover and cost savings together gave a 23 per cent increase in
operating profits.
Good cash flow financed nearly Pounds 500m of capital expenditure, 22 per
cent more than in the previous year. This was mainly spent on reducing
emissions, and building new gas stations.
Borrowings at the year end fell by 5 per cent, although the average for the
year was higher, giving an interest charge of Pounds 11m against net
interest income of Pounds 7m the year before.
The outlook for the coming year was still uncertain, National Power said,
because it has not yet agreed a deal with British Coal, its main fuel
supplier, or the regional companies, its main customers.
The electricity market would improve only slightly, Mr Baker said. That
meant National Power had to rely on cost-cutting and lower fuel prices to
provide short-term growth.
In the longer term, its strategy is to expand overseas, and Mr Baker said he
hoped to invest Pounds 1bn in international generation ventures by the end
of the decade.
City analysts expect a pre-tax profit of between Pounds 550m and Pounds 590m
next year, giving earnings of between 31.5p and 34.5p per share, and a
dividend of 10p to 10.2p.

FT  17 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Norweb almost doubles to Pounds 137.9m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIET SYCHRAVA
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NORWEB, the Manchester-based regional electricity company, yesterday
announced pre-tax profits up by 96 per cent to Pounds 137.9m for the year to
March 31 1992, writes Juliet Sychrava.
Earnings per share rose sharply from 24.5p to 51p and the dividend is
increased by 13.2 per cent to 17.7p.
'This year's results demonstrate that high quality customer service and
profits can, and must, go hand in hand,' said Mr Ken Harvey, Norweb's
chairman who noted that the company had disconnected fewer customers than
ever before.
The main reason for the leap in Norweb's profits was higher electricity
prices. Like all 12 regional companies, Norweb increased prices sharply in
April 1991 to recoup losses from undercharging the previous year.
Norweb's 9.9 per cent price increase was one of the lowest in the industry,
but the company's profit rise will be one of the highest.
This is because exceptional items totalling some Pounds 30m also depressed
profits last year. These arose from bad debts relating to its retail
business, as well as an accelerated depreciation charge.
If these items and the effect of recovering losses from the previous year
were excluded, Norweb said, the underlying profit growth would be only 20
per cent.
The main underlying growth came in the core distribution business, where
operating profit rose by nearly 75 per cent. But the retail business also
made a strong improvement, with an Pounds 8.3m profit compared with a loss
of Pounds 7.5m the previous year.
The low margin electricity supply business, which buys and sells bulk
electricity, made Pounds 11.9m against Pounds 11.8m previously. The
contracting business incurred losses.
Underlying growth was partly due to a 1.4 per cent increase in sales, mainly
to commercial customers.
The company also recovered about half of the big customers it lost when
privatisation meant the regional companies had to compete to keep local
customers.
Costs were carefully controlled, Norweb said. Some 280 jobs were cut over
the year, leaving a workforce of 7,367, and controllable costs fell 1 per
cent in real terms.
Gearing fell from 32.2 per cent to 22.1 per cent, and capital expenditure
was down Pounds 8.5m to Pounds 66.3m.
Analysts forecast pre-tax profits for the year ending March 1993 of between
Pounds 145m and Pounds 155m, giving earnings per share of 55p to 64p.
Dividend forecasts range between 19.5p and 20p.
COMMENT
Norweb's quietly tenacious emphasis on marketing and retailing should
perhaps have won it more Brownie points from the City, which has
historically favoured nearby Yorkshire's more forceful style.
Norweb should at least get points for doing what it promised with the retail
business, which now has an Pounds 8.3m profit at a time when most companies'
retail businesses are only just breaking even.
If the company can now fulfil its promise to turn retail into a Pounds 300m
business contributing nearly 20 per cent of profits in 1996, then it will
have what many regional companies so far do not - a good non-core business
for the future and something to spend its cash on.
This promise might temper investors' reservations about the company's rather
cautious dividend policy - like East Midlands yesterday it suggested this
year's increase was a not-to-be-repeated windfall.

FT  17 JUN 92 / Norweb lifts profits 96% at year-end
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIET SYCHRAVA
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NORWEB, the Manchester-based regional electricity company, yesterday
reported a 96 per cent rise in pre-tax profit to Pounds 137.9m for the year
to March 1992.
This will provide more grist for the mills of critics of electricity
privatisation, who have attacked the 41 per cent increase announced on
Monday by East Midlands Electricity, the first regional company to report.
The result follows a warning on Monday from Professor Stephen Littlechild,
the electricity regulator, that the privatised industry would not be allowed
to make excessive profits.
But Mr Ken Harvey, Norweb chairman, said the company was being fair to
customers. 'Our tariff increase of only 1 per cent this year was one of the
lowest in the industry,' he said.
The company also pointed out that the underlying increase in profits was a
more modest 20 per cent, close to the 18 per cent increase in pre-tax profit
to Pounds 514m announced yesterday by National Power, Britain's largest
electricity generator.
Norweb's big increase last year was partly because - like all 12 regional
electricity companies - it raised prices sharply in April 1991. This was to
compensate for the previous year, when the companies undercharged customers.
In addition, profits in the previous year were depressed by exceptional
costs, particularly bad debts in the company's retail business. If both
these factors were stripped out, Norweb said, underlying profit would have
increased 20 per cent.
National Power was the focus of attention yesterday when it came to job
losses. It cut a further 2,400 jobs, while Norweb cut 280 jobs.
National Power, which cut 3,000 jobs in the year to March, said this was
part of a programme announced after privatisation, when it had around 17,000
staff. But it acknowledged it had revised proposed job cuts up from 5,000 to
8,000 last year.
Both companies said lower electricity prices depended on the negotiations
with British Coal, an important fuel supplier.
'Good progress has been made towards the sort of deal that will lead to real
term reductions in the electricity price,' said Mr John Baker, chief
executive of National Power.
And Mr Ken Harvey, Norweb chairman, said: 'We expect to keep our prices
below inflation next year. How far below depends on the coal deal.'

FT  17 JUN 92 / Germany to keep monetary policy tight
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW FISHER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE BUNDESBANK said yesterday it was determined to keep monetary policy
tight in the face of inflationary pressures.
A 'premature' easing could endanger the return to price stability in
Germany, it said.
In its monthly report, the German central bank said recent wage deals were
still too high in the light of reduced economic growth, although the average
5.5 per cent rise in key industrial sectors was less than last year's 7 per
cent.
Unit labour costs would rise by about 4 per cent this year, a level 'that is
not reconcilable with the aim of price stability', it said.
The Bundesbank held out the hope that wage deals would be more moderate next
year, noting that the settlement in the engineering industry included a
lower increase for 1993 than for this year.
Last year's wage rises probably affected the competitiveness of German
exporters, with foreign trade performance tending to damp the fairly
positive economic trend, it said.
Gross national product in west Germany was 2 per cent higher in the first
quarter than in the last quarter of 1991 on a seasonally adjusted basis.
This partly reflected mild winter weather and would not be repeated in the
second three months, but 'the economy is clearly headed upwards'.
Although inflation had retreated from its March peak of a 4.8 per cent
annual rate to 4.6 per cent in May, the bank said it was still too high.
Excluding energy prices and higher consumer taxes, prices were up by a more
modest 3.5 per cent. But, in the service and construction sectors, the rise
was about 6 per cent. 'This shows that considerable inflationary tensions
still exist,' the bank said.
Mistaken economic and wage policies could cause such pressures to spread to
other sectors. The bank said that last December's half point rise in
interest rates - to 8 per cent for the discount rate and 9.75 per cent for
the Lombard rate - had been urgently needed to combat inflation.
A continued loss of monetary stability would endanger growth and employment
as well as the process of integrating east Germany. The D-Mark's
international role also demanded inflationary vigilance.
'The decisions at Maastricht have strengthened the need to cut the German
inflation rate in view of European monetary integration,' the Bundesbank
report said.

FT  17 JUN 92 / Labour loss put down to poor image
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LABOUR'S much-awaited analysis of its general election defeat has concluded
that the campaign was lost because of its failure to project a vision of the
future and a 'very negative' attitude towards the Labour party even, among
its own supporters.
The party's policy mix, its tax plans, the 'Jennifer's ear' affair and the
controversial Sheffield rally had little bearing on the outcome when put
alongside deep-rooted fears of the consequences of a Labour victory.
The confidential report, drawn up by Mr Larry Whitty, the general secretary,
from more than 40 individual analyses of the campaign, will be debated at a
special meeting of the National Executive tomorrow.
Its conclusions appear to reverse the adage that 'governments lose
elections, oppositions do not win them'. Instead, it suggests that the
growing impression of a Labour victory drove thousands of undecided voters
into the Conservative camp.
In a key paragraph, Mr Whitty argues that Labour is seen as 'a party of the
past and one which holds back aspirations and tends to turn the clock back'.
While this was encouraged by the Tory-supporting tabloid newspapers, some
responsibility must be attributed to the tone of its policy platform which
'reflects a failure to project a strong enough forward and modernising
vision for Britain'.
He adds: 'At the end of the day, it was not just that the electorate could
not bring themselves to vote Labour; it was also that we failed to give them
a clear image of the future under Labour.'
The report comes alongside numerous other analyses, including Mr Neil
Kinnock's own conclusion, in a BBC television interview yesterday, that the
Labour party has failed to dispel the negative image created by internecine
warfare in the early 1980s.
Another inquiry, conducted by the GMB general union, has shown that Labour
improved its vote among union members by 4 per cent overall and has reversed
a decline to the Conservatives that occurred over the years of the Callaghan
government.
However, some NEC members are certain to contest some of Mr Whitty's
findings, drawn from qualitative polling of sample groups of floating
voters, conducted by the Shadow Communications Agency, Labour's image
consultant, after the election.
Ms Clare Short MP, an NEC absurd that such polling was conducted by the
consultancy, whose executives have been charged with relying too heavily on
poll findings and media 'glitz', and not enough on Labour's integrity as a
caring party.
It was no surprise the consultancy's conclusions were that it was Labour's
traditional image that was at fault, not the way the campaign was conducted,
Ms Short said.
Mr Whitty's report is certain to be seized on by Mr Bryan Gould, the shadow
environment secretary, as vindicating his claims that the party is not
confronting its failings with adequate rigour.

FT  17 JUN 92 / Foreign Affairs: End this Maastricht agony - Ireland should
follow Denmark and reject the treaty, because it is not federalist enough
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD MORTIMER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Jokes based on national stereotypes are usually in bad taste, and English
jokes about the Irish are among the worst. Yet it has to be said that the
Irish bishops, in advising their flock how to approach tomorrow's referendum
on the treaty of Maastricht, have lived up to English expectations. Their
argument can be summarised as follows:
1 'The substantive and fundamental issue is the right to life of the unborn
child.'
2 This will, whatever the outcome of tomorrow's vote, have to be settled by
another referendum, on a new amendment to the Irish constitution.
3 If Maastricht is approved, such an amendment may be ineffective.
4 If Maastricht is rejected, the issue will remain unresolved.
5 So decide for yourselves.
I am not a bishop, nor even a Roman Catholic, but I think I can do better
than that. The issue of the unborn child - unquestionably important though
it is - has nothing to do with the case. The Irish government itself took
great care to ensure that that would be so, by persuading its 11 partners to
accept a protocol saying that nothing in the treaty should be interpreted as
overriding the provisions of the Irish constitution on that matter.
Since then, Irish public opinion has been thrown into turmoil by the case of
the 14-year-old rape victim. At the time most people in Ireland seemed to
feel that she should be allowed to go abroad to have an abortion, and that
if Maastricht guaranteed the right of European Community citizens to travel
within the EC, then Irish citizens should not be excepted. Bowing to this
wave of public feeling, the Irish government asked its partners to rescind
the protocol, only to be told that as part of the treaty it was carved in
letters of stone and could not be changed.
But that whole argument was based on a false premise. The right of EC
nationals to be admitted to each other's countries is already guaranteed by
the Single European Act, and the right of Irish citizens to leave the
republic if they so wish is not dependent on anything to do with the EC at
all. It is guaranteed by the European Convention on Human Rights, which
binds all members of the Council of Europe. And since the Irish Republic
forms a passport union with the UK, there is in any case no way to stop
Irish citizens from going to the UK if they so wish, unless by subjecting
them to preventive arrest, which would surely infringe their rights under
other articles of the constitution.
Finally, the Irish supreme court decided that the rape victim could legally
have an abortion even within the republic, in spite of the constitutional
prohibition, on the grounds that her life was in danger. This decision had
nothing to do with Maastricht, and there is nothing in Maastricht that would
prevent the constitution being amended to close this loophole, if that is
what the Irish electorate really wants.
So, pace the bishops, tomorrow's referendum is not about the rights of the
unborn child. In fact, legally it may turn out to be about nothing at all,
since voters are being asked to ratify a treaty which can only come into
force if ratified by all 12 member states, and one of them has already
rejected it.
Politically, however, it is very important. If the Irish voters follow the
example of their Danish counterparts, Maastricht will be politically as well
as legally dead. It is inconceivable that the other 10 member states will
soldier on with the battle to ratify a treaty that two have already
rejected. Renegotiation will have become unavoidable.
If on the other hand the Irish vote 'yes', there is still a chance that some
way will be found of salvaging the treaty, either by so sugaring it with
interpretative declarations on subsidiarity that the Danes can be persuaded
to change their minds, or by working out some legal fix which would enable
11 members to implement the treaty, while Denmark's relations with them
continue to be governed by the pre-Maastricht rules.
Personally, being no more a lawyer than I am a bishop, I very much doubt if
either of these devices would work. But Maastricht itself is such a
monumental fudge, and so many powerful people have invested so much of their
reputations in it, that one should not rule out some even more grotesque
fudge being dreamt up to rescue it.
So, bishops or no bishops, I hope the Irish voters will find the courage to
strike the coup de grace, and put Maastricht out of its agony. Saying that
will probably lose me quite a few good friends, who thought of me - rightly
 -as a fellow 'European'; and will win me a lot of new ones, whose company I
shall not much relish. But the fact is that I have never much liked
Maastricht. It is not that it is too federalist, but that it is not
federalist enough, leaving too many decisions to be taken by committees of
national ministers behind closed doors, with no clear accountability.
I should like to see a European union with a federal constitution, in which
certain clearly defined powers would be exercised by a federal executive
responsible to a federal parliament, and everything else would be left to
member states, or indeed to smaller units of government - which, as I
understand it, is what 'subsidiarity' is all about. The federation would
have just enough power to ensure genuine freedom of movement for people,
goods and services within the geographical space that it covered, and to
conduct an effective common foreign and defence policy.
It has never been entirely clear to me whether such a union really needs a
single currency, but I am increasingly inclined to think not - or at least
that it should come only after a very high degree of economic convergence
has already come about, not by administrative fiat but through the operation
of market forces. Economic and monetary union in its Maastricht form -
essentially a Franco-Italian bid to hijack the D-Mark - looks to me
increasingly misguided, because it is all too likely to provoke a German
nationalist reaction, the beginnings of which we are now witnessing.
What I valued about Maastricht was that it at least attempted to bring about
a common foreign policy, and to make possible, through the Western European
Union, a common defence within the Atlantic alliance. But the machinery it
set up for this purpose would have needed to be improved before long. You
cannot run an effective foreign policy when every decision has to be agreed
by 12 separate governments, as the lamentable EC performance over Yugoslavia
has amply demonstrated. An enlarged community would be even more helpless
with this machinery. What is needed is a single foreign ministry, headed by
a politically accountable foreign minister.
I admit that I lacked the courage to condemn Maastricht outright, because I
feared that its failure would mark the victory of nationalism and might lead
to the fragmentation of the EC. I still fear that, but it need not be so. We
should start work as soon as possible on building a real European union -
one which knows what is and what is not its business, and can do its
business in an efficient manner, under democratic control.

Did Norman Lamont check with Welsh secretary David Hunt before abolishing
the National Economic Development Council?
The chancellor of the exchequer was adamant yesterday that there was no
place during the 1990s for the tripartite approach to economic management
which the NEDC had represented since its inception in the corporatist 1960s.
But Hunt seems to have other ideas.
He is busy setting up a new Welsh economic development council. It will
bring together Welsh industrialists, trade unionists and local authority
leaders to do just the job that NEDC was supposed to do for Britain. It is
hardly surprising that some at Westminster are beginning to mutter that Hunt
seems to be turning into more of a closet-socialist than his predecessor,
Peter Walker.

Malcolm Stephens's main regret on resigning last year as chief executive of
Britain's Export Credits Guarantee Department was that it stymied his
ambition to run the world's best export credit business. But he now means to
do the next-best thing - from September he will head the Berne Union, the
club for the world's top credit insurers.
True, given the Berne Union's traditional secrecy, Stephens might still end
up as the last thing he intended: a museum curator. Even so, the combative
record of the former diplomat and banker argues strongly for giving him the
benefit of the doubt.
After all, it took singular courage to resign from ECGD last November, so
signalling to government how much British industry resented its progressive
withdrawal of cash support for export efforts. Only six months before, the
government had privatised half of the ECGD by selling its short-term credit
operations to the Dutch.
His moving to the Berne Union comes at a time when the credit insurance
industry is set for radical reform. Both the European Commission and the
OECD are working on plans to harmonise export finance practices inter-
nationally: 'All of the Berne Union members are going through change, so it
seems inconceivable that the Berne Union itself can avoid changing,' he
declares, new-broomishly.

First Beirut and now the Falklands. What, it may be asked, has David Tatham,
Britain's ambassador in Beirut during last year's hostage releases, has done
to deserve the Falkland Islands' governorship?
The answer is that Tatham seems to be a one of a small but growing band of
Foreign Office folk who, believe it or not, are keen on the place. Before
Beirut, Tatham headed the Falkland Islands' department at the Foreign
Office, responsible for not only the islands but also Argentina. The
department was set up after the 1982 Anglo-Argentine war over the islands,
and closed when diplomatic ties were renewed in 1990.
Clearly the FO feels that the sensitivities of 2,000 sheep farmers bear
striking similarity to the byzantine world of Middle East affairs. Tatham is
taking over from William Fullerton, who is off to be our man in Kuwait.
Fullerton, leaving his cat Jason behind, says he is very sad to be
departing.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Has Liam Strong, Sears' newly-installed chief executive, fallen for the
Hanson mystique in making his first big appointment?
Stephen Park, his new finance director, certainly has an impressive CV. As a
former Hanson financial comptroller he should be well trained in what Hanson
does best - keeping a tight grip on costs and capital spending. He is also
Lord Hanson's personal assistant, so he should have a pretty good idea what
Britain's number one predator thinks about Sears - one of the London stock
market's favourite takeover targets.
Even so, some Hanson-watchers wonder whether Park is in quite the same class
as Chris Miller, Lord Hanson's previous PA - now in Wassall's driving seat -
or BET's new finance director Bob MacKenzie, another old student of the
Hanson school of financial management.
Park may not have long to prove himself. After all, it was only a year ago
that Lord Hanson told the FT that 'Allied-Lyons or Sears could be taken at
any time but we do not want to go for them.'

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Well done Austria. The cosy world of central banking will never be the same
again now the country's right-wing freedom party has made central bank
president Maria Schaumayer take a 25 per cent pay cut and end the promise of
lifelong jobs for her staff.
It's about time someone drew attention to the pay of the fat cats in
Europe's central banks. It is hard to imagine any other industry where
there's so great a need for a searching look at rewards. Sorting out the
variances between countries would cause nightmares to anyone still aspiring
to set up the problematical European central bank.
Admittedly, Schaumayer's case is rather extreme. Even after her pay cut, she
still gets ASch6m, or around Pounds 300,000 a year, which is five times as
much as Sweden's Bengt Dennis, and far more than either the Bank of
England's Leigh-Pemberton or the Bundesbank's Schlesinger.
The Austrian National Bank's staff is more feather-bedded than most, partly
because of the country's deep-rooted patronage system. Even so, it is well
nigh impossible to tell which of Europe's central banks give value for
money. While it's suspected that the Italians and French, like the
Austrians, are expensive, nobody has any way of being sure.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr CHRISTOPHER SOKOL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, When I joined Lloyd's in 1986 my agents and interviewer took great
pains to stress the real nature of the unlimited underwriting liability
which I was assuming. However, it was never suggested to me by anyone, nor
was it apparent from the literature I received, that I was also writing a
blank cheque to the Council of Lloyd's.
It may be the case that the council can properly increase the central fund
subscription in the way and for the purpose proposed without the Members'
consent, but it seems to me, as a matter of law, highly unlikely. In any
event I do not regard a rather unspecific statement by the Lloyd's chairman
that it is entitled to do so as sufficient.
With reluctance, therefore, I propose to decline to pay the levy unless and
until I am satisfied that I am under a legal obligation to do so.

FT  17 JUN 92 / Leading Article: So farewell then Neddy
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
NOTHING IN the turbulent lifetime of Britain's National Economic Development
Council has surprised so much as the manner and timing of its abolition.
Had Neddy been despatched rather than mutilated by Mrs Thatcher and her
Chancellor Nigel Lawson in 1987, no one would have wondered at the
government's motives. As it is, with a more pragmatic prime minister in
Downing Street and the most interventionist boss at the Department of Trade
and Industry since 1979, there is much speculation about the temperature of
the discussion which led to yesterday's announcement. Mr Michael Heseltine,
after all, is on record as favouring a strengthened Neddy.
Ministers yesterday claimed there had been no disagreement, while some
officials detected Treasury retaliation in advance of Mr Heseltine finding
time to pump up the organisation. Still others observed cunning in the
actions of the president of the Board of Trade in taking industry-government
relations more firmly under his own wing.
There will, however, be few mourners at the passing of an organisation which
has struggled for 30 years to find an apt role in the British scheme of
things.
Neddy began in 1962 as Harold Macmillan's answer to the French Commisariat
du Plan, degenerated under the Wilson government to the slapstick
incompetence of Labour's National Plan, before having its heart burned out
by the failures of Labour's social contract and the attack upon the
principle of even moderate northern European-style tripartism by Mrs
Thatcher.
More vacuous
During the Thatcher years, the full National Economic Development Council
met less frequently and spoke more vacuously. It was for the most part a
true dialogue of the deaf, failing to exercise serious influence upon
critical matters, such as pay-setting procedures, or even microeconomic
concerns, like the crisis in training.
Even in its reduced state, however, the National Economic Development
Office, the organisation's combined secretariat and think tank, continued to
produce reports on supply side matters and on individual industrial sectors.
At their worst, these reports resembled lobbying briefs by trade
associations; at their best, they provided well-researched conclusions which
influenced the industrialists and trade union leaders who had co-operated in
their construction.
Treasury's grasp
It was not clear from Mr Heseltine's words yesterday how he sees the
post-Neddy world. There will be no more regular formal meetings, no comment
on macroeconomic matters now again securely in the Treasury's grasp and
probably, he suggested, not much dialogue with trade unionists. He will,
however, talk to business as he thinks fit and is re-organising his
department along more sectoral lines which may well increase the
effectiveness of this process.
Two main drawbacks are immediately visible. The new arrangements will be
conducted in the privacy of Mr Heseltine's salon and so research will
presumably be carried out by or at the behest of the government machine and
will be published if and when it suits government. This is a small but
noteworthy step away from more open government and pluralistic thinking and
one which will need to be remedied. The case for an independent council of
economic advisers, a German-style panel of 'wise men' and/or an independent
central bank equipped to provide relief from the errors which have
characterised the Treasury's judgment in recent years is stronger than ever
now that Neddy is to die.
Second, by avoiding the involvement of organised labour in his
deliberations, Mr Heseltine's endeavours will be denied the possibility of
that commonality of purpose which Neddy has sometimes fostered. Managers, of
course, bear the main responsibility for communicating with their companies'
employees, but the British economy remains one bedevilled by delusion, not
least in the area of pay.
Neddy may well have been something of a pantomime cart horse in the 30-year
war to establish a British economy capable of low inflation and steady
growth, but the load it was born to pull is still there.

Maisie, that archetypal feminist from 'The Perishers' in the Daily Mirror,
used to ask the boys acidly 'Are we in the hit-ball season or the kick-ball
season?' but the question seems to be losing its significance. Today, well
into the hit-ball season, television is dominated by kick-ball. Starting at
7.00 BBC1 devotes 2 1/2 hours to live coverage of England v Sweden in
Stockholm with a look also at the Denmark/France game in Malmo. Then at
11.20 ITV begins 70 minutes of recorded highlights from the same matches.
For those who find a sport that specialises in nil-nil draws less than
electrifying, Radio 3 seems the best alternative. Third Ear (7.05) plunges
into the debate about scientific theories on matters such as the origins of
the universe and asks whether quasi-religious hogwash is replacing proper
physics. Then in The World is Out of Joint (9.30) Peter Moore of King's
College London attempts a summary of the world's ecological state after the
Rio pantomime.
Lovers of the classics can hear the William Tell Overture, Grieg's Piano
Concerto, and Beethoven's Fifth in Radio Goes To Town at 7.30.

FT  17 JUN 92 / Arts: Queen of Spades - Opera
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAX LOPPERT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
At Glyndebourne, this opera comes across with overwhelming force. It was
given at the festival in the 1971 season, with fair success; now, the sum of
Graham Vick's new production, Andrew Davis's conducting of the (magnificent)
London Philharmonic, and the singing and acting of a carefully chosen cast
is, I think, a milestone in festival history. An opera written for a large
Russian theatre and re-deploying the structural machinery of 18th- and
19th-century operatic spectacle discloses here all its heart-rending
secrets. The loss of acoustic and physical space matters relatively little,
while the close focus on details of Tchaikovsky's musical dramatisation
brings thrills and revelations in uncountable number.
The 'psychological' messages sent to the audience from the lower depths of
the orchestra (in particular the bassoon and low clarinet parts, superbly
well delivered by LPO principals) needle their way into our perception of
the characters with a quiet insidiousness that proves irresistible. (Will
these close-up effects be possible in the new, enlarged Glyndebourne theatre
shortly to be built? Fervent prayers are required, starting now.)
Everything about the music communicates, makes sense, adds up: the frisson
of repeated accompaniment figures, the wallop and flash of emotional thunder
and lightning, the fraught sweep of the whole canvas. An opera formerly held
to be loosely constructed, with numbers and whole sequences ripe for easy
removal, is given absolutely complete, and drives its points home with
riveting insistence.
The special greatness of Queen of Spades lies in large part in the balance
Tchaikovsky sustains between outward opulence and inward turbulence,
luxuriance and high-Romantic passion. At Monday's opening performance Mr
Davis's expert conducting, so sensitive to his singers, seemed to lean a
touch in the direction of the former - there was much lovingly moulded
lyrical phrasing, also a slight shortage of the demonic in the accompanying
undercurrents. He will surely grow into the opera; the production, which at
Monday's opening revealed untidinesses of ensemble in the opening scene, is
likewise bound to move ever more authoritatively as it wears in.
Already it seems to me a quite marvellous and brilliant piece of modern
music-theatre. It has been planned, by Mr Vick, the designer Richard Hudson
and the lighting designer Thomas Webster, with fastidious intelligence to
look - as the opera itself does - both forward and backward: to deal in
unsensational yet toughly argued theatrical terms with the 'psychodrama' at
the heart of the opera while not neglecting the picturesque elements, the
influences of Tchaikovsky's beloved Mozart and Carmen, the delicate touches
of rococo filigree.
Psychodramatic accounts of this opera may have been the fashion in recent
years, but they take an audience only part of the way toward the opera's
core. Mr Vick proves his fuller understanding of it by staging the pastoral
divertissement, with the help of Ron Howell's delicious mock-authentic
dances, with a touch of gentle comedy that never turns into send-up. The
whole of the ball scene, indeed, is admirably precise in its purpose: a
great golden staircase falls from the flies to suggest the St Petersburg
glitter that so drives and torments the outsider Hermann, and around it
ironic reflections of the opera's main plot-points are deftly thrown.
The look of the production pinpoints a poetically knife-edged duality.
Costume is period, the set semi-abstract modern. White walls, kinked in
perspective and daubed with furious Gerald Scarfe-like black ink-scratches,
funnel the eye toward a 'black hole' at the back - an image of Hermann's
madness that grows ever more potent as the show unfolds. The gambling
finale, with hellish skeleton figures pressing through cavities, forms a
daringly conceived yet (in the terms of this production) perfectly logical
conclusion, a final fusion of spectacle and phantasmagoria; and before that
point, scene after scene has been directed with acute insight into the
mainspring of each character.
Every small part is made telling - of all the many vivid players who deserve
a brief mention, Graeme Matheson-Bruce (Chekalinsky), Enid Hartle
(Governess) and Anne Dawson (Chloe) demand to be singled out. Louise Winter
sings Pauline's elegy with lovely warmth and purity; the two baritones -
Sergey Leiferkus as the most elegant and vocally commanding of Tomskys,
Dmitry Kharitonov as a soft-grained, notably stylish Yeletsky - are
excellent individually and in contrast. Nancy Gustafson, her shining lyric
soprano in mint condition, has done nothing better than this Lisa: no
passive figure she, but a girl who simultaneously grows to womanhood and
tragic stature.
The two great narcissists at the opera's centre are confronted with rare and
chilling exactitude. Felicity Palmer's old Countess - cold, selfish yet with
an aura of mesmerising radiance to her song-murmurings  - proves all the
more compelling for being so rigorously underplayed. The area of controversy
likely to be aroused by this Glyndebourne performance concerns the Hermann
of Yury Marusin. He has what the Italians call a 'fixed tenor', of power and
sometimes impressively dark intensity but little beauty, which seems to fall
worryingly often on the flat side of notes and phrases. Yet so ferociously
unsparing and wholehearted is his plummeting toward madness, so free of
gibbering-loony cliche, that his vocal shortcomings end up by counting for
amazingly little.
Sponsored by Johnson Matthey; in repertory at Glyndebourne until July 23.

FT  17 JUN 92 / Arts: Socialism, and other old jokes - Television
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER DUNKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BBC2's new Thursday night series Pandora's Box has, according to its
billing, a fascinating purpose: 'To explore the cultural impact of 20th
century science' using 'archive clips from feature films, cartoons, and home
movies'. Furthermore, the opening programme was fascinating in some ways,
yet also deeply irritating because although it kept claiming to be about
science and the failure of science, it was actually about socialism and the
failure of socialism (or sometimes sociology and the failure of sociology).
The trap which the programme dug for itself was clear from the start when we
were told 'To those who began the revolution in Russia 75 years ago, science
was a grand liberating force. They believed Karl Marx had discovered the
scientific laws of society which they would now use to unlock the gates to a
new world where everyone would be equal and free'.
In that one paragraph science and politics have already been clumsily
conflated, and semantically matters went downhill from there. The cynical
might say that this seemed like the last gasp of the fellow traveller,
desperately seeking to blame the dramatic failure of communism on poor old
science: because Soviet engineers and technocrats were involved in the The
Plan, and The Plan failed, science was blamed for the failure when it was
actually state centralisation which was to blame.
Even if you reject the cynical reaction you are left with the depressing
willingness of this programme to make common cause with the current
frightening movement towards anti-rationalism. It is one thing for
Californian hippies and teenage greenies to raise a cacophony of eco-babble
and 'new age' superstition, seeking to substitute astrology and aromatherapy
for science (which, after all, simply means a rational approach to the
unknown) but we expect something more level headed from BBC2 documentaries.

Among the '3,000 selections, old and new' in Everybody's Book Of Jokes on
the shelf in my bathroom is this one: 'I've read so much about the evils of
drinking that I've decided to give up reading'. That joke was told in the
first edition of a new series of The Comedians on ITV on Tuesday last week.
The cover of my edition of Everybody's Book Of Jokes says 'Retorts, Bulls,
Jests, Rhymes, Conundrums, Anecdotes, &amp; Puns, London, Saxon &amp; Co, Cloth 6d,
Leather 1s, 120th Thousand'. It was printed in 1890.
* * *
Those straws in the wind, identified here last week as the harbingers of the
new, rougher age of market-driven competition in British television, keep on
coming. This week we hear that Channel 4, the network for minorities, is to
re-launch its breakfast show. And how will it fulfil that famous statutory
requirement to 'be different'?  Will it differ from TV-am and BBC1 by
concentrating on non-metropolitan material? No. Given television's current
obsession with 'yoof', will it offer a service for the big and largely
ignored growth area, the middle aged and elderly who have most of the
disposable income that advertisers love? No.
What then? The producer will be Charlie Parsons, late of that archetypal
yoof series The Word, and the star presenters will be teen idol Bob Geldof
and trendy yoof presenter Paula Yates, one-time Penthouse model and, of
course, Geldof's wife.
* * *
Before that arrives some time in September, we shall be seeing the BBC's new
soap opera, Eldorado. Though intended for the autumn season, this has been
pulled forward to the first week in July in the hope, it is said, of
avoiding it being swamped by all the other new autumn material. Not so long
ago the BBC considered itself superior to the sort of broadcaster that used
soap to pull down the big ratings.  Then, in 1985, came the twice weekly
EastEnders, to be joined in 1988 by Neighbours, imported from Australia and
shown twice every weekday.  Now here comes Eldorado, with its famous Pounds
10m price tag, shot in a purpose-built hamlet in Spain and due for
transmission on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays. This will take BBC1's soap
output to 17 units a week and, if Eldorado is repeated, as seems likely, 20.
Haystacks indeed.
* * *
Not all the conclusions in last week's column were borne out this week,
however. C4's new topical comment series A Stab In The Dark (don't say
satire or mention TW3 ) was considerably better second time round. David
Baddiel even had a go at the tedium of feminist comedy, with its endless
repetition of 'I just find male genitalia funny'.  After all the years of
'little willie' gags from this lot perhaps Baddiel could start a few about
the vast capaciousness of feminist comics.
* * *
Time was when television drama meant either the single play or a good meaty
serial running for 13 weeks or so. Now every broadcaster is said to want
mini-series, so almost everything you see lasts for three or four hours.
BBC1's Natural Lies, which ran across the last three Sunday evenings, lasted
only 2 hours 45 minutes, but no doubt foreign broadcasters will strip it
across the week in six half-hour slots, or over the weekend in two 90-minute
slots.
It was one of those 'Everyone's in league against me' stories with Bob Peck
playing the man who, even with police, government departments, and old
friends all conspiring, is determined to get to the bottom of things.
'Things' on this occasion were . . . well, very meaty actually: BSE got into
the human food chain, and a man died. Before transmission there were
protests from those with vested interests, but given the slight uncertainty
about BSE developments in the long term it seemed a reasonable enough scare
story; sometimes it is right to be scared. Not that it will stop me eating
steak, though I might be put off if I had to see that glassy-eyed stare of
agony from Peck again this year.
* * *
ITV's four-hour drama The Guilty was shown on successive nights, wrapped
around News At 10. I find this system with its half-hour compulsory news
break annoying even though I would usually watch the news. I prefer my drama
uninterrupted. On such occasions the question is whether it is really worth
setting up the VCR to record all four bits, given that, however careful you
may be, some clown of a scheduler will ensure that one part, containing a
crucial clue, will start early or end late and miss your tape.
This time the story was of a boozy barrister (Michael Kitchen, world weary
and excellent as ever) who rapes a new young secretary just before being
created the youngest judge in the country; like so much recent television
drama it left a sour taste in the mouth. However, Colin Gregg's direction
showed the sort of flair for urban nightscapes that we have come to
associate with modern French cinema thrillers.
* * *
What a wonderfully enjoyable South Bank Show this week on the making of the
Beatles' 'Sgt Pepper' album. For some reason nothing in the world feels
quite so nostalgically ancient as the music of your own youth, but the chief
attraction of this programme was the extraordinarily detailed guided tour
through the original master tapes by producer George Martin. This was an
outstanding example of just how successful television can be at illustrating
and analysing popular contemporary culture.

FT  17 JUN 92 / Sperryn adds his voice to London chamber
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It took Simon Sperryn, chief executive of the Manchester Chamber of
Commerce, only two weeks to complete the negotiations which led to
yesterday's announcement that he is to become chief executive of the London
Chamber of Commerce and Industry.
Sperryn who, apart from one short break in industry, has spent his entire
working life working for a chamber, was approached at short notice to
replace Malcolm Stephens, who is leaving the London chamber in September
after 10 months. (See Observer, Page 21.)
Although the London chamber is larger than its Manchester counterpart -
3,500 members against 2,800 and 115 staff compared with 75 - many of the
problems are the same.
Greater Manchester, like London, has no strategic planning body, so the
Manchester chamber has had to deal with 10 local authorities just as London
has to deal with 33 local boroughs. The chamber and Training and Enterprise
Council movements are also fragmented in both metropolitan areas; Greater
Manchester is served by no fewer than seven Tecs and seven chambers.
Attempts to rationalise this splintered business support network have had
some success in Manchester. The 10 chambers of commerce in the north west of
England and Wales are forming a federation with the ultimate prospect of a
merger. This may prove more difficult in London where there are strong
traditional rivalries between the local chambers.
Asked about the most significant achievements of the Manchester chamber
during his six-year tenure, Sperryn highlights the forging of links between
schools and industry in a local 'compact' and the creation of the Greater
Manchester visitor and convention bureau to promote the area.
An amateur singer, Sperryn, 46, has also been chairman of the Manchester
Camerata, a freelance chamber orchestra. He also lists drawing, riding and
reading among his leisure interests.

FT  17 JUN 92 / Management: How back pain can make you lose your marbles -
Health Check
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Dr MICHAEL MCGANNON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mention back pain to a group of managers, and you will set off a deluge of
personal horror stories. Anyone who thinks bad backs are reserved for those
who make a living moving pianos should think again. According to the journal
Spine, more than 80 per cent of people in industrialised countries suffer
from back pain at some point in their lives.
The more sedentary you are, the greater the risk of severe back trouble.
Back pain does not just reduce your mobility on the tennis court and up the
career ladder, it is also expensive for your employers. In the US alone,
back ailments are the second leading cause for going into hospital (after
pregnancy), cost industry Dollars 14bn (Pounds 7.6bn) a year and 93m lost
working days.
The back is a complicated structure: 33 vertebral bodies, the boney building
blocks, are stacked on top of each other.
Between them are rubbery, fluid-filled discs, which cushion the weight of
the upper body. Then there are the muscles (roughly 140) and ligaments,
which hold the spine erect in a natural, flattened S-curve, the optimum
shape for flexibility, weight bearing and shock absorption.
As long as the concave curve in the lower back is preserved, the disc can
usually tolerate the compression that comes from the pressure of the body's
weight.
Problems begin when you eliminate that inward curve of the lower back by
habitually bending forward, thus compressing the disc backwards.
The technological advances of this century - TV, the telephone, computers
and cars - have all contributed to the current epidemic of back problems.
All involve the worst possible activity for the back: long-term sitting.
But even if you spend most of your time on your backside, there are ways of
avoiding back trouble.
Regular aerobic exercise is crucial to maintain strength of the back
muscles. Brisk walking is ideal. Complement these activities with some
night-time stretching or yoga.
Get rid of that pot belly and get your weight under control. Added weight
distributed up front will only put more strain on the back muscles. The
spine gets most of its support from the massive abdominal musculature, not
the back muscles themselves. Tone up the abdominal muscles by flexing them
while sitting on aircraft or driving.
Lift objects properly. Perform the 'marble test'. In the morning, put a
marble in your breast pocket. During the day, if the marble rolls out of
your pocket, it is because you bent over, instead of squatting to pick
something up. Let your legs do the bending. When lifting, keep the object
very close to your body.
In your car or at your desk, sit up and avoid stooping. During the day,
tense your abdominal muscles to give them them the strength they need to
support your back. Make sure your chair supports your lower back well.
When travelling or shopping, divide the weight of your bags evenly so as not
to strain one side more than the other.
While driving long hauls, keep your knees higher than your pelvis. Maintain
the natural curve of your spine by placing a cushion or a rolled-up towel
behind your lower back to lend support. Do not twist your body getting in
and out of your car. Re-align your back every hour or so by standing,
placing your hands in the lower back and bending backwards.
Sleep on a firm bed, on your side with the top leg bent and bottom leg
straight.
Women should not wear high heels, as they throw the back into an unnatural
position.
If despite all this you do develop back pain, there is a whole array of
therapies - massage, manipulation, acupuncture, ultrasound, deep heat,
traction, shoe inserts, and surgery. The bad news is that none of these is
100 per cent successful. The good news is that most back pain subsides
eventually, regardless of approach, with bed rest, aspirin and time.

FT  17 JUN 92 / Management: Setting standards for the working classes - A
look at the Investors in People scheme / Training on Trial
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In 1868, a Royal Commission noted that Britain was suffering from 'not
merely a deficiency in technical education but . . . in general
intelligence'.
In the intervening 124 years, governments have made numerous efforts to do
something about it. The latest attempt is Investors in People, launched two
years ago, but still surrounded in confusion.
Conceived by the National Training Task Force, which advises the government
on training, and gestated by the Department of Employment, it is now passing
to harassed Training and Enterprise Councils.
IiP - as we must now learn to call it - is a standard which represents, as a
Birmingham Tec guide has it, 'a benchmark against which employers can
measure their progress in developing effective employee training and
development policies.' The underlying appeal to business of IiP is the
effect on the bottom line.
'The real pay-back . . . will come if you look at training in the same way
as any other investment. You target it to meet specific business needs,'
says the official literature.
Cynics might claim this is just another injunction to business, longer on
rhetoric than on reason.
Certainly the Tecs have no illusion about the size of the task. Underlying
IiP are targets agreed by government, educators and business that by the
year 2000, half of the employed workforce should be qualified to level three
of the National Vocation Qualification or its academic equivalent. By 1996,
half of the medium-sized and larger organisations in the UK should have
attained the IiP standard.
To reach it, companies have to follow four principles. They must make a
public commitment to develop all employees to reach specified corporate
objectives. They must regularly review all training and development needs
and identify the resources for this in their business plan. They must act to
train employees when they are recruited and subsequently. They should
continually evaluate their training and development, revising targets and
commitments.
'If we don't do it, we will not be in business in a few years time,'
suggested one Tec chief executive at a recent IiP brainstorming conference
in Windsor called by Full Employment UK, a training consultancy. But, as it
emerged at this conference, the immediate auguries are not promising.
IiP may be the umbrella under which everything else sits, but it does not
yet offer shelter to many companies. The IiP standard, unveiled in November
1990, had by May been reached by just 54 companies. In Birmingham, only
eight organisations are working towards it. In Manchester, 82 companies out
of a possible 36,000 are going through the IiP system.
IiP has not yet found a place in the training and investment market place.
Bill Nicholls, a training specialist at the Engineering Employers Federation
says companies display one of three attitudes towards IiP. About 90 per cent
greet the mention of IiP with the question: 'I-I What?' Of the remaining 10
per cent, some look at the standard with enthusiasm because they want a
kitemark. Others say they already have a training policy, and they prefer to
press on as they are.
Companies which have grasped the training nettle have a variety of ways to
win public acclaim.
They can work for the British Standards Institution's BS5750, which contains
a training element.
They can seek to win a National Training Award, applications for which have
recently been widely advertised by the Department of Employment.
They can be seen to be taking part in local programmes - Birmingham Tec's
Investment for Skills, for example.
However, there is confusion among companies over which route to take and
most Tecs are in no position to offer clarification.
This springs partly from the structure of their budgets.
IiP is just an add-on to the training budget and one Tec chief executive
described it as a product 'worked up on the hoof as we have had the job of
trying to deliver it'.
The scale of effort and funding directed at the sale of IiP to recession-hit
companies has been highly variable from one Tec to another. The variations
imply uncertain priorities.
If, it was suggested at Windsor, nearly 90 per cent of the national
workforce at the end of the century is already working, there is a case for
putting more of a Tec budget behind IiP for the employed, rather than
seeking to train the unemployed.
The retort from Tecs in areas of high unemployment, is that care for the
jobless come first; if there is to be stress on IiP, there should be
separate money for it.
Even if this dilemma is resolved, the Tecs are still confused about how, and
to whom, IiP should be marketed. The conference indicated concern about
internal Tec staff development: in 1992, few Tecs would be able to reach the
IiP standard they are concerned to see others adopt.

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
INVESTIGATORS on both sides of the Atlantic are trying to discover whether
any Maxwell group pension funds were among the more than Dollars 200m
(Pounds 107.7m) transferred last year from Maxwell private and public
companies to the Daily News, Robert Maxwell's New York newspaper.
The inquiry is related to claims filed in New York bankruptcy court seeking
the recovery of a total of Dollars 210.4m of funds allegedly transferred to
Daily News accounts at the Chase Manhattan bank.
The Daily News has denied any wrongdoing and Mr Marc Kirschner, a lawyer for
the newspaper, yesterday called the newspaper 'an innocent pawn in this
thing'.
Conversations with two executives involved in some of the fund transfers
suggest an atmosphere of confusion and mystery in New York about both the
sources and destination of the money just two weeks before Maxwell's death
on November 5 last year.
The executives told the FT that. during a visit by Maxwell to New York in
October 1991, at least Dollars 86m of money arrived at the Daily News
accounts from Mirror Group Newspapers (MGN) in London and was ordered by
Maxwell to be sent on to a number of US and foreign banks.
Court records show that the Dollars 86m came from an MGN loan from the
London office of Bankers Trust, the US bank.
Court documents also show that the Dollars 210.4m of claims filed against
the Daily News include:
A claim by MGN for Dollars 90.5m, consisting of the Dollars 86m loan plus
interest, and a further claim for Dollars 24.2m of funds that may have come
from MGN. A third claim, of Dollars 1.7m, relates to a transfer made by
MGN's Racing Times subsidiary in the US to the Daily News.
Four separate claims made by Arthur Andersen, the administrators of Maxwell
private companies, totalling Dollars 94m. The largest are a Dollars 64.2m
claim on behalf of Robert Maxwell Group PLC and a Dollars 29.8m claim on
behalf of London and Bishopsgate Group Limited.
Mr George White, a former managing director of Sporting Life who was
president of MGN's Racing Times in the US between April 1991 and February
1992, was disturbed because 'the money was coming from weird places'.
Mr White added: 'I raised the question in London as to why we at Racing
Times weren't getting our money directly from the Mirror Group. I was told
not to ask, that it was anybody's guess.'
He said that Mr Maxwell personally co-ordinated a number of fund transfers,
often asking newcomers to execute his wishes. 'They hadn't become aware of
his tricks. It all fitted in with the old man's strategy of keeping people
in the dark.'

or three times the rate of inflation - since water companies were
privatised, Labour claimed yesterday, urging the government to give greater
priority to consumers' interests.
Ms Ann Taylor, shadow environment spokesman, attacked the government for
treating water as a marketable commodity rather than a 'vital natural
resource'.
The actual price increases compared with government predictions that water
prices would rise by between 7.5 per cent and 12.5 per cent by the end of
the century, she said, opening an Opposition debate on water since
privatisation.
The Labour motion expressed alarm at the 'record profits, record dividends
and record salaries and perks of top management in the water companies',
especially at a time when households were facing record bills.
Mr David Maclean, environment minister, ruled out intervention to curb the
increased charges, and accused Labour of 'not having the nous to realise
that there is no investment without profits'.
Privatisation had overcome the handicap of severe under-investment over 20
to 30 years, he said, praising the privatised companies for their Pounds
28bn investment programme.
The motion fell by 274-317, a government majority of 43.

FT  17 JUN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Tower in US S&amp;L Maxwell connection
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
ROBERT MAXWELL used former Senator John Tower to seek US government
assistance for an aborted attempt in 1988 to acquire 15 insolvent Texas
savings-and-loans institutions, according to a former US bank regulatory
official.
Tower, who died in an air crash last year, was a paid consultant to Maxwell
and served on the board of Macmillan, the publisher owned by Maxwell
Communication Corporation (MCC).
In August 1988 Senator Tower went to see Mr Danny Wall, then chairman of the
Federal Home Loan Bank Board, the now-defunct agency that previously
regulated the US savings-and-loan industry.
The former Texan Senator met Mr Wall to argue on behalf of a bid by Maxwell
for 15 failing savings-and-loan institutions that were later declared
insolvent, sold as a single package and renamed the Bluebonnet Savings Bank.
A Congressional investigator claimed at the weekend that 'Maxwell hired
Tower to try and grease the savings-and-loan deal', but Mr Wall, who
resigned in March 1990, said he saw 'nothing nefarious' in Tower's approach.

FT  17 JUN 92 / Parliament and Politics: PM warns schools on standards
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SCHOOLS that perform poorly will face a choice between being helped to
improve by teams of teachers coming in from outside, or being shut down, Mr
John Major signalled yesterday.
In his first post-election address on domestic policies, the prime minister
also made clear that his desire to see change in the social agenda included
housing and law and order, and was not confined to the higher-profile areas
of education and health.
That development of his campaign themes of the 'right to own, the power to
choose' came in a speech last night to the Adam Smith Institute, the
free-market think tank.
In a look ahead to the white paper on schools which is due to be published
later in the summer, Mr Major promised radical proposals for schools -
particularly in inner cities - where the independent inspectorate of schools
found standards were far too low.
'I do not believe that government can stand indefinitely by. If the
governors or the local authority are unwilling or unable to put things
right, then we must find ways to raise standards for the children in them,'
he said.
Drawing on his own experiences, as he did increasingly in his campaign
speeches, Mr Major recalled his childhood among people who did not have much
money but who still wanted to be independent, and said that the task for the
1990s was to widen the avenue of choice. 'We mean to empower not just the
enterprising, but all people - the least well off  - those most dependent on
public services as well.'
In a scarcely veiled reference to the tone of some Tory rhetoric of the
1980s, the prime minister emphasised his view that reform had to start at
the top, and that if people did feel dependent that was the fault of
government and others in authority who arrogantly behaved as if they knew
best.
'I don't want to hear any more carping about the faults of the dependent,'
he said. Government had made people dependent 'not because we provide the
welfare and the services, but by denying people the basic human dignity of
independent choice in the way they are provided'.
While education and health were at the forefront of the Tory election
campaign emphasis on extending choice and opportunity, Mr Major's speech
highlighted the need to extend further the government's plans to bring more
choice into home ownership and into the public and private rented sectors.
He said that the government wanted policing that would be more responsive to
public concerns.

FT  17 JUN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Lamont takes tough line on interest
rate cut
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR NORMAN LAMONT last night flatly rejected calls from some Conservative MPs
for an immediate cut in interest rates to speed up the pace of economic
recovery.
In a tough speech to members of the Conservative backbench finance
committee, the chancellor also insisted that there could be no question of
any devaluation of sterling within the European Exchange Rate Mechanism.
Responding to disquiet among many Tory MPs that the April election victory
has not brought the promised recovery, Mr Lamont appeared to acknowledge
that the Treasury had downgraded its growth forecasts for this year.
MPs at the meeting said that he had left the impression that the economy was
likely to be flat this year rather than growing by the 1 per cent predicted
in his March budget. But Mr Lamont sought to quash speculation that he is
under pressure from the prime minister and cabinet colleagues to 'kick
start' the economy with an early cut in interest rates.
He told the MPs that the government had refused to 'play politics' with the
economy in spite of the pressures it faced in the run-up to the general
election. To take a short-term view now would be entirely illogical and
would risk the medium-term rewards promised by the present tough stance
against inflation.
He warned also that such determination to judge the economy's performance
over a period of years rather than months would mean tough constraints on
key public-spending programmes during the present round of Whitehall
negotiations.
In spite of his reputation as the cabinet's most important Euro-sceptic, Mr
Lamont was careful not to support calls from some MPs for the government to
abandon the goal of a single currency enshrined in the threatened Maastricht
treaty. He told the meeting that the Danish vote against the treaty called
for a period of 'cool reflection' but highlighted the benefits of the ERM
and the potential gains from a single currency.

FT  17 JUN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Row over Kinnock Euro job
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LABOUR'S ambivalent response to the Danish 'no' vote on the Maastricht
treaty ended Mr Neil Kinnock's hopes of becoming president of Confederation
of Socialist Parties of European Communities, it was claimed last night.
But while Mr George Robertson, Labour's European affairs spokesman, insisted
last night that the outgoing leader's decision to withdraw his candidature
was his alone, socialist group officials in Brussels said there was mounting
opposition to his candidature from the Germans and French.
Both sides agree that it was equivocation by Labour MPs and the leadership
in Westminster last week over ratification of the treaty that, in effect,
halted Mr Kinnock's election to the prestigious post.
'As soon as the Danish vote came through Kinnock's chances were over,' a
socialist group official said. 'The Dutch were continuing to support him,
but the lack of clarity of Labour's views on Maastricht made his position
impossible.'
The official added that there was wide-ranging irritation within the group
at Labour's 'lack of seriousness' on the Maastrict agreement which is firmly
backed by all the other members of the confederation.
There is now a move to draft Mr Willy Claes, the Belgian foreign minister,
Mr Antonio Guiterres, the Portuguese socialist leader or Mr Frank van der
Broeken, a Flemish socialist to take the post.
A Labour party official in London confirmed that European socialist parties
had 'great difficulty' in understanding how Britain's parliamentary system
worked and the requirement on MPs, including former leaders, to accept party
discipline.
There seems little doubt that Labour's current refusal to vote in support of
ratification of the Maastricht accord is damaging its carefully-nurtured
relations with other European socialist parties.
Further evidence of Labour's difficulties emerged yesterday when Mr Kinnock
appeared to shift position by refusing to rule out backing for a British
referendum on the treaty.

FT  17 JUN 92 / Parliament and Politics: MP seeks publication of Imro report
on Maxwell
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN and RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR FRANK FIELD, the Labour MP who is leading the campaign for compensation
for Maxwell pensioners, will today ask Mr John Major to publish a
confidential report on the regulatory supervision of Maxwell companies.
The secret report produced by Imro, the self-regulatory body for the fund
management industry, is critical of its own performance over the Maxwell
affair and the professional advisers who were in a position to warn
regulators.
Mr Field, chairman of the select committee on social security which held
hearings on the Maxwell affair, will deliver a letter to Downing Street
today.
The Imro report has already been sent to the Securities and Investments
Board, the City's chief watchdog. The SIB and the Treasury, the government
department responsible for City affairs, are anxious to see the document
published but are concerned that parts of it may be libellous.
The report criticises Imro's own failure to concentrate on companies of high
risk. But it also points out that the trustees, directors and a range of
professional advisers, including auditors, failed to alert regulators to
irregularities dating as far back as two years before Mr Maxwell's death.
Mr Field said his committee concluded that the auditors to the Maxwell
pension schemes were in a better position than any professional adviser to
spot irregularities.
Liquidators are examining the audited report for the year to April 1990 of
Bishopsgate Investment Management, the Maxwell-owned company which managed
the pension funds of other Maxwell companies.
That report notes a share-lending agreement between BIM and Lehman Brothers,
the US-based investment house. Coopers &amp; Lybrand, BIM's auditor, said it
acted properly in approving the accounts. Securities firms frequently borrow
shares from institutional fund managers for very short periods in exchange
for collateral and a commission.
As required by Stock Exchange rules, the shares were lent through a licensed
money broker, Shearson Lehman Equity Money Brokers. It was accompanied by a
share lending agreement and Coopers confirmed that collateral was held.
Coopers, however, said that the shares were lent for an indefinite period
unlike most stock lending which is done for one day at a time.
Coopers was auditor to all the Maxwell companies and pension funds, apart
from the Liechtenstein trusts. To protect client confidentiality, it had
four separate teams working on different parts of the Maxwell group. The
firm said none of these teams communicated with one another.
The last audit of the pension funds was for the period ending in April 1990.
Most of the pension funds' eventual losses of Pounds 448m appear to have
occurred after that date.
The April 1990 audit report was not completed until April 1991. Coopers says
the 12-month lag is within the timetable recommended by the Occupational
Pensions Board and that pension fund accounts normally take longer than
public company accounts to be finalised.
The audit for the year to April 1991 never took place. Maxwell extended the
audit period to December 1991, a gap of 21 months.
Coopers says it pressed for interim accounts in July 1991 and complained
that 21 months was too long a gap.

FT  17 JUN 92 / Plans row threatens lift-truck producer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FUTURE of UK manufacturing at Lancer Boss Group, the biggest
British-owned lift-truck producer, is at stake because of a green-belt
planning row that came to a head yesterday.
Boss workers at Leighton Buzzard, Bedfordshire, where the company has
manufactured lift trucks since 1959, are worried that objections to a plan
to build a manufacturing plant in the town might force the company to
relocate manufacturing overseas.
That would threaten 300 direct UK manufacturing jobs and most of the 400
jobs at Leighton Buzzard indirectly linked to manufacturing, such as those
in design and production support. Worse still, the company says, 500 new
manufacturing jobs, which would be created progressively as the new plant
increased production of high-volume models, would be at risk.
Sir Neville Bowman-Shaw, chairman of Boss and co-owner with his brother Mr
Trevor Bowman-Shaw, is hoping that the appointment of Mr Michael Heseltine
as president of the Board of Trade might tilt the balance towards industry
and employment.
Meanwhile, Mr Simon Valence, senior shop steward at the GMB general union,
said the general union had invited Mr Heseltine to visit the site.
Boss manufactures at six sites in Leighton Buzzard, involving time-consuming
transfers of components which, it estimates, may cost as much as half the
profit on each lift truck.
In 1990, because of the success of the lift trucks produced in the UK and
the need for efficient volume production in highly competitive world
markets, Boss announced a plan to consolidate manufacturing operations on
one site.
The plan has received local planning permission, and includes a new 13-acre
town park outside the proposed 37,000 sq metre manufacturing site. The new
plant would encroach on the green belt by 95 metres.
After objections from Friends of the Earth and a local preservation society,
an inquiry called by the Department of the Environment found that Boss had
not searched hard enough for an alternative site.
Boss was given until yesterday to submit a new review of alternatives, but
the review still concludes that no alternative is available that fits
management and financial criteria. A final decision from the department is
not expected until the autumn.
The Leighton Buzzard factories lost Pounds 2.75m last year, and the company
wants to resolve its future quickly - both to avoid being caught out again
by lack of capacity when market conditions improve, and to respond to the
present shake-out in the lift-truck industry.

FT  17 JUN 92 / Jubilee Line rescue ruled out
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PLANS to extend London Underground's Jubilee Line to the London Docklands
redevelopment zone appeared to be on the brink of collapse last night.
Mr John MacGregor, transport secretary, emphatically ruled out the
possibility of government intervention to save the line.
He made clear that he was not prepared to let London Underground start work
on the Pounds 1.7bn extension unless the private sector contributed the
money originally promised by Olympia &amp; York, the developer of Canary Wharf,
now in administrative receivership.
Mr MacGregor said: 'As I have made clear, we need Pounds 100m in cash during
the construction period. That is what was promised, and no public funds are
available in replacement.
'Similarly, after construction is completed, we must look for developer
contributions with a net present value equivalent to that of the stream of
post-construction payments originally promised by O&amp;Y. All contributions
must, of course, be assured before construction starts.'
Mr MacGregor made his position clear in a reply to the Federation of Civil
Engineering Contractors, which had urged him to consider rescheduling the
private-sector contribution so that work on the project could start.
Olympia &amp; York had agreed to pay Pounds 40m towards the line's construction
by March 31 this year and another Pounds 60m by March 31 next year.
It had also promised a further Pounds 300m, but that money was to be paid in
stages over 25 years from the end of the construction period, so its net
present value was only about Pounds 56m.
Work on the line is due to start now, and completion is due in 1996. Mr
MacGregor's statement appears to allow for payment of the initial Pounds
100m to slip by up to three years, because it would still fall within the
construction period.
There are still no indications, however, that any possible buyer of Canary
Wharf would be ready to assume Olympia &amp; York's commitments to the Jubilee
Line extension.
Meanwhile, London Underground has said it will disband its Jubilee Line
project team if work has not started by the end of the month.

FT  17 JUN 92 / Church withholds Pounds 1m aid for cities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE, Social Affairs Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CHURCH Commissioners have been forced by recessionary pressures to
withhold a Pounds 1m grant that was to have been made to the Church of
England's inner-cities charity, and to tell churchgoers they must contribute
more to clergy stipends.
The commissioners, who handle the church's main investments, saw investment
income grow by only 1 per cent to Pounds 167m last year. They expect little
further growth in the near future, while costs are predicted to rise
substantially, and speak in their annual report yesterday of a 'period of
sharp adjustment' ahead.
The charity, the Church Urban Fund, was set up in 1988 as a main
recommendation of Faith in the City, the church's report on urban troubles.
Its initial target was to raise Pounds 18m from churchgoers in the dioceses
and Pounds 5m from industry, with the commissioners contributing a regular
Pounds 1m a year.
Successful early fund-raising has made the fund one of Britain's 50 largest
charities, but the commissioners say they were unable to give their Pounds
1m grant last year 'in the light of the difficult economic outlook'.
The announcement of the decision comes a week after a lecture in which the
archbishop of Canterbury, Dr George Carey, spoke of the importance of
charities in a 'society suffering from shallow materialism and spiritual
bewilderment'.
Financial pressures, the commissioners say, mean they will have to cut the
proportion of clergy stipends they fund in future. Providing pensions for
the clergy and contributing to their pay consumes 85 per cent of the
commissioners' investment income.
Last year's Church of England pay bill was Pounds 145m, of which the
commissioners met 45 per cent.
A typical church member currently contributes about Pounds 3 a week.

FT  17 JUN 92 / NHS accused of race discrimination
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE NATIONAL Health Service has been accused by the Commission for Racial
Equality of discriminating against ethnic-minority nurses by putting them on
lower pay grades than other NHS workers.
At the same time, the CRE has announced it is to investigate whether
ethnic-minority doctors get the same opportunities when they apply for top
NHS jobs as their white colleagues.
A shake-up of pay for all nurses, midwives and health visitors with clinical
responsibilities took place in 1988.
All jobs were evaluated and new grades were drawn up. More than 137,000
nurses - a quarter of the workforce - have lodged appeals against the grades
awarded to them.
When the regrading exercise was launched, no one in the health service
considered the possibility of racial discrimination and no attempt was made
to monitor by ethnic origin, the results of regrading the CRE said. Yet the
nature of the regrading meant that 'there was ample opportunity for local
managers to treat staff unfavourably on racial grounds'. Those in nurse
management were relatively inexperienced in their personnel functions and
key staff were given very little training in job evaluation, the CRE found.
It reports union allegations that many nursing auxiliaries and enrolled
nurses - among whom ethnic minorities are disproportionately represented -
were automatically placed in the lowest grades, without any attempt to
assess the work they were doing.
The CRE said it was impossible to gauge how many nurses had suffered
discrimination during the regrading - 20 race complaints had been registered
with industrial tribunals - but that was likely to be only the surface of
the problem, it said.
On top jobs for doctors, the commission said there had been several
successful complaints by ethnic minority doctors to industrial tribunals.
The Health Department was unable to comment.

FT  17 JUN 92 / Guinness judge offers trials plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND HUGHES, Law Courts Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GUINNESS trial judge who called for a solution to long fraud trials has
produced his own radical and controversial proposals.
Speaking publicly last night for the first time since the trial of former
merchant bankers Mr Roger Seelig and Lord Spens was stopped in February, Mr
Justice Henry said parliament should oblige defendants to detail their
defences before the trial.
He argued that the judge and not the prosecutor should make the opening
statement in a trial, giving the jury an impartial indication of the various
issues involved.
A defendant would be more ready to give advance details of his defence if he
knew that his side of the story would be indicated to the jury at the outset
of the proceedings.
Parliament might need to impose time limits on jury trials. Save in
exceptional cases, four months should be long enough, Mr Justice Henry said.
He also argued in favour of keeping juries in serious fraud trials.
Giving the Child &amp; Co Lecture at the Council of Legal Education, the judge
said: 'The competence of the criminal law to deal with serious fraud is
clearly crucial today when the power-driven, greed-fed, dishonest excesses
of the 1980s have not proved to be the end of an unfortunate era but an
introduction to worse since.
'We have to be able to deal with serious fraud: to deter it, to detect it,
and to punish it.
'We must do this to protect the creditors, employees, and shareholders of
limited liability companies.
'We must do this to protect the public, whose pensions and insurances depend
on it. We must do this to protect the integrity of the market.'
Serious fraud trials took too long, were insufficiently focused on the real
issues, cost too much and placed too great a strain on those involved, he
said.
Advocating the retention of juries, he said the great majority of judges who
had tried long fraud cases had come through confident in their jury and in
the verdicts they would give.
Equal justice in cases of white-collar crime as in blue-collar crime was one
reason for keeping the jury, he said.
Juries needed more help, though. 'It seems to me there is a case for the
trial judge opening both the law and the issues to the jury. This would
require him to summarise each defendant's case.'
He would also like to be able to give the jury his own running summaries of
the evidence on each issue.

FT  17 JUN 92 / File on Legion cash loss sent to Crown
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A DOSSIER outlining how the Royal British Legion lost nearly Pounds 900,000
of public money has been sent to the attorney-general.
The Charity Commissioners' report follows an inquiry into the collapse of a
housing association run by the legion.
The report, sent to the attorney-general for information, severely
criticised the way the housing association charity was run and delivered a
'severe public rebuke' to officials in office at the time.
The legion's national executive council and the finance and general purposes
committee authorised Pounds 2.35m to be lent to the housing association, in
breach of trust laws.
Commissioners claim that the charity was negligent and 'out of its depth' in
the course of its dealings with the property market.
Mr Ian Davies, the investigator, said it was 'particularly disturbing' to
find the legion took no professional advice before making the original loan
of Pounds 1.5m.
Early warnings that all was not well were given in 1987, yet trustees failed
to act on the warnings and get the situation under control, the report said.
Two years later difficulties with loans increased, yet 'trustees did not
appear to take any notice of this matter, nor institute any inquiry as to
what was going wrong and whether they should be taking any further action'.
Even when the trustees had realised that they were out of their depth they
had failed to act quickly to stem their losses, the report said.
The 95-page report, the result of a two-year investigation into the loss,
said some of the money which was involved was paid back, but almost Pounds
900,000 had been lost.
It claimed that the 'fragmented management structure' of the British Legion
contributed to the development of the issue. However, it noted, a
'thoroughgoing review' of the charity's internal structure was now taking
place.

FT  17 JUN 92 / Economists fear record PSBR total
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PUBLIC-SECTOR finances deteriorated by less than expected last month, but
economists warned that Britain was still heading for a record deficit this
financial year.
The public-sector borrowing requirement in May was Pounds 3.1bn, including
privatisation proceeds of Pounds 0.8bn. That brought the cumulative PSBR
total since April - the beginning of the financial year - to Pounds 6.6bn,
compared with Pounds 5.6bn in the same period last year.
Mr James Barty, UK economist at investment bank Morgan Grenfell, said: 'The
two monthly figures we have had so far are on the whole consistent with a
PSBR of around Pounds 32bn.'
In the March Budget Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, forecast a PSBR of
Pounds 28bn, double the size of the previous year's deficit. With any
economic upturn this year likely to be weak, the Treasury's figure is likely
to be exceeded as tax receipts fail to live up to expectations and high
unemployment keeps government spending high.
Total cash receipts in May were Pounds 15.2bn and Pounds 32.1bn for the
first two months of 1992-93, 2 per cent lower than the Pounds 32.8bn of
receipts in the first two months of the previous financial year. Inland
Revenue receipts in April and May were 4.5 per cent lower than a year
earlier at Pounds 11.4bn.
The Treasury said income tax collected to date this year had been boosted by
the payment of bonuses before the general election to avoid planned tax
increases by a Labour government.
According to Mr Michael Saunders, UK economist at investment bank Salomon
Brothers, the month's figures were also cushioned by prompt receipt of poll
tax payments.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A LOOPHOLE in the law on computer fraud was closed by the Court of Appeal
yesterday.
Lord Taylor, the Lord Chief Justice, sitting with Mr Justice Macpherson and
Mr Justice Turner, overturned a judge's ruling last year that interfering
with a computer by operating the keyboard directly could not count as
computer fraud, because the Computer Misuse Act was directed at 'hacking' -
breaking into a computer network using another computer.
Lord Taylor said that if a person who gained direct access to computer data
could not be convicted, it would lead to a 'surprising and unlikely' gap in
the act.
The case arose out of the acquittal of a man accused of computer fraud at
Snaresbrook Crown Court last year. Purchasing key-cutting equipment from a
former employer, he awarded himself a 70 per cent discount by keying in the
necessary instructions on a sales assistant's computer. The man's acquittal
stands.

FT  17 JUN 92 / Botnar's business 'lacked rules'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NISSAN UK, the former importer-distributor of Nissan vehicles controlled by
Mr Octav Botnar, was run in 'an unconventional and extraordinary way', the
High Court was told yesterday.
Mr Anthony Boswood QC, counsel for Nissan UK, said 'there was a complete
lack of 'proper' formalities, rules, procedures and lines of reporting such
as one would expect to find in a business of such size and importance.'
Mr Boswood was summing up for Nissan UK, which is being sued for more than
Pounds 1m in damages by Mr Stan Cholaj, a former assistant managing director
of the company who is claiming wrongful dismissal and breach of contract.
Mr Boswood said that Mr Botnar controlled the company in an autocratic way.
'Mr Botnar treated this company as his own personal thing or fiefdom,' he
said.
The hearing continues today.

FT  17 JUN 92 / Conflict between roles and masters led to confusion
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES LEADBEATER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   EARLY in 1972, some of the most powerful men in Britain
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
trade union leaders, civil servants, businessmen and politicians - met
regularly amid great secrecy to plot the nation's economic future.
They drew up secret national economic plans that paved the way for the
voluntary incomes policy that the Heath government introduced in late 1972.
They met at the offices of the National Economic Development Office. A
former senior Nedo economist who sat in on the sessions recalls: 'We tried
to agree on the rate of profit which would be required to finance the
investment needed to increase productivity by enough to finance the unions'
real wage claims.'
It was the closest Nedo got to combining its many roles into real power. It
was also indicative of one of the weaknesses that has dogged Nedo from its
birth in early 1962 to yesterday's announcement that it is to be disbanded:
the confusion between its different roles and masters.
Nedo was created by Mr Harold Macmillan's Tory government in 1962 as an
attempt to mimic the apparent success of indicative planning in the post-war
rebuilding of French industry.
The unemployment of the 1930s had persuaded him that co-operation between
government, industry and unions was essential for economic growth. Nedo was
intended to create that co-operation.
Harold Wilson's Department of Economic Affairs, which was responsible for
economic planning and was intended as a counterweight to the Treasury, was
substantially staffed by Nedo officials. After Labour's brief but
unsuccessful experiment with planning in the mid 1960s, Nedo became a feeble
instrument of incomes policy and industrial strategy in the 1970s. In the
1980s it withered under the ideological onslaught of the Thatcher
government's attack on the corporate state.
Nedo's performance has to be assessed against its various roles.
Planning: Nedo was established when French planning was already becoming
less effective and it lacked many of the tools that French experience
suggested were needed for planning. Nedo was discredited by the failure of
Labour's national economic plan in the mid 1960s.
Economic policy: After the voluntary incomes policy of 1972, Nedo was a
largely ineffective forum for agreeing and policing incomes policy deals. In
the 1980s, the unions lost much of their power, companies decentralised
bargaining and the growth of the service sector made national industrial
bargaining less relevant.
Industrial strategy: The Labour industrial strategy between 1976 and 1979
gave Nedo new life, exploring the supply side of the economy and British
industrial competitiveness. Former Nedo officials say much of the work was
overblown special pleading by sectional interests. But many of the so-called
'little Neddies', which will be retained under the DTI's umbrella, did
useful work on grassroots issues of competitiveness.
Information: Nedo's most consistently useful role has been as an independent
assessor of the health of the British economy. Its highly influential report
on value added tax in 1965 was followed by extensive and critical reports on
the nationalised industries in the 1970s and the parlous state of training
in the 1980s.
On balance, Nedo was not a success across its 30-year life. It did not
succeed in its original aim of being the mechanism for public policy to
improve industrial competitiveness. It was better at small things - economic
reports and sectoral initiatives - than big things - planning and promoting
social co-operation.
Its weaknesses were a reflection of the institutions that were its parents.
The leadership of the TUC and the CBI could not persuade their members to
abide by agreements made at Nedo.
Most important, the central state was unwilling to devolve any of its power
over economic policy to an independent body. Nedo was always overshadowed by
the Treasury.
It was never a fully accepted part of the machinery of the state nor fully
outside it. It was deprived of influence over policy making on the inside
but never had the political independence it needed to produce radical ideas.
A former Nedo chief economist recalls his work: 'We spent a lot of time
inspecting a huge setting sun. We were dealing with an industrial decline
which was so deep-seated that we could do very little to arrest it. We
produced a lot of useful diagnoses of the problems, but we were not able to
do anything about them. We had no agenda to change British society.'

FT  17 JUN 92 / Compromise avoids clash in the cabinet: Nedo failed to meet
original aims; 'Industrial vandalism' says Smith; Heseltine ready to
reorganise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT HAD all the hallmarks of a classic Majorite compromise. Depending on
which camp you asked yesterday, the abolition of the National Economic
Development Council represented a victory for Mr Norman Lamont's economic
liberalism or the foundation stone for Mr Michael Heseltine's promised
industrial activism.
In political terms it was a neat way of defusing a potential clash between
two of the most powerful figures in the cabinet over how the government
should conduct its dialogue with industry.
Mr Lamont, who has long been sceptical about the highly publicised and
politicised setpiece discussions in the NEDC on broad economic strategy,
could justly claim that he had abolished the last vestiges of 1960s
corporatism.
It was the chancellor who instituted the post-election review of the
council's future, in effect pre-empting any move by Mr Heseltine to increase
his influence over its deliberations.
Mr Heseltine has long advocated that sponsorship of the NEDC should move to
the department he took over after the general election. He has also made
clear that the Department of Trade and Industry will adopt a much higher
profile in championing the cause of British industry.
Mr Lamont was determined from the outset of the review that the council
should be scrapped - underlining his view that macro-economic policy, and
above all the priority given to the defeat of inflation, could no longer be
regarded as a legitimate subject for tripartite debate.
But the Labour spokesmen who claimed yesterday that Mr Heseltine had been
outflanked by the Treasury were only half right. With Mr Major brokering the
negotiations, the great survivor of British politics made sure that the deal
included an enhanced role for the DTI in overseeing the government's
contacts with industry.
In a remark that reflected the obvious tensions between the two figures, Mr
Lamont yesterday emphasised that only a few officials from the National
Economic Development Office would be switched to the DTI. Nor could Mr
Heseltine expect extra money.
That will not stop the president of the Board of Trade from attempting to
recreate within the DTI the intensive contacts between government and
industry that were provided by Nedo's sectoral working parties.
Mr Heseltine has already said he will reorganise the DTI's industrial
divisions along sectoral lines. Under plans he intends to announce next
month, more of the department's efforts will be directed towards identifying
areas where the government can help specific industries.
Mr Heseltine is particularly keen to find out where British companies are
weak in competing with overseas rivals so that export assistance can be more
closely targeted.
The Treasury, ever suspicious of such policies, will no longer be able to
claim that such a strategy would be an unnecessary duplication of the work
done by NEDC's working parties.
More broadly, Mr Heseltine is pushing ahead with a strategy designed to give
the DTI a much stronger role in co-ordinating across Whitehall policies that
affect industry and trade.
He is not interested in the classic interventionism of the 1960s and 1970s
but he does believe that he can establish himself as industry's champion in
the government.
There are clear limits to his ambitions - not least the prospect of a tough
public spending round in the autumn and the instinctive suspicions of many
in the Conservative party about his activist instincts.
Some of his friends, though, were feeling confident enough yesterday to
remind journalists of the title of the book in which he first advocated a
more prominent role for Nedo - Where There's a Will.

FT  17 JUN 92 / Business chiefs shed few tears over abolition
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER, ANDREW TAYLOR and DIANE SUMMERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INDUSTRIAL organisations shed few tears yesterday at the passing of the
NEDC, while the reaction from union leaders was generally angry.
The response from the Engineering Employers Federation captured the mood of
industry. 'This opens the way for an industry-government dialogue on an
informal and less rigidly structured basis,' Mr Neil Johnson,
director-general, said.
Sir John Banham, director-general of the Confederation of British Industry,
said abolition was 'precisely in line' with the CBI's Business Agenda for
the 1990s, published last year. 'For many years the NEDC has appeared to be
an anachronism that was left over from the corporate state era - thankfully
now in the past.'
The CBI was pleased that 'any useful work' done by the NEDC's sector working
groups - 'little Neddies' - would continue under the Department of Trade and
Industry.
The Institute of Directors warmly welcomed the abolition of what Dr Ann
Robinson, head of the IoD policy unit, called 'a hangover from the days of
the corporatist, collectivist system. It was the creation of politicians and
special interest groups who thought they knew better than individuals
expressing their preferences through the market.'
A note of caution was sounded by Mr Ian Deslandes, acting director-general
of the Building Employers Confederation.
'Nedo has provided an important forum for discussion for the industry as
well as producing some valuable studies to improve standards and efficiency
within the industry,' he said. 'We are naturally concerned to see what plans
the government has to replace these functions.'
The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders said it was crucial that
industry should be able to meet regularly and discuss issues with the
government.
Mr Norman Willis, Trades Union Congress general secretary, said there had
'never been a greater need for government, employers and unions to work
together to solve both the short-term and long-term problems of the British
economy'.
Mr John Edmonds, general secretary of the GMB general union, said: 'This is
amazing. We are in the depths of recession and the government is going to
scrap the one body where government, business and unions can sit down
together and listen to each other.'

FT  17 JUN 92 / Insurers warned over laws
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE INSURANCE industry came under fire yesterday from one of its strongest
supporters.
Mr David McIntosh, senior partner with Davies Arnold Cooper, the City firm
of solicitors that represents a number of leading insurers, says that the
industry must do more to influence the shape of future UK and European
legislation, which may leave it with growing future liabilities.
DAC says the combination of the legislative changes, an increasing tendency
towards litigation in personal injury and other cases and the 'stridency' of
the consumerist lobby is presenting business as a whole with big new
challenges.
The industry should neither oppose that trend outright nor remain passive,
but campaign for practical improvements in order to 'prevent single-issue
activists grabbing the moral high ground'.
Mr McIntosh said: 'The insurance industry has been too reactive for years
and years. The industry has to try and influence the scene ahead of
litigation coming.'
Mr McIntosh praised some recent initiatives such as the establishment of the
Arson Prevention Bureau, which co-ordinates an industry-wide response to
arson losses.
Nevertheless, further action should be taken to increase the power of the
industry's lobbying.
Insurers should campaign for improvements in the conduct of civil litigation
where their interest was affected by, for example, pressing for changes in
the way personal injury damages were assessed.
Insurers should also show greater willingness to pool information and
statistics.

FT  17 JUN 92 / US Names continue action
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEW YORK lawyers acting for dissident US Names intend to appeal against a US
court decision dismissing part of their action against Lloyd's of London.
The case is the biggest of a series of actions brought by US Names who are
alleging that Lloyd's, the insurance market, breached US securities laws
when they were recruited.
On Monday, Judge Maurice Lasker dismissed proceedings brought by 91 Names
against 319 Lloyd's syndicates.
The US district court judge ruled that the action could not be brought
against the syndicates because they had no legal existence under English
law.
Syndicates are annual joint ventures, formed by Names, the individuals whose
capital supports underwriting on the Lloyd's market.
Ms Minna Schrag, of Prokauer Rose Goetz Mendelsohn, said the Names would
appeal. Action against three other classes of defendants - managing
agencies, members' agencies and Lloyd's itself - would continue.
Each defendant has filed separate motions to dismiss the action.
Although they are on a variety of legal grounds, all the defendants argue
that, under the member's contractual agreement with the agent, disputes
arising from membership should be heard under English law in an English
court.

FT  17 JUN 92 / Government 'shooting the messenger'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ABOLITION of Nedo was greeted with hostility by Labour and ambivalence
by some Tory backbenchers in the Commons yesterday.
Mr John Smith, shadow chancellor, described it as 'an act of industrial
vandalism' and asked whether Nedo was paying the price for 'telling the
truth' about the UK economy.
After ignoring the message, the government 'shoots the messenger', he said.
Its reaction to criticism, however constructive, was that the critics were
to be eliminated.
The favourite for the Labour leadership cited the book written in 1987 by Mr
Michael Heseltine, now president of the Board of Trade and present in the
chamber, which commented favourably on Nedo's potential while suggesting
that the trade secretary rather than the chancellor should take the chair.
'Just as Mr Heseltine was about to claim the seat, the chancellor has
whipped the chair away,' Mr Smith concluded.
Mr Edward Heath, former Tory prime minister and father of the House,
suggested that the decision might strengthen Mr Heseltine's hand.
He said the 'vital discussions between all parts of industry for the future
of this country' would be undertaken by the trade and industry secretary. He
welcomed the move because it got the Treasury 'out of the way'. He added:
'In all my experience of Nedo, the Treasury was a pain in the neck.'
Mr Alan Williams, former Labour industry minister, branded the announcement
'a smokescreen' to divert attention from the government's U-turn of
advocating a non-interventionist role for the DTI.
Mr John Wilkinson, Conservative MP for Ruislip Northwood, urged
reconstitution of the trade and industry select committee. Industrial
experience in the Commons was 'gravely deficient', not least in government,
he said.
Mr Nicholas Winterton, Tory MP for Macclesfield, asked whether there would
be a forum for manufacturing industry.
Mr John Spellar, Tory MP for Warley West, described Nedo as a forum where
effective dialogue did take place.
But Mr Dennis Skinner, Labour MP for Bolsover, said he could not join Mr
Smith in shedding a tear for Nedo. It was time trade union leaders got back
to their real jobs, rather than 'mixing with bosses and supping claret'.

FT  17 JUN 92 / Car chiefs reject plea for price cuts
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE IS no scope for any general reduction in the price of British cars,
leading figures in the motor industry told Mr Michael Heseltine, president
of the Board of Trade, yesterday.
They said there was no 'pot of gold' in their pockets and the public was
being misled into believing car prices in Britain were unjustifiably high.
Mr Heseltine met Mr Ian McAllister, chairman of Ford of Britain; Mr William
Ebbert, chairman of Vauxhall; Mr Geoffrey Whalen, managing director of
Peugeot Talbot; Mr Colin Hope, chairman and chief executive of T&amp;N and
president of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, and Sir Hal
Miller, SMMT chief executive, for 45 minutes.
The meeting was held against the background of a recent European Commission
report identifying differentials of more than 40 per cent in the prices of
some car models across Community markets.
Sir Leon Brittan, EC competition commissioner, has called on carmakers to
improve price transparency and reduce differentials.
Sir Hal said after yesterday's meeting that he and his colleagues had told
Mr Heseltine that no further investigation into prices could be justified.
A recent two-year investigation by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission
largely cleared the British motor industry of anti-competitive practices.
Sir Hal said: 'There is a whole lot of nonsense being talked about car
prices, as if there were a pot of gold at the end of the rainbow and at the
wave of a magic wand prices can come down. The general public has been
misled into expecting somehow that car prices will be reduced.'
The UK motor industry leaders voiced their concern that the government might
unilaterally lift restraints on Japanese car exports to Britain.
The SMMT said that 'would run the risk of disturbing the already fragile
agreement between the EC and Japan and could encourage other EC member
states to block the free circulation within the common market of cars made
in Britain by British workers at Britain's Japanese factories'.

A BREAKTHROUGH in the eight-year dispute between the government and unions
over union membership restrictions at the Government Communications

The TUC said the government had responded to pressure from the International
Labour Organisation and was reopening talks with Civil Service unions.
The ILO has been critical of the ban on membership of national unions at
GCHQ.
The government has argued since 1984 that membership of a national union is
incompatible with security.
However, the Department of Employment denied a change in the government's
stance.

A NORTH sea oil worker sacked for striking was unfairly dismissed, an
industrial tribunal has ruled, Catherine Milton writes.
The tribunal, in Aberdeen, found that Mr James Byrne had been unfairly
dismissed because he lost his job for taking unofficial strike action in
1990 while Mr John Goddard, described as an 'agent provocateur', had been
kept on even though he had taken part in the action.
Lawyers for Wood Group Engineering, the employer, argued that Mr Byrne was
dismissed for disobeying lawful instructions to leave the oil rig, the site
of a sit-in, whereas Mr Goddard had returned to shore. Yesterday the company
said it was studying the result.
Mr Byrne was one of more than 700 oil workers dismissed after unofficial
strike action over recognition in 1990.

advisers overlooked or failed to recognise the signs of risk. Then, as the
crisis deepened, all the possible lines of defence failed - regulators,
auditors and stockbrokers - and Maxwell began raiding the pension funds
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TO THE END Robert Maxwell kept up the pretence that he was honest, that his
empire was flourishing, and that his critics were malicious or wrong.
September 11 1991, seven weeks before his death, was his last ever
performance at Maxwell Communication Corporation's annual meeting. Maxwell
wore his favourite 'sorcerer's' tie: bright blue, with yellow and red stars,
lightning bolts ricocheting across it. In its centre was a large greenish
food stain; the three secretaries at his side either had not noticed, or did
not dare tell him.
'I hope to stay chairman permanently, but at the age of 68 I can give no
assurances,' Maxwell said with a touch of humour. The acknowledgement of his
mortality was almost the only true thing he uttered in the following
presentation.
Behind Maxwell's imperturbable expression, his empire was in crisis and he
was already deep into one of the biggest business frauds of the century.
Even so, two weeks later, on September 22, he wrote a blistering tirade in
the Sunday Mirror saying that he treated pensioners from Mirror Group
Newspapers better than other employers would have treated them.
In fact, Maxwell siphoned away Pounds 933m - most of it in 1991 - from his
two public companies Maxwell Communication Corporation (MCC) and Mirror
Group Newspapers (MGN) and from their pension funds.
In many ways, Maxwell's fraud was breathtakingly simple. On July 4 1991, for
example, four months and one day before his death, the late publisher sat at
his desk in his 60-foot long office at Maxwell House and signed over Pounds
75m of his pensioners' money to himself.
The contract, drawn up under Maxwell's instructions, was for the sale of
shares in Scitex, a high-flying Israeli printing company and one of the most
successful investments he made.
On one side of the contract was Bishopsgate Investment Management, the
private Maxwell company which managed most of the Pounds 700m in the pension
funds of the public Maxwell companies on behalf of 30,000 past and present
pensioners. BIM owned the Scitex shares.
On the other side was Robert Maxwell Group, the company at the heart of
Maxwell's secretive business labyrinth, whose ultimate owners lay in the
tax-havens of Gibraltar and Liechtenstein.
Maxwell signed the contract as chairman of BIM. He then signed it again as
chairman of Robert Maxwell Group: the pension funds would hand over their
shares in Scitex to Robert Maxwell Group to sell in the stock market on the
pension funds' behalf. Robert Maxwell Group would repay the pension funds.
That is what was supposed to happen. Robert Maxwell Group duly sold the
shares on October 9 at an enormous profit. But, instead of giving the money
back to the pension funds as agreed under the contract, Robert Maxwell Group
gave the money to its banks to pay off debts.
Maxwell's action was not illegal at the time. However, when, on his death,
his bankrupt companies could not repay the pension funds, the Scitex loss
proved to be the single biggest hole blasted in the pension funds.
The Scitex scandal is typical of the Maxwell fraud. It was very fast, and
very easy. It is typical in one other respect as well: the pensioners' money
eventually found its way to Maxwell's banks, to pay down years of
accumulated debt in his labyrinth of private companies.
It is clear now that signs of trouble in Maxwell's empire were visible from
1989 onwards. But they were either overlooked by Maxwell's lenders and
advisers or their seriousness was not recognised.
All the lines of defence failed: Imro, the pension management watchdog; the
auditors; merchant bank advisers; stockbrokers.
There are two main questions about the fraud: how was Maxwell able to steal
more than Pounds 900m in just over nine months and could it have been
stopped or detected earlier?
Some of the answers are complex - Maxwell set up his empire's tortuous
finances to confuse observers and enable him to subvert the rules. But they
are also simple. Neil Cooper - of Robson Rhodes, the firm of accountants
appointed provisional liquidator to the pension funds - says of the Scitex
loss: 'It is difficult to put a more charitable interpretation on it -
Maxwell just took the money.'
Only a tiny core of Maxwell's executives had responsibilities that straddled
both sides of the empire. Robert Maxwell and his sons Kevin and Ian were
directors of all four parts of the group - although Kevin gave up his MGN
position after its flotation in spring 1991. Beyond that inner circle
Michael Stoney and Ron Woods had both public and private Maxwell
directorships.
Maxwell was able to seize money so quickly because the sweeping powers he
had secured as chairman of his companies allowed him to move money between
them with little reference to anyone else. His policy of divide and rule
concealed what he was doing from many.
The fraud sucked Pounds 933m from three parts of the Maxwell empire - the
two public companies and the pension funds - to feed the fourth, the
'private side,' as Maxwell called it, which was tottering under years of
accumulated losses and debt.
This private side was a tangled web of 400 secretive investment companies.
It included some of Maxwell's most disastrous gambles: The European
newspaper; the New York Daily News, the troubled US newspaper he had rescued
in March 1991; Berliner Verlag, his attempt to start a Berlin newspaper; and
AGB, the loss-making market research company.
Maxwell's death on November 5 exposed the fact that the private side had
drained Pounds 448m from the pension funds' total assets of Pounds 676m. It
had left behind only those assets that were hard to sell quickly - like a
burglar taking the silver but leaving the dining room table.
From MCC - Maxwell's largest public company, valued at around Pounds 1bn on
the stock market when he died - the private side had taken Pounds 388m cash
and assets.
From MGN - the second public company, valued at around Pounds 400m - the
private companies had taken Pounds 97m cash.
Maxwell had amassed enormous powers. He had the right to sign cash out of
MCC's bank accounts or sign away its assets on his signature alone, although
two signatures were needed for MGN deals.
In 1989, crucially, he was allowed to create the mechanism that let him raid
the pension funds. First, he pooled the Pounds 700m invested by the separate
pension funds of all his companies. Then he created a company, with himself
as chairman, to manage most of that pot: Bishopsgate Investment Management.
All but one of its directors were also directors of his own private
companies, including himself, Kevin and Ian - a situation as far removed
from the 'arm's length' model envisaged by regulators for company pension
schemes as can be imagined.
BIM took control of pension investment policy from the trustees of the
individual pension funds who could no longer see what was happening. BIM
also took physical control of many of the actual share certificates.
With hindsight, the licensing of BIM by Imro in 1989, under the Financial
Services Act 1986, was a vital step in allowing Maxwell access to pension
money. Although it had never come across a model resembling BIM, Imro still
licensed it under its rules for Occupational Pension Schemes, which do not
have to submit audited financial accounts for inspection. Imro then visited
BIM only once, and did not examine it closely.
Two groups had extensive access to the empire as a whole: the larger banks -
particularly the UK clearing banks whose loans stretched throughout the
empire - and Maxwell's auditors Coopers &amp; Lybrand Deloitte.
The banks lent the empire more than Pounds 3bn at its peak, in retrospect
too great a burden. As their worries mounted they pressed for repayment or
greater security and received more than Pounds 1bn in 1991. Most of it was
siphoned from pension funds and the public companies.
In some cases, the ownership of those assets is now disputed. That claim is
likely to be argued out in the courts. What does appear to be the case is
that some of the banks did not probe the source of the cash too closely.
In their defence the banks can claim they received poor information. Some
say they were given out-of-date figures on AGB and The European which hid
the size of their losses.
It is also clear, however, that some banks dropped their usually rigorous
standards in lending to the Maxwell empire. Maxwell raised the private
side's loans of some Pounds 1.5bn from 80 different banks. As the loans were
often just for a few months, and were usually backed by assets - property
and shares - many of the smaller lenders did not bother to assess the state
of the whole empire.
They were also complacent. One clearing bank director says in retrospect:
'We did not normally have these (low) standards - even for a very
well-managed company among the top 200 on the stock market we would normally
ask for more information.'
The same director explains: 'For 30 years he had done business in this way -
it was unsatisfactory but he had always come up with the goods.'
At the time of Maxwell's death NatWest was the largest lender to his private
companies. It had taken more care than many to notice what was going on,
however, and judged - rightly - that the situation was becoming unacceptably
risky.
Over the preceding two years the bank had halved its total loans to his
empire to Pounds 182m - almost all of that to the private side.
One executive from NatWest says: 'We said: 'He's a touch overweight and
ageing,' Then there was the bewildering speed and variety of the deals and
we said maybe the top was spinning a bit too quickly.'
Other banks had part of their loans paid off after the flotation of MGN on
the stock market. One bank whose loans were partly repaid during 1991
comments in retrospect that the banks' demands for repayment could have had
a de-stabilising effect on the group: 'The pressure we were putting on the
companies - if you deprive anyone of that amount of cash it's equivalent to
decapitalising a business.'
Several banks became aware that the creditworthiness of the private side was
deteriorating in May after the MGN flotation. Their response was to press
for more assets - property and shares - to back their loans.
MGN, until it was separated by flotation, had been the private side's cash
dispenser. But when it became a public company, obliged to pay dividends to
shareholders, it was no longer able to donate its profits to Maxwell's
private companies.
'The picture began to change so fast that we would need new projections of
where the cash was coming from nearly every fortnight,' says a director of
one UK clearing bank.
The director and his assistant went to ask Kevin Maxwell, just days after
the flotation, where the private side would now get cash to pay its bills.
Kevin's answer - hardly reassuring - was 'arguably, it would have been
better not to have floated MGN'. The banker says: 'I just gulped, but was
reassured that asset sales would bring down debt.'
In many cases banks did not inquire closely enough where the comforting
packages of cash or assets came from. Increasingly during 1991 the answer
was the pension funds.
Of the Pounds 448m eventually missing from the pension funds, Pounds 248m of
shares had been liquidated and the cash given to banks. The destination of
the Scitex proceeds is just one example of this.
The other Pounds 200m lost from the pension funds occured when share
certificates were simply handed over to banks as backing for loans. Robson
Rhodes argues that banks should have known they were being given pension
shares, because in most cases BIM's name was still written at the top of the
share certificates. Neil Cooper says that as BIM had no role except managing
pension funds, the banks need to answer where they thought the shares were
coming from.
As the crisis gathered speed over the summer of 1991 Maxwell squeezed some
fresh short term loans out of a few banks - from Midland Bank, Bankers
Trust, and the Bank of Nova Scotia - but the money was drying up fast. 'By
September we were desperate,' one clearing bank director says. 'We could see
there was just no cashflow at all on the private side.'
During this accelerating panic, the banks did not confer with each other.
John Melbourn, NatWest's chief executive in charge of group credit risk,
explains: 'Not only is it against the rules of client confidentiality to
talk to other banks, we wouldn't talk to them in circumstances where we
think we have to make sure to protect our own security.'
Maxwell thus evaded the scrutiny of the banks. An important potential line
of defence failed. The next possible tripwire - the auditing of the books -
also failed to rescue the situation.
Coopers &amp; Lybrand Deloitte - as auditors to all the Maxwell companies, apart
from the Gibraltar and Liechtenstein trusts - had access to all parts of the
empire for audit purposes. Coopers were not in a position to check the books
of the company on a day-to-day basis.
Coopers now says: 'Maxwell had done nothing wrong since the 1970s; from our
point of view he'd played it by the book.'
Coopers says it did not detect the pension fund fraud because the last audit
date was April 1990, and the pilfering of assets happened after that.
That April the audit had shown some small irregularities in stocklending
procedures. A subsequent audit would almost certainly have shown that the
same practices had grown in the intervening period. But the audit report was
not finalised until April 1991.
Coopers says the 12-month lag is within the Occupational Pensions Board
recommended timetable and 'pension fund accounts tend not to get priority in
things; they normally take longer than public company accounts to be
finalised'.
However, the audit for the year to April 1991 never took place. One of the
ways Maxwell avoided detection was by the simple device of extending the
audit period. He simply declared that the next one would be December 1991, a
gap of 21 months.
Why did Coopers agree - and why did it not insist on interim accounts?
Coopers says that it is for the directors and trustees, not the auditors, to
determine the audit date. But it adds that it did press for interim accounts
in July 1991 and said - in a letter to Trevor Cook, the pension manager,
dated August 9 - that 21 months was too long a gap.
Coopers adds: 'Kevin was also a director of BIM and took some responsibility
for pension affairs.' In Coopers' view Kevin 'had accepted the need for
interim accounts', although no steps had been taken to prepare them by
November when Robert Maxwell died.
A separate team of auditors from Coopers was responsible for the books of
Robert Maxwell Group, which acted as group banker for much of the Maxwell
empire, funnelling money in and out of all the companies, including many of
the pension funds. The last audit of Robert Maxwell Group by Coopers was in
December 1990, eight months after the pension audit.
The pension liquidators now believe that, by late 1990, the pensions funds
were already lending some of their assets to Robert Maxwell Group in an
irregular manner.
Coopers say that, at the date on which Robert Maxwell Group was audited,
they 'detected no irregularities'.
A third audit team at Coopers was aware of worries at MCC in the days before
Maxwell's death. During October Neil Taberner, the Coopers partner in charge
of MCC, learned that the private companies owed around Pounds 100m to MCC.
Taberner did not communicate the information to Coopers teams looking at the
rest of the empire, nor would he have had access to their views. Coopers
operated a policy of strict separation between the four audit teams assigned
to each arm of the Maxwell empire on the grounds of client confidentiality.
Coopers now says: 'We are confident in the work we did. There is nothing we
have particular concerns about. One greatly regrets the position of the
pensioners.'
As the crisis inside the Maxwell companies grew in 1991, there were a number
of moments when outsiders caught glimpses of the problems that were to bring
the empire down. As well as using BIM to manage the pension money, Maxwell
used several respected City investment houses - such as Invesco MIM, Capel
Cure Myers, and Lloyds Bank Investment Management.
According to writs filed against MIM and Capel Cure Myers by the Mirror
Group Pension Fund - the largest of the Maxwell pension funds - the fund
managers were aware by April 1991 of worrying patterns in lending out shares
from the Maxwell funds. 'Stocklending' is a legal and common practice among
funds to boost their income, but the writs allege that the Maxwell
stocklending was irregular in many ways. Invesco MIM was worried enough, the
writs say, to hold an internal meeting to discuss the matter in April.
Samuel Montagu, the merchant bank which had advised on the MGN flotation,
was alerted to problems a month before Maxwell died.
On Thursday October 3 Ernie Burrington, MGN managing director, told Andrew
Galloway, a Samuel Montagu director, that the Maxwells had taken Pounds 47m
from the MGN bank accounts and would not give it back. Burrington said: 'I
have no evidence of anything illegal, but the lack of information is
worrying me. Would you - Samuel Montagu - ask him?'
Burrington's call to the bank followed a row he had in Maxwell's bedroom at
the Labour party conference in Brighton the day before. Maxwell had accused
the MGN directors of meeting in secret 'cabals'.
On Friday, the MGN directors had a strategy meeting at Knutfield Priory in
Surrey. Burrington accompanied Maxwell out to the helicopter waiting to take
him to London when the telephone rang to confirm Maxwell's meeting with
Samuel Montagu.
Later that day Ian McIntosh, a board director of Samuel Montagu, met Maxwell
at Maxwell House in London. Maxwell told him that some money had already
been paid back and some was going to stay in gilts - government bonds - as
an investment.
McIntosh says that Montagu then 'kept a dialogue' with the MGN directors as
they tried to track down documentation. No money was recovered, however, and
on Maxwell's death it emerged that a further Pounds 50m had gone missing.
Montagu says: 'There's nothing more we could have done to protect the
Mirror. It was a sound business. A manager's got to be allowed to manage. If
we thought Maxwell should have been locked up we would have had no business
listing the Mirror.'
Another missed opportunity came between April and July 1991, starting around
the time of the MGN flotation. Over that period orders were placed for
around Pounds 300m of MCC and MGN shares. It is now clear that this was a
huge, hidden scheme to prop up the shares of Maxwell's two public companies.
The scheme was essential to Maxwell's protracted survival. He needed to
support the share price because he had pledged his own shares in MCC and MGN
 -his controlling interest - to the banks to raise loans for the private
companies. If the value of the shares fell too far, the banks would call in
the loans and the private side would crash.
Many of the share deals were carried out through Goldman Sachs, the
blue-chip US stockbroker. Goldman Sachs was told by Maxwell that the
Liechtenstein and Swiss trusts buying the shares were entirely independent
of him. Goldman Sachs says it acted properly.
When the empire finally collapsed Maxwell's private companies had taken so
much money from the rest of the empire that the pension funds were unable to
keep up payments to the pensioners and MCC was pushed into administration
under insolvency laws, to be dissected and sold in pieces. MGN is the only
part that remains alive, although weakened.
At the Sunday night meeting of the banks and accountants on December 3 when
the scale of the fraud was exposed for the first time an 'audible gasp' went
round the table. Several bank directors left early telling the others that
they had lost their jobs.
Imro's own internal investigation has concluded that it should have singled
out problematic members of Imro for special attention.
But not much else has changed. Coopers is still the auditor for MGN. The
Serious Fraud Office is still investigating the support scheme, but will not
be bringing charges against Goldman Sachs. If there is any criminal trial,
Goldmans staff may well be called as witnesses for the prosecution to give
evidence against those charged.
Even as his empire was slipping from his grasp, Maxwell - who never lacked
bravado - could still take a joke against himself. In the spring of 1991 a
banker was talking on the telephone to Maxwell. 'I'm going to give up being
chairman, and just meet presidents, and live on my boat in New York,'
Maxwell told him. 'Oh look, there's a pig going past my window,' the
executive replied. 'Is it a pink one?' Maxwell boomed.

FT  17 JUN 92 / Sense of crisis still dogs Perez: Pressure on Venezuela's
government is mounting
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOSEPH MANN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MORE THAN five months after the coup attempt that came close to ousting
President Carlos Andres Perez, a sense of crisis still pervades Venezuela.
The February 4 rebellion by junior army officers released pent-up
anti-government sentiment and produced waves of angry protests against the
Perez administration. The officers said their action was intended to
eliminate an inefficient and corrupt political system, punish those who had
stolen from the state, repeal the government's three-year-old economic
reform programme and guarantee national sovereignty.
In recent weeks the country has been shaken by dozens of violent
anti-government protests staged by students in Caracas and other key cities.
The students, along with many of the president's political opponents, are
calling for the resignation of Mr Perez and an end to his economic reform
programme.
Mr Perez has been resisting the calls, repeatedly stating he will remain in
office until his term ends in February 1994.
Pressure on the government increased last week when the main opposition
group, the Christian Democrat party (Copei), withdrew two members from the
cabinet and a political independent resigned from the Ministry of Economic
Development. In filling the vacancies, Mr Perez increased the number of
serving military officers in his 26-member cabinet to two.
This was seen as a gesture to the armed forces, where discontent is still
high. Many middle and junior level officers in the army sympathised with the
grievances voiced during the attempted coup and there is concern these
officers will try again.
General Fernando Ochoa Antich, former minister of defence who is now foreign
affairs minister, has warned that Venezuelans are demanding 'important
changes' and that were the changes not achieved peacefully they would come
through violence. Gen Ochoa, a widely respected army officer, played a key
role in quelling the February military rebellion. Although a critic of the
current state of Venezuelan democracy, he is a staunch defender of the
democratic system.
The crisis has slowed economic growth. After posting the fastest growth rate
in Latin America in 1991 - of 9.2 per cent - economists now believe growth
this year will fall well short of the 5-6 per cent forecast at the start of
the year.
Inflation has proved stubborn - it is likely to be about 30 per cent this
year - and is running well ahead of wage increases.
Weak international prices for petroleum exports - which provide the
government with most of its tax revenue - have also forced the state to
scramble to deal with a widening fiscal deficit for 1992. This may have a
bearing on its three-year loan agreement with the International Monetary
Fund, which expires next March.
The government's main response to the crisis came in early March, when it
announced a halt to price increases for petrol, electricity and a small
group of medicines and basic consumption items. This remains the only aspect
of the unpopular economic reforms that the president has been prepared
publicly to alter.
He also promised in March wide-ranging judicial, financial and
constitutional reforms, increased social welfare benefits and renewed
efforts to punish past corruption.
The results so far have been meagre. The president managed to force early
retirements from some members of the Supreme Court, and to replace them with
politically independent judges. However, the impact of the new court on
Venezuela's generally corrupt legal system will take time to be felt.
The administration has produced reform bills for the financial sector, begun
overhauling the national health system, and increased the number of
scholarships.
Mr Perez has been trying to hammer together a 'national accord' with the
Copei leader Mr Eduardo Fernandez and other political figures and
businessmen. This would specify several high-priority economic and social
problems that the government would attack in its remaining 19 months in
office.
To date, however, the plan has not taken shape.
'Even after the February warning, the government continues to talk a lot and
to do very little", said Mr Freddy Rojas, president of Fedecamaras,
Venezuela's largest business association.

<TEXT>
THE Mexican government is to divide Petroleos Mexicanos (Pemex) into four
semi-autonomous divisions in an attempt to improve productivity at the state
oil company, widely regarded as inefficient, writes Damian Fraser.
The four subsidiaries will be responsible for production and exploration;
refining; natural gas and basic petrochemicals; and secondary
petrochemicals. Each company will be free to decide its operating and
investment plans, with full responsibility for financial results.
The subsidiaries will answer to a board of directors headed by the
director-general of Pemex and comprising members of the government and
petroleum industry. A statement from Los Pinos, home of President Carlos
Salinas, said the new structure would not affect any of Pemex's foreign
financial obligations.
Pemex is Mexico's largest company, with sales last year of Dollars 18.6bn
(Pounds 10.2bn), of which about 40 per cent were exports. The company, long
seen as a potent symbol of national sovereignty, came under intense
criticism after an explosion in April that killed more than 200 people in
Guadalajara, Mexico's second largest city.

FT  17 JUN 92 / Weinberger indicted on Iran-Contra charges
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN and ALAN FRIEDMAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR CASPAR WEINBERGER, US secretary of defence during the Reagan
administration, was last night indicted by a federal grand jury on criminal
charges stemming from the Iran-Contra scandal.
He becomes the highest-level US official and the first former cabinet member
to be charged in relation to the scandal, which centred on the clandestine
sale of weapons to Iran and the diversion of millions of dollars in profits
to the Nicaraguan Contra rebels. The diversions, in 1985 and 1986, occurred
in spite of a congressional ban on US military aid to the Contras.
In a brief television appearance last night, Mr Weinberger declined to take
questions but described the indictment as 'a grotesque distortion of
prosecutorial powers and a moral and legal outrage'. He said it was a matter
of record that he fought the Iran-Contra policies 'at every turn' inside the
administration.
He implied the special prosecutor had offered him a plea bargain - a lesser
charge in return for assistance in naming other government officials - which
he had rejected. He insisted he had co-operated fully with the special
prosecutor's investigations, including handing over private papers.
The 31-page charge sheet identifies five alleged offences; two of perjury,
two of making false statements and one of obstruction. Among them, Mr
Weinberger is accused of lying to Congress about his knowledge of the arms
sales and of Saudi Arabian contributions to the Contras.
The indictment of Mr Weinberger - defence secretary between 1981 and 1987
and now the publisher of Forbes magazine in New York - follows an intensive
effort by prosecutors to investigate allegations that top aides to President
Ronald Reagan engaged in a cover-up and withheld information from Congress.
Yesterday Mr Craig Gillen, the deputy independent prosecutor, denied that Mr
Reagan himself was a target of the investigations. 'I don't want to leave
any inference about other people,' he said in a reference apparently
intended to include Mr Reagan and Mr George Shultz, the former secretary of
state who has also been questioned.
It remains uncertain whether the indictment could have an impact on
President George Bush or lead to attempts by Mr Bush's opponents in the
presidential election campaign to revive the scandal as an issue.
In recent months the Iran-Contra prosecutors have also questioned General
Colin Powell, now chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and a former aide to
Mr Weinberger. Mr Powell is believed to have defended his former boss and to
have described him as someone frustrated in his efforts to stop the sale of
arms to Iran.
The indictment focuses on Mr Weinberger's statements in June 1987 to the
House committee investigating the Iran-Contra affair and on his personal
diaries, recently obtained from the Library of Congress, which apparently
contain several references to arms shipments to Iran in 1985.
He told the committee he did not know about the shipment of US Hawk
anti-aircraft missiles from Israel to Iran in November 1985 - and only
learned about the shipment when the scandal became public a year later.

Australia's ruling Labor party yesterday suffered another political blow
with the arrest of Mr Brian Burke, the former Western Australia premier, for
alleged misuse of parliamentary expense accounts, writes Emilia Tagaza in
Canberra.
The arrest comes only months after the laying of corruption charges against
another West Australian Labor figure, the former deputy premier, Mr David
Parker.
Mr Burke, until recently Australia's ambassador to Ireland, was arrested in
Perth by detectives from the Western Australian official corruption task
force. He faces five charges alleging that he obtained more than ADollars
17,000 (Pounds 7,000) from the parliamentary members' special travel account
through false pretences. He was released on ADollars 20,000 bail.

The trial of Mr George Tan, the former chairman of the collapsed Carrian
property and shipping company, was halted yesterday while the Crown asked
the UK when Mr Lorrain Osman, a Malaysian banker, would be extradited to
Hong Kong, writes Simon Holberton in Hong Kong.
Counsel for Mr Tan told the colony's district court that Mr Kenneth Clarke,
Britain's home secretary, had signed a warrant on Monday clearing the way
for Mr Osman's return to stand trial, with Mr Tan, on fraud and conspiracy
charges involving HKDollars 6bn (Pounds 418m) of loans from Bumiputra
Malaysia Finance.
However, Mr Osman, Britain's longest-serving remand prisoner, yesterday
avoided immediate extradition after his lawyers launched a fresh High Court
bid to win his freedom.

THE whereabouts of two German aid workers, the last western hostages in
Beirut, remained unclear yesterday despite announcements that they were
being freed, writes Lara Marlowe in Beirut.
Mr Bernd Schmidbauer, the personal emissary of German Chancellor Helmut
Kohl, kept his appointment with Lebanese President Elias Hrawi where he had
expected to receive Mr Heinrich Struebig and Mr Thomas Kemptner, whose
release was announced by the Iranian news agency on Monday night.
A statement from the kidnappers had promised the Germans would be turned
over at Mr Hrawi's residence. It was widely held that the two spent Monday
night at Syrian military headquarters in Beirut. Responsibility for the
delay was widely attributed to Damascus. Mr Schmidbauer thanked Mr Hrawi and
Lebanese officials for 'their valuable support' in freeing the Germans. But
he pointedly failed to thank the governments of Syria and Iran.

FT  17 JUN 92 / Algiers' corruption clean-up gamble: The risk of
demoralising officials while seeking trust
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TOSSING a bomb into a munitions dump was how one observer summed up the
likely consequences of Algeria's bringing to trial General Mostefa Beloucif,
who was arrested last month on charges of embezzling state funds.
Gen Beloucif, secretary general of the defence ministry from 1980 to 1987,
was widely regarded as the second most powerful man in Algeria after former
President Chadli Bendjedid, who stepped down in January. His arrest came a
few days after the publication by the daily El Watan of a confidential
report by a committee of five generals, including the current defence
minister, Gen Khaled Nezzar.
Gen Nezzar is also a member of the High Executive Council (HEC), which has
ruled the country since the electoral process was suspended five months ago
after the now-banned Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) won the largest share of
the popular vote in the country's first multi-party elections.
Algerian leaders may be gambling that a clean-up is key to winning a measure
of popular trust. Mr Mohammed Boudiaf, who returned from 28 years' exile to
head the HEC, has made clear his determination to root out corruption.
Senior colleagues such as Mr Nordine Ait Laoussine, the energy minister,
accept that the gravest challenge they face as they seek to implement
reforms - as complex and painful as any taking place in eastern Europe - is
'the credibility gap between the people and the leadership built up through
years of mismanagement'.
He recently told US oil executives: 'A large segment of the population has,
I am afraid, lost confidence in the capacity of the leadership to provide
jobs, housing, health care and its ability to combat corruption.'
However, a series of corruption trials is unlikely to reduce backing for the
more than 4,400 remaining alleged FIS supporters who still languish in
desert camps, and risks further demoralising civil servants and senior
technocrats.
The hitherto unthinkable is meanwhile happening in the economic sphere. Mr
Sid Ahmed Ghozali, prime minister, has conceded: 'There are no longer any
taboos. If shares in state companies have to be sold to private investors,
be they Algerian or foreign, we will do it.'
But more action will be needed to convince the private sector, the myriad
state company managers who are sceptical of reforms, western companies which
have signed up for investments worth nearly Dollars 2bn in 122 local joint
ventures since legislation was liberalised two years ago, and the IMF with
which a new facility is being negotiated.
Public enterprises - not all of which are in dire straits - are still
paralysed by the uncertainty about their future.
Many leading international companies have responded to the liberalising of
oil and gas exploration policies last year by signing contracts. Joint
ventures have also been agreed, many with private Algerian companies, which
allow for the manufacturing of pharmaceuticals, car parts, computers and
building materials.
As a gesture of support the International Finance Corporation, the private
sector lending arm of the World Bank, has agreed to lend Dollars 10m to
support a joint venture between the Algerian state oil company Sonatrach,
France's Air Liquide and Air Products of the US to build a helium plant.
Further foreign investment will depend in large part on domestic stability.
A second challenge faced by the authorities is to rekindle some kind of
dialogue with the fundamentalists. And, what is critical, the public has to
be convinced that economic hardships ahead will not be another opportunity
for a few people to line their pockets and foreign bank accounts.
Presidential elections could take place before the end of the year 'if all
the political conditions are assembled,' Communications Minister Abou Bakr
Belkaid said yesterday, AP reports from Algiers. Mr Belkaid, speaking to
foreign journalists, said the candidacy of Mohammed Boudiaf, president of
the High Executive Council which rules the country, is a 'strong
hypothesis.'

<TEXT>
Nelson Mandela, the African National Congress president, marches with Cyril
Ramaphosa (left), ANC secretary general, and Joe Slovo, ANC adviser, in
Soweto yesterday. The ANC had a successful start to its mass action campaign
yesterday, with most black workers observing Soweto Day by not going to
work, and no reports of intimidation or violence related to the stayaway,
Philip Gawith reports from Johannesburg. All the main cities reported large
stayaway figures. The Johannesburg Chamber of Commerce and Industry said 89
per cent of city employees stayed away from work. June 16, the day the
Soweto riots began in 1976, is traditionally observed as a public holiday by
the black community, so it was difficult to gauge the response to the ANC's
call for mass action. Many companies have negotiated June 16 as a paid
holiday for their workers. The streets of Johannesburg were devoid of the
normal bustle of hawkers, black-run taxis and pedestrians. Soweto, by
contrast, was a hive of activity, much of it centred on the Orlando stadium
for the main rally of 70 the ANC organised around the country yesterday. A
capacity crowd heard Mr Mandela say mass action would continue so long as
there was no progress at Codesa, the forum for constitutional negotiations
which have become deadlocked. Later, unknown gunmen opened fire on
pedestrians and motorists in townships around Johannesburg, killing 12
people.
Speaking yesterday in Ulundi, capital of the KwaZulu 'homeland', President F
W de Klerk said the government was anxious to move to power sharing in the
shortest possible time, but would not be bulldozed into an unsuitable
constitution.

<TEXT>
MR BORIS Yeltsin, the Russian president, yesterday issued a series of
decrees on trade and the exchange rates aimed at strengthening the rouble
and providing a firmer basis for privatisation.
The decrees include a reintroduction of tariffs on imports to Russia - all
tariffs were lifted earlier this year to encourage imports because of the
shortage of food and other goods.
Mr Yeltsin's decrees, due to come into force from July 1, are also designed
to underscore Russia's commitment to economic reform as it negotiates access
to loans from the International Monetary Fund.
Aside from the tariffs decree, Mr Yeltsin is also seeking to tighten up
Russia's exports regime. Other decrees include:
Unifying the various exchange rates of the rouble into one floating rate,
that set by the Central Bank, presently standing at Rbs85 to the dollar.
Allowing exporters to pay export tax in roubles rather than in European
Currency Units (ECUs).
Forcing exporters to exchange half of the hard currency earned rather than,
as at present, 40 per cent - but at the floating rate rather than at Rbs55
to the dollar at present.

FT  17 JUN 92 / EC central bankers try to put on a brave face: A committee
to design a Euro-banknote is set up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT was brave faces all round this week among Europe's central bank
governors. Threatened with the premature demise of their pet project -
European economic and monetary union - they responded by sowing the seeds
for future Euro squabbles of undreamed dimensions by establishing a working
group to consider the design of future Pan European bank notes.
The highly emotive subject of whose faces should appear on the notes - to be
used assuming that Europe moves as planned to a single currency by the end
of the century - is likely to be considered by the group.
That could lead to grave differences among member states on whether, for
example, Marie Curie, Goethe or Isambard Kingdom Brunel should be given
pride of place.
One official of the Basle based Committee of EC Central Bank Governors
stressed yesterday ) that the initial task would be to examine technical
questions, such as anti-counterfeiting measures and their potential use in
automatic cash teller machines.
Also under examination by the group will be whether the notes would be
printed by private companies or by the central banks themselves.
But this business-as-usual approach could not disguise the difficulties
ahead for Emu.
In a forthright speech Mr Erik Hoffmeyer, governor of the Danish Central
Bank described how the entire project could easily draw to a close.
Another banker said: 'We don't know where to go from here.'
Others closed ranks, noting the difficulties but deciding to carry on as
before with technical preparations - chiefly for the European Monetary
Institute, due to start up in 1994 with the job of overseeing the move to
full union.
Mr Lamberto Dino, deputy governor at the Bank of Italy, said: 'Emu will not
be born out of a clear sky. I am confident it will be refurbished with a new
treaty.'
Mr Wim Duisenberg, governor of the Netherlands Central Bank, said he thought
Emu in its planned form would probably still go ahead, though perhaps with
only a small number of countries.
But another central banker said: 'I don't see how Emu can work without
political union as well. Before the Danish decision, I would have given Emu
a 50 per cent chance of coming off in a majority of EC nations by the end of
the century - now I'd put the probability at 10 per cent.'
Mr Horst Bockelmann, economic adviser at the BIS and a former Bundesbank
official, said: 'It seems to me you just can't proceed as though nothing has
happened. It (Emu) is too big an undertaking to force it on people. If you
push too strongly, you may make things worse and have a less, rather than a
more, united Europe.'
For the moment, the central bankers can only console themselves with the
thought that if Emu is scuppered then some of their work will have
strengthened the system of pegged currencies fixed by the European Exchange
Rate Mechanism.

<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A COMPROMISE plan to keep Germany in the European Fighter Aircraft project
could mean production of the aircraft being delayed to allow time for Bonn's
budget crisis to ease.
Proponents of the scheme in Britain and Germany hope to put off the final
decision. This was to have been taken either next week, when the
parliamentary parties of the ruling coalition meet, or on July 1 when next
year's budget must be agreed in cabinet.
The overwhelming political consensus, however, remains opposed to the
sophisticated fly-by-wire fighter, seen as a symbol of conspicuous defence
consumption rendered obsolete by the end of the Cold war.
The idea of postponing a decision, understood to be backed by Mr Theo
Waigel, the finance minister and a supporter of the EFA, would be to include
a budget finance line for the project, but to allocate no money to it. Some
DM100m (Pounds 34m) is supposed to be included next year in preparation for
full production.
A similar idea was put forward by British MPs visiting Bonn yesterday to
lobby for the EFA, which is being jointly developed by Britain, Germany,
Italy and Spain.
They suggested that full production could be delayed to allow a
'pre-production' phase to go ahead. This would not require a final
commitment by Bonn to take the aircraft.
'Discussions are going on whereby the decisions regarding the production
phase can be put off,' said Mr Keith Mans, a British Conservative MP, and
secretary of the all-party aviation group in the House of Commons.
Germany was not proposing to pull out of the development phase of the
aircraft, for which it had already allocated DM6bn up to 1999, he said. He
detected a growing feeling in Bonn that, having paid the development costs,
it would be absurd to pull out of full-scale production.
Supporters of the fighter admit that the choice is between a German decision
to pull out of the project in the coming weeks, or postponing a decision for
at least a year.
They see no real possibility of the German government giving its approval,
with the latest public opinion poll showing that more than 84 per cent of
the population oppose buying the fighter for the Luftwaffe.
At the Berlin international aerospace exhibition this week, Mr Waigel
appealed for a calm assessment of the EFA project.
He warned against 'laying waste' Germany's defence aerospace industry with
an instant decision to pull out of the European fighter scheme.
By including an 'empty line' for the EFA, Mr Waigel might succeed in putting
off the final decision to quit, in spite of the expected recommendation to
do so by Mr Volker Ruhe, the new defence minister.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   DUBLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE POSTER reads: 'If you don't know, vote NO.' It is the latest in an
effective series produced by a group of anti-Maastricht campaigners in
Ireland.
Tuning into people's confusion, emotions and doubts as they prepare to vote
on the treaty tomorrow, the authors, a loose coalition of groups calling
themselves the National Platform, have emerged as one of the country's most
articulate voices against ratification.
National Platform was founded four months ago by Mr Raymond Crotty, an
economist whose name became known across Europe in 1987, when he held up
ratification of the Single European Act by dragging the Irish government
through the courts, eventually forcing it to hold a referendum.
His arguments, then as now, are that by handing more powers to Brussels,
national sovereignty in the key areas of economic, defence and foreign
policy decision-making has been, and is being, eroded.
Together with fellow Euro-sceptics from the social science faculties of
Dublin's universities, Mr Crotty has returned to haunt the Europhiles with a
low-key campaign that has sown doubts in many voters' minds about whether
European union will bring Ireland the many benefits its supporters claim.
Run on a shoe-string budget of IPounds 25,000 (Pounds 23,000), donated by
individuals, and relying on volunteers, the campaign has badly shaken the
government and party leaders, some of whom admit in private that the vote
could now be very close.
In its short life, the National Platform has evolved into an ad-hoc
'rainbow' alliance of environmentalists, peace and anti-nuclear groups,
liberal Christians organisations representing the unemployed, as well as
students and university dons, who oppose Maastricht for a variety of
reasons.
'We are not opposed to Europe, but we want renegotiation of the treaty,'
says Mr Gratten Healey, its chief spokesman. The group has steered clear of
the abortion issue, another of the big topics of the campaign, in order to
focus on what it considers the principal issues: sovereignty, Ireland's
neutrality, and jobs. As a result, he says, 'we have both feminists and
anti-abortionists working for us'.
The anti-abortionists say ratification will lead to legalisation of abortion
in Ireland. The radical women argue that the special protocol designed to
protect Ireland's 1983 constitutional ban on abortion has serious
implications for women's rights to seek information on, and referral to,
abortion services abroad.
Recent polls suggest that a high proportion of women voters are still
undecided, and so could swing the balance on polling day.
But equally crucial will be how voters view the No argument that Ireland may
be seriously disadvantaged by economic union.
Mr Anthony Coughlan, a senior lecturer in social policy at Trinity College,
and one of the Platform's leaders, pointed out several weeks ago that under
Emu 'we shall find ourselves members of a currency union that is not a
fiscal union - that is, that has no system of common EC taxes and public
services which would entail automatic transfers from the richer states to
the poorer, similar to those that exist between richer and poorer areas of
national states. . .it would be a repeat of our 19th-century experience of
economic and monetary union with Great Britain'.
His words have begun to take on a prophetic significance, in the light of
the Bank for International Settlements report, published this week, which
casts doubts on the feasibility of Emu, and the rift that has opened among
the 12 EC governments over the Delors II package of increased structural and
cohesion funding to the poorer member states, under which Ireland had hoped
to be a big beneficiary.
Doubts about the commitment to cohesion and economic convergence of other EC
members raise fears in Ireland that Emu will simply accelerate emigration
and capital flight to the economic power centres of Europe, leaving Ireland,
as one campaigner said, 'the equivalent of North Dakota in the US'.

FT  17 JUN 92 / MGN chiefs set to go today: Directors decide chairman and
head of finance should stand down
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE chairman and the finance director of Mirror Group Newspapers, one of the
two public companies at the centre of the Maxwell empire, are expected to
resign today.
Preparations for the departure of Mr Ernest Burrington, formerly MGN
managing director, who succeeded Mr Ian Maxwell as chairman early in
December, and of Mr Lawrence Guest, the company's finance director, were
made in their absence at a meeting of directors which lasted for most of
yesterday.
MGN was floated on the stock exchange 13 months ago. Its shares have been
suspended since December 2 when losses in the pension fund became apparent
and it is now in effect controlled by a consortium of banks.
After yesterday's decision on changes at the top of MGN, the directors
decided to consult Mr John Talbot, of accountants Arthur Andersen,
administrator to the private Maxwell companies. The private interests
control more than 50 per cent of MGN shares, which have been pledged against
bank loans.
Mr Talbot did not disagree with the proposed changes, which are expected to
go ahead today. The two men may remain with the company in other positions.
No impropriety is alleged on the part of either Mr Burrington, a former
editor of the People newspaper, or of Mr Guest.
An influential group of MGN directors, however, decided that resolute action
had not been taken quickly enough when the first signs of irregularity began
to emerge in the empire of the late Mr Robert Maxwell.
Mr Burrington has said he first became aware of impending trouble on August
29 last year, during a sports awards ceremony sponsored by the People at the
Savoy Hotel when he shared a table with Mr Guest.
During the lunch the Mirror finance director had expressed concern that
Pounds 40m appeared to have gone missing. The matter was taken further, and
all but Pounds 11m, said to be with the US stockbroker Goldman Sachs, was
returned to the Mirror.
On September 26, Mr Guest reported another money movement. After other
members of staff were questioned it was said that that money was on deposit
and would be returned.
During that month the two men were involved in rows with Mr Robert Maxwell,
who had accused them of troublemaking.
Mr Burrington has said he raised the question of his possible resignation
with Mr Robert Maxwell on October 2, but the matter was not settled before
Mr Maxwell's death on November 5.
The popular newspaper group - which publishes the Daily Mirror and Sunday
Mirror, People and the Scottish Daily Record and Sunday Mail - is trading
profitably but needs the support of the banks for working capital. A Pounds
250m two-year financing facility is now being negotiated.
Full accounts of the group are expected to be published on June 22 - setting
out its financial state and the sums missing from its accounts and pension
fund.

FT  17 JUN 92 / Government to scrap NEDC by year-end
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS and MICHAEL CASSELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE government severed its last link with the consensual approach to
economic management of the 1960s and 1970s yesterday by announcing the
abolition of the National Economic Development Council.
Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, said the tripartite - or corporatist  -
body would be wound up at the end of this year.
The NEDC was established in 1962 by Mr Harold Macmillan, then prime
minister, to encourage government, industry and trade unions to set a
framework for economic policy.
In a parallel announcement, Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry
secretary, said his department would restructure its links with industry,
taking on some of the work now undertaken by the NEDC's sectoral working
parties - known as little Neddies.
Some of the organisation's 100 staff will be offered posts at the Department
of Trade and Industry and elsewhere in Whitehall, but most face redundancy.
Mr Heseltine said his proposals, details of which would be announced before
the parliamentary recess next month, would lead to 'a more direct and more
effective relationship' between the DTI and industry.
He made clear that he did not envisage any role for trade unions in his new
approach to dialogue with industry.
Speaking in the Commons, Mr Lamont said that neither the National Economic
Development Office, nor the NEDC, its governing council, any longer
reflected the 'needs and realities of the British economy'. He stressed that
the government was determined to maintain close links with industry but not
in the forum provided by the NEDC.
Emphasising the government's sole charge of macro-economic policy, he added:
'The age of corporatism must be put firmly behind us.'
That view was reinforced last night by Mr John Major who told the Adam Smith
institute, the rightwing think tank, that his government would continue to
withdraw the state from the marketplace.
Industrial organisations shed few tears at the passing of the NEDC, which
had its heyday in the early 1970s. Some business leaders, however, expressed
concern about the future of the detailed sectoral work carried out by the
working parties attached to the NEDC.
Mr John Smith, the shadow chancellor, led opposition attacks on what he
called an 'act of industrial vandalism' which underlined the government's
complete indifference to manufacturing industry.
Dr Walter Eltis, NEDO director general, said he was 'disappointed' at the
closure of the office. Businessmen and trade unionists who had contributed
to its work were owed a 'great debt of gratitude', he said.
Mr Lamont, a critic of the set-piece clashes between government and trade
unions that have characterised NEDC meetings, decided immediately after the
April general election to scrap the council.
In what was seen as a compromise with Mr Heseltine, who has advocated a more
prominent role for the body under the direction of the DTI, it was agreed
that some NEDC functions should be preserved.

FT  17 JUN 92 / Big cuts in nuclear arsenals agreed by Bush and Yeltsin
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SWEEPING arms cuts to reduce the number of nuclear warheads in Russian and
US possession by more than two-thirds were agreed in Washington yesterday.
President George Bush and President Boris Yeltsin agreed to a two-phase plan
to cut their arsenals of warheads for long-range nuclear weapons to between
3,000 and 3,500 each by the year 2003.
They also agreed to eliminate the multiple warhead intercontinental
ballistic missiles (ICBMs), seen as the most menacing of all nuclear
weapons.
Mr James Baker, the US secretary of state, has been working for the past
five months with his Russian counterpart, Mr Andrei Kozyrev, on a pact to
take nuclear disarmament beyond the cuts agreed last year in the Strategic
Arms Reduction Treaty (Start.)
This treaty would have reduced the US arsenal from about 10,000 warheads to
some 8,500, including 1,400 loaded on ICBMs and 3,450 on submarine-launched
ballistic missiles.
The total Soviet force of about 10,200 warheads would have been cut to
6,450, including 3,150 loaded on ICBMs.
Although the deadline for completing the new arms cuts is 2003, Mr Bush said
they could be completed by the year 2000 if the US helped Russia to
accelerate the destruction process.
'With this agreement, the nuclear night recedes,' Mr Bush said. Mr Yeltsin
added that the agreement mirrored the fundamental change in relationship
between Russia and the US.
The Russian president said that, instead of laying down strict parity, each
country could select its own force structure within the 3,000-3,500 target
range. 'We know one thing: we shall not fight against each other,' Mr
Yeltsin said.
The agreement also provides for Russia and the US to work together on
developing a 'concept' for a system of global defence against missiles, as
well as opening the possibility of sharing early warning information.
The disarmament pact will provide a capstone for the meeting, the first
formal summit since the collapse of the Soviet Union.
But the agreement seemed to be overshadowed yesterday, in terms of US public
opinion, by Mr Yeltsin's revelation that some US prisoners of war might
still be alive in Russia.
The Russian leader raised this possibility on Monday, striking a chord with
US citizens, most of whom believe that some US servicemen listed as missing
in action during the Vietnam war are still held captive.
Following the announcement of the arms reductions, Mr Yeltsin said he
believed US POWs may still be alive in the former Soviet Union, saying he
would join Mr Bush in pursuing a full-scale investigation.
Mr Bush said a team of investigators would be sent to Moscow immediately to
look into the fate of missing US servicemen.
He said Mr Yeltsin told him that the prisoners taken by the Soviet Union
included those from the Vietnam era and from earlier wars.
While Mr Bush said there was no evidence that any of these Americans were
still alive, he praised the Russian leader for agreeing to open the archives
of the KGB and the Central Committee of the Communist party to help in the
search.
Downing Street said that the British government had been in close
consultation with the US on the arms reduction discussions well before the
summit.
Last night, Mr John Major 'warmly welcomed' what he described as a
far-reaching agreement.

FT  17 JUN 92 / Major denies Maxwell intelligence claim
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH and JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN MAJOR vigorously denied yesterday that the government had had any
intelligence information about the financial activities of Mr Robert Maxwell
before his death last year.
The prime minister came under pressure in the House of Commons about the
report in Monday's Financial Times that the government had intelligence
information that suggested Mr Maxwell was acting dishonestly.
Responding to questions from Labour MPs, he said: 'The government had no
information about Mr Maxwell's financial affairs as alleged in the Financial
Times yesterday - whether in 1989 or subsequently.
'I saw no such information, my office saw no such information, no other
minister saw any such information - for the very good reason it never
existed at all.'
He refused to be drawn on another element in the FT's story, in which Mr
Robin Robison, a former administrative officer for the joint intelligence
committee (JIC), claimed that other leading British and foreign companies,
largely in the defence field, routinely had their communications
intercepted.
Governments did not comment on security matters, Mr Major said, adding that
he had 'made the point perfectly clear on Maxwell because of the damaging
effects that the report could have had on the Maxwell pensioners'.
Mr Major's words were seen at Westminster as deliberately falling short of a
broader denial that Mr Maxwell had been the subject of intelligence reports
at all.
Mr Robison last night stood by his statements. He said: 'Most if not all the
JIC material of any relevance to this story was shredded and burnt a long
time ago, and Mr Major can only rely on civil servants who were probably not
in the PM's private office at the time.'
Mr Robison said not all the material handled by the JIC found its way into
the weekly intelligence summary that went to the prime minister and
othergovernment departments. He told the FT last night: 'All that I told you
about economic intelligence and the Bank (of England) being in receipt of
that, I am utterly confident of.'
Mr Robison added: 'As far as I am concerned the big issues are the way in
which intelligence intercepts are made on companies, and who is in receipt
of this information.
'I am very confident in my knowledge about JIC circulation of material, and
also how the system works.'
Some MPs have suggested that pressure on the government over the involvement
of the security services could detract from pressure on the banks to accept
a moral obligation and return pension fund assets used as collateral for
loans.
But the FT's report was raised by Mr John McFall, a Labour backbencher, who
said the allegations 'proved' that the government had more responsibility
than it had admitted.
Mr McFall urged Mr Major to make the Treasury use its Banking Act powers to
force the banks to return the assets.
The Treasury has said previously that it has no plans to become involved in
exerting pressure on the banks.
This, it says, is a matter for the special unit, led by Sir John Cuckney, in
the Department of Social Security.
Yesterday there were signs at Westminster that MPs campaigning on behalf of
the Maxwell pensioners were now turning their attention to financial
institutions in Liechtenstein.

FT  17 JUN 92 / Survey of Madeira (9): Embroiderers get the needle - The
handicraft industry is in severe difficulties
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON MAITLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GRETA PHELPS FIGUEIRA, great-great-niece of the Englishwoman who introduced
traditional Madeiran embroidery to the world, is despondent.
'The industry is finishing,' she says. 'It can't have any future because
nobody wants to learn embroidery. The young ones don't want to do it. They
used to be kept at home, now they can get jobs in hotels.'
Her ancestor, Miss Elizabeth Phelps, the daughter of a wine trader, took
samples of the embroidery to London in the 1850s. 'I think it was Queen
Victoria who gave her a boatload of linen to bring back to have
embroidered,' says Mrs Phelps Figueira. The word spread, and the cottage
industry grew to become one of Madeira's main sources of revenue.
Today, people no longer have time to handwash and iron beautiful
embroideries, and '90 per cent of the tourists aren't genuinely interested
in buying embroidery,' she says. Now 71, she came to the island to marry
more than 30 years ago, and she and her husband, Aurelio, still run an
embroidery shop, Figueira and Phelps, in Funchal.
Her gloom may not be fully shared by others in the industry, but there is
widespread acceptance that Madeira's handicraft industry, which includes
tapestry and wickerwork, is in severe difficulties because of its low
productivity.
About 30,000 people, or 23 per cent of the workforce, are occupied, mostly
part-time, in handicrafts, and they contribute just 5 per cent of GDP. Some
20,000 women do embroidery, often in addition to farmwork. They are paid by
the number of embroidery points they sew, and their annual earnings average
between Esc80,000 and Esc120,000, according to the Institute of Embroidery,
Tapestry and Handicrafts. A further 1,500 people are employed in factories,
designing, cutting, washing, ironing and packing the embroidery for sale.
Mr Fernando Sousa Viola runs such a factory near the port in Funchal. He
employs 45 people to process embroidery which he buys from 4,000-5,000 women
across the island.
In the factory office, hand-written ledgers, creaking wooden floors and
frosted glass panelling are reminders of a bygone age, but Mr Sousa Viola
has a modern business sense. He saw the writing on the wall 15 years ago and
concentrated on high-quality exports for the wealthy, who employ others to
look after their fine linen.
He specialises in elaborate tablecloths that can take three or four years to
make and cost as much as Pounds 2,000 each, and bed linen embroidered with
the customer's initials or family crest. His main clients are in the UK and
Germany, though he is hoping for an opening in the US.
The outlook for the industry is not brilliant, he says. 'Madeira embroidery
will never end, but it will be only for rich people, and the quantity
produced will be much less.' Government and industry officials suggest that
the number employed in embroidery needs to fall by half or even
three-quarters.
That is already happening. Many young women prefer the better pay and
environment of hotel work. 'Embroidery affects the eyes. You sit there and
have no contact with people,' says Mr Sousa Viola. Even established
embroiderers now refuse to work on the most intricate designs.
Traditional export markets are finding cheaper sources. Italy, for example,
used to take 75 per cent of the island's embroidery exports, but Chinese
competition, which Madeirans say is of lower quality, has reduced that to 70
per cent. Baskets and furniture, which are made from willow without nails or
glue, are also being undercut in their main market, the UK, by cheaper
Chinese and Polish wickerwork.
Exports of handicrafts still bring in about Esc2.7bn a year, twice the level
of purchases by tourists. While counting on growth in tourism, the regional
government is also studying ways of improving the export drive, says Mr
Fernando Severino Fernandes, president of the handicrafts institute.
The institute, set up in 1978, runs small training programmes for young
women in rural areas with a 75 per cent contribution to the cost from the EC
Social Fund.
Conditions for the embroiderers have improved. Apart from annual pay
increases, they are entitled to health care and a minimum pension at 62 in
exchange for 2 per cent of their income. Productivity is encouraged with
annual bonuses.

FT  17 JUN 92 / Survey of Madeira (8): Smiles on the bankers' faces -
Offshore Financial Services
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK BLUM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OF ALL offshore activity, banking and services have developed fastest.
Though the number of banks is still relatively small - there are 20 banks
and one insurance company - they have attracted a considerable volume of
business. And if the smiles on most bankers' faces is anything to go by, it
has been exceptionally good business.
No-one will say how much is deposited or what is the amount of funds the
banks are managing for individuals and private companies, but most bankers
agree that the volume of business has been well above their expectations.
Success has brought its own problems. The financial authorities in Lisbon
have been concerned that Portuguese resident companies have used the
offshore centre to reduce their tax liabilities. The government is planning
legislation to close loopholes for resident companies, but this will not
affect non-residents. Nevertheless, the issue has delayed other legislation
as well as exacerbating tensions between the Madeiran authorities and the
capital on the mainland.
What local banks fear is that the dispute over taxation could undermine
efforts to establish the centre internationally, and bankers stress this is
a domestic matter that involves only Portuguese residents. 'All these
mutterings about changing the rules are not helpful,' says one banker.
For the time being international interest is growing. 'We've had lots of
inquiries from Latin America, especially Brazil and from eastern Europe,'
says Mr Lino Bento, operations executive at the offshore branch of Banco
Espirito Santo e Comercial de Lisboa (BESCL), Portugal's third largest bank.
'For many investors the offshore centre is a door opening on to business
opportunities in Europe,' he says.
Portugal's decision to bring the escudo into the exchange rate mechanism of
the European Monetary System (EMS), has also encouraged investors because it
enhances exchange rate stability.
A high proportion of investments also comes from other offshore centres such
as Guernsey and the Isle of Man. 'Investors don't want to put all their eggs
into one basket, and Portugal's EC membership is an advantage over other
locations. Investors tend to start with small investments at first,
increasing them as they become more familiar and confident with Madeira,' he
says.
Other bankers confirm these trends. 'Interest in Madeira is growing, and it
is beginning to feature in the international scene,' says Mr Anthony Addis,
head of international private banking at Banco Comercial Portugues (BCP).
BCP was the first bank to set up an offshore branch in Madeira more than
three years ago, and it claims to have the largest share of the offshore
business. Its business is divided between private and corporate banking,
with most deposits from private clients and lending mainly to the corporate
sector. Many clients are drawn from Portuguese emigrant communities in
Brazil, South Africa and Venezuela.
As with all offshore centres there is always the risk some of the funds may
come from illegitimate sources, and Madeira's banks are keen to keep the
centre clean. 'It's something we discussed (among the banks), because if
there is a suspicion of any money-laundering in one bank, all the banks and
the system will suffer, so we check carefully all new clients,' says Mr
Bento.

FT  17 JUN 92 / Survey of Madeira (7): Old favourite revived - Vintners hit
by the fashion for lighter drinking wines
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON MAITLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHAKESPEARE'S hapless Duke of Clarence was drowned in a whole butt of it
after being stabbed. George Washington drank a pint a day. It was used to
toast the American Declaration of Independence, and the Russian tsars had a
fine collection that was recently unearthed when their Communist successors
fell from power.
Madeira's potent sweet wine has been known to the world for over four
centuries, and its extraordinary powers of longevity have been an enduring
source of marvel. Winston Churchill, another devotee, once exclaimed in
amazement when he realised the wine he was drinking had been made during
Marie Antoinette's lifetime.
These days Madeira has been left on the sideboard by the fashion for lighter
drinking wines, and the old-established shippers on the island are fighting
to keep their markets and upgrade a product which has lost its cachet.
'There's a great antipathy to fortified wines in the world,' says Mr Michael
Blandy, chief executive of the Madeira operations of the Blandy group,
founded on the island in 1811. 'It goes along with the antipathy towards
spirits and obviously it's an area of considerable concern for us.'
Too small to compete in the international wine market alone, Blandy's sold a
51 per cent stake in its Madeira Wine Company to Symington's, the leading
port wine shippers, in 1989, to take advantage of the latter's strength in
distribution and marketing. Blandy's still holds 40 per cent of the company,
which sells the leading brands established by British houses - such as
Blandy, Cossart Gordon and Leacock - and accounts for 33 per cent of total
sales of Madeira.
One of the company's aims is to reduce the proportion of wine sold in bulk.
This year bulk sales are expected to amount to 750,000 litres out of a total
of 1.4m litres. Most of this goes to France, and a few other European
countries, for cooking.
'What we want to do is promote the drinking wine. Selling bulk to the
cooking market does quite the opposite,' explains Mr Blandy. Following
promotion of bottled wine in France, the company expects to sell 65,000
litres there this year.
The once jazzy bottle labels have been redesigned, using refined lettering
and sober colours. Production techniques are also being improved, with
better filtration of the wine and more sophisticated controls during the
unique estufagem, or heating process.
This procedure, which gives the wine its slightly burnt flavour, was
developed by accident. The first Madeira grape, the sweet Malmsey, was
introduced from Crete in the 15th century by Prince Henry the Navigator.
Around the start of the 18th century, the story goes, a shipload of casks
was sent to a British regiment in India, but undelivered. Upon return to
Madeira, after the long journey across the Equator and back, it was found
that the taste of the wine had actually benefited from the heat and the
rolling of the ship. The baking process was simulated on land, first using
sunlight and later hot water pipes to keep the wine lodges warm.
Fortification began a few years later, when rumours of war kept ships away,
and merchants on the island added brandy to preserve their stocks.
At the height of its popularity in the early 19th century, at least 17,000
pipes (of 500 litres each) of Madeira were shipped each year, according to
an account by Noel Cossart in Andre Simon's Wines of the World. But the
vines were struck down, first by mildew in 1851, and then by phylloxera,
which hit Europe in 1860. At the turn of this century, an average 5,000
pipes were being shipped a year. Today, sales total a little under 8,000
pipes, or 4m litres, a year.
While production has been static for a decade, the European Community has
played an important role in upgrading quality, funding a programme under the
supervision of Madeira's wine institute to root out the poorest vines and
replant with superior ones in the limited 2,000 hectares available for
viticulture.
Under EC rules, too, Madeira may only carry the name of one of 'the noble
varieties' - Malmsey, Bual, Verdelho and the driest, Sercial - if it
contains at least 85 per cent of that grape in the blend.
The main overseas markets for bottled Madeira are the UK, Scandinavia,
Japan, and north America. The wine institute attends all the European wine
fairs, and next year will visit the US and Japan.
In its promotional forays to win the world back to fortified wine, the
institute has had to contend with a niggling problem over names in the US
and in Russia. It won its case in Russia but was unsuccessful in the US
where a wine is produced in California's Madera Valley.

FT  17 JUN 92 / Survey of Madeira (10): Reaching out to the world - The
future of the free trade zone looks more positive
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK BLUM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN the first phase of development of Madeira's free trade zone and
manufacturing park is completed this summer, an important milestone will
have been reached in the island's efforts to establish itself as an
international business centre.
After three hesitant years during which growth was hampered by bureaucracy
and outdated legislation which required almost as much effort to overcome as
developing the necessary infrastructure, the future looks more positive.
'It's a turning point for us,' says Mr Francisco Costa, chairman of the
Madeira Development Company (SDM) which is responsible for developing and
promoting the trade zone and the offshore financial centre.
Since the offshore centre was established, 21 banks and more than 500
trading and services companies have set up offices in and around Funchal,
the regional capital, but the most visible signs of offshore activity can be
seen at the free trade zone near Canical, a small town on the south-western
coast about 8km from the island's international airport and 30km from
Funchal.
Some 38 hectares of rocky hills have been levelled for factories, industrial
plots and access roads. A new deep-sea port is starting to take shape, and
is set for completion by September. The port is seen as crucial for the
future as it will permit direct shipping in and out of the zone, cutting
costs and time involved in transporting goods by road. It will be under
private management - an international tender for the management contract
will be issued this summer.
With only 10 companies registered for manufacturing so far, growth has been
modest, but Mr Costa is convinced conditions are ripe for much faster
development. Several companies have recently put in applications to operate
in the zone, and he expects many more.
Those already established have come from Portugal, South Africa, Brazil and
Hong Kong, attracted by fiscal incentives - no taxes until 2011 - the
prospect of European Community subsidies for training, low labour costs,
access to EC markets, and political stability. They produce clothes,
plastics, cigarettes, jewellery, optical and electrical equipment and food
products.
Mr Stanley Lam, of Sheenotto Industries of Hong Kong, manager of a clothing
factory, says low labour costs, good incentives and Madeira's location
between Europe and the US were deciding factors. The factory has 114
employees, including five from Hong Kong, and it exports to the US, Canada
and Japan. Access to the European market is limited by textile quotas and
the need to buy materials from the EC.
The company would like to expand its production capacity, now at around
60,000 items annually, but this will depend on winning EC approval for an
exemption to the quota system as the additional production would be aimed
primarily at Europe. All production workers are young women from the nearby
towns of Canical and Machico, Madeira's second largest city. 'There are no
problems finding workers here,' Mr Lam says. The company received Esc54m
from EC funds for the training.
A few buildings away, the Empresa Madeirense de Tabacos, the local tobacco
company which has moved production from Funchal to the zone, produces 36m
Portuguese brand cigarettes monthly. Mr Egidio Andrade, production manager,
says the move has helped to raise profits, and has led to a marked
improvement in production and work conditions. The factory is spacious if
noisy - a new ceiling is to be fitted to dampen the noise - and new
equipment has been installed. Mr Andrade says working conditions for the 75
employees - up from 65 in Funchal - are much better than before the move.
Employees work a four-day week.
Access to the zone has been improved, and the tunnel on the only road to
Canical and Funchal is being widened. By 1996, the airport runway will be
extended to 2,800 metres to enable bigger aircraft to land, and to allow air
cargo services.
A new international shipping register was established to add to the range of
facilities, but its development has been slow because of inadequate
legislation. Social security provisions for crews have had to be changed,
and other legal problems are expected to be resolved by the summer when a
new law comes into force.
Registered ships sail under the Portuguese flag, and according to Portugal's
law, at least half of the crew has to be Portuguese, making the register
unattractive for most ship-owners. The new law will abolish that requirement
except for ships calling regularly at Portuguese ports which will have to
have 50 per cent of their crew of EC nationality. Until then, the
authorities are waiving the requirement on a case-by-case basis. The law
will also allow lenders and borrowers to choose the country of jurisdiction
applicable for a mortgage.
The offshore banking and service sectors have grown fastest, and the centre
has attracted financial institutions and companies from Europe, Latin
America and the Far East, as well as from other offshore centres. Mr Costa
says he is satisfied with the rate of growth in Madeira's offshore business.
'The forecast that offshore centres were set to decline has not
materialised. Business has continued to grow.'

FT  17 JUN 92 / Survey of Madeira (5): Hotelier caters for tourists -
Profile of Dionisio Pestana
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON MAITLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DIONISIO PESTANA, like his father Manuel, has an instinct for a good
business venture, especially if it involves breaking new ground.
Imagination and hard-nosed management have helped make him one of Madeira's
leading entrepreneurs. His Group Pestana, with net assets of about Pounds
95m in tourism, property, air travel and offshore activities, is the
island's biggest. By his account, it has also become Portugal's largest
hotel group in terms of assets.
Mr Pestana, 40, was brought up in South Africa and only discovered his
ancestral homeland in his 20s. His father emigrated to Mozambique nearly 50
years ago in search of a better life. He built up property interests in
southern Africa, and then, in 1966, spotted Madeira's tourism potential,
buying a hotel in Funchal which was rebuilt as the group's flagship, the
Carlton. His son, armed with a business degree from Natal University,
visited Madeira on a working holiday in 1976. He never looked back.
It was just two years after the Portuguese revolution, and this gave the
young outsider an edge. 'The potential was so great,' he says. 'We were
really enthusiastic about doing things and buying, and the Portuguese were
very conservative and afraid. They had lost confidence completely.'
In those days, bricks had to be brought from the mainland, and the island
had little infrastructure. 'It took four years to build,' he says. 'The
progress since then has been like day and night. Today we can build faster
than on the mainland. We're building a 200-room hotel in one year.'
As well as the Carlton, the group owns the five-star Casino Park Hotel and
the concession for the adjacent casino, designed by the Brazilian architect
Oscar Niemayer. It has built timeshare and freehold apartments and in 1988
acquired 20 per cent of the Portuguese charter airline, Air Atlantis.
That year the group also took the unusual step for a Madeiran business of
investing on the mainland, buying 25 per cent of the Salvor Group, which has
five hotels in the Algarve.
Current projects include an 800-bed hotel in an 18th century palace in
Lisbon, to be opened in 1994, a smaller resort hotel on the Estoril
peninsula close to the capital, and three hotels in Madeira. 'If all goes
well, we'll open an hotel every year for the next five years,' says Mr
Pestana. 'That would double our capacity.'
The idea behind the mainland investments is to market a 'Pestana package' to
tour operators, giving credits for all the group's hotels so that
holidaymakers can spend time in Lisbon and the Algarve, as well as in
Madeira.
Mr Pestana's success, and the ease with which he has been able to develop,
especially in the much sought-after waterfront zones of Madeira, has not
made him universally popular.
But he appears confident of his ground, attributing the sector's dynamism to
Mr Alberto Joao Jardim, the regional president. 'If it's an investment that
will get people employed, he will endorse that project, and he doesn't want
to see any stumbling blocks.'
With tourism now the island's mainstay, the industry is debating where best
to focus next. Mr Pestana voices the dilemma: 'Madeira used to be a winter
resort. But summer is the best time, with late sunsets and the youth back
here from university. We need to capitalise on that.'
That means more night entertainment in the capital. But Funchal is
overcrowded, and new hotels should be developed elsewhere on the island.
There's the rub. 'The more we decentralise,' he says, 'the less chance we
have of creating the entertainment.'
To diversify, the group bought 70 per cent of the Madeira Development
Company when it was established in 1988 to manage the island's offshore
business centre and free trade zone.
That investment gave rise to another Pestana novelty - windmills. Taking
advantage of the tax-free environment, and the 50 per cent European
Community funding for energy-saving projects, the group plans to build 18
wind machines with a total capacity of 3MW.
The electricity company will buy the energy for the island grid, the group's
Pounds 1m annual electricity bill should be halved, and, Mr Pestana
concludes proudly, 'the project should pay off in three to five years.'

FT  17 JUN 92 / Survey of Madeira (6): Farmers have an uphill struggle on
the slopes - Agriculture is an important activity
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN Portuguese navigators first set eyes on Madeira in 1419, they found an
island covered in dense forest. Fires were lit to clear the land for
cultivation and legend has it that the island burned for seven years.
Today the regional government of Madeira - the word means wood in Portuguese
 -plans to extend what remains of the ancient forest by replanting it with
species of laurel and mahogany found only there and in the Canaries and the
former Portuguese colony of Cape Verde.
Under a four-year forestry programme worth Esc1.5bn, to which the European
Community will contribute, the authorities aim to buy up small woodland
holdings to protect saplings from grazing sheep, stop soil erosion and stamp
out fires that are often started as a result of quarrels.
The programme is just one aspect of the government's efforts to make more
efficient use of the land and improve the competitiveness of Madeira's main
exports.
Agriculture is literally an uphill struggle. Madeira, the largest island in
an archipelago, is the summit of a mountain range which erupted from the sea
bed, its highest point 1,861 metres above sea level. Fishing is unproductive
because the waters are too deep, so Madeirans concentrate on the land,
exploiting its fertile combination of volcanic soil and wood ash. The farms
consist of terraced steps built up the mountainside to the sheer rock face
or to the trees that crown the summit.
The terraces are kept in place with neat, grey stone walls and the land is
irrigated by a network of more than 1,000km of levadas, or channels, which
bring water from the wet north to the drier south. Cows live in small sheds
because the land is too steep and too precious to let them graze. Vegetables
are grown underneath vines in winter to double the capacity of the plots.
And on the most precipitous slopes farmers descend with ropes to tend their
vines.
Once dominating the economy, agriculture is now the island's second most
important activity, contributing 13 per cent of GDP in 1986, the latest
available figure. Some 22 per cent of the workforce was engaged in
agriculture last year, down from 36 per cent 20 years ago. Bananas, the main
crop, account for about 45 per cent of exports, followed by Madeira's famous
sweet wine, with 18-20 per cent.
Production remains highly inefficient. Over 80 per cent of the farms are
less than half a hectare in size, and many are dispersed, making economies
of scale difficult. About 20 per cent of the population is illiterate,
mainly in rural areas, and young people have found jobs in the service
industries around Funchal. Farming methods are often out of date.
To add to their problems, rural Madeirans now face the threat of competition
to their main export. The island sells 40,000 tonnes of bananas to mainland
Portugal each year. This is tiny in terms of the European market - indeed,
it meets less than half the mainland's needs  - but vital to the small
island.
In April, the European Commission proposed an EC-wide quota on imports of
much cheaper 'dollar bananas' from Latin America, instead of the tariffs
required by the Gatt. This protective measure requires a waiver of trade
rules from the EC's partners in Gatt, which is likely to be opposed by
producers in Latin America and the US multinationals which operate there.
If the quota plan goes ahead, it will give EC banana producers such as
Madeira and the French Caribbean islands a breathing space to adapt to
competition.
Madeira's agriculture secretary, Mr Jose Pereira de Gouveia, says he is
confident and worried about the future - confident the EC will stand by its
treaty obligations to protect Madeira's market and will take account of the
peculiar circumstances, worried because 'we have a lot to do to improve the
quality of our bananas'.
The government plans to reduce the land used for banana production from
1,700ha to 1,200ha over the next four years, cutting output to 30,000 tonnes
a year. At the same time, irrigation will be more carefully controlled and
taller plants producing bigger bunches will be introduced. A marketing
effort will be launched, emphasising the 'natural' methods of irrigation and
low use of chemicals.
Sugar cane, the source of Madeira's past prosperity, became uneconomic and
has virtually died out. However, Mr Pereira de Gouveia rules out abandoning
banana production. 'We can reduce the amount of land,' he says. 'But it's
impossible for us to have a substitute for bananas.' Indeed, he hopes that
the small, sweet Madeiran banana may one day find its way into the wider
European market.
Meanwhile, diversification of agriculture will continue apace. The 500ha
released from banana production will be used to satisfy local and tourist
demand for greenhouse products such as tomatoes and lettuces - Madeira has
to import many of its vegetables as well as meat, cereals and milk.
Exotic flowers are now being grown for export and the tourist market.
Orchids and strelitzia, or Bird of Paradise flowers, can be found in hotel
lobbies, packed ready for the flight home. Exotic fruits such as mango,
custard apples and papaya are being grown in greater quantities.
Restructuring requires money, and here too there is a struggle, this time
with Lisbon. Under its 1988-1993 agricultural programme, Madeira was due to
receive Esc5.3bn, 75 per cent from the EC and 25 per cent from Lisbon. But
the EC money depends on Lisbon paying up, and Mr Pereira de Gouveia says
only 14 per cent of the total has been forthcoming.

FT  17 JUN 92 / Survey of Madeira (3): New work opportunities for the young
 -The EC connection
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK BLUM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
YOUNG women watch assiduously as a chef prepares the pastry for a
traditional Madeira cake - a heavier, richer and far nicer sweet than the
bland imitation sold in British supermarkets under that name.
The large kitchen is spotless with an array of modern ovens and working
tables and a full range of cooking utensils. The students who listen so
attentively are on a cookery course subsidised by the European Community.
When the course is over they will take up a job in one of the island's
hotels or restaurants. In the not-so-distant past they would probably have
remained at home in a small village and done needlework at low rates of pay.
Choices were limited, especially for women.
But all that has changed. EC membership and a generous dose of EC funds have
helped to create new opportunities for most of Madeira's young people as
well as to help to transform the island. Still poor by European standards,
the island's economy is growing rapidly.
The scale of the change is striking. New roads, bridges, clinics and schools
have been built or are under construction, new services and new jobs have
helped to broaden choice for most Madeirans, especially for the young.
Officials say emigration has stopped, and Madeiran society is slowly opening
up.
'The European Community is perhaps the most important factor for our future.
All our (new) infrastructures have been made with EC support. Without that
support we could not have done it,' says Mr Miguel de Sousa, vice-president
of the Madeiran regional government.
Madeira is benefiting from so many different EC programmes that it is almost
impossible to assess exactly the amounts involved, but according to Mr de
Sousa, Madeira will receive about Esc50bn (Dollars 375m) in EC aid in the
period 1990-93, an investment representing more than 10 per cent of its
annual gross domestic product during the four years.
This includes a special EC multi-fund programme - known as Pop-Madeira  -
for the four-year period, under which Madeira will receive EC aid of Ecu219m
(Dollars 276m) towards investments totalling Ecu313m. The programme is
divided into eight sub-programmes with Community support ranging from 67 per
cent to 75 per cent of total investments - the highest ratio of EC support
in the Community due to Madeira's classification as a peripheral region with
special development needs. Projects are aimed at developing infrastructures,
tourism, energy resources, communications, transport, social and health
services, modernising agriculture, fisheries and industry, providing
training and protecting the environment.
It does not include additional EC support for specific projects such as the
necessary modernisation and expansion of the international airport which is
expected to cost around Esc60bn at 1991 prices, with the EC providing 75 per
cent of the finance.
Mr de Sousa says the level of execution of EC-backed projects so far is
close to 100 per cent.
As the economy is being modernised, old traditional industries are giving
way to new ones, and preparing a new workforce or retraining older workers
takes on added urgency. This is an area where EC help is also playing an
important role. Professional training is 100 per cent EC-funded, and this
has encouraged some companies to set up in Madeira. Training is carried out
either at the workplace or at the Centro Regional de Formacao Profissional
(CRFP), set on a hill overlooking Funchal. Mr Carlos Estudante, director,
says: 'We have low unemployment of around 4.8 per cent, but we have a very
young population. Education and training are very important for us.'
The centre has several workshops, classrooms, as well as the kitchen where
students were learning how to bake cakes. Some students live in, others come
daily, depending on their courses which can last three years.
Twice a year, EC officials visit Madeira to check on the development of
training programmes which have been allocated Esc6.1bn (Dollars 46m) from
its social fund for the period 1990-93. The regional government will
contribute close to Esc3bn bringing total planned expenditure on training to
around Esc9bn for the period. Over 18,000 trainees representing almost 14
per cent of the present workforce of 130,000 will have benefited from
EC-supported training programmes by the end of 1993.
But the centre not only provides courses in a wide variety of subjects from
cookery to industrial design and computing, it is also responsible for
supervising in-house training programmes carried out by companies. Its
inspectors check that EC funds given for training are properly used, and
that apprentices and trainees are given an appropriate formation. Mr
Estudante says: 'We want to make sure the training is of the right quality
and that it creates real jobs for Madeirans, otherwise it would be wasted.'

FT  17 JUN 92 / Survey of Madeira (4): A balmy resort off the beaten track -
Tourism is the islands' leading source of revenue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON MAITLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MADEIRA'S natural beauty, temperate climate and lack of crime are its
greatest attractions, according to tourists questioned in a recent survey
carried out for the regional government.
What spoiled things, they said, was the heavy traffic, noise and pollution
in the capital, Funchal, where the holiday hotels are concentrated.
At Reid's, the palatial 101-year-old hotel that caters to the top end of the
tourist market, a related concern is frequently expressed. 'What guests
don't like is all this building work,' says Mr Peter Spath, the hotel's
German-born general manager. 'They have seen other examples like the
Canaries and Torremolinos, and they're scared it will become the same here.'
These two complaints epitomise the difficulty facing Madeira's tourist
industry: how to achieve further growth without harming the island's natural
assets and antagonising the very segment of the market on which tourism
depends most heavily.
The majority of tourists are middle-aged or elderly people from Britain,
Germany and Scandinavia, who escape the north European winter for the
tranquillity and balmy temperatures of an Atlantic island lying 400 miles
west of Morocco. A good proportion come back again and again.
Madeira has attracted tourists for 200 years, building its reputation in the
last century as a health resort for Europe's wealthy and titled. At first
they came on ocean liners, later on flying boats, until the opening of the
airport at Funchal in 1964 put the island on the modern tourist map.
It has so far avoided the mass market - there are, for example, only 15,000
hotel beds compared with nearly 200,000 in the Canaries, and they are
concentrated in four-and five-star hotels. But tourism is profitable and the
industry is expanding fast. It has become Madeira's leading source of
revenue, contributing 23 per cent of GDP and employing about a fifth of the
workforce directly and indirectly.
Today, Madeira depends on tour operators for nearly 70 per cent of its
market. The change is not to every islander's taste. 'We're even getting
tourists who bring their own food,' sniffs an elderly expatriate.
In the past few years, many summer visitors have begun to arrive from
Portugal, Spain, Italy and France. The low season is confined to May and
June, and international conferences are being encouraged to take up the
slack.
About 470,000 visitors are expected this year, the same number as last year,
when Madeira benefited from an extra influx of tourists scared away from the
Mediterranean by the Gulf war.
The success of the industry inevitably suggests further growth. Demand is
reflected in the 75 per cent occupancy rate in Madeira's hotels. Ageing
populations in Europe and America mean more, better-off customers with time
on their hands, and Madeira has a particularly young population available to
serve them.
But the government is aware of the dangers of rapid development. 'The
quality of the environment will be important,' says Mr Miguel de Sousa,
vice-president in charge of the economy. 'People will seek quality. If
Madeira is successful, it will be on that basis.'
The plan is therefore to limit the increase in accommodation so that the
island has a maximum of 22,000 beds by the end of the century and to set
guidelines for new developments. Mr Carlos Alberto Silva, director of
tourism, admits that Madeira has not been strict enough with developers in
the past. 'Now we're making new investments more sensitive, using roofs with
tiles to keep the local character,' he says.
High-rise concrete hotels are still springing up in and around Funchal, but
there are examples of more harmonious building, such as the 38 apartments
and six town houses that comprise the luxurious Reid's Gardens development,
with red-tiled roofs and architecture which blends with the famous hotel on
the promontory above.
The government is encouraging new, smaller hotels and guesthouses in the
west of the island. A highway between Funchal and Ribeira Brava, 40 km to
the west, is due to be finished at the end of 1994. It will cut the journey
from half an hour to 10 minutes and bring the countryside to the city, says
Mr Silva. It will also ease the congestion in Funchal, where half the
island's 250,000 people live.
Another important development will be the 1,000-metre extension of the
airport runway, due to be completed in 1996 or 1997. This will allow
intercontinental flights, enabling the island to promote itself in the US
and Japan, and in South America, where many Madeiran emigrants live.
Few young families come to Madeira because it has no sandy beaches. But
there is a 9km beach on Porto Santo, an hour and half's boat ride or 15
minutes' flight away. The number of beds there has doubled to 800 in the
past three years, and further expansion is planned, up to a maximum of 2,500
beds, in the hope that tour operators will begin to sell package holidays
there - the island, although otherwise undeveloped, has a 3,000 metre
runway.
The lack of beaches on Madeira has encouraged the industry to develop other
outdoor activities and niche markets. Deep sea fishing and diving is
becoming popular. Two new golf courses, of 18 and 27 holes, are under
construction outside Funchal. Up to 30 different walks are available along
the irrigation channels, or levadas, that criss-cross the mountains. For the
business market, a 1,500-capacity conference centre is due to open in two
years' time outside Funchal.
So far there has been little foreign investment, but some of the big
international hotel chains are beginning to show an interest.
All this bodes well for the industry, though not in every case for the
environment. Some islanders and long-standing visitors fear that Madeira's
beauty will be ruined by tourism.
Others are more optimistic, believing that the island's cliff-lined coasts
and rugged, inhospitable interior will prove their own best defence against
the excesses of man.

the expansion of tourism and by Portugal's membership of the European
Community which has showered the islands, one of Europe's poorest regions,
with aid

MADEIRA, a small group of islands in the Atlantic some 900km south of
Europe, known for its natural beauty and a sleepy lifestyle is buzzing with
activity.
A visitor returning after several years' absence may berate the loss of
tranquillity in Funchal, the regional capital, as construction workers
hammer away at roads and buildings and rush-hour traffic chokes up the city
centre, but for most Madeirans these are signs of better times.
After several decades of near-isolation and grinding poverty, life in
Madeira is improving noticeably and expectations have risen. Madeirans are
still poor by European standards - per capita income in Madeira is less than
30 per cent of the EC average and only 60 per cent of that on the Portuguese
mainland - but living conditions are better than they were a generation ago
when emigration was the only alternative for many Madeirans looking for jobs
and a better life.
About 1m emigrants of Madeiran descent live abroad, roughly four times the
islands' current population of 253,000. Today, emigration has stopped, and
some Madeirans have returned, wealthier than when they or their parents
left, to start up new businesses. Unemployment has declined to 4.8 per cent,
though under-employment remains widespread in traditional industries.
There are several reasons for the change. The 1974 revolution in Portugal,
of which Madeira is a distant region, brought for the first time a
significant measure of autonomy to the islands, and local politicians were
quick to grasp the new opportunities.
Relations with Lisbon may be strained at times by Madeira's capacity to make
a nuisance of itself, but the fearless crusade launched by Mr Alberto Joao
Jardim, Madeira's somewhat eccentric but astute president, in defence of the
islands' interests has paid off. Madeira today runs much of its own affairs,
it has its own elected assembly, and the regional government can spend its
tax revenue as it sees fit.
Economic development was boosted, first by the expansion of tourism, then by
Portugal's membership of the European Community which has showered Madeira -
one of Europe's poorest regions - with aid.
Tourism, now the islands' most important source of revenue, expanded rapidly
in the 1970s and 1980s - between 1976 and 1991 the number of visitors more
than doubled. The islands' somewhat old fashioned image and its lack of
beaches helped to avoid the pitfalls of over-development and mass tourism,
but the industry created thousands of new jobs and demand for new services.
Then, as an autonomous region of Portugal, Madeira benefited considerably
from the economic boom that followed Portugal's entry into the Community in
1986.
Whether vision or chance was behind the decision to keep Madeira within the
EC - unlike the Canaries which stayed outside - no-one doubts it was the
right choice. 'The European Community has played an important role in our
development, and it is perhaps the most important factor for our future,'
says Mr Miguel de Sousa, regional vice-president responsible for the
economy.
The regional government has proved particularly adept at ensuring that
Madeira was not and is not forgotten in Brussels or Lisbon when budgets are
drawn up. According to Madeiran statistics, the EC has allocated through a
multitude of programmes more than Esc95bn for Madeira for the period
1986-93. This is roughly equivalent to Madeira's total gross domestic
product for one year.
The impact of EC aid is visible in new infrastructures, health care
provisions and improved training and education - a new university and
research centre are being established with EC support - though illiteracy at
20 per cent of the population is still a serious problem even if it affects
mainly older generations of Madeirans.
Moreover, a large proportion of EC-related investments have yet to be made,
and the next few years will see development accelerate. That help will be
vitally important as many of Madeira's traditional activities are declining
or face an uncertain future as international competition intensifies. The
completion of Europe's internal market by 1993 poses an additional challenge
to Madeira.
Agriculture is the second most important activity, employing 21 per cent of
the workforce, but it is inefficient and hampered by difficult terrain -
only one third of the land can be cultivated. Bananas are the main crop,
contributing 45 per cent of the value of exports, but Madeira faces
increasing competition from producers outside the EC. The area under banana
cultivation is to be cut back, and quality raised in an effort to safeguard
the crop's future. 'We can't stop producing bananas. If we stopped now, we
would become a desert,' says Mr de Sousa.
Madeira's famous fortified wine - not all of which is sweet - still accounts
for almost 20 per cent of exports, but it is facing increasingly difficult
market conditions in spite of attempts to promote it as an upmarket drink
such as port.
To overcome these drawbacks, the government is encouraging diversification
into market gardening produce, other tropical fruit and exotic flowers, but
in the long run agriculture is likely to lose more ground to newer
industries.
Traditional industries are also facing difficult times. Madeiran embroidery
is renowned for its quality, but it has become dependent on Italy as its
principal market, and even there, cheaper imports from China are undermining
the future of Madeiran exports. Many believe the industry's survival is at
stake as fewer people are willing to do the painstaking and poorly paid work
involved, and as markets are undercut by the arrival of cheaper, if less
elaborate, products from other sources.
To compensate for the decline of traditional industries, the government is
placing high hopes on tourism and the service industries, and on
transforming Madeira into an international business centre. After several
years of gestation, and slow beginnings, the offshore financial and services
centre is finally taking off with 21 banks and more than 500 companies
licensed to operate. The growth of a new industrial free trade zone in
Canical, on the island's south-eastern coast, has been slower, with only 10
companies licensed.
A new deep sea port at the site of the free zone will be completed in
September, and work on modernising and expanding the international airport
less than 10km away is due to begin later this year and to be completed by
1996. Along with other improvements to infrastructure and
telecommunications, this should increase Madeira's attraction for companies.
By bringing new industries to Madeira, the free zone is seen as a
potentially important source of new jobs. It will also reduce pressure on
Funchal which is fast becoming overcrowded and help to promote development
in the eastern part of the island.
But tourism will remain the most important activity. Its development will
have to be carefully controlled if Madeira is to retain its attraction as a
mid-market destination for those looking for quiet holidays in an attractive
natural environment.
Some diversification to encourage visitors in the low summer season, and
conference-related travel, may also help, though again, it will need to be
carefully thought out so as not to clash with maintaining Madeira's
traditional clientele.
The future is open, and Madeira is in the fortunate position of being able
to make its choices now as it rides the crest of an expanding economy.
Elections to the regional assembly are due in October and Mr Jardim's social
democratic party is expected to increase its majority further. This gives
the present team a unique opportunity to decide which way Madeira will go.
Mr de Sousa says: 'This decade will be a crucial one for Madeira. At the end
of it we will not be rich, but the most important things will have been
done. I'm optimistic.'

FT  17 JUN 92 / London Stock Exchange: Buyers return for Lasmo
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, PETER JOHN, JOEL KIBAZO and COLIN MILLHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
VAGUE BID speculation and a presentation by one securities house were behind
a strong showing for Lasmo, which jumped 10 to 209p, making it one of the
best performers of London's top 100 stocks.
Trading was active in the morning as an old rumour circulated that the
French oil giant Elf Aquitaine might be interested in buying the North
American assets acquired by Lasmo from Ultramar. Analysts tended to dismiss
the talk, saying there was no reason for Elf to wait until the assets are
offered to the public before showing its hand.
The pricing of the public offer is expected today and estimated at between
Dollars 1.07bn (Pounds 580m) and Dollars 1.16bn, and it seemed more likely
that pre-pricing excitement had prompted the Lasmo rise. Also, Lasmo's
broker, Cazenove, was said to have held a presentation to clients yesterday.
SmithKline up
The announcement of a joint distribution and development agreement helped
SmithKline Beecham to rise 7 to 889p. The pharmaceuticals group said it
reached an agreement with the US state of Michigan's Public Health
Department that will make SmithKline the exclusive US distributor outside
Michigan of vaccines for children developed by the state's public health
department.
Initial estimates of the gain to SmithKline were between Pounds 50m and
Pounds 75m. Mr Paul Woodhouse, a pharmaceuticals analyst with Smith New
Court, said the statement was 'further evidence that they are getting their
act together. People are worried about volume output, and little things like
this go some way to help.'
Vodafone rallies
After Monday's sharp fall, cellular telecoms operator Vodafone rallied as
some in the market decided that the rival Cellnet's move to restructure its
consumer operations was not the start of a price war that some observers had
concluded. Vodafone recouped 10 to 344p with 8.6m shares traded.
Reiterating his strong buy recommendation, Mr Evan Miller at Lehman Brothers
said: 'This was not the start of a price war because the Cellnet move only
affects consumer business. And as it will not come into effect until the end
of the year, the jury will remain out until well after then.' Strauss
Turnbull was also reported to have repeated its positive stance.
An early session buy order in life insurer Legal &amp; General was said to have
caused a squeeze, the shares closing 10 ahead at 393p.
Merchant bank Kleinwort Benson was also advising clients to switch out of
Prudential, steady at 250p, arguing that L &amp; G shares were cheap at the
moment while the Pru was 'fairly valued'. However, Strauss Turnbull was said
to be recommending a switch in the opposite direction.
Concern about the profits of London International Group, due to be announced
today, left the shares 3 easier at 258p.
Arbitrageurs were said to be behind an advance in Midland Bank of 10 to 435p
in heavy trading of 11m shares. The stock was also helped by a rise in HSBC
Holdings shares, which boosts the value of HSBC's takeover offer for
Midland.
Results in the electrical energy sector were in line with expectations and
had little effect on share prices. National Power eased  1/2 to 240 1/2 p in
spite of a raised dividend, while Norweb hardened a penny to 335p as profits
nearly doubled to Pounds 137.9m and the dividend increased to 17.7p from
10.94p.
International drinks groups had an advantage over the more domestically
orientated brewers, in view of fears that the recovery in the UK economy
will be sluggish. Bass moved ahead 11 to 604p as its Holiday Inns subsidiary
announced expansion plans in Czechoslovakia and other east European
countries.
United Biscuits declined 9 to 380p in an active business of 2.4m shares
after Smith New Court cut its 1992 profits estimate to Pounds 207m from
Pounds 216m and the 1993 forecast to Pounds 225m from Pounds 238m. Analysts
at Smith said trading conditions had continued to worsen since the company's
bearish statement at the annual meeting in May.
On the other hand, Smith agreed with the recommendation given to Unilever by
UBS Phillips &amp; Drew and County NatWest. Unilever jumped 11 to 944p, boosted
by news that County had added the stock to its list of 30 recommended
shares. This was based on the company's exposure to European countries with
strong earnings growth.
Other major food manufacturers traded nervously, with Tate &amp; Lyle losing a
penny to 375p on heavy turnover of 2.4m shares while Cadbury Schweppes eased
2 to 477p, as both suffered from fears that UK economic recovery will prove
elusive and margins in the UK and US are likely to be hit.
Technical rallies helped RMC and Redland gain 11 each to 559p and 509p
respectively. Rugby rose 6 to 195p as analysts reacted positively to a
weekend visit to the cement maker. AMEC firmed 3 to 143p as SG Warburg was
reported to be positive on the stock. Taylor Woodrow, at 98p, added 3
following a successful institutional lunch in Scotland.
British Aerospace shrugged off recent worries about provisions and the
dividend and bounced 12 to 306p.
Smith New Court, reported to have had a sizeable buyer, is positive on the
stock, as is Strauss Turnbull, where Mr Nick Cunningham believes the shares
have fallen far enough. He said: 'The company is unlikely to go for complete
closure of the regional aircraft division, thus the provisions will not be
as big (as feared).'
Increased appreciation of the successful bid for Dowty continued to boost
shares in TI Group, which climbed 14 to 368p. Helped by a Smith New Court
recommendation, Rolls-Royce firmed 3 to 166p on light turnover of 1.2m. News
of good orders at FKI lifted the shares 2 to 78.
Simon Engineering shed 5 to 243p after being dropped from County NatWest's
top 30 best buys. Kleinwort Benson was reported to have been a seller of
Smiths Industries, but the shares ended unchanged at 295p. Positive press
comment following Monday's results helped BET improve 8 to 144p.
Buying ahead of today's results from Cable and Wireless helped the telecoms
group rise 6 to 540p. After its recent dismal run, Euro Disney rallied 25 to
1173p. Profit-taking knocked 12 off package holiday group Airtours, which
closed at 292p.
Car auctions and security group ADT moved up 20 to 478p on the back of
buying in the US. Strength in Glaxo, up 12 at 735p, was also attributed to
US demand.
BP remained weak as a reduced profits forecast by Societe Generale Strauss
Turnbull weighed on sentiment. The shares slipped 1 1/2 to 258p.

FT  17 JUN 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Two-way trade keeps
Nikkei below 17,000

<TEXT>
SHARE prices fluctuated amid margin selling, and bargain hunting by
investment trusts, and the Nikkei average finally closed flat, ending below
the 17,000 level for the second consecutive day, writes Emiko Terazono in
Tokyo.
The 225-issue index closed a slight 0.30 up at 16,953.53 after a day's low
of 16,864.91 and high of 17,132.58.
Margin and index-linked selling depressed the Nikkei in the morning,
prompting bargain hunting which lifted the index temporarily above the
17,000 mark. However, rumours of a bankruptcy at a leading real estate
developer caused another sell-off.
Volume improved modestly from 210m shares to 230m. Declines led advances by
506 to 380, with 222 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first section
stocks ended 1.74 better at 1,307.21, and in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index
eased 3.81 to 1,016.80.
Prices moved on short-term activity, while most investors remained inactive;
analysts said the Nikkei index was fluctuating on technical signals.
Dealers once again accumulated positions in bio-technology related issues.
Morinaga Milk Industry, the most active stock of the day, advanced Y24 to
Y898 on reports that it had started joint clinical tests on an Aids drug
with a US pharmaceuticals group. Meiji Milk Products rose Y17 to Y988 and
Sanyo-Kokusaku Pulp, the paper company, put on Y6 to Y544.
Steel issues with large, long margin positions were sold. Nippon Steel
retreated Y4 to Y279, Kobe Steel eased Y1 to Y300 and NKK relinquished Y5 to
Y255.
Road construction companies advanced in the afternoon following comments by
Mr Shin Kanemaru, vice-president of the Liberal Democratic Party, calling
for a need to boost government road construction spending.
Maeda Road Construction appreciated Y110 to Y2,820 and Nippon Road moved
forward Y50 to Y1,360.
Electronic shares put on a mixed performance. Sony moved ahead Y20 to Y4,070
on buying by pension funds and investment trusts. NEC, previously sold
heavily on concern about weak profits, recovered Y2 to Y863 on bargain
hunting. Fujitsu receded Y5 to Y615.
In Osaka, the OSE average declined 38.21 to 19,919.21 in volume of 10.3m
shares.
Roundup
IT WAS a mixed day for the Pacific Rim region, with Hong Kong, closed on
Monday, strengthening after last week's disappointing performance.
HONG KONG responded to domestic bargain hunting and the Hang Seng index rose
27.68 to 5,846.75 in turnover of HKDollars 2.5bn. Analysts said the rise was
helped by demand for selected blue chips. HSBC gained HKDollars 1.25 at
HKDollars 45.50, Jardine Matheson HKDollars 1.50 at HKDollars 65 and Swire
Pacific 'A' HKDollars 1.50 at HKDollars 34.75.
AUSTRALIA weakened further, with industrial stocks and banks registering the
biggest losses. The All Ordinaries index slipped 7.6 to 1,639.4 in turnover
of ADollars 237m.
Among banks, Westpac lost 6 cents to ADollars 3.26 and Commonwealth dipped 3
cents to ADollars 7.25. Foster's Brewing, which on Monday rejected SA
Brewing's merger proposal, fell 7 cents to ADollars 1.99.
MANILA rose to a new intraday record high before slipping back and the
composite index was finally 2.92 up at 1,578.48 in combined turnover of 804m
pesos. Dealers said investors had been switching out of selected industrial
shares and into oil and mining issues.
Oils have shown gains since commercial production began two weeks ago at an
oilfield north east of Borneo island.
SEOUL saw selective buying of financial issues matched by profit-taking in
other sectors. The composite index closed just 0.14 higher at 579.95 in
turnover of Won293.5bn.
KUALA LUMPUR finished firmer after trading in a narrow range. The composite
index gained 1.98 to 602.15. Telekom climbed 20 cents to MDollars 13.80 in
volume of 838,000 shares, having scored a 40-cent rise on Monday.
TAIWAN's financial sector led the market down on profit-taking. The weighted
index shed 34.71 to 4,637.78 in turnover of TDollars 38.6bn.
BOMBAY's brokers boycotted trading for a second day over the government's
refusal to allow share transfers linked to the current scandal.

FT  17 JUN 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Generali pulls Milan to new
1992 low
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MILAN reached a new low for the year while bargain-hunting lifted Paris,
writes Our Markets Staff.
MILAN was pulled to a 1992 low by Generali in technical trading on the final
day of the June account. The Comit index fell 4.06 to 468.79 in turnover
estimated at more than Monday's L65.8bn as the screen-based trading system
came back into operation. Many stocks are due to go ex-dividend at the start
of the new account today, including Eridania and Burgo.
Dealers said there was no specific reason for the L350 fall in Generali to
L28,000, other than end-account position squaring. Among other larger
stocks, Fiat closed L45 higher at L5,245, but then slipped back to L5,215
later.
Sip was heavily traded, losing L39.50 to L1,311 in technical trading.
PARIS saw some bargain-hunting in blue chips such as Suez, up FFr4 to
FFr314, LVMH, FFr30 higher at FFr3,930, and Alcatel, up FFr5 at FFr633; but
trading remained modest. The CAC 40 index rose 13.27 to 1,931.41, in
turnover of FFr1.8bn.
Total fell FFr7.70, anticipating the fact that it is going ex dividend of
FFr7 today. Late on Monday the government said that it would sell 12.4 per
cent of Total's share capital by July 10 to domestic and international
investors.
Among smaller stocks, the home appliance maker, Moulinex, fell FFr3.60 to
FFr157.50 in spite of news that its UK unit had entered a joint venture with
Regal of the US, a move which won favour with analysts. The company also
said that it might raise capital and issue bonds in order to expand.
FRANKFURT had another quiet day yesterday, as it approached Thursday's
holiday and Friday's options expiry. Turnover fell from DM4.4bn to DM4.1bn
as the FAZ index rose 0.87 to 909.10 at midsession, and the DAX by 5.20 to
1,779.10 at the close.
The construction group, Philipp Holzmann, down DM30 on Monday, roared back
with a rise of DM70 to DM1,155 on a strong gain in group operating profits,
and expectations for further earnings gains in 1992.
In retailing, Asko rose DM26 to DM748 after a fall from DM838 at the end of
May. In both cases, said Ms Heidemarie Hoppner of B Metzler in Frankfurt,
there were indications that a selling order had been completed on Monday.
The special situation of the day was Schaerf, the office furniture company,
which raised the dividend by DM1, added a DM3 bonus, produced much better
than expected earnings and encouraged Metzler to take its current earnings
estimate up from DM25 to DM36.50. The shares rose DM29 to DM429.
ZURICH ended a moderately active session with the SMI index 15.6 higher at
1,881.3. Slightly lower money market rates, strong SMI futures and good
performances elsewhere in Europe supported sentiment.
Alusuisse, the chemicals and aluminium group, topped the active list as the
bearers rose SFr9 to SFr522. Roche certificates came second with a gain of
SFr50 to SFr3,380. The pharmaceuticals group is launch an American
Depositary Receipt program in about four weeks.
AMSTERDAM improved with a little more activity in view than on Monday. The
CBS Tendency index closed 0.4 higher at 128.8.
A stronger dollar helped sentiment with Royal Dutch improving Fl 1.30 to Fl
159.10 and Unilever gaining Fl 2.20 to Fl 187.00, a buy note from a UK
broker giving the latter an extra lift. KLM lost 10 cents to Fl 39.20, some
analysts noting that the airline's decision not to cut fares on its
transatlantic route was unlikely to have a big impact.
MADRID rose, a buy program in the last half hour of trade helping to boost
volume. The general index closed 1.90 higher at 248.78. Agroman gained Pta70
to Pta1,060 on rumours that Banesto, up Pta50 to Pta2,725, was planning to
sell its 50 per cent stake in the construction group.
STOCKHOLM closed fractionally higher after profit-taking wiped out earlier
gains inspired by better than expected four-month results from Svenska
Handelsbanken. The Affarsvarlden General index ended 2.0 higher at 950.10
with Handelsbanken B SKr1.50 lower at SKr53.
COPENHAGEN quivered as central bank sales of bonds at below-market prices
damaged sentiment already beset by persistent concern over Denmark's future
in the European Community. The CSE index fell 2.51 to 322.91, a new low for
the year, Danske Bank falling DKr6 to DKr275 and Unidanmark DKr9 to DKr163.
Danish banks have large bond holdings and take unrealised gains or losses on
bond and share holdings into their profit and loss accounts.
OSLO's poor performance continued with the all share index closing 3.11
lower at 428.62 in turnover of NKr221m. The insurance sector remained
positive with UNI Storebrand gaining NKr0.50 to NKr42.50.
HELSINKI held as Huhtamaki, the consumer products group, rose FM5 to FM128
on sharply higher four-month profits. The Hex index rose 0.5 to 791.8.

FT  17 JUN 92 / World Stock Markets: Telecoms weigh on Brazil and Mexico
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BILL HINCHBERGER and DAMIAN FRASER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRAZILIAN equities stayed weak yesterday, the Bovespa index falling 2.1 per
cent to 23,112 at noon following a drop of nearly 6 per cent on Monday,
writes Bill Hinchberger.
Fresh corruption allegations involving President Fernando Collor de Mello
compounded the fall on Monday, triggered by the expiry of stock options. The
Sao Paulo market's poor performance was also put down to a shying away by
investors, both foreign and domestic, from shares in Telebras, the state
telecommunications company.
Telebras was down 2.7 per cent by midday yesterday, after a 6.8 per cent
fall on Monday. Investors sold Telebras shares at the start of June when the
government suspended the company's ADR offering. There have been rumours
that the government may privatise Telebras's subsidiaries, instead of
selling off the holding company. Telebras has also announced disappointing
profit figures for April.
Meanwhile in Mexico, Telmex, the telephone company and bellwether stock,
pushed the market down 3.7 per cent on Monday, the largest fall this year,
writes Damian Fraser.
While the stock was marginally higher early yesterday, the market is more
than 8 per cent below the peak of 1,907 on March 26.
Mr Jorge Mariscal, of Goldman Sachs, attributed Monday's 3.7 per cent drop
in Telmex to fears about the free trade agreement, and the weight of new
equity that the market will have to accommodate. Next week, Banacci, the
financial group comprising Banamex, Mexico's largest bank, will offer
Dollars 1.5bn worth of stock to domestic and international investors.

FT  17 JUN 92 / World Stock Markets: Colombia in transition - Electricity
rationing and tax reforms have curtailed an extraordinary run, writes Sarita
Kendall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARITA KENDALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
After an extraordinary run which peaked at the end of January, the Bogota
equity market has dropped into an unsettled period. With electricity
rat-ioning to continue until the end of this year, tax reforms going through
Congress and the latest economic growth estimate down to 2 per cent, hopes
for a resurgence in the second half of the year have been dampened.
However, Colombian analysts see the current situation as a transition period
 -a breathing space after last year during which the market capitalisation
index tripled. The sudden boom was due to a big increase in share prices
which had been undervalued for tax reasons and which responded to changes in
legislation, combined with government policies to open up the economy and
attract foreign investors.
There are fewer than 200 companies listed on Colombia's Bogota, Cali and
Medellin stock exchanges. Despite recent growth, fixed income instruments
dominate and equities make up only 4 per cent of total trading - last year
stock trading reached Dollars 250m. Most of the larger registered companies
are in banking, textiles, food and cement, with the top 10 accounting for
about two-thirds of market capitalisation.
With equity prices now at a more realistic level and the first phase of
expansion over, the limitations of such a small market have become clearer.
Both domestic and foreign investors are drawn by the profitability of the
market while restricted by the small range of stock on offer.
The financial authorities have already approved more than a dozen foreign
investment capital funds, but for the present only a tiny proportion of
their potential can be channelled into the exchange.
Mr Fernando Arbelaez of the Bogota stock exchange says: 'Now growth depends
on new companies coming into the stock market. Some institutional investors
are going to be important too.'
Under normal circumstances, the liberalisation of the economy would have
created demand for funds to finance the modernisation of industry and
services. And the stock market would have been the natural place for many
companies to turn; but the electricity shortage (caused by a mixture of
drought and bad planning) and the resurgence of guerrilla activity have
weakened the government, undermining its economic strategy.
Not only are companies reluctant to risk new ventures, but the privatisation
process, which should give the market a boost, is moving very slowly. A
strike by the telephone company trade union gave the government a foretaste
of problems to come and led to the downfall of a cabinet minister.
The flow of returning capital continues unabated, with international
reserves exceeding Dollars 7bn. At the same time, foreign investors,
attracted by changing laws, rich resources and what Mr John Major, the UK
prime minister, called a 'bright' economic outlook on his recent visit, are
looking for opportunities. For the moment, however, the talk of creating a
bigger, more diversified stock market has not been translated into action.

FT  17 JUN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Cadmium market at 20-year lows
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CADMIUM PRICES have fallen to the lowest levels for more than 20 years in
the face of high stocks, environmental concerns and falling demand.
The bid price has fallen below 50 cents a lb. Some traders believe it could
fall to about 30 cents and remain there for several years. In the late 1980s
prices reached Dollars 9 a lb.
'It's a metal that simply ran out of steam,' said one trader yesterday. 'All
the news is bearish.'
Cadmium - a by-product of zinc mining - is highly poisonous and has been the
target of environmentalists. Rechargeable nickel-cadmium batteries for
gadgets like video cameras and portable telephones have made up the bulk of
consumption. But improving technology has reduced the amount of cadmium
needed in each battery, and new types of battery using no cadmium are on the
horizon.
At the same time consumption in paint pigments and PVC stabilisers is also
falling. One trader said yesterday that there was now only one major user
for the metal in the UK - two other big plants had been closed recently
because of environmental concerns.
Producer stocks of cadmium are already high, with some estimates putting
them at as much as 5,000 tonnes, compared with world consumption at betweeen
16,000 and 17,000 tonnes a year.

FT  17 JUN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: MMB seeks rise for
butter-making milk
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE MILK Marketing Board for England and Wales yesterday called for 'a
substantial increase' in the price of milk sold for butter following the
collapse of plans to reform milk pricing.
The board had intended to introduce a new way of pricing milk earlier this
year based on the supply profile, with a premium being charged for regular
deliveries. Milk production peaks in May and falls off sharply in summer.
The plan would have ended the much criticised present pricing system under
which 24 different levels are set according to the use to which the milk is
put. But it ran into legal problems with the European Commission earlier
this month. The MMB blames the collapse on the UK Dairy Trade Federation's
refusal to give up a part of the plan providing continuity of milk supplies.
However, the Dairy Trade Federation, which has to agree on pricing methods
with the MMB, said yesterday that its was disappointed at the MMB's
abandonment of the plan, which it believed could still be salvaged. It also
suggested that the latest pricing proposals were not in the interest of
consumers or - following CAP reform - producers.
Milk will continue to be priced under the 'end-use' system, with the highest
prices being charged for liquid milk consumption. At present liquid milk is
24.75p a litre, and butter-making milk is 17p a litre.
The MMB wants all prices to be raised, but it wants to narrow the gap
between the liquid milk price and the bottom range.
The board pointed out that the wholesale price of liquid milk was last
raised in December 1990. It believes that dairies can afford to absorb
higher prices without raising prices to the consumer.
The collapse of the price reform plan means that end-use pricing is likely
to remain in place until the 60-year-old MMB is wound up, probably in early
1994. The board plans to turn itself into a national voluntary co-operative.
Preliminary results of the MMB show that Pounds 2.23bn was paid to
wholesalers for 1991-92, up 1.3 per cent. The average price paid to dairy
farmers rose 4 per cent to 19.98p a litre. Production fell 2.6 per cent to
11.14bn litres, mainly because of quota cuts.
The board said continued high demand for milk for liquid consumption (50 per
cent of the total) has concentrated the effect of the quota cuts on milk for
manufacture, which suffered a 5 per cent cut in availability.

GOLD held steady on the London bullion market, maintaining support at
Dollars 342 a troy ounce. 'Gold hasn't really done anything since its rally
up last Thursday and Friday. We're not sure whether the precious metals are
consolidating or running out of steam. Short covering doesn't seem to be a
solid basis for a bull run,' said one dealer. Others said gold had held
above Dollars 340 in the absence of feared producer selling and might be
able to hold around Dollars 341 if good physical offtake emerged. The key
upside target on the charts remains Dollars 345. London's September COCOA
contract touched a new 16 1/2 -year low of Pounds 529 a tonne before
recovering most of the loss by the close. Dealers said the market continued
to be pressured by sentiment that key origins still have substantial
tonnages to sell. On the LME three-month TIN consolidated above Dollars
6,600 a tonne, absorbing selling, with the market maintaining its uptrend.
In Chicago WHEAT remained higher at midsession, with support keyed to short
covering after recent losses, and in sympathy with moderate gains in maize
and soyabeans. New York raw SUGAR touched lifetime highs in early trading.

FT  17 JUN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: SFA expels oil futures broker
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HOPE COMMODITIES, an oil futures broker on London's International Petroleum
Exchange, and its director Mr Ahmad Al-Rahmani were yesterday expelled from
membership by the Securities and Futures Authority on the grounds that they
had 'ceased to be fit and proper persons'.
The SFA, the securities industry regulator, has been investigating Hope
Commodities since it became aware of irregularities shortly before the
company went into liquidation in January this year with debts of Pounds
1.2m. An SFA official confirmed yesterday that it had passed information on
to the Metropolitan Police.
Mr Al-Rahmani, Hope's sole director, is accused of having improperly used
money deposited by a client with Hope for trading purposes. The authority
says the broker admitted that the funds were used instead to meet margin
calls and trading losses on other unnamed client accounts.
Information in financial returns submitted by Hope during 1991 was false and
misleading, the SFA says, showing an excess of funds when in fact there was
a substantial deficit. Mr Al-Rahmani is said to have admitted to the SFA
that he deliberately failed to disclose some debts, and that Hope was
probably insolvent from the beginning of 1991.

THE Hong Kong Stock Exchange is to allow companies incorporated in China to

Mr Paul Chow, exchange chief executive, did not provide a timetable for the
move. Although some minor, unidentified 'accommodations' may be necessary
before Chinese companies could list, he said they would provide investors
the same level of protection as do shares in Hong Kong companies.
Mr Chow ruled out the establishment of a special listing board set aside for
Chinese companies or the creation of a secondary type status.
A research paper produced by the exchange recently set out other
possibilities for Chinese companies to gain access to the Hong Kong market
other than direct listings. These suggestions have apparently been shelved.

FT  17 JUN 92 / International Capital Markets: Investment managers given
access to Swift but may snub system
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INVESTMENT managers have finally been allowed into Swift, the bank-owned
international messaging system - but many say they no longer want to join.
The decision to give investment managers access to the worldwide
telecommunications network of Swift was taken last week, when banks voted by
a majority of 95 per cent to make the change. Access to Swift will make it
possible for investors to confirm details of securities transactions direct
with their custodians using a standardised electronic format - potentially
reducing costs and settlement errors.
A public row erupted over the issue a year ago, when banks voted by a narrow
margin to keep investment managers out of the network.
At least three banks with considerable weight in Swift - Barclays, Chase
Manhattan and Citibank - had voted against letting in investment managers
last year. All three changed their stance last week.
Investment managers claim that the banks kept them out of Swift before to
force them to continue using individual banks' own in-house communications
systems. The banks, however, counter that Swift already had too much on its
plate and was not in a position to accept investment managers a year ago.
In recent months, a group of international investment institutions has
banded together to sponsor its own electronic trade confirmation system  -
effectively making membership of Swift less necessary. The banks' change of
heart is seen in some quarters as a belated attempt to encourage
institutions not to develop this system.
'The decision has come too late,' said Mr David Batten of SG Warburg, which
handles the settlement for Mercury Asset Management. 'They (institutions)
appear to have found a cheaper way of doing it.'
Many institutions regard the development of electronic trade confirmation as
a more important development than linking to Swift, and so will concentrate
their efforts in that direction. 'Our resources are finite. We have to
decide which will give us the quicker pay-back,' said Mr Andrew Palmer,
director of finance and operations at Legal &amp; General, the UK insurer.
The cost of joining Swift, at BFr1.3m, is also likely to put off all but the
biggest investment institutions.
With communications links and message formats becoming increasingly
standardised, it is becoming technically easier for investors to use a wider
range of bank custodians to handle their securities transactions, or to
switch between custodians more frequently.
However, banks maintain that this standardisation will not undermine their
competitive position. Investment managers are increasingly turning to a
single global custodian.

FT  17 JUN 92 / International Bonds: Spain in largest D-Mark issue by
foreign borrower
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SPAIN yesterday launched the largest D-Mark bond issue by a foreign
borrower, taking advantage of stable conditions in the German market to
launch an aggressively-priced DM2bn transaction.
The mandate to lead-manage the floating-rate issue was won by Dresdner Bank
following a competitive bidding process. Deutsche Bank and Commerzbank, two
giants of the German securities market, took part in the bidding but
unusually declined to participate in the deal.
The 10-year notes pay 6.25 basis points less than the six-month London
interbank offered rate. A Deutsche Bank official said a margin of 1 or 2
basis points under Libor was needed to sell an issue of this size.
However, six co-lead managers and 25 co-lead managers joined the deal.
Although the pricing was seen as aggressive by many participants, syndicate
officials noted that paper issued by sovereign borrowers carries a zero risk
weighting under bank capital adequacy guidelines - banks to not have to set
capital aside against holdings of the bonds.
Liquid, floating-rate bond issues by sovereign borrowers are also bought by
central banks as a low-risk method of investing currency reserves. From an
issue price of 100.15, the bonds were quoted at par bid by the lead manager.
Elsewhere, dollar currencies continued to benefit from uncertainty in Europe
over ratification of the Maastricht Treaty. Hydro Quebec, the Canadian
utility, officially launched its CDollars 1.2bn, 30-year global bond issue.
The deal, larger than the CDollars 750m transaction expected by many firms,
is lead-managed by Merrill Lynch and ScotiaMcleod. The bonds will be priced
today to yield 85 to 87 basis points more than Canadian government bonds.
Canadian National Railways launched a Dollars 200m five-year deal, increased
from CDollars 150m, lead-manged by ScotiaMcleod. The 8 1/4 per cent bonds
were re-offered to investors at a fixed price of 99.525, where the yield is
65 basis points more than Canadian government bonds. This was considered
fair by participants in the deal, which reported buying by both retail and
institutional investors.
OKB, the Austrian state-backed financial institution, launched a Dollars
200m, 10-year deal lead-managed by JP Morgan Securities.
The 7 5/8 per cent paper was re-offered to investors at 99.70, where the
bonds yield 26 basis points more than US government paper. The yield was
seen as tight by some syndicate officials. However, OKB carries a top
triple-A credit rating and is one of the most popular borrowers in the
Euromarket. This relatively small deal was easily absorbed.
Toyota Finance Australia, a consumer finance subsidiary of the top-rated
Japanese motor manufacturer, launched a ADollars 100m four-year issue lead
managed by Hambros.
The paper carries an 8 per cent coupon - the lowest in the history of the
Euro Australian dollar market. In the late 1980s, Australian dollar bond
issues often carried a coupon of more than 16 per cent.
While little new money is flowing into the Australian currency, retail
investors are re-investing the proceeds of maturing bonds. Around ADollars
900m bonds mature in July, and Dollars 1.125bn in August. The lead manager
quoted the bonds at less 1.5 per cent bid, comfortably inside full fees of
1.75 per cent.
The string of deals in dollar currencies looks likely to continue: a
supra-national borrower is thought to be planning a 10-year global bond
issue of at least ADollars 300m, although the lack of currency and interest
rate swaps opportunities could delay any deal; Japanese borrowers including
City of Kobe and Kanzai Airport are considering Eurodollar deals; the Asian
Development Bank is still hoping to launch a Dollars 500m 10-year issue next
week.

<TEXT>
A NEW master agreement, intended to simplify dealing in a range of
derivative instruments, has been adopted by the International Swap Dealers
Association, writes Richard Waters.
The agreement covers a wider range of derivatives than was included in the
previous version, introduced in 1987. By bringing more instruments under a
single agreement, it is possible for financial institutions to net off their
risks in different products against each other, reducing their overall
credit exposure.
ISDA said that 'hundreds of participants from Europe, Japan and the US' had
been involved in developing the new master agreement. The 1987 version and
agreements based on it are currently used in about 90 per cent of all
over-the-counter derivative deals, ISDA said.

FT  17 JUN 92 / International Company News: Gota offered SKr13.5bn in
protection
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SKr13.5bn (Dollars 2.4bn) five-year insurance rescue plan designed to
protect Sweden's Gota Bank from credit losses and unpaid interest represents
a bold attempt to stabilise its position and remove the uncertainties
surrounding the group.
The solution stems from an initiative of Gota's main shareholder,
Trygg-Hansa, one of Sweden's leading insurance companies, which still
intends to incorporate the bank as a subsidiary this year.
An insurance company has been set up to provide cover for Gota. It will be
indirectly owned by two triple-A rated European insurance groups, which have
not been named; JP Morgan; and Trygg-Hansa's holding company, which will
provide cover for about 11 per cent of the bank's credit portfolio, with a
maximum risk of SKr1bn.
The insurance agreement provides cover of credit losses of up to SKr6bn by
1996, as well as unpaid interest and remission of interest to SKr7.5bn. Mr
Gabriel Urwitz, Gota's president and chief executive, said yesterday: 'The
uncertainty surrounding the magnitude of our credit losses and their effect
on Gota's capital base should now be over.'
The insurance scheme has already been applied to Gota, helping the group's
results for the first four months of the year, for which it incurred
operating losses of SKr638m.
Without the insurance plan, it would have made credit losses of SKr1.36bn,
or 5.1 per cent of its total loan volume. Instead, credit losses amounted to
SKr210m. While Gota paid an insurance premium of SKr1.14bn, it utilised
SKr1.15bn to cover its credit losses.
The insurance plan may seem over-cautious for a bank with a risk-weighted
capital adequacy ratio of 11.8 per cent, well above the 8 per cent Bank of
International Settlements requirement. However, it underlines the
determination of Trygg-Hansa to ensure that Gota's troubles are resolved
quickly.
Two months ago, Trygg-Hansa bid for all Gota's outstanding shares, giving it
a SKr2bn equity injection. That bid still stands.
Mr Bjorn Sprangare, Trygg-Hansa's chief executive, said: 'Strengthening
Gota's financial stability is important to us. Our intention to incorporate
Gota as a wholly-owned subsidiary of our company remains unchanged.'

FT  17 JUN 92 / International Company News: Union Bank of Finland slides to
FM317m deficit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UNION Bank of Finland, the country's largest commercial bank, has reported a
loss of FM317m (Dollars 74.2m) for the first four months of 1992, writes
Robert Taylor. The figure compares with a profit of FM144m for the same
period of last year.
'Taken as a whole, 1992 will be considerably weaker for the UNitas Group
than last year,' said Mr Ahti Hirvonen, the chairman. 'The anticipated
upturn in the economy next year is likely to reverse the trend, but it is
still too early to estimate the speed of the change.'
The bank blamed the deficit on deep recession in Finland. There was an 181
per cent growth in write-offs on credits and guarantees, to FM419m from
FM149m last time. Net income from financing operations dropped 16.4 per
cent, to FM645m from FM771m. There was a 14.9 per cent drop in the bank's
total income, to FM1.14bn from FM1.34bn. However, the bank retains a healthy
capital adequacy ratio of 10.7 per cent.
Mr Hirvonen said the group was continuing to adjust to the situation, with a
one-third cut in the number of branches and 20 per cent reduction in
personnel.
However, he warned that Finland's high interest rates would have disastrous
consequences. 'It is a question of a threat to business and economic life
generally, which is also reflected in the banks,' he said.

<TEXT>
TURNOVER at M-Net, the South African cable television company, was up 50 per
cent in the year to March. Pre-tax profits climbed 36 per cent.
Turnover was R640.7m (Dollars 228.8), and pre-tax profits R62.8m. Operating
profits, meanwhile, were 56 per cent higher at R70m, largely due to a
growing subscriber base, up to 695,000 at March 31. The figures represent a
a 27 per cent penetration of the colour television market.
Profits were knocked, however, by a huge jump in tax, to R30.1m from R13.6m
in 1991 - previous trading losses were fully absorbed in 1991 and there was
a favourable abnormal item which did not recurr.
Net profits were unchanged at R32.7m. However, while attributable profits
were 18.5 per cent up at R27.8m, profits in 1991 were pulled down by a R9m
extraordinary charge.
M-Net, the third-largest subscription television service outside the US, has
been a star performer on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange since its listing
in August 1990 at R1. Last year it peaked at R8.60, but has since declined
to R6.20 a share. This gives it a market capitalisation of about R1.22bn.
Although management sees opportunities for growth in South Africa, it is
looking overseas.
M-Net is involved in cable television in Kenya and Namibia, and invested
R260m in a consortium to buy FilmNet, a European subscription operation with
about 500,000 subscribers in six countries.

<TEXT>
SVENSKA Handelsbanken, Sweden's third largest commercial bank, has reported
a 35 per cent fall in operating profits, to SKr664m (Dollars 237m) for the
first four months of 1992, from SKr1bn a year earlier.
The decline was mainly attributable to a 46.7 per cent jump in credit
losses, to SKr1.56bn from SKr1.1bn last time. The credit losses amounted to
1.6 per cent of total lending at the end of April.
The bank's receipts rose 6 per cent to SKr4.01bn, from SKr3.79bn, while
earnings per share declined to SKr2.98 from SKr4.57. Return on equity
dropped to 7.9 per cent from 12.5 per cent.
The latest results suggest that despite a more prudent and controlled credit
policy than other leading Swedish banks, the bank was now also suffering the
consequences of lending to property and finance companies in the late 1980s.
For 1991, its total credit losses rose to SKr3.2bn, representing 1.1 per
cent of loan volume.
Although Handelsbanken remains Sweden's most profitable bank, its rapid fall
in operating profits contrasts sharply with its 1990 results, when it earned
SKr4.558bn. This was the highest in its history, while at the same time its
credit losses were a more modest SKr623m.
The bank's underlying position remains strong, with total assets at the end
of April standing at SKr387.98bn, only slightly down from the SKr389.11bn a
year before.

<TEXT>
JAPAN'S money management funds - bond and money market investment funds -
have attracted Y2,000bn (Dollars 15.8bn) since their launch last month. The
funds are aimed at the retail investor.
Investors have been attracted by the higher yields of the funds, relative to
bank deposits. The sharp inflow of retail money to Japanese brokerages comes
at a time when individual investors are mostly shunning stock market
investment.
Fee margins on the money management funds are significantly lower than that
of stock trading commissions. Brokers hope the funds inflow will lead
eventually to investors shifting back into direct stock market investment.
According to the Investment Trust Association, 75 per cent of the collected
money was invested in long and short-term government bonds at the end of
May.
The minimum purchase price in money management funds is Y1m. Currently the
funds yield around 4.7 per cent. This compares with 0.5 per cent in ordinary
bank deposits and 3.29 per cent on bank money market deposits.
Banks have become increasingly concerned over the large inflow of money to
the broker-instigated money management funds, which look set to head the
securities houses' marketing offensive ahead of the summer bonus season.
Brokers also want to give the instrument a settlement function, similar to
that of a bank account.
The Osaka Stock Exchange plans measures to expand disclosure of trading
information in stock-index futures and options, AP-DJ reports.
The exchange currently discloses daily results of volume in the front-month
Nikkei index futures and three Nikkei options. From Friday it will also
disclose daily trading for other futures contracts, plus five options.

equipment business
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MINOLTA Camera will restructure its US subsidiaries and introduce an
early-retirement plan for employees. The move is unusual for a Japanese
company and a sign of the severe problems confronting the camera-maker.
Workers are to be transferred from the struggling camera division to the
office equipment division, on which the company is counting for a reversal
of its fortunes.
In the year to the end of March, Minolta reported a pre-tax loss of Y8.9bn
(Dollars 70.2m), its first in 26 years. It was forced to write off a further
Y16.9bn after agreeing to settle a US patent dispute.
The company said at least 70 of its 2,500 employees in the US would take
early retirement. A similar restructuring would be necessary for its
European operations.
Traditionally strong in foreign markets, which have been volatile in the
past year, Minolta's long-term strategy includes increasing the share of
domestic camera sales and expanding its office equipment business.
However, the company was surprised by an industry-wide fall in domestic
camera sales, including those of the single-lens reflex, for which it is
best known. The market contracted by 9 per cent, while prices for new models
fell by as much as 30 per cent.
Meanwhile, Minolta has had difficulty penetrating the crowded domestic
office equipment market, where its sales last year fell 5.6 per cent.
Encouraged by a 7.3 per cent rise in exports, it is placing more emphasis on
foreign sales. This new emphasis is reflected in the transfer of many of its
400 US camera workers to the marketing division for printers, colour copiers
and other business equipment. It has found the US office automation market
more accessible than the domestic one, characterised by loyalty to suppliers
within a corporate family, or keiretsu.

POLAND'S faltering privatisation programme received a much-needed, if
modest, shot in the arm yesterday when the European arm of CPC of the US
agreed to pay Dollars 8.8m for an 80 per cent share in Amino, a dehydrated
food producing plant in Poznan.
The deal is the second significant purchase by a foreign company in Poland
this year. In April ABB, the Swiss-Swedish engineering group, paid Dollars
10.4m for a 51 per cent share of the Elta electrical transformer factory in
Lodz.
CPC, which takes labels such as Knorr, Hellman's and Marmite, is commited to
investing Dollars 17m at Amino over five years with Dollars 5m going into
modernising the factory in the first 12 months. The balance will be spent on
general expansion.
Amino's 700 employees have been promised job security for 18 months. It is
Poland's second-largest dehydrated foods producer and its present range of
products will be continued, the company says.
Amino made a net profit of 6.3bn zlotys (Dollars 461,000) last year on sales
worth 191.5bn zlotys. The first five months of this year saw sales grow to
114.4bn zlotys, while net profits slipped to 2.7bn zlotys. Mr Mieczyslaw
Garstecki, managing director, said yesterday: 'We had enough of a profit to
survive, but not enough to expand. This is why we needed the foreign
investment'.
CPC has a production facility in eastern Germany and a joint venture in
Hungary. It hopes output from Amino will serve the domestic Polish market as
well as other east and central European countries. The US group is planning
to build a sales organisation and establish a catering organisation in
Poland to cover hotels, restaurants, hospitals and schools.
McDonald's is to open today its first Polish restaurant in Warsaw, employing

DIGITAL Equipment, the US computer group, has acquired BASYS Automation
Systems from Independent Television News of the UK as part of an 'aggressive
growth strategy' for the media industry and the broadcast market in
particular, Reuter reports from Maynard, Massachusetts.
Terms of the deal were not disclosed.
UK-based BASYS, which employs 160 people worldwide, supplies news automation
and management systems in more than 400 broadcast newsrooms worldwide.
Digital and BASYS, which is in the broadcast automation market, will
collaborate on such technologies as voice recognition, fibre-optic data
distribution interface (FDDI), and Digital's recently announced Intelligent
Building products.
FDDI is a standard for fibre-optic local area networks, which transmit data,
including graphic images, at very high speed.
BASYS, which will operate as a wholly owned Digital unit, said Digital's
investments, especially in open computer systems, will allow BASYS to expand
product development efforts in areas such as multi-media workstations and
databases, more aggressively.
Digital has been cutting costs and reducing staff in the face of a weakening
world economy.
In April it reported a net loss for the third quarter of Dollars 294m, or
Dollars 2.36 a share, compared with net income of Dollars 116.5m, or 94
cents, in the corresponding period last year.

TYSON Foods, the US fresh foods and poultry group, is to acquire Arctic
Alaska Fisheries in a merger deal valued at more than Dollars 200m, Reuter
reports from Springdale, Arkansas.
Under the terms of the deal, 0.5686 Tyson shares plus Dollars 2.23 cash will
be exchanged for each Arctic Alaska share.
Arctic Alaska said Tyson would issue about 9.47m Class A shares plus about
Dollars 37.2m in cash in the deal, which is valued at Dollars 212.4m, based
on the Dollars 18.50 closing price of Tyson shares on June 15.
Arctic Alaska, which earned Dollars 16.7m in 1991 on revenues of Dollars
225m, operates a fleet of 31 fishing vessels mainly in the 200-mile US
exclusive economic zone off Alaska, Oregon and California. Tyson said it
expected Arctic Alaska to post 1992 revenues of about Dollars 250m.
Arctic Alaska also operates two Seattle-based reprocessing plants as well as
shore-based fish processing plants in Oregon, British Columbia and China. It
also has an Idaho-based aquaculture enterprise and several joint ventures
overseas.
The merger is subject to certain conditions, including approval by
two-thirds of Arctic Alaska shareholders and by regulatory authorities.
Both companies' boards have unanimously approved the deal.
Nabisco Foods Group, a unit of RJR Nabisco Holdings, has agreed to exchange
its 32 per cent interest in Grupo Gamesa, Mexico's largest biscuit and
cracker company, for five of Gamesa's food and pet food companies and an
undisclosed amount of cash, Reuter reports.
The agreement is with PepsiCo's international snack food division, PepsiCo
Foods International, Gamesa's other owner. As a result, PepsiCo will own 80
per cent of the rest of Gamesa.
Nabisco will receive Gamesa's pasta, confectionery, dry desert mix, nuts and
pet food businesses, plus cash. The agreement returns to Nabisco two of its
well-known cracker trademarks, Ritz and Premium.
Sales of the transferred businesses totalled Dollars 85m in 1991, about 18
per cent of Gamesa's total sales.

FT  17 JUN 92 / International Company News: Sears responds to dissidents

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SEARS, Roebuck, the US retail and financial services company, responded this
week to shareholder discontent by making changes to the way the company is
governed.
At a special meeting in Chicago, the directors decided to make shareholder
voting completely confidential.
They also required directors to hold at least 1,000 shares of Sears common
stock and removed the company chairman from the committee that nominates
members of the board of directors. The committee will now be entirely
composed of outside directors.
The board also lowered the retirement age for directors and trustees of its
profit-sharing fund to 70 from 72, but it will allow serving directors to
continue their terms until aged 72.
Mr Edward Brennan, chairman, said: 'The board has listened to our
shareholders and has adopted a series of measures which we believe are both
responsive and in the best interest of the company.'
Mr Brennan also said the board would elect one or more outside directors
during 1992.
However, the measures did not go nearly as far as the shareholder proposals
presented last month at the company's contentious annual meeting.
These included proposals that a break-up of the company be considered and
that the posts of chairman and chief executive, both now held by Mr Brennan,
be separated.
In May, shareholders voted 41.2 per cent in favour of changing the
three-year staggered election of directors to an annual election. It was the
highest tally of any proposal considered at the meeting.
Mr Robert Monks, a frequent critic of Sears, said the steps were a 'nice
start', though more remained to be done.
Mr Monks was defeated in an attempt to be elected to the board in 1990, but
he hopes the board might choose him as a director this year.

<TEXT>
SOUTH Korean banks are to inject Won130bn (Dollars 165.3m) in Sammi Group,
the debt-plagued owner of the country's largest speciality steelmaker,
Reuter reports from Seoul.
The group had earlier asked its banks to extend Won144bn to rescue it.
The Commercial Bank of Korea, Sammi's primary lender, said the banks had
'agreed in principle to bail out Sammi, given its predictable adverse
effects on other industries'. Sammi said its total debts had snowballed to
Won1,780bn at the end of 1991, against total assets of Won2,300bn. Some
Won700bn of total was owed by Sammi Steel, its speciality steel subsidiary.
Sammi is also engaged in trade, precision machinery, aircraft and car part
manufacturing and electronics.
The group's financial position was hurt by rumours last year, denied by the
company, that it might be forced to file for bankruptcy protection from
creditors.
Analysts blamed Sammi's difficulties on ambitious expansion in the 1980s in
anticipation of a recovery in speciality steel which failed to materialise.
They identified as pointers to trouble a heavy investment of Dollars 260m in
three steel companies in North America in 1989 and an injection of some
Won300bn on increasing production of speciality steel in South Korea from
1988.

'clear improvement'

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PECHINEY International, one of the world's largest packaging companies,
yesterday forecast a 'clear improvement' in 1992 from last year's group net
profit of FFr582m (Dollars 110m).
Mr Jean Gandois, chairman of the group, a subsidiary of Pechiney, the
state-controlled aluminium maker, said profits were down slightly in the
first half but that there would be a very significant net profits recovery
in the second six months. Just how big the recovery will be depends on the
strength of drink can sales in the summer and the value of the dollar, he
told the annual shareholders' meeting.
He expected operating profits, FFr3.3bn last year, to remain stable after a
rise in packaging profits and a fall in contributions from Howmet, the
group's aerospace components division.
There will be a fall of between FFr350m and FFr400m in interest charges,
thanks to a reduction in debts from FFr15.2bn to FFr9.1bn, according to a
report issued at the meeting. The debt repayments are due to the recent sale
of aluminium and metal trading assets to the Pechiney parent and the
forthcoming conversion of warrants.
No large takeovers were planned in the short term, said Mr Gandois, but the
group would not hesitate to raise fresh equity next year if needed to fund
investment.
Rhone-Poulenc-Rorer, the pharmaceutical unit of the French state-owned
chemicals group, yesterday said it was in line to meet analysts' forecasts
of a Dollars 420m net profit for this year. This compares with Dollars 326m
net on sales of Dollars 3.8bn in 1991.

<TEXT>
THE Berlin city government gave its approval yesterday to the creation of
Germany's sixth or seventh largest bank by the merger of Berliner Bank, in
which the city holds 56 per cent, and three other banks in the German
capital.
The merged banks would have a DM130bn (Dollars 80.7bn) balance sheet total
and DM5bn capitalisation. Berliner Bank had long urged the merger with
Landesbank Berlin and Berliner Pfandbrief-Bank, but the city, anxious to
protect its stake in Berliner Bank, delayed the move.
Mr Norbert Meisner, Berlin's economics secretary, said earlier that the
merger would create a bank large enough to provide the increased investment
needs in Berlin and the surrounding Brandenburg state.
It would help reduce the burden on the city budget when Bonn is cutting its
aid to Berlin. Berliner Bank has benefited from expansion into east Berlin
and Brandenburg since 1990 and is the only sizeable German bank to have kept
its headquarters in the city.
