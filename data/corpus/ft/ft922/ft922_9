FT  15 JUN 92 / Labour leaders move to quell row
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LABOUR leaders were acting last night to head off damaging personal
recriminations over responsibility for the party's fourth successive
election defeat as the National Executive Committee prepares for a
post-mortem on Thursday.
The special one-day NEC will examine a report by Mr Larry Whitty, the
general secretary, which lays some blame on conflicting centres of power
within the group charged with overall control of the campaign.
Yesterday, however, Mr David Blunkett, an NEC member, was among a number of
senior Labour politicians calling for a halt to personal accusations. He
said the defeat raised questions far beyond the conduct of individuals. 'We
should concentrate on what went wrong and the real causes of the defeat,
rather than squabble about superficial aspects of the campaign,' he said.
Charges and counter-charges have flown between a group of individuals
reporting directly to Mr Neil Kinnock and full-time officers who conducted
the campaign from Walworth Road. The headquarters staff claim that some
individuals had too much influence over the campaign strategy.
Mr Whitty will argue in his report that senior politicians should in future
have a greater role in planning. Mr Bill Morris, general secretary of the
TGWU general union, has said for the the first time that he is prepared for
the influence of unions in Labour party policy to be reduced to less than 70
per cent.
His remarks, in Direct, the GMB general workers' union magazine, come after
a period in which union leaders, including himself, have been defending
Labour's links with the unions.
Some are reluctant to allow the union block vote to fall below 70 per cent
of this year's annual conference. Until now it has been 90 per cent.

FT  15 JUN 92 / Doubts over Nissan plant benefits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HOPES that the Nissan plant in north-east England will regenerate the local
economy are unlikely to be realised, according to a study published today.
Skills required to manufacture Nissan cars are company-specific and
components come from Japanese suppliers, according to The Nissan Enigma, a
book by two academics.
Mr Philip Garrahan and Mr Paul Stewart, lecturers at Teesside Polytechnic
and Cardiff Business School, say the increasing domination of UK motor
manufacturing by Japanese companies will harm the domestic motor and
components industries.
They also question Nissan production and methods of staff management, which
they say rest upon 'control through quality, exploitation via flexibility
and surveillance by team working'.
Nissan's success, they say, rests on a passive workforce resulting from
strict social control within the plant and high unemployment in Tyne and
Wear, coupled with government support and union restraint.
Nissan said yesterday that there would always be people who were critical of
success. The company had invested Pounds 900m in the plant and was proud of
its contribution to the growth of the 'new north-east'.

FT  15 JUN 92 / Increase reported in consumer confidence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CONSUMERS feel more confident about economic prospects over the next three
months, but their spending intentions are virtually unchanged from a year
ago.
A survey of households by PA Cambridge Economic Consultants suggests that
fear of unemployment and the depressed housing market are constraining
consumer spending. In particular, plans to buy cars, durable goods and
houses show no signs of recovery.
The private-sector research company said its latest quarterly survey of
consumer trends shows that although consumer confidence has improved to a
level as good as any seen last year, on balance more consumers are still
gloomy rather than optimistic about the future.
The survey says consumers' confidence in their own financial situation,
their employment prospects and the government's handling of the economy have
improved compared with the last three months, but pessimists continue to
outweigh optimists in the last two categories.
Just over 26 per cent of those sampled expect the number of people employed
at their workplace to fall over the next three months.
This compares with 27 per cent in the first quarter and 32 per cent in the
final quarter of last year.
SALES of National Savings index-linked bonds reached their highest level in
nearly two years last month. The amount invested totalled Pounds 211m,
contributing to gross sales for the month of Pounds 840m.
The highest single source of new income for National Savings last month was
fixed-interest savings certificates of which Pounds 226m were sold. After
repayments, including accumulated interest, net receipts amounted to Pounds
398m. The accrued interest was Pounds 154m, making the contribution to
government funding Pounds 552m in May.

FT  15 JUN 92 / Service sector pay awards fall sharply
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE level of pay settlements in the service sector fell sharply in the first
half of this year to an average of 4.4 per cent, the lowest since 1983,
according to the Confederation of British Industry.
Since Britain's entry into the European exchange rate mechanism the
competitiveness of the traded-goods sector has depended, in part, on pay not
rising faster than in competitor countries.
The service sector is not so directly affected, but employers' organisations
have stressed the importance of not allowing service-sector pay to be an
upward pressure on manufacturing.
The latest CBI figures suggest that service-sector settlements, which were
running at 6 per cent in the second half of last year, are now rising at
about the same rate as in manufacturing. Average manufacturing-sector deals
rose 4.3 per cent in the first quarter, excluding the one in seven
manufacturers that did not increase pay at all.
According to the government's annualised average earnings figures, pay in
the service sector has been rising at a slightly slower rate than in
manufacturing since April last year.
According to the figures for March this year, manufacturing pay rose at a
rate of 8.25 per cent and service-sector pay at 7 per cent.
Since August, according to the CBI, 44 per cent of employers have reported
low or deteriorating profits as a 'very important' downward pressure on
settlements in the service sector.
Over the same period, manufacturing pay deals continued to show a growing
divergence, with 15 per cent of those surveyed at or below 2.5 per cent; 34
per cent between 2.5 per cent and 4.5 per cent; 29 per cent between 4.5 per
cent and 5.5 per cent; and the remaining 22 per cent above 5.5 per cent.
Productivity gains among manufacturers making pay awards were rather low in
the first quarter of the year at 3.7 per cent, compared with 5 per cent in
the final quarter of last year, the CBI notes.

FT  15 JUN 92 / City urges release of secret retail data
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LEADING City economists have called on the government to release weekly
retail sales figures sent secretly to the Treasury which they say could give
extra economic insight to financial markets.
The economists say the government's access to the statistics mean that it
has additional up-to-date information which is not available to the City
when making judgments about areas such as interest rates.
They say the weekly sales information - supplied by a group of about 30
large retailers - should be more widely available to help the public debate
about the strength of any economic upturn.
Mr Peter Spencer, group chief economist at Kleinwort Benson, the investment
bank, said the figures should be published to help establish a 'level
playing field' for the government and financial markets.
Mr Bill Martin, chief UK economist at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, the Swiss-owned
bank, said the statistics gave the Treasury a 'small additional leverage'
when making decisions.
Mr Roger Bootle, chief UK economist at stockbroker Greenwell Montagu, said
he could see no reason for the data being kept secret.
Mr Michael Saunders, UK economist at Salomon Brothers, the US investment
firm, said the lack of wide dissemination of the data did not 'help to make
policy-making more transparent'.
Apart from the Treasury, the only groups which receive the data are the
retailers in the project, which is organised by the British Retailing
Consortium, a trade body. Companies involved in the scheme include
Kingfisher, Dixons, Burton, Boots and Sears.
The consortium said it hoped ultimately to sell the information to anyone
who wanted it. Some retailers, however, felt the figures might be
commercially sensitive.

FAR from falling in the aftermath of the Gulf war, oil company profit
margins have risen to record levels, according to Mr Frank Dobson, shadow
energy secretary.
They have increased their gross margin to nearly 39p per gallon compared

A report from the Monopolies and Mergers Commission in 1990 found that
margins of about 25p per gallon allowed the companies to make reasonable

Pensions Investment Research Consultants, which advises pension funds on

recommended.
The study also found that 75 per cent of companies already have a separate

FT  15 JUN 92 / Companies House wins funding privilege
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK and PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE TREASURY is to allow Companies House, part of the Department of Trade
and Industry, to fund its penalties division from the money it raises in
fines, in an unusual move beyond the normal rules of government budgeting.
Officials last week concluded a temporary arrangement which will allow
Companies House, based in Cardiff, to retain about Pounds 750,000 collected
during the current financial year from penalties of Pounds 20m that it
expects to receive from 150,000 companies. This will be used to cover the
costs of its new late-filing penalties programme.
The new programme begins on July 1 and will levy automatic fines of up to
Pounds 5,000 on any company filing accounts late. About 20 staff will work
on the operation and a Pounds 300,000 advertising campaign will be launched
to urge prompt filing.
Companies House is an executive agency under the government's Next Steps
programme, and also has 'trading fund' status which allows it to retain some
of the revenues it generates.
Several other agencies - including Her Majesty's Stationery Office, the
Royal Mint and the Central Office of Information - have similar arrangements
which allow them to retain a proportion of their income.
But the Companies House agreement is believed to be the first large-scale
example of an agency which will be able to self-finance some of its
operations with fines - a source of income which is designed to reduce over
time.
Normally government agencies must return any income they earn to the
Treasury, a process which has been criticised by the National Audit Office
because it fails to provide any incentive to improve productivity.
Mr David Durham, chief executive of Companies House, said he hoped that
within three years most companies would be filing on time and the sums
collected in fines would fall almost to zero.
The Central Statistical Office is to market economic data in pamphlets for
businesses as part of a project to increase eightfold its earnings from the
private sector over the next five years, Peter Marsh writes.
The scheme was devised by Mr Bill McLennan, the CSO director. He wants to
make more of the CSO's output relevant to business as well as its main
customers in the Treasury.
He said the target of increasing the CSO's private-sector earnings from
about Pounds 500,000 last year to Pounds 4m in 1997 was 'achievable'. That
would take the proportion of the budget gained from data sales to
non-government users from less than 2 per cent to about 10 per cent.

FT  15 JUN 92 / The Treasury's desire to save, save, save: There is a
renewed determination to tighten the reins on public spending
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AFTER the great binge of the past five years, public spending is facing a
crunch.
The backdrop is the government's determination to regain control of this
huge element of activity - amounting to some 43 per cent of total UK output
 -to arrest the steep deterioration in public-sector finances since the late
1980s.
In confidential Whitehall discussions, Mr Michael Portillo, the chief
secretary to the Treasury, will aim to keep spending in the financial year
starting next April within the Treasury's Pounds 245bn planning target set
out in the Budget. He is likely to press hard for savings or only small
growth in key areas such as education, transport, defence and health.
The government believes its comfortable general election victory provided a
new mandate to rein back state spending. It hopes that this will, in the
longer term, provide room for tax cuts and an expansion in private industry.
Nonetheless the ambitious and capable Mr Portillo faces some formidable
obstacles. The lingering impact of the recession will for some time push up
social security payments - accounting for almost a third of all spending -
and put pressure on tax revenues.
Also, the chief secretary will have to contend with the hidden demands for
spending that may have been triggered by the commitment by Mr John Major,
the prime minister, to efficient public services supported by the Citizen's
Charter.
As Mr Portillo focuses on paring back the bids for extra spending for the
three years from 1993-94 that Whitehall departments began submitting to the
Treasury earlier this month, he will ponder these factors:
The spending record: On present plans, total public spending as measured in
current-year prices and including self-financed local-authority spending and
debt interest will increase in the five years to 1993-94 by 57 per cent. In
the five years before this - between 1983-84 and 1988-89 - outlays increased
by only 27 per cent. Slide into deficits: While spending has raced away, tax
revenues have been hit by the recession that started around mid 1990. The
Treasury expects receipts to increase by just 30 per cent in the five years
to 1993-94. In the previous five years, when economic growth was relatively
high, revenues expanded by 46 per cent.
These changes explain why the UK moved from a small surplus on public-sector
finances in 1990-91 to a public-sector borrowing requirement this financial
year that will probably be more than Pounds 30bn.
Treasury forecasts: The Treasury underestimated the seriousness of the
recession, and therefore its impact on public-sector finances. In March
1990, it said Britain would repay Pounds 3bn of debt in 1991-92. In the
event, the UK had to borrow nearly Pounds 14bn.
The next set of Treasury forecasts, along with the agreed spending figures
for the three years from next April, will be announced by Mr Norman Lamont,
the chancellor, in the Autumn Statement. Future growth: Many economists are
predicting a slow recovery this year, but it seems unlikely that growth will
be high enough to reduce the PSBR by very much. The Treasury, which predicts
growth of 1 per cent this year - at the top end of City projections -
reckons that the PSBR in 1993-94 will be Pounds 32bn. Mr Bill Martin, chief
UK economist at the Swiss-owned bank UBS Phillips &amp; Drew and a noted sceptic
about recovery, thinks next year's deficit will be Pounds 38bn.
Financial markets: Efforts by Mr Portillo to trim the deficits will win the
support of gilt-edged securities market. The market is worried that, should
the deficits continue to rise, the Treasury may find it difficult to finance
them through gilt sales. Pruning the deficits will also make it easier for
Britain to meet the tough guidelines on public-sector finances set out in
the Maastricht agreement on European monetary union - assuming that the
accords survive.
Scope for cuts: Defence, which accounts for about 10 per cent of all
spending, will be a candidate for cuts, as will be spending on roads and
public transport. Another - highly sensitive - idea might be to investigate
how to trim social security spending by better targeting of benefits.
Efficiency savings: The Treasury hopes recent policy initiatives on health -
such as making individual hospitals and family practitioners responsible for
budgets - will lead to better-quality service without the sort of budget
increases seen in recent years. Citizen's Charter: It is an open question
whether the emphasis on making public services more orientated to consumer
needs will increase demand for spending. While the Treasury resists the
notion that the Citizen's Charter is an excuse for higher spending, some
believe that public-service efficiency could be helped in the longer term by
a large increase in investment - for instance in new government buildings
that consume less energy - which might push up the PSBR early on.
Wages: Good news for Mr Portillo is that inflationary pressures are likely
to be weak in the next year or so, due to the recession and the pound's
membership of the European exchange rate mechanism. As a result, the
government may be able to limit annual rises in public-sector pay - which
account for roughly 40 per cent of the public-spending bill - to low figures
in the region of 3 per cent to 4 per cent.
Long-term public spending trends: Mr Portillo may consider building on some
of the work in this field at the Treasury in the early 1980s, which focused
on such questions as the implications on health spending of technological
developments and demographic changes. However, ministers would first have to
reconsider Whitehall's traditionally secretive approach to examining public
spending, with a view to sparking a more public debate.

FT  15 JUN 92 / School-leavers likely to lose out in jobs revival
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JOB prospects in the third quarter of this year are set to improve, except
for people living in London or seeking work in the public sector, according
to the latest Manpower survey of employment prospects.
But another survey published today reports that there will be fewer jobs for
school-leavers this year than in 1991, with 11 per cent of organisations
surveyed planning no recruitment of school-leavers.
The Manpower survey found that 19 per cent of employers were planning to
create jobs, with only 13 per cent forecasting job cuts. Manufacturing
continues to predict a gradual improvement in job prospects, with builders
in the private sector now more likely to be recruiting than cutting jobs.
Clothing and textiles, retailing, and transport and distribution are the
most optimistic sectors. The most pessimistic are energy and water, local
government and banking.
London is the only region where a net 3 per cent of employers surveyed still
predict further job cuts. Scotland is the most buoyant, with a net 20 per
cent expecting to recruit, followed by East Anglia and the East Midlands.
The school-leaver survey of 186 employers by Industrial Relations Services
found that, of those companies which were still recruiting school-leavers,
one in three intended to recruit fewer this year.
The starting salaries for school-leavers are expected to average Pounds
5,854. Pay rates have risen about 4.7 per cent in the past year. More than
half of the jobs now include training leading to a qualification, but
school-leavers in jobs with high-quality training receive only 6 per cent
less pay than those in jobs where training is not provided.
Apprentices typically receive 50 per cent of the adult rate, with those in
clerical jobs receiving 75 per cent.

FT  15 JUN 92 / The Big Lie - Inside Maxwell's Empire: 'Tell the Queen I'm
busy' - The key to the fraud commited by Maxwell lies in the personality of
the man. A tyrant, he believed he could do anything, and built around
himself a medieval court to feed his enormous ego.  'He was a jackdaw with
people; he wanted them for himself' A bully when alive, he left his wife and
family a terrible legacy
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ROLLS-ROYCE swung out of London's Park Lane into Knightsbridge heading
for the Royal Albert Hall, where the Queen was attending a recital of
Handel's Messiah.
As the car threaded its way through the evening traffic, Robert Maxwell told
his French wife, Betty, he couldn't go with her as he had a business
meeting. He suggested she get out and catch a taxi.
'What am I going to tell the Queen?' Betty pleaded. 'Tell her I'm a busy
man,' came the reply. Maxwell left his wife near the Albert Hall and headed
for Henry Ansbacher, the merchant bank. He stayed until late that night,
drinking vintage champagne with Lord Spens, the corporate financier who was
later to become involved in the second Guinness trial. 'I was bored, I felt
like having a drink with the boys,' Maxwell told Spens.
Maxwell was a bully when alive; when he died, he left his wife and family a
terrible legacy. He also robbed 30,000 past and present employees of their
pensions.
The portrait that emerges from his treatment of both his family and his
employees is one of a man enslaved by egotism with delusions of omnipotence.
He had some good qualities: many found him an inspiration. Some shared the
sentiments of Betty Maxwell, who said the day after he died: 'Looking back
on our close-on-50 years together, I can see a kaleidoscope of never-ending
adventures, projects, achievements, tragedies, holidays, work and more work.
With him life was often tough, but the rewards were great.'
At heart, however, Maxwell was a tyrant, and it is that which holds the key
to the fraud. He built around himself a medieval court which fed his
enormous ego. This allowed him to believe he could do anything and created
the culture - fantastic, absurd, domineering, lawless, chaotic and paranoid
 -that made the fraud possible. Those who opposed his rules were banished;
those who flattered, soothed or entertained him stayed. In the same way that
he left others to pick up his dirty towels and clothes, Maxwell used the
people who worked for him to run the wheels of his empire.
The inner core of his court was his family. From his seven children, Maxwell
drew two - Kevin and Ian - into the heart of his empire. They became its
crown princes. Maxwell was fiercely proud of his family, but also fiercely
critical. He believed their lives belonged to him. This pressure on them
began early. George Ireland, a schoolfriend of Kevin, remembers that Maxwell
insisted that his son write home from school each week listing his
achievements. Kevin complained that 'no-one else in the school had to write
in such detail'.
At his daughter Ghislaine's 21st birthday party, he asked one of her
girlfriends for a dance, then took her into a study to cross-examine her.
'He wanted to know who my father was, how much he was paid, how many
servants he had,' says the friend, who found the encounter 'deeply
intimidating'.
He expected his family to be totally obedient, yet he could find their
demands and anxieties intolerable. He could be appallingly rude to his wife
when she fretted about being late for appointments. Once, when she was 17,
Ghislaine scalded her arm while cooking. Maxwell screamed abuse at her. She
fled to a friend's house for sympathy.
Maxwell took his obsession with his empire wherever he went. John Pole,
Maxwell's head of security from 1986, says: 'He would go home to celebrate
Christmas and be bored by Boxing Day. The family would gather for what they
thought was going to be a holiday only to find out that they were going to
work, but in a different country. He treated them like employees. Gradually
they needed to look to other things to maintain sanity and some family life
of their own.'
All but two of his seven children worked for part of his empire at some
point - but, unable to stand the pressure, most built separate lives. Anne
became a teacher in north London, and Philip is now a scientist. Twin
daughters Christine and Isabel emigrated to the US, although Christine
continued to work for a Maxwell company.
Betty Maxwell was stoical under the pressures of life with her husband,
insulated by her French upbringing and her chateau in south-west France.
However, just before Christmas 1990, she confided in Pole how sad it was
that her family was not only divided by the Atlantic, but no longer had the
reunions she remembered from when the children were younger.
Unlike the rest of the family, Kevin and Ian took central roles in their
father's business empire. In 1991, Kevin became chief executive of Maxwell
Communication Corporation (MCC) and Ian took the same post at Mirror Group
Newspapers (MGN). Their offices were in the cockpit of the empire on the
ninth floor of Maxwell House, a concrete octagon spliced on to the hulk of
the MGN building.
The doors of three lifts opened on to a long, narrow hall. The royal blue
carpet stretching its length was patterned with Maxwell's symbol, a capital
'M' stamped on a globe. Turning right, another set of double doors stretched
nearly to the ceiling. A click signalled that their lock had been released.
The heart of the octagon was in near-darkness. In the centre, a huge image
of the Maxwell globe was mounted high on a screen, spotlit; underneath it,
in the gloom, sat a receptionist behind a huge desk.
Anxious people were disgorged by lift or navigated the connecting corridor
with the Mirror and the finance department. Peter Jay - the former
ambassador to the US and once described as the cleverest young man in
Britain - who became Maxwell's 'chief of staff', the organiser of his
office, says: 'It was like a medieval court - people milling around in the
courtyard with their petitions, or waiting to grab the king's cloak as he
rushed by.'
Mike Molloy, former editor of the Daily Mirror, says: 'Maxwell was theatre,
he was looking for an image.' He loved dressing up. For tycoon Malcolm
Forbes' birthday party, he ordered a sultan's silk pyjamas, turban and gold
shoes with curled-up toes. He had a Polish captain's uniform made to mark
the anniversary of Poland's entry into the Second World War, even though he
was not entitled to wear it. His favourite pork pie hat gave way first to a
peasant's cap from his Ethiopian mercy mission, and then a fedora. 'He
finally settled on baseball caps, and the cloakroom in Maxwell House was
full of them,' says Molloy.
Maxwell rejected all constraints. To him, 'Have a nice day,' was a
presumption; 'I'll have whatever kind of day I like,' he would reply.
Jay says: 'He was not just disorderly, he actively abhorred order. The key
to the man was that he had the lowest threshold of boredom. He would come in
and say: 'What shall I do?' He'd get an idea and start ringing people. They
would turn up and wait to be told what to do, by which time he would be on
to something else . . . from grotesque schemes for transforming the world to
fantastic rows about running newspapers.'
This 'whirling chaos' which Maxwell created around him, in Jay's words,
obscured the truth and, ultimately, made the fraud possible.
In a satirical note to his successor as chief of staff, Jay warned: 'The job
is essentially administration, a process of which the chairman is deeply
suspicious and profoundly uncomprehending.'
Jay says: 'Maxwell never read anything unless it arrived by fax.' The
Maxwell House post became unmanageable. Several hundred letters a day, many
with cheques enclosed, would pile up unopened.
Maxwell hired a bizarre coterie of courtiers. Anyone who took his fancy
could be found a role in some corner of the empire. Many stayed, at least
for a while. But many others moved away, finding it intolerable. In the
frantic last two years of his life, the inner circle dwindled to an ever
smaller band. Many of those who had opposed him left.
Kevin was the favoured son, chief executive of the larger of the two public
companies, with a connecting door from his office to his father's. Below
Maxwell's two sons was a sprawling retinue. 'Everyone had to report direct
to Maxwell,' says Jay. 'He was a jackdaw with people; he wanted them for
himself.'
These people included those with a defined role, such as the directors of
MCC and MGN. But there was also a small band of financial fixers whose roles
were less clearly defined. This group, including Michael Stoney, Robert Bunn
and Larry Trachtenberg, operated at the heart of Maxwell's private labyrinth
of companies.
Another group of long-standing employees had roles straddling the court and
the family. Les Williams was Maxwell's driver. Although Maxwell would not
admit to wanting a bodyguard, Williams performed that role too. He also
helped bug the Maxwell House offices. Bob Cole worked for Maxwell for 31
years. For the last 12 years of Maxwell's life Cole was his press spokesman.
But he was also a family confidant who dressed up as Father Christmas for
parties at Kevin's children's school.
Maxwell particularly liked to collect people with titles, badges or rank.
Jay was one of his trophies. So were Lord Donoughue, one-time adviser to
former prime minister James Callaghan; and Sir John Morgan, former British
ambassador to Mexico. Cole says: 'He used to pick them up at cocktail
parties, Labour party conferences. He made a real pest of himself pursuing
Angus Ogilvy at a party several years ago.'
Once these people had joined Maxwell's staff they had to suffer the same
absurd decrees as other members. Pole says: 'It didn't matter whether you
were a City banker, a member of his family or a peer of the realm, all got
treated equally. Once you took the king's shilling and accepted the salary
and the conditions, Maxwell believed he had bought you lock, stock and
barrel.'
Maxwell would call Jay in the middle of the night to ask the time. He sent
one finance director on a 14-hour flight to Hong Kong - and summoned him
back on the return flight to ask three trivial questions which the man had
already answered in a note. One of his finance assistants had a direct line
from Maxwell: 'Sometimes he'd ring just to ask: 'Why haven't you spoken to
me recently?''
Like the Queen, Maxwell never carried money. He relied on acolytes scurrying
behind him to produce change, in whatever currency was needed, as he
stretched out his hands to take sandwiches, mementoes, bottles of beer. One
director remembers: 'One day at a football match I had to give him change
just so that he could throw handfuls into the crowd.'
His sons were often treated as badly as the rest. He shouted at them in the
same way he would shout at the chauffeur or gardener, and he repeatedly
called Kevin back from holidays with his family.
Molloy says: 'There were Thomas Mores in the court as well as fools. Some
would not put up with his nonsense and were not pushed. Others were treated
despicably. He instinctively, intuitively knew what people would take - he
was very feminine in many ways.'
As part of that calculation, like a feudal baron, Maxwell would bestow
praise and rewards. 'Look at that, that is true service,' he would say,
pressing Dollars 200 into Cole's hand. 'Get something for your wife.' But he
was generous only in front of an audience, says Cole, and could be
astonishingly mean. To compensate Cole for staying late on his wife's
birthday, Maxwell said: 'Give the man a bottle of champagne' - but then
overruled the receptionist's selection of Dom Perignon in favour of a
cheaper bottle of Mumm.
Formal job titles counted for nothing; what counted was whether someone was
in or out of favour. It made the directors' jobs impossible, stripping them
of information and authority. Pole adds: 'Maxwell would put you in a
cupboard and open it only when he wanted you to do something for him. Often
there would be three or four people doing the same job for him without
knowing about the others.'
This led to an atmosphere of intrigue, ingratiation and back-stabbing. Jay's
memo lists as one of the 10 problems of the job 'the members of the Creeps'
Club (ancient toadies and flatterers, whose combined intelligence and
courage would shame a rabbit) . . . (who) seek ceaselessly, in a brackish
tide of conspiracy, to ingratiate themselves, to excuse their incompetence
and to by-pass disciplined procedures by deploying their obsequious
machinations behind the scenes, especially at weekends.'
Maxwell's refusal to acknowledge any hierarchy also meant that when he
encountered opposition, particularly from his directors, he simply froze the
dissident out and welcomed someone else into the inner circle, regardless of
formal lines of authority.
Ernie Burrington, managing director of MGN, says: 'Maxwell bounced us (into
taking a new lease on MGN's headquarters). He did this by making Michael
Stoney (one of his 'fixers') deputy managing director with special
responsibilities for finance . . . jumping over the top of the Mirror
finance department.'
There was no half-way stage in Maxwell's favours. One of his favourite
expressions was: 'Trust is like virginity - you can only lose it once.'
One of his financial researchers says: 'You could see him just turn against
someone. The obsession that they were against him would grow and grow, no
matter what they'd done for him in the past.'
Maxwell's intolerance of opposition turned to paranoia. From 1988 on it led
to the secret tape-recording of conversations in his office and those of six
of his directors and executives. Even his sons were not immune.
The bugging was organised by Williams under his title of 'assistant to the
chairman', and then Pole, as head of security.
In 1988, Maxwell asked Williams to bug his private telephone, his office,
his dining room and his sitting room. Williams, a former policeman in
London's East End, used the help of a former army intelligence officer with
experience of undercover surveillance in Northern Ireland.
At first, simple tape recorders were used. But when Pole took over, Maxwell
gave approval for Pounds 40,000 to be spent on a sophisticated web of
sensors and wires which ran from the Mirror building in Fetter Lane to
Pole's office next door. Pole, a former CID detective superintendent who had
served with Scotland Yard's anti-terrorist branch, was assisted by Mike Ely,
another ex-policeman. They transcribed the tapes and read the transcripts to
Maxwell. Tapes and transcripts were then destroyed.
Many of the targets of Maxwell's suspicion eventually left. The exodus from
Maxwell House in the last two years of his empire included, crucially, four
of MCC's directors and several of those who opposed Maxwell most vigorously.
Pole says: 'In the end, Maxwell became extremely lonely. There was no one he
would really talk to. I found him one sunny Sunday afternoon on the roof of
Maxwell House. He had spent several hours sitting on the astroturf, drinking
tea. He was the architect of his own loneliness.'
Maxwell used frenetic activity to conceal what many people believe was a
gaping emptiness in his life. Order would have exposed it, as it would have
revealed the financial hole in his empire.
Why, then, did people work for him? Part of the answer is money. Most of his
senior executives and favourite aides received between Pounds 100,000 and
Pounds 200,000 a year.
That was often only part of the package. MCC executives would receive shares
in the company, which would typically be worth twice as much as their
salaries each year. Directors of 'arms-length' companies in which Maxwell
held only part of the shares, such as the London &amp; Bishopsgate investment
companies or MTV Europe, the pop music TV channel, had small stakes -
typically 5 per cent.
There were also generous bonuses. But for many, money was only part of the
answer. Maxwell had an eye for people who, like him, had a vacuum in their
lives. Burrington says: 'There had been a number of disappointments in my
life. He made things happen for me, as he did for others.'
Jay says: 'I had Maxwell's problem. I have a low threshold of boredom. I was
doing fiddling little jobs. I was in my mid 40s, late 40s. What this job
seemed to offer was activity, a proper job.'
Those who stayed longer than the typical six months in the court were
peculiarly susceptible to the romance and adventure of working for Maxwell.
It made them feel anything was possible.
Jay says: 'It was like a band of horsemen galloping across the steppes of
Russia who occasionally stopped in a huddle and saw what town they wanted to
take next, and then moved on.'
Maxwell gave these people a role. Several have described how they felt they
were competing to be the eighth Maxwell child; indeed, that they had
overtaken his older children in his affections. Pole remembers Maxwell
telling him 'that while it was good of me to visit my friends, it was
unacceptable for me to be unavailable for him. He talked to me like a
father.'
Sometimes they felt like his parent, tidying up the playpen. The disorder
flattered their abilities. Jay prided himself on bringing his efficiency to
the chaos of paperwork; treasurers and investment strategists, on bringing
their computer models to the chaos of cash.
For others, working for Maxwell offered an old-fashioned sort of patronage.
Williams says: 'Can you imagine a company like ICI allowing me to progress
like I did and paying for my Open University course?'
Jay is emphatic that he did not find the experience humiliating. 'It was a
free contract. The absurdity simply . . . made me laugh. Of course, if you
had had any personal pride involved it would have been intolerable . . . I
didn't let myself care about it. I wasn't about to let myself become
emotionally touched by it.' But Jay is clear that the job had little real
purpose. 'Anything I had any qualification for - he never asked my opinion.
He was visibly frightened of asking my view. I was not intellectually
engaged working for Maxwell.'
When Maxwell destroyed his empire he also destroyed many of the people in
it. They had become dependent on the money and the excitement, and have been
left with no money, no pension and an employment record that will make it
hard for them to find another job.
Some have been shattered by the experience. Bunn has been severely affected
by the emotional strain.
Cole, who describes himself as living on an emotional edge, is a visibly
shaken man. He says: 'I feel betrayed and I feel I've betrayed other people.
I took time away from my family, I lived day and night for Mr Maxwell for 12
years. I haven't had a holiday for 12 years, and it was all to help this. It
just mustn't happen again.'
The jigsaw of who signed which documents and why they did so in the theft of
Pounds 900m is only now being pieced together. It will take years of legal
action to establish the full pattern of knowledge and culpability. Maxwell's
bullying and his divide-and-rule policy partly explain how the fraud
happened. But it is also clear that the indulgence of some of his courtiers
allowed him to believe that he could get away with anything.

FT  15 JUN 92 / Rise and rise of the east Asian trading economies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN WOLF
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN A lecture last week on 'Europe in the 1990s: the Economic Perspective',
the Bank of England's chief economist, Professor Mervyn King, remarked that
'we must not become obsessed with the current conjunctural position to the
detriment of medium-term policies to raise economic growth, on the one hand,
and ensure price stability on the other'.
He was correct. Similarly, one should not allow short-term phenomena, such
as the collapse in Japanese asset prices and the slowdown in Japanese
growth, to obscure the world's most significant economic trend: the rise of
east Asia, with Japan in the lead.
The World Bank's recent publication on global economic prospects*, discussed
by Edward Balls in this column on April 27, shows that Japanese gross
domestic investment, at Dollars 910bn (Pounds 500bn) in 1989, exceeded that
of the US, then Dollars 878bn, and was little less than that of the EC, at
Dollars 1,023bn. This was in spite of the populations of both the US and the
EC being more than twice that of Japan. With 2 per cent of the world's
population, but a fifth of its investment, Japan's economy remains
formidable by any standards.
Such high rates of investment reflect the identification and exploitation of
profitable opportunities. Prominent among these has been
technology-intensive manufacturing. World trade in commodities that rely
heavily on expenditures on research and development, which is how the World
Bank defines technology-intensive production, soared from Dollars 25.3bn (21
per cent of global exports of manufactures) to Dollars 511.9bn (28.6 per
cent) between 1968 and 1988. Japan's exports rose faster still, its share
growing from 8.5 per cent to 17.5 per cent. By 1988 its high-technology
exports were only slightly less than those of the US, which, like Germany
and the UK, experienced a sharp decline in its share.
The most interesting policy aspect of Japanese success is the relative
absence of government support, not its high level, as so many allege. In the
US and UK, R&amp;D expenditures have been dominated by the needs of defence. In
Japan, by contrast, R&amp;D has been oriented towards market demand. Japan's
market-driven technology seems to have been far more economically successful
than the government-driven alternative.
Japan's success is no longer an isolated one. Over the same 20 years the
Republic of Korea moved from generating only 0.1 per cent of world exports
of high-technology manufactures to 2.9 per cent, nearly half the UK and
French levels. China's share jumped from 0.2 per cent to 1.1 per cent
between 1978 and 1988.
Such international trade achievements have made a crucial contribution to
the spectacular east Asian economic performance. The International Monetary
Fund's latest World Economic Outlook notes that between 1980 and 1981 alone,
China's real gross domestic product grew 2 1/2 times, while the combined
GDPs of Hong Kong, Indonesia, Korea, Malaysia, Singapore, Taiwan and
Thailand, all trade-oriented, more than doubled.
The World Bank shows total gross domestic investment in the region at
Dollars 1,233bn in 1989, three quarters of it in Japan, with the remainder
in its developing economies. This was virtually the same as in the whole of
Europe, both east and west, and significantly more than in North America.
With such high levels of investment and continued success in international
trade, the roughly 20 per cent of world GDP already accounted for by the
region is certain to rise further.
This year marks the celebration of the 500th anniversary of the European
discovery of America. Throughout most of that period the most dynamic parts
of the world have been Europe and its American offshoots. Prior to the 15th
century, however, east Asia, then dominated by China, was the world's most
economically advanced region. It is on its way to reclaiming that historic
place.

FT  15 JUN 92 / Indian bank reform accelerates after scandal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALEXANDER NICOLL, Asia Editor and REUTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW DELHI
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
INDIA'S financial market scandal is accelerating reform of the banking
system, although prospects for private-sector banking in the country have
been set back, according to Mr S. Venkitaramanan, governor of the Reserve
Bank of India.
In London on his way to a meeting of central bank heads, he said: 'I think
the process of reform of the financial system will, in fact, be speeded up
because the need for modernisation is becoming more obvious, as the recent
irregularities and scam indicate.'
The scandal, centring on short-term bank loans used to fund stock market
speculation, has led to resignations and arrests among some of the country's
top financiers, as well as known bank losses of about Pounds 600m. Banks
lent substantial sums on the basis of bankers' receipts, an instrument which
developed partly because of antiquated settlement methods for securities.
Mr Venkitaramanan said banks' settlement and internal inspection systems,
especially in treasury operations, funds management and foreign exchange
dealings, had to be modernised. Banks were working on setting internal
dealing limits and limiting off-balance sheet exposure.
Changes would be overseen by a new supervisory board to be set up under the
aegis of the Reserve Bank.
India is meanwhile pressing ahead with plans to put banks on a sounder
footing. They are chronically weak, as socialist central planning has forced
them to lend at below market rates to the government and officially
determined 'priority' sectors - chiefly state-owned entities and
agriculture.
Mr Venkitaramanan said interest rates for many borrowers had moved closer to
the market and he hoped that statutory liquidity ratios, the proportion of
banks' deposits pre-empted by the government to fund its budget deficit,
would come down further after being cut from 38.5 to 30 per cent.
This would still leave a large amount of small loans to farmers at rates
well below that of the market. It was proposed to establish a National Rural
Bank, along the lines of France's Credit Agricole, to ensure the flow of
lending to farmers but along more commercial lines.
After these reforms, many banks will need infusions of capital to meet
international standards. However, the government has ruled out privatisation
because of intense political opposition, particularly from unions.
Mr Venkitaramanan said the banking scandal had also ruled out, for the time
being, development of new private-sector Indian banks.
'Public opinion today would not welcome new private banks because of the
problems that have arisen.' Because of misuse of private banks by brokers,
'one has to pause a little to ensure that these banks are properly managed.'
Although problems had also arisen in state-owned and foreign banks, Mr
Venkitaramanan said that pushing ahead with development of private-sector
banking could jeopardise the whole reform process.
INDIA has frozen the assets of three bank officials allegedly involved in
the financial market scandal, Reuter reports from New Delhi.
The Finance Ministry said properties of the three officials of the State
Bank of India, including its deputy managing director, had been 'attached'.

FT  15 JUN 92 / The Earth Summit: Winners and losers
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Not many of the 103 world leaders who sat down at the Earth Summit managed
to leave Rio with all they hoped for. For some, the Earth Summit was a
dismal failure, with disappointingly few achievements and all its decisions
falling well short of the original goals. But in other ways, it was a
success - the first convocation of world leaders since the end of the cold
war and a forum for rigorous debate on policies which had never been
examined before. Among the winners and losers:
DETROIT: The US insistence on weakening the treaty to curb 'greenhouse
gases' takes pressure off gas-guzzling industries. Although attempts were
made to debate a carbon tax, this got lost in the wash. But Opec still
objects to measures in Agenda 21 intended to clean up the atmosphere.
WHITE HOUSE: the disastrous US handling of the summit cast it as the villain
from day one and led to Greenpeace denouncing President Bush as an
'environmental degenerate'. Which was a pity because the US's comments on
the issues showed it had thought many of them through much further than the
platitudinous majority of countries.
BRAZIL: The conference may have cost Brazil Dollars 37m (Pounds 20.3m) to
mount, but its virtually trouble-free organisation earned the host country
high praise, and as much as Dollars 100m in revenues from the 30,000 people
who attended.
EUROPEAN COMMISSION: Ripa di Meana's dramatic refusal to attend was quickly
forgotten, and Jacques Delors had to cancel both his speech and a press
conference to cadge a ride home on Concorde with President Mitterrand. A
supposed EC aid initiative of Ecu3bn (Pounds 2.1bn) was derided as an
accounting trick, showing Brussels still has no role to play at
inter-governmental conferences.
JAPAN: astute diplomacy made it a pacesetter on environmental issues, though
the new aid it put on the table of around Dollars 2.5bn was less than
expected. The only setback came when prime minister Miyazawa was unable to
attend, and was refused permission to address the summit by satellite link.
FORESTS: No binding measures at all to preserve tropical forests emerged
from the summit, even though this is one issue most people care about. The
Third World refused to cede its right to cut down trees for its livelihood,
and the industrial countries' threat to withhold aid money cut no ice.
WORLD BANK: was confirmed as the main channel for environmental finance for
the Third World, beating a rival bid by G77 countries to create a new Green
Fund. The Global Environment Facility, jointly administered by the Bank and
the UN, will be more than doubled in size (but see also Third World).
THIRD WORLD: The stinginess of aid pledges by the rich countries fell below
the most pessimistic forecasts. Even the UN summit organisers, who advocated
increased aid, conceded that poor countries would have to finance four
fifths of their environmental work themselves.
TELERJ: The Rio de Janeiro telephone company which hired out thousands of
portable telephones and thereby held the sprawling conference together,
cleaning up millions in the process.
NGOs: non-governmental organisations were supposed to be deeply involved in
the conference, providing technical support and influencing debate. But they
were shut out by the politicians, and spent most of their time at their
Global Forum 50km away, where they ran out of money and had their
electricity cut off.

MONEY proved to be one of the toughest nuts to crack at Rio, and the results
were disappointing. The industrial countries offered relatively little new
aid to clean up the Third World environment, citing budget stringency, and
were reluctant to commit themselves to large increases in the future.
The chunkiest contribution came from Japan which offered to raise its
environmental aid from Dollars 5bn (Pounds 2.7bn) over the last five years
to Dollars 7-Dollars 7.7bn over the next five.
No other country even came up with a firm figure for Overseas Development
Assistance (ODA). However several, including the UK, Germany and France,
offered to help refinance the Global Environment Facility (GEF), the fund
administered by the World Bank and the UN to help Third World countries
finance projects which help the global environment.
It now seems certain that the Dollars 1.3bn GEF will be more than doubled by
the end of next year.
There was also support for a replenishment of the International Development
Association, the World Bank facility for poorest countries.
The US focused its aid efforts on forestry, the one area for which it has
shown enthusiasm at Rio, with a contribution of Dollars 150m. The EC
attracted attention with a proposal for Ecu3bn (Pounds 2.1bn) of
environmental aid - until it transpired that this was merely the total which
had already been committed by member states.
The biggest battle came over attempts to get industrial countries to raise
their aid as a proportion of GNP to 0.7 per cent by the end of the century.
Only France (currently at 5.6 per cent) among the G7 was willing to make
this pledge.
The final conference text on finance was a wordy compromise which said that
developed countries would try to increase their ODA to 0.7 per cent to help
finance Agenda 21, and 'some countries agree or have agreed to reach the
target by the year 2000'.
Many other measures to aid Third World countries were discussed but their
financial value was not quantified. Overall, it is estimated that industrial
countries committed Dollars 2.5bn a year in new money, compared to the
Dollars 70bn the UN says is needed.
The Inter-American Development Bank will lend Mexico Dollars 100m towards a
Dollars 200m programme to reforest the country and clean up Mexico City's
air, Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari said in Rio.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTINA LAMB

<TEXT>
NO ISSUE divided north and south more intensely or highlighted the conflict
between environment and development more vividly than forests.
Considered by many ecologists to be among the world's most pressing
environmental problems, no commitment to halt deforestation resulted from
Rio - only 15 non-binding principles on management and conservation.
No-one seemed entirely happy with the outcome, which Mr Charles de Haes,
head of the World Wildlife Fund, called 'a bitter disappointment'. But after
marathon negotiations, which often seemed on the verge of complete
breakdown, there was general relief that something had been agreed, even
without a guarantee that the principles will halt or even slow the
deforestation of tropical forests, currently disappearing at a rate of 17m
hectares a year.
'The crucial thing is that for the first time we have laid the foundations
for global co-operation on forests,' said Mr Jag Maini, the Canadian
negotiator. 'Finally we'll be starting to define what is good forestry.'
Through the most tempestuous moments of the talks it was only the
persistence of Mr Klaus Topfer, the German environment minister, that saved
the day with intentionally ambiguous wording allowing face-saving on both
sides.
The single most contentious issue was over the preamble. Industrialised
nations wished it to contain a commitment to an enforceable future forest
convention.
In Rio it was India which was most vocal, refusing to sign anything which
even mentioned the word convention and insisting that the principles be
implemented first to see how they worked. As a compromise the final wording
leaves open the possibility by talking of 'appropriate internationally
agreed arrangements to promote international co-operation'.
The US caused another impasse with its refusal to accept the words 'right to
develop', claiming that this could have human rights implications. A
compromise was finally reached through the wording 'right to socio-economic
development on a sustainable basis'.
Sovereignty was another critical issue particularly for those countries with
large forests such as India, Malaysia, Indonesia and Brazil. India resisted
all language referring to the 'global' importance of forests, fearing
internationally imposed targets, as well as insisting on the pre-eminence of
national policies, partly because of its own community-based approach.
Finally this was resolved by stating that forests are 'essential to the
economy as a whole'.
Malaysia managed to include its 'greening of the world' concept which asks
all countries to make efforts towards afforestation.
The developing world also succeeded in a 'ban on bans' by outlawing
unilateral boycotts on 'unsustainable' forest products partly because this
goes against Gatt rules, and partly because of difficulties defining
sustainable forest products. However, the possibility is left open for
ecolabelling on goods within countries.
The Forestry Principles carry no legal commitment but as signed by heads of
state may carry a moral obligation. As a first attempt to set down some
worldwide 'Dos and Don'ts' of forestry they are not bad. Whether they will
help halt deforestation remains to be seen. 'Deforestation won't end until
people want trees more than they want land,' said a British official.

FT  15 JUN 92 / Adaptability of Nafta disputes procedure in doubt: Mexico's
legal system could hinder the introduction of a settlement process
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE US and Canada have resolved some of their thorniest trade rows with
maximum speed and minimum political fall-out through the disputes settlement
process of their free trade agreement (FTA).
The fact that many of the decisions have favoured Canada has been been one
of the Mulroney government's few weapons against his many FTA critics.
So successful is the settlement process that Mexico has made the inclusion
of a similar mechanism one of its key objectives in the creation of a North
American free trade area (Nafta).
There is concern, however, that the rules may not work as well if and when
they are grafted on to a legal system as different as Mexico's. These fears
range from Mexico's rudimentary standards of judicial investigation to the
ability of its Civil Law code to enforce a binding decision handed down by
an international tribunal. Administrative law governing the work of
government agencies is far less developed in Mexico than in the US or
Canada.
On a more practical level, there are doubts whether Mexico can muster a
sufficiently experienced pool of trade experts to serve on the binational
panels which are the cornerstone of the FTA system.
The US has a list of 50 people from which the panellists are drawn. Even the
Canadians have a pool only half as big.
A senior Canadian negotiator says both Washington and Ottawa still need to
be satisfied that the Mexican system can adapt. A US official is more
sanguine, however. 'All it needs is the will to make it work,' he says.
The FTA provides for two types of review procedure, known as Chapter 18 and
Chapter 19 panels.
In each case the panels consist of five members. Two are chosen by each
country, and the fifth by mutual agreement (sometimes simply by drawing a
name from a hat). The panellists themselves choose a chairman.
'Arguing before a panel, rather than a single judge, is more challenging and
more rewarding,' says Mr William Ince of the Washington legal firm Cameron &amp;
Hornbostel, who has appeared before about a dozen FTA panels.
Chapter 18 panels are used to adjudicate long-running, general disputes,
usually with strong political overtones. Short, fixed periods are set for
various stages of the process, with automatic triggers to discourage
delaying tactics by either government.
Chapter 19 panels have a narrower focus. They act in place of domestic
courts to review specific anti-dumping and countervailing duty complaints.
Again, time limits are set out for each stage of the process, with a maximum
of 315 days between the date of a request for a review and a panel's
decision.
The FTA also provides for an 'extraordinary challenge committee' comprising
three judges, as a last resort and a safeguard against impropriety or gross
error.
All but three of the two dozen or so disputes referred to binational panels
since the FTA came into force in 1989 have been adjudicated under Chapter
19. An extraordinary challenge committee has reviewed - and thrown out -
only one case, involving a US complaint against a panel finding on pork
imports from Canada.
The most recent Chapter 18 decision, handed down in the second week of June,
touched on the highly contentious subject of rules of origin for cars
assembled by Japanese-owned plants in Canada.
A North American content of 50 per cent is required for these vehicles to
qualify for duty-free access to the US, but Ottawa and Washington have
disagreed on which costs can be included in the calculation.
The panel unanimously supported Canada's argument that the Cami factory in
south-west Ontario, jointly owned by General Motors and Suzuki, can include
non-mortgage interest payments in calculating North American content.
Chapter 19 panels have dealt with products ranging from raspberries and
beer, to steel rails and induction motors.
Some have dealt with the same issue more than once. For instance, a Canadian
supplier of parts for road-paving equipment challenged the Department of
Commerce's implementation of a 1991 panel ruling which called on the
department to re-examine its calculation of a dumping margin. Another panel
recently demanded that the department reconsider some of the evidence within
the next two months.
The two governments are on the verge of implementing revised rules of
procedure for Chapter 19 panels.
One planned change which is likely to please the Mexicans, should they join,
is a requirement for a 'briefing' stage in the process, where parties must
provide panellists with full details of case law in their countries
pertaining to the issue being reviewed. Much of the panels' work is already
done through telephone conference calls.
Views differ on the wider contribution which the FTA mechanism may be making
to international trade. Prof Andreas Lowenfeld, of New York University's
School of Law, says that 'the notion that there is an FTA jurisprudence
developing is not quite right'.
But he adds that administrative agencies, such as the US International Trade
Commission, 'are seeing that they have to be more precise and less sloppy'.
Prof Lowenfeld says that the FTA panels generally examine arguments more
carefully than domestic US trade tribunals.
Mr Ince, on the other hand, observes that the binational reviews have
'regrettably' brought little improvement in the standard of investigations
by the US Commerce Department and the ITC.
'We have invoked the panel process in more than one case where adherence to
agency regulations or standard practice would have avoided the necessity for
an appeal,' he says.
Further articles in a series on Nafta will appear in the coming weeks.

FT  15 JUN 92 / Britain and China to hold HK airport talks: High-level
negotiations will attempt to break deadlock over financing plans
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
BRITAIN and China have agreed to high-level talks in an attempt to break the
deadlock over the financing plans for Hong Kong's new multi-billion dollar
airport.
Mr John Major, the British prime minister, and Mr Li Peng, his Chinese
counterpart, agreed in Rio de Janeiro over the weekend that the issue should
be pushed forward in talks between London and Beijing. Mr Alastair Goodlad,
a junior foreign office minister, is likely to lead the UK team when a time
and venue have been agreed.
Mr Major is understood to have impressed on Li the need for a speedy
resolution of differences between China and Britain.
The plan to build a new airport in Hong Kong has become a bellwether for
confidence in the colony's future. Doubts over its acceptability to the
Chinese last year caused a bout of damaging uncertainty and stock market
jitters; it took a visit to Beijing by Mr Major to obtain a go-ahead for the
project, subject to continuing consultation with China over its details. In
recent weeks, however, fresh doubts have been raised as to whether the
airport and its related projects can be started as soon as the Hong Kong
government would like, following apparent foot-dragging by Beijing.
The colonial government presented China with detailed plans for the
financing of the integrated road, rail and airport project at the beginning
of April. But the Chinese have called for more detail and have expressed
concerns over the escalation in the cost of the overall project as well as
individual parts of it.
Beijing appears particularly concerned over the level of possible debts on
the project the post-1997 government may inherit. These are currently
estimated to amount to more than HKDollars 20bn (Pounds 1.4bn) in the form
of undertakings to support the project if it runs into difficulties, known
as contingent liabilities. The Chinese also question the viability of a
planned railway which will link the airport to urban areas in Hong Kong.
These concerns have not been helped by the confusing way in which the local
administration has publicised the financial details of the project.
It started by releasing figures in real terms which estimated the cost at
HKDollars 114bn, then gave out 'money of the day' figures which showed the
cost at HKDollars 163.7bn. More recently it was revealed that if financing
charges and fees were included the cost would be HKDollars 175bn.
Further delays risk upsetting a very tight construction schedule and do
nothing for those charged with selling the project to private financiers.
The protracted nature of the negotiations has already begun to take its toll
on the colony's support for the project. Conservative members of Hong Kong's
local legislature have drawn up a plan to cut the cost of the airport
railway from HKDollars 22.3bn to HKDollars 18bn. Business leaders have also
criticised the government's handling of the negotiations.
There are also worries in some quarters that China may be delaying its
approval for financing of the airport as a way of pressuring Britain over
other aspects of policy, notably the pace of democratic reform in the colony
 -a subject raised by Mr Goodlad on a recent visit.
China's sensitivity over future political arrangements in the colony has
increased since the appointment of the first political governor of Hong
Kong, Mr Chris Patten.

FT  15 JUN 92 / Maastricht deal 'suffers from structural flaws'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BASLE
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FLAWS in the Maastricht Treaty increase the difficulties of moves towards
economic and monetary union, Mr Erik Hoffmeyer, chairman of the Committee of
European Community Central Bank Governors, warned yesterday.
Speaking to the Financial Times in Basle, where he is today to report to his
committee on the stalled plans for Emu, Mr Hoffmeyer said the treaty
suffered from 'structural weaknesses' relating to the economic aspects and
from a lack of clarity about the proposed political structure of a united
Europe.
The comments by Mr Hoffmeyer, who is also governor of Denmark's central
bank, increase uncertainty over Emu, plans for which were jeopardised by a
referendum of Danish voters earlier this month rejecting the treaty.
Mr Hoffmeyer, a firm Emu supporter, said he had not been embarrassed by the
vote of his fellow citizens. 'The debate in my country was fair and we have
to respect the decision,' he said, adding that he remained hopeful Europe
could 'get back into the game' of moving towards Emu. But exactly how to
achieve this was a matter for politicians.
The Danish bank chief, who will also take part in today's annual meeting in
Basle of the Bank for International Settlements, the central bankers' bank,
said the tough economic criteria agreed at Maastricht on the terms for
participation in Emu made it unlikely that the whole of Europe could join
the union at the same time.
The treaty also failed to address how wage and fiscal policy across Europe
would have to alter.
Third, the agreement had not been clear enough about the political framework
for a united Europe.
Mr Hoffmeyer said that his country had been wrong to vote against the
Maastricht treaty.
'The decision has retarded the development of a united Europe. I would wish
that my country was about to re-enter (the Emu debate).'

FT  15 JUN 92 / Hopes for relief flights depend on Serb ceasefire
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE WARRING sides in Bosnia-Hercegovina signed a new ceasefire agreement
yesterday, raising hopes that aircraft might be able to fly relief supplies
to the republic's besieged and starving capital, Sarajevo.
In New York, Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the United Nations secretary-general,
is today expected to advise the Security Council on whether Canadian troops
should be deployed to Sarajevo airport so relief flights can land there.
His decision depends on whether a ceasefire takes hold.
The truce is due to come into force at 6am today. The ceasefire agreement
was signed by Serb paramilitary forces and their opponents - who include not
only Moslems and Croats but also rival Serbs. With hostility running deep,
the opposing sides signed separately in the UN peacekeeping forces'
headquarters in Sarajevo.
A unilateral ceasefire had already been foreshadowed last Friday by Mr
Radovan Karadzic, head of the Serb irregulars who have blockaded the airport
and bombarded the city since early April. They are opposed to the republic's
proclaimed independence from the Yugoslav federation.
Pressure has mounted on Serbs to end the war since the UN imposed sanctions
on Serbia and its ally, Montenegro, two weeks ago.
In the latest sign of discontent among Serbs, Patriarch Pavle of the Serbian
Orthodox Church led thousands of people on a peace march through Belgrade
yesterday. Thousands more gathered at the Yugoslav parliament to demand that
Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic resign.
Over the weekend, General Lewis Mackenzie, head of the UN mission in
Sarajevo, reached an agreement with the Bosnian presidency, and Mr Karadzic,
to exchange liaison officers with all sides. The officers will try to
monitor the demilitarisation of the airport.
French airport security technicians, who are already in Sarajevo, were due
to go to the airport yesterday to supervise the process of de-militarising
it and the surrounding areas. Once this is achieved, Mr Boutros Ghali will
recommend to the Security Council whether to send 1,000 Canadian troops
already deployed in Croatia as part of the UN peacekeeping operation there.
Sarajevo radio yesterday reported a lull in the fighting, but said snipers
had repeatedly fired on engineers who had been trying to restore the water
supply after the city's generators were bombed. It said 17 people were
killed in fighting at the weekend.
The war in Bosnia will be discussed in Luxembourg today by European
Community foreign ministers, Portuguese officials said yesterday.
They said the future status of Macedonia, Croatia's involvement in Bosnia,
and the potential threat of war spreading to the Serb-controlled southern
province of Kosovo - where tension between ethnic Albanians and Serb police
rose sharply yesterday after a Serb soldier was killed - would also be on
the agenda.

   RIO DE JANEIRO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
WORLD LEADERS at the Earth Summit failed to grasp the challenge to save the
global environment, Mr Maurice Strong, the summit organiser, said yesterday
on the summit's last day.
'We're on a course that is leading to tragedy and as we leave Rio we have
not satisfied that concern,' he said as 103 world leaders left Rio de
Janeiro at the end of the 12-day gathering.
Mr Strong said he was particularly disappointed with the lack of substantial
financial commitments by the developed world to help the Third World
overcome its environmental problems. 'I would have like to have seen solid
commitments but for the most part leaders have made broad policy statements.
I strongly urge them to translate these into concrete commitments.
'I say with the strongest possible passion that we must change.' However, he
added: 'We simply cannot save the world in a one-shot quick fix conference.'
In the last hours of the summit, several industrial countries, including the
UK, Germany, Japan and the US, refused to commit themselves to a large
increase in aid by the end of the century. An attempt to win their support
for an increase in aid to the equivalent of 0.7 per cent of GNP by the year
2000 - the official United Nations target - was watered down in a conference
document to 'as soon as possible'. Only France, among the G7 industrial
countries, agreed to the proposed target.
All the conference documents were agreed in time for the close, although the
US refused to sign a legally-binding treaty on biological diversity - or
species protection. The US was the only important industrialised nation not
to sign. More than than 150 countries signed treaties on both biodiversity
and climate change.
Other documents agreed included a statement of principles on forests, the
Rio Declaration of environmental principles, and the Agenda 21 action plan.
Although these were agreed only after tortuous, at times bitter, struggles,
they all fell short of their original goals.
Mr Strong estimated the total new resources pledged in Rio as Dollars
6bn-Dollars 7bn (Pounds 3.2bn-Pounds 3.8bn) but said: 'I believe frankly
we're not going to get the kind of finance we need without some innovative
mechanisms such as tradeable emissions permits.'

FT  15 JUN 92 / Early intelligence files implicated Robert Maxwell
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS, ROBERT PESTON and IVO DAWNAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UK GOVERNMENT had intelligence information years before the collapse of
Mr Robert Maxwell's empire that suggested the late publisher was acting
dishonestly.
Mr Maxwell was not seen as a risk to national security and was therefore not
an 'intelligence target' as such.
But it is understood that information pointing to his questionable
activities existed within the files of the security services from Mr
Maxwell's early days as a businessman.
The Financial Times has also learnt that a full intelligence report was
prepared for the Joint Intelligence Committee (JIC) at the time of Mr
Maxwell's death off Gran Canaria on November 5 last year. The JIC, which is
part of the Cabinet Office, co-ordinates and assesses information from
Britain's intelligence services, including MI5 and MI6.
Separately, a former JIC official has claimed that some data on Mr Maxwell's
more recent activities, gathered by the intelligence services from
intercepted telephone conversations and faxes, were passed to the Bank of
England in 1989.
The Bank is understood to have carried out an intensive search last week and
can find no such information on its files. Its officials have no
recollection of receiving such information.
Mr Robin Robison, who worked as an administrative officer for the JIC,
claims that other major British and foreign companies, largely but not
exclusively in the defence field, routinely have had their telephone and
telex communications intercepted.
The companies under surveillance, he says, included GEC Marconi, Lonrho,
Rolls-Royce, and their foreign competitors, and General Motors of the US.
Mr Robison, whose job involved sorting signals intelligence from the
Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) in Cheltenham, the centre
which intercepts international communications, claims in a statement that,
while working for the JIC, he sorted raw intelligence on Mr Maxwell.
'The sigint (signals intelligence) I saw in the autumn of 1989 included
intelligence data on Robert Maxwell taken from telephone conversations and
faxes intercepted in Israel and the Mediterranean, probably from his yacht
the Lady Ghislaine.'
The information, according to Mr Robison, centred on Mr Maxwell's businesses
and his overseas trips although he cannot recall what the reports said in
detail. He says the information was evaluated and distributed to top
Whitehall officials including the prime minister's office and cabinet
ministers.
Mr Robison, who resigned from the JIC at the end of 1989, says he sent some
GCHQ data on Mr Maxwell to an economic subsection of the committee which
included a seconded Bank of England official and others.
Classified intelligence material about Mr Maxwell protected by code words
was also sent regularly in a van to another official at the Bank's City
headquarters in Threadneedle Street, he says. The middle ranking official
named in Mr Robison's statement is understood to act as a post-box within
the bank for sensitive information. The official receives confidential
documents and passes them to Bank departments which may have an interest in
the contents.
In normal circumstances, the Bank would not expect to receive any
information on Mr Maxwell, since the late publisher did not own any
businesses regulated by the Bank.
If it had received such information, it would have been passed to the
industrial finance department under Mr Pen Kent or the banking supervision
section under Mr Brian Quinn, directors of the Bank. Neither department has
been able to find any record of receiving such information.
The Bank is known to have received information passed to it by the
intelligence services about the activities of the failed Bank of Credit and
Commerce International and its links with international terrorists.
Mr Maxwell, who was born in Czechoslovakia, had high-level contacts with
several former communist leaders. There are also suggestions that he was
under surveillance by the Czech secret services.
Mr Robison, a Quaker, resigned from the JIC over what he believed was the
increasing unaccountability of intelligence gathering and the potential for
the misuse of power.
Mr John Major, the prime minister, has declared himself in favour of more
open government. He has appointed Mr William Waldegrave as minister for
'open government', and recent-ly broke with Whitehall tradition by publicly
naming the heads of MI5 and SIS (MI6). Ivo Dawnay writes: The Cabinet Office
refused to comment on the claims, insisting Mr Robison was a 'very junior
administrations officer' who had worked on the JIC for a relatively short
period. But it did not deny such information might have been collated. 'This
refers to intercepts which obviously are part of intelligence systems,' an
official said. 'We never comment on those for security reasons.'
Labour party trade and industry spokesman Gordon Brown last night called for
a full statement from Mr Major. 'If government ministers knew of
irregularities in the Maxwell empire as early as 1989 then we now need a top
level inquiry and a full prime ministerial statement explaining why no
action was taken to investigate fraud.'

FT  15 JUN 92 / Ireland's anti-Maastricht campaigners out in force
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MASS, not Maastricht, was delivered from pulpits across Ireland yesterday.
In churches throughout Dublin, the feast of the Holy Trinity was celebrated,
communion taken and coins placed in collection baskets for the Catholic
Youth Council in response to an appeal from the Archbishop of Dublin. It is
increasingly difficult 'to be young, Irish and Catholic' he said in a
message read in churches throughout the city. Maastricht was not mentioned.
Only at the entrance of the churches, next to noticeboards, the parish
newspapers and the holy water, were copies of the bishops' ambivalent
statement on Maastricht displayed. Most mass-goers appeared to ignore it as
they filed out, as if they had already decided how to vote in Thursday's
referendum.
Less easy to ignore, and far less ambivalent, were the anti-Maastricht
campaigners outside. 'Seven reasons why you should vote No' said the
leaflets they pressed into hands fresh from prayer. Most churches in the
city were similarly staked out.
The No campaign was out in force. One teenager, sporting prominent 'Vote No'
stickers on her blouse, was leafleting on Dublin's beaches at the weekend.
'If you vote Yes, the Maastricht treaty means that abortion will be
introduced in Ireland,' she explained as she handed out 'Pro-Life' leaflets
to half-naked sunbathers. 'What's abortion, mummy?' asked a child with an
ice cream in one hand and a leaflet in the other. 'Give that to me,' said
the embarrassed mother. 'What's Mass-tricked then?' he persisted.
Many Irish people have been asking the same question in the past few weeks.
Confusion is rampant. For some it means Ireland will be wealthier, but women
will have fewer rights because of the special Irish protocol in the treaty,
respecting Ireland's anti-abortion legislation. For others it means Ireland
will be poorer, but women will have more rights because EC law and not Irish
law will prevail.
The government insists Irish neutrality will not be compromised. Articulate
opponents insist that it will. Most people don't know who to believe. A
friend said: 'I'm inclined to vote Yes, but some of the implications are so
unclear I might vote No to be on the safe side'.
A school teacher said he will vote against the treaty because he feared that
the Brussels bureaucracy would become too powerful, and that wealthier
states would benefit more than the poorer ones like Ireland. Another friend,
separated from her husband but unable to divorce because of Ireland's laws
said: 'I am voting Yes because it scares me to be left behind with these
people who want to keep us in the last century.'
Whatever the viewpoint, most are convinced that the opposing camp will win.
The last three opinion polls all indicate a two-to-one margin in favour of
the treaty, although the 'undecided' still account for some 30 per cent of
voters, and most people prefer to believe their own ears rather than the
polls.
The school teacher is convinced the treaty will be approved because the
government and main political parties have all thrown their weight behind
the Yes campaign. 'They have all the resources to get their message across,
while the alternative viewpoint is not getting heard,' he said.
Maybe, but willing bodies to do the canvassing appear to be lacking.
According to Mr Bertie Ahern, the finance minister, the main political
parties were to have launched an all-out effort to put the Yes message
across this weekend. Instead, it was the No campaigners standing at the
church gates, tramping the beaches, knocking on doors and pasting up
posters. The government leaflet, recommending a Yes vote, was delivered last
week in the post.

FT  15 JUN 92 / EC budget talks lead to fears over Irish union vote
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPEAN Community foreign ministers will today discuss new EC budget
proposals that could disappoint Irish voters just days before a national
referendum on the Maastricht treaty on European union.
A majority of finance ministers last week came out against a package of
spending increases put forward by Mr Jacques Delors, the Commission
president. His plan for a 30 per cent increase in the EC budget over five
years would benefit poorer countries in the EC, including Ireland, through
larger contributions from richer member states. However, the Portuguese
presidency is now proposing a compromise under which the budget would rise
by the same amount but possibly spread over a longer period, following
opposition from richer member states.
The Irish government will be concerned that any display of rich country
stinginess today might affect the result of its referendum on Maastricht on
Thursday. Recent Irish opinion polls show a slide in pro-EC opinion, though
still with a majority in favour of Maastricht. If Irish voters were to
follow the Danes, who rejected it two weeks ago, the treaty on EC political
and monetary union would be effectively dead.
The Delors plan envisaged a steady rise in spending by a third from next
year to Ecu88bn in 1997. The Portuguese presidency is proposing either
limiting the increase in the first couple of years, or spreading the whole
30 per cent rise beyond 1997.
Dublin's worries are shared by others, including Mr Delors, who told Irish
journalists last week that Ireland could count on continued large cash
benefits from the Community. But Mr Delors has represented his 1993-97
spending plan as 'the bill for Maastricht'. To get the treaty ratified in
richer countries, Delors and the Portuguese presidency, have to accommodate
the desire of richer states to minimise this bill.
Mr Delors has a delicate path to tread, with one false step jeopardising not
only the Maastricht treaty, but also his chances of being re-nominated by EC
leaders at the Lisbon summit in 10 days' time for a further two-year term as
Commission president. At present, he has no rival for the job.
In its paper outlining options for an outline accord at the Lisbon summit on
future EC financing, Portugal suggests that the overall spending rise might
be 'moderated in the initial phase' to suit richer countries which will be
paying in more than they get out of the EC budget. But the poorer countries
 -Spain, Ireland, Greece and Portugal  - would still get 'a linear increase'
in aid from Brussels.
Portugal tentatively hints that the cuts in the Delors plan should come in
spending on EC internal policies, though not in the new scheme for
trans-European transport networks that might especially benefit the
Community's poorer periphery, and on EC external policies.

FT  15 JUN 92 / Justinian: Press is living dangerously
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUIS BLOM-COOPER QC
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Once again the public has been displaying its perennial ambivalence to its
daily fare of newspaper reading. The media coverage of the marriage of the
Prince and Princess of Wales has by all accounts been a huge commercial
success. At the same time the coverage has produced a barrage of public
criticism, led by the forthright statement from the Press Complaints
Commission. It may be that those who avidly read the revelations of royal
disharmony are not the same persons who express outrage at such press
outpourings; but the suspicion is that we all speak with two voices.
The public outcry at the media reporting is clearly propelling government
towards the introduction of a privacy law. If so, the need for some clear
thinking about what constitutes an invasion of private life - and in
particular the reporting on royalty - is acute.
Any privacy law must initially determine whether invasion of privacy has
taken place. What does 'private life' mean? Does it include a person's home
address? What about the sexual proclivities, not to say activities, of an
individual? Is the drug addiction of one member of a family a matter which
touches the privacy of other family members?
The Calcutt Committee in its report of June 1990 discussed the meaning of
privacy. Its conclusion was that privacy could be defined as 'the right of
an individual to be protected against intrusion into his personal life or
affairs, or those of his family, by direct physical means or by publication
of information'. It went on to note that the right to privacy 'could
include' protection against physical intrusion; publication of hurtful or
embarrassing personal material (whether true or false); publication of
inaccurate or misleading personal material; and publication of photographs
or recordings of the individual taken without consent. The Press Complaint
Commission's Code of Practice does not reflect these categories; unless the
Code is speedily amended the message will go out to politicians that the
press is unwilling to regulate itself.
Once through the threshold issue the next question is whether there has been
an intrusion or inquiry into or publication relating to the private sphere.
If the answer is yes, one then faces the difficult hurdle of the public
interest defence.
An immediate question is: would any of this protective cloak against
unwanted personal publicity be thrown over the royal family. There is a
general view that those who are engaged in public affairs lose some, if not
all, of their privacy. A politician is expected publicly to uphold the moral
values of society and to the extent that his/her private life discloses
double standards it is disclosable to the public via a vigilant press.
But if politicians and others choose the public arena as their occupation
they cannot complain if the law should treat them less sensitively than
those who wish to pursue their lives away from the public domain. The
trouble about applying these principles to the royal family is that its
members do not choose to live their lives publicly. They perform publicly as
a matter of public duty. At least all that is true of those members of the
royal family who are somewhat distanced from the throne. The constitutional
position of the Queen and Prince Charles may thrust all their working days
into the public domain.
The Press Complaints Commission has tacitly acknowledged that some members
of the royal family are entitled to protection of their privacy. The
adjudication last August in the matter of Princess Eugenie is a case in
point. The Commission held that the People newspaper's publication of nude
photographs of the infant princess was an invasion of privacy. In response
to the People's defence that the photographs were 'charming' and 'natural',
the Commission brushed aside such claims as irrelevant because the
photographs were simply an invasion of privacy.
Stripped of the circumstances that led the Press Complaints Commission to
pronounce so precipitately on the stories of the Prince and Princess of
Wales, the Commission nevertheless did shed some light on the issue of
public interest. It conceded the existence of a legitimate public interest
in the situation of the heir to the throne. Noting that the state of the
royal marriage was already in the public domain, by virtue of the 'outward
behaviour of the spouses', the Commission nevertheless expressed the opinion
that the manner and tone of the reporting was a breach of the Code of
Practice. The implication of that statement is that even a finding of
'public interest' will not necessarily justify intrusive and speculative
treatment of a story which the Commission described as 'dabbling
journalistic fingers in the stuff of other people's souls in a manner which
adds nothing to the discussion of the matter of public interest'.
Just before the Press Council was disbanded at the end of 1990, it planned
to hold a seminar to discuss the problems of a free and responsible press in
reporting on the royal family. Such a dialogue now needs to be undertaken
urgently, whether or not moves to introduce a privacy law for the rest of us
comes about.

FT  15 JUN 92 / Cloudy view from San Francisco
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Travelling in the US brings home the vastness of the country. While on the
west coast last week, I went to see Mr Robert Parry, president of the
Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco.
Mr Parry is one of a dozen regional Fed presidents, yet runs an empire that
is larger than that of most European central bank governors. It includes
California (which has a larger gross domestic product than all but seven
nations), the western states of Alaska, Arizona, Idaho, Nevada, Oregon and
Washington, and Hawaii and assorted islands in the Pacific. In Europe a
comparable empire might include Britain, Ireland, northern France, Belgium
and the Canary Islands - as a quid pro quo for Hawaii.
How, from this western perch, does Mr Parry see the US economy evolving? His
own district has yet to show definite signs of recovery mainly because of
the drag from California, which is floundering in its worst recession since
the 1930s. Hit especially hard by defence cuts and sagging commercial real
estate markets, the state has lost more than 600,000 jobs (about 4 per cent
of the total). Mr Parry believes California hit bottom at the end of last
year, is now moving sideways and will probably recover later in the year.
Others are more pessimistic, expecting recovery to be postponed to next year
or even 1994.
Nationally, economic statistics are again raising doubts about the
recovery's momentum. I talked with Mr Parry after the release of the May
employment report, which showed unemployment rising sharply to 7.5 per cent
(8.7 per cent in California) but before Thursday's unexpectedly poor retail
sales figures. Optimistic by nature, Mr Parry happily refers to the national
recession in the past tense. 'It lasted two quarters and was over more than
a year ago,' he declares. He believes the economy is poised to break out of
its lengthy slowdown and forecasts growth of close to 3 per cent in the
coming year.
Weak figures for sales, jobs, housing and the money supply, however, are
prompting renewed speculation on Wall Street that the Fed may nudge interest
rates lower again, in spite of its reported shift to a neutral monetary
stance. Can Mr Parry shed any light on the debate?
Choosing his words with care, he says the effects of recent interest rate
cuts are still working their way through the economy. He is 'comfortable'
with the current policy stance because he believes it to be consistent with
moderate economic growth and further progress in reducing inflation.
Reluctant to specify the conditions that would warrant another easing of
policy, he suggests that the Fed's decision last autumn to resume interest
rate cuts set a clear precedent. The implication is that rates could fall
again, but only if a consistent run of weak figures indicates the economy is
sagging into a 'triple dip.'
The silver lining in the long slowdown is a steady decline in inflation.
Friday's consumer prices report confirmed that the underlying rate is now
much closer to 3 per cent than the 5 per cent that seemed entrenched during
the 1980s. Why then are long bond yields still so high?
Mr Parry, an economist by training, blames the Fed's own past failures to
restrain inflation in economic upturns. 'Financial markets don't believe the
Fed will be successful in orchestrating the long-term decline in inflation
I'm predicting. Otherwise the current real rates of interest wouldn't be
needed.' Onerous long-term rates are thus partly an unavoidable price for
past policy mistakes.
Economists at the San Francisco Fed suggest two reasons for macroeconomic
caution in coming months. The first is that the growth slowdown of the past
three years is partly attributable to demographic changes that have caused
the labour force to grow more slowly than in the 1980s. Adjusting for this
supply-side change, the recession has been milder than most previous
downturns. People should not be surprised, therefore, if the recovery is
also weak by past standards.
Perhaps more important, the very diversity of the San Francisco district
makes the bank's economists aware of the limitations of national monetary
policy.
In employment terms, California is experiencing a more severe recession than
that of any region except New England and the mid-Atlantic states. But
California is a huge state: Los Angeles and surrounding counties account for
80 per cent of its job losses; most of northern California is faring no
worse than the nation as a whole. All the other eight states in Mr Parry's
district have enjoyed net job growth since the beginning of the US recession
in July 1990. Star performers such as Utah and Idaho have seen employment
surge by 5 per cent or more.
Mr Parry may sometimes wish he had the power of a European central bank
governor. But if he had his own discount rate, it would still be impossible
to meet the needs of both Los Angeles and the mountain states. Indeed, it
would be wrong to interfere with a rational economic adjustment under way: a
transfer of investment and jobs from overpriced, overpopulated coastal
regions to the cheap, empty interior.

FT  15 JUN 92 / Foreign Exchanges and Money Markets: Focus on Irish vote
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ireland's referendum on European union, which takes place on Thursday, is
certain to dominate the attention of the foreign exchange markets this week,
writes James Blitz.
Trading in European currencies has been more volatile than usual in the
fortnight since the Danes voted 'No' to the Maastricht treaty. Dealers
believe that the growing troubles over the treaty make the D-Mark a more
attractive currency in which to invest, because it is seen as the anchor of
the European Monetary System.
There may be more D-Mark buying in the run-up to the vote. If, against
expectations, dealers wake up on Friday and find that the Irish have voted
Maastricht down, several currencies will pay a heavy price. Among the most
vulnerable are the Italian lira, the Spanish peseta and sterling.
Dollar trading will continue the uncertain tone of recent days as the
markets remain unsure about the scale of the US economic recovery. Last
week's poor retail sales figures for May, showing a 0.2 per cent rise when
0.7 per cent was expected, will continue to hang over the market. The US
trade figures for April, due out on Thursday, may influence sentiment: the
market expects the March deficit of Dollars 5.8bn to narrow.
The market may be too bearish about the US overall. 'There is a
contradiction between the market's sentiment and fundamental analysis of the
US economic figures,' says Mr Chris Dunis of Chemical Bank. 'Underlying
everything, there has been an increase in demand met by de-stocking in the
first quarter.'
Sterling holders face a busy week of statistics. First quarter balance of
payments are due out today and industrial production on Wednesday.

   THERE IS A NEW buzzword in official economic policy
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
credibility. It operates in rather an odd way. If we can establish
sufficient credibility for our commitment to the ERM, we are told, we could
cut interest rates; and indeed, the further sterling might temporarily sink
below its central ERM rate, the further we could cut them, because of the
unshakeable belief that it would appreciate to its central rate on the way
to EMU.
But first, we have to get round an awkward corner: in order to establish
credibility in the first place we have had to raise rates. We and the French
decided this in effect, as Dr Mervyn King explained in Rome, when we decided
that a German revaluation, which they wanted, would so damage the
credibility of the franc and the pound that we would rather stick to a tight
German policy. In time, the market would understand that because the
problems were German, we could ease domestic policy.
If you think this strategy of reculer pour mieux sauter itself strains
credibility, then read the whole text of King's speech.
The logic is clear enough, and the French experience with the franc fort,
not to mention our own rate cuts since joining the ERM, go a good deal of
the way to proving that it can work.
It would work a good deal more readily, as an IMF staff paper argued many
years ago, if we pitched our ERM commitment not in terms of a spot rate, but
of a forward rate - say, three months forward; for arbitrage ensures that a
cut in interest rates drives up the forward rate relative to the spot rate.
It is theoretically possible then, to combine an unbreakable exchange rate
commitment with some independence in monetary policy.
However, there is a missing term in the argument: it begs the question of
what is a credible exchange rate in the first place.
The official side seems to believe that it depends purely on the tightness
with which ministers clench their teeth. Many market traders, however,
continue to demand other evidence, notable a sound current account balance.
These people continue to believe, in defiance of the current phase in
official doctrine, that a country which depends on large injections of
foreign capital simply to prevent a bad slump getting even worse is not in a
sustainable position. The longer the slump lasts, and the current account
remains weak (and they will guess at the balance even when the official
figures disappear for a spell), the more they will believe that something
has to give.
That conventional point of view still commands its own credibility, and even
traders who disagree with it must take it into account as an influence in
the market. Indeed, even the Treasury is in the practice of taking it into
account: the Whitehall panic over public spending must make perfect sense to
Lord Healey, who had similar problems when the balance of payments was weak
in the mid-1970s. It does not, however, square with the official doctrine
that large deficits are a natural and even desirable reflection of a deep
recession - which also makes perfectly good sense.
There is one hopeful side to the Healey parallel. The UK current deficit in
the mid-1970s reflected a huge burst of foreign investment in the North Sea,
whose results in due course pushed the current account into large surplus;
and it can be argued that the rapid growth of Japanese car-making capacity
is having the same result, with the same promise for the future. The trouble
is that this is not the kind of analysis which normally impresses traders
responding to bad figures.
And now we have the Danes, who have dented the credibility not only of
Maastricht, but of the whole ERM-EMU project which has made our own exchange
rate commitment more credible.
Small wonder Mr John Major is so strongly commited to sustaining what he can
of Maastricht. He may succeed, just as Mr Michael Portillo may get the
government's part of our national deficit under control; but it is all much
harder than clenching your teeth. Fingernails will be worn short in Great
George Street this year.

FT  15 JUN 92 / International Bonds: New regime likely to raise cost of
doing business
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LAST WEEK's agreement between European governments on common capital
standards for the securities industry contained several concessions which
pleased Eurobond firms.
However, on even the most optimistic interpretations, Eurobond underwriters
are likely to find the cost of doing business higher under the new
regulatory regime.
If the detail of the Capital Adequacy Directive (CAD) contains any nasty
shocks - which is still a possibility, since last week's agreement covered
only general tenets - the primary Eurobond market could be significantly
changed in character.
Most areas of the London-based bond and equity markets welcomed the
compromise agreed by government officials early on Wednesday morning. It is
clear the UK Treasury achieved its primary strategic goal: to protect
London's small specialist securities houses against larger continental
European universal banks.
For Eurobond underwriters, the most important change is that the 'window'
allowed to new issue underwriters before full capital requirements start to
bite has been set at 10 days. Earlier drafts stipulated only a five-day
window.
However, a survey conducted earlier this year for the International Primary
Markets Association, which represents the big new issue underwriters, found
that a 'material balance' of most Eurobond issues remains unsold even 10
days after launch.
How much underwriters of slow-moving Eurobond issues will be penalised
depends on the formula governing how fast and how hard capital requirements
start to bite once the underwriting window closes. But the capital cost of
underwriting a bad new issue is likely to be higher than under current
regulations set by the UK Securities and Futures Authority.
One implication could be that firms will be less willing to underwrite new
issues which are likely to sell slowly.
But it could also lead firms to demand higher fees to underwrite bond issues
aimed at retail investors - which by nature take longer to distribute. This
could increase the cost of funds for issuers of retail-targeted bonds.
The Eurobond lobby failed to win greater allowances for hedging activities
of new issue underwriters: for example, where a firm limits market risk by
using derivative financial instruments or by taking matching short
positions.
The directive will certainly recognise hedging activity overall. One of the
advantages of the complex 'building block' approach to market risk which
underpins the CAD is that hedged positions can be recognised.
However, the directive will not make full allowances for hedging during the
underwriting process. There will be no lower capital requirements for hedged
underwriting positions. In May, IPMA identified this as a fundamental flaw.
Indeed, several firms surveyed by IPMA said 'they would be unwilling to
continue underwriting activity in Europe unless the CAD were amended to make
proper allowances for hedging, particularly the hedging of interest rate
risk on debt securities'.
EC officials said last week that there was no prospect of change on this
point. It remains to be seen whether firms really are prepared to carry out
the threat to stop underwriting.
One notable area of success was an agreement that all securities borrowing
or repurchase agreements should fall under the CAD, rather than tougher
banking regulations.
Under earlier drafts of the directive, stock borrowed from institutions not
themselves regulated at an EC level - including pension funds and companies
 -would count as loans rather than trading positions. This would entail
higher capital requirements and increased cost of securities borrowing,
damaging the liquidity of the market.
The agreement reached last week should safeguard stock borrowing and 'repo'
in the Euromarket, which has sharply increased over the past two years.
These points aside, bond market participants noted that implementation of
the CAD will be linked to agreement on the Investment Services Directive,
which could be months - or years - away.
While the CAD lays down a system for prudential regulation of the securities
industry, the ISD aims to give banks and firms a single passport to operate
in all EC centres and lay down rules for the conduct of business. Capital
adequacy rules are only a safety net for the broader aim of a single
European market for securities business.
While the CAD could disturb the equilibrium of the Eurobond market, the
Investment Services Directive could legislate it out of existence.
The latest drafts of the ISD contain a clause which would restrict trading
of securities to 'regulated markets'. The Eurobond market would not qualify
as a regulated market, not least because it has no formal listing or
reporting requirements for issuers.
The idea is vigorously rejected by the UK government, which is keen to
protect the London-based status quo. It has a powerful ally in the European
Commission.
Against this, several European governments including France, Spain and
Italy, are pressing for tougher regulation in the guise of investor
protection.
It remains unclear whether the deadlock will now be broken.
On an optimistic note, there is a broad sense in which the evolving system
of European regulation should work to the advantage of all securities
markets.
The capital rules governing holdings of securities look likely to be less
stringent than those applying to loans.
Last week, however, no Eurobond market participants were uncorking champagne
in honour of the CAD. Market participants recognised there will be hard
bargaining and horse-trading before the package of European securities
industry regulation is agreed.

FT  15 JUN 92 / Government Bonds: Switch into D-Mark safe haven continues
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SPANISH and Italian government bonds slid further last week as dealers and
investors continued to switch out of high-yielding markets and into the
relative safety of the D-Mark bloc in the aftermath of Denmark's rejection
of the Maastricht Treaty on June 2.
The markets will be watching the outcome of the Irish referendum on June 18,
where the result is expected to be a vote in favour of the treaty.
However, the Danish vote against the treaty has forced investors to examine
the merits of individual bond markets more carefully now that interest rate
convergence has been placed - perhaps temporarily - on ice.
In the case of Italy and Spain, dealers and investors are now far more
concerned about the domestic economic problems.
Italy is suffering from political uncertainty in addition to its economic
woes - namely a large budget deficit and high level of public debt - and
short-term interest rates have been forced up since the Danish referendum to
support the currency.
Market participants are still worried about the prospect of higher interest
rates if the lira continues to come under pressure in the immediate future.
The Spanish government bond market was dealt a severe blow after the Danish
referendum, and fell back further on Friday following the release of
worse-than-expected inflation figures.
Inflation rose 0.3 per cent in May (leaving the year-on-year rate unchanged
at 6.5 per cent), whereas economists had hoped to see an increase of only
0.1 per cent.
The two markets which have gained the most from the Maastricht blues are
Germany and the Netherlands, with the latter seen as having a more
favourable inflation outlook as well as having nearly completed its funding
programme for the year.
The yield on the 8 per cent bund due 2002 fell to 7.91 per cent by the end
of last week, from 7.95 per cent a week before.
In the Dutch market, the yield on the 10 -year Dutch government bond has
fallen from 8.32 per cent to 8.27 per cent in the same period, and dealers
have noted strong buying interest in the 15-year issue - especially given
that Germany lacks a similarly dated bond.

FT  15 JUN 92 / US Money and Credit: Hopes rise of cut in interest rates by
Fed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HOPES that the Federal Reserve might ease short-term interest rates once
more in this economic cycle are on the rise again following a batch of
ostensibly helpful statistics.
Yet a strong case can still be made for the Fed keeping its monetary policy
on hold, at least until early July, just before the presidential election
campaign gets under way in earnest.
Those arguing in favour of easing maintain the slow recovery in the economy
remains too fragile for comfort and that a further cut in short-term rates
will help to ensure that the revival is sustainable.
Some support for this line came from last week's statistics. Robust consumer
spending is vital for the recovery yet retail sales showed a tiny two-tenths
of 1 per cent gain in May, while April's figures, originally reported as a
robust 0.9 per cent, were revised down to 0.4 per cent. This was
substantially below analysts' expectations.
However, the weather across the US was atrocious during these two months.
And car sales have been relatively healthy over the past few weeks,
suggesting a cautious willingness to spend on even big ticket items.
The behaviour of M2, the monetary aggregate tracked most closely by the Fed,
which consists of currency, checking accounts and some savings accounts, has
also provided ammunition to the easing school. It was virtually unchanged in
May, and its growth so far this year is far below the Fed's target range.
Yet there is lively debate among economists as to just how relevant M2
should be for Fed decision-making, in view of the markedly different
behaviour of M1, the more narrowly defined aggregate, which has been growing
extremely rapidly.
The main weakness in M2 has been in small-time deposits and money market
mutual fund shares. This may be due in part to depositors shifting savings
into higher earning areas, taking advantage of the large disparity between
the yield on short and long - term instruments.
Mr Elliott Platt, at Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette, suspects that 'the
strength of M1, coupled with the strength of the savings deposit component
of M2, represents a shift of funds by consumers into forms which can be
readily used for transactions purposes.'
Inflation statistics released on Friday have also given comfort to the
easing school, which argues that they allow the Fed to cut rates without
fear of fuelling inflation. Consumer prices rose a mere one tenth of 1 per
cent in May, the smallest rise since January.
But a key question is the likely effect of a rate cut on the long end of the
credit markets, which influences corporate investment decisions and over
which the Fed has no direct control.
Rates here have remained stubbornly high over the past two years of
short-term easing, producing an extremely steep yield curve. This may be due
in part to international competition for capital and to the US budget
deficit, but residual fears of inflation have also played a substantial
role.
Opinion is divided as to whether another Fed easing would be positive for
the long end, causing yields to fall in line with the short end, or
negative, making yields rise amid fears of higher inflation.
Whatever the case, the Fed seems unlikely to consider moving until it has
substantially more statistical evidence to digest, with the publication of
new unemployment figures on July 2 a possible trigger date. Thereafter, the
presidential campaign will be hotting up, and historically the Fed has been
reluctant to change its stance and give ammunition to the politicians.

FT  15 JUN 92 / Government Bonds: German bonds take over as star performers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN THE aftermath of the Danish referendum, Bunds have been the star
performers of the European government security markets - but only in
relative terms.
At the end of last week, the yield on 10-year benchmark government bunds was
in the range of 7.90-7.92 per cent, compared with a yield of around 7.95 per
cent on June 2, the day of the referendum.
This small increase in absolute price terms translates into a considerable
outperformance when compared with soaring yields in other European bond
markets.
The reason? There has been a flight to quality as investors sold
high-yielding bonds which were supposed to benefit from the Maastricht
convergence process. Against the background of uncertainty, bunds offer a
haven.
But the cash realised by selling peseta or lira bonds was not automatically
switched into the bund market: as Mr Reiner Back, senior analyst with
Deutsche Bank in Frankfurt says, there would have been a more definitive
rise in bund prices if this had been so.
'The massive overweight positions in so-called 'convergence plays' - the
story of the last six months - have been unwound,' says Mr Mark
Houghton-Berry at Goldman Sachs in Frankfurt. 'But there has been a general
shift in sentiment away from Europe altogether.'
It appears the cash has gone into high-yielding D-Mark bank accounts - to
the short end of the yield curve - or switched to US or Canadian dollar bond
markets.
The fact is that on strictly fundamental grounds, bunds are no more
attractive than they were a month ago - when investors were worried about
the outlook for German money supply figures, inflation and public spending.
There is no more likelihood now that interest rates will be cut soon - the
fond hope of overseas investors who bought heavily after rates were lifted
to historically high levels last December.
Economists remain convinced a cut is unlikely to happen until the latter
part of the year at the earliest, and perhaps not this year at all.
Mr Back predicts a wave of buying later this month and next as the headline
inflation figures show a definite drop. He forecasts year-on-year inflation
will be 4.2 per cent this month and 3.3 per cent for July, against 4.6 per
cent in April.
Mr Robert Barrie, European economist with BZW Securities in London, says the
sharp drop in the inflation rate expected for next month is largely due to
last summer's mineral oil tax rises dropping out of the calculation.
The outlook for underlying inflation is still poor, and this, not the
headline rate, is likely to influence the Bundesbank's interest rate policy.

FT  15 JUN 92 / UK Gilts: Prices slide on convergence worries
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WORRIES about the long-term pattern of economic convergence across Europe
conspired with concern about the volume of gilt supply to push down prices,
especially at the long end of the yield curve.
These potential sources of turbulence for the market overshadowed a run of
good news on inflation, which indicated that pressures pushing up prices of
UK goods and services over the next year will be extremely small.
Investors are concerned that the progress made in the past year in bringing
gilt yields closer to those for German and French government bonds may soon
grind to a halt, as a result of doubts about whether European economic and
monetary union will take place as planned.
At the same time, the large volume of funding to finance Britain's growing
public sector deficits will probably drive yields upwards, particularly for
long-dated gilts.
Reflecting these fears, the long dated 9 per cent Treasury stock 2008 saw a
yield rise of 6 basis points, from 8.95 per cent to 9.01 per cent. The price
fell by just over half a point, to 99 13/16 .
At the short end, interest was greater, and yields for short-dated gilts
rose only marginally, if at all. For example, the 10 per cent Treasury stock
maturing in 1994 saw its yield unchanged at 9.24 per cent. Its price was
quoted on Friday night at 101 11/32 .
These trends reflect a tendency over the past month for investors to switch
down the yield curve, avoiding longer dated securities due to the funding
worries.
There is particular concern about whether the Bank of England will be able
to sell the Pounds 2bn or so of long-dated stock it is expected to auction
on June 24, without forcing up yields.
Meanwhile, the pace of the funding programme - to finance a public spending
deficit expected to be more than Pounds 30bn in 1992-1993 - was underlined
by the Bank's announcement on Friday that it is to issue Pounds 500m of 4
1/8 per cent index linked Treasury stock due in 2030 from today. The stock
is at the far end of the yield curve, of a maturity range unfamiliar to many
gilt specialists.
The market was, however, cheered by the rash of data on inflation which
indicated an extremely slow recovery from the UK recession, an event which
will put little rising pressure on gilt yields and should put a floor under
prices:
The rate of retail price inflation in the UK was unchanged last month, but
underlying trends remained on a downward path. A 0.4 per cent rise in the
retail prices index in May left the rate of increase in the 12 months to May
at 4.3 per cent, the same as in April. The RPI excluding mortgage interest
payments fell to 5.3 per cent in the year to May, the lowest since December
1988.
A Confederation of British Industry distributive trades survey said shop
prices were rising more slowly than at any time since the survey started in
1983. It also said any recovery in retail sales was likely to be sluggish
after the depressed state of this sector over the past 18 months.
The prices of manufactured goods leaving Britain's factories rose by 3.6 per
cent in May, the lowest annual rate of increase for five years. The producer
prices index, often taken as a measure of core inflation, rose 0.1 per cent
on the month, compared with a 0.4 per cent monthly rise in April, supporting
government hopes that upward pressure on prices will continue to ease.
Further evidence of the disinflationary momentum in the UK economy came from
the rise in the index excluding volatile food, drink and tobacco prices.
This rose by 0.2 per cent in May compared with the previous month, bringing
the year-on-year rate of change to 2.7 per cent, the lowest since June 1967.

stake
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE BANK of Finland has agreed to sell its shareholding in Skopbank, the
country's third largest commercial bank, which it saved from collapse last
autumn, to the Finnish government's newly formed Guarantee Fund.
The FM1.5bn (Dollars 349m) deal is expected to be signed in Helsinki today.
It is to be financed through a short-term credit line which the Bank of
Finland will extend to the Government Guarantee Fund for as long as
requir-ed.
After the transfer the fund will hold 52.9 per cent of Skopbank's equity and
63.59 per cent of its voting rights.
The Fund said the transfer of the shareholding would not affect Skopbank's
operations as a banking institution for the Finnish savings banks or as a
commercial bank and it would be responsible for its solvency.
Negotiations will continue over the sale of Skopbank and the restructuring
of the savings bank group so that it can once more be on a stable and secure
footing.
Last September the Central Bank was forced to take direct control of
Skopbank to save it from financial collapse.
As a result of its rescue operation the Bank of Finland estimates that it
has already lost FM4.9bn. The deal with the government will result in a
further loss of FM2bn.
On top of this the Bank of Finland's holding companies still hold assets
worth FM9.6bn from Skopbank. These are to be sold off within the next few
years when market conditions allow.

FT  15 JUN 92 / International Company News: Credit quality warning on
Japanese banks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO and MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE CREDIT quality of Japan's leading banks will remain under pressure
through most of this decade, warns Moody's Investment Service, the US credit
rating agency.
In The Future of the Japanese Banking System, a report to be published this
week, Moody's concludes Japanese banks will lose their stature as
international banks as they concentrate on low-risk domestic businesses.
Moody's expects the average rating for Japanese banks - currently between
Aa3 and A1 - to continue to decline, but remain in the A range through the
mid-1990s.
Japanese banks face a severe squeeze on profits due to loans stemming from
property related lending. Between 1984 and 1990, loans to property companies
rose from 6.6 per cent to 10.3 per cent of Japanese banks' domestic loans.
The banks, burdened by large unrealised losses, have also been hard hit by
the sharp fall in Japan's stock markets.
The gross amount of problem loans, including restructured loans, is well
over 10 per cent of portfolios at the weaker institutions. 'Japanese banking
has never faced asset quality deterioration of the scale in the postwar
period,' says Moody's.
Despite these problems, Japanese banks will not fail or default on deposits
or bonds, thanks to Japanese regulatory protection. However, Moody's points
out the financial authorities are using this crisis as an opportunity to
restructure the banking system.
Rather than recapitalise banks or materially improve their profitability,
the authorities are looking to change the shape of the system through
mergers and ultimately to reduce the size and role of the financial system
itself.
Due to the pressure on earnings and capital ratios, banks' strategy will
shift from market share to profitability, focusing on the quality of
borrowers rather than loan volumes.
In the international markets, credit concerns have increased international
funding costs for Japanese banks.
But Moody's points out the effect on Japan's economy will be limited, since
corporate funding needs will be met by borrowing in the growing debt
securities markets.
Moody's has upgraded its rating of the debt of Chemical Bank, citing the
progress it has made to cut costs, increase revenues and improve
capitalisation following last year's merger with New York rival
Manufacturers Hanover, writes Martin Dickson in New York.
The rating of the senior long term debt was raised to Baa1 from Baa2.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
NEGOTIATIONS have reached an advanced stage for the sale of Panini, the
Italian cartoon stickers company controlled by Maxwell Communication
Corporation, to a consortium of domestic, US and Spanish investors.
No price has been revealed as auditors are still going through Panini's
books. However, Mr Pier Domenico Gallo, an executive of the financial
boutique negotiating the transaction, said a sale could be signed 'within a
month'.
Panini, based in Modena, was bought by MCC for about L200bn between 1988 and
1989. However, the sale price is likely to be considerably lower owing to
the collapse in the company's profitability.
Panini is believed to have lost about L20bn (Dollars 16.7m) in its last
published set of accounts, and has an outstanding debt to MCC of some L40bn.
The consortium, which includes members of Panini's management and
institutional investors, also involves De Agostini, the Italian publishing
and cartographic house.
Although likely to buy only a minority stake, De Agostini may end up as the
biggest single shareholder and take operating control of Panini, according
to Mr Gallo.

'packets' in STET sale

<TEXT>
IRI, Italy's biggest state holding company, has set a price of L2,020,000
(Dollars 1,692) for each of the 'packets' of shares and warrants in the
latest dilution of its stake in the STET telecommunications group.
Investors have been keenly awaiting the price for the placement, which,
including warrants, will match last year's rights issue by Generali as the
biggest capital raising made by an Italian company.
STET is the IRI-owned holding company which controls Italy's state-owned
telecommunications activities, notably SIP, the main operating utility. Net
profits last year were L1,413bn on sales of L22,946bn.
Investors will be offered packets containing 1,000 ordinary STET shares, 50
warrants convertible into a further 500 ordinary shares, and 100 warrants
convertible into 1,000 savings shares.
IRI said the first group of warrants will be convertible into ordinary
shares at L2,100 a share, while the price for the savings shares linked to
the second tranche of warrants will be L2,000 a share.
Based on the closing price for STET's ordinary shares in Milan on Friday,
the packets represent a discount of around 5.7 per cent, against their
hypothetical market value of L2,143,000 each.
After all the warrants are exercised IRI's stake in STET will fall to 53 per
cent of the ordinary shares and just 1 per cent of the savings stock. IRI
currently owns around 69 per cent of the ordinary stock and 30 per cent of
the savings shares, if all outstanding warrants are exercised.
The European Commission remains concerned by new Italian legislation
governing stock market reform. Sir Leon Brittan, the EC's competition
commissioner, said in Milan: 'We are very concerned about this and have
indicated that' to the Italian authorities.
The Commission's objections focus on the law introducing Societa di
Intermediazione Mobiliare (SIM), Italy's new stockbroking and fund
management hybrid. Several countries have objected that the SIMs law
discriminates against financial institutions from outside Italy.
'We have had complaints from more than one country,' said Sir Leon. The
objections 'seem to have considerable substance. It is difficult to
reconcile this legislation with the rules of the European Community as they
stand.'

SAPPI, the South African pulp and paper group, has successfully completed
its Dollars 268m Euro-equity placing, the largest such offer by a South
African company since the lifting of sanctions against the country.
The proceeds will be used to finance Sappi's purchase of Hannover Papier,
the leading German manufacturer of coated paper.
However, it is understood that several investors were put off by African
National Congress plans for a mass action campaign, which gave rise to
renewed fears about political instability in the country.
The placing, at market price with no discount involved, was heavily
oversubscribed.
Mr Eugene Van As, executive chairman, said although demand from Europe had
been less than he hoped, he was satisfied with the outcome.
He said Sappi had been forced to cut back severely the allocation to South
African institutions in spite of the fact that Gencor, Sappi's parent
company, had agreed to take up less than 50 per cent of the South African
tranche to ensure a reasonable portion of South African requests for equity
were satisfied.
He would not disclose what portion of shares were placed offshore, but had
earlier expressed the hope that at least half, and possibly more, would go
abroad.

CARTER Holt Harvey, the New Zealand and Chilean forestry group, reported a
22 per cent rise in profits before extraordinary items in the year to March
31, and says it is well positioned to take advantage of improving economic
conditions.
Profits advanced to NZDollars 193.6m (USDollars 105.2m) from NZDollars
158.2m last year.
But after an extraordinary loss relating to an investment company associated
with the Carter family, who are no longer involved with the company, profit
slipped 8 per cent to NZDollars 179.8m.
Mr David Oskin, the new chief executive, said lower exchange rates and the
benefits from restructur-ing helped to lift earn-ings.
Mr Oskin's appointment follows the recent joint venture between his company,
International Paper, and Brierley Investments to run CHH.
The Chilean interests, 30 per cent of listed company Copec and investments
in fishing, fibreboard and plastics, provided a much improved return,
producing an after-tax share of retained earnings of NZDollars 72.6m, up
from NZDollars 48.4m last year.
In the past year, low international pulp and paper prices halved pre-tax
operating return to Dollars NZ61.5m.
The disappointing performance resulted from cyclically low prices combined
with significant non-recurring charges and operating inefficiencies from the
modernisation programme at the Kinleith mill.

Brooke Tool Engineering remained in the red in the six months to March 31
1992 with a loss of Pounds 1.57m, against Pounds 1.42m in the second half of
1990-91, and a corresponding profit of Pounds 122,000.
Mr Bernard Friend, chairman, said the result reflected sharply lower sales
volumes and inadequate margins. On top of that there exceptional charges of
Pounds 308,000 for redundancies and relocation and Pounds 200,000 for
goodwill on disposal of businesses.
Turnover at Pounds 9.6m was 29 per cent down on the opening six months of
1990-91 and 18 per cent lower than the second half. That was partly the
result of the sale of some businesses, but largely the falling off in order
books.
Mr Friend said action had been taken to eliminate losses and bring the
loss-making businesses into profit. Results of individual divisions were
mixed but most had shown an improving trend recently.
Losses per share were 3.5p (earnings 0.2p). No interim dividend is being
paid (0.25p).

Hawtal Whiting Holdings, the engineering consulting services group, made a
pre-tax profit of Pounds 197,000 in 1991 and is unlikely to be profitable in
the first half of the current year.
The dividend is cut from 4p to 0.1p.
Mr John Whitecross, chairman, said the group suffered some cutbacks in work
towards the end of December and into January this year that led to
reorganising the business into three geographical sectors.
Activity was below the 1991 level, and with long lead times in arranging
contracts 'we do not foresee any improvement at least until later in the
year'.
The 1991 profit compared with Pounds 6,000, restated after adjustments of
Pounds 879,000 resulting from incorrect accruals by the North American
operations. Action had been taken to change the financial management and
controls.
Turnover came to Pounds 63.4m (Pounds 60.9m). Trading remained difficult as
customers reorganised their businesses and product strategies in response to
the world-wide slump in car sales.
After tax credit Pounds 41,000 (charge Pounds 446,000) and higher minority
deficit, losses per share were 0.93p (7.8p).

FT  15 JUN 92 / International Company News: Alvis tops Pounds 1.5m after 50%
growth
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
INTEREST flowing from its positive cash balance enabled Alvis, the
engineering group, to advance pre-tax profit by 50 per cent in the six
months to March 31.
There was a Pounds 1.5m swing round to interest received of Pounds 450,000,
leading to a pre-tax profit of Pounds 1.56m (Pounds 1.04m). Turnover fell to
Pounds 42m (Pounds 45.3m) and operating surplus to Pounds 1.11m (Pounds
2.09m).
Mr John Robertshaw, chairman, said all companies traded profitably but
results of the Alvis Industries division were disappointing.
Margins at aerospace and transmissions were affected by the disruption
caused by the move of Self Changing gears to Walsgrave, logistics suffered a
sharp drop in the intake of spares orders from the MoD and vehicles saw some
delay in deliveries of Stormer carrier vehicles for the Starstreak missile
project.
Losses per share were again 0.8p and the interim dividend is held at 0.5p.

companies
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FT-SE 100 Index Steering Committee has issued the following statement:
An Irish company has complained to the EC Commission about the rules that
exclude non-UK companies from the FT-SE 100 index, arguing that these
discriminate against Irish companies.
Though the complaint names the London Stock Exchange, the ground rules for
the FT-SE index are set and interpreted by a committee of independent
representatives of users of the market, and not by the London Stock
Exchange.
Mr Peter Jones, chairman of the steering committee, replying to the Irish
company and to newspaper articles discussing its request for inclusion in
the index, has previously stated:
'The FT-SE 100 was specifically, and very deliberately, designed to be an
indicator of the performance of the UK market.
'The change of rules needed to allow non-UK companies to enter the index -
whether Irish, American or Japanese - would be a fundamental change to the
design of the index.'
The London Stock Exchange has replied to the commission's preliminary
inquiry, making it clear that in its view the complaint is misconceived in
fact and law.
The steering committee endorses the London Stock Exchange's response.

FT  15 JUN 92 / International Company News: 3i puts off flotation until next
year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
3i, the UK venture capital group, has been forced into yet another delay of
its planned flotation by the slowness of the economic recovery. It had
originally hoped to list its shares early this year, then shifted its sights
to November but has now postponed the date until next year.
As part of preparations for a float 3i plans further cost-saving measures on
top of those which have already reduced annual outgoings by Pounds 12m.
The company is only half way through a cost-cutting programme which has seen
staff numbers cut by a third to 670 over the past 18 months, and a reduction
from 11 to six in the number of senior managers, according to Mr Ewen
Macpherson, managing director.
Future savings will be achieved by a slow-down in recruitment and a
streamlining of administration systems rather than by redundancies. 3i plans
to make more extensive use of credit scoring techniques to assess new and
existing investments in preference to more subjective assessment techniques.
The short-term pressures normally associated with a stock market listing
will not lead to any changes in long-term investment policy, Mr Macpherson
said.
A study of 3i's investments by Prof Dick Brealey, of London Business School,
showed that its portfolio of unquoted investments had a natural dynamism
greater than that of investment trusts invested in quoted stocks.
Unquoted companies had a one in 10 chance of being taken over in a year
compared with quoted companies which had a one in 50 chance, the research
showed. This meant that very few companies stayed in 3i's portfolio for more
than 10 years.
These findings are of crucial importance to 3i. It has made great play of
being a long-term investor which does not pressurise the managements it
backs to sell off or float their companies.
But there are aspects of the way 3i does business which will change as a
result of the planned flotation. It believes its accounting policies have
been excessively conservative and will be more generous in future in valuing
its unquoted holdings.
It is also considering the possibility of increasing its involvement in the
management of other company's venture capital portfolios. It already manages
investments for three small investment trusts and expects further
opportunities to occur as a result of the consolidation presently under way
in the venture capital industry.

<TEXT>
DORLING Kindersley, the international publisher of such best-selling titles
as The British Medical Association's Complete Family Health Encyclopedia, is
to seek a full listing on the London Stock Exchange this autumn.
The proposed flotation, which should capitalise the company at between
Pounds 75m and Pounds 100m, is expected to raise in the region of Pounds 30m
which the company plans to use to fuel the company's already rapid
development.
Sales, which four years ago amounted to Pounds 10m, are expected to increase
80 per cent this year to Pounds 71m. Pre-tax profits of Pounds 3.4m last
year are predicted to rise accordingly.
Mr Peter Kindersley, the chairman who co-founded Dorling in 1974, said the
company's new US publishing operation was also ripe for expan-sion.
The US is Dorling's biggest market accounting for 36 per cent of turnover,
compared with 27 per cent in the UK.
Dorling is also developing a multimedia package with Microsoft which the US
computer software group predicts will generate sales of Pounds 1bn a year by
the end of the decade.
The share issue is being sponsored by Barclays de Zoete Wedd with Cazenove
appointed as broker.

COMPAQ, the US computer maker, will today unveil low-priced desktop and
notebook personal computers, as it revamps its product and marketing
strategy to regain momentum against cheap 'clone' makers.
Compaq will also slash the prices of several products by up to 30 per cent.
Competitors are expected to follow suit in this latest round of the personal
computer price war.
Throughout the 1980s, Compaq grew by offering leading-edge personal computer
technology at a premium price. However, market share has declined over the
past two years.
Last October, after a reshuffle in which Mr Rod Canion, president and chief
executive and a co-founder of the company was replaced, Compaq announced it
would offer products that competed on price rather than features.
Today, Compaq will unveil the ProLinea line of desktop personal computers
aimed at the under Dollars 2,000 (Pounds 1,098) segment of the market, which
represents more than 50 per cent of all desktop personal computers sold in
the US.
US prices start at Dollars 899 for a 386SX model with a 40MB hard drive and
2MB of internal memory, and range up to Dollars 1,899 for a 486DX model with
120MB hard drive and 4MB of internal memory.
The new notebook computers, called the Contura line, come in two models with
US prices ranging from Dollars 1,700 to Dollars 2,500.

FT  15 JUN 92 / Banks shore up shaky property foundations / Explaining the
fashion for behind-the-scenes rescues
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE prospects for the UK commercial property industry, locked into its third
year of decline, are as diverse and uncertain as ever.
For every investor who asserts that the slump is over - as Mr John Ritblat,
chairman of British Land, did last Thursday - there is a developer who
claims that the bottom is not even in sight. Thus, Regalian's accounts were
qualified last week on the grounds that its development sites and empty
property defied precise valuation.
But the biggest sources of uncertainty are the banks. Tremors from last
month's spectacular corporate failures are rippling through the UK property
market, prompting speculation about the next large property company to
collapse.
Although Mountleigh's failure was long-expected, the collapse of Canary
Wharf has disconcerted an industry that thought it was hardened to bad news.
More than a third of investment and development companies recently
interviewed by Gallup expected the clearing banks to clamp down on their
credit lines as a result of the Canary Wharf collapse. The prospect of more
corporate failures is perceived to be not a question of if, but when.
But fears of a sudden melt-down are probably misplaced. The character of
this property slump is very different from that of 1974, when defaults by
property companies threatened to trigger the failure of the secondary banks.
This time round, most of the lending is syndicated amongst large banks which
are better able to absorb the losses.
As a result, one of the most striking features of this property slump is the
support shown by the banks for companies which appear to be prime candidates
for receivership.
A cursory glance at the share prices listed at the back of this newspaper
shows that a large number of quoted trading and development companies are
nearly worthless. The difficulty of letting and selling buildings has forced
scores of companies to breach banking covenants and left them without
sufficient income to service bank debt.
But for the most part, banks are responding to companies' pleas to defer
their interest payments or reconstruct their debts. For every high-profile
failure, there are many more successful rescues behind the scenes.
The banks' patience can be ascribed to a combination of common sense,
desperation and wishful thinking.
The most convincing reason for the banks' forbearance is that they would
gain nothing from putting a company into receivership. They would prefer to
leave the company in the hands of the management than pay handsomely for
receivers who have limited property expertise.
'Banks would far rather work with, not against, the incumbent management who
know the assets best,' said Sir John Quinton, chairman of Barclays Bank, the
biggest UK lender to the property industry.
Exceptions occur where the banks have lost faith in the company's
management. The failure of Mountleigh, for instance, was partly due to the
City's exasperation with its frequent changes of management and strategy. It
was also due to the presence of bondholders demanding payment, another
common cause of receiverships. Banks are often reluctant to allow
bondholders, who have a lesser claim to the company's assets, to take money
out of the business.
Another crucial incentive for the banks to avoid receiverships is the impact
it has on asset values. A survey published by English &amp; Overseas Properties
last week found that four out of five of the UK's top 30 receivers believed
that banks were reluctant to put assets under receivership for fear of
realising massive losses in asset values.
The problem is partly that potential buyers force down prices when companies
are in receivership. Although the receivers invariably stress that they 'are
not looking for distress sales', a company in receivership undoubtedly has
less bargaining power. 'Receivership has an unfortunate taint' said one of
Canary Wharf's bankers, explaining its choice of administration rather than
receivership.
A related problem is that assets deteriorate under receivership. Creditors
often believe it is throwing good money after bad to fund property
maintenance. The budget set aside by the banks is exclusively for marketing
purposes, rather than for enhancing or improving the building to retain its
value.
But in some instances, the most important motivation for keeping a company
going is that the banks want to minimise their provisions.
Selling property crystallises a loss and in the current state of the market,
the resultant damage to a bank's balance sheet would tend to be greater than
if it estimated the fall in value. Banks would rather take provisions over a
two- or three-year period. They will want to avoid provisions and write-offs
that shrink their capital at a time when the Bank for International
Settlements' new capital adequacy regime is being introduced.
Critics argue that banks' willingness to keep property companies in business
largely stems from a desire to take the simplest approach rather than add to
the daunting problems already on their plate.
A perception exists that the banks are floundering where their property
loans are concerned. A head of a large surveying firm, recently drafted in
by one of the clearing banks to help with the property casualties,
discovered huge numbers of doubtful property loans stuffed into files in
alphabetical order. 'They just don't know what they've got,' he says.
Banks are also criticised in some quarters for believing that holding back
on receiverships will help foster a recovery, which will ultimately allow
them to get more back from delinquent loans.
As matters stand, the market is deadlocked. At the top end of the market,
representing 15 per cent of the total, there is unsatisfied demand, which
could be slaked by property coming on the market. 'More receiverships will
bring liquidity to the market. It will bring investors in at more realistic
levels which will enhance the market,' says Mr Mike Riley of Chesterton,
chartered surveyors.
For the remainder of the market, the problem is an absence of finance, as
banks are not prepared to extend new loans on property that is in any way
flawed. 'Unless the banking sector starts lending and takes more risk, it
will be very difficult to finance a recovery,' says Mr Riley.
This poses a large question over the banks' ability to extricate themselves
from their problem property loans.
Memories of the last property crash when the banks were able, with time, to
work through their problems are misleading. Inflation reduced the scale of
those debts; yet now indebted companies are suffering from one of the
highest level of interest rates, adjusted for inflation, since the 1930s.
Problems created by the banks' headlong rush into property lending at the
end of the 1980s are likely to be around for some years yet.

FT  15 JUN 92 / Financial reporting of banks criticised
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MANY LARGE banks around the world use hidden reserves to conceal their true
results and provide poor examples of financial reporting, according to an
analysis conducted by accountants KPMG Peat Marwick and Lafferty Business
Research.
Australian and Canadian banks provide the best quality information in their
annual accounts while their German and Austrian competitors the worst, the
study concludes.
Only eight of the leading 100 banks worldwide are considered to have
financial reporting of notably high quality in their accounts, while 20
score less than 40 per cent in ratings devised by Peats, auditor to more
than one third of the banks described.
Australia and New Zealand Banking Group, the Bank of Montreal and the Royal
Bank of Canada are among the highest rated. The lowest score was given to
Zentralsparkasse und Kommerzialbank in Austria, now part of Bank Austria.
The ratings awarded three-quarters of total points for the provision of
financial information such as statements on accounting policies and
information on non-performing loans, and one quarter for other information
like employment practices and strategy statements.
Many banks outside the Anglo-Saxon world make use of hidden reserves or
excess general provisions which are not disclosed and cannot be quantified
by users of accounts.
Most banks do not reveal sufficient information on their provisions for bad
debts, and only 14 reported the interest written-off on non-performing
loans.
'The Swiss have improved their reporting in the last few years, but Germany
is still pretty abysmal,' said Mr Michael Lafferty, one of the authors.
British banks ranked about average in the survey, with Bank of Scotland and
Barclays performing best. But few provided much information on their
directors or employment practices.
Eleven received a qualified report from auditors, expressing doubts about
information in the accounts. The Bank of Taiwan does not contain an
auditor's report at all.

FT  15 JUN 92 / Economics Notebook: North and South may yet become friends
after Rio
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ARE relations between the developed industrial nations and the developing
world about to take a turn for the better?
The question seems an odd one in the wake of the Earth Summit in Rio de
Janeiro where the discussion between North and South often appeared
acrimonious.
But there are straws in the wind to suggest that the forthcoming economic
summit of the Group of Seven leading industrial nations in Munich could mark
a new beginning in North-South relations as both sides struggle to come to
terms with the post-communist world.
Germany's Chancellor Mr Helmut Kohl is planning to have only five formal
items on the agenda of his summit meeting with the leaders of the US, Japan,
France, Britain, Italy, Canada and the European Community.
Links with the developing world are second on the list after the traditional
opening round of talks on the world economy and growth. Third World ties
have been placed ahead of items covering future relations with the former
Soviet Union and with eastern and central Europe and dealing with proposals
to make safe the nuclear power stations of the former east bloc.
Another sign that the big industrialised nations want to involve developing
countries more closely with the economic future of the planet has come from
Mr Nicholas Brady, the US Treasury Secretary. He will be meeting finance
ministers from 11 Latin American countries on Wednesday and Thursday of next
week to hear their views on trade, debt and investment in the region ahead
of the Munich talks. This will be the first such hemispheric gathering ahead
of a G7 summit.
Nor have the developing nations been holding back from initiating contacts
with the G7. Mr Abdou Diouf, the president of Senegal, recently wrote to the
German government on behalf of 15 developing countries asking to be able to
appear at the Munich summit. This request was turned down. But Mr Horst
Kohler, the senior German official preparing the summit, met the Senegalese
foreign minister and has ensured that the points made by the G15 have been
fed into the preparations for the discussions in Munich in July.
The G15 includes such large and potentially powerful countries as Algeria,
Argentina, Brazil, Egypt, India, Indonesia, Nigeria, Mexico and Venezuela.
Germany has undertaken to brief Senegal as chairman of the G15 about the
Munich summit discussions.
These contacts are reminiscent of early links between the G7 and the Soviet
Union at the end of the 1980s. Mr Mikhail Gorbachev caused a minor sensation
in July 1989 when he wrote to the Paris G7 summit to propose closer
co-operation between the summit powers and the then Soviet Union. By the
1990 Houston summit, Mr Gorbachev's proposal had turned into an appeal for
G7 aid for his struggling empire. Last year's London economic summit marked
one of Mr Gorbachev's last notable appearances on the world stage when he
met the G7 leaders for a special session of talks after the formal summit
proceedings were over. In Munich, Mr Boris Yeltsin, president of Russia,
will join the G7 leaders for an afternoon of discussions after the summit.
Western officials stress that there are no plans to turn the pre- and
post-Munich contacts with the G15 into a formal North-South dialogue. It is
also unlikely that the links will be as close as those that have been
established with, first, the Soviet Union and, now, Russia. But Germany's
positive reaction to the Senegalese approach marks a change of style
compared with earlier years. In the past, the US, Japan and Germany, in
particular, have resisted moves that seemed likely to embroil the G7 deeply
in the North-South debate.
An important reason for this change lies in the willingness of developing
countries such as the G15 members to embrace western concepts of market
economics, good governance and democracy. The detailed points made by the
G15 in their letter to the Bonn government have not been disclosed. But
officials from the industrialised countries say they have been impressed by
the 'realistic' views expressed by the Senegalese-led group and the
convergence between the viewpoints of the G7 and G15.
Chancellor Kohl believes the problems facing the industrialised countries
can only be solved together with the developing nations. His objective at
the Munich summit will be to ensure that his fellow leaders share this view.
In non-economic areas, there are important issues that clearly need shared
solutions. The environment is one that has had a full airing in Rio. Other
problems that can best be tackled through co-operation include immigration,
action to control epidemics and the international trade in drugs.
In the economic sphere, the industrialised nations are learning that they
can benefit from closer ties with the developing world. This realisation lay
behind President George Bush's Enterprise for the Americas Initiative (EAI),
launched nearly two years ago, and Mr Brady's decision to invite the Latin
American finance ministers to Washington next week.
The advantages of closer North-South ties in the context of Latin America
were spelled out recently by Mr David Mulford, the US Treasury under
secretary for international affairs, in a lecture to the Heritage
Foundation, a Washington-based free-enterprise policy research institute.
The US, he said, needed 'Latin America's economic prosperity and political
well-being now and increasingly' as the world grew more competitive. Every
Dollars 1bn (Pounds 500m) of US exports to Latin America created 20,000 US
export-related jobs, he noted.
However, protectionist sentiment in the industrialised countries is a
significant barrier to a more fruitful relationship between North and South.
So long as the Uruguay Round of trade liberalisation talks are stalled, the
G7 and the other industrialised nations will be poorly placed to make the
best of moves towards market-based economics and political pluralism in
developing countries.

FT  15 JUN 92 / The Lex Column: Electricity
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Today's annual results from East Midlands Electricity should show pre-tax
profits up by more than a third. As other regional electricity companies
report, that might come to look positively modest. Norweb is set to report
more than doubled pre-tax profits, while its earnings per share will be
perhaps 130 per cent higher.
To be fair, there is an element of catch-up, thanks to the government's
underestimate of inflation in the year of privatisation. But that will
scarcely cut much ice with customers and politicians. Nor, given the
pressure on other utilities, will it be sufficient to protect the RECs from
greater scrutiny by their own regulator. It is hard to see how Offer can
avoid commenting on the scale of the profits growth, even if only to stress
that customers must benefit as well as shareholders.
On that front, the companies face a dilemma. Privately, many of the RECs
admit that they can sustain 8 per cent real dividend increases for the
foreseeable future. Yet that is twice as much as the government allowed for
at privatisation. To date, Professor Littlechild has stuck firmly to a
long-term view of his industry. Doubtless he will gradually take a less
academic approach. Until it becomes clear what that means for dividends,
prudent investors will doubtless prefer the slightly safer water sector.

FT  15 JUN 92 / The Lex Column: Steel
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
British Steel's results - and probable dividend cut - are two weeks away. It
is worth considering the market backdrop against which the payout will be
determined. The price increases of some 3 to 4 per cent imposed by European
steel producers in the first quarter stuck at the time. But thanks partly to
the industry's failure to manage a cut in supply, the market has turned soft
again. There are scant grounds for expecting an upturn in demand, given the
weak outlook for the European economy dictated by Germany's tight monetary
policy, surplus capacity in eastern Europe and the anaemic US recovery.
The immediate prospects thus hardly give British Steel an incentive to err
on the side of generosity. Investors are probably right to expect at best a
final dividend of 1.5p against 5.75p last year. Admittedly, there are
belated signs of European production being reined back. That could show
through in pricing from the mid-year onwards. Perhaps the market could be
kick-started if the prospect of higher prices persuaded customers to rebuild
their stocks. But that seems fanciful if, as County NatWest calculates, 11
per cent of Europe's hot-rolled steel capacity is surplus to requirements.
All the same, British Steel could yet prove one of the great European
survivors in its industry. Its rationalisation programme has given it an
edge in terms of cost. But its problem remains the snail's pace at which
cutbacks are proceeding elsewhere in Europe. Even high-cost German producers
are reluctant to get out, as the acrimony over the Krupp takeover of Hoesch
shows. The biggest danger is that as European interest rates fall, economic
recovery next year may create an excuse for further delay in
rationalisation. That could make British Steel's efficiency less relevant in
the context of a market beset with chronic subsidised oversupply.

<TEXT>
Last week's dividend cut from Pilkington and dividend warning from Taylor
Woodrow were a reminder of the fragility of UK equity values. On a rolling
12-month basis, growth in UK dividends may now be a mere 1 per cent. In
calendar 1992 it could be little better, in which case dividends will have
lagged inflation for the third year running. In past recessions, the fall in
real dividends was more severe. But these were times of high inflation and
lower or negative real interest rates, making the alternatives of cash or
bonds more unattractive still.
Today, the choice between asset classes is made harder by fresh uncertainty
about inflation. If the Maastricht treaty falls apart, the UK's commitment
to the ERM may come under renewed scrutiny. It used to be argued that if ERM
membership meant the UK could enjoy German inflation rates, gilts no longer
needed to offer the same yield premium over equities. If that principle is
being challenged at the same time as real dividends continue to fall, what
price the yield ratio?
The conservative answer would be to trust to equities, however bad the
short-term outlook for dividends. The belief that inflation is conquered is
less convincing at the bottom of the economic cycle than it would be at the
top. And while the importance of a fixed exchange rate system in controlling
inflation is real enough, it is worth recalling that when gilt yields first
rose above equity yields, in the 1950s and 1960s, sterling was a member of
the ERM's predecessor, Bretton Woods.

FT  15 JUN 92 / The Lex Column: GPA on the runway
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The latest airline price war in the US is unfortunately timed from GPA's
point of view. It may be a short-term phenomenon, but it is a sober reminder
that the fortunes of the world's biggest aircraft leasing group ultimately
depend on the profitability of its customers. As BA's annual report pointed
out last week, airlines' losses on international scheduled services totalled
Dollars 4bn last year. Investors will be unwise therefore to subscribe for
GPA's public offer if they are not confident that the air transport sector
is set to resume its upward flight path in the mid and late 1990s.
It is hard to fault GPA's recent record. The company has come through a
turbulent period with minimal damage to earnings. It has an enviable, and
possibly unparalleled, knowledge of the market, notably of the smaller
carriers and the associated credit risks. It is financially innovative, as
last week's successful Dollars 520m issue of securitised aircraft leases
clearly demonstrated.
This capacity to raise new capital, though, is crucial to GPA's long-term
survival, as the prospectus frankly admits. There are commitments to buy
almost Dollars 12bn of new aircraft by the end of the century, but only
enough money in the kitty to take the group through to next June. So far GPA
has avoided the worst effects of declining lease rates and lower residual
values - but it cannot do so indefinitely without a market recovery. It has
been hard for the advisers to price the risks - but a prospective 9-10 times
multiple is probably fair at this uncertain stage in the cycle.

FT  15 JUN 92 / Letter: Something to learn from a 20-year track record on
forecasting
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Messrs BOB ROWTHORN and KEN COUTTS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, In his article 'Economic forecasts can endanger your wealth' (June 1),
Martin Wolf states: 'Despite 50 years of practice . . . the ability of
economists to provide precise forecasts, even for the very near term, is
very much in question.' He goes on to suggest reasons for this 'persistent
failure'.
Why does Martin Wolf make no reference to Prof Wynne Godley and his economic
policy group (CEPG), which has maintained a respectable, if not excellent,
record for more than 20 years? In particular, the most recent recession has
been quite accurately characterised by the CEPG ever since September 1989,
in contributions to the Observer, New Statesman, Financial Times, as well as
other publications. For instance, on January 18 1991, Godley wrote in The
New Statesman:
'With no change in policy, the squeeze on profits and corporate liquidity
will probably cause a big fall in investment this year and next, while
falling real income and reduced borrowing by households will make for lower
consumption; with world trade slowing down and export margins under
pressure, there is unlikely to be much stimulus from exports. . .I expect a
significant absolute fall (in GDP) of 1-2 per cent between 1990 and 1991,
with some further fall thereafter, causing unemployment to rise to more than
2.5m by mid-1992. The balance of payments deficit will improve to 1-1.5 per
cent of GDP, but only because the recession will reduce imports, not because
of any improvement to speak of in competitive performance.
'I expect the underlying inflation rate to improve, though only slowly. . .'
This forecast could hardly be better, even if every statement is not
precisely accurate.
Perhaps Martin Wolf can only watch the herd and cannot see anything which
does not conform with it. He would do well to consider, instead, whether he,
and the mainstream forecasters, have something to learn from Prof Godley.

<TEXT>
Sir, We are saddened by your report 'United front falls apart - Susan Moore
finds discord at the Grosvenor House Fair' (June 13).
Mr Kenneth Snowman received complete justice from his colleagues on the
executive committee of the Grosvenor House Antiques Fair concerning his
company's Franco-Burgundian pendant.
Any exhibitor who is dissatisfied with the decision of a specialist
committee which has rejected an artefact can have the right of appeal to the
executive committee of the fair.
This procedure was meticulously adhered to, at his request, and a judgment
was made in favour of the artefact being allowed into the fair. This is not
a unique reversal of a decision.
The fact that the pendant later won the 'Artefact of the year' award at the
fair should surely be matter of additional satisfaction to Mr Snowman. We
regret his decision that 'Wartski's will never exhibit again', but this
pre-supposes that the organisers will decide to exercise their prerogative
by inviting him.
Olga Polizzi, and Raymond O'Shea, co-chairmen of the Grosvenor House
Antiques Fair, and the following of the executive committee:
William Agnew, Konrad Bernheimer, Christopher Clarke, Elaine Dean, Nicholas
Fowle, Roger Keverne, Charles Lee, George Levy, Baden Marston, Nicolas

FT  15 JUN 92 / Letter: Accountability the essential feature of corporate
well-being
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Dr MAURICE GILLIBRAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, However much I disagree with Sir Owen Green's approach to corporate
governance (Personal View, June 9) his contribution must be welcomed as a
stimulant to the debate on this vital issue.
Accountability is an essential feature of any corporate activity if it is to
be effective and efficient. The inability of British businesses to compete
with their counterparts in Germany and Japan since the Second World War is a
consequence of the erosion of the accountability of the managers of the
businesses to the shareholders. Accountability, according to the Companies
Act, is vested in the authority of the annual general meeting of
shareholders. Regrettably, this has been rendered ineffective by the
automatic support of existing managements by the proxy votes of the
institutions. Accordingly, managements have become self-perpetuating and
fail to realise the full potential of the business.
However, Sir Owen opposes even the limited strengthening of accountability
as proposed by the Cadbury Committee. He regards the appointment of
non-executive directors with responsibilities to monitor the interests of
shareholders as being against the principles of a unitary board. He goes
even further and challenges those who believe in a need to monitor the
activities of the executive to have the courage of their convictions and
advocate a two-tier board structure. On this point I find myself in full
agreement with Sir Owen.

Sir, Having worked in Spain for two years, I feel that many of the comments
in your article 'Start at El Aeropuerto' (FT survey of Spain, June 1) were
ill-informed, exaggerated or simply not true.
For example, bank service, on the whole, is much more efficient than in
England. Also, Barcelona airport is not too big: forecasts say it will be
too small from 1998 onwards.
The tone of the article was negative and showed only a partial view of
Spain. To show Spaniards as inefficient and almost stupid is not funny.

FT  15 JUN 92 / Leading Article: A better way for buses
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN NEEDS its buses. They make much more efficient use of road space
than private cars. By far the quickest and cheapest way to tackle urban
traffic congestion would be to persuade more people to use them.
Instead, buses are in a spiral of decline. People have left them for the
greater speed and convenience of the car; the cars have worsened the traffic
jams; the jams have played havoc with the bus services; and so more people
have switched to cars.
In 1985, the government set out to reverse this decline by deregulating the
market (though initially excluding London). Hitherto, a highly restrictive
route licensing system had effectively ruled out competition between
operators. That was swept away, leaving anyone free to run a service
wherever they liked. The state-owned National Bus Company was broken up and
privatised, and the municipal bus companies were put on a commercial footing
in readiness for a gradual sell-off.
In theory, deregulation should have led to a proliferation of bus services,
greater efficiency, lower fares, and a rise in passenger numbers. Indeed, it
did score successes: efficiency soared, largely because of reductions in
wage costs, and subsidies were more than halved, largely because local
authorities were no longer allowed to operate low-fare policies.
By the most significant measure of all, however, deregulation has proved a
disaster. The decline in bus use, far from slowing, has accelerated:
passenger numbers outside London have fallen by 19 per cent since
deregulation, and by 26 per cent in the metropolitan areas.
Disappointing record
Perhaps the biggest single reason for this disappointing performance is the
government's failure to realise that, in the bus business, the operator who
wins the most passengers is not the one who offers the best service or the
lowest fares, but the one who gets to the bus stop first.
Thus many an established operator has been driven to the wall by cut-throat
competition from new entrants of indifferent quality; and the passenger's
experience of deregulation has too often been one of high fares, chaotic
services and an increasingly decrepit bus fleet.
All this would be less alarming were it not combined with the government's
frequent boast that bus mileage has risen by 19 per cent since deregulation.
The result is that significantly more buses are running around fighting over
significantly fewer passengers, particularly in urban areas. In other words,
buses are worsening congestion instead of relieving it.
Second thoughts
Extraordinarily, in the face of all the evidence pointing to deregulation's
failings, it remains the government's avowed intent to extend it to the
capital. And yet, in recent weeks, there have been glimmerings of second
thoughts. There was no mention of the necessary legislation in the Queen's
Speech, and the transport department has unexpectedly set up a consultative
forum on the topic.
If a reappraisal is indeed under way, it is to be strongly welcomed. It
should start by noting that, in the period during which bus passenger
journeys fell by 26 per cent in the metropolitan areas which had been
deregulated, it rose by 4 per cent in still-regulated London. It should also
note that the capital's buses have seen big increases in operating
efficiencies over the same period, and that this has been achieved without
impeding the capital's traffic. The reason is that a third of London's bus
routes are now operated by the private sector under franchise from London
Transport, after bidding through a competitive tender against London Buses
for the exclusive right to operate them.
This surely shows the way forward for buses in Britain. It cannot make sense
to open up the capital's routes to a free-for-all when experience elsewhere
has shown that it threatens traffic chaos. Having missed the opportunity to
franchise out the management of Britain's airports and water authorities,
the government now appears to have come round to an appreciation of
franchising's merits for British Rail's passenger services. It should now
see the virtue of franchising for the bus industry - not just for London,
but for the long-suffering regions, too.

FT  15 JUN 92 / Leading Article: Many roads from Rio
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
   THE RIO conference was worth having
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
once. It should not be repeated. A conclave of nearly 150 heads of
government addressing all the world's problems simultaneously is not a forum
from which immediately useful results can reasonably be expected. Yet the
Earth Summit was not a complete waste of time. Its value is in the first
instance educational; beyond that the treaties that have been signed may in
due course begin to influence the future actions of governments. They should
certainly give a fillip to the most powerful agency for environmental
protection: public opinion.
No one can now ignore the pressure to reduce emissions that contribute to
global warming. Those who, like the US government, are sceptical about
scientific forecasts of a greenhouse effect appear to have been brought
round to an appreciation of the logic behind the precautionary principle.
This suggests that some measures to curb CO and other destructive gases are
worth taking today because the damage that will be done if the scientists
are even half-right is so great. The price of insurance is relatively low.
Again, the protection of endangered species is a universally accepted goal,
embraced by President George Bush as well as by the 139 countries that did
sign the relevant treaty. The driving force is economic as well as
ecological. Proper management of forests is an acknowledged ambition; even
the Malaysians are aware of the potential force of customer resistance to
the purchase of tropical hardwoods. There may be no treaty but if there are
reluctant customers the growers will want to proclaim their sustainable
management of forests. If not much was said in Rio about the most
destructive phenomenon of them all - overpopulation - the very omission of
the topic should have served to remind many of the participants of its
importance.
Soft treaties
So much for the good news. The hard truth is that the agreements concluded
at the conference necessarily reflect the lowest common denominator of
national interests. The treaties are soft. The binding declarations are
loose. The agreements to disagree are dead-ends. This outcome is in itself
part of the educational process. The group of 77 developing countries cannot
be blamed for trying to see how much the rich world is willing to pay for
environmental protection; its leaders go home with a clearer understanding
that the amount is small, while the terms upon which it will be released are
strict.
Summit lessons
That is perhaps the principal lesson of the summit. It was conducted as if
it was an away-meeting of the United Nations General Assembly. As such it
once again demonstrated that the demands of the many would always be
rejected by the few. The framers of the UN charter were well aware of this
defect of mass meetings. That is why they put in place a Security Council
whose permanent members reflected the global balance of power. If the UN is
to adopt protection of the environment as a goal equal in importance to
keeping the peace it must establish a similar top-level steering committee.
This might evolve out of the proposed Sustainable Development Commission.
Its membership should reflect the balance of economic power while not
allowing the interests of business to override those of either
environmentalists or the developing world.
A second lesson is that no human organisation can tackle everything in one
meeting. It is true in theory that protection of the environment is bound up
with both development and population control, but specific issues in each
area need specific solutions. The Montreal convention on phasing out CFCs,
the gases that damage the ozone layer, is a good example. Public pressure
has built on this, and CFCs are on their way out. Greenhouse gases need at
least one treaty, one convention and one monitoring mechanism to themselves;
perhaps CO needs its own international agreement. Forests need another.
Endangered species a third. The Rio meeting, with its several mechanisms for
further action, has made a hazy start, but if there is to be genuine
progress before the end of the century the proper disaggregation of
environmental strategies is a necessary first step.

FT  15 JUN 92 / A Better Day - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It was a good idea to write a musical about Keir Hardie and to stage it at
the old socialist stronghold of the Theatre Royal, Stratford East. Not only
was he the founder of the Independent Labour Party, he won a famous
by-election in what was then the local constituency of West Ham South in
1892. He also had a romantic side, notably his love affair with Sylvia
Pankhurst, the suffragette, and indeed with several Fabian ladies.
All the ingredients for a boisterous, irreverent, participatory performance
are there. The author is Sheila Yeger, whose writing we have learned to
admire not least from her recent Self-Portrait, a play about the artist,
Gwen John. The director is Annie Casteldine, who is up among the top. Do not
be put off by the piece being commissioned by Nalgo; there could be worse
things for a trade union to do than getting into theatre.
Yet the trouble is that A Better Day does not quite come off - or at least
not yet. One is reminded of Professor Dahrendorf's remark about Edward
Heath's manifesto 'A Better Tomorrow'; what he really meant was a better
yesterday. It would be pleasant to report that the shortcomings on the first
night were due to the performance being too slow, which it was. However,
there may be a deeper reason, which is that socialism is neither funny nor
self-confident any more: it's dead. I never expected to sit through
'Jerusalem' in this theatre with the audience scarcely having the enthusiasm
to join in.
That is at the end of the first act. The second, which is much better, has a
performance of 'The Red Flag' which has a pretty stirring tune. It comes
across like a dirge.
Some lines in the text bear out the interpretation that few people, even in
Stratford East, are prepared to cheer for socialism any more. Keir Hardie
condemns the idea of a Lib-Lab pact, which was as much talked about at the
start of the 20th century as it is towards the end. There is no applause for
his advice that socialists should have nothing to do with it; only what I
took to be a thoughtful silence.
A Better Day has its lacunae. One of the lines is 'When in doubt, sing'. In
the absence of sustained dialogue, that could be the guiding principle of
the piece. Stratford East has always been good at that sort of thing. And
when Elizabeth Mansfield as Sylvia Pankhurst leads her cohorts in 'If you
won't give the vote to the ladies, there'll be no more kisses for you', the
old place is back at its best. The show is worth seeing for Ms Mansfield
alone, as well as the nostalgia.
Hardie died in 1915. One of his girl friends, Agnes Hughes - played here by
Shona Morris - claims in her diaries that she communicated with him through
a medium in 1945. She said he expressed his doubts that the newly elected
Labour government would stick to the guidelines of the Sermon on the Mount.
One awaits with fascination a new biography of Hardie by Caroline Benn due
out this summer. Meanwhile, don't overlook Stratford East.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
There was a massive congregation at Wembley on Saturday for a day of ritual
and preaching. 'Let's talk about saving someone,' said the Holy-roller.
'Let's get this straight - you can't save anyone. You can't even save
yourself.'
Oh, all right. This wasn't John Selwyn Gummer cracking up while addressing
the 7,000 Anglicans rallying against women priests at Wembley Arena; it was
Axl Rose, the less than Holy rock-and-roller getting 70 odd thousand stirred
up at Wembley Stadium. 'Save your own ass' was his anti-Calvinist cry, as he
led his band into 'Live and let die'.
It made for a good show, getting two groups of committed believers packing
the two ends of Wembley. The Church of England won hands down for style,
lots of colourful vestments and banners. The Guns N' Roses fans actually
wore very little. (Indeed before the band appeared, a happy hour was spent
with the exhibitionists in the crowd trying to attract the eye of the video
cameraman servicing the giant screens - girls baring breasts scored over
guys baring bottoms.)
But when it came to enthusiasm the rockers won hands up. Axl, the man who
could do little right in his youth, can do little wrong now he is the
official bad boy of pop, and Wembley has scarcely ever been more roused.
Axl's reputation is not entirely PR puff. His criminal record is longer than
his list of hits, and he was unlucky enough to be on stage at Donnington
when two fans were crushed to death. The money and the fame have mellowed
him although he still foulmouths obstreperous fans at the front.
The band mixes heavy metal with punk with old-fashioned rock, which means
that the guitarist goes bare chested and long haired; the drummer gets his
15 minute solo; there are fireworks and giant inflatables of monsters; and
Axl dashes around the stage liked a beheaded chicken.
As a hate figure Axl is a dead loss. There is something mesmerising about
the man, with his stringy ginger beard, his bandanna over long wild hair,
his shorts and high black boots - he looks just like the madman who shouts
at crowds. But his voice, like his energy, never waivers, and his best
songs, like 'Sweet child of mine', are deliberately as catchy as traditional
rock anthems. He embraces rather than alienates, and ends with a standard
that could have been picked up by the faithful in the Arena - 'Knocking on
Heaven's door'. Give it a year or two and Axl will be taking tea with the
Archbishop of Canterbury.

DAKS Simpson, which is now owned by the Japanese Sankyo Seiko group, has
appointed a new chief executive to replace the flamboyant pony-tailed Johnny
Mengers who left earlier this year after 40 years with the stylish UK

The new boss is 56-year-old Jeremy Franks, who has been managing director of
the group - which includes manufacturing, licensing, wholesaling and
accessories as well as retailing - since February 1991.
Prior to that he had, since 1984, been running the Simpson Piccadilly store.
Despite speculation, when Mengers went, that there had been friction between
him and the new Japanese shareholders, the company says it has largely been
left to run its own affairs since the acquisition.
But it admits that Sankyo Seiko continues to take a 'close interest' in its
direction.
Kozo Chiba, of Sankyo Seiko, will join the DAKS Simpson board replacing
Yasukazu Saito who retired as a director last month.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A P&amp;O company, BOVIS CONSTRUCTION, has won a Pounds 9m design and construct
contract for two lounge buildings, each of three storeys, to be built
alongside Pier 7 at Heathrow's Terminal 3 for Heathrow Airport Ltd.
The new lounge buildings will provide 86,000 sq ft of space. On the first
and second floors there will be 17 CIP (commercially important people)
lounges that will be leased to airlines operating out of Terminal 3.
The first and second floors will be equipped with duty-free shops and
toilets. The ground floor will be reserved for storage, aircraft servicing
facilities and security accommodation.
The flat roofed buildings, which will be located on the apron 'airside' of
the pier, will be steel framed with concrete and pre-cast plank flooring
with external cladding panels to match those on the existing Terminal 3.
One building will be supported on bored piles and will be completed by the
end of this year. The other building spans the route of the tunnel for the
proposed Paddington-Heathrow Express and for this reason is to be supported
on a concrete raft ring beam.

FT  15 JUN 92 / People: Mercury tries harder at unit trusts
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mercury Asset Management, one of the biggest and most aggressive London fund
managers, has poached Richard Royds, the 34-year-old managing director of
John Govett Unit Trusts, to head its own unit trust operation, one of the
weaker parts of MAM's business.
Royds, who will take over as managing director of Mercury Fund Managers in
early July, helps fill a gap at the top which has existed since James
Dawnay, 45, left to join Martin Currie Investment Management last November.
Dawnay was replaced as chairman of Mercury Fund Managers by David Rosier,
41, who will continue to hold this post in addition to his other
responsibilities. Nicholas Stewart, 37, the current managing director,
becomes vice chairman.
Royds' appointment is the clearest sign to date of MAM's intention of
beefing up its unit trust business, which has been overshadowed by its far
more successful pension fund management operation. Although MAM's unit
trusts have around Pounds 1.7bn of funds, and rank tenth in size in the
industry, this represents only a small part of a group which manages around
Pounds 40bn in total.
Whilst MAM's decision to look outside the group to strengthen its unit trust
team is no surprise, the choice of Royds may be. After a stint at Capital
Radio and the Media Shop, he is a relatively late entrant to the unit trust
game, only joining Wardley Unit Trust Managers in 1986 and John Govett in
1988.
While his rise has been rapid, the firm he comes from is hardly yet one of
the unit trust industry's great success stories. At the end of last year
Govett ranked 72nd in terms of the size of funds under management - although
chief executive Kevin Pakenham points out how ' a very successful year to
date' has achieved net sales of Pounds 40m plus, with notable successes in
selling innovative futures fund products.
'One of the great problems of the unit trust business is that it has tended
to recycle funds within the industry' according to Rosier. To attempt to
break that pattern, Mercury needs a much more diversified product range.
Meanwhile Pakenham says that Royds' departure ' leaves a 'personality', but
not necessarily a large 'business', gap.
*****
Richard Young is the new finance director of SUNLEIGH, the USM company which
has recently moved out of engineering and into leisure products. With the
switch - to PowaKaddy electronic golf trollies, Laser dinghies and Dart
catamarans - came a move of the company's headquarters from Yorkshire to
Maidenhead. The previous finance director was not prepared to come south,
opening up the opportunity for 46-year-old Taylor.
He has switched from the position of finance director at the UK subsidiary
of Crane Corporation, where the product range included pipe fittings, valves
and pumps. A chartered accountant, he spent 12 years with ITT in Brussels
and the rest of Continental Europe, before returning to the UK for a spell
with Sun Microsystems.

FT  15 JUN 92 / Management: Personality comes into fashion - What a woman
wears to work speaks volumes about her position and prospects in the
organisation / A guide to the distinctive wardrobe categories
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For most female managers Power Dressing is something of a joke, featuring
more in 1980s sex and shopping novels than in the boardroom. Even so, the
issue of appearance, and how women may use it to reinforce or undermine
their credibility, is increasingly being taken seriously by organisations
concerned with female potential at work.
One of the 'style consultants' these businesses are seeking out is Carolyn
Miller*, who has advised women on Cranfield School of Management courses and
at British Airways, Barclays Bank and BT.
A Miller session can be an unsettling experience and needs to be approached
with an open mind. Never since the parental comments of teenage days are
course members likely to have been subjected to such honest personal
assessments.
Miller's target number one is:
THE VICTIM DRESSER
By her appearance, the Victim is abdicating responsibility and saying to her
colleagues and superiors: 'I am not really here and I can only half do
things.' She could be destined to spend her working life behind the filing
cabinet and is unlikely to be picked for promotion.
This unfortunate specimen may be recognised, says Miller, by her
'poor-quality clothes, lack of make-up, little flat shoes and hair hanging
down over her face or tied back with an elastic band'.
THE TART
She is easily spotted, says Miller, in her 'dingly-dangly earrings, scent,
ultra high fashion clothes and electric blue mascara'. Like the Victim, she
will not be given responsibility: 'A tart would never be counted on - she
would leave you picking up the tab.'
Both the Victim and the Tart will be discriminated against, ignored and
patronised at work, Miller warns: 'They allow men to play their power games,
rather than dressing as men's equals.'
Anyone at a Miller session sitting in a neat navy suit, congratulating
themselves on having escaped the two previous stereotypes, could find
themselves the next target.
THE TOLERANCE DRESSER
She lives life as an obligation, bound in every direction by conformity.
Miller reserves a special depth of feeling for The Tolerance Dresser. 'It's
what gets out of the commuter trains and is the most insidious way of
being.' Clean, polished but unadorned and boring, the Tolerance Dresser
dresses out of a sense of obligation - for the tribe and not as an
individual.
Real power dressing is far from the jutting shoulder pads and drop-dead
suits of the 1980s. It comes through what Miller calls dressing 'Active
Participation'. This is achieved through a combination of quality, colour
and style.
The first is something that English women, according to Miller, are
particular bad at: 'They fritter their money away buying too many cheap
clothes.' They often fail, too, to dress their rank - Miller uses the
military term deliberately, seeing, for example, earrings as 'badges of
office' and necklaces as 'jugular protection'.
Colour 'shows you are alive, your heart is beating and you're not afraid to
be seen,' she says. Colour analysis is relatively familiar territory - a
number of companies offer to tell you whether you are an autumn, spring,
summer or winter person - and therefore which shades suit you best.
Miller has had politicians as her clients: Sir David Steel has been told to
wear longer trousers and cut down on the dark colours and large-striped
shirts; thanks to her, Ken Livingstone 'looks less like a salesman now,' she
says.
More unusual is Miller's method of helping clients arrive at a sense of
style. 'Dress who you are as well as what you are,' she instructs. To help
you find out who you are, she uses a personality test based on the Chinese
principles of Ying and Yang - the two supporting and opposing factors of the
universe. Sceptics may balk, yet Miller has claimed great success in sorting
women into a handful of wardrobe categories. Her basic types include:
DRAMATICS
'Witches and Darth Vaders' who need to dress in slightly wicked, tailored
clothes with strong, dark, contrasting colours, and bold patterns.
CLASSICS
Formal and territorial by nature, they are best suited to the polished, chic
look, upswept hair and medium-scaled jewellery.
NATURALS
At the other extreme, these 'pirates, gypsies and ragamuffins' can wear long
skirts, flowing scarves, blended and muted colours, looser hairstyles.
GAMINES
Miller describes these as fun, creative and very stubborn, who come into
their own in neat, sharp clothes. They can wear primary colours, shorter
skirts, coloured tights, pump shoes and boxy jackets.
INGENUES
'Princesses and fair maidens, a very English look' - who suit feminine,
small-scale patterns, pearls and mid-tone colours.
ROMANTICS
This last type are 'starlets, poets, entertainers and tarts with hearts of
gold'. The Romantic should go for glamorous clothes and steer clear of
checks, stripes and a masculine tailored look. This type can get away with
diamonds before six, says Miller, noting that not many Romantics are to be
found anywhere near the average office.
To those women who remain unconvinced that any of this really matters -
particularly not for work - Miller points out that work 'is what pays the
mortgage and supports your lifestyle'. Work deserves the best, if only out
of good manners, she says: 'If I'm paying to see a solicitor, I want her to
look as if she's enjoying her job. I don't want her to look as though she'd
rather be at home doing the gardening.'

The lady on the right is wearing a designer number. Slabs of red and black
are stitched into a fitted jacket, teamed with a sleek black skirt. Her
companion sports a blue suit, tailored and demure, set off by a plain white
blouse and pearls.
It is eight in the morning and the early arrivals are rolling into Goldman
Sachs, one of New York's leading investment banks. Stereotypical Wall Street
dressing dominates the scene. Hair is neat but unadventurous. Nails are
painted in discreet shades of pink. Skirts ride a maximum two inches above
the knee. Shoulder-pads are de rigueur. The only jarring note is the running
shoes - every New Yorker's standard outdoor wear. But these will be swapped
for court shoes, once Manhattan's grubby pavements give way to Goldman's
polished floors.
'The women executives are very well-made, and it's not as if they lose their
sexuality,' says one 'resting' actress, now temping on Wall Street. 'I think
it's a matter of individual taste, so long as it's professional', says
Katherine Bristor, at one of the largest New York law firms. 'Some women
here wear pants, some wear a very masculine tailored look.'
Even this, she admits, marks a recent change. 'When I started at the
practice, I felt more constrained . . . but now there are more women
around.'
On the west coast, Charmaine McClarie-Cox, who runs an image consultancy,
agrees things are changing and recession means services have to be sold
harder. 'Your marketing has to be better-honed.' she argues. 'How you dress
for Chevron, say, is not how you dress if you want to win over a small
businessman. You don't want to look like the FBI.'
So what adjustment does she advise? 'Stand out while fitting in,' seems to
be the message. 'If it's a navy blue suit, find an interesting stripe. Add
more touches of colour. After all, if you play it too safe, you don't say
anything, except that you're scared.'
An article on the clothes men wear will appear shortly.

FT  15 JUN 92 / Management: Designer-clad career women put on the style in
Paris
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Some Anglo-Saxon phenomena are acceptable in France. Others are not. The
'style consultant' is definitely in the latter category. France is, after
all, a country where eight-year-old girls are dispatched to the local ecole
de beaute to learn how to apply make-up in their school holidays, where
Chanel is a national institution, and where taxi drivers can tell at a
glance not only what you are wearing but how much you paid for it.
Whereas high-powered women in the US and UK tend to worry that, if they look
good, they will not be taken seriously, French women know that they are
expected to be both intelligent and personable.
Edith Cresson, fresh from her short career as France's first woman prime
minister, once said it would be impossible for a woman to succeed in French
politics unless she was attractive. Cresson herself appeared day after day
smiling for the TV cameras with well-coiffed hair, clad in signature high
heels and a suit from Torrente, her favourite couturier.
You only have to glance at the designer-suited career women poring over
their power breakfasts in the Louis XVI restaurant of the Hotel de Crillon,
or at the women cabinet ministers perching on their gilt chairs at the Paris
haute couture shows to realise that Cresson is not an exception.
French working women may be better dressed than their British counterparts,
but they are no less conservative in taste. It is only in the Paris art
scene or the media that you see women wearing the seriously fashionable
clothes of funky young designers. Otherwise, one label dominates the power
wardrobes of Paris - Chanel.
The classic Chanel suit, complete with short skirt and snappy jacket with
shiny buttons, is the uniform for French working women. It is a sell-out in
Paris season after season. The career women who are not (yet) quite high
powered enough to afford anything from Pounds 1,250 for an original go to
one of the dozens of dressmakers who make a living churning out copies.

RESULTS DUE
BET, the business services conglomerate, is likely to report pre-tax profits
sharply down today at about Pounds 110m after an extremely tough year in
joinery, personnel and plant hire. The market is expecting a halved full
year dividend of about 6.25p, just covered by earnings. It is likely to be
surprised by exceptional charges that could be as much as double the level
analysts had been expecting.
The results season for the electricity utilities begins in earnest with
three of the regional supply companies and one generator set to report
substantially increased profits. Today, analysts expect East Midlands
Electricity to announce a historic cost pre-tax profit of around Pounds
145m, up 37 per cent. Norweb, expected to show the biggest rise in profits
of the 12 regional companies, reports tomorrow. Its profit is expected to
more than double to Pounds 128m. On the same day, National Power, the
largest privatised generator, should announce a profit of around Pounds
510m, from Pounds 434m last year. On Thursday, Manweb's profit is expected
to increase by around 75 per cent to Pounds 95m.
As the reporting season for the privatised water and sewage companies
trundles on, Severn Trent is the only company to announce this week, and is
expected to reveal on Thursday a 6 per cent increase in pre-tax profits to
Pounds 263m for the year to 31 March. Although profits from water and sewage
are expected to be well ahead, attention will focus on Biffa, the waste
management company acquired last year from BET for Pounds 212m.
Hazlewood Foods, the Derby-based food manufacturer, is expected to reveal
flat profits of between Pounds 50m-Pounds 52m for the year to March 31 in
its results tomorrow. This is despite the Pounds 34.7m agreed offer for its
rival Sutherland at the end of July. The group had a tough second half - hit
by pricing pressure from the multiples and Dutch problems.
Cable and Wireless, the UK-based international telecommunications group, is
expected to announce on Wednesday that pre-tax profits for the year end to
March increased from Pounds 609m to Pounds 640. But a higher tax charge is
likely to be primarily responsible for a fall in earnings per share to
around 29.8p from 31.3p the previous year.

FT  15 JUN 92 / Economics: Looking for 'green shoot' indicators of UK
recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A HOST of indicators on the the UK economy will be released this week.
Evidence of economic recovery is still thin so the figures - in particular
data on industrial production, retail sales, and unemployment - will be
scrutinised for signs of 'green shoots'.
After May's sunny beginning there were high expectations for the month's
retail sales, but reports from individual retailers suggest that the
half-hearted post-election spending spree dwindled last month.
There are higher hopes for manufacturing output, which has risen for two
consecutive months. On a three-monthly trend basis the decline in output
appears to be over and the forecast is for another modest rise.
The following are some of the other economic highlights and events of the
week. The figures in brackets are the median of City economists' forecasts,
from MMS International: Today: UK, first quarter balance of payments (Pounds
2.1bn deficit); France, May consumer prices index (up 0.3 per cent on month,
up 3.2 per cent on year); US, auto sales June 1-10; Canada, April wage
settlement increases (up 2.6 per cent); Australia, April housing finance (up
5 per cent); Switzerland, Bank of International Settlements AGM in Basel;
Luxembourg, EC General Affairs Council meets to discuss 1993-97 budget.
Tomorrow: UK, May PSBR (Pounds 4bn); US, May housing starts (1.17m), May
building permits, May industrial production (up 0.5 per cent); May capacity
utilisation (79 per cent), first quarter current account; Canada, March
leading indicator (flat), April manufacturing unfilled orders (flat); Japan,
industrial production.
Wednesday: UK, May retail sales (up 0.2 per cent on month, up 1.5 per cent
on year), April industrial production (up 0.6 per cent), April manufacturing
output (up 0.2 per cent on month, down 0.5 per cent on year); US, first
quarter productivity; Canada, first quarter manufacturing capacity
utilisation (71 per cent); US, Fed releases Tan Book for June 30 FOMC.
Thursday: UK, May unemployment (up 30,000), April average earnings (7.25 per
cent), April unit wage costs (4.2 per cent), May M0 (down 0.2 per cent on
month, up 2.1 per cent on year), May M4 (up 0.4 per cent on month, up 5.4
per cent on year), May M4 lending (up Pounds 2.5bn); US, initial claims for
week ended June 6 (400,000), April merchandise trade balance (Dollars 5.5bn
deficit), exports (Dollars 37.3bn), imports (Dollars 42.7bn), money supply
data for week ended June 8; Canada, April merchandise exports (up 0.55 per
cent), imports (up 0.2 per cent), trade surplus (Dollars 1bn); Ireland,
referendum on ratification of Maastricht treaty; Europe, markets closed:
Dusseldorf, Munich, Stuttgart and Frankfurt and in Austria and Portugal.
Friday: UK, CBI monthly industrial trends; France, April industrial

deficit); Canada, May CPI (up 0.4 per cent); Sweden, markets closed.
During the week: Germany, May producer prices index (up 0.3 per cent on
month, up 2.1 per cent on year), May M3 from fourth quarter base (up 8.5 per
cent); Italy, April wholesale prices index (up 1.8 per cent on year), April
producer prices index (up 1.6 per cent on year), April industrial production
(up 3 per cent on year); Netherlands, April trade balance; Denmark, May CPI

FT  15 JUN 92 / Support for flexible pension age
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A FLEXIBLE rather than a common fixed pension age for men and women is
favoured by 60 per cent of managers, according to a British Institute of
Management survey published today.
The finding will add to pressure on the government to move from its position
of favouring a fixed age. Under a fixed plan, the age women would become
eligible for a state pension would rise from 60 to either 63 or 65 - the
current pension age for men.
Of those managers surveyed who wanted a flexible approach to retirement,
three-quarters favoured a scheme which would enable people to claim a larger
state pension the later they retired.
One in six wanted a split scheme under which part of the state pension would
be payable at 60 and the rest at 65.
Of 3,000 BIM members surveyed, 330 responded.

FT  15 JUN 92 / Venture capitalists launch value study
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE venture-capital industry is to carry out a pilot study aimed at
gathering the first reliable statistics on the performance of its
investments.
The move is in response to pressure from institutional investors
disappointed with the industry's poorer-than-expected performance and
concerned to see they get value for money.
The British Venture Capital Association will gather performance data on
investments by six of its members. A project team will gather information on
the performance of individual investments to see whether a common pattern
emerges from investments made in a particular year or in a particular type
of deal. It may also look at the returns from investments in particular
industries.
But the data will not be used to compare the performance of different funds,
a prospect which worries many venture capitalists. Nor will it reveal the
return to investors from particular investments, because different funds
levy different fees and charges before passing on profits to investors.
Mr Robert Drummond, chairman of the association and managing director of
Grosvenor Venture Managers, said: 'My hope is that the data will allow us to
explain to the world where we are successful and get away from a
concentration on the deals which have run into problems such as the buy-outs
of MFI, Magnet or Isosceles' The pilot project is also intended to establish
a standardised method of assessing the return on venture-capital
investments. It comes two years after the association agreed common
guidelines on valuing investments, although these rules still leave room for
variation.
The venture-capital association is to begin a review of its valuation
guidelines with the aim of simplifying them.
The results of the study are expected to be available early next year.

FT  15 JUN 92 / Managing agents' rules eased by Lloyd's
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LLOYD'S of London, the troubled insurance market, has lifted the requirement
that managing agents must obtain insurance against negligence claims.
But managing agents who do not have cover are unlikely to be able to attract
new business, and the move is seen as hastening the shake-out of weaker
managing agents.
Lloyd's Names - whose private wealth stands behind insurance claims - are
unlikely to wish to place business with underwriters who in effect cannot be
sued for negligence.
Claims against so-called 'errors and omissions' policies have soared in the
past 18 months and premiums for that type of insurance have become a
significant part of managing agents' costs. Managing agents manage
underwriting syndicates.
Mr Dick Hazell, Lloyd's deputy chairman, said last week in a letter to Names
that 'severe difficulties have been experienced in establishing a viable
market for such insurance this year and it seems likely that the situation
may be even more uncertain next year'.
Mr Hazell acknowledged that removal of the mandatory requirement for errors
and omissions insurance could cause 'understandable concern'. However, he
said that Lloyd's Council would continue to monitor underwriting agents to
see that they met the required standards and this will take into account the
extent to which they voluntarily purchased such insurance.

FT  15 JUN 92 / Tax risk for Australian inflation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SYDNEY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AUSTRALIA'S struggle against inflation is likely to be undermined over the
next year by tax increases planned by state governments in defiance of
federal government calls for restraint.
New South Wales and Victoria, the two biggest states, plan significant
increases in taxes on beer, tobacco, petrol and financial transactions,
together with increases in charges for state transport services.
South Australia has also indicated that it is considering raising taxes and
charges, and other states are likely to follow suit if slow economic growth
continues to worsen their budgetary problems.
The increases follow the completion of the annual financial assistance
agreement between the states and territories and the federal government,
which determines the size of federal grants.
This year's agreement provides for an increase in total grants of 5.9 per
cent to ADollars 28.4bn (Pounds 11.9bn), together with a 10 per cent
increase in the states' aggregate borrowing limit to ADollars 4.2bn.
Mr Paul Keating, the Labor prime minister, said the agreement would provide
the first real increase in financial assistance since the mid-1980s, when
the federal government began cutting transfers to balance its own budget.
Mr Keating also extracted an undertaking that the states and territories
would avoid increases in taxes and charges to avoid raising inflation from
the current low level of 1.5 per cent.
However, the agreement failed to resolve a long-running dispute over the
mechanism used to determine grants to individual states and territories,
which discriminates against the larger states.
Mrs Joan Kirner, the Labor premier of Victoria, said she had agreed with Mr
Nick Greiner, the Liberal premier of New South Wales, that increases in
taxes and charges were inevitable to avoid significant cuts in services.
Mr Greiner said the increases in New South Wales alone would add 0.5-0.7
percentage points to inflation, which had been expected to remain below 2
per cent for the rest of the calendar year.

FT  15 JUN 92 / Thai PM calls in former colleagues for cabinet
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTOR MALLET
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BANGKOK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Anand Panyarachun, Thailand's interim prime minister, yesterday unveiled
a new cabinet, whose main aims will be to restore confidence in the economy
after last month's killings of pro-democracy demonstrators and to prepare
for new elections within four months.
Most of the 26 cabinet members served in Mr Anand's previous government
between the military coup d'etat in February 1991 and the elections in March
this year, although the prime minister was unable to persuade Mr Suthee
Singhasaneh, his choice for the finance portfolio, to take the job.
'Mr Suthee has been in the job for different governments over the past 10
years and he is over 60,' Mr Anand said. The new finance minister is Mr
Panas Simasathien, 59, a US-educated career civil servant who was permanent
secretary in the same ministry.
For the sensitive post of interior minister - the official charged with
organising the new election in a country noted for its corrupt electoral
practices - Mr Anand chose police General Pow Sarasin. He is a member of one
of Thailand's most influential families and at one time was in charge of the
fight against drugs. His brother Arsa Sarasin returns as foreign minister.
Mr Anand was named prime minister by King Bhumipol in a surprise edict last
week to replace the unpopular Gen Suchinda Kraprayoon, who was forced to
resign after the violence last month.
The new premier chose Gen Banchob Bunnag, an uncontroversial retired army
chief of staff, as his defence minister. 'He had a good record in the army,
with no doubtful past, politically or militarily,' said Mr Anand. 'No
involvement in any violent crackdowns, either the recent or earlier ones.'
Foreign investors and the local business community praised the liberalising
economic reforms carried out by the previous Anand administration, and they
are likely to welcome the familiar faces in his cabinet after the turmoil of
the last two months. The ministers of commerce, industry, transport and
communications and agriculture are the same as before.
Thais will now have to wait anxiously to see whether the humiliated military
leaders continue to keep a low profile, and whether the elections will
produce a government which is both acceptable to the demonstrators who
defeated Gen Suchinda and economically competent.

FT  15 JUN 92 / Israel to rent out surplus apartments
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   JERUSALEM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Israeli government yesterday decided to rent out thousands of the
surplus apartments it holds as a result of over-estimating immigrant demand
to purchase, writes Hugh Carnegy in Jerusalem. In doing so it has ignored
arguments from the Bank of Israel that the move runs contrary to a pressing
need to reduce the state's role in the economy.
The cabinet voted to make more than 4,600 of some 12,000 empty units
available for rent to the poor and the elderly.
Under the pressure of mass immigration from the former Soviet Union, the
government ordered thousands of apartments to be built in outlying areas,
with a guaranteed buy-back clause. But immigrants' unwillingess to take on
even subsidised mortgages in areas without jobs, and a decline in the rate
of immigration, has left the Housing Ministry facing a loss estimated at up
to Dollars 1bn (Pounds 543m).

FT  15 JUN 92 / The Earth Summit: Looking to life after Rio
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHAT happens now that Rio is over?
The summit's main legacy will be a Sustainable Development Commission to
monitor countries' record on environmental protection, and apply 'peer group
pressure' to those who lag behind. This will be similar to the Human Rights
Commission established under the auspices of the UN.
Precise details will be worked out later this year, but the commission will
probably have 50 members drawn from various governments, and will be closely
linked to the scientific and non-governmental communities. It will report
through the economic and social committee (Ecosoc) to the general assembly.
The commission would operate on the basis of reports submitted by member
countries.
Other machinery set in motion in Rio includes the secretariats of the two
treaties that were signed here by over 150 countries on climate change and
bio-diversity protection. These would have the job of organising periodic
reviews.
Will there ever be another Earth Summit? Exhausted delegates doubted it
yesterday. But President Mitterrand of France departed with the suggestion
that there be another 'rendez-vous' in three to five years.

FT  15 JUN 92 / The Earth Summit: Brazil reaps huge aid reward
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTINA LAMB
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   RIO DE JANEIRO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FOR Brazil, the Earth Summit was perhaps the best investment the country has
ever made. Its outlay as host in readying the city of Rio to receive 30,000
visitors has brought a large dividend.
Over the 12 days of the conference Brazil has gained more in bilateral and
multilateral aid commitments than at any time in the past decade and more
than the rest of money pledged for new world aid.
The Japanese government has agreed Dollars 1.1bn (Pounds 600m) in
concessionary loans through its Overseas Export Credit Fund - its first
lending to Brazil for seven years and around half the new Overseas
Development Aid it has pledged in Rio for environmental projects worldwide.
Germany has pledged Dollars 300m to Brazil in concessional aid. The
Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) has agreed to release Dollars 1bn and
the World Bank is to increase its lending from Dollars 700m last year to
Dollars 1.08bn. The heads of the World Bank, IDB, and International Monetary
Fund each promised between Dollars 350m and Dollars 400m as initial
collateral in Brazil's current negotiations on its commercial debt.
The total in new aid for this year could reach Dollars 4bn - compared with
what appears to be only Dollars 2.5bn (the numbers are vague) pledged for
environmental projects worldwide by leaders of industrialised nations at the
summit.
The direct cost of the summit to Brazil was about Dollars 37m.
'The returns have been very good,' said Mr Marcilio Marques Moreira,
Brazil's economy minister. Although much of the money was for projects
already under negotiation, he said the Earth Summit had provided the
impetus. 'First of all everyone was here and it gave us chance to speak to
heads of state and of multilateral institutions directly; secondly everyone
wanted to sign things here.'

FT  15 JUN 92 / Former Carrian chief to reappear in court
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON HOLBERTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Hong Kong government will tomorrow make its second attempt to gain a
conviction against Mr George Tan, former chairman of the failed Carrian
property and shipping group.
Mr Tan will be brought before the colony's district court to answer eight
charges of bribery. The case will be heard by a judge alone.
Mr Tan is alleged to have paid HKDollars 4.8m (Pounds 338,000) in bribes to
executives of WestLB Asia Ltd and HKDollars 888,000 in bribes and shares to
one executive of Barclays Asia Ltd during 1981 and 1982.
The executive of Barclays, Mr Stuart Turner, pleaded guilty in 1988 to
accepting the bribe and 668,000 shares from Mr Tan. The two WestLB Asia
executives have also pleaded guilty.
The government's attempts to gain a conviction against Mr Tan were
frustrated in 1987 when a judge dismissed charges against him of conspiring
to defraud shareholders. Charges against his auditors, Price Waterhouse, for
false accounting were also dismissed.
The judge, who resigned six months after his controversial ruling, ended
Hong Kong's longest trial after 281 days and a cost to the colony's
exchequer of more than HKDollars 27m.
The colonial government has another case pending against Mr Tan. This is
dependent, however, on the extradition from Britain of Mr Lorrain Osman,
former chairman of Bumiputra Malaysia Finance, a Hong Kong-based subsidiary
of the state-owned Bank Bumiputra, who has been fighting extradition for the
past 6 1/2 years.
Mr Osman, who is the longest serving prisoner on remand in Britain, last
Thursday lost his seventh attempt to have his extradition quashed.
If returned to Hong Kong, Mr Osman will face 42 fraud and corruption charges
connected with HKDollars 6bn on loans made by his company to Carrian.
Carrian was put into liquidation in October 1983 with debts estimated at
more than HKDollars 10bn. The biggest lender to the company was Bumiputra
Malaysia Finance.
Hongkong and Shanghai Bank also lost an undisclosed sum and its subsidiary,
Wardley, was placed under new management.

<TEXT>
THE Bank for International Settlements is making a subtle change to the
proceedings of its annual meeting in Basle today. The national flags of
Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia will be flying outside the bank's headquarters
in Basle, alongside those of the BIS's other 29 shareholder central banks.
The Baltic states are returning to take up their seats in the 'central
bankers' bank' for the first time since their annexation by the Soviet Union
in 1940.
Membership of the central bankers' 'club' represents a landmark in the three
states' drive to regain sovereignty. The national banks of Latvia, Lithuania
and Estonia joined the BIS when it was set up in 1930 to help organise
payment of Germany's First World War reparations. They routinely deposited
part of their gold reserves with the BIS, which held the bullion in New
York.
The BIS never recognised the Soviet takeovers, either de facto or de jure.
In contrast to Sweden and Britain, which in 1940 and 1968 respectively
transferred or sold Baltic gold as part of agreements with the Soviet Union,
the BIS maintained the Baltic states' bullion deposits intact during the
whole period after 1940 despite repeated Soviet claims that the gold
belonged to Moscow.
The Baltic assets held with the BIS, along with the three states' other
reconstituted pre-war gold holdings, now make up the lion's share of their
monetary reserves. Britain and Sweden this year both agreed to pay back to
the Baltic states gold deposited in1940.
Britain repaid the gold in March, while Sweden will probably make its own
restitution soon.
The overall importance of the Baltic states' return to the BIS fold is
considerably greater than their actual stakes in the institution. Latvia,
Lithuania and Estonia own between them a mere 2,200 shares in the BIS -
giving them stakes of 0.2, 0.2 and 0.04 per cent respectively.
The BIS was not the only bank which succeeded in hanging on to Baltic gold
in the post-war era. The Bank of France held small amounts of Baltic gold -
1 tonne for Latvia, and 2.3 tonnes for Lithuania. But the French managed to
keep the Baltic gold from both Germany and the Soviet Union during the war
because stocks were sent to Africa for safekeeping. In contrast to the Bank
of England and the Swedish Riksbank, the Bank of France could point out that
it had been a little more successful in conserving customers' deposits
during a stormy half- century.

Fierce fighting raged over the weekend on the eastern borders of Nagorno
Karabakh, the Armenian-dominated enclave within Azerbaijan, as both Azeri
and Karabakh forces attacked and captured villages, mostly outside of
Karabakh's frontiers, writes John Lloyd in Moscow.
It is the first serious fighting since Karabakh and Armenian forces drove a
corridor between the enclave's western borders and Armenia after expelling
Azeri troops from strongholds inside Karabakh.
An Azeri offensive along the eastern Karabakh front on Armenian-held
villages outside the enclave's borders appears to have been a success
initially.  However, a counter-offensive yesterday was said by the Karabakh
self-defence headquarters to have succeeded in recapturing some of the 15
villages claimed to have been taken by the Azeris.

FT  15 JUN 92 / Russian military 'seeks permanent Baltic presence'
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
LEADERS in the Baltic states believe the Russian military wants to keep
former Soviet troops on their territories indefinitely because it regards
these small independent states as vital to Russia's security.
Lithuania, largest of the three states, yesterday held a referendum on the
presence of the 35,000 Russian troops there. A big vote demanding withdrawal
was certain.
The issue threatens to become a source of serious tension and instability in
the region - though there are signs that some of the Baltic leaders favour a
compromise.
Mr Audrius Butkevicius, the Lithuanian defence minister, said last week he
had been told by a senior Russian general that Russia intended to treat the
external Baltic borders as its own. The Russian military has been concerned,
since the break-up of the Soviet Union, that it is vulnerable to attack
through the Baltics, which it would like to see as forming a kind of buffer
zone.
Mr Butkevicius said that in a meeting last Wednesday with Col Gen
Kalininchenko, head of the border guards for the Commonwealth of Independent
States (of which none of the Baltic states is a member), he had been told:
'The Polish- Lithuanian border is seen as our (Russian) border and our
soldiers are there to defend the interests of Russia.' Lithuania is the only
Baltic state which shares a western border with a central European state.
The minister said Gen Kalininchenko justified his position by reference to a
border treaty between the Soviet Union and the Polish People's Republic -
both states which have been succeeded by different state entities.
He said he did not expect any change in the Russian position after the
meeting nine days ago between Lithuanian President Vytautas Landsbergis and
Russian President Boris Yeltsin - after which Mr Yeltsin was reported as
promising to 'do his best' to speed the withdrawal of troops.
A document revealed to the Baltic press by Mr Endel Lipmaa, an Estonian
negotiator with the Russians on troop withdrawal, shows the Russians regard
the Baltics in a category of countries described as 'ours'. The Russian
position paper suggests Russian troops remain, paid for by the Baltic states
in return for security. The Russians say the paper is just a draft.
Estonia, with a Russian population of between 35 and 40 per cent, has been
the most unyielding on the demand that the troops must leave by the end of
the year. Its foreign minister, Mr Jan Manitsky, called on Saturday for
'large scale international support' to force out the Russian troops.
However, Mr Landsbergis appeared to have softened his parallel demand in
talks with Mr Yeltsin, proposing that the pull-out could be delayed until
next year; while Mr Janis Jurkans, the Latvian foreign minister, last week
warned against pushing Russia too far on the issue because of the
'fragility' of its democratic institutions.

FT  15 JUN 92 / The European Market: German construction companies prepare
for rebuilding of the east - Best growth prospects are beyond W Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ACQUISITIONS in western Europe no longer feature on Bilfinger + Berger's
list of priorities, Mr Christian Roth, chairman, said this month. That side
of the business - and the continent - is adequately covered already. B+B,
Germany's third largest construction company, recently tied up a
collaboration package with France's Fougerolle, completing a round of
strategic deals which have covered most of the gaps in the Community market.
Philipp Holzmann, market leader with DM11bn (Pounds 3.7bn) sales, is in a
similar position, It has, for example, a 30 per cent stake in Britain's
Tilbury Douglas and control of Nord-France.
For the present, most attention is focused on long-term prospects in the
east rather than on the slender short-term possibilities of the looming EC
single market. As Mr Hermann Becker, Holzmann's chairman and leader of the
HDB industry association, pointed out last month, the Community construction
market is in a rut. Growth can be expected this year only in Germany and,
thanks to government-funded infrastructural work, Portugal.
While total EC investment in building this year is expected to stick at
about DM1,300bn, commercial construction will be down more than 5 per cent
and member states' budget restrictions have in effect stopped growth in
public works. New EC housing output is forecast to fall 0.5 per cent, and
the only consolation lies in an expected 2.4 per cent rise in the market for
apartment and house refurbishment.
While German builders talk of 'stagnation' this year, they are careful to
point out that the plateau on which they find themselves stands far above
the business landscape in neighbouring community countries. They have shared
handsomely in the boom which has carried German industry upwards since the
late 1980s. Latest figures for B+B, for example, showed a further 20 per
cent increase in sales and a 38 per cent rise in pre-tax profits for 1991.
Holzmann's turnover rose 18 per cent. Holzmann's profits performance, which
is not yet available, is unlikely to be quite so strong because the group
depends on markets abroad for 47 per cent of its business, compared with
B+B's 36 per cent.
Now, while other German industries are mourning the demise of the
post-unification boom - demand for cars and other consumer goods is tailing
off in the former GDR - builders are starting to enjoy properly the benefits
of rebuilding eastern Germany from the drains upwards. New estimates say
there is DM2,000bn-worth of work to be done before eastern housing,
factories, roads, railways and environmental services match those in the
west. Political necessity, according to Chancellor Helmut Kohl, demands that
it is done quickly to prevent westwards migration, or even social unrest.
Despite the presence of foreign companies such as RMC and Tarmac, German
builders have the market pretty much to themselves.
As public spending is squeezed in the west of the country and all available
funds are transferred to the five new states, so the construction industry
refocuses its attention - Philipp Holzmann alone has bought 40 east German
companies in the past two years - and looks beyond to the underdeveloped
infrastructures in Poland, Hungary and Czechoslovakia.
Politicians talk of future EC membership for them, but German builders,
working closely with industry and governments in Warsaw and Prague, have
already redrawn the maps. They show pencilled-in lines criss-crossing
Czechoslovakia and Poland, delineating projects, including all new road and
rail connections sweeping from Frankfurt an der Oder to Warsaw and beyond.
New stretches of rail will connect Stuttgart directly with the Polish
capital, passing through Prague and Wroclaw.
Germany's expectations are as high as the planned links are long. Starting
with the advantages of geographical position and cultural and linguistic
links, the building industry has moved speedily to implant itself in new
markets where the domestic competition is still inexperienced, suffering
from lack of up-to-date know-how and relatively thin on the ground.
Of the 11 joint ventures in building materials and construction established
in Czechoslovakia last year, seven were initiated by west German concerns.
Foreign investors, again led by Germany, spent Koruna26bn (Pounds 500m) in
the first wave of privatisations in the sector. All they need now is the
forecast upswing in the market.
The signs of recovery - estimated growth of 3 or 4 per cent this year
following a 30 per cent nosedive in 1991 - are already there. Meanwhile,
thousands of Czechoslovakia's skilled building workers are being kept
occupied and trained in the German way among the 55,000 east Europeans
currently employed on the federal republic's unique pilot project:
rebuilding the former GDR.

PROGRESSIVE Insurance Company, the Ohio-based insurer which specialises in
non-standard private passenger car coverage, has agreed to pay Dollars 51.2m
(Pounds 28.1m) in rebates to Californian motor vehicle insurance
policyholders.
The agreement represents further progress for Mr John Garamendi, the
Californian Insurance Commissioner, as he struggles to implement Proposition
103, the state's voter initiative which was passed in 1988.
Prop 103 called for rate rollbacks based on the profitability of car
insurers operating in the states. However, the insurance companies quickly
mounted formidable legal opposition to its provisions, and implementation of
Prop 103 led to a tangled courtroom battle. Progressive is only the third
big insurer to agree to pay out Prop 103 rebates. The others are Auto Club
of Southern California and Mercury Insurance.
Progressive's pay-out will be shared among 260,000 policyholders, providing
them with an average cheque of Dollars 200 apiece. The California Insurance
Department also said that the insurer had agreed to make future rate
reductions for certain private passenger lines and coverages, and to freeze
any rate increases for 12 months.
Progressive's shares were suspended in New York on Friday at Dollars 52 1/4.

FT  15 JUN 92 / Clinton criticises black 'racism'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GOVERNOR Bill Clinton has sharply attacked a black popular singer for
inciting racial prejudice in the US, thus incurring the displeasure of the
country's most prominent black leader, the Rev Jesse Jackson.
The presumptive Democratic presidential candidate took what appears to be a
calculated political gamble in a Washington speech at a meeting of the
Rainbow Coalition, Mr Jackson's own political organisation.
He said Sister Souljah, the black rap singer who had addressed the meeting
the previous night, was on record as saying after the Los Angeles riots that
blacks could be justified in killing whites and that whites had 'a low-down
dirty nature'.
'If you took the words 'white' and 'black' and reversed them, you might
think David Duke was giving that speech,' he said in a reference to the
fringe right-wing politician who performed dismally in a bid for the
Republican nomination this year.
'We have an obligation, all of us, to call attention to prejudice wherever
we see it,' he said. He admired the Rainbow Coalition's determination 'to
come together across racial lines' but felt Sister Souljah's comments ran
counter to that spirit, as had his own admitted mistake of playing golf at a
segregated country club.
Mr Jackson accused Mr Clinton of 'bad judgment' and said the singer deserved
an apology.
The campaigns of both Mr Clinton and President George Bush have been
debating how best to respond to the new political challenges posed by Mr
Ross Perot, the prospective independent candidate.
An option for both is to appeal more openly to their respective liberal and
conservative constituencies, on the grounds that in a close three-way race,
secure natural political bases will be more important than ever.
This explains why Vice-President Dan Quayle has been dispatched to
conservative audiences to attack the liberal values and cultural elitism of
the media. He is also being deployed as the main Republican critic of Mr
Perot.
Mr Clinton, however, is known to believe that excessive reliance on
traditional Democratic constituencies - especially minorities and organised
labour - would be a recipe for failure. His campaign throughout has been
predicated on the need to win back middle-class Americans, mostly white, who
voted Republican in the last three elections, while not sacrificing the
progressive base.
At his press conference last Friday he denied there was tactical division
among his staff on the issue.
Yet his cause would undoubtedly be weakened if the black vote were lost.
Neither Mr Bush nor Mr Perot is popular among blacks, but the critical
question is whether they vote in sufficient numbers to help Mr Clinton.
For that to happen it is axiomatic that he needs the support of leaders like
Mr Jackson.

FT  15 JUN 92 / Airbus fears conflicts of interest: Partners seeking joint
ventures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS, Aerospace Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BERLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Airbus partners risk creating conflicts of interest by negotiating with
Japanese and US aerospace companies a number of ventures which could
undermine the European aircraft manufacturing consortium, according to
Airbus and other European aerospace industry officials at the Berlin air
show.
This follows a series of separate ventures currently being negotiated by the
partners with other international aerospace companies.
Deutsche Aerospace, a 37.9 per cent partner in Airbus, is expected to
announce at the Berlin air show today an agreement to exchange engineers
with Boeing, the consortium's main US competitor.
The German company is also in advanced negotiations to acquire a controlling
stake in Fokker, the Dutch regional aircraft maker. It proposes to create a
new European regional aircraft partnership with Fokker, Aerospatiale, the
French Airbus partner, and Alenia, the Italian aerospace company.
This proposed venture plans to develop a range of jets which could compete
on some markets with Airbus' own planned A319, a 125-seat derivative of its
150-seat A320 jet.
British Aerospace, which holds 20 per cent of Airbus, is also negotiating
with the big three Japanese manufacturers (Kawasaki Heavy Industries,
Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, and Fuji Heavy Industries) a possible Japanese
partnership in BAe's loss-making regional aircraft operations.
Airbus is worried BAe's talks with Japan could have an impact on the
consortium's own efforts to establish a partnership with the three Japanese
companies in the research and development of a new 600-800-seat jumbo
aircraft.
It fears the Japanese could eventually use any co-operation in regional
aircraft with a European partner as an excuse to opt out of serious
discussion on collaboration with Airbus on a new jumbo, leaving the field to
Boeing, which is co-operating with the Japanese on its new 777 wide-body
airliner, and studying the development of a 600-800-seat jumbo.
McDonnell Douglas, the other main commercial airliner maker, is trying to
negotiate a partnership with Taiwan to launch a new jumbo, the MD12.
Although the Deutsche Aerospace agreement with Boeing is limited at this
stage to the exchange of engineers between the two companies, the German
group appears interested in exploring possible collaboration with the US
manufacturer in both the supersonic and the 600-800-seat, sub-sonic jumbo
airliner field.
While this could lead to a clash with Airbus' own jumbo project, it could
also open the way for broader co-operation among Europeans, Americans and
Japanese in the very large airliner sector. Such co-operation has already
been agreed in principle in the studies for the development of a
second-generation supersonic aircraft.
However, most industry observers regard it highly unlikely, at this state at
least, that Airbus and Boeing will work together.
The two groups did try to co-operate in 1976 on the BB10 project to build a
new wide-body airliner, with Airbus providing the wide fuselage and Boeing
the wings. The project collapsed and Airbus went ahead on its own to develop
what became the A310 wide-body airliner.
Airbus also tried on three occasions, unsuccessfully, to co-operate with
McDonnell Douglas.

FT  15 JUN 92 / Survey of Greece (9): Quest for greater independence -
Profile of Eftyhia Pylarinou, ETVA governor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KERIN HOPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MRS Eftyhia Pylarinou, the governor of the Hellenic Industrial Development
Bank (ETVA), took on a more difficult task than the many other younger Greek
bankers who returned home from jobs abroad to help modernise the state-owned
banks.
All the Greek state banks have a large backlog of non-performing loans, as
well as equity stakes in heavily indebted companies, now being privatised.
But as a development bank tied to implementing the government's industrial
policy for more than 20 years, ETVA is saddled with a depressingly large
number of unprofitable companies.
ETVA controls 20 industrial companies and holds minority stakes in about 100
others, from mineral extraction and processing operations to hotels,
shipping and textile factories.
Mrs Pylarinou, who worked in New York for 12 years, first at Bank Leumi and
then at the First New York Bank for Business, initially felt hemmed in by
the network of committees which make decision-making in the state sector a
frustratingly long drawn-out process.
She says: 'Privatisation is slowed down by bureaucracy and there are a great
many legal obstacles to overcome. But we have to sell all these companies if
we're to get on with banking.'
In her quest for greater independence for the bank, Mrs Pylarinou persuaded
the government to come up with a capital injection of Dr50bn. This helped
offset problems caused by the government's decision to end a longstanding
practice of subsidising interest rates on ETVA bonds.
ETVA has also paid off its overdraft with the central bank by starting to
take deposits from some of the big state-owned corporations, and recently
raised another Dr40bn through a one-year bond offered at an attractive
interest rate.
'We operate much more like a normal bank now, taking deposits and making
short-term loans. But it will still take another two or three years to clean
up the balance sheet,' Mrs Pylarinou says.
Inthe meantime, ETVA is trying to build new business elsewhere in the
Balkans, both through its participation in European Community programmes for
developing market economies in former east bloc countries and on a bilateral
basis.
ETVA is co-operating with the Romanian Development Bank on developing a
pilot industrial estate at Brailla on the Danube, to which it hopes to
attract Greek businessmen. The bank has set up more than 20 industrial
estates around Greece and retains a technical staff for such projects.
ETVA recently held a three-week training seminar and business forum on
privatisation and setting up joint ventures for technocrats from Romania,
Bulgaria and Albania. Plans are being discussed for ETVA to assist with
setting up a capital market in Romania, initially through a joint venture
for leasing activities and later by introducing financial services, leading
to the establishment of a stock exchange.
'The relationship with Romania is most advanced but we have projects in
other places, including the Ukraine. We want to have good connections in all
the eastern European countries,' Mrs Pylarinou says.

FT  15 JUN 92 / Survey of Greece (7): Big income growth forecast - Tourism
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KERIN HOPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN it comes to tourism, Greece would seem to have two identities. At least
half the 9.5m tourists expected this year will descend by charter flights on
just four islands - Crete, Rhodes, Corfu and Mykonos. That leaves another
150 or so islands and much of mainland Greece, still relatively unexplored,
for everyone else.
The pressure to accommodate as many tourists as possible, encouraged until
recently by generous government grants, has led to ribbon development of
hotels and apartment complexes along the coasts of Crete and Rhodes, the
most popular islands. Villages along the way have been transformed into
tourist service centres complete with pubs, pizzerias and Chinese
restaurants and ranks of jeeps and motorbikes for rent.
In theory, dozens of smaller islands have been opened up for mass tourism
through construction of airports that can handle charter jets. But there are
relatively few with a reliable water supply and enough sandy beaches for
large numbers of tourists. Instead, special interest holidays are
proliferating on small islands, partly as a result of European Community
nationals being able to set up businesses more easily in Greece under single
market rules.
Although it is still still on a small scale, the advantages of alternative
tourism, from mountain-biking to observing marine turtles, lies in its
resilience to external factors and its capacity for bringing income to more
remote areas. In Macedonia and the northern Aegean islands, for example, the
hotel occupancy rate is normally about 45 per cent, compared to 85 per cent
for Crete. But unlike the biggest tourist destinations, there was no decline
last year.
Greece, like other eastern Mediterranean countries, suffered as a result of
the Gulf war. Fears of terrorism proved unfounded but tour operators
cancelled bookings early in the season, charter flights started several
weeks later than usual and there was little demand for Aegean cruises.
Once recovery began in July, things rapidly improved, with demand for
package holidays on Rhodes and Crete remaining high throughout October.
Although tourist arrivals fell by 11 per cent in 1991 to 8.2m, the decline
was not reflected in earnings.
Official foreign exchange receipts from tourism dropped by 0.8 per cent to
Dollars 2.57bn, but overall income from tourism, which includes visitors'
credit card purchases and funds retained abroad by Greek travel agents, rose
by 12 per cent to Dollars 4.6bn, according to the Greek Tourist Organisation
(EOT).
While room rates have risen by only a small margin, the result of Greek
hoteliers' worries about staying competitive with Turkey and Cyprus, EOT
predicts a large increase in earnings this year.
Mr Costas Pylarinos, secretary-general of EOT, says that tourist arrivals
are expected to rise by 14 per cent this year, generating a 30 per cent
improvement in income.
One reason for his optimism, is that American visitors, who spend much more
lavishly than Europeans, are returning to Greece. Bookings for cruises,
where the majority of passengers are American, are at their highest levels
since the early 1980s. Moreover, the shake-up in the US airline industry has
brought an increase in flights to Greece by American carriers expanding
their networks in Europe.
But the figures also hint that Greece may at last be starting to attract
more of the up-market visitors on whom the tourist industry stakes its hopes
for the future. One problem has been a lack of luxury and first-class hotels
compared to the thousands of third-class establishments used by tour
operators at the cheaper end of the market.
Most of Greece's hotel stock dates from the 1970s but until recently little
attention was paid to refurbishing regularly, providing additional
facilities or improving service. As a result, tour operators from France,
Germany and Scandinavia are starting to buy Greek properties and carry out
full-scale renovations.
However, several Greek hoteliers who have developed professional management
operations as a result of working closely with European operators, together
with a few offshore Greek operators, have built luxury resort hotels over
the past three years and more are being planned.
Mr Pylarinos says he is looking for investors who will build conference
centres, golf courses and even casinos. All of these would help extend the
tourist season by at least three months from its present seven months, as
well as attracting more affluent tourists.
'We have no shortage of organisations wanting to hold congresses in Greece
at the start or the end of the season. But we're restricted to small affairs
of a thousand or so people at a hotel because we don't have a purpose-built
centre,' he says.
Golf courses are proving hard to develop, mainly because large tracts of
suitable land are hard to find, while farmers raise objections to losing
scarce pasturage. In the meantime, two of the four existing golf courses are
to be improved.
EOT also plans to expand its Dr12bn programme for building marinas. After
long delays caused by protests from local environmental organisations and a
squeeze on public investment funds, six marinas have been completed and
another eight are due to open by 1993. Altogether, they will have space for
20,000 yachts.
The marina programme was EOT's first move to make Greece more attractive to
better-off tourists. In fact, the existing marinas serve the rising number
of Greeks who are able to afford yachts and power boats, rather than
foreigners who find that berths are cheaper across the Aegean in Turkey. The
next stage of EOT's marina programme will be designed to lure them back.

FT  15 JUN 92 / Survey of Greece (8): Summer buying spree forecast by
brokers - Shipping
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN WHITTAKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR Greek shipowners, 1992 has so far resembled the proverbial curate's egg:
it has been good in parts.
Although freight markets plummeted, to the extent that by late spring the
word crisis was starting to replace recession, Greek owners are 'incredibly
liquid,' according to Piraeus bankers. They are thought to be waiting for
the moment when they believe the market has bottomed out before starting to
buy up ships at bargain prices.
Lines of credit are already being made available, including substantial
syndicated loan facilities, and vessels are being inspected. Brokers say
movement is still slow, but that by late summer the rush will be on to
acquire good second-hand tonnage. 'When a couple of the big names make a
move, the others will follow,' says a Piraeus banker.
At the same time, the weak market, together with increased operating costs
and insurance premiums, which have shot up this year from 25 to 100 per
cent, has an impact on every owner.
Mr John Goumas, president of the Union of Greek Shipowners (UGS) said: 'To a
certain extent we understand underwriters' demands for increased premiums,
which originate from the problems facing the insurance market. . . they must
show an understanding for the problems confronting shipping in a weak
market.
Whether based in Piraeus or abroad, a Greek shipowner picks his moment to
buy or sell, either for trading or as an asset play, but this is not to say
that international issues and government policies do not have a role to
play. For the UGS, the most pressing issue is the plethora of new rules and
regulations on safety and pollution prevention.
The broader financial implications of the stringent US Oil Pollution Act
1990 have already prompted a number of Greek operators to stop trading
altogether with the US, or in some cases to accept specific charters on a
limited basis. At a recent meeting in London of Greek and Norwegian owners,
concern was voiced over the proliferation of surveys, particularly condition
surveys recently introduced by the Salvage Association.
International owners do not question the argument that much more effort is
needed to improve safety at sea and protect the marine environment. However,
as the UGS puts it: 'What is required is not new rules and regulations but
effective implementation and enforcement of existing ones.'
At home, only limited progress has been made in furthering the ambitions of
Piraeus-based owners and the Greek government to make Piraeus a leading
international shipping and finance centre. The feeling is that incentives
launched by Mr Aristotle Pavlides, the merchant marine minister, to bring
Greek-owned vessels back to the home flag and for more offices to set up in
Piraeus, may be straying off course.
New shipping legislation introduced by the conservative government during
its two years in power is criticised for being a piecemeal set of measures.
Initially, tonnage taxes on vessels of 80,000 gross tons and over were
slashed by as much as 75 per cent, while those in the 40,000-80,000 ton
range enjoyed a 50 per cent tax cut. Later, manning requirements were
reduced on both conventional and automated vessels. Both moves were intended
to attract Greek-owned tonnage back to the national registry, with the
underlying aim of also bringing more ship managers to Piraeus.
Nonetheless, the Greek registry has shown encouraging growth. The latest
figures show that in October 1991 the Greek-flag fleet numbered 2,058
vessels totalling 23.7m Gross Registered Tons, against 2,008 vessels
totalling 21.5m GRT the previous year. Foreign exchange earnings from
shipping have remained high in the past two years, reaching Dollars 1.8bn in
1991, a 0.6 per cent increase over the previous year.
Piraeus port took precedence over the rest of the country under a plan by
the Hellenic Telecommunications Organisation (OTE), the state telecoms
monopoly, to upgrade switching systems and provide additional facilities.
Digital exchanges were set up, providing a direct satellite link abroad and
a telecommunications park was established. In addition to making several
thousand new lines available to Piraeus-based businesses, the programme also
aimed at improving telex and fax communications and offered electronic
mailbox services, videotext and leased channels.
But OTE's back-up system is still suffering growing pains. One shipping
company waited for more than a month to transfer a few telephone lines 150
yards to its new offices in the same street. When the new digital switching
system was suddenly knocked out, 48 hours passed before it was repaired,
much to the annoyance of local ship management offices.
Still, Greek shipowners are showing considerable interest in related
shore-based investments, such as the loss-making state-controlled shipyards
which are now up for sale. Under an EC ruling on ending subsidies to
shipyards, they must be sold or closed during 1992. A London-based shipping
group, Peraticos, bought a 73 per cent stake in Eleusis Shipyards from the
state-owned Commercial Bank for Dollars 60m.

FT  15 JUN 92 / Survey of Greece (6): Newcomers are making their presence
felt - Banking
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KERIN HOPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHATEVER may be happening elsewhere in the economy, Greek banking is
thriving. Six new private banks have opened in the past two years, one
state-controlled bank was privatised and three new foreign players joined
the market. This adds up to a 30 per cent increase in Greek banking
institutions.
While it is true that the new banks are small operations, often with no more
than the minimum capitalisation of Dr4bn (Dollars 21m) and only two or three
branches, they are making their presence felt.
It is not only foreign banks and larger private banks that are cutting costs
and thinking hard about new products for a more competitive environment. The
big state-controlled banks, which between them control some 75 per cent of
assets and 80 per cent of loans, are at last starting to modernise.
Life is easier for borrowers as a result, despite interest rates kept high
by inflation. A year ago, rates for working capital hovered around 29 per
cent, rising to more than 33 per cent when taxes and commissions were added.
Now the basic rate is about 23 per cent, although this may depend on a
corporate customer's bargaining power.
'It's a much healthier situation,' says one banker. 'But the mentality of
corporate customers is changing, from relationship banking to shopping
around for a particular deal.'
One advantage enjoyed by the new banks is having to place only 20 per cent
of their reserves in government paper, according to central bank
requirements. The reserve ruling is being phased out altogether over the
next year, but that is not much consolation for older banks which have 40
per cent of their reserves - the regulation amount until last year - tied up
in Treasury bills.
In 1991, the government arranged for Dr1,600bn of these reserves to be
converted into medium-term bonds with a three- to seven-year maturity. The
idea was that they should form the basis of a secondary market in government
securities.
But given the present squeeze in Greek financial markets, with the
government financing the public sector wage and pension bills with monthly
issues of T-bills at attractive rates, this plan proved too optimistic.
Instead, the banks have turned to repos - fixed term selling and repurchase
orders of government debt - in a big way.
Government securities are still tax-free, which accounts for a flight of
savings from the banks last year with the introduction of a 10 per cent tax
on interest earnings on deposit accounts. Bank deposits grew overall by only
5.4 per cent in 1991 to Dr8,856bn. In the first two months of this year,
they showed a decline of Dr105bn.
The crowding-out effect, together with shrinking margins on traditional
lending business, are making all Greek banks look more closely at fee-based
activities. Spreads have fallen sharply as lending rates came down but the
basic savings rate, set by the central bank, remained at 18 per cent.
The new banks are setting up mutual funds and developing private banking as
they try to find the right operating niche. Their specialities range from
shipping lending to mortgage loans and consumer credit. Established banks,
too, have launched mutual funds and moved into leasing and underwriting.
In a country with only 2,400 bank branches to serve a population of 1m,
there is plenty of room for banks to grow. Yet however successful they
become, the private banks will find it increasingly hard to make headway if
the big state banks focus on competing effectively.
'If the state banks can throw off their chains, they have the muscle to push
the rest of us aside,' says a foreign banker.
The impetus for reform at state-controlled banks is coming from new
management appointed by the government last year, consisting of younger
Greek bankers who were working abroad or for foreign banks in Athens. Under
their guidance, the state banks have substantially increased their capital
base over the past 18 months and raised provisions for doubtful loans.
Following the example of some foreign banks, they have strengthened their
dealing rooms to international standards.
As long-overdue investment in new computers is made, automated telling
machines are appearing around Athens branches and the leading tourist
resorts. But no state bank has yet dared to suggest that cheque books and
credit cards should replace the pass-book system, still the basis of
personal banking in Greece.
But the effects of change are beginning to show. Commercial Bank, the second
biggest state bank, reported an 85 per cent increase in profits to Dr35bn.
Its subsidiary, Ionian Bank, also did well with a 42 per cent rise to
Dr15.65bn.
Mr Takis Arapoglou, chairman of Ionian, says: 'We stopped the state bank
accounting practice of accruing unpaid interest on non-performing loans. But
we still have some way to go in clearing up our portfolio.'
If the state banks are to have a chance of becoming efficient, two things
must happen. First, regulations that make it virtually impossible for staff
to be dismissed have to be revised, enabling operating costs to be cut. Like
other public institutions, state banks are a target for making patronage
appointments.
Then the curious legal status of the state banks must be changed so that
they can no longer be used as instruments of government policy. At present,
the finance minister has a proxy vote on behalf of their main shareholders -
the state-controlled insurance companies and welfare funds, the
universities, even the Orthodox Church.
So far the government has proved reluctant to give up this privilege and set
the state banks free.

FT  15 JUN 92 / Survey of Greece (5): Quickening pace of sales -
Privatisation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KERIN HOPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE quickening pace of sales this year under Greece's privatisation
programme has come as a relief to the government, but as one official puts
it: 'Once you clear away the undergrowth of small disposals, the real
dimensions of our task looms much larger.'
Privatisation was launched two years ago with the initial aim of selling 27
debt-burdened companies nationalised under Socialist rule. But as the
state-controlled banks - with assets that include shipyards, mines and
quarries, hotels and insurance companies, joined in - the list of companies
to be privatised grew to more than 200.
The government also wants to sell minority stakes of up to 49 per cent in
state-owned utilities and transport companies. Most post losses every year,
the result of weak management and rising costs: administered prices were
kept low while payrolls swelled with political appointees.
But the most ambitious aspect of Greek privatisation is only now taking
shape. Mr Andreas Andrianopoulos, the industry minister and a firm believer
in unbundling the state, intends to dispose of about 300 public entities
attached to different ministries in the next two years.
These range from companies set up to manage industrial projects that never
materialised to moribund trading organisations and farm co-operatives. They
have managed to survive because, like the utilities, they were a convenient
receptacle for patronage appointments.
Mr Andrianopoulos has steered a new privatisation law through parliament
which removes many hurdles to swift liquidation of non-viable companies. The
law also provides a clear legal framework for sales and debt write-offs,
which banks and other creditors were reluctant to attempt for fear of future
lawsuits.
'It's really more a process of denationalisation than privatisation, because
the state is an obstacle to growth,' he said recently.
Opposition to Mr Andrianopoulos's scheme comes as much from cabinet
colleagues as from boards of directors afraid of losing their jobs or
customers anxious to maintain a cosy relationship with a state-controlled
producer. Some ministers at first declined to provide lists of companies
under their jurisdiction; others sent in a few names scrawled on a sheet of
paper.
For all the government's avowed commitment to privatising, it is clear that
the old etatist mentality still persists. For example, Depa, a utility set
up to supervise construction of a pipeline and liquified natural gas
terminal for importing Russian and Algerian natural gas to Greece, is to
remain state-owned.
In theory, the next stage of the Dr250bn (Dollars 1.2bn) project, creating
networks for distributing the gas in leading Greek cities, should be open to
bids from private companies under the government's policy of making the
energy sector more competitive. In practice, the absence of a regulatory
framework for power generation rules out broader participation, for the time
being.
Elsewhere, privatisation is gaining momentum after a slow start. The 1991
budget forecast revenues of more than Dr150bn from sales of nationalised
companies, but only Dr10bn was raised. 'Transparency was important, and it
took time to get international procedures working in the bureaucratic Greek
environment,' says one adviser.
However, 22 of the 27 companies offered by the Industrial Reconstruction
Organisation (IRO), the socialists' nationalisation umbrella, have now been
sold. Buyers have mostly been local competitors rather than foreign
investors.
The exception was Heracles General Cement, Europe's biggest cement exporter,
sold for Dr124bn to a joint venture between Calcestruzzi, the construction
arm of Italy's Ferruzzi group, and National Bank of Greece. The
participation of National Bank, the country's largest state-owned bank, was
seen as essential in order to overcome legal problems caused by the
capitalisation of Dr27bn in debt owed by Heracles. The capitalisation was in
violation of European Community company law because shareholders were not
consulted.
If the capitalisation is eventually declared invalid, National Bank will
revert to being the largest shareholder in Heracles. Calcestruzzi, with a
52.5 per cent stake in the joint venture, will be responsible for running
the company.
The state-owned banks between them have sold another 30 companies, again to
local rather than foreign buyers. The biggest disposal was that of Eleusis
Shipyards, sold by Commercial Bank for Dollars 60m to the Peraticos group, a
London-based Greek shipping business.
Another three loss-making shipyards, also controlled by state banks, must be
sold or shut down over the next few months in order to meet an EC deadline
for ending subsidies to the shipbuilding industry. The yards were taken over
by the state after an older generation of Greek shipowners pulled out of
onshore investment in Greece during the shipping crisis of the early 1980s.
Despite a steady flow of repair work and some construction of small vessels
for the Greek navy, the yards were kept going through cash infusions from
the state banks, with little attention paid to improving productivity. The
EC has agreed to the writing off of large amounts of debt; even so, the
government is finding it difficult to attract offers. The most attractive
target for buyers is the Hellenic Telecommunications Organisation (OTE), the
state telecoms monopoly, which is to be partially privatised. A 49 per cent
stake will be offered in two stages. With earnings in 1991 of Dr55bn, OTE is
one of Greece's most profitable companies, despite operating little more
than an old-fashioned telephone network with only a few digital exchanges
and a chronic shortage of lines.
A new regulatory framework, drawn up with assistance from the EC and
international legal experts, will be in place later this year. The
government intends to offer a 20-30 per cent stake in OTE to an
international operator, who would also take over management, with the
remaining percentage being sold through a public offering in Greece and
abroad.

FT  15 JUN 92 / Survey of Greece (2): Home to roost, with a vengeance - The
Economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT MAUTHNER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AFTER years of fiscal profligacy, mismanagement of the large
state-controlled economic sectors and market distortions caused by
over-regulation and protection, Greece has finally had to face up to the
dire economic problems which it has so long feigned to ignore.
It is ironic that it is the very European Community which Greece joined in
1981 - and which it has always regarded as a generous provider of funds
rather than as a law-maker whose rules must be obeyed - that should now be
one of the main instruments forcing Greece to put its economic house in
order. The goose that laid the golden eggs has come home to roost with a
vengeance.
The results of the austerity measures introduced by the conservative New
Democracy government led by Mr Constantine Mitsotakis, since it came to
power in April 1990, have been described as 'inadequate' and 'seriously out
of line with targets' by the European Commission in a remarkably damning
report issued last March.
It is widely recognised that the prime minister faced an extremely difficult
task. After nearly a decade of socialist government under Mr Andreas
Papandreou, he inherited a disastrous economic situation marked by a soaring
public deficit, a public debt-GDP ratio much higher than that of any of the
Latin American states at the height of their worst crises and a rate of
inflation at least 2.5 times the average in the EC.
A paper-thin majority of only two parliamentary seats has not made the prime
minister's task any easier. However, Mr Mitsotakis's critics - some of whom
can be found inside his own party - complain that too much valuable time was
lost by the New Democracy government before it started implementing a
three-year stabilisation programme at the beginning of last year. The
publicity-shy Mr Stefanos Manos, the new economics minister, is reputed to
share this view and wants to press ahead with more radical stabilisation
measures.
However, Mr Mitsotakis is fast running out of time. The next general
election is due in 1994 and political expediency dictates that no really
unpopular measures are taken by the government in the last year of its term.
That means, failing a political death-wish entirely uncharacteristic of
Greek politicians, that the administration of any really effective economic
medicine can be virtually ruled out from 1993 onwards.
Even the European Commission, frustrated as it undoubtedly is after years of
preaching in the wilderness, recognises that some useful steps have been
taken by the government to prepare the Greek economy for the EC's Single
Market. Significant progress has been made, particularly in liberalising
international capital movements and the domestic financial system.
Long-term capital movements have been liberalised and controls have been
lifted on current international transactions. Credit controls have been
abolished, staged cuts in the special reserve requirements of banks are
being made, and the state's right to borrow directly from the central bank
through the obligatory purchase by banks of Treasury Bills is being phased
out.
Price controls on a broad range of goods and services have been lifted, wage
indexation has been abolished and replaced by a strict incomes policy for
the public sector, a freeze in the hiring of public sector employees has
been in effect since last year and the oil market is in the process of being
deregulated.
The privatisation programme is also, at last, being implemented at a more
reasonable pace. In 1991, some 14 of the so-called 'problematic enterprises'
had been sold and 11 liquidated, followed in March this year by the sale of
70 per cent of the Heracles cement company
A long-awaited tax reform package - aimed at boosting inadequate national
revenues, at least in the longer run, broadening the tax base and curbing
Greeks' favourite pastime of tax evasion by the imposition of stricter
penalties and the confiscation of professional licences - was finally tabled
in parliament in May, although its eventual shape remains problematical.
On the external front, too, the news has been much better. The current
account deficit fell by as much as 60 per cent last year to Dollars 1.46bn,
scarcely more than 2 per cent of GDP. This was thanks mainly to large net
inflows of invisibles, particularly from the EC, which account for as much
as 25 per cent of Greece's invisible earnings. A marked decline in imports,
as the result of the domestic recession, also contributed substantially to
the much-improved balance of payments performance.
All these positive developments, however, cannot compensate for the
economy's fundamental failings. Until the large public deficit is brought
under control and the huge debt overhang begins to be reduced, a sustainable
economic recovery is not achievable.
The net public sector borrowing requirement (PSBR) of 14.1 per cent of GDP
in 1991, although lower than the previous year and a great improvement on
the 20 per cent figure when the government took office, was still 3.7
percentage points higher than the objective set by the government. The
target is to reduce the deficit to 9.1 per cent of GDP in 1992, but given
what are considered by independent experts as the over-optimistic budget
forecasts for tax and privatisation revenues, the out-turn is likely to be
at least 2 points higher.
The high fiscal deficit has undoubtedly contributed to the persistence of
inflation at an unacceptably high level by EC standards of about 18 per cent
since the summer of last year. Prospects that the annual rate for 1992 as a
whole will fall any lower than about 16 per cent, in spite of the
maintenance of tight monetary conditions, restrictive incomes policies and
weak demand, are considered to be dim.
However, as the EC Commission report said: 'the magnitude of the problem is
not to be seen simply in the scale of the deficits, but in the underlying
financial fragility.'
Public sector debt is now equivalent to as much as 135 to 140 per cent of
GDP. Significant debt-servicing problems arose in 1991, leading the
government to reschedule its own debt in addition to already existing
capitalisation of debt interest. The resulting postponement of debt
servicing has stored financial problems for Greek governments in future
years.
The remedies are clear. If Greece is to fulfil the tough terms for the
second tranche of the Ecu2.2bn (Pounds 1.54bn) loan granted to it
conditionally by the EC last year, the government will have to make another
huge adjustment effort. That will require substantial public spending cuts
and further structural reforms, involving sharp reductions in both the wage
bill and staffing levels of state-owned enterprises and the early
implementation of proposals for reforming the social security system.
The problem is not so much what to do as how to make it palatable to a
political class and society chronically affected by the disease of
'short-termism.' The government's almost impossible task is to persuade the
Greek people that any further delay in the implementation of radical
solutions will inevitably lead to the permanent marginalisation of Greece in
the European Community.

FT  15 JUN 92 / Survey of Greece (3): Government is looking somewhat shaky -
Politics
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KERIN HOPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE longevity of Greek political leaders is such that young parliamentarians
who aspire to high office must have more than the usual quota of patience.
Retirement is something that the old party chieftains do not like to
contemplate.
Considering that the same three personalities have played leading roles in
public life for the past 30 years, it is not surprising that the Greeks are
less passionate about politics these days.
When Mr Constantine Karamanlis, the elderly head of state, was rushed to
London for a check-up recently, there was no debate over whether he should
consider stepping down for health reasons. In fact, his presence is seen as
a prop to political stability, although the job is merely ceremonial.
Halfway through its four-year term, the conservative government of Mr
Constantine Mitsotakis is looking somewhat shaky. His New Democracy (ND)
party has only a one-seat majority in parliament now that Mr Mikis
Theodorakis, the composer, has given up his cabinet post and decided to sit
as an independent.
It is important for Mr Mitsotakis that Mr Karamanlis should remain in
office. As the founder of ND, he is thought to have a moderating influence
on the conservative barons who might feel tempted to unseat the 73-year-old
prime minister.
At this point there are more prominent ND personalities outside the cabinet
than in it - the result both of leading conservatives wanting to distance
themselves from unpopular government policies and of Mr Mitsotakis's growing
impatience with ministers who step out of line.
Furthermore, if Mr Karamanlis were to depart, it would be almost impossible
for the conservatives and socialists to agree on a new presidential
candidate. Failure by parliament to elect a new president by a two-thirds
majority on its third attempt would mean an immediate election.
Despite their ideological differences, some socialists find the patriarchal
Mr Karamanlis a reassuring figure. For all the protestations of Mr Andreas
Papandreou, also 73, that he is in good enough shape to serve as prime
minister again, several senior members of Pasok say they are happy to sit
out a full term in opposition.
This is a polite way of saying that Mr Papandreou, whose health has been in
doubt since he underwent open-heart surgery four years ago, is no longer
Pasok's undisputed leader. There are now even more candidates to succeed him
than there are conservatives stalking Mr Mitsotakis.
Yet Mr Papandreou's position was strengthened as a result of his acquittal
by a special court of corruption charges connected with the 1988 Bank of
Crete embezzlement scandal. Now that parliament has decided against pressing
charges in another case, in which the former prime minister was accused of
ordering illegal phone-taps of political colleagues and opponents, the
socialists are well placed to take the offensive.
The conservatives will be especially vulnerable in the next few months as
they launch further spending cuts and debate extra revenue-raising measures
while putting together the Greek plan for economic convergence with the rest
of the EC. Mr Mitsotakis may even consider going to the country in search of
a new mandate to pursue the radical reforms that will be needed.
However, the socialists have not yet come up with an alternative economic
policy. There is no shortage of competent economists in Pasok, but
suspicions between rival factions run so deep that a coherent programme is
unlikely to emerge.
Instead, the party organisers have reverted to their old tactic of
sloganeering.
One deterrent to conservative thoughts of holding an early election is an
irrevocable split in the left, pointing to increased support for Pasok in
the future as dissatisfied leftwingers change sides.
The communist-led Left Alliance, which participated in a brief coalition
government with the conservatives in 1989, has broken up after a bitter
ideological dispute in the Greek communist party (KKE). The Stalinist
faction remained in control of the KKE - and of its extensive financial
resources - while the reformists joined the moderate non-communist wing of
the Alliance.
Ironically, the split produced two much younger party leaders, both women.
But with the opinion polls showing a sharp decline in support for both
leftwing parties, neither Mrs Maria Damanaki of the Alliance or Mrs Aleca
Papariga of the KKE seems likely to build a fresh image for her party.
The division in the left has also upset the conservatives' electoral
arithmetic. A new electoral law was passed in 1990 which favours both the
front-runner and the third-placed party under Greece's complicated
proportional voting system.
But with the new political realities, either of the left-wing parties could
have trouble winning the 3 per cent of the vote needed to secure
representation in parliament.

EVERY nation's foreign policy is rooted in its history. But in the case of
Greece this influence is so profound that it often seems as if the country's
international posture and popular attitudes are caught in a time-warp and
have little relevance to the evolution of other nations' internal political
situations and foreign policies.
In many respects, the ending of the Cold war and the break-up of the Soviet
empire have merely exacerbated historical Greek fears and suspicions of the
territorial ambitions of its Balkan neighbours, old and new, previously
constrained from embarking on international adventures by strict communist
regimes or membership of the defunct Yugoslav federation.
At the same time, Greece's traditional adversary, Turkey, is seen in Athens
as having won greater room for manoeuvre on the international stage by the
momentous events in the former Soviet Union and the collapse of the
communist system.
Now that it no longer has its hands tied to anything like the same extent by
its previous role of guard of Nato's south-eastern flank, Turkey is able to
devote more of its energies to enhancing its regional influence.
In addition to long-existing areas of bilateral conflict - such as the
Aegean continental shelf and airspace, Cyprus, Turkey's relationship with
the European Community and the rights of the Turkish-speaking minority of
Western Thrace - Athens perceives new threats to the regional balance of
power in Ankara's efforts to forge close links with the former Soviet
central Asian republics, its rapprochement with Bulgaria and its support for
the Moslems of Bosnia.
With one foot in western Europe and the other in the Balkans, Athens often
does not know which one to dance on. It is hardly surprising, therefore,
that Greek foreign policy trips over itself so frequently. No better example
can be found than the current furore over the EC's intention to recognise as
an independent state the former Yugoslav republic of Macedonia.
Greece is not opposed in principle to recognition, but it objects to the
name Macedonia being employed to describe the new state and wants it to be
called the Republic of Skopje, the name of its capital, to avoid any
possible political or cultural confusion with the real Macedonia in northern
Greece.
The root of the problem goes much deeper than the appropriation of a name
describing a territory which Greeks have always considered to be part of
their cultural identity since Alexander the Great. It reflects deep-seated
fears of irredentism in a region whose multi-ethnic composition is a recipe
for instability and conflict.
Since the Balkan wars of 1912-13, after which Greece received 51 per cent of
the former Ottoman region of Macedonia, including the port of Salonika,
compared with Serbia's 39 per cent and Bulgaria's 10 per cent, Greece has
constantly feared that nationalists in the Yugoslav state of Macedonia would
some day make territorial claims against Greece. Attempts by communist
guerrillas supported by Marshal Tito to lop off northern Greek territory
during the Greek civil war of the 1940s seemed to offer some support for
these fears.
More recently, officials in Skopje have spoken of the rights of a
230,000-strong Slavonic-speaking minority in northern Greece, while
irredentist leaders have sketched out plans for a greater Macedonia which
would embrace both the Greek slavophones and those of Bulgaria. Athens has
strongly denied the existence of such a large homogeneous slavophone group
within its borders and has insisted that northern Greek Macedonia is no more
than a geographical region inhabited by Greeks.
So far, no compromise is in the offing, but it seems highly unlikely that
Greece's EC partners will be willing to tolerate Athens's veto of the
recognition of the republic of Macedonia, under the name that its people
have chosen, for much longer.
It is not that other governments do not understand the historical background
to Greece's attitude. Rather do they consider it as based on 19th or early
20th century premises no longer relevant to the new European order.
Greece is no longer acting alone or with one or two allies against other
powerful alliances, but is a member of the EC, Conference on Security and
Co-operation in Europe (CSCE), Nato and other international organisations
which would not permit attempts to change its borders or the incorporation
by others of large areas of its territory. Indeed, the EC is insisting that
new republics seeking recognition should provide constitutional and
political guarantees that they do not harbour any territorial claims on a
neighbouring territory.
The irritation with Greece over the Macedonian affair, now being openly
expressed by its European partners, is matched by their mounting annoyance
at Athens's refusal to adopt a more constructive policy towards Turkey - in
spite of clear signs that the new Turkish government led by Mr Suleyman
Demirel is prepared to be more conciliatory in its dealings with Greece.
The other members of the Community, conscious of Turkey's important role as
a bridge-builder with the former Moslem republics of Central Asia and
appreciative of the recent progress made by Turkey in the field of
democratic government and human rights, are anxious to bind Turkey more
closely to the western camp.
Greece's partners find it surprising that Athens does not appear to
understand that such a rapprochement is ultimately in Greece's own interests
and that it requires concrete goodwill gestures from both sides of the
Aegean.
The meeting earlier this year between Mr Constantine Mitzotakis, the Greek
prime minister, and Mr Demirel, was a step in the right direction. But it
was supposed to have led to the signing of a Greek-Turkish Friendship
Treaty, of which little has been heard since.
Certainly, Greece has been unfairly blamed for being solely responsible for
Turkey's continued exclusion from the EC. The European Commission, in a
recent report, has made it abundantly clear that substantial economic
obstacles to Turkish membership continue to exist and that there is no
realistic prospect of Turkey joining the Community before the beginning of
the next century.
But, in the meantime, there seems to be no good reason for Greece to
continue blocking EC loans to Turkey under its association agreement with
the Community or Turkey's participation in new arrangements for the
Mediterranean countries.
Ostensibly, Greece's hardline policy is intended to make the Turks adopt a
more conciliatory attitude towards the Cyprus problem, an issue which, more
than any other, has bedevilled Greek-Turkish relations since the occupation
of the north of Cyprus by Turkish troops in 1974.
That has proved to be a misguided tactic, since the Turks long ago made it
clear that they are not prepared to trade benefits in other areas for
concessions on Cyprus which are not in line with what they consider to be an
equitable settlement.
A slim hope exists that a Cyprus settlement can be reached this summer on
the basis of new ideas put forward by Mr Boutros Boutros-Ghali, the United
Nations secretary-general. But that will require a much greater spirit of
compromise and more profound understanding of the wider regional and
international issues at stake than either the Greek and Turkish Cypriot
leaders, or Athens and Ankara, have shown so far.
But it is above all in its policy towards the European Community that Greece
would be well advised to adopt a more accommodating stance, for it is in the
process of losing influential friends who provide it with much of the funds
needed to modernise its economy.
More attention to Greece's real interests in western Europe and less direct
involvement in the Balkan cauldron could do much to transform Greece's
current jaundiced view of the world and prevent its threatened
marginalisation.

FT  15 JUN 92 / Survey of Greece (1): Urgent need for reforms - Greece's
economic troubles show few signs of abating. A stabilisation programme
launched last year with the aim of closing the gap with the rest of the EC
has fallen far behind schedule. Structural reforms that would curtail
spending have been postponed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
FOR all its years of European Community membership, Greece sometimes bears
more resemblance to its Balkan neighbours than to its European partners.
The current outburst of nationalist feeling against recognising Macedonia,
the former Yugoslav republic adjoining northern Greece, is a case in point.
Senior officials will discuss arcane aspects of regional history with an
eloquence that is lacking when the question of preparations for European
monetary union comes up.
Yet Greece's economic troubles show few signs of abating. The stabilisation
programme launched last year with the aim of closing the gap with the rest
of the EC, has fallen well behind schedule.
This was not entirely unexpected, given that extremely stiff terms were
agreed with the European Commission in return for an Ecu2.2bn (Pounds
1.54bn) special loan in three instalments.
But in addition to missing the targets set for curbing inflation and the
ballooning public sector deficit, the government postponed launching
structural reforms that would effectively curtail spending.
The result is a prolonged period of embarrassment for Mr Constantine
Mitsotakis, the prime minister, and Mr Stefanos Manos, his new economy
minister.
They cannot ask for payment of the second tranche of the loan until some
lost ground has been made up and the Commission approves the Greek plan for
achieving economic convergence with its EC partners by 1997.
Mr Manos, a former businessman who trained at Harvard, is well aware that
despite the uncertainty generated by the Danish decision to reject the
Maastricht treaty, structural reform remains urgent.
The Greek predicament was recently underlined by Portugal's entry to the
exchange rate mechanism (ERM) of the European Monetary System, which leaves
the drachma as the only currency outside the system. Even the most
optimistic of Greek bankers believe that it will be at least another year
before the inflation rate drops enough for Greek entry to be possible.
However, Mr Mitsotakis is an old-fashioned politician who finds it difficult
to resist pressure from special interest groups. In public he stresses the
danger that because of its weak economy, Greece will not be able to function
as an equal partner in the Community.
Yet he appears to condone delay as the price of eventually winning cabinet
acceptance for the measures proposed by Mr Manos and his advisers.
Mr Manos advocates another five years of austerity, with minimal wage
increases and deep spending cuts with the aim of halving the deficit by
1997.
Growth would be stimulated by increased EC assistance - including the new
'cohesion fund' for poorer members - for important projects to improve
transport and telecommunications.
But with a rebellious cabinet and only a one-seat majority in parliament, Mr
Mitsotakis feels obliged to tread cautiously. Several of his potential
successors as leader of the conservative New Democracy party are no longer
members of the government. At present, Mr Mitsotakis is also his own foreign
minister, having sacked the youthful foreign minister, Mr Antonis Samaras,
in a well-publicised dispute over his handling of the Macedonian problem.
Ask a constituency worker in New Democracy why economic reform is so
painfully slow and the answer comes at once: 'Political cost.' It is clear
to almost everyone that the measures demanded by the terms of the EC loan
will deal a fatal blow to the all-pervasive patronage system by which the
ruling party rewards its supporters with public sector jobs. Modernisation
of the civil service is proving one of the most contentious issues. The
government agreed to trim 50,000 jobs by 1993, amounting to 10 per cent of
the civil service payroll. But as the Commission pointed out in a recent
report on the Greek economy, instead of shrinking, the number of civil
servants grew by 4.4 per cent last year.
The government has decided to tackle the other potentially explosive problem
first: overhauling the welfare system in order to reduce pension outlays
which, together with wages, add up to about 40 per cent of budget spending.
Proposals from an experts' committee include gradually raising the
pensionable age to 60 by the end of the decade and extending years of
service. Women, for example, will no longer qualify for a pension in their
mid-30s after only 15 years in a job.
A fierce reaction to the changes is expected, led by the Panhellenic
Socialist Movement (Pasok), whose generous welfare policies in the 1980s,
combined with a disregard for revenue-raising, are held responsible for the
present impasse.
Mr Andreas Papandreou, the Pasok leader, is in more vigorous form after his
acquittal by a special court of corruption while in office.
His health appears to have improved, while the prospect of mounting a
campaign against the government's restrictive social policies cannot fail to
appeal to his populist instincts.
Support for the government has weakened with the imposition this year of a
wage freeze in the public sector. Several thousand jobs have been lost
through sales and closures of debt-ridden nationalised companies under the
government's wide-ranging privatisation programme.
Unemployment is rising, especially among the young and unskilled whose
chances of finding a job are reduced by the presence of more than 150,000
Albanian, Bulgarian and Polish immigrants working illegally in Greece.
However, the mood is brighter in the private sector.
Businessmen say they are well placed to take advantage of the reforms that
have been introduced. Almost all price controls have been lifted in the past
year. A new tax law making its way through parliament provides for deep cuts
in corporation tax and sharply reduced income tax for both high and low
earners.
Despite gloomy predictions, no massive flight of capital followed the
lifting of curbs on medium-term capital movement. In fact, business
confidence improved, with capital inflows remaining at fairly high levels.
There is now talk of liberalising remaining exchange controls by 1993,
rather than seeking a two-year postponement already sanctioned by the
Community. In the view of many bankers, this could help bring home a
substantial proportion of the estimated Dollars 10bn held by Greeks in
overseas bank accounts.
While the Foreign Ministry flaunts its disagreements with Balkan neighbours,
Greek businessmen are quietly developing contacts. Greece is officially
annoyed with Bulgaria for recognising Macedonian independence and for
drawing closer to its traditional enemy, Turkey.
But the flourishing Greek food-processing industry is starting to invest
there, and a growing list of joint ventures includes manufacturing units on
both sides of the border.
Even in Albania, where relations are dogged by mutual suspicion and official
recriminations over treatment of the North Epirots, the ethnic Greek
minority in the south of the country, tentative steps are being taken.
Greeks are involved in a number of farming projects and small textile
plants.
Still, Greece cannot make a lasting contribution to the development of
market economies in the Balkans unless the muddle over recognising Macedonia
is cleared up and its own economy is on the road to convergence.
If Mr Mitsotakis continues his delays, both this and the other opportunities
offered by closer European co-operation will simply disappear.

FT  15 JUN 92 / Slovaks delay talks with Czechs: Impatience over
federation's future prompts call for interim government
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
SLOVAK nationalists yesterday postponed negotiations on the future of the
Czechoslovak federation with already impatient Czech partners, further
delaying chances that a federal government may soon be formed to head the
country.
Mr Vladimir Meciar, the newly-elected Slovak leader, is due to meet Mr
Vaclav Klaus, his Czech counterpart, for a third round of negotiation over
the fate of the contested federation in Prague on Wednesday.
Previous negotiations ended in a complete deadlock last week, with Mr Klaus
rejecting the demands of Slovaks for a 'economic and defence union of
sovereign states' which he termed 'the end of the common state'.
Mr Klaus has instead called for the quick formation of an interim federal
government to decide on the fate of the federation. The Czech leader has
insisted that a federal government be created before July 5, when President
Vaclav Havel is due to be re-elected in the federal parliament - which Mr
Meciar has pledged to block.
The Slovak leader's decision to delay the third round of negotiations
confirmed the attempts by Slovaks to gain time before the first meeting of
the federal parliament. Mr Klaus' Civic Democratic party, which won 30 per
cent of the vote of the Czech republic, will have a hard time there, as it
faces opposition by left-wing Czech parties willing to team up with Slovak
nationalists.
'We want a decision to be made as soon as possible and to know which way we
are going, but the Slovaks want a long erosion of the federation,' a member
of Mr Klaus' party said yesterday.
Mounting exasperation towards Slovak demands is increasingly dominating the
Czech mood. While Slovaks have in principle agreed on an interim federal
government, they insist that a referendum on a formal break-up be held in
Slovakia late this year.
But Mr Klaus retorted after the second round of negotiations in Prague on
Thursday that 'the Czechs cannot afford to wait so long'.
Meanwhile, Czechs angered by the Slovak opposition to re-electing Mr Havel
have started a petition in Prague calling for 'a federation or nothing'.
In Bratislava yesterday, however, 2,000 Slovak demonstrators started their
own petition in favour of a federation.
Current polls indicate that the bulk of the Slovak population would not
favour independence today, but the nationalists, who together won 45 per
cent of the Slovak vote, hope this attitude will change by the end of the
year, especially if they can manage to blame the impatience of the Czechs
for breaking up the federation.

Two Russian servicemen were killed in an all-night battle with Georgian
national guardsmen who demanded that their ex-Soviet army base hand over
weapons and military equipment. A third soldier later died in hospital,
Reuter reports from Moscow.
Russia's Radio Mayak said yesterday three soldiers, one woman and a
six-year-old child were also injured in the attack on a tank regiment
headquarters in the town of Gori.
Itar-Tass news agency reported that the national guardsmen seized two
hostages, including the mayor of Gori, to press their claim. They opened
fire when the garrison commander refused to give in to their demands.
The commander retaliated by using helicopters to repulse the attack, Radio
Mayak reported, killing 12 and injuring 28 of the attackers.

FT  15 JUN 92 / (CORRECTED) Sir John Cuckney to seek Maxwell assets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Correction (published 20th June 1992) appended to this article.
SIR John Cuckney, a leading City figure with a reputation as a company
doctor, is to head a new government trust to solicit contributions on behalf
of the Maxwell company pensioners. The trust, announced last week by Mr
Peter Lilley, Social Security Secretary, will also aid in the return of
stolen pension fund assets.
In announcing the trust, Mr Lilley said many financial institutions which
had profited handsomely from legitimate transactions with Mr Robert Maxwell
over the years 'may well feel some moral obligation to assist the pensioners
who have so cruelly lost at Maxwell's hands'.
The government is said to be reminding City institutions of the possibility
of new regulations should voluntary appeals not be met. However, City
financial institutions and advisers to Mr Maxwell have reacted with
indignation to the suggestion that they have an obligation to aid
pensioners, saying they are not responsible for the theft.
Sir John will also be responsible for co-ordinating government efforts to
trace and secure Maxwell pension fund assets outside the UK and for
co-ordinating legal moves by trustees for the various pension fund schemes.
Sir John is non-executive chairman of Royal Insurance and will soon be
departing as chairman of 3i, the UK's largest source of venture finance.
Until December 1990 he was a director of Lazard Brothers, the investment
bank, which was at one time manager of a portion of the Maxwell company
pension funds.
Separately, it emerged yesterday that Robson Rhodes, liquidators to
Bishopsgate Investment Management, manager and trustee of the Maxwell
pensions funds, is to sue Mr Kevin Maxwell and Mr Ian Maxwell for the
recovery of Pounds 850m of assets.
A detailed civil writ for Pounds 450m was issued against Mr Kevin Maxwell on
December 8 last year. Another writ for Pounds 400m against Mr Ian Maxwell
was served several months ago.
Mr Kevin Maxwell has until July 6 to file a defence and a High Court hearing
will take place next month. The court has yet to set a date on the charges
relating to Mr Ian Maxwell.
The actions are civil cases and are entirely independent of any criminal
action which may be taken against the brothers.
Correction (published 20th June 1992) appended to this article.
THE FT of Monday June 15 incorrectly reported that Lazard Brothers managed a
portion of the Mirror Group Newspapers Pension Scheme. In fact, Lazard
Freres and Co was the manager.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
WESTPAC Banking Corporation, the Australian bank, yesterday said the
downgrading of its credit rating by a European ratings agency was
disappointing, but not unexpected following its net loss of ADollars 1.6bn
(USDollars 1.2bn) for 1991-1992.
International Banking Credit Analysis (IBCA) said earlier that it had
downgraded Westpac's long-term credit rating to A-plus from AA-minus, and
its short-term rating to A1 from A1 plus.
The agency said the action reflected a decline in the bank's asset quality.
Westpac wrote off ADollars 2.65bn against bad and doubtful debts, of which
more than ADollars 2.1bn reflected a revaluation of property values.
IBCA said Westpac had written down its property-related assets to values
that could readily be realised under current market conditions.
It also noted that the bank's risk-weighted capital ratio was above 8 per
cent, the level required by the Reserve Bank of Australia. The balance sheet
will be further boosted by a planned ADollars 1.2bn rights issue.
'We had been concerned that Westpac was under-reserved against doubtful
assets, and the decisive action taken by management to address this problem
is clearly a positive development,' IBCA said.

FT  13 JUN 92 / Scots court rules out car clamping on private land
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE, Legal Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MRS JANE COOK from Laxfield, Suffolk, who was forced to hand over a gold
tooth as 'security' to get her car released after it was clamped in Norwich
this week, may wish that she lived in Scotland.
The Justiciary Appeal Court in Edinburgh yesterday ruled that private wheel
clamping operations on private land north of the border were illegal. Lord
Hope, the Lord Justice General, said holding cars to ransom amounted to
'extortion and theft'.
Two employees of a private wheel clamping company based in Hamilton,
Lanarkshire, were appealing against a decision in Hamilton Sheriff Court
that they should face charges of extortion and attempted extortion.
The case was brought against them after they clamped a car parked without
permission in a private car park near shops in Townhead, Hamilton. The
charge for releasing the car was Pounds 45.
Lord Hope said he had every sympathy with those whose land was used for
parking without permission, but the methods used in this case fell within
the proper limits of the crime of extortion 'since the whole purpose of the
wheel clamping was to obtain money as a condition of the release of the
vehicle'.
Lord Hope added: 'In short, it is illegal for vehicles to be held to ransom
in the manner described in these charges, and those who are proved to have
done so are guilty of attempted extortion or, if the levy has been paid, of
the completed crime of extortion.'
The judgment, which does not apply in England and Wales, was welcomed by the
Automobile Association, which has been pressing for a code of conduct for
private clamping companies. It described the law in England as 'very
confused', adding that 'We are still waiting for a precedent.'
Mr Philip Bell consultant to the Wigan-based Nationwide Parking Control, the
company involved in Mrs Cook's case, said yesterday the Scottish case would
not affect the position in England and Wales.
Wheel clamping was the only way of protecting landowners' rights over their
own land, he said. 'It is now accepted practice, however disliked or
unpopular it is', he said. He added, however, that his company was in favour
of a code of conduct and had been in close conversation with the AA about it
in recent weeks.
Private clamping companies are not allowed to put the 'Denver Boot' on cars
illegally parked on the highway. The Department of Transport said the only
people with authority to clamp on the highway were the Metropolitan Police.
The 1991 Road Traffic Act will give local authority parking attendants power
to clamp, but it has not yet come into force.

   RIO DE JANEIRO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NEVER BEFORE and probably never again will so many world leaders have
assembled in one place.
From the US president to the emir of Kuwait, from the German chancellor to
the Chinese prime minister and the ruler of Monaco, 117 of them were there
to give their views on how to save the planet.
Photographers at the Rio Earth Summit hardly knew which way to turn as they
tried to snap the parade of men in African tribal robes, resplendent
military uniforms or Islamic dress, as well as leaders of Europe's new
countries and of little known places such as Kiribati and Vanuatu. Whispers
of 'Who's that?' and 'Where's that?' pervaded the balmy air.
Depending on wealth and importance, the leaders arrived by fleets of private
aircraft or charter flights. Thailand's glamorous Princess Chulabhorn easily
took the record for most baggage (140 cases) and the Americans brought in
their own mineral water. Rio airport ran out of parking space.
Everyone got a grand reception at the airport. The prime minister of Tuvalu
joined the queue for passport control, commenting to an aide that 'Someone
important must be arriving', not realising that the reception committee was
for him.
For two days Rio was a city under siege, with a strict security cordon in
place. Many roads were closed. The city awoke to the sound of sirens of 116
motorcades, watched by 40,000 soldiers and policemen, many of whom appeared
to have the safety catches off their guns.
Presiding over it all was Brazil's President Fernando Collor who could
hardly keep the grin off his face. Until three years ago he was a political
nobody, barely known outside his home state of Alagoas in the country's poor
north-east. Now Mr Collor had achieved his moment of glory.
The grin had slipped a little by late morning as he tried valiantly to keep
so many egos under control and restrict speeches to the allotted seven
minutes. When Cuba's Fidel Castro mounted the rostrum there were gales of
laughter as Mr Collor warned that speeches were overrunning. Don Fidel is
not known for his brevity. But yesterday he was on his best behaviour,
delivering one of the day's shortest speeches.
Dressed in his usual khaki uniform, he was in ebullient form, punching the
air as he crossed the plenary to carry the banner of the socialist
revolution, these days a rather lonesome task.
The world's most famous beard called for 'the end of selfishness and
hegemony, selfishness and deceit', blaming the world's environmental
problems on 'imperialist policies'.
Chancellor Kohl appeared not to be listening, but one African leader whipped
out a video camera to film the event. It was the first time Mr Bush and Mr
Castro had been in the same room.
Mr Castro's spirited speech came as light relief amid 56 leaders spouting
worthy rhetoric about the future of life on earth and the measures they had
taken at home. Mr Li Peng treated everybody to a long list of statistics
about the Chinese economy and 'large-scale soil improvement programmes'; the
Europeans disappointed everyone by failing to open their wallets.

Wall Street
A MORNING rally on Wall Street on the back of an auspicious inflation report
ran out of steam as trading died down ahead of the weekend, writes Karen
Zagor in New York.
At the close of trading, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 2.85 at
3,354.36 after climbing more than 25 points in the morning. Turnover tapered
off in the afternoon, with fewer than 183m shares changing hands on the day.
Advancing issues led declines by 1008 to 671.
Other market indices showed similar gains, with the Standard &amp; Poors 500
adding 0.71 to 409.76, the Nasdaq composite advancing 1.84 to 569.52 and the
Amex composite firming 1.42 to 391.32.
The May consumer price index, which indicated that prices are increasing
very modestly, was welcome news to a market which has been battered this
week by a sharp drop in April's consumer borrowing and unexpectedly weak
retail sales for May.
Both stock and bond markets rallied in the morning following the release of
the consumer price index, which rose 0.1 per cent, or 0.2 per cent excluding
food and energy prices. Analysts had expected an increase of about 0.3 per
cent. The report sparked speculation that might encourage the Federal
Reserve might ease monetary policy.
In the bond market, the treasury's benchmark 30-year bond was quoted 9/32
higher at 101 21/32 , to yield 7.88 per cent in late trading.
Strong gains in a number of heavily-traded blue chip stocks contributed to
the morning's rally. IBM advanced Dollars 1 on the day to Dollars 93,
Citicorp rose Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 20 1/2 , Philip Morris improved
Dollars 2 to Dollars 74 3/8 and Chrysler added Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 20
1/4 .
Among featured issues, Unisys slipped Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 8 5/8 in
active trading. A Dollars 300m issue of the company's convertible notes was
priced to yield 8.25 per cent.
The transportation sector regained some of its recent losses, with the Dow
Jones Transportation Average climbing 14.39 to 1,346.23.
AMR, parent of American Airlines, firmed Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 63 3/4 ,
Delta Air Lines rose Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 58 3/4 and United Airlines was
Dollars 1 1/2 higher at Dollars 117 1/4 .
Stocks of securities companies improved after having fallen earlier in the
week amid concern that the equity market might be heading for a correction
and concern about interest rates, improved.
Salomon added Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 32 1/2 , Merrill Lynch rose Dollars 1
1/4 to Dollars 47 and Morgan Stanley held steady at Dollars 48 5/8 .
In Nasdaq trading, shares in Ross Cosmetics tumbled Dollars 9 1/2 to Dollars
5, after the company said that it was the subject of an informal Securities
and Exchange Commission investigation. Harmonia Bancorp rose Dollars 2 5/8
to a 52-week high of Dollars 17 7/8 on news that it had agreed to merge with
Sovereign Bancorp in a cash and stock transaction.
Canada
TORONTO posted a solid gain in moderate trading, closing at 3,407.98, up
22.61 points. On the week, the composite index gained about 16 points.
Advances led declines by 353 to 206. Volume was 23.47m shares, and trading
value was CDollars 254m.

FT  13 JUN 92 / World Stock Markets: Sweden stands out amid troubled Nordic
bourses - Robert Taylor discerns positive investor sentiment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Denmark's unexpected, if narrow rejection of the Maastricht treaty in its
national referendum on June 2 continues to have a negative impact on stock
market performance in Scandinavia.
It would be an exaggeration to suggest that the Danish 'no', in itself, will
inflict long-term damage on what is already a rather fragile and uncertain
outlook. But with the Nordic countries about to start their traditionally
prolonged summer holidays, most analysts expect a period of trading in the
doldrums before any hope of a pick-up in the early autumn.
The Nordics are much more sensitive than they used to be to changes in the
wider global market, now that their currencies are all pegged to Ecu, and
negotiations are set to begin on their EC membership applications early next
year.
Some strategists think that concerns over the likely strength of the
American economic recovery this summer, and uncertainties about prospects in
Germany, the Nordics' main trading partner, could be more important than the
Danish Maastricht decisions among the external factors affecting the Nordic
bourses.
However, internal factors could make Sweden, in particular, more attractive
to foreign investors as the old restrictions on company share ownership are
dismantled - part of the necessary adaptation to membership of the 19-nation
European Economic Area (EEA) from next January.
International interest was already evident last year when foreigners were
net buyers of SKr11bn worth of Swedish stock in Stockholm, and analysts
believe that figure could go as high as SKr20bn in 1992.
Since its abolition of the turnover tax on dealings last November, soon
after taking office, Sweden's non-socialist government has persisted with an
ambitious programme of deregulation and liberalisation.
Government permission is no longer required for foreigners who want to buy
above a specific maximum figure equity and voting rights in Swedish
companies, while this summer an increasing number of Swedish listed
companies have decided to abolish the traditional distinction between free
and restricted shares, which protects up to 70 per cent of stocks in
Stockholm from foreign buyers.
Analysts also point to some definite signs of improvement in the Swedish
economy which has gone through its severest recession since before the
second world war.
The annual inflation rate is down to around two per cent, one of the lowest
in Western Europe. Private savings are going up, and costs are coming down
sharply.
Mr Colin Gibson, at Carnegie International, sees evidence of an export-led
recovery in Sweden which should gather strength during 1993, even if recent
forecasts indicate a lower domestic growth rate than expected.
Analysts are concerned - as is Sweden's central bank - about a burgeoning
budget deficit which is set to climb to over SKr110bn, seven per cent of
GNP.
But Mrs Anne Wibble, Sweden's finance minister, is well aware of that
problem and made it clear earlier this week she intends to make a reduction
in the size of the debt her highest priority.
What excites many analysts about the Swedish corporate scene is the sign of
improvement in the performance of Sweden's blue chip manufacturing
companies. Share values in the mechanical engineering sector have risen
impressively by over 34 per cent so far this year.
During the past two years many Swedish companies, paricularly in that
sector, have carried through successful re-structuring programmes which have
reduced their cost levels and improved their industrial performance.
James Capel is particularly impressed by SKF, the world's largest
roller-bearing company, which is expecting to make an SKr1bn profit this
year after losses of a similar figure in 1991. But other well-known
multinationals, like Electrolux, Sandvik and Atlas Copco, are also reviving
and there is hope that Volvo has begun a recovery in the vital American auto
market.
The Stockholm bourse is also taking a considerable interest in the Swedish
government's planned privatisation programme. Last week, it was announced
that there had been an oversubscription for shares in SSAB (Swedish Steel),
which is the first company wholly to be privatised. Procordia, the
pharmaceutical and food conglomerate, is also performing well with the
expectation of an early sell-off by the state of its minority shareholding
in the company.
However, this does guarantee that Stockholm is on the verge of a powerful
revival. The banking sector continues to be hit very hard by loan losses
with a 32 per cent fall in their share values since the beginning of the
year. This week, Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken, Sweden's largest commercial
bank, was unable to prevent a sharp fall in its shares after a four-month
deficit for the first time in its history.
Moreover, real estate and construction in Sweden continues to give
understandable anxiety with a 28 per cent decline in share values since the
start of 1992 and the bottom may not yet have been reached in that sector.

FT  13 JUN 92 / London Stock Exchange: Fisons warning stuns
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON JOEL KIBAZO and COLIN MILLHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DEALERS were stunned by the profits warning emanating from Fisons and
quickly responded by hacking the share price in an attempt to stave off
panic selling.
The extent of the market's unhappiness with Fison's management was made
quite clear by the size and persistence of the selling pressure which
continued to drive the share price lower as the session wore on.
There had been no early warning signals to the market that profits had
collapsed so quickly. Analysts scurried away to rework their profits numbers
for the current and following years after the revelations announced by Mr
Patrick Egan, Fisons' chairman.
At the close, the shares were 100 lower at 245p, having touched 236p earlier
in the session. Turnover reached 41m shares. Dealers, stunned by the waves
of selling pressure hitting the market all day, said the shares would
probably come under more pressure next week. 'It's got to the stage where a
bid for the company would probably win acceptance from the institutions in
record time,' said one senior dealer.
AP Ports collapse
A clutch of profit downgradings, including one from its broker sent shares
in the UK's largest ports operator Associated British Ports tumbling, which
affected sentiment in several other transport related stocks.
By the close, the shares had fallen a mighty 66 to 344p, and had traded even
lower during the session. Cazenove, the company's broker led the
downgradings but cuts in profit estimates also came from UBS Philips &amp; Drew
and Smith New Court, which reduced its current year estimate by Pounds 12.5m
to Pounds 55, and the following year's figure by Pounds 11.4m to Pounds 67m.
Mr Clive Anderson at Smith said: 'We concluded that conditions in the ports
business in the first half appeared flat, and we are not aware of
significant property disposals so far.'
Poor sentiment resulting from the downgradings weakened a number of
transport related stocks. These included NFC 6 lighter at 247p, and Ocean
Group, down 9 at 274p. However, worries about the property sector and vague
talk about likely downgradings that sent P&amp;O falling 28 to 460p.
BP setback
BP suffered one of the biggest individual falls among the FT-SE 100
constituents, with the shares closing 10 off at 261p, albeit in thin trading
of 4.7m shares, after Strauss Turnbull, the French-owned stockbroker with an
exceptional reputation for calling the turn in the stock, posted a sell sign
over the shares.
Mr John Toalster, Strauss's 'big oil' guru, cast doubts over the potential
of Cusiana, BP's big new oil discovery in Colombia, and said a dividend cut
by BP is deemed to be essential to conserve cash, restrict the rise in
gearing and provide a breathing space to devise a survival strategy for the
1990's.
The Strauss analyst summed up a dismal review of BP by saying: 'In stock
market terms the recent short-lived rally has presented investors with an
ideal opportunity to sell at an attractive price prior to another
substantial downward rating.'
The scene in the housebuilding area of the market was described by one
leading marketmaker as an 'absolute massacre,' after Mr Colin Parsons,
chairman of Taylor Woodrow, one of the UK's biggest housebuilding groups,
warned of a reduction in its dividend payment.
Taylor Woodrow shares, unsettled for some time, fell 10 to 94p and
spearheaded a general plunge by a building sector seen to be on the run all
week after a series of analysts' profits downgrades.
In a general rout which drove many share prices to all-time lows, George
Wimpey shares dropped 14 to 151p, Costain 5 to 52p, John Mowlem 9 to 120p,
Wilson Connolly 8 1/2 to 179p and Wilson Bowden 18 to 405p. YJ Lovell
dropped to 8p at one point before stabilising and closing a net 7 off at
11p. Persimmon dropped 26 to 257p.
Broker BZW was reported to have advised investors to sell British Steel. The
shares ended 2 1/2 lower at 71p as turnover reached 6.5m. Poor presentations
at British Aerospace earlier in the week, leading to concern about the
company's financial future, continued to dog the shares. They retreated 17
to 302p, though turnover at 1.5m was light.
A Smith New Court profits downgrading in Simon Engineering left the shares
16 lighter at 252p.
Mr Ian Lowe at the broker reduced his current year forecast by 10.1 per cent
to Pounds 16.9m and said: 'Profits for the first half are likely to be
around 52 per cent below last year's level.'
A savage profits downgrading in Vickers sent the shares sliding 15 to 155p.
SG Warburg cut current year estimate by a hefty Pounds 22m to Pounds 18m. Mr
Rob Golding at the securities house blamed continuing weakness in the
Rolls-Royce cars and Cosworth divisions.
Tesco improved 7 1/2 to 276 1/2 p. It was the best performing Footsie stock
on a generally dull day, as the market decided that the price/earnings
differential between it and J. Sainsbury had widened too far and that Tesco
was due for correction after being the weakest of the big three supermarket
groups recently. Sainsbury hardened a penny to 458p, while Argyll Group
slipped a similar amount to 352p.
Trading in Asda was below the recent high level, but the shares remained
quite active on turnover of 6.2m, easing  3/4 to 33 1/2 p, as the market
continued to digest the implications of a flotation by MFI, in which Asda
has a 25 per cent stake.
Among food manufacturers Hillsdown lost 7 to 166p, but traders said this was
not the result of any fundamental shift in the market, but was more likely
to represent a badly handled selling order. Northern Foods continued to
benefit from reaction to this week's good results, rising 3 to 617p.
There was some relief in the stores sector that the aggressive DIY sector
does not appear to be continuing its price war this weekend. Kingfisher,
holding company of B&amp;Q, and recently suffering from price cutting in the DIY
division, rallied 6 to 521p as traders decided that the price had probably
gone too low.
Dixons continued to suffer from fears of price discounting in the retail
sector, after Thursday's warning about a sales setback in the CBI's
distributive trades survey. The shares fell 6 to 251p.
Property worries at Ladbroke caused the shares to lose 9 1/2 to 213 1/2 p.
Bid speculation lifted regional brewer Devenish 9 to 278p, while its
potential predator Boddington remained steady at 181p.
Bank shares rounded off a thoroughly unhappy week with further losses, still
weakened by Standard &amp; Poor's shift of its long term credit ratings for
Barclays, NatWest and Royal Bank of Scotland. Barclays fell 7 more to 342p,
NatWest 9 to 329p, and Lloyds 8 to 417p.
Tobacco companies were firmer as the market awaited a US Supreme Court
ruling on smoking related diseases. BAT Industries gained 4 to 778p and
Rothmans 'B' rose 14 to 1103p, after County NatWest argued that even if the
judgment went against the tobacco companies it only gave plaintiffs the
right to have cases heard by jury. Nothing will have been settled in terms
of actual liability.

FT  13 JUN 92 / International Company News: Stock exchanges may share NY
building
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE New York and American stock exchanges, fierce rivals for nearly a
century, are considering a tentative developer's proposal to build a
headquarters on Wall Street which would house both institutions.
The idea is being floated by JP Morgan, the large New York bank, and would
involve building a new tower on a site adjacent to the current New York
Stock Exchange building. The site is now partly occupied by Morgan's former
headquarters.
Mr William Strauss, chief financial officer of the American exchange, said
'creating a financial hub in lower Manhattan makes a lot of sense to us'.
But he added that Morgan had not yet presented any economic evaluation of
the scheme and no active discussions were taking place.
The scheme envisages the two exchanges remaining separate institutions, with
their own trading floors. But it could pave the way for a sharing of
functions to cut costs and is likely to prompt speculation about an eventual
merger between the two institutions.
Both the New York exchange and its much smaller rival face increasing
competition from electronic dealing systems which do not require a physical
trading floor.
If the project were to go ahead, the new building would not be ready for
occupation until near the end of the century.
The scheme would demand a large package of aid from the New York city and
state governments, but in return might help stem a gradual drift of business
away from the financial district in lower Manhattan and reinforce the area's
role as the world's leading financial centre.

FT  13 JUN 92 / International Company News: PacTel considers sale of 8 UK
cable franchises
</HEADLINE>

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PACIFIC Telesis, one of the regional telecommunications companies which
resulted from the break-up of American Telephone &amp; Telegraph, said yesterday
it was considering selling its eight cable franchises in the UK.
PacTel claimed to be entertaining the move so that it could 'focus solely on
its wireless telecommunications business'. 'We still find the UK cable TV
market attractive,' commented Mr Lee Cox, PacTel's chief executive, 'but we
want to concentrate our efforts on winning more valuable cellular and paging
licences abroad.'
The company, based in Walnut Creek, California, is currently pursuing
cellular licences in a range of countries - from Japan and Hong Kong to
Greece and Spain in continental Europe. Its parent, Pacific Telesis Group is
also studying proposals which could involve spinning off the Pacific Bell
and Nevada Bell phone operations, but yesterday's announcement was said to
be independent of this.
PacTel suggested that it was flexible about how it restructured the UK cable
franchises - with options under consideration ranging from an outright sale,
to some form of joint venture deal. Officials said that preliminary talks
with potential purchasers or partners had already taken place.
PacTel built up its UK cable TV franchises in the late 1980s. Of the eight
to be 'restructured', four are operational - in the Peterborough, Bolton,
Derby and Norwich areas - with around 10,000 subscribers. The other licences
are in Manchester, Doncaster and several smaller cities. In total, the
company is licensed to serve about 1m homes.
It recently sold its east London cable properties to BCE Telecom
International, for an undisclosed amount.

FT  13 JUN 92 / International Company News: Stora blames price cuts for
sharp fall in profits

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
STORA, Europe's largest paper and pulp group, yesterday announced a steep
fall in profits for the first four months of 1992 following a drop in sales
from SKr18.3bn (Dollars 3.18bn) to SKr16.2bn. Profits after net financial
items were SKr3m against SKr901m for the same period of 1991.
The company warned it would suffer a loss in the second four-month period
but added that its programme to cut costs combined with an improved market
should enable profits to improve in the final four months of 1992.
The company blamed sharp price cuts for the sharp profits fall. These
applied to most forestry industry related products, the result of severe
competition in a depressed market which produced a loss of SKr1.2bn. Also,
construction-related revenues fell SKr300m, while there was a fall in net
financial items because of lower interest differentials caused by linking
the Swedish kroner to the European currency unit in May 1991.
The company made actual operating losses in the first four months of SKr149m
in pulp and SKr119m in printing papers, compared with profits of SKr56m and
SKr226m respectively. Stora's operating profit for packaging board and paper
was SKr465m, against SKr470m.
Esselte, the office equipment group, has reported a steep increase in
profits for the first four months of 1992, despite reduced turnover. After
net financial items, profits jumped to SKr140m from SKr63m a year ago. Sales
were SKr4.49bn, against SKr5.31bn.
Esselte forecasts full-year profits after net financial items of SKr350m.
Hit by restructuring costs the group made a loss of SKr416m last time.

earnings

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MONSANTO, the US chemicals group, said current results show that
second-quarter earnings may be 20 to 30 per cent below Wall Street analysts'
estimates of Dollars 1.60 to Dollars 1.80 a share, Reuter reports from St.
Louis.
The company said Wall Street had been reducing estimates to that range in
recent weeks.
Monsanto cited costs associated with the launch of its Searle unit's new
anti-infectant drug Maxaquin, inventory reductions for its hypertension drug
Calan and additional costs related to a January plant explosion in Texas.
Mr Nicholas Filippello, chief economist for Monsanto, declined to quantify
the specific financial impact of the three developments.
This year's first-quarter earnings slipped to Dollars 161m or Dollars 1.26 a
share, from Dollars 166m or Dollars 1.31 a year earlier.

SHARES IN Whitecroft, the building products, lighting and textiles group,
fell sharply again yesterday following its profit warning and change in
dividend policy.
The shares fell 20p to 72p, following their drop from 131p on Thursday.
The company intends to cut its final dividend to 0.7p. This compares to the
7.7p forecast when it announced interim results in December and at the time
of its rights issue last year.
Profits for the year to March 31, to be released next Tuesday, will be at
the bottom end of market expectations, it said. Forecasts have ranged from
Pounds 4.5m to Pounds 5m.
Mr Peter Goold, chairman, said the decisions were made following a review of
prospects for this year.
An expected fall in value of the property portfolio will be provided for as
an extraordinary item.

<TEXT>
Morland, the Oxfordshire-based brewer facing a hostile bid from Greene King,
has announced a brewing and marketing tie-up with Courage which it claimed
could earn it Pounds 800,000 a year in profits,
Morland will sell Courage at least 5,000 barrels each year of Old Speckled
Hen, its premium cask beer. Morland will also brew 20,000 barrels per year
of Courage beers and make its products more available.
The agreement, which is planned to last five years, is subject to Greene
King's bid lapsing or being withdrawn.

FT  13 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Investors could be spoiled for choice -
Richard Gourlay looks at the spate of impending stock exchange flotations
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
INVESTORS LOOKING for some excitement will be spoiled for choice from the
raft of new companies about to be floated on the stock exchange.
Those with memories that stretch back to the pre-big bang spate of
flotations may remember that they frequently either went spectacularly well
or were comprehensive flops.
This time around, the flotations are likely to be different. In the first
place, the size is generally significantly larger than those in the mid
1980s.
Many of them, like GPA, Wellcome and 3i are long established companies
rather than new entities that have grown rapidly and are coming to market
with relatively little following.
In short, the markets and the companies are likely to be better understood
and pricing should be more competitive - that is to say, there will be less
opportunity for huge premiums after flotation.
In that sense, analysts say, many of the flotations will resemble recent
privatisations where the companies generally operated in known markets with
known managements.
From the companies' point of view, many will be floating to reduce
management buy-out gearing and to allow managements to emerge from under the
shadow of personal guarantees secured on their houses to an altogether
rosier world.
But for others there is a very 1990s motivation. As the economy moves into
recovery, they are being forced to finance their growth from internal
resources as the big banks' are far less willing to lend. There is no
central register of flotations so the chart belowmay not be comprehensive.

FT  13 JUN 92 / UK Company News: A Cohen shares fall by 25p
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares of A Cohen, maker of non-ferrous metal ingots, fell 25p to 375p
yesterday as profits continued to decline in the second half and the
dividend was cut.
The pre-tax profit for 1991 dropped from Pounds 2.03m to Pounds 783,000, on
turnover of Pounds 83.7m (Pounds 88.8m).
After tax of Pounds 1.13m (Pounds 1.33m) there were losses per share of
21.2p (earnings 43.5p). The final is cut to 3.4p leaving the total at 10p,
against 23.1p.
The severity of the recession was exacerbated by big exports of secondary
aluminium from the former Soviet Union.

FT  13 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Construction shaken by Taylor Woodrow
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARE PRICES of construction companies dived yesterday after Taylor Woodrow,
one of the biggest companies in the sector, warned that dividends would be
reduced considerably this year due to lower-than-expected profits.
Mr Colin Parsons, chairman, speaking at the group's annual meeting, said
that there was no sign of the deep recession ending in the UK housing and
commercial property market.
He warned that cashflow remained under pressure. Borrowings as a result were
likely to increase during the rest of this year.
In an attempt to generate cash the company was planning to sell Greenham
Construction Materials, a small aggregates business. It would also be
looking to make further reductions in staff as well as cutting other
overheads.
Taylor Woodrow's shares fell 10p to 94p following the warning. The price
compares with an issue price of 200p in April last year when the company
raised Pounds 162.4m in a rights issue.
It was the second time this week that a chairman of a large construction
group had issued a profits warning. On Tuesday Sir Eric Pountain, chairman
of Tarmac, Britain's biggest housebuilder and a large building materials
group, warned the group could have made a loss in the first half of this
year.
Tarmac's share price yesterday fell 5p to 115p as other construction stocks
took fright from Taylor Woodrow's warning. Costain fell 5p to 52p while of
John Mowlem was down 9p to 120p.
Mr Mark Stockdale, construction analyst at SG Warburg who attended
yesterday's annual meeting, said: 'Trading conditions are even worse than we
had thought. A number of contractors are likely to be under severe pressure
to cut dividends this year. There is a strong possibility that company share
prices will fall even further.
'We had been forecasting Taylor Woodrow would make about Pounds 37m pre-tax
profit this year. Clearly it is now going to be less than that,' he said,
adding that forecasts were likely to be downgraded for other construction
companies.
At the time of the rights Taylor Woodrow said it needed the cash to take
advantage of opportunities provided by the recession to acquire housing and
commercial property assets at favourable prices.
Since then its fortunes have slipped. The group last year made pre-tax loss
of Pounds 2.7m after exceptional provisions of Pounds 46.5m to cover
potential losses on construction contracts and write-downs of property
assets.
Three months ago Mr Parsons, previously head of Taylor Woodrow's Canadian
operations replaced Mr Peter Drew as chairman. Mr Parsons told shareholders
yesterday that one of his first tasks had been to 'carry out a number of
changes at board level to clarify decision making process and provide a
clear allocation of responsibility.'

FT  13 JUN 92 / Letter: Names should fight levy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr STEVEN A PARNES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Despite all the adverse publicity and the personal ruin of thousands of
Names, the Council of Lloyd's has found a way out of its problems by
increasing the central fund by levying Names. There is no suggestion that
underwriting agents, members' agents or brokers should suffer a levy
themselves.
It would appear that the 'cannon fodder' can be relied upon to 'cough up'
still more money for the excesses, incompetence and ineptitude of the
underwriting agents, members' agents and brokers. Central fund levying may
be appropriate if these bodies were also asked to contribute significantly;
instead we read that many underwriters' pay at Lloyd's is in the many
hundreds of thousands of pounds and syndicate expenses have been frozen.
I believe Names should fight this central fund levy proposal with bitter
determination. Steven A Parnes,

FT  13 JUN 92 / Euro Disney: The Story So Far - A question of the mouse's
attraction
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE EURO DISNEY fantasy has so far enticed 1.5m holidaymakers. However, this
buoyant beginning conceals worries about its longer-term prospects.
European capitals report interest and substantial initial bookings but
selling this US culture experience to Europeans will become more difficult
as economic uncertainty continues and winter approaches.
In the UK, P&amp;O Euro-Ferries said the first three months' packages have 'sold
so well that we had to go back to Euro Disney to ask for greater hotel room
allocation'. P&amp;O added that it has sold more than 70 per cent of its
packages for the first three months, and that bookings for the peak summer
months are at that level.
The UK operator Airtours declined to give monthly figures for sales but said
that it had sold 70 per cent of its allocations up to December.
The UK coach operator Wallace Arnold has an allocation of 25,000 packages up
to March 1993. It said that so far 14,000 have been sold. It would not give
a monthly breakdown. Other UK operators also declined to give details of
monthly bookings but stated they were achieving 70 per cent of their target.
British Airways Holidays (a subsidiary of British Airways) said that
'bookings are exceeding our budget for June and will probably be the same in
July and August'.
However, BA Holidays added that, so far, September is 'considerably
quieter', with less than 20 per cent of its projected bookings being taken
up. BA Holidays' figures for the last two months of 1992 are even lower:
November, 12 per cent and December, 10 per cent. Bookings for the start of
1993 are lower still.
BA Holidays said: 'We don't think it's going to be easy trying to market
Euro Disney in the winter but we have to persuade people of the attraction
of not having any queues then.' It added: 'So long as people dress up warmly
and make sure they are waterproofed' then a wintery Eurodisney might not be
unattractive.
It is perhaps no coincidence that tour operators claim to be achieving a 70
per cent sales target, yet are reluctant to give monthly breakdowns.
Euro Disney yesterday confirmed that part of its agreement with designated
tour operators is that the operators guarantee fulfilling their allocated
hotel room quotas by 70 per cent; if they fail to achieve that, then they,
not Euro Disney, are liable for the cost of the vacant hotel rooms.
In France, the consensus among operators and travel agents is that interest
was high immediately after the park's opening, but has since declined.
Mr Jean Luc Durovraz, director of development at VPS Voyages, one of
France's largest coach operators, said: 'After very strong interest in the
first few weeks' sales and advance bookings had fallen by 'about 20 or 30
per cent' since the middle of May.
RATP, operating the railway link between Paris and the theme park, supports
that. Its daily ticket sales to Euro Disney (to both French and foreign
travellers) peaked in late April and early May - reaching a record of 26,000
on Saturday May 2 - but has since fallen.
Mr Durovraz said it was too early to say whether the recent reduction in
demand reflected a long-term disenchantment with Euro Disneyland, or if it
was due to seasonal factors like the recent profusion of national holidays
in France.
Mr Jean Pierre Bouteillier, marketing director of Visit France, the tour
operator owned by Air France, said the present level of interest in Euro
Disneyland was 'satisfactory', but added that his company had 'absolutely no
idea what to expect' from it.
Mr Durovraz suspects that Euro Disney may have a longer term problem, in
that it is trying to sell a US leisure concept incompatible with French
leisure trends. French consumers 'are uncomfortable with the US idea of
spending a lot of money on a one-day trip to a single site.'
Spanish travel agents have only recently begun a concerted campaign to sell
Euro Disney. The two largest hotel and travel operations say interest has
exceeded their expectations.
'It could not be better,' said Ms Rosa Paramio, chief of planning at the
Corte Ingles agency. She was, nevertheless, unable to give precise figures.
At Eurodisney Utell, a Spanish hotel agency specialising in Euro Disney
reservations, Ms Avelina Iglesias said she had been 'very surprised' at the
rate of bookings for Euro Disney hotels.
But Euro Disney will in the next few years face competition from a Dollars
500m theme park being built near Barcelona by Anheuser Busch and a Catalan
financier, Mr Javier de la Rosa.

complex been in capturing the imagination and money of a continent? FT

<TEXT>
IT IS 8.30am, a Sunday on the French Whitsun holiday weekend at the
Disneyland Hotel, a fanciful new 'turn of the century' pink confection where
child or adult guests can be tucked into bed by Mickey Mouse.
Just outside, costumed cast members - Disneyese for workers - are taking up
their positions beside the turnstiles at the entrance to the Magic Kingdom,
Euro Disney's new FFr2.4bn (Pounds 244m) theme park 20 miles east of Paris.
Above, in one of the Disney hotel restaurants, Rotterdam snooker hall owner
Mr Lucos van Straalen and his wife Henny are ploughing through the
FFr140-a-head breakfast.
'The second we've finished this we'll be out there and you'll be first on
the rides,' Mr van Straalen assures his seven-year-old son Kim.
Then he looks out; the crowds are already surging down Main Street USA, past
its 'Victorian shop' merchandising opportunities towards Sleeping Beauty's
Castle and the make-believe beyond.
Attendance this sunny holiday Sunday - 90,000 say cast members - ought to be
good news for Euro Disney which confirmed earlier this month that 'operating
uncertainties' meant it might not be profitable this financial year. Theme
park attendances and hotel occupancy had 'fluctuated considerably' since the
April 12 opening.
The seven-week total of 1.5m theme park visitors, an average of slightly
more than 30,000 daily, would if replicated over 52 weeks achieve the
company's 11m a year target.
But Euro Disney must boost summer attendances; visitors will be much scarcer
on cold, short winter days. A 'one night free for two nights paying' offer
at its six hotels at the resort has been introduced for a limited period for
visitors not already on discounted package deals.
Yet even after Sunday's high turnout management were refusing to be
interviewed or to confirm the 90,000 figure, their highest in a single day.
In truth Sunday was not a triumph; although the gates closed for four hours
to 3pm to limit admissions it was already too late to prevent Euro
Disneyland falling short of the maxim enshrined in its 'The Magic is You'
staff brochure; 'Exceeding our guests' expectations is our ultimate goal
each and every day.'
'It was dreadful, quite impossible; two hours wait to go on a ride is
ridiculous,' says ambulance driver Mr Jean-Jacques Siuda, one of four adults
and three children from Perpignan, southern France, who have flown up for
two nights at Euro Disneyland. 'We gave up and came back to the hotel
swimming pool; I wouldn't mind but at home we have the sea.'
The van Straalens, appalled at the queues but too scared to head for Paris -
'French is a difficult language for us' - drove instead to the Asterix theme
park. Not so good, they say, but quieter.
Dusseldorf catering worker Mr Markos Weggen, who had come by train with
friends for two days, went to Paris for a few hours. Mr Weggen, sporting a
cowboy style neckerchief, has been to Walt Disney World in Orlando, Florida.
'They're better organised out there; they've some way to go in organisation
here,' he said.
Yet apart from their frustration at the queues all these people said that,
overall, they had a great time.
In many respects the project has been a feat of organisation; the
three-phase development is due to cover 4,801 acres, a fifth the size of
central Paris, by 2017. Upgraded road and rail links to the site are
impressive and high-speed TGV trains will from 1994 further shrink journey
times for its 340m European catchment population.
Whatever one thinks of the site's gaudy buildings, relentless jollity and
shameless bastardisation of history and culture, the scale of work since
contracts were signed in 1987 is awesome. As well as the theme park there
are six new hotels with 5,200 beds, ranging from the Hotel Cheyenne, a
pastiche Wild West town, to the New York, loosely based on Manhattan, and
the 'Victorian' Disneyland.
Yet vital details of strategy seem unsatisfactory. Visitors complain about
poor signs at railway stations and roads feeding the resort. Some large
travel agents in Britain, an important market, lack information on the
resort.
These deficiencies, and the queues, may just be teething problems. But Euro
Disney has a fight on its hands to overcome anti-American prejudice, fear of
traffic jams and sensitivity to the park's FFr225 (FFr150 for three to under
12s) one-day admission charge among the French.
The company declines to confirm unofficial information that the level of
French visitor throughput is well below forecasts. However, it is trying to
boost local attendances. This may be an uphill struggle.
'It's American kitsch on French soil,' says a French middle class
white-collar worker at his house in Marne la Vallee, the new town
development zone where Euro Disneyland is located.
'The Frenchman is an individualist, he hates being taken by the hand and led
around.'
Eight miles away, Leeds David Moutrie, his wife Michelle and their two small
children are ordering a FFr200-a-head meal at Walts restaurant. They are
about to discover they cannot have a glass of wine; no alcohol is served in
the theme park.
'The same Frenchman who'll go to Disney in Orlando and come back telling his
neighbours it's fantastic will describe Euro Disney in Marne la Vallee as a
cultural Chernobyl,' says Mr Charles Boetto, president of the Syndicat
d'Agglomeration Nouvelle des Portes de la Brie, a local authority council
covering the five parishes around the Disney site.
An independent politically and a banker by career - he is a former assistant
vice-president of American Express in France - Mr Boetto wants Euro Disney
to succeed. His council has already borrowed FFr230m for infrastructure
upgrading around the site and is raising another FFr500m loan. But he also
wants the project to foster more broadly based economic expansion; he
worries about overdependence on tourism. The Euro Disney shares, he
believes, were overpriced due to speculation, but he fears their falling
value may frighten the banks, slowing development.
He is critical too of Euro Disney's handling of housing problems among its
16,000 full-time, part-time and short-term staff: the company blames a
mix-up with the French authorities. Mostly paid FFr6,000 gross for an
169-hour month of shift work - 15 per cent above the French minimum wage -
the bulk of the staff, drawn from 86 nationalities, can ill afford Parisian
rents.
Mr Boetto says the 6,000 population of his five parishes has been suddenly
swelled by 1,600 cast members. One tiny village, Magny le Hongre, now has a
population of 350 locals and 800 young newcomers.
Since April 1 more than 1,000 staff have left. 'A lot went because it was
chaotic at first,' says a genial English waitress at Festival Disney, a
charmless eating and drinking area just outside the park gates.
Among those who quit was a 22-year-old French medical student living nearby
who signed up for a weekend job.
After two weekends at the 'Disney University' - one for brainwashing, he
says, and one for training in till and credit card handling - he donned a
Tyrolean costume and started work in a Fantasyland shop for a pre-opening
weekend for subcontractors' families.
It was frantic, he says; he stood at his till 11 hours non-stop. The next
weekend virtually the entire shop personnel had changed. After 10 hours he
locked his till to go and eat. A French senior manager was unimpressed; a
row ensued. A brief career as a smiling Tyrolean was over.
A waiter in one of the best hotels - no names are revealed here as cast
members are forbidden from talking to journalists - says he believes Euro
Disney management are learning.
'I don't think they realised what Europeans were like, that we ask questions
and don't think all the same. But it's getting better; they're listening
more to the staff.'
Written Euro Disney Look rules for cast members are rigorous. The right
weight must be maintained, nails exceeding 7mm beyond the fingertip are
banned, deodorant is obligatory and wigs forbidden, except with doctor's
verification. Body language rules warn against crossing the arms, urge an
upright, listening posture and recommend sincere voice tone.
There is strong approval among visitors for the park's sparkling cleanliness
and lack of litter. Cast members are strikingly good natured, friendly to
visitors and, apparently, each other. 'I've never seen as many smiling
Frenchmen in one place,' laughs American Mr Todd Stephenson, completing a
PhD on 20th century American cultural history. His view on the Euro Disney
resort? 'It's a big mishmash'.
French visitors are a minority. Some are intimidated at being addressed in
English, especially in the hotels. 'Vous parlez francais?' asks an anxious
Frenchwoman, wandering forlornly down the Hotel Cheyenne's Wild West street.
She is seeking in vain a conventional French restaurant - American food is
another deterrent to French visitors.
Equally, some English speaking visitors complain about park commentaries in
French.
The hotel rooms are good but expensive. Prices for most of the year - from
FFr750 a room to FFr2,750 at the Disneyland Hotel - are however mitigated by
the fact that four can sleep in one room by current discount deals. Many
French visitors are aghast at the room prices but they are mostly day
trippers or staying at nearby business hotels at cut-price weekend rates.
Visitor spending varies dramatically. The Moutries' four-day, three-night
package, including return flight from Yorkshire, cost them Pounds 1,500,
including hotel and park admission. They will spend up to Pounds 700 more on
food, drink and incidentals. They were given free cowboy hats and a meal at
the Buffalo Bill Wild West Show. But it cost them FFr1,000 to get in.
Lingerie saleswomen Monique Tesniere and Josiane Montegu from Rouen have
paid just FFr300 each for a two-day, one-night package, including coach and
overnight stay in a Marne la Vallee business hotel.
There are few grumbles about the admission charge but French visitors
particularly talk of knowing many people deterred by cost.
Visitors do grumble though about the cost and choice of goods in the park
shops. 'I refuse to pay FFr49 for a little Mickey Mouse statue,' says
Parisian waitress Raymonde Bergon.
Euro Disney has keenly exploited its perceived sales opportunities, from
wheelchair hire to macs. But in one area - alcohol - it seems diffident.
The 1,100-room Newport Bay Club, for example, allegedly western Europe's
biggest hotel, has only one small bar. As the park is 'dry', drinkers
congregate at Festival Disney, supervised by unsmiling security men and CRS
riot police with guns. Euro Disney confirms it is unhappy with this area but
declines to give details.
The drink issue raises the question of quite who the resort is aimed at. Is
it for the small children who whimper in terror at the superb dragon
snorting beneath Sleeping Beauty's Castle? The adolescents who crave more
white-knuckle rides, such as Discoveryland's Star Tours voyage into space?
The adults who want a few beers, or more time to appreciate the high-quality
artwork of the Pirates of the Caribbean ride?
Can an American theme park in Europe please all ages and nationalities? And
in what country, if any, is this fantasy never-neverland which started with
a Hollywood mouse? It is not, except in the most literal sense, in France.
'I think as far as the management is concerned it just happens to be in the
middle of Europe handy for a big population,' says Mr Moutrie. 'If somebody
said to me when we get back, have you been to France, I'd be tempted to say
no.'

FT  13 JUN 92 / Major faces a growing clamour on Maastricht
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR John Major flies back to Britain today with his pledge to press ahead on
ratification of the Maastricht treaty in the autumn under attack from both
flanks.
Mr Paddy Ashdown, the Liberal Democrat leader, yesterday claimed that the
prime minister's commitment to the treaty appeared to be wavering following
reports of cabinet splits over how to respond to the Danish referendum 'no'
result.
But Mr Michael Spicer, Tory MP for South Worcestershire and a leading
opponent of the accord, warned that it might be unconstitutional for the
government to proceed with ratification.
The conflicting views reflected fierce divisions on all sides in the Commons
about how Britain should respond to the Danish rejection, both in parliament
and in the presidency of the European Community which the UK inherits from
Portugal next month.
To emphasise the point, a cross-party group including Mr John Biffen, the
former Conservative leader of the Commons, and Mr Peter Shore, a former
Labour environment secretary, yesterday re-tabled a symbolic bill requiring
a statement about the impact of a treaty on citizens' rights to be sent to
every household.
With Conservative supporters of the treaty unusually taciturn, it was Mr
Ashdown who put the case yesterday for a vigorous defence of the accord. He
argued that Mr Major should confront 'the whispering campaign of his Tory
opponents' directly by tabling a confidence motion on his European policy.
Mr Spicer, in a speech outlining a growing school of opinion among Tory MPs,
countered government claims of specific gains for Britain in the Maastricht
agreement. While the commission's powers had been redefined, the executive
had an enhanced role, including a right to propose what powers would be
'handed back' to national parliaments, he said.
THE Tory party is seeking a new chief executive as part of its review of
Conservative Central Office, its headquarters organisation, Ivo Dawnay
writes. The Pounds 90,000 post is open to applicants from both inside and
outside the party.
Sir Norman Fowler, party chairman, has also announced the appointment of two
advisers: Sir Allen Shephard, chairman of Grand Metropolitan, the food and
drinks group, and Mr Richard Simmons, a senior partner of Arthur Andersen,
the accountants and management consultants.

<TEXT>
SIR Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland Secretary, moved last night to
force the pace in talks taking place on the province's political future. He
proposed making a first step next week towards bringing the Irish government
into the negotiations.
After discussion in Belfast until late last night with local politicians,
Sir Patrick called for a meeting next week to start drawing up an agenda for
the second 'strand' of the talks, on relations between Northern Ireland and
the republic. These discussions would mean a historic meeting between
unionists and the Irish government.
His announcement appeared to be an attempt to sidestep the row between
nationalist and unionist leaders over the timing of the republic's entry
that has stalled progress in the seven-week old talks.
Sir Patrick said he was not proposing a formal start to strand two, and work
will continue on strand one - devolution in the province - from which the
republic is excluded.
Besides the Irish and the British governments, unionist and nationalist
leaders will be invited to next week's meeting. The independent chairman
will be Sir Ninian Stephen, former governor-general of Australia.
Sir Patrick also announced that work would begin on strand three about a
possible replacement to the 1985 Anglo-Irish agreement.

described as 'wholly unacceptable' the US action in preparing a Dollars 2bn
(Pounds 1.08bn) list of EC products it may target for high import tariffs.
He said the US would be acting illegally if the sanctions were put into
effect.
Two dispute settlement panels in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade
have found the EC at fault for subsidies of its oilseeds sector. The US
plans to invite comment on the list before paring it to Dollars 1bn and
implementing the tariffs.

FT  13 JUN 92 / Eurotunnel wins leave for appeal
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
EUROTUNNEL, the Channel tunnel group, has been given leave to appeal to the
House of Lords against a Court of Appeal ruling. The ruling allowed British
and French contractors to renew a threat to stop working unless they receive
extra payments to cover the cost of completing the project.
Transmanche Link, a consortium of five British and five French construction
companies, had said it would stop work on installing a cooling system unless
it received sufficient money to cover the cost of the work.
Eurotunnel had asked the courts to grant an injunction preventing the
contractors from carrying out their threat.
Lord Staughton, one of the appeal judges, said that an English court should
not grant an interim injunction in a disagreement that all the parties had
agreed ought to go to arbitration abroad.

FT  13 JUN 92 / Building workers agree 2.5% rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CONSTRUCTION unions yesterday agreed to accept a 2.5 per cent rise for basic
pay rates in negotiations covering 600,000 building and civil engineering
workers, Diane Summers writes.
The deal followed a warning by Ucatt, the main union in the talks, of a
'summer of discontent' on building sites if employers refused to withdraw
their proposal for a pay freeze.
The deal, which will take basic pay for craft operatives to Pounds 4.09 an
hour and for labourers to Pounds 3.48, takes effect from June 29. These
negotiated basic rates bear little relation to actual wages paid but do
influence the scale of increases contractors are likely to pay.
Separately, a survey of professional staff in the construction industry,
conducted by Building magazine, indicates that more than half of
construction companies will impose a pay freeze this year.
Fifteen per cent of companies will give rises of 1 per cent to 4 per cent
but just over a quarter expect to raise salaries between 5 per cent and 8
per cent after earlier pay freezes.

FT  13 JUN 92 / Opinion poll inquest sees fatal flaws
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD EVANS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN INQUEST into the performance of opinion polls in the general election has
provided an explanation for more than half the discrepancies between their
findings and the actual result. However, it says there are still
'fundamental problems' in the way polls are conducted.
The inquiry by the Market Research Society suggests that the polls have
systematically overstated Labour support and underestimated Tory strength
for at least 30 years. It will conduct further research to discover the
cause of this bias.
This investigation is likely to take several months and will focus on
representative interviews, the significance of people who refuse to answer
pollsters' questions, the reliability of those who do answer, and the
interpretation of data.
Yesterday's report, which will do little to restore the pollsters' dented
credibility, claims their 1992 election performance was 'not wholly
untypical' because of underlying problems with sampling and interviewing
methods.
An average of the four leading polls published on polling day showed an
overestimate of 4 per cent in the Labour vote, an underestimate of 4 1/2 per
cent for the Tories, and an overestimate of 1 per cent for the Liberal
Democrats. The net effect was to underestimate the Tories' winning margin by
8 1/2 points. The main factors in the miscalculation were found to be a late
swing that went unspotted, people's reluctance to say how they were going to
vote, the impact of postal votes, and voters failing to register because of
the poll tax.
Up to 3 points of the 8 1/2 point discrepancy was found to have been caused
by a last-minute change in voting intentions and up to 2 points by the
refusal of some people, especially Conservatives, to disclose their
intentions.
The report says: 'We feel we can now understand around 5 (points) of the
discrepancy between the polls and the result in terms of the Conservative
lead: around 60 per cent of the total problem. We are left with a
discrepancy of around 3.5 (points), arising from underestimation of the
Conservative vote and/or overestimation of the Labour vote.'
Mr Brian Gosschalk, political director of leading pollster Mori, said the
inquiry's conclusion that there was a long-term bias favouring Labour was
'nonsense'.
Mr Bob Worcester, Mori chairman, said there were no easy answers. 'It is far
too early to say what we will be doing differently in four years' time . . .
It makes us a bit more humble, which will do no harm at all.'

FT  13 JUN 92 / Inflation stands still at 4.3%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE rate of inflation was unchanged last month although the underlying
trends remained downward.
Fears that the headline inflation figure would be pushed up as last year's
mortgage-rate cuts dropped out of the retail prices index proved unfounded.
Instead, a 0.4 per cent rise in the RPI last month left the rate of increase
in the 12 months to May at 4.3 per cent, the same figure as in April.
Figures from the Central Statistical Office also show that the RPI excluding
mortgage interest payments - often taken as a measure of underlying retail
price inflation - fell to 5.3 per cent in the year to May, the lowest figure
since December 1988. This measure of retail-price inflation has fallen
steadily from 5.8 per cent in December.
The Treasury said the figures were 'excellent news', and forecast underlying
inflation would continue to fall in the coming months as weak producer-price
inflation fed through to the wider inflation index. Last month
producer-price inflation - the prices of manufactured goods  - fell to 3.6
per cent, the lowest annual rate of increase since 1987.
The RPI fell to 4 per cent in March but jumped to 4.3 per cent in April
after the Budget increases in excise duties. Economists expect the RPI to
resume its downward path later this year.
Ms Ruth Lea, chief economist at Mitsubishi Bank in London, said: 'Provided
the squeeze continues and service-sector inflation gets hit, the outlook on
inflation should be better by the second half of this year.'
A breakdown of the components of the index shows that prices in the service
sector continued to rise faster than in the traded-goods sectors.
Prices of leisure services, for example, rose by 8.4 per cent in the year to
May, while fares and other travel costs rose by 5.9 per cent. This compares
with an annual increase of 3 per cent for household goods and 2.5 per cent
for leisure goods.
The CSO said the rise in the index from 138.8 to 139.3 between April and May
mainly reflected higher motoring costs and some increases in food prices,
along with the remaining Budget increases in excise duties.
Overall food prices rose by 0.5 per cent on the month but seasonal food
prices dropped 1.2 per cent on the month.
This reflected the plentiful supplies of home-grown vegetables and, in
particular, lower prices for tomatoes, cucumbers and cauliflowers.
Apples, grapes and strawberries were cheaper and the price of home-killed
lamb, which usually rises in May, fell.
Seasonal food was the only sector of the index to fall last month but prices
for household services and clothing and footwear were static.
Although prices for men's clothing were higher, the CSO said there were
reductions on most items of women's clothes. Compared with a year ago,
clothing and footwear prices were only 0.2 per cent higher.
The monthly rise in housing costs of 0.2 per cent reflected the continuing
increase in the average size of outstanding mortgage debts, said the CSO.
Mrs Margaret Beckett, shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, said: 'In the
depths of recession, (May's inflation) figure must be regarded as very
disappointing, especially as it is many months since the prime minister said
that he had inflation 'licked'.'

FT  13 JUN 92 / Civil service union votes against strike
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GOVERNMENT PLANS for a shake-up in civil service pay received a boost
yesterday as members of the 114,000-strong National Union of Civil and
Public Servants voted not to strike against them.
The six-to-four vote significantly reduces the chances that any union will
take action against proposals to extend performance pay, devolve pay
determination to departments and agencies and keep this year's increases to
around the rate of inflation.
The 125,000 members of the Civil and Public Services Association have
already voted to accept a deal similar to that offered to the NUCPS.
The NUCPS vote, details of which were being withheld by the union's
leadership last night, was in spite of the union's conference last month
recommending a strike.
Conference delegates and many of the union's leadership are opposed to the
devolution of pay settlements to departments and to the extension of
performance-related pay.
They are also angry about the level of the offer, which will lead to basic
pay rises of 4.1 per cent from April 1 and, taking performance pay awards
into account, will add 4.5 per cent to the salary bill.
Members of the NUCPS may be given a further vote on whether they think the
union should sign an agreement with the Treasury.

FT  13 JUN 92 / Stress helpline is launched

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WORKERS suffering from stress are to be offered instant help on where to
find Tai-Chi exercise sessions or even juggling classes to help them relax,
following the launch yesterday of a one-stop anti-stress service for
companies.
The service by Mind, the mental health charity, will tackle more serious
emotional problems with a 24-hours-a-day counselling service. Stress
management courses will also be provided by the charity. Mind expects more
than 1,000 organisations to join the Pounds 600-a-year programme.
Companies will get extra peace of mind from the fact that the covenanted fee
to Mind will count as a charitable donation and can therefore be offset
against tax.
Stress and other emotional difficulties are estimated to cost Pounds 7bn a
year - at least half of which is calculated to be a direct cost to industry
through reductions in productivity. A total of 80m annual working days are
lost, according to Department of Health figures.

FT  13 JUN 92 / Proposed BCCI deal wins High Court approval
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE High Court yesterday agreed to sanction a Dollars 1.7bn (Pounds 921m)
compensation settlement negotiated with the Abu Dhabi majority shareholders
of Bank of Credit and Commerce International.
The judgment means Touche Ross, the provisional liquidator, has overcome the
first hurdle in its attempt to win court approval for the deal that will
give creditors between 30 per cent and 40 per cent of their original
investments.
The English Creditors Committee of BCCI, which had asked for the deal to be
rejected, was given until next Wednesday to lodge an appeal.
Sir Donald Nicholls, the vice-chancellor, giving judgment after a four-day
hearing, said the proposals represented the best option for the bank's
140,000 creditors in 70 countries around the world.
The judge accepted the liquidator's argument that rejection of the deal
would have been a 'huge gamble', leading to protracted litigation against
Abu Dhabi with no certainty about the outcome.
Sir Donald said that while he accepted that depositors felt the offer was
nowhere near enough, he thought that in the 'cold light of day' many would
realise that the prudent and sensible decision would be to accept what was
on offer now.
Many depositors, he said, had placed their confidence in him to 'wave a wand
and all will be well' but he said: 'I cannot conjure money out of the air,
however deserving the case. Nor can the liquidators. All I can do is choose
between the available options. I don't believe that if I rejected these
proposals I would be doing the depositors a service.'
One point clarified during the hearings is that the liquidators now have to
seek the approval of creditors representing 51 per cent of the identified
liabilities rather than 70 per cent as they suggested earlier. The original
agreement allowed Abu Dhabi to waive the condition.
Even if no appeal is lodged, two further court hearings are necessary before
the liquidators have final approval. If judgments in the Caymans next week
or in Luxembourg the following week go against the package the deal could
still fall.
Mr Tony Scott, secretary of the BCCI Depositors' Protection Association,
said he was confident there would be an appeal. He said: 'I believe that the
liquidators are using creditors' money to conclude a settlement that
creditors themselves do not want. I believe that is unfair and unjust.'
Lord Justice Bingham's report into the role of BCCI's supervisors in the UK
is expected to be published towards the end of next month.

FT  13 JUN 92 / Japanese business confidence slumps
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVEN BUTLER

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
HOPES FOR an early recovery of the Japanese economy were dashed yesterday
when the Bank of Japan reported that business confidence in May had plunged
to the lowest level in five years.
The results of the quarterly Tankan, or short-term economic survey, showed
an unexpectedly pessimistic outlook and contributed to a decline yesterday
on the Tokyo Stock Exchange. The Nikkei Average closed down 325.37 points at
17,383,68.
The closely-watched index of business conditions for manufacturing
industries plunged from minus 5 per cent in February to minus 24 per cent,
compared to a forecast in February of minus 12 per cent. Non-manufacturing
fell from 17 per cent in February to 1 per cent in May, compared to a
forecast of 5 per cent.
The Bank of Japan nonetheless said the economy had hit bottom and
manufacturers were expecting a modest improvement in the months ahead, with
the index rising to minus 20 per cent in September.
Manufacturing profits are expected to be down by 4.8 per cent in fiscal
1992, which began in April, after falling 23.4 per cent in 1991. Profits in
the first half of the year are projected to be off 22.5 per cent, although
the second half of the year will see a 17 per cent rise compared to the same
period of 1991.
The survey confirmed earlier statistics indicating that the overhang of
unsold goods which has depressed the manufacturing sector has not eased. The
index of product inventory levels rose from 31 per cent in February to 32
per cent in May, compared to earlier forecasts of a decline to 18 per cent.
The Bank of Japan said the survey would not cause it to ease monetary policy
further. The official discount rate, at which the central banks lends money
to commercial banks, was last reduced by 0.75 per cent to 3.75 per cent in
early April. Economists believe the central bank may be forced to reduce
interest rates again in the autumn.
The Tankan survey showed a continuing modest easing in conditions in the
labour market with the index moving from minus 15 per cent in February to
minus 7 per cent in May.

FT  13 JUN 92 / World Bank tells India to reduce budget deficit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID HOUSEGO
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   DELHI
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
INDIA has been warned by the World Bank that any delay in reducing the
budget deficit or in implementing structural reforms would erode the
credibility of its economic readjustment programme.
The Bank, in its report before the annual gathering in Paris of western
donor countries at the end of the month, says that a rapid reduction in
inflation and strong export growth are 'critical' to the short-term
prospects of the programme.
It adds that if the Indian government can maintain the pace of reform, India
could become 'one of the most dynamic economies' in the latter half of the
1990s and beyond.
The report comes, however, at a time when the government's ability to take
fresh policy initiatives has been badly affected by the Bombay financial
scandal. An opposition leader has alleged that four ministers in prime
minister Narasimha Rao's administration are involved. The possible political
fall-out from the scandal is already putting the government on the defensive
and impairing its ability to take unpopular decisions.
The other factor that could throw out of joint the government's
macroeconomic calculations is a growing prospect of a failure of the monsoon
this year. Diplomats with access to international data say that there are
grim omens after four years of good monsoons. A worsening of the drought
that has already hit parts of western India would further push up prices and
imports.
The Bank says India needs a further Dollars 3bn (Pounds 1.0bn) in
exceptional balance of payments financing this year following the Dollars
3.7bn provided last year. India will be asking the aid donor consortium
meeting in Paris for an additional Dollars 600m beyond the Dollars 2.4bn
being provided by the World Bank and the IMF.
The Bank says in its report, which was leaked to a government-owned news
agency, that the government had achieved 'impressive' progress in reducing
deficits and initiating structural changes. It calls for continuing budget
austerity, a reduction in subsidies, a containing of the government wage
bill and a broadening of the direct tax base.
It says the balance of payments situation is still 'fragile' and the present
foreign exchange reserves of Dollars 5.5bn is insufficient to cope with
shocks such as a decline in agricultural output or adverse developments
externally.

FT  13 JUN 92 / Solicitors' appeal against SIB action fails
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND HUGHES, Law Courts Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A RENEWED attempt to stop the Securities and Investments Board suing London
solicitors alleged to have been involved in unlawful share-pushing in the UK
by an offshore company has failed.
The Court of Appeal yesterday upheld the High Court's refusal to strike out
SIB's action seeking restitution from Shoosmith &amp; Morrison and two members
of the firm.
SIB alleges the solicitors were 'knowingly concerned' in the share-pushing
operations of Pantell, a Swiss company that carried on un-authorised
investment business in the UK in 1988-89 in breach of the Financial Services
Act.
As a result of Pantell's operations, UK investors bought 1.4m valueless
shares in European American Corporation, Euramco, for more than Dollars 2m.
Individual investors have no right to sue third parties 'knowingly
concerned' in contraventions of the act. The solicitors deny the allegation.
Lord Justice Steyn said the investor protection provisions in the act had
been prompted by the widespread belief that the operations of share-pushers
damaged the market's integrity and were contrary to the public interest.
He said share-pushers were often beyond the reach of English law, but it was
clear that their operations were often made possible only because of the
assistance of third parties, such as bankers, accountants and solicitors.
Lord Justice Scott said Pantell's misleading advertisements, and its
salesmen making unsolicited phone calls, had tried to persuade people to buy
shares in Euramco, a company incorporated in Utah in the US.
SIB alleged that the solicitors had acted for Pantell and for Swiss Atlantic
Holdings, which authorised Pantell to sell Euramco shares in the UK on a
commission basis.
Lord Justice Scott said the act provided for restitution orders designed to
restore the parties to the transactions to their former positions.
Restitution, the repayment of an investor's money in return for the shares
being returned to the vendor, could be ordered against the share-pusher and
'any other person . . . knowingly concerned' in breach of the act.
Lord Justice Scott dismissed the objection to SIB's claim that the
solicitors had not received any of the money paid by investors that it was
proposed they should be ordered to repay.

FT  13 JUN 92 / UK bank starts criminal action to recoup Bombay losses

<TEXT>
STANDARD CHARTERED, the UK-based international bank, yesterday said it was
launching criminal proceedings in India to try to recover Rs9.04bn (Pounds
162m) from brokers and others it believes defrauded it through the
securities market there.
Among those implicated in the criminal action is expected to be one of
India's most influential financiers, Mr Bhupen Dalal, along with brokers
connected to Mr Dalal and his broking firm, Bhupen Champaklal Devidas.
The amount sought by Standard is higher than the total potential exposure of
Pounds 100m it has admitted before. However, it holds securities which it
believes cover its claims on Bank of Karad, a tiny Indian bank which owes it
some Pounds 65m and which is in the process of being wound up. The Reserve
Bank of India, the country's central bank, had put its total exposure at
some Pounds 200m.
Standard Chartered announced its action following a meeting in London on
Thursday between Mr Rodney Galpin and Mr Malcolm Williamson, its chairman
and chief executive, and Mr S. Venkitaramanan, governor of the Reserve Bank.
The Reserve Bank said that, from what it had so far seen, it was satisfied
that Standard Chartered's Pounds 50m provision against possible losses was
adequate.
In a separate move to shore up the liquidity of its Indian operations,
Standard Chartered said it had transferred funds into the country.
Standard Chartered had earlier been in negotiation with Mr Dalal and others
to try to reach a settlement over the affair. However, it is believed to
have come under pressure from the Reserve Bank to launch criminal actions in
conjunction with India's Central Bureau of Investigation.
Mr Dalal will be the second prominent Indian financier implicated in the
affair, following the arrest last week of Mr Harshad Mehta, a broker. Unlike
Mr Mehta - who achieved instant cult status last year for his bold
investments - Mr Dalal has spent two decades building up a reputation as one
of the country's most discrete and influential financiers.
Those likely to be implicated in the criminal proceedings include Mr Hiten
Dalal, a distant cousin of Mr Bhupen Dalal, and Mr A D Narottam, a former
senior executive in Mr Bhupen Dalal's broking firm. Both were identified in
a report into the affair by the Reserve Bank ten days ago, and have since
had their assets seized by a government-appointed custodian. The action is
also likely to take in Mr J P Gandhi, said to be an uncle of Mr Bhupen Dalal
and head of his firm's government securities dealing.
Last night the CBI raided the home and office in Bombay of Mr V B Desai, a
broker linked to the Bank of Karad, and two offices of Union Commercial
Bank, which has also been linked to the scandals.
Mr Bhupen Dalal is well-known to Indian expatriate investors, having been
instrumental in persuading the authorities to develop special investment
accounts for non-resident Indians. Last month he travelled to London to
promote India's biggest share sale, a Rs12.5bn issue for the Mangalore oil
refinery.
Among his clients are members of the Birla family, one of India's leading
business clans, whose companies include Grasim and the IndoGulf group. Mr
Dalal has expanded out of broking in the past decade, establishing in Cifco
one of the small number of financial services groups which have been set up
to take advantage of the liberalisation of India's financial markets. State
Bank of India, the country's biggest commercial bank, is to make a provision
of Rs7.07bn against possible losses from the scandal.
The decision was taken at a special board meeting on Thursday evening,
called after the Reserve Bank had put pressure on it to set up the
provision.
The decision could weaken the position of ANZ Grindlays, which has so far
resisted calls from the Reserve Bank for it to provide against a possible
liability of Rs4bn. Both State Bank and Grindlays paid cheques made out in
their own names into accounts they maintained for Mr Harshad Mehta.

US consumer prices rose by a modest 0.1 per cent in May, cutting the
year-on-year inflation rate to 3.0 per cent, reports George Graham in
Washington. The Bureau of Labor Statistics said food prices fell by 0.4 per
cent during May, offsetting a 0.6 per cent increase in energy prices. The
core year-on-year inflation rate, excluding food and energy, dipped slightly
to 3.8 per cent.

FT  13 JUN 92 / Cancelled Domingo concert sparks litigation at Lloyd's
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A CANCELLED gala concert in Moscow featuring opera singer Placido Domingo
has sparked new litigation at the beleaguered Lloyd's of London insurance
market.
Mr Ricardo Cerdan, a Zurich-based music promoter, has taken legal action
after a Lloyd's underwriter, Mr Victor Broad, refused to pay SFr3m (Pounds
1.1m) on a contingency insurance policy taken out to cover losses due to
forced cancellation of the event.
Other insurers in a policy led by Mr Broad's syndicate include the
Paris-based SCOR, Italy's Generali and 13 other Lloyd's syndicates.
A writ was served last month by London-based solicitors Paisner on behalf of
Mr Cerdan's company, International Cultural Sponsorship Corporation.
ICSC initially signed a contract with Mr Domingo in January last year to
perform a New Year's eve concert in the Russian capital.
Subsequently Mr Cerdan made an agreement with leading TV companies and Sony,
the Japanese electronics company, to broadcast and record the event.
But last winter, as economic conditions worsened in the former Soviet Union,
the event was dogged by a series of un-expected logistical difficulties such
as fuel shortages. A fortnight before the event, ICSC was forced to cancel.
An insurance policy providing for comprehensive coverage against
cancellation had been bought in June - but insurers, led by Mr Broad's
syndicate 370, have denied liability and are refusing to pay.
Banks and TV companies supporting the event have written to Mr David
Coleridge, chairman of Lloyd's, suggesting that the market's reputation
could be further tarnished by the affair.
Geneva-based Banque Scandinave en Suisse said: 'We simply cannot understand
why this claim has not yet been settled.'
Mr Broad said that the affair was a 'legitimate claims problem' and that the
syndicate had denied the claim after Gaebel Watkins and Taylor, the
independent loss adjusters, had expressed reservations.
'If there is something in the claim which wasn't satisfactory we have to
protect our Names,' Mr Broad added.

FT  13 JUN 92 / EC shift working plans opposed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH employers fear a massive disruption to shift systems if the
government accepts the European Community's working time directive at the
next meeting of employment ministers on June 24.
The Engineering Employers' Federation and the British Printing Industries
Federation believe the government has concentrated too much opposition to
the directive on the issue of the 48-hour maximum working week and has
virtually ignored restrictions on shift systems which could have much more
damaging effects.
Mr Peter Reid, head of employment policy at the Engineering Employers'
Federation, said the proposed restrictions on shift work were 'much more
important' than the 48-hour limitation and could cause havoc in
continuous-process industries.
The restrictions that worry both federations include an eight-hour limit on
night shifts, an 11-hour minimum daily rest period, and 35 hours'
consecutive rest at least once a week. Foundries, forges, plastics, plating
and many other processes could be hit, the employers say, and argue that
many night-shift employees prefer a pattern of four 10-hour shifts to five
of eight hours.
These details have been largely disregarded as the government has fought the
ban on Sunday working - now won - and the 48-hour week.
A Portuguese compromise to allow working weeks of more than 48 hours if
employees agree, at least for an initial 10-year period, could provide the
basis for a deal at the meeting on the directive.
An agreement is also expected on the UK proposal to allow negotiations
between the 'social partners' at the most appropriate level and not at
national level. The Low Pay Unit has attacked the idea of allowing workers
to volunteer for working weeks of more than 48 hours. It says that British
employment law is not strong enough to prevent people being forced to work
the longer hours.
The unit adds that 12 per cent of male manual workers presently work for
more than 48 hours a week.

FT  13 JUN 92 / US-Russia arms cut talks make progress
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WHITE, Defence Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE US and Russia last night reported progress towards further deep cuts in
their long-range nuclear arsenals, but left it unclear whether an agreement
would be possible at next week's summit meeting in Washington.
Mr James Baker, the US secretary of state, and Mr Andrei Kozyrev, the Soviet
foreign minister, who met in London yesterday, both said there was 'a good
chance' of an accord.
But Mr Baker added: 'We are not there yet, and there are still problems that
have to be decided.'
The two ministers reported back last night to President George Bush and
President Boris Yeltsin, who are due to start their summit on Tuesday.
Mr Baker said there had been movement by both sides towards an agreement
that would lead to deep reductions, including some in the most destabilising
weapons. By this he meant land-based intercontinental missiles with multiple
warheads, which the US sees as being the most likely to be used early in a
conflict and has proposed eliminating altogether.
Russia, however, has argued that would unfairly favour the US. These
missiles make up the bulk of Russia's long-range nuclear weapons but only a
quarter of the US arsenal.
On the other hand, proposals made by Mr Bush in January included a reduction
of only one third in the number of warheads on US submarine-launched
ballistic missiles, weapons, in which the US has an overwhelming advantage.
The Russians have indicated, however, that they will accept the US target of
reducing to about 4,700 strategic warheads each, about half the current
level. The cuts would go much further than the Start treaty signed by the
two leaders last July, but not as far as the original Soviet proposal of
about 2,500 warheads.
Mr Baker said a summit agreement on 'broad parameters' would be better than
no agreement at all. Neither would give any details on the state of the
talks. 'The rest will depend on our presidents,' Mr Kozyrev said.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UNILEVER, the Anglo-Dutch consumer products group, and Mars, the US-owned
food manufacturer, both claimed victory yesterday in the latest round of
their legal battle over the European ice cream market.
The European Court of Justice confirmed an earlier decision lifting a
European Commission order which suspended until the end of the year
exclusive sales agreements between German retailers, Unilever and Scholler
Lebensmittel, another ice cream maker.
However, the court also ruled that Mars could place ice cream freezers in
18,000 German petrol stations, regardless of any agreements tying the
stations to Langnese-Iglo, Unilever's German ice cream subsidiary, and
Scholler. Unilever said this concession had already been offered, and
rejected by Mars.
As well as contesting the agreements, Mars has complained to Brussels that
the two other companies' exclusive control of freezer cabinets restricted
competition.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Gianni Prandini, the outgoing Christian Democrat minister of public
works, has been served notice by Rome magistrates that he is being
investigated for alleged abuse of public office over road contracts in
Calabria.
He is the second minister in the outgoing Andreotti government to be put
under investigation for corruption. Mr Carlo Tognoli, the socialist minister
of tourism, was served notice by magistrates seven weeks ago as part of the
Milan municipal corruption scandal.
Mr Prandini's case is unrelated to the three-month-old Milan scandal, but it
comes at a time of unprecedented public pressure to clean up public life. In
Milan, over 40 prominent businessmen and politicians are accused of
involvement in a sophisticated network of rigged contracts and political
party pay-offs.
The money was allegedly used for illegal funding of the parties represented
on the municipal administration and split according to their percentage of
the vote.
Seven members of parliament are being investigated over the affair. The
latest is Mr Luigi Baruffi, a national organisers of the Christian Democrat
party and linked to Mr Giulio Andreotti, the premier.
The Italian Finance Ministry said it would ban the sale, distribution and
import of BAT Industries Kent cigarettes in Italy for 30 days from today
under anti-smuggling legislation, Reuter reports. The law, passed last year,
automatically bans any brand if more than five tonnes of contraband are
discovered.

   BELGRADE, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Radovan Karadzic, whose Serb irregulars have bombarded and besieged the
Bosnian capital of Sarajevo for more than two months, yesterday announced a
unilateral ceasefire starting on Monday.
The statement made by Mr Karadzic in Belgrade, the Serbian capital, was
cautiously welcomed by United Nations officials and the European Community,
which said it would resume the peace talks in Bosnia once the UN gained
control of Sarajevo airport.
Lord Carrington, chairman of the EC-sponsored peace conference on
Yugoslavia, yesterday said he and Mr Jose Cutileiro, the EC negotiator,
would travel to Sarajevo in a new effort to restart the talks about 'the
future constitutional arrangements of Bosnia-Hercegovina'.
Placing Sarajevo airport under UN control could pave the way for sending
relief supplies into the city, whose 300,000 inhabitants are on the verge of
starvation.
However, UN officials said it would be difficult to demilitarise the areas
around the airport held by Serb irregulars.
Despite the ceasefire announcement, western diplomats yesterday said the
Serb irregulars might use it as a pretext for bombarding the city over the
next 72 hours.
In Sarajevo, heavy shelling and gunbattles were reported throughout the
city, killing at least 12 people. Croatian forces, organised by Croatia,
were continuing to burn Serb villages in Hercegovina, in the west of the
republic.
Meanwhile in Belgrade, intimidation of the foreign press, coupled with an
increasing climate of lawlessness, is increasing since the UN sanctions were
imposed two weeks ago. Yesterday, Ms Dessa Trevisan, The Times
correspondent, was shot while walking from her home to the state-run
international press centre.
Although she was not seriously injured, Ms Trevisan and other foreign
correspondents have received numerous death threats and have had their car
tyres slashed. A Kuwaiti journalist had a tear gas canister thrown into his
home earlier this week.
US secretary of state James Baker said yesterday the US was stepping up the
provision of intelligence information to assist UN peace-keeping troops in
Bosnia and would consider an airlift of relief aid, Reuter reports from
London.

FT  13 JUN 92 / Madrid may have to raise taxes as deficits grow
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER BRUCE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Spanish government, alarmed at the rapid growth of its budget and
current account deficits, has warned it may be forced to raise withholding
taxes on incomes just a few months after lowering them.
The warnings coincided with the publication yesterday of May inflation
figures showing a 0.3 per cent rise in the consumer price index, which held
year-on-year inflation to 6.5 per cent for the second month in a row.
Although the May figures confirm a slowing in price rises, the government
had been hoping for an even lower increase.
The Madrid stock market lost ground on the news and the Treasury's 10-year
bond, already battered by panic selling following the Danish referendum on
June 2, fell again. The bond has shed 4.2 per cent since the referendum and
was yielding 11.6 per cent yesterday, sharply up from 10.8 per cent the day
before the Danish vote.
The falls in the price of the Spanish long bond, analysts fear, may force
the government to resort, once again, to issuing short term T-bills to
finance its budget deficit, which by the end of April totalled Pta655bn
(Pounds 3.6bn), up 53 per cent on the same time last year.
This has raised serious doubts about plans to cut the country's public
deficit from 4.4 per cent of GDP last year to 1 per cent in 1997 as part of
its plans to streamline the economy ahead of European monetary union.
A deteriorating trade picture is also undermining the current account of the
balance of payments, which was in deficit by Pta554bn in the first quarter
of this year, an increase of more than 20 per cent on 1991.
The government now admits it will not achieve its economic growth target of
3 per cent this year and many economists doubt it will be able to make 2.5
per cent.
In the interbank market, interest rates have begun to stiffen. Analysts say,
however, that while the government is desperate not to raise official
interest rates, its difficulties make entry into the narrow band of the EMS
exchange rate mechanism highly unlikely this year.
With the deficits widening and tax revenues falling, Mr Carlos Solchaga,
finance minister, has said he would have little option but to increase tax
withheld on salaries.
This, he says, would bolster the government's coffers in the short term and
take money out of circulation.
The move, if implemented, would be unpopular and contradicts the spirit of
government promises not to increase taxes as part of the convergence process
with the EC.
It could make it more difficult for the authorities to maintain public
support against union demands that it restore unemployment benefit cuts
decreed two months ago, also as part of its convergence plans.
The unions mounted an unsuccessful general strike in protest at the cuts
late last month and are planning another for October.

FT  13 JUN 92 / Ministers laud co-operation in EC: Lisbon meeting on
immigration and crime seen as a success
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL

<DATELINE>
   LISBON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EC interior ministers yesterday praised the efficiency of direct
co-operation between member states, delivering a veiled criticism of the
bureaucratic and legalistic processes of the European Commission and Court
of Justice.
Mr Kenneth Clarke, the British home secretary, said that in the light of the
Danish vote against the Maastricht treaty last week, he had been 'very
encouraged' by the atmosphere of the two-day meeting in Lisbon, which
discussed co-operation on immigration policy and crime-fighting.
'No one sought to impose solutions on an unwilling government, nobody placed
too much emphasis on bureaucracy, everybody concentrated on the principal
objectives which make this work so important,' he said after the meeting had
ended.
Mr Hirsch Ballin, the Dutch justice minister, said he thought there was 'a
common feeling among the 12 that we should intensify our co-operation' in
the area of immigration and judicial policy.
They form one of two 'pillars' of the Maastricht agreement - the other being
foreign and defence policy - in which the influence of the Commission and
Court of Justice would be limited or non-existent.
Some form of inter-governmental co-operation in these areas would almost
certainly survive, even if the Maastricht agreement collapsed. Mr Clarke
said: 'I believe this third pillar of Maastricht is going to be a success.'
During yesterday's meeting, ministers agreed that a German-led project team
should be set up in Strasbourg with a view to establishing 'Europol' - a
European police organisation - by the end of the year.
EC leaders will be asked to decide on the location of Europol's headquarters
at the Lisbon summit in two weeks' time.
The summit may also have to resolve the question of Gibraltar's treatment in
the long-awaited convention on strengthening the EC's external frontiers,
which is being held up by the UK-Spanish dispute over the colony.

FT  13 JUN 92 / Transatlantic air-fare 'war' is only a light scuffle: Delta
Air Lines' price cuts on former Pan Am routes are seen as a publicity feat
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NO SOONER had the US domestic 'air wars' abated, than Delta Air Lines - one
of the nation's three 'mega-carriers' - announced last week that it was
cutting prices on its transatlantic routes. International travellers hoped
that they too would enjoy the sort of ticket bargains which have sent US
holiday-makers into such frenzied excitement in the past six weeks.
No such luck. The Delta cuts duly generated a string of matching deals from
other US carriers and from European airlines, including Lufthansa, Swissair
and British Airways. But the reductions were never that generous in the
first place, nor were they aimed at the leisure traveller.
The drawbacks to Delta's initiative are threefold. For a start, although the
new fares are billed as 'up to 45 per cent' lower, maximum reductions can
only be found on the least popular routes.
If you want to fly between Miami and Istanbul, you may find some fares have
almost halved. But between Los Angeles and London, Delta's cuts range from 1
to 28 per cent (depending on the type of fare). Between Atlanta and London,
the savings are 12 to 20 per cent. And so on.
Second, these cheaper fares apply solely to round-trip travel originating in
the US. Anyone who wants to board the outward-bound aircraft in the UK or
Continental Europe - or simply wants a one-way ticket - will find them of no
use at all.
Third, the fare reductions apply only to full coach, business class and
first class tickets, and do not permit stopovers of more than 14 days. That
provides little appeal for the average leisure traveller, although the new
fares may benefit the business market.
Today, according to one New York 'bucket shop', a round-trip ticket between
Los Angeles and London, for travel in early August, would cost about Dollars
800 (Pounds 440). By contrast, Delta's full coach fare, which has come down
by a princely 1 per cent, is Dollars 1,800.
To get a more significant 28 per cent fare reduction on the LA to London
route, you would need to buy a first class ticket - now Dollars 5,800, down
from Dollars 8,100.
The business community may be more grateful. 'I've got one customer who was
going from New York to Milan anyway - and his fare's come down from Dollars
3,400 to about Dollars 2,800,' said one US travel agent after the cuts took
effect.
Even so, the truly thrifty businessman will still find that Trans World
Airlines, the bankrupt carrier owned by Carl Icahn, undercuts Delta and its
imitators - although the differential has been reduced to the cost of a
modest lunch.
Many observers view Delta's initiative more as a publicity feat, than a
serious bout of 'fare wars'. After all, the Atlanta-based carrier acquired
its extensive Transatlantic routes from the now-defunct Pan Am only last
November. Given subsequent integration problems, this may be a good
opportunity to tell the world what Delta now offers.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TELEKOM, the lumbering telecommunications arm of the giant Deutsche
Bundespost, is patting itself on the head this month after re-uniting the
severed telephone systems of east and west Berlin.
It is also in the process of installing 112,000 new phones in east Berlin by
the end of this year. Some easterners had waited for 30 years and more for a
telephone. Small wonder that the former East Germany's fossilised Deutsche
Post was relegated to the scrap heap last year.
However, my own urgent request to Telekom for two telephones to be installed
in the east Berlin office-to-be of the Financial Times was nearly five
months old when I aborted it this month.
It began optimistically enough. The pleasant Telekom lady in charge of the
press department in west Berlin said the telephones would be connected to
the most up-to-date new digital exchange in east Berlin, she promised.
With visions of care-free dialling I filled out the required form in
triplicate on January 17. As of last week the copy of the form still lay on
my desk, yellowed and brittle. But no telephones.
Throughout the winter months I was blithely assured that my requests were
continuing to receive priority attention. My calls to responsible officials
resembled communications into a black void. Phones rang unanswered, only to
be engaged moments later and then unanswered again for hours.
By March it was clear that something was seriously amiss when a Telekom
underling called to request information I had given months earlier.
A note of irritation entered the voice of the press department lady when I
suggested that we were paying a lot of money to rent an office which still
had no telephones. My punishment was to be quickly transferred to another
colleague who began by requesting the relevant information from scratch.
It was after a holiday in May that I found the first written advice from
Telekom, a form letter saying that 'unfortunately your urgently requested
telephone cannot be immediately installed'.
The following day I was nearly floored when I opened the door to the
still-empty east Berlin office after an absence of weeks. Perched on the
window sills were brand-new telephones in both rooms. I marvelled at the
steady dial-tone and incoherent with excitement called my home.
I rushed downstairs to speak to the manager of the building. Yes, she
explained, the phones were installed several weeks after she had applied for
them last January. What accounted for Telekom's remarkably swift
installation? I asked,
With a knowing smile she said she had personally handed in her application
to a long-time acquaintance from the old Deutsche Post who was now happily
at work for Telekom.

MR Martin Bangemann, the European Commission vice-president with
responsibility for the internal market and industrial affairs, yesterday
proposed that amendments to the Treaty of Rome should be approved by a
qualified majority of EC member states rather than by a unanimous vote,
writes Paul Betts from Berlin.
He told a Financial Times conference in Berlin that it would be undemocratic
to give up the Maastricht treaty just because of a rejection by one member
state.
The EC would be in an impossible position if it was eventually enlarged to
incorporate 24 states and yet only one of these could block any widely
agreed amendment.
He proposed the introduction of a rule to enable approval of Treaty of Rome
amendments by a qualified majority of two-thirds of member states.
Meanwhile, he said, the Maastricht ratification process should continue.

FT  13 JUN 92 / Banks did not discuss their Maxwell fears
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON and BRONWEN MADDOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ABOUT 20 banks became con-cerned last summer at the behaviour of businesses
run by Robert Maxwell several months before he died and his business empire
collapsed.
Their concern arose when Maxwell Communication Corporation made late
payments to them, a Financial Times investigation has discovered.
Yet although some banks became alarmed at the implications for the financial
health of his empire, they did not discuss their concerns with each other or
with authorities such as the Bank of England.
Mr Basil Brookes, MCC's former finance director, has described his shock to
the FT at discovering last August that MCC had failed to settle foreign
currency transactions with about 20 banks on time.
Starting about July 4 1991, MCC's treasury, under the authority of Maxwell
and his son, Kevin, had begun to buy and sell enormous amounts of foreign
currencies. In these 'spot' transactions, MCC would buy a currency in one
financial centre promising to make payment in another centre. On a number of
occasions, MCC received the currency, but did not make the payment - thereby
giving itself an unauthorised loan.
Mr Brookes says about 20 banks, including Lloyds, Bank of America, Goldman
Sachs and Swiss Bank Corporation, were involved in the flurry of foreign
exchange deals. At least Dollars 100m (Pounds 55m) in unapproved credit is
thought to have been raised this way. A former Maxwell employee said some
appeared to have been channelled into private Maxwell businesses.
One banker said attempts to raise money by making late payments in the
foreign market was a relatively well-known ruse with the nickname called
'teaming and lading'.
It also emerged yesterday that National Westminster Bank, the biggest lender
to the Maxwell private companies, felt badly let down by Maxwell because he
failed to deliver funds on time at the end of July.
At a meeting between Maxwell and Mr John Melbourn, a NatWest director, on
July 10, NatWest refused Maxwell's request for a loan of Pounds 45m.
NatWest was upset three weeks later when it provided funds - less than
Pounds 100m - to the Maxwell empire on the understanding that it would be
repaid the same day, and then found that repayment was not made.
NatWest was forced to convert this 'intra-day' transaction into a short-term
loan, which was eventually repaid. The bank told both Robert Maxwell and Mr
Kevin Maxwell that it was concerned that repayment had not been made, but it
did not discuss the problem with other banks or with the Bank of England.
Instead, it pressed on with its policy of reducing the size of its loans to
the Maxwell businesses. NatWest's loans to the Maxwell empire now total
Pounds 182m, half the level of two years ago.
Later last year, Robert Maxwell made many repayments to banks by looting
pension fund assets and also carrying out unusual fundraising exercises with
US investment banks, from which tens of millions of dollars were borrowed at
a high price.

FT  13 JUN 92 / World leaders pledge backing for global clean-up: Heads of
state stop short of financial commitments at Earth Summit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
DOZENS OF world leaders pledged their political backing yesterday for a
global action plan to clean up the environment.
But they hung back from making the heavy financial commitments which the
Earth Summit organisers said were needed to make it work.
As 117 heads of state and government gathered in the vast Riocentro to
endorse a series of accords to put the world economy on a more sustainable
path, their ministers were engaged in hectic last-minute negotiations to
finalise agreements, including one to conserve the world's forests.
The two-day heads of state gathering, the largest of its kind, marks the end
of the two-week summit which was supposed to put the environment at the top
of the political agenda.
But all the accords which are due to be agreed fall short of their original
aims, although many political leaders stressed yesterday that Rio must mark
a beginning not an end.
The summit opened amid expectations that industrial countries would pledge
money to help the poor south improve its environment, an issue which
dominated the debate. But the rich countries made modest commitments, laying
most of their stress on non-financial initiatives.
The first leader of these countries to speak was Mr John Major, the UK prime
minister. He said he would support an enlargement of the Global Environment
Facility, (GEF), the fund administered jointly by the United Nations and the
World Bank to help the Third World, from its present level of Dollars 1.3bn
to between Dollars 2bn and Dollars 3bn (Pounds 1bn-Pounds 1.6bn).
This would imply an increase in the UK's contribution from Pounds 40m to
about Pounds 100m. However, the UK had already announced that it would
support an enlarged GEF. Although Mr Major said the UK would support other
new aid initiatives, he declined to put any figures on them because the UK's
next spending round had not been agreed.
Invoking the UK's strengths in scientific research, Mr Major also announced
a 'Darwin initiative' to support studies of world species and habitats.
He said the UK would also hold a Global Technology Partnership conference
early next year to improve access by developing countries to the UK's
environmental technology.
President George Bush defied the many critics of US environmental policy
with the boast: 'America's record on environmental protection is second to
none. So I did not come here to apologise.'
He said the US 'stands by' to raise its international environmental aid, but
officials said his speech marked no change from the previous US position. Mr
Bush offered to host a meeting of industrialised countries to plan a 'prompt
start' to the summit's treaty limiting greenhouse gases by next January.
Mr Helmut Kohl, the German chancellor, said Germany would support a GEF of
just over Dollars 4bn. But he pleaded the heavy cost of cleaning up east
Germany for not making more pledges of aid.
With the exception of a handful of smaller European countries, all the
industrial nations are resisting pressure from the Third World to pledge 0.7
per cent of their GNP to aid by the year 2000.
Mr Kohl only said Germany would do this 'as soon as possible' - the form of
words favoured by most industrial nations.
Mr Anibal Cavaco Silva, the president of Portugal, which holds the EC
presidency, said Community countries would give Dollars 4bn to finance
Agenda 21, the Earth Summit action plan extending into the next century.
However, EC officials were unable to say how much of this represented new
money.
The largest aid commitment is likely to come from Japan, whose turn to speak
comes today. Japanese officials have indicated that it may make a multi-year
pledge of Dollars 5bn-Dollars 10bn.
However, all these sums fall far short of the Dollars 125bn a year which the
summit's UN organisers have said the Third World needs.

FT  13 JUN 92 / Life peerage for Jeffrey Archer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BEST SELLING author and former Conservative MP Mr Jeffrey Archer becomes a
life peer in today's honours lists, in which political nominations for
working peerages coincide with the Queen's birthday honours.
Mr Andrew Lloyd Webber, who arranged the Tories' election campaign theme and
threatened to leave the UK if Labour won, is among the 33 knights on the
birthday honours list, for services to the arts.
Industrialists honoured include two from the 'beerage' - Mr Alick Rankin,
chairman of Scottish and Newcastle, and Mr Anthony Tennant, chairman of
Guinness.
Mr Alan Cockshaw, chairman of AMEC; Mr Desmond Pitcher, chief executive of
Littlewoods; Mr Colin Southgate, chairman of Thorn EMI; and Mr Roy Watts,
chairman of Thames Water, also become knights.
Mr Archer joins four Tory MPs who stood down at the last election on the
working peers list, together with four Labour nominees, including Mr John
Eatwell, economic adviser to Mr Neil Kinnock, and Professor Raymond Plant,
who chaired Labour's commission on electoral reform.
Mr Victor Cooke becomes the first Ulster Unionist working peer: the Liberal
Democrats were not offered a place on the list.
Working peers are nominated on the basis that they will attend the House of
Lords regularly to take part in the processing of legislation. Today's list
somewhat redresses the balance from last week's dissolution honours list, in
which most of those going to the Lords were former Tory cabinet ministers.
Among the political honours in the 943 awards on the birthday list, Mr Alan
Beith, the Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesman, becomes a privy counsellor,
while there is a life peerage for Sir Bernard Braine, until the election the
MP with the longest continuous service. The political knights include Mr
Ivan Lawrence MP, who narrowly missed being appointed to Mr John Major's
administration.
Dame Elisabeth Frink, the sculptor, becomes a companion of honour, and Mr
Anthony Kenny, president of the British Academy, becomes a knight. Mr Louis
Blom-Cooper QC, former chairman of the Press Council and author of the
Justinian column in the Financial Times, is also knighted.
Mr Ian Botham and Mr David Gower, two England cricketers, become OBEs, for
services to the sport, while Mr Clive Lloyd, the former West Indian captain,
is made a CBE for services to cricket and for public service in Lancashire.
Mr Michael Caine and Miss Prunella Scales become CBEs for services to
acting.
Women make up nearly a third of those honoured in the birthday list,
although the proportion falls to little more than a quarter if the lowest
class of award - the British Empire Medal - is excluded.

FT  13 JUN 92 / Fisons shares drop 29% on profits warning
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FISONS, the British pharmaceuticals and scientific equipment group,
yesterday surprised the City by warning that its interim profits were likely
to be less than half the Pounds 95.2m figure achieved in the first six
months of 1991.
The company's shares fell by 29 per cent, closing 100p lower at 245p, at
which the company is valued at Pounds 1.69bn.
Mr Patrick Egan, group chairman, said continuing difficulties in the
pharmaceuticals division were mainly to blame for the 'very disappointing'
first-half results. Turnover at the scientific instruments division would
also be lower than last year because of the recession.
City analysts, stung by the announcement, said it raised doubts about
Fisons' future. Most believe that the shares would have to fall further for
a takeover bid. Mr Egan has ruled out a merger with a larger group. He took
over in January when Mr John Kerridge retired as executive chairman after
pressure from institutional shareholders.
Fisons's pharmaceuticals operations have been troubled since 1989 when the
US Food and Drug Administration asked for Opticrom, an eye treatment, to be
withdrawn because of problems with quality standards. In 1990, Imferon, a
blood product, was withdrawn for similar reasons.
Before withdrawal, Opticrom had annual sales of about Dollars 40m.
Mr Cedric Scroggs, chief executive, said yesterday the loss of sales and
additional costs associated with upgrading Opticrom's manufacturing
facilities would significantly affect the results. In addition, the
attention paid to Opticrom and a desire not to market drugs with quality
deficiencies had meant sales of other products had suffered.
Analysts said Fisons told them yesterday it would make about Pounds 35m
during the first six months.
The pharmaceutical division would make operating profits of Pounds 17m for
the first half compared with Pounds 68m; the scientific equipment division
would make Pounds 18m (Pounds 27m); and horticultural products would make
Pounds 5m (Pounds 4.4m). Interest and other charges would amount to Pounds
5m.
The analysts said that such results would be dependent upon economic upturn.
The company's profit shortfall would not affect its planned disposal of the
horticultural and consumer health businesses, Mr Scroggs said. Fisons
remained financially strong and there was no need for fire-sales. The
businesses have been estimated to be worth between Pounds 300m and Pounds
400m.
The company's strategy of looking for co-marketing partners remained, Mr
Scroggs said. The company was particularly looking for a partner in the US.

FT  13 JUN 92 / Changing trams on the Maastricht road: Dominic Lawson is
determined to decide his own role in history
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DOMINIC LAWSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE WAS a young man who said 'damn]
It appears to me now that I am
Just a being which moves
In predestinate grooves
Not a bus, nor a train, but a tram.'
I believe that the author of this limerick gave it the title Determinism. It
is a profoundly depressing doctrine but one which has an attraction,
particularly to first-year philosophy students. In many cases they go on to
assert that since every cause has an effect it is possible to develop a
story which will anticipate and predict the movement of this ineluctable
tide in the affairs of men. This is sometimes called the march of history
or, by the Marxists, historicism.
In a way, it is a marvellously invigorating doctrine, like any faith. If you
know that capitalism is doomed, that it will be succeeded by socialism and
the dictatorship of the proletariat, and this in turn will be succeeded by
the heavenly state of perfect communism, then you have the tremendous power
of certainty and the confidence that only comes from knowing that you are on
the winning side.
That particular God has failed but there are others which have taken its
place. Those who argue for a federal Europe, and ultimately a European super
state, seem to me to have been similarly enthused and buoyed up by the idea
that they are somehow being carried along by the tide of history, but the
so-called 'Euro-sceptics' are in the same unfortunate position as King
Canute. (And King Canute at least endured his drenching to prove to his
courtiers that he was not omnipotent).
Since most people lack the certainty of political faith, they are much
swayed by those who have it. I had the impression, when socialism was the
height of fashion, that even Conservatives felt that they were on the losing
side of the history game and could only appease egalitarianism, not fight
it.
Similarly, even those Conservatives who had absolutely no faith in the
European ideal, let alone Euro-federalism, seemed cowed by the conviction of
the experts that this was indeed the march of history, that Jacques Delors
had a clearer understanding of the future role of Britain in Europe than the
woolly-minded Britons themselves.
To say that the tide of history has turned, as a result of the Danish
people's rejection of the Maastricht Treaty would be to make a similar
mistake to that of the Euro-historicists. History itself has no independent
tidal properties; there are only tides in men's opinions, which is nothing
more or less than intellectual fashion. For intellectual fashion, we must
await the judgment of the intellectuals, of the political avant garde. One
such is George Walden, who caused a great stir in the House of Commons last
week by telling his fellow Tory MP, John Major, that 'the Maastricht Treaty
was never wanted by this Government, this House or this country.'
As Simon Heffer pointed out in The Spectator, this was the same Tory MP who
wrote last November in an article entitled 'Why in the end there is no
choice at Maastricht' that: 'a policy of national conceit' had led some into
thinking that Britain could refuse to sign the Maastricht Treaty and that
those who did not want it were 'living in a world of their own fabrication,
which resembles nothing so much as a mist-shrouded castle besieged by an
army of Don Quixotes - they have taken leave of their senses'.
There is need of a new political parlour game. Just as psephologists like to
identify a constituency as so marginal that to know its result is to know
the way the country will move, so it should be possible to identify a Tory
MP whose intellect is so marginal, so uncertain and so finely balanced that
as it swings, so swings the Conservative Party. Various names spring to mind
but it would spoil the game to name all the candidates here and now. And
besides, I have a tram to catch.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IF I AM known in the office for anything, it is for my sang-froid. At times,
my imperturbability is mistaken for casualness, but it is a mistake that
detractors make only once.
It is because of my coolness and composure that editorial personages of a
surprising seniority frequently make the trek from the first floor to the
third to consult me in my bower, which is curtained off from the press of
humanity by a screen of exotic potted palms. Safe behind this screen, senior
editorial personages can pick my brains or seek my support in shadowy
enterprises.
But I boil over sometimes. Even my renowned calm can give way to dreadful
agitation if I am seriously provoked, and I have been provoked recently -
not by something in the office but by the UK government's wilful refusal to
countenance a referendum on the Maastricht treaty and the move to closer
European unity.
As I explained quite recently, I am a Euro-federalist. I want Europe to be
enlarged and homogenised: one queen, one president, one parliament, one
language, one rail system, and so on. Then I want us to move to world
government and integration, so as to help us counteract the unmitigated
vices, including genocide and environmental destructiveness, that help
distinguish us from the other two species of chimpanzee, and may prove our
downfall.
An ardent Euro-federalist I may be. But I am not a cheat or a hoodwinker. I
want us to integrate our affairs, in Europe and the world, not by subterfuge
but on the basis of intelligent majority approval as measured by referenda.
I want the politicians to lift their game mightily. To claim that the
Maastricht treaty or European unity were adequately discussed during the UK
election campaign two months ago is a lie. (This was the media's fault, as
much as the politicians'). To imagine that John Major, backed by a fragile
parliamentary majority, has the right to negotiate weighty constitutional
matters on our behalf is absurd.
First, I want a mass of information. I do not want to rely on Douglas Hurd's
tortured explanations of Maastricht, any more than I want to hear the
incoherent howls of the Euro-sceptics. I want facts, millions of them. I
want intelligent and unambiguous discussion, a genuine debate. Then I want a
referendum.
In fact, I want us to move towards electronic polling as swiftly as
possible. I want snap referenda on almost everything, for I see them as the
only way forward - the only way to smash the gridlock and end the bungling
that politicians almost everywhere have fallen into.
Next week I am launching the BBR, the British Board of Referenda. There is
much ground to cover. We will have referenda twice a week to start with;
eventually, daily. Here are some of the questions that we might have asked
this week, had we been in business. To illuminate my purpose and demonstrate
the sort of answers my referenda will generate, I am taking the liberty of
giving you the forecast result of each referendum question, as best as I can
calculate it:
1) Euro-federalism will mean one language, one parliament, one queen, one
anthem, one railway timetable, much cheaper cars and shorter working hours.
Are we in favour? (Result. For: 96.7 per cent. Against: 3.3 per cent).
2) The Brussels bureaucrats, led by Jacques Delors, are calling for an
outrageous increase in the EC budget, mainly so that they can donate great
sacks of cash to indolent smaller members like Spain, Portugal, Greece and
Ireland. Should we tell the bureaucrats to stop annoying us with such
proposals? (For: 97.8 per cent. Against: 2.2 per cent).
3) Do we all agree that the Prince and Princess of Wales have had a wretched
time at the hands of the media lately, and that about a dozen editors need
locking-up? (For: 99.1 per cent. Against: 0.9 per cent).
4) On the other hand, there is a widespread belief that Charles and Diana
would not be in this pickle if Charles wasn't such a cold fish. Should he be
told to lighten up? (For: 97.3 per cent. Against: 2.7 per cent).
5) Everyone hates the water companies. Shall we all hurl a saucepan of water
out of our windows at 8pm tonight? (For: 99.9 per cent. Against: 0.1 per
cent).
6) The England team at the European soccer finals in Sweden is arguing about
whether to play five men forward or five men back. Should we fax the manager
and tell him to play 10 men in the middle? (For: 94.9 per cent. Against: 5.1
per cent).

FT  13 JUN 92 / Private View: The little sister and the lost brother
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTIAN TYLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN HER retirement Margaret Ramsey is writing the life of her brother: not of
Michael, the bushy-browed Archbishop of Canterbury, but of Frank, the clever
one, who died at the age of 26.
Frank Ramsey was not merely clever. He was a mathematics prodigy whose work
in philosophy at Cambridge in the Twenties has raised him, in some eyes,
above Bertrand Russell and Ludwig Wittgenstein.
Ramsey was a physical giant (he stood 6ft 3ins. and weighed over 16 stone)
who threw open windows in mathematics, logic and economics. At the age of 18
he translated Wittgenstein's Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus and later he
supervised the irascible Austrian, 14 years his senior, for his PhD.
At the age of 21 he was helping the 52-year-old Russell to revise Principia
Mathematica. His paper on the theory of saving was described by Keynes as
'one of the most remarkable contributions to mathematical economics ever
made.' It was as if, said Keynes after the prodigy's death in 1930, Ramsey
had absorbed in the nursery everything then being discussed or written at
Trinity College.
For his sister, who was 12 when Frank died from jaundice, it has been a
painful yet liberating journey. It was not the first nor last tragedy in her
life: two years before, her mother had been killed when her father crashed
the car.
'I had almost a complete black-out for those two years,' she said this week.
'The first thing I remember after my mother's death was my sister appearing
on the doorstep of the boarding house where I was at school in Winchester in
floods of tears saying that Frank had died.
'These two deaths completely upset me. I couldn't accept them. I was just
full of hatred. I didn't feel any grief, just sort of fury and hatred.
'But then gradually I drifted - I was still a child - into a state of
feeling I had somehow to continue him. First of all, at school, I did it by
playing his records. He was very fond of music, particularly Beethoven
quartets.
'Then, I'd been going to read English at Newnham and suddenly at the last
minute I decided I'd do philosophy. I don't know why at all, but I'm quite
sure it had to do with Frank.
'So I read philosophy under very queer illusions about him. I wasn't a
conceited person about my brain. I was what you might call ordinary clever.
(She got a First, even so, went on to study economics and taught the subject
at Lady Margaret Hall, Oxford). But all the time I had this feeling that I
had to continue Frank's work. I knew it was a madness, but it gripped me
nevertheless. I remember saying 'Oh, well, if I get a First I'll be in the
same class as Frank and continuing him in some way.''
She continued him in another way, by marrying a clever philosopher called
George Paul. 'My husband was a continuation of Frank because he was by far
the cleverest young philosopher at Cambridge when I was there. He also sort
of inherited Frank's wit and kindness. He was very like him in many ways.'
They married in 1938 and had four girls: Helen, Elizabeth, Kathleen and
Anne. Then disaster struck again. While the girls were still in their teens,
their father died of a heart attack after a sailing accident on Lake
Coniston.
'We all suffered terribly and it took a very long time before any of them
could marry. And this was hard on all of us.'
Although fond of her brother Michael, she found him difficult. According to
his former press secretary, Michael De-La-Noy, the future Primate of All
England was a strange clumsy, messy and irritating youth with a habit of
suddenly jumping up and running round in circles.
He was generous to Margaret in her widowhood, sending her money to put a
daughter through Bedale's School. Yet he was distant. 'Michael couldn't bear
sisters, even as a young man. My sister and I were very sad about that. We
were quite fond of him but he simply couldn't relate to us.'
But with Frank she felt a real identity. They looked alike when young and
shared a sense of humour. So she worried about how to deal with her
brother's love life. 'It's like spying on someone you're fond of and
spilling the beans. Now that fear has gone. It's become what you might call
a technical problem.'
Though intellectually precocious, Frank was emotionally immature and very
dependent on their mother, Agnes. An infatuation with a married woman had
him going off to Vienna, as was fashionable then, to be psychoanalysed (and
talk to Wittgenstein).
Encouraged by his mother, he married Lettice Baker (later a well-known
photographer) when he was 22 but then fell in love with a friend of hers,
Elizabeth Denby. 'The mix-ups in his marriage made him very unhappy,' said
his sister. 'He was sort of tormented between the two of them for the rest
of his life. He couldn't give up either of them.'
Lettice had two daughters: Jane, a biochemist, who is still alive and Sarah
'an exceptionally gifted and happy person' who, like her father, died very
suddenly while an undergraduate at Newnham.
Margaret Ramsey has unearthed some of the proceedings of the secretive
Apostles, the small, exclusive discussion society to which the famous
Cambridge names belonged. Frank was a keen member, and did not miss a
meeting for over two years.
'It was his social life,' she said. 'He was not entirely easy with people
unless they were on the same wavelength as him.' But the records are
unhelpful: the subjects of discussion were concealed by jokey resolutions
voted on at the end. One such was 'Has Frank taughtoise?', another 'Should
Frank laugh again?'. (The Ramsey laugh was famous).
Frank's reputation has continued to grow and there has been speculation
about what he might have achieved had he lived. His sister finds the
adulation overdone and the speculation meaningless: 'You can't forecast what
original work someone might have done]'
A big admirer is Hugh Mellor, the present Professor of Philosophy at
Cambridge, who has described Ramsey as the most brilliant of his
contemporaries. Yet Prof. Mellor has strongly discouraged Margaret from
writing a biography. 'I don't know why. He sort of 'owns' Frank. I suspect
he feels he's the one who discovered this genius.'
I suggested she might be seen as the adoring little sister, unable to write
a critical life. Was she going to elevate Frank still further?
'No, not in the least. This interests me, this difficulty. Yes, he was a
very much loved person. He was thought to have a very good nature, to be a
very good man. I have to see through the obituaries in a way.'
If there were to be criticism what would it be?
'Ah. Well, he was very intolerant of people he thought fools. He didn't
understand people very well. He inherited a sort of kindness and warmth from
Mother, but he was constantly surprised about things in human nature. I'm
not suggesting he was unique in this. But if one's digging out defects, that
is one of them.
'Michael praised him to the skies in later years but Frank used to say
things like 'Michael became a clergyman because he was too stupid to do
anything else.''
After the death of her father - a mathematician who became President of
Magdalene College - Michael burned every letter in the house. 'Goodness
knows why. But I remember him now making a great bonfire at the end of the
garden.'
The father, Arthur, seems to have been an austere figure, a man of high
standards who worked obsessively, fearing he would die and leave his wife in
poverty. He did not believe a woman could be both feminine and successful.
'He used to refer to Biddy (her sister Bridget), who was perhaps a bit less
bright than the other three, as the fool of the family. She was very pretty
but she went through life hampered by feeling stupid. It was all nonsense:
she trained as a doctor.
'And I went through life having great difficulty in feeling pretty enough. I
found it very difficult to be feminine because Father felt that I wasn't'
Has this biography given you pain, or pleasure?
'Both. Large quantities of both.'
What are the painful bits?
'Mostly a feeling of inadequacy, that I can't make a good job of it. I have
left it rather late and my memory has got very poor.'
And the pleasurable aspects?
'When I get a bit right I feel frightfully pleased - and some of the
discoveries.'
Has it stirred up painful recollections?
'Yes, I've wept quite a few times reading old things, particularly the
deaths. His death can easily move me to tears now. But I don't, in a curious
way, count that as pain because it's worthwhile.'
It's more like mourning?
'Yes. After all, I didn't cry when he died because I was so resentful of him
dying and I was rather traumatised by my mother's death. So it's a sort of
relief. Yes, certainly.'
Has it helped you come to terms with the tragedies in your life?
'They become part of you. In a way you recover, but they do become part of
you. But yes, I think it has. I think I feel better in myself through doing
it.'
I thanked her for the interview.
'Well, I've enjoyed it actually. It's quite like writing the book. There's a
certain liberation in talking about oneself.'

FT  13 JUN 92 / The Long View: No recession here, thank you
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARRY RILEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THIS IS an uncomfortable time for the people who run Britain's privatised
utilities - the results season. The companies are making good profits, their
top executives are earning juicy bonuses; what a scandal, say the
newspapers, when the country is languishing in the depths of the recession.
Until British Telecom was floated in November 1984, there was no utility
sector to speak of in the London stock market. After 7 1/2 years -
comprising BT, British Gas, the water companies and the electricity industry
 -it represents some 10 1/2 per cent of the All-Share Index capitalisation.
It is bigger in stock market terms than banks, chemicals and construction
all put together.
Various political glosses were put on the privatisation programme, some of
them retrospective: once out of the public sector the big utilities would be
freed from the inappropriate public spending constraints laid down by the
Treasury and moreover they would have a bigger incentive to run themselves
efficiently. But one of the most important driving forces in the early days
was purely financial: at the time the government still had a big deficit to
finance and after ten years of huge issuance the investment institutions
were satiated with conventional government securities. They wanted equities,
and the pension funds and high income unit trusts in particular wanted those
which paid high and growing dividends. So the government duly created some.
The achievements of these designer equities have been well up to
specification. The UK stock market might have been in a poor state without
them. For example, their dividends have continued to grow at about 10 per
cent a year - the size of Northumbrian Water's increase this week, for
instance - but the All-Share dividends in aggregate have only increased by
about 1 per cent over the past 12 months. So non-utility dividends have not
grown at all. Utilities now pay out 13 per cent of the dividends distributed
by the 655 All-Share constituents and they account for 18 per cent of the
total earnings. Given that, say, 40 per cent of profits are earned abroad,
utility profits represent about 30 per cent of all the domestic earnings of
British quoted companies. This is not just good, it is much too good.
Admittedly this is a somewhat distorted picture in the depths of a recession
which has reduced the profits of the bulk of the corporate sector. But this,
too, raises the question of why utilities are able to escape the agony of so
many of their business customers - a question highlighted this week by the
battle between British Telecom and the retiring telecommunications regulator
and new Office of Fair Trading boss, Sir Bryan Carsberg. Gross trading
profits of the corporate sector peaked at 15 per cent of GDP in late 1988,
but have now fallen to about 11.5 per cent. Utilities have not shared in
that squeeze. The worry is that the creation of a profit-conscious utility
sector ready to exploit its monopoly position for commercial gain is doing
serious harm to the competitiveness of the rest of the economy.
Now, the arguments here are complex. Privatised utilities have been
subjected to regulators in order to prevent monopoly abuse. In these areas
Britain has adopted an RPI minus x formula for regulation, which in some
cases has become very tight: at BT, x started at 3 per cent at the time of
the 1984 prospectus, but has since grown to 6 1/4 per cent and is proposed
at 7 1/2 per cent for next year. Whatever the precise figures, this is a
better approach than simple cost-plus, especially for industries where
technology is changing fast. Under the RPI minus x formula utility companies
have an incentive (and maybe a necessity) to cut their costs and reap
rewards. But it is hard for regulators to judge just how much scope there is
for improving efficiency.
The old nationalised industries, apart from being under the thumb of
price-fixing politicians, often seemed to be run for the sake of a quiet
life at the top and to reward huge workforces. The bigger the workforce the
more likely was the boss to get a knighthood. Now, it seems, the priorities
are different. PowerGen cut its workforce by some 25 per cent last year. And
as the x factor bites the P45s are proliferating at BT too: its UK payroll
numbers have shrunk from 239,000 at the end of 1990 to 221,000 last year,
and expected to fall to under 190,000 by the spring of 1993.
To the extent that the labour force is bearing the pain, the extra profits
earned by the utilities may not, after all, be at the expense of the rest of
the company sector. Yet in a low growth economy the case for high utility
profits is weaker because investment requirements are lower: the UK economy
will only achieve about the same output in 1992 as in 1988, so there is
scarcely the same need to expand the infrastructure as there seemed to be in
the mid-80s when an economic 'miracle' had propelled growth to 4 per cent a
year.
Where does this leave shareholders? One reason for distributing shares
around millions of Sids was to ensure that there would be a more influential
constituency than just the pension funds. Even so the political risks have
seemed scary at times: water was under a particular cloud ahead of the
election, but the sector index jumped by a third afterwards.
Besides the electoral risks, investors will probably become aware of other
cycles as they acquire experience. The economic cycle will be at its most
favourable during the downturn when utilities are faring much better than
most other companies. During a general period of earnings recovery they will
appear rather dull.
Fundamentally, however, you would expect utility company shares to be
sensitive to economic growth, or the lack of it. That is why it is worrying
that share prices in the sector appear to have been sustained by
backward-looking dividends rather than by forward-looking growth
projections.
But there is no need to be a killjoy: if you see Sid, don't tell him.

FT  13 JUN 92 / Arts: Soul's little madam
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LISA Stansfield is in danger of turning into a proper little madam. When
last seen, a couple of years ago, this fantasy figure who made an ass of
pure reason by coming from nowhere - well, Rochdale actually - to top the US
soul charts, retained a Lancashire lass charm. With her cap worn the wrong
round and a tendency to skip around the stage like a mixed infant allowed
home early, she undermined the critical faculties with the same ease as Our
Gracie.
Now, at Wembley, millions of record sales later, she lies astride a packing
case stroking her body meaningfully and nibbling her hand mike with all the
subtlety of Ruby Wax as she purrs 'Time to make you mine'. Lisa seems
destined to join Olivia Newton-John and Sheena Easton as a nut-brown
Hollywood Queen, dragging herself away from the pool to do Vegas.
Fortunately she still gives a northern stretch to the 'a' as she tells us we
are free to 'dance', but it took two pointed reminders before the Wembley
crowd staggered to its feet to boogie modestly. To the nation's loss, Lisa
Stansfield has been transformed into a soul superstar with a packaged show
of faceless musicians.
At the start the packaging was too constricting. Bass and percussion were
winning over a voice which is still packed with power but bereft of
sensitivity. Gradually things fell into shape, especially on the slower
numbers, but there was plenty of time to think about her outfit - initially
frock coat over black stockings, then hot pants and Rochdale Hornet yellow
and black striped blouse - and her appearance (a forties perm and shiney
make-up) rather than to be transported away on that old soul train.
The old hits - 'All around the world'; 'This is the right time' - were kept
for the end, but by then I was nostalgic for the pert 24-year-old who was
still so in love with music, and her own voice, that she could try out
Billie Holiday's haunting 'Good Morning Heartbreak' in the middle of her
set. This 26-year-old is in danger of falling into that strange irony
whereby soul singers inevitably pervert the emotional intensity that is the
source of soul music into a mechanical, beat dominated, superficiality of
showmanship.

FT  13 JUN 92 / Arts: United front falls apart - Susan Moore finds discord
at the Grosvenor House fair
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SUSAN MOORE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Grosvenor House antiques fair is supposed to be an event at which the
British art and antiques trades unite to wow the world. It is as much a
showcase as a marketplace, a triumphant annual display of excellence that
confirms London's position as the centre of the international art market.
Traditionally, it is where top dealers unveil sensational stock to the
world's richest and most serious collectors, who queue around the block for
the privilege of buying it. The fair is also the dealers' trump card played
against the auction houses which have been whittling away their business for
years.
In these lean times, it is more important than ever that the dealers stand
together and that Grosvenor House fields the top names and the finest
pieces. That is what makes this year's charade over the object judged
Artefact of the Year so lamentably self-destructive.
The object so honoured by five independent and academic judges of the annual
award - which is supported by The Burlington Magazine - is a small
Franco-Burgundian pendant jewel of around 1400. It belongs to Wartski, a
firm distinguished by its scholarship as well as its extraordinary number of
royal warrants.
The jewel takes the form of a triptych, its rock crystal ogee-arched doors
opening to reveal a free-standing gold and enamel relief of the Madonna and
Child above a double reliquary compartment. Only 30 Burgundian jewels of the
period are recorded, and this much-published piece is one of the few outside
public collections.
Its recent fate is also remarkable. This Artefact of the Year initially was
rejected by members of the fair's vetting committee. Stranger still, the
same vetting group had raised no objection when it was exhibited at
Grosvenor House last year. These vets, predominantly other exhibiting
jewellers, now felt it was a composite piece. Wartski, and others, felt the
presence of the green-eyed monster.
Director Kenneth Snowman contacted the council of the British antique
dealers' association (BADA). A group of museum experts was called in and,
unanimously, accepted the authenticity of the piece. It is thought to be the
first instance of an appeal being upheld at Grosvenor House. The result was
that the jewel came to the fair and won an award, but Wartski will never
exhibit there again.
For three years, the firm has asked for independent scholars on the vetting
committee in equal proportion to the exhibiting dealers. Perhaps it is about
time BADA put its house in order.
Does the fact that the Artefact of the Year was also exhibited last year
mean there are too few blue-chip works of art fresh to this year's fair?
Certainly, it seems that most dealers are playing safe, hoping to sell in
the middle range. Wednesday's opening day did see all the big money but
there was activity only on works bearing price tags with a moderate number
of zeros, from jades at Spink and clocks at Anthony Woodburn to Leger's
small Hogarth and Ackermann &amp; Johnson's Herring.
The following day, however, Johnny van Haeften sold his exotic Brazilian
landscape by Frans Post to a new client for around Pounds 400,000. It also
revealed the dealers who cannot but make a splash.
Jonathan Harris again revealed his distinctive, idiosyncratic taste for all
that is bold and quirky in English furniture. He shows a swagger pair of
sculptural gilt-wood armchairs designed by John Vardy for Spencer House
around 1758. Commissioned by the 1st Earl Spencer, and more recently in the
possession of Henry Ford II, the chairs seem to represent perfectly the
fair's theme of Anglo-American patronage. Their price: Pounds 360,000.
Alongside architectural Mayhew &amp; Ince, we also find a pair of monumental
19th century Anglo-Indian stools - even an Indonesian zither in the form of
a crocodile.
Peter Tillou presents another wonderful, richly-varied stand. In pride of
place hangs Ammi Phillips' portrait of the 18-month old Andrew Jackson Ten
Broeck of 1834, resplendent in his scarlet dress, and among the four or five
masterpieces of American folk painting (Dollars 1.4m or Pounds 850,000).
Of museum quality again is his exceptional pair of flintlock, silver-mounted
duelling pistols by Samuel Brunn of around 1800, believed traditionally to
have been made for the Prince Regent (Pounds 85,000). Other goodies also are
less obviously displayed. Note Alex Wengraf's School of Fontainebleu
statuette of a stag, and Bill Drummond's small gem of Dahl clouds by
moonlight.
Good pictures are sprinkled liberally throughout the fair. Newhouse offers a
delightful pair of Boucher landscapes for Pounds 1.95m. The prize for the
strangest - and most erotic - painting on show must go to the David and
Goliath at Richard Feigen. In this self-portrait, Zoffany depicts himself
not as the vanquished Goliath like Caravaggio but as a cool, smiling David.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BA YOUNG

<TEXT>
ON WEDNESDAY, the first Ecology Debate on Radio 3 was presented by Fred
Pearce, of the New Scientist. It covered, broadly, the business of the Earth
Summit at Rio, although not from a wholly green angle, nor with immediate
relevance to the proceedings.
Professor Jim Lovelock reassured us that the planet was robust enough to
meet its challenges; where once was the ichthyosaurus, now there was the
dolphin. 'Forecasts of doom are always wrong,' Julian Simon said;
industrialisation gave the wealth that provided the clean environment.
Humanity's lot had always improved, with a longer life expectancy and a
constant supply of required materials. Only Richard Sandbrook contrasted
western social considerations with the rising poverty of backward peoples.
Nicholas Hildyard maintained that humans were part of the environment. There
could be social conditions of mutual benefit - in his example, elephant
'poaching' should be authorised to provide ivory profits for the people. A
second ecological debate comes next week, but it is to deal mostly with
familiar matters, and there was a feature last week on over-population.
Topically, Radio 4 repeated, as its Monday afternoon play, Bruce Stewart's
The Culper Tapes. This supposes a belief that the world is coming to an end,
but on religious, not scientific, grounds.
The prophet Elijah is about to return and, on Mount Carmel, Christians, Jews
and Moslems are in conference. Felix Culper, covering this for the Third
Programme, has recorded a mysterious voice, then been sacked - and taken his
tapes with him.
Clare (Imogen Stubbs), a new features producer, is determined to get them
back and visits every potential contact, including Culper on a terminal
deathbed. It all works out a bit like science-fiction, and is full of
incident. Shaun MacLaughlan directed.
Monday evening gave something more serious, Who Killed Palomino Molero? by
Mario Vargas Llosa. 'Holy Mother]' it begins, 'My God]' - and then you hear
the insects buzzing round the disgustingly murdered body of Palomino. The
script is so full of such detail, sexual and physical, that many a director
might have cut, but Ned Chaillet gives us the works.
The scene is Peru in 1964 under a military dictatorship. Palomino was a
romantic young deserter from the air force; who killed him is not the only
problem, for the air force colonel and his flashy daughter are killed before
the tale is done.
Events are seen from the standpoint of two policemen, Lieutenant Silva
(Charles Simpson) and Sergeant Libuna (Ray Fearon), who have no authority
over the military.
Besides all the sex relations, there is talk of the Big Fish of the
contrabandistas, but the splendidly complex plot never marks the killers.
Finally, the policemen are transferred discreetly to some distant region.
This was outstanding radio.
The arts strategy debate was concluded on Wednesday with a panel including
Sir Richard Luce, who proposed the scheme when he was arts minister, and
Anthony Everitt, secretary-general of the Arts Council. 'Key priorities' was
the catchword, the foremost of them, naturally, costing.
Of the great 170-page document itself, Tony Banks, MP, argued that it
dismissed the social role of the arts too lightly; Luce that it said too
little about administration. But it will all come up again in September when
it will be the business of David Mellor, the new minister; and the debaters
all had confidence in him.

FT  13 JUN 92 / Arts: Mixed duets from Deutsche - Records
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW CLEMENTS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR ONE record company, it seems, discs of piano music must now enter the
catalogue two by two. This year Deutsche Grammophon has released new
recordings by Pollini, Pogorelich, Gavrilov and Ugorski, all of them in
pairs. They offer some fascinating comparisons; the piano sound is
immaculate, and there is a great deal of fearsome technique on display.
Anatol Ugorski is the least known of the quartet: he is Russian by birth,
was trained and later himself taught at the Leningrad Conservatory, and
championed a good deal of contemporary music in the Soviet Union before
emigrating to Germany in 1990. On the evidence of these discs his playing
has the potential for brilliance; in both Beethoven's Diabelli Variations
(435 615-2) and Musorgsky's Pictures at an Exhibition and Stravinsky's
Petrushka movements (435 616-2) he shows he has some strong musical ideas,
too.
They, though, are the problem. For the way Ugorski fusses with Pictures,
imposing a steady acclerando on the last movement which quite destroys its
monumentality, nudging the Stravinsky pieces until they become rhythmically
unstable, succeeds only in over-interpretation and drawing attention to
itself. His Diabelli is more problematic, less easy to dismiss as wilful or
contrived. It contains some marvellous things, with playing of great
muscularity and tension to set alongside the most poetic effects; somehow,
though, it manages to miss the work's core; the 31st variation, the
rhapsodic Largo, is full of exquisite sounds yet remains earthbound,
detached.
Maurizio Pollini's Chopin and Beethoven may be thoroughly known quantities,
but his recordings of those composers has been by no means consistent. I
would argue that the coupling of the Chopin Scherzi with the Berceuse and
Barcarolle (431 623-2) is by some margin the least successful recording
Pollini has made, harshly driven and garish in its tone, never allowing any
space around the music for fantasy or expressive invention. The Beethoven -
the two sonatas of Op. 27 with the D major Op. 28 (427 770-2) - is more
acceptable, but still severe and short on charm. It is hard to reconcile
these performances with those of the Pollini one admired so enormously a
decade ago, when the detachment was balanced by such refinement of phrase
and colour, and a real sense of musical purpose. Now only the brittle
surface seems to remain.
Andrei Gavrilov at least continues to develop in an interesting and
rewarding fashion. The waywardness and indulgence once so characteristic of
his playing have been brought under control, and discs of Prokofiev Sonatas
(Nos 3, 7 and 8; 435 439-2) and Chopin's Four Ballades and B flat Minor
Sonata (435 622-2) show a disciplined approach. Indeed the Prokofiev is
almost too cool and careful, unfolding all three sonatas without any sense
of hurry and never quite enough nervous energy. But his Chopin is constantly
on the move, urged forward with little surges and emphases. It becomes
wearing in the sonata, which needs a greater feeling of sweep and command,
but is exciting and appropriate in the Ballades, as the tension of each is
consistently sustained.
Ivo Pogorelich offers Haydn on one of his discs and Liszt and Skryabin on
the other. We do not get to hear Pogorelich in London these days; he feels
his art goes unappreciated here. It is useful then to be reminded what a
hugely talented pianist he is, even if that talent is sometimes misapplied.
The Haydn sonatas (Nos 19 and 46; 435 618-2) are not particularly stylish,
or even well shaped, but full of gorgeously coloured effects and sometimes
miraculous articulation. The account of the Liszt sonata (with Skryabin's
Second; 429 391-2) is a tremendous tour de force, terrifying in its dynamic
range and tonal power.
Away from the pianistic mainstream, Viktoria Postnikova's coupling of
Tchaikovsky's The Seasons with his Piano Sonata Op 80 (Erato 2292 45512-2)
fills an interesting niche. The sonata is not the familiar G minor work, but
the early (1865) effort in C sharp minor, given a misleadingly late opus
number when it was revised for posthumous publication by Taneyev. Its
recycled Germanic romanticism needs careful coaxing and a steadying hand in
the wilder rhetorical outbursts; both of those Postnikova generally
supplies. She is convincing, too, in most of the pieces that make up The
Seasons, though the more Schumannesque numbers require the magic of a
Richter to bring them fully to life.
Finally, Peter Hill's pilgrimage through the piano music of Messiaen has
reached the Vingts Regards de l'Enfant-Jesus (Unicorn-Kanchana DKP 9122/23,
two CDs). Hill's series has grown in stature and accomplishment as it has
progressed; now every instalment appears decisively authoritative. There are
many wonderful things in the new set, pieces imbued with a genuine sense of
awe and majesty, others fined down to the most intimate meditations. Such
performances take Messiaen's piano music right out of the category of
special interest and into the centre of the pianistic tradition, revealing a
work that demands alternative interpretations just as surely as the Liszt
sonata or Beethoven's Hammerklavier.

<TEXT>
starting late because of the London Underground bomb scare - and, because I
was among the many who missed its first minutes, I want to give it what
credit I can. Mainly credit for its strange nerve.
To turn a Ruth Rendell mystery into a musical is a surprising idea; yet,
that is only for starters. You are told who did what to whom at the start,
and even why (kind of). The rest of the action is a social-interest
run-through of events leading up to the mass murder.
Since all the characters are more or less stock types, they are all treated
with a heavy dose of satire. One actor keeps stepping in and out of
character to narrate, several characters sometimes stand on the sidelines
and speak comments into microphones, and the murderess steps out of
character to address us in her final song.
All this makes it a deliberate deconstruction of the Ruth Rendell type of
whodunnit. But do not get the impression that writer Neil Bartlett and
composer Nicolas Bloomfield have planned this as an intellectual show.
Actually, it's just camp.
The worst factor is the music. Bloomfield attempts a variety of genres to
suit the various situations - music hall, operetta, hymn, etc. - and all of
them rob the characters of spontaneity and credibility. Worst, the vocal
lines are written too high for every member of the cast, and lead them up
into shouts, yelps and falsetto.
Beverley Klein has to zigzag between narration and playing the
scandal-mongering village postmistress. Either mode enables her to play
broadly to the audience; she isn't subtle, and her vibrato is corrugated,
but she is the liveliest thing on stage. Sheila Hancock, as the unlettered
housekeeper-cum-murderess, gives a physical performance of marvellous
inarticulate intensity and detail, but sounds like a re-run of her several
Cockney roles each time she opens her mouth.
The members of the victim Coverdale family are cast in a
operetta-to-Sondheim mould. The daughter Melinda has to manage tricky upward
leaps of a ninth in midword in her big number; Maria Kesselman, the purest
singer in the cast, handles this with ease. As the parents, Elizabeth Brice
sings like an out-of-tune English rose and Emile Belcourt brays and bleats
in long phrases and an inappropriately Canadian accent. Their big, limp love
duet sounds as if it would burst into I'd Give Anything from Oliver if only
it had the energy.
A Judgement in Stone, Lyric, Hammersmith, until July 4.

PERSISTENT RUMOURS by Lee Langley Heinemann Pounds 14.95, 294 pages
THE TAP DANCER by Andrew Barrow Duckworth Pounds 14.99, 181 pages
THE SILENT DUCHESS by Dacia Maraini Peter Owen Pounds 14.99, 235 pages
IN THE old days, British families in India sent their children home to
school at the age of seven or eight. No one thought it odd. But in
Persistent Rumours, having sent him away (thus proving to the child that she
does not love him), James's mother dies, abandoning him twice over. The rest
of his seemingly successful life, with its successful marriage (for he is
lucky to find the loving, patient Daisy), is spent trying to solve the
mystery and fill the emptiness.
The headmaster told him that she was drowned in a shipwreck off one of the
Andaman Islands. Later, he returns to his birthplace and hears the rumours.
Were there any survivors? Had they a hope among the ferocious cannibals? In
old age, determined to discover more, he revisits the Andamans with Daisy.
What he finds is dramatic and startling; but it is revealed with such
tenderness and credibility that, for all the macabre facts uncovered, it
makes psychological truth and a sort of circular sense out of James's
fractured life and unlovable personality. Daisy, the quiet heroine, is there
to pick up, quite literally, what remains.
Beautifully constructed, the story switches between times and generations in
a complex but unconfusing way. At the human level, much is said, obliquely,
about deprivation, love and lovelessness, memory, fidelity, the life of the
heart and senses, and the limitations of reason. At the intellectual level
it makes sense of an ancient mystery, uncovering clues and trailing those
elusive rumours. The visual climax, in which what happened is shown as if by
lightning, in a flash of childhood memory that tells everything, is at once
haunting and brilliant; and the colonial past, the islands' savage
inheritance, is linked with today's world in the figures of two old men
facing each other briefly across a stretch of water: possibly brothers. With
such touches - economy of means, richness of feeling and suggestion - this
post-colonial story makes its point.
The Tap Dancer is another tale of parents and children but with a staid
chronological technique, a narrative running straight along a decade or so.
Richard, Tim, Edward, William and Ben are the sons of a manic, ill-tempered
and ill-natured domestic tyrant; William is the narrator.
Father has no friends and no noticeable relationship with his meek wife. A
bully and a bore, he hates homosexuals, Jews, socialists, Roman Catholics,
'redbrick university cattle' - indeed, almost everyone. Liberals who think
views like his no longer exist in civilised society should take a look at
him, for he clearly exists and in every phrase rings true. The present
accepted ideas of democracy, tolerance and decency of speech and feeling
have never come near him. Out of this public-school Alf Garnett, Andrew
Barrow has made a comic masterpiece about a fascist beast far superior to
Nancy Mitford's one-dimensional old horror, Fa.
Full of sidelong observations and oblique goings-on, discursive events and
apparently pointless but cumulatively powerful detail, the narrative reminds
me of the magnificent, unemphatic fiction of Natalia Ginzberg, who was
everything Father would have hated - Jewish, left-wing, intellectual,
foreign. From Wiltshire to the Isle of Man, with occasional outings to
London, we follow the progress of Father, poor put-upon Mummy, their dogs,
their endless domestic crises.
Barrow has a voice and a style to be taken seriously, and his first novel
has more valuable social comment than many a tale of trendy manners; Father,
tap-dancing weirdly across the kitchen in moments of glee, has immense
vitality and, what is odder, even a certain humanity.
By comparison, The Silent Duchess, despite an exotic subject, is wan and
forgettable. Taken at the age of seven to watch a 13-year-old boy hanged in
Palermo, married at 13 to her middle-aged uncle, Marianna, who is
deaf-and-dumb, watches the world and sniffs its smells with a highly
developed nose. Her life-story in the barbarous 18th-century Sicilian
aristocracy is told with a minute realism that is the book's best quality.
But a touch of magic - she can read people's thoughts - doesn't work, and
the longish pieces of monologue from servants vary the tone but fail to
persuade. Crammed with information which is interesting but unable on its
own to make a satisfying novel, the book fails because its characters are
unmemorable. Marianna has little but the pathos of her circumstances,
lumbered as she is with the man she calls uncle husband - brutal in bed but,
considering Sicilian husbands in general, not so bad out of it.

FT  13 JUN 92 / Arts: Christie's magic with the fairies - Off the Wall /
Dadd's record may not mean a Victorian revival
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WELL, Christie's pulled it off. In spite of a whacking estimate of up to
Pounds 1.5m. it managed to sell Richard Dadd's painting, 'Contradiction',
for Pounds 1.65m. yesterday, a record for any Victorian picture.
Dadd painted the famous oval canvas of Oberon and Titania arguing about the
changeling boy over four years. He had plenty of time: he was locked up in
Bedlam for the murder of his father who he mistook for the Devil.
One of the most famous of fairy pictures it nicely mirrors the ups and downs
in demand for Victorian art. In 1870, a decade or so after it was completed,
it was valued at 136 guineas. In 1964 Thomas Laughton, brother of the more
famous Charles, sold it for Pounds 7,000. By 1983, just as the mania for
Victorian art was approaching its peak, it made Pounds 550,000, at
Sotheby's, to the American corporate collector Myron Kunin, at the time a
record price for a work of the period. Yesterday the buyer was the dealer
Jackie King and it would be surprising if her client was British. Another
big export row is on the cards.
The Dadd is so unusual that it is hardly typical of the Victorian market,
which has been very depressed recently. Christie's sale totalled almost
Pounds 3.5m. with over 81 per cent sold. One of the most famous icons of the
period, Luke Filde's 'The village wedding', showing the happy couple
parading down the street followed by villagers, hung, in print form, in a
million homes. It was on target yesterday at Pounds 275,000. The work was
much admired in its day and sold for 1,095 guineas in 1886. By 1982 it had
sunk to Pounds 38,500, and proved a good buy.
Two other paintings reflect the changing fortunes of Victorian art. Edward
Ward's weepy 'Last parting of Marie Antoinette and her Son' was regarded as
the ultimate in Victorian sentimentality when it was offered at Christie's
in 1957. It sold for ten guineas. Yesterday it found a new owner at Pounds
104,500.
And Evelyn Waugh was obviously a man before, rather than behind, his time.
He collected Victorian paintings when they went for peanuts and owned 'The
Upset Flower Cart' by W W Atkinson. After his death it fetched a paltry
Pounds 770 in 1971. Yesterday it was valued at Pounds 66,000.
Dealers in Victorian art should have been pleased at the success of the sale
but many were hoping for a poor result which would publicly reduce
expectations and prices. Only then, they feel, will buyers for anything but
celebrated images be tempted back.
On Monday the London Mozart Players will be performing at the Fairfield Hall
in Croydon in a concert sponsored by Nestle UK. Nothing remarkable about
that. Fairfield Hall is the home of the LMP and Nestle is its big backer.
But the concert is an omen. In September a recording of the concert will be
transmitted on Thames TV. It will be introduced by Peter Blackburn, chairman
of Nestle. Sponsored arts programmes will have arrived in the UK. As well as
a plug for the company in the credits the hour long programme will carry a
commercial break replete with commercials for Nestle brands. The deal has
been put together by Something of Consequence, a company which specialises
in making sponsored performing arts programmes.
The Ashes must be at the heart of one of the most romantic of sporting
stories. An Australian victory in the Test; the ceremonial burning of the
bails; the departure abroad with the relic entombed in a vase; their rare
return to the UK when the English score a cricket win, only to be hidden in
the holy of holies at Lord's, away from the public gaze.
But this autumn the Ashes should be on view (insured for Pounds 1m.) at an
exhibition of sporting trophies at the Victoria &amp; Albert Museum, along with
around 500 prizes of historic, decorative, or amusing interest. The show is
the inspiration of Lord Burghesh, whose grandfather mounted a similar
exhibition in the 1930s. So great is his commitment that he has pledged
Pounds 1m towards its success.
Where do stocks come from, apart from brokers? From sticks, of course. That
is how the word originated, back in the 12th century. The Royal Exchequer
cut tally sticks from trees on the banks of the Thames near Westminster.
When a deal was done a stick was split down the middle with each party
keeping a perfectly matching half.
Over the centuries the Exchequer accumulated millions of these totally
redundant sticks. In 1834 it decided to make a bonfire of them all - and
proceeded to burn down the old Palace of Westminster. Few tally sticks
survived the conflagration, but Sotheby's is offering a group of 21, dating
from the mid-13th century, on June 23. They were probably stolen from the
blaze and are now estimated at up to Pounds 15,000.
Among the payments inscribed along the sides are Pounds 6 13s 4d from the
Abbot of Abingdon towards the knighting of Prince Edward, the son of King
Henry III, and Pounds 3 6s 8d from John de Turbevil for contempt. There was
obviously money in titles and libels even in those days.
Rhetoric as an art form has been out of favour for the last few centuries
but there are signs that it is making a come back. Companies seem prepared
to pay good money to listen to the puppy politicians at the Oxford Union
indulge in laboured speechifying.
The Oxford debates have become an unlikely form of corporate entertain-ment.
Last month Vanity Fair (wisely jetting in its own main speakers) organised a
special debate on whether it was better to be governed by sinners rather
than saints (the sinners won), and this week Time Magazine financed an arts
versus science ding dong.
It costs around Pounds 1,500 to back a debate in the autumn term, with an
audience of 1,400 students crowding in, nearer Pounds 500 in the exam
infested summer term, and, whatever the corporate guests think about it all,
the companies get the chance for some discreet head hunting over the dinner.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN AMIDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LOST FATHER by Mona Simpson Faber &amp; Faber Pounds 14.99, 506 pages
MONA SIMPSON'S critically acclaimed 1986 debut novel, Anywhere But Here,
provided an exhaustively detailed account of a relationship between a mother
and daughter. Now, in her follow-up, The Lost Father, Simpson explores the
relationship between that daughter, Mayan Stevenson, and her father, a
wayward Egyptian-born professor, John Atassi. The difference is that the
father is absent, having disappeared when Mayan was a young girl into the
vast American wilderness of unlisted phone numbers and unregistered
employment.
Mayan is now 28, a lonely medical student living in New York City. Acutely
aware that her unresolved feelings for her dad are causing her deep
emotional trouble, especially with men, she decides to hunt him down. She
hires private detectives, phones the FBI and badgers distant relatives.
Gradually, finding John Atassi becomes an obsession, dominating her waking
life and clouding her dreams. Her life savings are soon exhausted, her
relationships with friends and lovers compromised. And yet, the shards of
information she picks up prove more frustrating than enlightening, painting
a cubist portrait of a wastrel and con-man who does not want to be found.
Undaunted, Mayan sets out in search of him, to Wisconsin, to the Montana
college where her father worked, even to his Egyptian birthplace. Gradually,
the strain begins to take its toll on her, not simply the wear and tear of
the search but also the psychic bruising brought about by accepting the fact
that he has well and truly abandoned her. She is afflicted by the cruel
truth that 'all you have to do to become somebody's God is disappear.' Just
when she seems on the verge of wrecking her life she finds him, living a
life of unrivalled blandness. He is no god at all, but rather a charming,
spineless has-been feeding on dreams of missed glory. Having finally purged
the demon of his absence, Mayan feels she can now get on with her life.
The bare bones of this book suggest that it could have been compelling
reading - there is something almost mythical about Simpson's overall
conception, the way Mayan must travel though a labyrinth of dead-ends and
trick corridors before coming to the truth. Some scenes are good enough to
make you almost believe that the author deserves the ridiculously fulsome
accolades heaped upon her by US critics.
But, in the end, The Lost Father is crushed by the weight of its own detail.
What could have been a effective 200-page tale becomes an unmanageable
behemoth at over 500. Every time I felt myself getting caught up in Mayan's
quest I was shunted off into a digression, usually a bit of writing school
bravado. All this talent serves to remind you that it is the author speaking
rather than her heroine, depriving the book of much of its potential
emotional sting. Equally disappointing is the book's resolution, which
degenerates into a series of aphorisms that add nothing to the book's
psychological weight.

CRYSTAL ROOMS by Melvyn Bragg Hodder &amp; Stoughton Pounds 14.99, 342 pages
STRIKER by Hunter Davies Bloomsbury Pounds 9.99, 247 pages
THE BROKEN LANDS by Robert Edric Cape Pounds 15.99, 278 pages
SODOMIES IN ELEVEN POINT by Aldo Busi Faber &amp; Faber Pounds 14.99, 343 pages
THERE WAS a bit of a stir in the literary world last year when Melvyn
Bragg's current novel, Crystal Rooms, was first serialised in Esquire
magazine. It contained an acid character sketch of a female reporter with
'feet too big, legs egg-white, hairless and stocky, topped by sumo thighs'
leading up to 'belly folds that cascaded over a crotch once boasted as (and
still) insatiable.' Popular opinion had it that this was a revenge attack on
a well-known London journalist, whose last interview with Bragg had savaged
both the man and his previous novel, A Time to Dance. Whatever the truth of
the matter, Martha Potter is certainly a pretty unpleasant character in the
book, both physically and behaviourally. She sleeps around, looks for
victims to mug in print, and gets up to all sorts of abstruse behaviour that
no nice person would ever contemplate. But she is not alone, because
everyone else in the book is pretty unpleasant as well, whether they are
paedophiliac MPs, ageing TV whizz kids, glamorous talking heads or elderly
financiers who have seen better days. Almost the only decent character is
11-year-old Harry, an orphan from the North, who is brought to London by his
aunt's boyfriend and abandoned outside the Crystal Rooms amusement arcade in
Leicester Square.
There he is picked up by a friendly adult who plans to sell him as fresh
meat to the paedophile MP. But the plan comes unstuck when the MP falls
chastely in love with the boy and whisks him out of harm's way, lodging him
with a TV friend who lost her own son in an accident and has never been the
same since.
What happens to Harry after that is something of a puzzle however, because
the story suddenly divides into several different plot lines, like an
exploding firework, and the reader is left gaping at the various bits of it.
Suffice it to say that there is a terrorist assassin in the plot, some
masturbation, sexual coupling, power lunches - lots of those - and a great
deal about the world of television and the shallow people who inhabit it.
The book rattles along smoothly enough and is particularly good, almost
Dickensian, when dealing with the trials of young Harry. But he is not on
stage very often, and when he isn't it is hard to know who the leading
character is or what, in a sentence, the story is about  - a legacy perhaps
of its original appearance as a five-part serial.
Striker, by Hunter Davies, is a rather less complex read, the alleged
autobiography of Joe Swift - soccer star, ladies' man, and ultimate English
sporting hero. The story begins in the back streets of Durham and progresses
via Roy of the Rovers and trials at Carlisle and Newcastle to an
apprenticeship with Spurs and training sessions in the same squad as - gulp
 -Glen Hoddle and Garth Crooks.
There are women on the way, huge babysitters to start with, then London
pickups, then flashy model girls as Joe makes the first team and eventually
the England side. He becomes a hero abroad as well as at home, being
transferred first to the German league and then to the Italian, for
increasingly large sums of money.
At the end of every chapter he shows his manuscript to the people he has
written about, who write back to him with a totally different, often
hilarious recollection of events. It is an agreeable romp, told
unpretentiously by a writer who keeps his tongue firmly in his cheek
throughout.
The Broken Lands, by Robert Edric, recreates the story of Sir John
Franklin's search for a north-west passage around the top of Canada, a
search which began with high hopes in 1845 and ended with nothing further
being heard of the expedition for more than a decade. The author has delved
into the archives and come up with a grim tale of tongues cut out, mad dogs
hanged on gallows, food adulterated by red lead, suicide, snow blindness,
lips lost to frostbite and almost every other Arctic horror you could
imagine.
It ought to be good - and is, up to a point - but there is an awkwardness
about the writing that leaves the reader not entirely comfortable with the
log-like progression of the narrative. The characters stumble on through the
snow, dropping out one by one until hardly anyone is still alive. As a
recreation of events it is true enough, but as the plot for a novel it could
have done with more pace and tension.
Aldo Busi's Sodomies in Eleven Point, ably translated by Stuart Hood, is not
really a novel at all. The main character, for one thing, is Aldo Busi. He
writes in the first person and regales us with a seemingly endless list of
homosexual encounters, beginning with an Italian youth seduced through a
fence on page two, and progressing from there to Morocco and Tunis and more
pickups than the average person would ever want to shake a stick at. A very
long stick.
The author digresses on the way, giving us the benefit of his views on life
and literature - some of them only half-coherent and all delivered in
self-obsessed paragraphs which occasionally go on for pages at a time.
Holidaying in Kenya, Busi notes with surprise that only one other person at
the hotel has ever heard of him or his 'novels'. He makes it sound like a
nice place to visit.

DAUGHTER OF PERSIA
by Sattareh Farman
Farmaian Bantam Pounds 16.99, 404 pages
IT HAS become fashionable for exiled Iranians to reminisce, mourning the
passing of a 'Persia' filled with the scent of pomegranates and the loyalty
of loving servants. These accounts are usually written by those deeply
embarrassed by Ayatollah Khomeini's lslamic Republic and anxious to show the
West that an Iran other than one populated with black-turbanned mullahs once
existed.
The strength of Farman Farmaian's book is that she records events that most
families - much less an upper class Iranian one - might choose to ignore.
Such as the time her mother, fed up with having constantly to harangue her
husband for money, used his electric bullhorn to broadcast to the whole
neighbourhood that his children had no shoes. Or that financial and other
pressures on her mother resulted in her hitting Sattareh as a little girl.
Sattareh was one of 36 children born to Abdol Hossein Mirza Farman Farma, a
relative of the Qajar family which ruled Iran for several hundred years
until the beginning of this century. The description of her childhood years
are the most fascinating in the book.
Sattareh was brought up with her siblings and four of her father's eight
wives in his large compound in Tehran. 'I accepted his rule, as did
everyone, with fear and reverence and distant adoration. He was the lodestar
of our busy cosmos and his will held it together.'
Despite having a harem and an autocratic disposition, Farman Farma valued a
good education for his children, whether male or female. To this end,
Sattareh was able to persuade her mother, after her father's death, to allow
her to go to the US to study social work.
Since the Farman Farmaians were involved in Iranian politics, the
autobiography is rooted in the political turmoil afflicting Iran and its
immediate effect on Sattareh's family. The ascent of Reza Shah meant the
forcible loss of much of their land to him. Sattareh, like many others was
delighted at his overthrow, albeit at the hands of the British, during the
Second World War.
She is good at explaining the process by which Iranians came to hate the US.
As a young girl, she admired the US because of the value she thought it set
on liberty and democracy in contrast to the imperialism of the British. But
once Dr Mohammad Mossadegh, who nationalised the Anglo-Iranian oil company,
came to power in 1951, 'It was the beginning of a long, complex tragedy that
would alter forever what I and other Iranians felt about America.' Mossadegh
was overthrown in a CIA-funded operation drawn up by an irate British
government.
Once back in Iran, Sattareh founded the Tehran School of Social Work. But
Sattareh was to see her life's work in ruins when Islamic students took over
the school during the 1979 revolution and compiled a dossier denouncing her
as a counter-revolutionary.
The author's role as a self-appointed saviour of her country can be wearing,
but her story and her views are not predictable, nor does she attempt to
portray herself and her family as innocent victims of fanatical mullahs.
'We, who should have been teachers of the ignorant, did not set an example
of leadership, did not sacrifice ourselves, our careers, our cherished
dreams, to protest what the Shah was doing to us . . . Unlike us, the
mullahs had had guts. They had endured jail and exile. They had let
themselves be beaten, tortured, and killed to destroy the Shah.'

NORTH OXFORD
by Tania Hinchcliffe
Yale Pounds 25, 261 pages
IN ONE of the finest of Oxford novels, The Last Enchantments, Robert Liddell
begins by describing the suburb which sprouted north of the city during
Victoria's later decades: 'Here, on either side of boulevards planted with
chestnuts, is some of the most remarkable domestic architecture in Europe.
Towering yellow brick piles, embellished with purbeck shafts and freestone
copings, house the theological colleges of 'modern churchmen'. In a quarter
of an hour's walk the student can observe examples of almost every kind of
Gothic window: Angevin, Venetian, Spanish and many more. Square and
saddleback towers abound. Further up, there are redbrick mansions, several
of which claim Ruskin as their architect, and show each some remarkable
feature, such as a carved pediment to a porch, or a lavish display of
dog-tooth ornament.'
Appreciation for North Oxford was not universal at the time Liddell wrote,
and the suburb has not yet wholly emerged from the welter of controversy;
there will always be dislikers of Victorian Gothic who find it, in another
critic's phrase, 'arid and gloomy'; but gradually the suburb's splendour and
its importance as a complete achievement, a planned Victorian mixed
development displaying a marvellous repertoire of style and decoration, have
grown on the discernment and affections of the city and of architectural
historians alike, with the happy result that only a few of the plans for
redevelopment in recent years have been allowed to go through.
In her fully-illustrated and detailed discussion of North Oxford, the first
ever written, Tanis Hinchcliffe recounts the suburb's history and takes us
almost house by house through its streets. The land it occupies belonged
(much of it still does) to St John's College. Northwards beyond St John's
gates, in the direction of Banbury, lay the College's 400 acres of fields, a
territory whose fate the Fellows pondered for many decades before deciding,
sometime about 1850, to venture into property development.
A number of architects were involved as the decades passed, some of them
local, and there was evolution both in the layout of sections of the estate
and in styles of building. Yet an extraordinary unity binds the whole,
reflecting the single guiding inspiration - a native sense of the Gothic -
which prompted it.
In tracing North Oxford's development Hinchcliffe shows that it was not
simply a case - as myth has it - of dons, newly permitted to marry, seeking
capacious residences within strolling distance of their Senior Common Rooms.
It was in fact the non-academic middle class for whom the estate chiefly
grew. But some of the most glorious examples were built for dons.
My college room, where I write this, is in one of the Gothic houses
illustrated in Hinchcliffe's book; and when I look across Banbury Road I see
another, displaying its pointed arches and coloured bricks to the sun.
Perhaps because they are so familiar, these lovely North Oxford buildings do
not have the air of specimens in an architectural museum, in contrast to
some of the older structures in the city's centre.
But perhaps the celebrity which this book promises them will change that;
which is a thought to give pause, for Oxford, except in winter, is already
so clotted with tourists that one can barely move in the Broad and High, and
members of the University, when dressed for business, find themselves
transformed into exhibits by the throngs of camera-wielding visitors. Not
long ago, after examining a doctoral thesis, a colleague and I, habited in
academicals, walked back to college up the High, and were photographed at
every step. Whereas most visitors restricted themselves to one picture, the
cheerfully inquisitive Japanese tourists, whose motto seems to be 'photo
ergo sum', filled whole spools. Now perhaps these cameras will obtrude up St
Giles and along the Banbury and Woodstock Roads, poking into the Gothic
windows and photographing tutorials in progress.
Still, the treasures of North Oxford are a universal possession, and
Hinchcliffe's careful and thorough account of them is to be welcomed
accordingly, even if it means that the inhabitants of these glories among
the cherry and chestnut trees will have to share them.

FT  13 JUN 92 / Books: So what went wrong? - Malcolm Rutherford on Harold
Wilson as Prime Minister
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HAROLD WILSON
by Austen Morgan
Pluto Press Pounds 25, 625 pages
AT THE Labour Party Conference in November 1974 James Callaghan paid an
extraordinary compliment to the prime minister of the day. 'Your
contribution, Harold,' he said, 'in the first 74 years of our birth will
probably never be surpassed, and I doubt very much if it will be equalled.'
Callaghan was right. Harold Wilson won four out of five general elections
for the Labour Party and was prime minister, in separate terms, for more
than eight years. Just before Callaghan spoke, Wilson had been proclaiming
Labour as 'the natural party of government'. Yet the praise was also an
epitaph. Almost from then on, it was downhill all the way. Some people would
say that the decline had begun earlier and even that Wilson was partly
responsible.
Certainly it is going to be difficult to convince future generations of the
degree of enthusiasm - some of it across party lines - going for the Labour
leader when he first became prime minister in 1964, and the belief that
Wilson was a dynamic, witty and likeable man, a bit of a boffin who could
make things happen. A new start was promised, but it did not come. The
obvious questions are what went wrong, and why. Yet there is, I think,
another underlying question which is more important: did people simply
expect too much?
After reading Austen Morgan's long and immensely detailed biography, it is
hard not to conclude that Wilson's governments were much like those that
have followed. There was perhaps one exception: that was the heyday of
Margaret Thatcher around 1985 when she had defeated the miners' strike,
seemed to have come to terms with Europe and to have conquered inflation.
But even for Mrs Thatcher triumph did not last: it was back to party
squabblings (Westland, the poll tax), inflation resurgent, new problems with
Europe and, eventually, her enforced departure.
Wilson began his own account of his 1964-70 administration with the words:
'This book is the record of a government all but a year of whose life was
dominated by an inherited balance of payments problem which was nearing a
crisis at the moment we took office; we lived and governed during a period
when that problem made frenetic speculative attack on Britain both easy and
profitable.' Leaving aside the question of whether his government should
have devalued the pound earlier than it did, the background was even worse
than he suggested.
It was the sheer pressure of events that dominated. There were strikes,
there was Rhodesia, Vietnam, the re-emergence of the troubles in Ireland,
conflicts between defence expenditure and defence commitments, as well as
the ever present dilemma of how to deal with Europe.
Some of the problems have been resolved or have disappeared with time:
Rhodesia, for example. Even then, it did not happen quickly. In the late
1960s, the Wilson government tried to grapple with trade union reform. It
failed, but its Conservative predecessors had scarcely even tried and Edward
Heath was no more successful in the early 1970s. It was left to Mrs Thatcher
to pull it off, but by then - to borrow a phrase - the time was ripe.
Possibly the Wilson cabinet, which had more than the normal share of able
ministers and plenty of fresh blood to call on, should have acted more
decisively to cut public spending at the start. But that again would have
been against the grain of the time. The fact was that people wanted more
public services and thought that they could be financed.
It is sometimes said that many of the alleged failings stemmed from the
nature of the Labour Party. Yet that argument, too, looks less convincing in
retrospect. The truth is that all big political parties are coalitions. Look
at the Tory Party at present as an illustration: it is quarrelling over
Europe just as the Labour Party did under Wilson. John Major's task is to
hold it together while making what progress he can. Wilson would have been
familiar with the problem.
Wilson, in any case, was never much of a socialist. He was an economic
liberal who worked with Beveridge, a wartime civil servant and university
don who simply believed that the economy could be better run, but not
necessarily centralised. The phrase 'bonfire of controls' was his in 1948.
Towards the end of his spell in office in 1969, he was telling the party
conference that while the politics of the 1960s had to do with problems of
economic management, in the 1970s they would have to do with the
environment, which put him somewhat ahead of his time.
Much later Wilson wrote: 'It has never been any part of my political
attitude to tear up society by the roots . . . The best style of government
is like rowing - the ideal solution is to get the boat along as quickly as
possible without turning it over.' By those standards, and with hindsight,
Wilson was not a bad prime minister, certainly in the period 1964-70.
In one area, he was unique in the post-war period: he departed of his own
accord. Morgan dismisses the conspiracy theories and argues persuasively
that Wilson went because he was bored with government and realised, as he
told his press secretary, Joe Haines, that 'when old problems recur I reach
for the old solutions'. That is an admirable admission. The tone of the book
is faintly hostile, which is unfair on the evidence presented. It is not an
easy read, but gets better as it goes on.

VITA AND HAROLD
edited by Nigel Nicolson
Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson Pounds 20, 452 pages
HOW WELL we know them all by now] Vita intent on her garden and her
girlfriends at Sissinghurst. Harold in Teheran, Berlin, London, always at
the centre of power, the perfect diplomat working incessantly while somehow
finding the time to write diaries, biographies, reviews, and to pursue his
discreet affairs with other men. And then there is that other key-player
Violet (Trefusis), Mrs Keppel's daughter, mad about Vita and coming within
an ace of wrecking the Nicolson's marriage and her own, until forced to
retire to her chateau at Saint Loup. The name that stuck in Proust's mind.
And Virginia also mad about Vita, while often mad period.
At least Virginia turned her Vita-madness to good account when she wrote
Vita an extended love-letter in which she fantasised that Vita was an
English nobleman who lived resplendently through four centuries and changed
his sex. She called it Orlando and pretended it was a novel. Vita had no
idea of its existence until it was published in 1928  - as we learn from
this new collection of the letters between Vita and Harold, edited by their
son, Nigel:
'My own darling, (Harold) I write to you in the middle of reading Orlando,
in such a turmoil of excitement and confusion that I scarcely know where (or
who]) I am. It came this morning by first post and I have been reading it
ever since, and am now half way through. Virginia sent it me in a lovely
leather binding - bless her. Oh, Lord how I wonder what you will think of
it. It seems to me more brilliant, more enchanting, more rich and lavish,
than anything she has ever done. It is like a cloak encrusted with jewels
and sprinkled with rose-petals'.
It is good to know that that was her reaction, but do we really need yet
another thick volume of more than 400 pages containing many of the often
daily letters by the partners in what must be the best documented marriage
in contemporary history?
On Harold's side we have already had the three volumes of his Diary, the
later one-volume condensed version of it, including new material and letters
at times over-lapping with those printed here, and the two volume biography
of him by James Lees-Milne. On Vita's side we have previously had her own
account of the affair with Violet published by Nigel Nicolson in Portrait of
a Marriage followed by the frank biography by Victoria Glendinning, then the
letters Violet to Vita, and the many missives to Vita and entries about her
in the letters and diaries of Virginia. Fascinating as all these folk were,
is not enough enough?
Well, the short answer to that is, yes; but even so I found myself avidly
reading on. What we have not had before quite so fully is the situation seen
through Vita's eyes, giving us the chance to overhear the continual marital
discourse between the pair. Vita's letters to Harold have hitherto been the
missing pieces in the jigsaw and now they fall into place. It helps to abate
the sense of surfeit that both of them were absolutely superb letter-writers
capable of dashing off a marvellous letter at any time of the day or night
however busy or tired.
Harold's are full of fly-on-the-wall setpieces about the great and the good,
as on that occasion at the Villa Mauresque, chez Mr Maugham, when the Duke
and Duchess of Windsor arrived for dinner: 'He had on a tussore
dinner-jacket. He was in very high spirits. Cocktails were brought and we
stood around the fireplace. There was a pause. 'I am sorry we were a little
late,' said the Duke, 'but Her Royal Highness couldn't drag herself away'.
He had said it. Her (gasp) Royal (shudder) Highness (and not one eye dared
to meet another).'
Vita's letters are the more domestic and intimate, sometimes terrifying in
their depth of insight. Henry Green used to say that people lie like
troopers when they are in love, and that statements made in letters on this
subject should be treated with great caution. Some of Vita's to Harold in
Paris, while he was attending the signing of Treaty of Versailles as part of
the British delegation, during the height of the Violet crisis, are a case
in point. Cleverly Vita keeps him in play while confessing the overwhelming
strength of her passion for Violet; but she is careful not to burn
completely the boats of the marriage.
Having survived that crisis, none of Vita's subsequent affairs with people
like Hilda Matheson, producer of Talks at the BBC, seriously threatened
their harmonious and usually contented existence. Their strange union now
grew in strength and mutual supportiveness and lasted until Harold's death
in 1962. Apart from affection and respect on both sides, feelings we watch
turning at the end into genuine love, what seems to have kept it going more
than anything was the enforced separation. Rarely could Vita be persuaded to
move from her beloved territory in Kent, the writing-room, the restored
castle, the gardens, the surrounding village.
By contrast, Harold, even after he had given up diplomacy was always on the
wing, either to attend the House of Commons as an MP, or to go to some grand
reception, or to pursue his research on a biography, as during the long
period he spent with the Lindberghs in America, preparing to write the life
of Mrs Lindbergh's father, Dwight Morrow. So often apart, Harold and Vita
grew ever closer together through the bond formed by this correspondence.
Although it was not a marriage that most couples would want to emulate, they
showed that, in certain rather special circumstances, it is possible to have
your cake and eat it.

COTE D'AZUR: INVENTING THE FRENCH RIVIERA
by Mary Blume
Thames &amp; Hudson Pounds 14.95, 208 pages
'A SUNNY Place for Shady People' was Somerset Maugham's definition of the
French Riviera. When Vita Sackville-West, dressed as a man, eloped there
with Violet Trefusis, she said her lover was the Mediterranean, while her
husband, Harold Nicholson, was Kent. For nearly two centuries British
travellers have fled our claustrophobic, cold, repressed island to invent
glamorous new lives for themselves in the south. What sparked this love
affair, and why does it continue today?
Mary Blume's book is a cultural snapshot with an unusual focus on mainstream
social history. Fast trains, free love, a new middle class and changing
medical opinion all played their part in the Cote d'Azur myth. When Smollett
visited Nice in 1763, his journey took 15 days and cost Pounds 120. It did
not deter bronchitic Britons, who settled in droves in the early 19th
century and paid the local jobless to build the Promenade des Anglais, as
much to pre-empt revolutionary unrest as to accommodate the English habit of
walking by the sea.
From 1860, Nice was Europe's fastest growing city and the first based on a
tourist economy. Cannes' star rose later, after Lord Brougham was detained
there in quarantine and built an Italianate villa to pass the time. But in
1850 Monaco was still the poorest state in Europe when Francois Blanc, of
the casino in Bad Homburg, set up his gambling chips, with the Pope as a
major stockholder.
It was all too reckless and French and naughty for the English, who formed a
society for the abolition of Monte Carlo Casino. But gambling, says Ms
Blume, epitomised the desire for timeless escape that enticed foreigners to
the Mediterranean. 'What does one come to Monte Carlo for, if not to lose?'
asked La Belle Orfeo, courtesan-lover of Edward VII and Czar Nicholas II,
when she died destitute after her gambling sprees. Cannes immortalised her
with the twin cupolas of the Carlton Hotel, said to be modelled on her
breasts.
Mary Blumes's history hovers between the academic approach of, say, John
Pemble's The Mediterranean Passion and a gossipy travelogue closer in style
to Peter Mayle. Pemble stopped at the Edwardian travellers; Blume continues
with the story of the Train Bleu and the 1920s sun worshippers who initiated
the first summer seasons - the aristocracy had always avoided high summer.
The Blue Train, its interconnecting cabins scandalously inviting midnight
liaisons on the way south, was known as the train of paradise. It made the
Riviera more accessible and popular and inspired the Diaghilev Ballet, while
its bright young passengers inspired Fitzgerald's characters Dick and Nicole
Driver. 'Do you like it here?' they are asked in the Riviera in Tender is
the Night. 'They have to,' a friend replies. 'They invented it.' In the same
way, Mary Blume's hybrid of a book sustains the myth it analyses with
elegance and verve.

FT  13 JUN 92 / Sport: The magic of Monterey Bay - Golf
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN HOPKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JOHN Steinbeck never knew much about golf. As far as we know he did not play
 -unlike John Updike, who seems to do little else these days. On the other
hand, Steinbeck was plus-four at writing. He was born in California and used
his home state as a setting for books. In Travels With Charley, for
instance, there is a passage in which he climbs to a peak overlooking
Monterey Bay and remarks to his companion: 'In the spring, Charley, when the
valley is carpeted with blue lupins like a flowery sea, there's the smell of
heaven up here . . .'
Next week the best players in the world will gather at Pebble Beach golf
club on the Monterey Peninsula, three hours' drive south of San Francisco,
to compete in the 92nd US Open. They could be forgiven for not keeping their
eye on the ball, for no US Open course can match Pebble Beach in splendour
of setting.
Robert Louis Stevenson is said to have described the Monterey Peninsula 'as
the greatest confluence of land and water in the world.' Go and stand on the
seventh tee at Pebble Beach and you will see what Stevenson meant. To your
left is the chocolate-box town of Carmel where Clint Eastwood was once mayor
and still owns a restaurant. Drinking tea, wearing tweeds, sitting by open
log fires and going for walks are what people do in Carmel.
To your right is Cypress Point, the course which, to my thinking, comes
nearest to being the one in the whole world I could happily play for the
rest of my life. As you stand in this privileged position, you see beneath
you sea lions on the rocks, weaving their fat brown necks from side to side
and croaking so loudly it is hard to concentrate on your tee shot.
At little more than 100 yards, the hole is easy on a calm day but as calm
days come along in these parts as often as a hole in one, you had better be
prepared for anything. 'Depending on the wind, it can be anything from a
wedge to a two-iron,' says Jack Nicklaus. He, more than anyone, should know.
Nicklaus and Pebble Beach are locked together in a grip as unremitting as
Nicklaus's own. He won the US Amateur there in 1961 and the US Open on the
same course in 1972.
In 1982, Nicklaus stood by the side of the 18th green waiting to see whether
Tom Watson, at that moment on the 17th tee, could birdie one of the last two
holes to tie with him for the US Open. Moments later Watson chipped in to
the hole from the thick grass that lapped the edge of the green. It was a
stroke of genius, one that he probably could not repeat if he had hit
another 1,000 balls, he said. Buoyed by this success, Watson birdied the
18th as well and defeated Nicklaus by two strokes.
Next week's will be only the third US Open ever held at Pebble Beach. When
it first moved there, someone wrote, it was like the US Supreme Court
turning up in Marrakesh. The US Open was 42 years old before it went further
west than Minneapolis and 45 before it crossed the Mason-Dixon line. It was
48 before it moved to California, to Riviera golf club in Los Angeles.
It is not that California does not have enough good golf courses, but rather
that the conservatives of the US Golf Association took some persuading of
the merit of California. Once they saw what was out there and realised that
Pebble Beach was not just a pretty patsy of a golf course - it is almost as
difficult as it is beautiful - they could not move fast enough.
The course was designed by Jack Neville, a crack amateur golfer, on land
bought by Samuel Morse at the time of the first world war. It had then, as
it has today, eight holes on cliffs overlooking Carmel Bay and 10 that wind
this way and that. It measures a shade under 7,000 yards. It is a beautiful
course which reaches its conclusion with a flourish, a par-five curving like
a scimitar along the bay. Gary Player once took an eight at this hole, and
Fred Couples a nine.
If previous Opens at Pebble Beach are any guide, we are in for a treat next
week. I hope so. John Steinbeck would be pleased.

FT  13 JUN 92 / Sport: Two speedsters with very different pedigrees -
Motoring
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STUART MARSHALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THEY WERE fast, compact and made in Germany but, apart from being hugely
enjoyable to drive, that was all they had in common.
The Ford Escort RS Cosworth is what aerospace people would call the ultimate
stretch of a basic machine. The Porsche 968 is the latest model from a small
company that once had a booming business making costly, top-quality sports
cars for motoring connoisseurs.
The Escort RS Cosworth came about because Ford is determined to win the
world rally championship. The rules for rallying's group A say 5,000 units
(2,500 from 1993) must be built in a year before a car can be approved for
competition use.
In essence, it is the complete four-wheel drive power train of a Sierra RS
Cosworth - itself a formidable motor sport machine - shoehorned into an
Escort body shell. Its two-litre, four-cylinder, 16-valve engine develops
227 horsepower. Driven brutally, the Escort leaps from 0-60 mph (0-96 kmh)
in 5.7 seconds - a Ferrari Testarossa takes 5.8 - and has a 140 mph (225
kmh) maximum. All of which is likely to be of academic interest to business
motorists who persuade their employers or partners to let them have one.
What the UK insurance companies have to say about this hottest of all
hatchbacks will depend on the driver's record and where it is to be kept.
Almost inevitably, it will be in Group 20, the highest of all. Even a
saintly member of the Institute of Advanced Motorists, with a life-long
no-claims bonus and a lock-up garage, will pay a hefty premium. The insurers
will decide each case individually. Ford has fitted it with a double-lock
security system and an engine immobiliser - and, yes, a police version is
already under development.
As everyday transport the Escort RS is pleasanter than you might think
possible. Before getting behind the wheel, I had eyed the bonnet top vents,
the all-too-obvious aerodynamic aids and ultra-squat tyres suspiciously.
Within 10 minutes, I had been charmed. Forget the aggressive looks. When
developing the car, Ford's special vehicle engineering department at Dunton,
Essex, ensured it would be easy and rewarding for normal people to drive.
Used responsibly, its slingshot acceleration makes overtaking - especially
on slippery roads - quick and safe. Steering response is instant and power
assistance ensures parking is effortless. The Escort RS glues itself to a
winding road and storms up sinuous hills. But it does not fidget or ride
uncomfortably at the sort of speeds possible only on an autobahn (although
not, I fear, for much longer). The gearshift is good and the clutch is not a
muscle-builder.
A lot of the credit for the Escort RS's civilised demeanour belongs to the
Pirelli P Zero Corsa size 225/45ZR16 tyres. They are as squat as the last
generation of Formula 1 racing tyres and safe for continuous use at more
than the car's maximum speed.
Normally, a very high performance tyre with a cross-section more than twice
as wide as high creates lots of road roar and thumping. Pirelli has managed
to make the Escort RS's specially developed P Zero Corsas ride with the
noise and comfort levels of a tyre three sizes smaller.
Standard and Motorsport versions of the Escort RS are Pounds 21,380. A
luxury model which costs Pounds 23,495 (Pounds 23,976 with hide trim) can
have a CD player and heated front seats as extras. Firm orders with deposits
have been given for 500 of the 700 Escort RS's to be sold in Britain this
year. Let us hope they can all get insurance.
The most remarkable things about the Porsche 968s are their prices, starting
at Pounds 34,945 for a hardtop coupe with six-speed gearbox. A cabriolet
with power hood is Pounds 38,724.
Had the 968 been introduced two years ago, prices probably would have been
10-15 per cent higher. But Porsche sales have been hit hard by the
recession. More realistic pricing is seen as one of the ways back to
prosperity.
Porsche's unique Tiptronic transmission adds another Pounds 2,152. It can be
used as a four-speed automatic or a manual gearbox with instant, clutch-less
changes. I reckon it would be worth every penny to an owner who commutes to
town during rush hour but likes to shift for himself on the truly open road.
Although the 968 clearly is derived from the 944, which was run out at cut
prices earlier this year, 82 per cent of its components are said to be new.
The engine is three litres with four cylinders. That makes it sound like
something from a truck. In fact, it is very smooth when spinning freely (it
has contra-rotating balance shafts) and produces more torque, or pulling
power at a given speed than any other naturally aspirated three-litre
engine.
When first I drove an open 968 cabriolet in Germany a year ago, I thought it
felt like being in a low-flying Tiger Moth, but quieter and much faster. In
sunny Berkshire a few days ago, I had to be more circumspect. But even at
speeds which do not put licences at risk, Porsche quality shines through.
The power-assisted steering is razor sharp. Reserves of roadholding and
handling are too great to be explored on public roads. The ABS brakes are
reassuringly powerful. Porsche claims top speeds of 156 mph (251 kph) for
the manual car, which has quite close ratios in its silky gearbox, and 153
mph (246 kph) for the Tiptronic.
An Escort RS would beat both to 60 mph (96 kmh) from a standing start - the
manual by nearly one second, the Tiptronic by just over two seconds. Does
that matter? I doubt it. Porsche buyers are no longer the city wide boys of
the loadsamoney days.
Porsche is only too aware of the temptations in the path of posh sports car
buyers. Competition includes the twin-turbo V6 Nissan 300ZX (Pounds 30,962)
and rotary engined Mazda RX-7 (Pounds 22,202). The arrival of the Mitsubishi
3000GT in Britain in August (mainland Europe in September) will not help.
Acquiring a Porsche always was more than just buying a new car. It still has
connotations of paying the entry fee into a club that is not open to drivers
of Nissans, Mazdas and Mitsubishis - or Escort RS Cosworths, for that
matter.
The UK is an important market to Porsche. The 968 - also with a group 20
insurance rating - is priced keenly by Porsche standards. It is expected
first to hold the fort and then to rebuild sales. It will be followed by a
relatively cheap (around Pounds 23,000 to Pounds 25,000 at today's values)
sports car, but this is still several years off.

FT  13 JUN 92 / Sport: Alone on the ocean: the steeliness of the
long-distance sailor - Sailing / Keith Wheatley on two very different men
who are racing across the Atlantic
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEITH WHEATLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TWELVE years ago Florence Arthaud was a freak. An exotically beautiful
Frenchwoman, barely 21, competing in the solo transatlantic race. This was
supposed to be the preserve of eccentric men with beards, backed by
formidable war records. But time passes, and Florence, 35, is favourite to
win the 1992 race at the helm of her blue-hulled trimaran Pierre 1er.
The race started last Sunday. Wednesday's news that Philippe Poupon, current
race record-holder with a Plymouth-Newport time of 10 days 9 hour, was
retiring with boat damage leaves the field clear for Arthaud. She is
presently gambling on being the most southerly of the leading multihulls. If
the Atlantic headwinds back, that is swing to the south, a good each-way bet
in midsummer, Pierre 1er could be in Newport by Wednesday.
Boat technology has changed almost unimaginably since Sir Francis Chichester
won in 40 days aboard the traditional sloop Gypsy Moth III, but the inner
steel of sailors willing to drive almost without sleep or food towards a
personal victory is a constant.
Although the circus of media and minders surrounding Arthaud would baffle
Sir Francis, you could put them on deck together and kindred spirits would
emerge. This race has always acted as a magnet for mariners with a gleam in
the eye - not to say a bee in the bonnet.
Whose passion could run greater than Viktor Yasykov's, the first Russian
ever to enter the race? Ever-smiling and almost unnaturally blonde for a man
in his forties, Yasykov is a Red Army veteran who was ordered into Chernobyl
to spend six months as a nuclear bin-man. Radiation sickness still afflicts
him from time to time.
Yasykov's self-designed and built 29ft boat Laguna took him three years to
construct in his home town of Sochi, between Georgia and the Ukraine, on the
Black Sea. Viktor's wife Ludmilla helped him sail it to Plymouth.
Inside Laguna the chestnut planking, fastened with copper rivets, glistens
in the light from an oil lamp. The craftsmanship would do credit to any yard
in the world. Viktor cast the lead for the keel himself, fashioning the mast
and boom from plain alloy tube.
In halting but eager English he talks of reading about the single-handed
race in Russia's first sailing magazine.
'It became my dream to build a yacht and take part in this,' he explained.
From thought to deed was nearly 15 years. In between, the Fasizi entry in
the 1989-90 Whitbread race came into his life. Viktor sailed two legs and
the tragic skipper Alexei Gryshenko, who became so overwhelmed by pressure
that he hanged himself in a Uruguayan wood, was his closest friend.
'My electronic log was built by Alexei. It reminds me,' explains the skipper
proudly, pointing to a crude device that looks as if it came from an O-level
physics project.
In between preparing for six weeks alone at sea Alexei is fighting a battle
with blinkered US immigration authorities who have declined to grant
Ludmilla a visa to see him finish in Newport, Rhode Island. He has the
passive confidence of a man who can hew and saw chestnut trees and build his
own ark.
From those with nothing, to those who appear to have everything, for the
Atlantic encompasses them all. Nigel Burgess sells yachts for a living: the
kind that have funnels, helicopters on the after-deck and cost Donald Trump
Dollars 30m. Monaco-based Burgess, 47, has sold the Trump vessel three
times. The quiet, bespectacled Englishman is arguably the most successful
broker in his field.
Burgess's idea of a holiday, however, is to race his spartan, ferociously
fast monohull Dogwatch II across the Atlantic, preferably ahead of the
opposition.
'If you want the ultimate sailing, this is pretty close. These boats are
extremely fast yet relatively easy to manage,' said Burgess, whose office
overlooks the first corner of the Monte Carlo grand prix circuit.
In its first incarnation as Charente Maritime, the water- ballasted yacht
came close to winning the Golden Globe solo round-the-world race. Unlike his
French rivals Burgess has no sponsor - except his own company with the name
painted discreetly on the stern.
'Someone came up to me the other day and said 'How did you get those flash
boys to sponsor you?',' laughed Burgess. 'They couldn't connect this scruffy
fellow, with holes in a old jersey, with Monaco and all that high-life
stuff.'
He did his first solo transatlantic race in 1968 when he was a 23-year-old
junior officer in the merchant navy. He left after a decade, with a master's
ticket. Burgess seeks contrasts when he goes to sea for fun. His
professional life is all big ships, big deals.
'Sailing a boat this complex and powerful is a whole different game. You
daren't sleep when you're close to the coast because you're going so fast,'
he says. 'None of my boats have ever had engines. I'm not mechanically
minded.'
One of the other competitors remarked recently that this race, held every
four years under the auspices of the Royal Western Yacht Club, 'is the last
remaining mythical sailing event where amateurs are not regarded as strange
creatures.'
But isn't Burgess kidding himself that even an affluent amateur can take on
the fully-sponsored French and Italian entries whose skippers sail full-time
for a living? Back in France, Philippe Poupon and Florence Arthaud have the
profile of a marine Nigel Mansell.
'I realise that they're fitter and in many ways better prepared than a
sedentary middle-aged man who usually goes to work in a suit but they have
their problems,' said Burgess.
'There is no better motivation than a passion. I'm not doing this as just
another race on the circuit. And an average sponsor's pocket is no more open
than my own.'

FT  13 JUN 92 / Sport: Conceived on a rainy day in Birmingham - Cricket /
The England Amateurs tell Teresa McLean that they are no Gentlemen
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERESA MCLEAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE inspiration came during a rainy afternoon at Edgbaston. Not one of the
Test Match wash-outs we have just had there, but four years ago.
Frank Elliott was watching the rain and talking to some friends about the
hardships of English cricket. Out of the blue, or strictly speaking out of
the drizzling grey, he had the idea that they should found an English
amateur team. His friends agreed and, he said with a shrug: 'Things got
going.'
Things connected with the English Amateur XI are blessed with insouciance,
as one might hope of a side that does not play cricket for money. But they
also show a strong sense of realism, as one might expect of a side conceived
on a dismal day at Edgbaston and kept alive in the face of powerful
professional pressures.
The English Amateur XI are not the country's amateurs of old, the Gentlemen
who played an annual game against the Players, professional cricketers, from
1806 until 1962, when the distinction between Gentlemen and Players was
deemed out of date and undesirable. The new Amateurs do not want to be the
new Gentlemen. 'We're not like that at all. We wouldn't like to be. There is
no class or anything of that sort in our game. Our purpose is to give people
a chance to play cricket for their country.'
The Amateurs' manager, Terry Bates, speaks with weary passion, with the
voice of one who is used to not being taken seriously. He knew his team
would lose their recent match against Pakistan, as indeed they did, by an
innings and 16 runs. But he also knew that the game was the team's greatest
honour in the three years it has been playing. The players knew it too. To a
man they declared themselves thrilled to have been chosen to play against
the tourists, whatever the result.
One of them, a slender Australian called Paul Roshier, with pale skin
carpeted in black hair, only reflected for a fleeting moment before telling
me that the best memory of his cricketing life was getting the wicket of
Inzamam-ul-Haq the day before. By then, Inzamam had made 102 out of the
Pakistanis' opulent first day total of 332 for 3 declared.
Roshier is a fine cricketer. A few years ago he was on the verge of a career
in professional cricket and a place in the Australian Test team. Yet he
chose as his pride and joy this one wicket, taken in a two-day game in
Luton, in muggy weather, in front of a crowd consisting almost entirely of
Pakistanis tirelessly chanting and invading the pitch, as their heroes
swanned along towards victory.
Why? As an Amateur he plays for pleasure. And, all games at this high level,
however one-sided, are exhilarating. Inzamam is a spectacular scalp, even in
Luton. This is the first year the Amateurs have secured a fixture in the
tourists' hectic schedule and doubtless they will ensure it is a regular
fixture. It puts them up a rank. The Pakistanis did not play patronisingly.
Free of strain, they seemed to welcome the opportunity to try out Waqar
Younis nice and gently before the Test matches started.
Waqar took a wicket with his first ball on the second day, keeping the
Amateurs' fatal first innings collapse going, from 117 for 0 to 174 all out.
That style of scoring suits the Amateurs. One feature they have inherited
from the Gentlemen is the swashbuckling tendency to produce one or two stars
in each game, but they lack the cohesion to give them winning support. They
do not make a thorough team because they do not have the time to be
thorough. Practice time, like playing time, has to be taken out of the
players' annual leave from work. They are impressive, experienced cricketers
whose only training time together each year is a long week-end in
Lilleshall.
Almost all the Amateurs play for Minor Counties, County Associations or
County Leagues. Steve Dean (Staffordshire) and Malcolm Roberts
(Buckinghamshire and the Surrey League), who opened the batting at Luton
with 80 and 45 respectively, are good examples. Several Amateurs could have
been professional cricketers but chose not to be, for personal, family or
job reasons. Mel, brother of Nasser Hussain, of Essex and England, and Neil,
brother of Bruce French, the Nottinghamshire and England wicket keeper, are
among a number who have cricket in the family.
When you meet the Amateurs, one of the most powerful impressions you get is
that you are meeting the members of a small, cricketing brotherhood. It is
an exceptionally friendly one, only too happy to share its story.
Although team spirit has to look after itself, a vivid sense of identity is
an Amateur speciality, even with only a short, erratic fixture list like
this season's: the big game at Luton then, more than six weeks later, two
away games in two days against Ireland, then two weeks later two away games
in two days against Scotland.
Next year the National Cricket Association, which gives the Amateurs the
money, facilities and coaching they need to survive, is expanding this home
international circuit to include Wales and giving it a proper title: The
Triple Crown. Possibly, just possibly, another year or two may see the
Amateurs taking on the Dutch, the Danes or any other talented Europeans.
The players prefer not to look further ahead than the end of whatever game
they are playing. Nick Folland, their captain, put it neatly: 'One at a time
is plenty.'
He looks like a magazine advert for a cricketer: tall, sunburnt and healthy,
born to wear whites. He is a teacher at Blundell's School in Devon where,
officially, he teaches geography but, unofficially, helps with cricket. A
school with a proud cricketing tradition, Blundell's is generous with the
amount of time it gives him to play.
In return, Folland speaks enthusiastically of the school, is a
distinguished, enterprising captain of Devon and, when he gets a chance to
play for England, as on the fading grass of inner Luton, bats with aplomb.
In the second innings, seeing Waqar loosening up and the Amateur wickets
falling apace, he knew there was no point holding back and scored an
increasingly cavalier 76. It included an almost straight six, which landed
next to the small, wooden pavilion where his team-mates sat on the grass,
awaiting defeat, cheering his innings.
When he was out, caught behind, Folland walked without waiting for the
umpire's decision.

FT  13 JUN 92 / The poisoning scandal that haunts Japan: Hundreds are still
seeking damages for the Minamata mercury disaster 36 years after the first
deaths
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEFAN WAGSTYL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SABURO Hashiguchi, a retired fisherman, sighs bitterly. 'How long must we
wait? We will die and our children and grandchildren will have to take up
our case.' He is talking about his fight to be compensated for Japan's worst
outbreak of industrial pollution. His fingers shake uncontrollably, evidence
of the damage done to his body by mercury poisoning.
Hashiguchi is one of hundreds of Japanese still seeking compensation in a
case dating from 1956. The fishermen of Minamata, a seaside town in southern
Japan, were poisoned when they ate fish tainted by toxic mercury dumped into
the sea from a plant owned by Chisso, one of the country's biggest chemical
companies. The world was shocked in 1972 when a delegation from Minamata
went to the first United Nations environment conference, in Stockholm, with
photographs of how the worst-affected victims looked. Their deformed bodies
were portrayed widely as the price Japan paid for its economic miracle.
Now, 23 years after the first court claim was filed and 36 years after the
first deaths, the people of Minamata are still waiting for their claims to
be settled. To the embarrassment of the Japanese government, other victims
attended the UN's latest conference on the environment, in Rio de Janeiro,
to re-state their case.
The heaviest responsibility for the tragedy lies with Chisso. Not only did
its plant pour untreated mercury sludge into Minamata bay - it also ignored
warning signs and covered-up evidence for 15 years. The injustice was
compounded by years of obstruction by the central government - even now, it
refuses to admit that it shares any responsibility with Chisso - and local
authorities in the Minamata region. The courts also failed to reach an
acceptable settlement.
The victims - there are 13 separate support groups - contributed to their
own misfortunes, splitting into competing factions and allowing themselves
to be hijacked by political interests, including the Japan Communist party
(although these quarrels were the natural product of years of frustration).
The splits have arisen over differences of strategy, dating from the 1960s
when half the victims opted for court action and the others for negotiation.
At one stage,Chisso fostered dissent by favouring some victims over others,
wining and dining them in Tokyo and handing out souvenirs.
In the early post-war years, Minamata was a boom town. Its future seemed
assured by Chisso's investments and the company even got a seal of approval
from Emperor Hirohito, who visited the plant in 1951. But then, in the
mid-1950s, the first cases of what became known as Minamata disease began to
appear - patients lost control of their arms, legs, speech and eyesight.
Finally, scores died in great pain. Dr Hajime Hosokawa, Chisso's factory
doctor, suspected the mercury waste was responsible for the illness and
carried out experiments in 1959.
They proved his suspicions were well-founded. He sprinkled waste on cats'
food and found they lost control of their bodies, rather like the human
victims. But when he reported the results to his superiors, he was ordered
to stop the experiments, destroy the cats and stay silent. Chisso continued
to pump waste into the bay.
The authorities - including the powerful Ministry of International Trade and
Industry - also ignored a study carried out in 1957 at Kumamoto university
hospital, near Minamata, which discovered traces of mercury in dead victims'
brains. But officials did nothing, so great was the government's commitment
to pursuing high-speed economic growth and its ignorance of the
environmental dangers. The town council was reluctant to put pressure on
Chisso, Minamata's biggest employer. Politics clouded the dispute when some
of the victims turned for support to the Communist party. Only in 1968 did
the Ministry of Health and Welfare admit that mercury waste was the cause of
Minamata disease, and only then did Chisso stop pumping. By then, 100,000
people had eaten poisoned fish.
One group of victims launched a lawsuit against Chisso, while others stepped
up campaigns demanding negotiations with the company. The actions culminated
in violent demonstrations at Chisso's Tokyo headquarters. The company held
out, trying to minimise its responsibility. But much of its case was
destroyed, however, when Dr Hosokawa told court officials the truth about
the cat experiments as he lay dying in hospital in 1970.
Even then, the excruciating slowness of Japanese judicial procedures meant
that it was not until 1973 that the Kumamoto district court found Chisso
guilty of negligence and ordered it to pay damages of between Y16m-Y18m,
depending on the severity of victims' disabilities. The verdict was not the
end of the legal battles, though.
The court left it to a government-appointed panel of doctors to establish
the medical criteria under which compensation would be paid. Under these
rules, 3,000 people have been certified as victims. They include all the
most serious cases, including children who were poisoned before they were
born when their mothers ate tainted fish. Many of these foetal cases
suffered hideous congenital deformities. But a new dispute erupted when the
authorities, using the government doctors' criteria, started rejecting
claims from many people who thought they had been poisoned. To date, 12,000
patients have been turned down.
The rejections spurred more lawsuits. Some claimants sued Kumamoto
prefecture, successfully, for negligence in handling testing procedures;
this forced the authorities to accelerate the examinations. Early in the
1980s, other groups filed precedent-setting suits claiming damages from the
prefecture and the national government as well as Chisso. The suits accused
the authorities of being negligent in failing to monitor properly the water
quality in Minamata bay. The authorities retorted that, at the time of the
incident, the law did not require either the prefecture or the government to
carry out such checks. (Japan's tough anti-pollution laws were not passed
until the early 1970s).
The claimants won a major victory in 1987 when the Kumamoto district court
ruled that the authorities had indeed been negligent. But the joy proved
short-lived. The government and prefecture appealed to the high court in
Fukuoka, the biggest city in southern Japan; five years later, the case is
still under review.
Early this year, though, a judge hearing a parallel case in the Tokyo
district court ruled in favour of the government and prefecture - and
rejected claims of negligence. The victims' groups were furious because a
verdict given in Tokyo, even at district court level, has a powerful
psychological effect on judges elsewhere.
Judge Shinji Arai did, however, give two other key rulings. He awarded
damages of Y4m to 42 of the 64 claimants before him - even though none had
passed the official medical test procedures. This gave judicial support to
their long-held argument that the official tests were framed too tightly.
Arai also urged the government and the prefecture to settle out of court
since they bore 'political responsibility' for the incident. That remark was
aimed squarely at the Tokyo government.
Although he did not say so, Arai knew as he gave judgment that Kumamoto
prefecture was willing to talk peace with the victims. In 1990, the
prefecture, led by then governor Morihiro Hosokawa, had broken ranks with
the national authorities and started to seek a negotiated settlement.
Hosokawa, a maverick politician who has since resigned, says: 'What we did
was unbelievable for the (national) government. I had to go to Tokyo to
explain my decision personally.'
The nub of the argument is what to do about claimants who have some symptoms
of Minamata disease but fail to meet the official criteria. Ten years ago
they were dismissed as malingers by, among others, Yasushi Morishita, a
former leading official of the ruling Liberal Democratic party, who said:
'I, too, would like to live in Kumamoto prefecture and be certified as a
victim.' Today, public officials are more cautious; but the doubts remain
because symptoms, such as a loss of control over limbs, can be a sign of
other conditions.
Hosokawa says 8,000 more people could become eligible if the criteria were
extended. The people in this 'grey zone' could receive smaller payments than
the original minimum of Y16m - perhaps Y4m, as awarded by the Tokyo court.
The prefecture would agree to such a settlement. So, probably, would Chisso,
which would pay the lion's share. But the national government refuses to
agree, even though the money would not be described as 'compensation' but as
some form of ex-gratia payments.
The view of the Environment Agency, which is responsible for Minamata
although it was not founded until 1975, is that even taking part in talks
would be an admission of responsibility. 'The government cannot enforce laws
which did not exist in the 1950s,' says one official. But some senior
politicians would like to force the bureaucrats to make a settlement. One
former minister notes: 'We should say this was the responsibility of the
whole country since the whole country prospered from economic growth.' Such
suggestions horrify government officials, who fear a precedent might be set
for scores of other claims from the post-war years.
To be fair the government has, implicitly, accepted some moral
responsibility by guaranteeing the compensation payments being made by
Chisso. It has also poured public money into a Y485bn scheme to dredge the
contaminated sludge out of Minamata bay and build a waterfront memorial
park. But even with the best efforts from all sides, settlement of the last
claims remains far in the future. Hiroki Ouzumi, general manager of the
environmental department of Kumamoto prefecture, says: 'It will take five
years if the conciliation talks succeed and 10 years or more if they fail.'
While the lawyers argue, Minamata bleeds. Since the 1950s, the town's
population has fallen from 50,000 to 36,000. Young people leave to study and
do not come back. Fishing, which once employed a third of the work force,
virtually has ended. Employment at Chisso has dropped from 3,000 to 800; the
company keeps its factory open only because closing altogether would seem
like abandoning Minamata. While the rest of southern Japan enjoys an
investment boom, new companies shun Minamata.
The damage has penetrated deep into society. Tsuginori Hamamoto, another
disabled former fisherman, says that people making arranged marriages avoid
potential partners from victims' families. Youngsters going to live in
Kumamoto or elsewhere like to forget they ever came from Minamata. Amid such
gloom, it is hard to find hope there. The town council and the victims'
associations cannot even agree on sharing their records to establish a
Minamata disease museum. The fruit of 30 years of bitterness is yet more
bitterness.

FT  13 JUN 92 / Travel: Homage to a cleaner in Catalonia - Teresa McLean
enjoys the friendliness and unfailing good humour of the people in one of
Europe's untamed corners
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERESA MCLEAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
YOU have not lived until you have tried explaining to a Catalan cleaning
lady that a dog has defecated at the door of your hotel room. The woman
spoke neither English nor Spanish, only Catalan, which I do not speak. It
had to be body language. Encouraged by other members of the hotel staff, I
struggled to explain what was wrong. Eventually the cleaner dipped her mop
in her bucket and let it drip suggestively.
I started barking. My husband had long since taken refuge in a cafe and I
soon joined him. It was a great relief to find, on returning to our room
later, that the floor near the door had been scrubbed spotlessly clean.
This dog muck episode reflects the chief characteristics of the Catalans we
met: their cheerful kindness and helpfulness, alongside the enormous
difficulty we had in communicating with them. A few people speak a few words
of French or German; hardly anyone speaks English; many people speak, or at
least understand, both Catalan and Spanish (known as Castillian), but most
people we met took pride in sticking to Catalan.
It is unlike any other language I have heard, but apparently has Latin-based
roots in common with southern French, some Italian dialects and Romanian. If
you are rash enough to try pronouncing it, salvation lies in peoples'
unfailing good humour, which stops short of guffaws of laughter.
In our 17 days there, the nearest I can remember to a bad-tempered remark
was a lady in a bread shop asking us not to touch the loaves on the shelves.
Usually shops and markets were only too quick to hand out free samples of
anything they had. Bakers took particular pleasure in giving us free slices
of coca, a Catalan pastry-bread, the sweet variety often covered with
crystallised fruit, pine nuts and sugar.
Most coca is nice, but most Catalan food is not. I suspect Catalonia is one
of those places, like England, where you find better food in people's homes
than in restaurants. Apparently, you can enjoy superb fish cookery on the
coast, but we were inland.
Fine foods grow: olives, nuts, huge tomatoes, homicidal onions, honeydew
melons, plums, grapes, peaches (the staple Catalan fruit) and the great
provincial pride and joy - wild fungi, sold fresh in the short autumn
season, dried the rest of the year.
But these delights die in the cooking, ending up in dull, heavy meals. Lunch
is any time between 2.30-5pm, dinner any time between 9.30pm-midnight.
Children take a two-to-four-hour siesta and are still up and flourishing
after midnight, helping their parents chew their way through dry pork chops
and chips, chicken and chips or botifarra (a Catalan version of Cumberland
sausage) and chips. The lucky ones might get a squid fritter.
Breakfast is a movable feast and better than the others. Usually we got
coffee and croissants, while the sturdy natives drank lager and ate salami
sandwiches. Fatty food and smoking are two of the province's favourite
indulgences, with gallons of lager and iced rose to wash everything down. We
first got a taste of this after driving about 80 kms through a symphony of
stinks, from abattoirs, farmyards, sewers and God knows what else, on our
way from Barcelona airport to Vic, an old-fashioned town famous for its 35
churches and its old-fashioned, well-behaved girls.
Vic, like many Catalan towns, is ringed by a fiendish one-way system and we
only reached our hotel, late at night, by driving along the pavement, guided
by amiable citizens. The receptionist couldn't understand a word we said, so
he offered us a beer.
Above all else, Vic stands out for its Episcopal Museum, which is crammed
full of art treasures, ranging from stone-age carvings to medieval church
decorations and a mass of sculptures, paintings and manuscripts. This year
the museum is celebrating its centenary and though you cannot hope to fit
all its glories into one visit, it would be a crime not to try.
Catalonia's religious art is far more beautiful and varied than I had
expected, though the damage done by the civil war, even in the tiniest
places, was often catastrophic. Some religious buildings, however, escaped
unhurt. We walked round several sets of cloisters that had originally
belonged to medieval monasteries, the abbey churches now used as parish
churches and the cloisters still shady and quiet, with only the occasional
fountain and click of a visiting German camera to break the silence.
My favourite example of a medieval church still in religious use is the
Romanesque, secular cathedral in La Seu D'Urgell, an old town high in the
Pyrenees, near the French hardly altered over the centuries. It is tall,
slender, dark and hauntingly atmospheric, with a large present-day
congregation.
The cathedral is in the old, pedestrian quarter of town, which is a warren
of covered alleyways and buildings dating back seven centuries, even
boasting some ancient grain measures, used today as leaning posts. We were
lucky enough to be in one of Seu's old squares when it was showing off the
sardana, the Catalan national dance, one Sunday evening.
Every weekend the square fills with circles of people dancing the sardana,
arms on high, hands joined, stepping in rhythmic patterns. A town band
provides the music, playing woodwind, brass and an undercurrent of
percussion with robust enthusiasm, until the heat and thirst become too much
for them.
These are brave men. With the temperature well above 30'F, most men seem to
spend a fair bit of time sheltering in bars and playing cards, while women
work, cook or talk about men, and weather forecasters stick sun symbols all
over maps.
It is money for old rope, Spanish weather forecasting. Small wonder most men
have short hair, to stay cool. Alas, the same is not true of their shorts,
which hang in loud, loose folds round their knees, topped with bum-bags.
Most women have long hair before marriage, when a few of them take revenge
on the more comfortable sex by getting one of Catalonia's wealth of
hairdressers to cut their hair drastically short.
Both sexes, of all ages, spend leisurely hours sitting on benches, sizing up
the haircuts and all other visible features of people walking past while
their children charge around and trade in skate-boards. Being stared at is
one of the things you have to get used to if you go to Catalonia, or
anywhere else in Spain. It is part of Spanish life.
So is sitting in cafes. In a hot, humid month like August, one of the most
welcome things this lovely, languid pastime has to offer is iced mineral
water, available without 'gas' but generally assumed to be more desirable
the more gaseous it is. Bubbles fight the heat, which is formidable.
Spring must be the best time to visit Catalonia, when the weather is cooler
and the glorious countryside drenched in flowers. Even at the end of a
scorching summer, we saw flowers and herbs everywhere. There were
spectacular birds, including eagles, red and black kites, hawks, honey
buzzards and bee-eaters; spectacular dragonflies and butterflies - too many
and various to take in, flying off in thick clouds when disturbed.
But most of the rivers had dried up. The majestic River Segre was one of the
few still tumbling past us as we drove through the mountains and hills. The
trick with spectacular, dramatic, indeed occasionally unsurfaced and
hair-raising journeys such as these, far up in the wilds, is to head for
towns which the guidebook describes as quaint or left over from a former
glory.
It was not just sadly but with a sense of foreboding that we turned towards
Barcelona for the flight home. Somehow it felt frightening to leave such a
wild place, where little has changed since the mountains and forests were
formed, and go back to the tamed parts of Europe.

FT  13 JUN 92 / Travel: Ghana: do not rely on magic before 3am - Leslie
Downer reaches Accra ahead of the trampling crowd
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LESLIE DOWNER

<TEXT>
IN 1972 the Meridien was one of the most splendid hotels in Africa.
Straddling the Greenwich meridian, it was the tallest building in Ghana, so
high that people said it made them dizzy. When you stepped into the lobby
from the heat and dust outside, it was as icy as a fridge. There were
liveried bellboys, chandeliers, a fountain with four etiolated stone figures
in it and marble floors so polished you could slide across them.
Outside was a huge pool with a diving board and terraces with lawns and
trees, like an oasis from the tropical heat. Most decadent of all was the
casino, the Zero Room (the meridian is zero degrees of longitude). The hotel
is in Tema, at that time a spanking new port city, the Wanchai or the
Marseilles of Ghana, and the Zero Room was always packed with reckless
buccaneering types with money to spend - seamen, adventurers, international
travellers.
Tuxedoed croupiers with white gloves manned the roulette tables and fortunes
were won and lost. For schoolboys up from the bush it was an awe-inspiring
sight. One recalls how he timidly put a few pence into a fruit machine.
Bells started ringing, people gathered round, and money began tumbling out.
Finally the cashier came and counted all the coins and changed them into
notes. It came to more than Pounds 100.
Today you would never guess at the Meridien's splendid past. The
air-conditioning was turned off years ago, and shipping offices now occupy
the luxury suites. The floors are scratched and grimy, the lifts do not
work, the chandeliers have been ripped out and replaced with dangling light
bulbs and the pool is dry and crumbling. Plastic sheets cover the tables in
the Zero Room.
Ghana is a great place for intimations of mortality. It is full of crumbling
stucco, grand buildings gone to seed, deserted hotels where elegant young
men once propped up the bar, and fine straight roads pitted with potholes.
You can see the history of the past 20 years etched into the fabric of the
place.
It is a sad tale of extravagance, incompetent government and spectacular
corruption. Colonel Acheampong, the military ruler from 1972 to 1978, was
accused of having salted away Dollars 100m in Swiss bank accounts before
meeting his come-uppance, and things got so bad that when the rains didn't
come everyone said it was Acheampong's fault. 'I am not God,' he replied.
Since then there has been desperate hardship. As recently as 1988 there was
starvation and airlifts of food, though now the economy is improving at last
and there are goods in the shops again.
We arrived in Ghana at the height of the dry season, when red dust swirls
around and gets into your toes, eyes and hair. Accra, the capital, is a city
which has not sealed itself off from nature as successfully as most. The red
dust encroaches everywhere. Instead of pavements, you walk along the edge of
the road, on dusty rutted verges. There are palm trees and scrubby grass
between the squat buildings and rows of coconut palms edging the ocean.
Accra spreads for miles along wonderful silver beaches. You can sit at the
bar of the Riviera, another faded hotel with a dried-out pool, and watch the
Atlantic breakers, yet still be in the heart of the city. At night,
bullfrogs croak hoarsely from the stagnant drainage channels which line the
streets, and cicadas trill; in the morning you might be woken by cocks
crowing.
Besides its romantic seediness, the seductive thing about Ghana is that
almost no-one knows about it. In Accra the white faces belong to businessmen
and engineers, often British; in the port cities they belong to seamen, who
seem ill at ease at the sight of a white woman. Perhaps it is because, like
all port cities, there is a sizeable red-light district, and a white woman
reminds them too forcibly of their reproachful wives back home.
The most romantic of the port cities is Takoradi, a four-hour drive down a
mercifully unpitted road from Accra, through lush rainforest and groves of
coconut palms. Like everywhere in Ghana, it has seen better days. But it is
still a grand and leisurely town, with broad boulevards which lead past
tumbledown stuccoed buildings with shutters and parapets, up to the Harbour
View.
We sat here and had beer and pepper kebabs, while the seamen at the
neighbouring tables, each with his prostitute, avoided my eye. Boats tacked
back and forth and there was even a railway line - though, like everything
in Ghana, it is nothing but a memento of better times. People walk up and
down the line with bundles on their heads, and in all the time I was there I
never saw a train.
In the evening, like everyone else, we took a stroll along the main street.
Ghana is practically on the equator and the climate is like a perfect June
day all year round, with hot days and balmy nights. Life really begins at
dusk, when everyone emerges from the cool of their houses. People squat in
doorways, laze on doorsteps or parade up and down, laughing and talking.
The grand decaying buildings turn into a backdrop and tiny stalls spring up
in their shadows, lit by flickering yellow kerosene flames, the only
street-lighting there is. Between two decrepit stone lions a couple of women
swathed in brightly-coloured cloths were selling whole smoked fish, balanced
in intricate piles, and kenkei, steamed maize meal in bamboo leaves.
Other stalls offered rice, 'bush meat,' goat stew, plantain, tea (with
evaporated milk - there is no fresh milk in Ghana), ice-cream, cigarettes or
biscuits.
We had decided to take in a magic show at the Zenith Hotel. Outside, posters
proclaimed that the world-famous Professor De-ago would kill his wife Nana
Ama, cut open her stomach, pull out her intestines, eat them, and then bring
her back to life.
This had to be seen. We paid our 300 cedis (about 50p) and went in. The
'hotel' turned out to be a theatre, with a balcony and a huge stage. Once
our eyes got used to the darkness we saw that there were only hard school
benches to sit on, and the stage was lit by two lightbulbs swinging from a
cord. By midnight, nothing had happened. Magic, apparently, never begins
until at least 3am. We finally gave up and went to bed.
For all its mood of grand decay, things are definitely looking up in Ghana.
Foreign investors are returning and in the last couple of years several
luxury hotels have opened, even more splendid than the Meridien used to be.
Last August saw the opening of Ghana's first five-star hotel, the Labadi
Beach, in Accra. Stepping in from the hot dusty road outside is a positively
surreal experience. The vaulted lobby, of Ghanaian timber, is as icy as a
fridge. Outside a fountain plays, surrounded by lawns and flower-beds, as
green and lush as an oasis. The only thing missing is a casino.
Ghana is gearing itself to welcome tourists, though for adventurous
travellers now is the time to go. Four airlines fly to Ghana from the UK:
BA, KLM, Swissair and Ghana Airways. The fare is about Pounds 1,112 for a
one-month return (PEX up to 25 days: Pounds 919), or a little over Pounds
500 through a bucket shop.
Accommodation: There are hotels to suit every taste and pocket in Accra.
Kyn's Hotel in Osu has air-conditioned doubles for about Pounds 13 a night;
the Sunrise has smarter rooms and a pool for about Pounds 30; the Labadi
Beach offers luxury and the best beach in town for Dollars 180. In Takoradi
the best hotel is the Ahenfe, with doubles about Pounds 11.50 a night.
Maps and guidebooks: There is an excellent map put out by KLM and Shell
(Pounds 7.95). Lonely Planet's West Africa: A Travel Survival Kit, (Pounds
7.95) has useful information. If you can get it, Ghana, A Travel Guide,
published by the Ghana Tourist Board, is much more detailed and less
opinionated.

FT  13 JUN 92 / Drink: Simply the apple of their eye - Giles MacDonogh
visits the Pays d'Auge to sample Calvados, the Norman apple brandy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILES MACDONOGH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT MAY have taken a while for the idea to sink in, but I think that even the
slowest among us has realised that wine is made from hundreds of different
grapes and that the grape type has a determining effect on flavour.
The same applies to apples and cider, and indeed, calvados or Norman apple
brandy. Ask a calvados producer what apples he uses and you will begin to
wish you had not. There are as many as 600 different kinds, and a great many
more must have become extinct over the past century.
A traditionalist such as Claude Camut, in La Lande-Saint Leger in Calvados'
best region, the Pays d'Auge, has about 25 different sorts of apple growing
on his 35 hectares (85 acres). The rather more modernist Domaine L. Dupont
in Victot-Pontfol still has 10 different sorts scattered over 27 hectares
(65 acres).
The favourites vary from property to property: Camut has at least a third of
his land planted with Bisquet, but he is increasingly impressed by the Dutch
Belle de Boskop. A single variety, however, would simply not do: real
calvados is a blend of early ripening, mid-season ripening and late-ripening
sorts; the clues to many of these lie in their names. For example a Saint
Martin apple ripens in November; a Noel des Champs in December.
The two schools of thought in Calvados are less divided about the
multiplicity of apples going into the vats than they are about three other
burning issues: the use of dwarf trees in rows to increase yields; the age
of the cider to be distilled; and the use of new oak casks to give
supplementary flavours to spirits marketed young.
For Claude Camut the quality of the apples from the old, high-branched trees
is marginally better. He agrees, however, that the yields are dramatically
lower: about one third as much. The new trees also take only five years to
reach maturity as against 15 for a traditionally grown tree.
With incentives like these few growers now plant the old-style orchards
which were considerably more attractive than the new uniform rows. In old
orchards the Normandy cows also played their part: 'My cows prune the
trees,' says Camut.
Camut is also at the extreme right of the dispute over what age of cider to
distill. He waits two years until the cider has 'settled.'
Others, such as Christian Drouin, a former marketing teacher turned
distiller in Coudray-Rabut, insist that the habit of distilling old cider
was borne simply of the necessity of getting rid of last year's left-overs
before you fermented the new season's apples. You handed over the old, flat
cider to a peripatetic distiller and made some nice fresh stuff.
Etienne Dupont agrees with him: old cider makes for fiery calvados. Perhaps
Camut does not worry about this because he has such large stocks already
mellowed by time.
Numerous pre-war vintages lie in cask in his cellars and, in his opinion,
his range does not really start in earnest until you reach the 40 year old.
Etienne Dupont is a former banker who has clearly weighed up the whole
question with a shrewd financier's mind. Both he and Christian Drouin want
to make calvados which will be ready younger.
Both use some new oak casks to give the spirit a kick start. Drouin ages
some of his calvados in secondhand port and amontillado sherry casks. This
naturally adds to the colour of the spirit and gives a fruity roundness to
the calvados.
All three estates make high quality hand-made spirits which are a
considerable step up from the industrial production of big companies such as
Pere Magliore and Boulard. Camut's calvados begins to taste increasingly of
licorice as it gets older; it loses the baked-apple flavour of the younger
spirits and becomes increasingly abstract.
Drouin's vintages, such as 1967, 1968 and 1969, are far softer, occasionally
giving off a whiff of honey and bananas. Of the new school producers I
slightly preferred Dupont, whose ten-year-old has a smoky character
(probably from the wood) and whose older spirits have a little note of fresh
crushed almonds.
A fourth producer I visited was the Swiss Herr Affentranger at the Chateau
du Breuil at Le Breuil-en-Auge. The calvados from Chateau du Breuil used to
be one of the best known in France when it was the property of the Bizouard
family; recognisable on every drinks trolley by the distinctive,
clapper-shape of its bottles. Du Breuil's calvados is perhaps the least
appley of the lot, with a very dry style. The Royal even has a slight rustic
note, so that one has no trouble conjuring up an image of a Normandy cow
munching windfalls in the orchard.
Information: Camut calvados is imported by Windrush Wines of Cirencester,
tel: 0285-67121.
Drouin is imported by Michael Druitt, tel: 071-493-5412.
L. Dupont is imported by Eau de Vie, tel: 071-724-5009. Stockists in London
include: Harrods; Lea &amp; Sandeman, Fulham Road; Bloomsbury Wine and Spirits,
Bloomsbury Street.
Chateau du Breuil is not yet imported into the UK.

FT  13 JUN 92 / Drink: Aussies stir the French - Jancis Robinson visits
Languedoc's most expensive hole in the ground
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANCIS ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
I AM hurtling round a roundabout on the outskirts of Narbonne one morning in
James Herrick's Alfa Romeo when his car phone bleeps. 'Allo? g'day, mate,
what are you doing up so late?' (Pause.) 'What are the Baumes at? Good.
Great stuff. You'd better go and get some sleep.'
One business partner reporting on the ripeness of some jointly owned
vineyard to another, except that Robert Hesketh was speaking from south
Australia while Herrick was driving me towards their new winery in the
Languedoc.
La Motte is an old vin ordinaire farm on canalside flatlands just north of
Narbonne. No self-respecting Frenchman would dream of trying to produce
world-class wine there; it is outside any of France's zealously-guarded
zones for Appellation Controlee wines.
But, as I reported in the Weekend FT early in 1990, Global Vineyards' policy
is to apply the snazzy techniques and unfettered philosophy of the New World
to the relatively cheap vineyard land of southern France. I thought it would
be interesting to spend a day with Herrick this spring, as the first of
their 175 hectares (385 acres) of French Chardonnay were just starting to
bear fruit, and I was right.
The Australians moved in by stealth over Christmas 1989, but now the
Languedoc is abuzz with rumour and fact concerning outside investment.
Chateau Ricardelle, a prominent property just south of Narbonne, is now
being revitalised by a Swiss-Italian group.
Peter Sichel and Bernadette Villars are just two of the Bordeaux proprietors
who have already bought in Corbieres (AC, of course) and a Belgo-Bordeaux
group has moved into La Clape. On the way to Narbonne, Herrick had pointed
out another rather handsome Corbieres property, which apparently would have
been snapped up by another Bordelais if it had not been for the financial
depredations of the past year's frosts.
We arrived at La Motte to a vineyard quite unlike its unkempt neighbours,
with their gnarled little straggly vine bushes dotting the bare earth. Here
were carefully manicured rows of Chardonnay vines three grassy metres apart,
the juicy leaves sprouting obediently and exclusively along shoulder height
wires, machine-tightened between posts that looked like cabers, unlike
anything I had seen in any other French vineyard.
'It's a system of moveable trellis wires designed to produce eight tonnes
per acre, but here we're not allowed to make more than five,' Herrick
explained in the tone of indulgent exasperation he uses for France and the
French. (When talking French to the French he uses no perceptible accent and
a lot of self-deprecating grunts.)
Outside the old farm buildings, swarming with workmen and Radio Narbonne,
was a British car, and a truck carrying a warning against bushfires in the
state of Victoria. English - or at least, 'Strine' - is the first language
of most key employees here. Inside, 60 year-old concrete wine vats, through
which a sea of once-profitable light red ordinaire has washed, are being
sandblasted and re-lined, ready to meet, late this summer, the requirements
of an array of technically exacting New World winemakers.
Yalumba, the south Australia winery, will be sending a winemaker to see what
he makes of French fruit; in the southern hemisphere he would be twiddling
his thumbs at this time of year. Jacques and Francois Lurton, young brothers
raised in Bordeaux but oenologically schooled in Australia, will also be
making wine here. And Global Vineyards plans to sell the first crop off its
Chardonnay vines, spread over three different, unusually large domaines, to
the huge Skalli operation in Sete, and to Hardy's, fellow Australians who
bought a large winery outside Beziers two years ago.
As we leave, we almost bump into a truck which is delivering the first
consignment of this year's purchase of millions of metres of wire, an
essential ingredient in imposing nurture rather than nature on the vines. We
pass a pretty farmhouse, apparently being turned into gites by an English
couple ('probably a far more sensible use of vineyard land' sighs Herrick).
Next comes the miserable sight of acres of ancient vines being properly
ripped out, including all possible associated pests and diseases, by a team
under Global Vineyards management. This is work for a neighbour who has been
impressed by what les Australiens have done, and plans to substitute modish
Chardonnay vines for his old Carignan and Cinsault stumps.
Current EC subsidies ensure that it is more profitable to rip out a
lacklustre old vineyard than to produce lacklustre wine for the local co-op
from it. 'But this guy actually wants to bottle the wine himself - a major
step forward,' says Herrick. 'The trouble is,' he adds, 'that this vine
pulling programme is artificially inflating the price of land here so that
only the brave, foolish or wealthy can afford to invest in it.'
We spend the rest of the day touring the properties of these brave, foolish
or wealthy creatures. Jacques Ribourel is certainly the last of these - one
of France's more successful real estate tycoons, who seems perfectly happy
to throw his millions into a large hole in the ground. He has heard that
underground wineries are a good idea, and so he has had a huge 20-ft crater
quarried out of the rock of La Clape mountain, between Narbonne and the sea,
at an estimated cost of FFr2m for the hole alone.
His Domaine de l'Hospitalet covers 1,000 hectares (2,500 acres), but he does
not like the shape of some of them, so they are being remodelled too.
Jeremie, his son, climbs down from his Paris-registered Range Rover to
explain that eventually there will 22 vine varieties planted, plus a
collection of local plants, a couple of outdoor theatres and lots, lots more
 -provided they can persuade plants to grow in the moonscape that is
l'Hospitalet at present.
Next stop is at an established wine domain recently bought by someone who
certainly qualifies as brave. Its size, and its output in the bad old days
of quantity above quality, is indicated by the length of the winery
building: at least a quarter of a mile of wine vats.
Driving up an abandoned avenue towards the other buildings, which once
included chapel, forge, workshops and school, James Herrick makes
disapproving noises about the dilapidated state of the vineyards. Local
gossip has it that the new owner, a Champenois, paid for this 200 hectare
property by selling two hectares of champagne vineyard.
As we dot about the rest of the region (eliciting in each village another
rumour about incoming investment), the temperature drops, the sky darkens
and so does Herrick's brow. There are still three more weeks during which
those juicy little Chardonnay sprouts could be hit by frost, and the less
worldly locals, who can't understand why the Australians are planting such
an outlandish vine on low-lying land anyway, could be proved right.
As things turn out, it looks as though Global Vineyards (France) will at
last have an entry on the credit side of the books this year. But it is
undoubtedly operating in Europe's hottest viticultural melting pot.

<TEXT>
THE MARQUESS of Salisbury will not be holding any more big dinner parties -
next Thursday, at Christie's, he is selling his last jeroboam of 1864
Chateau Latour. The jeroboam, equivalent to six normal bottles, has nestled
in the cellars at Hatfield House since it came over from Bordeaux. At some
period, it was swathed in brown paper to protect it from the light and to
ward off oxidisation.
The bottle will excite serious collectors. The 1864 was one of the finest
vintages of the 19th century - Queen Victoria served first-growth Lafite and
Latour regularly - and the appearance of a jeroboam is unprecedented. In
1877, Christie's was selling this Latour at around 185 shillings a dozen
magnums. Next week, the jeroboam is estimated at more than Pounds 2,500 -
but a word of warning: the wine level has slipped down to the shoulder of
the bottle, which could mean that it has passed its best. It depends if the
air above it is benign. The buyer will have an anxious moment before he
serves this rare remnant.
The jeroboam is the star of a spectacular wine auction, the best at
Christie's for many years. This is an ideal time to buy; prices for rarities
are roughly at the level of a decade ago. Many of the over-excited
collectors of the mid-1980s are sitting on wine they could sell only at a
loss; but death makes a nonsense of such calculations and the backbone of
the auction is the Parisian cellar of the late Cariar Kaspia, the great
caviar king.
Here are all the premier growths in excellent vintages. They range from four
bottles of Lafite 1844 (estimated at up to Pounds 2,600 each), through the
outstanding 1921 Chateau 'Yquem (up to Pounds 800 a bottle), on to the famed
1945 Mouton Rothschild, and beyond. Many of the wines, including the early
vintages, have been tasted by Christie's expert, Michael Broadbent, who
remains convinced that the pre-phylloxera vintages retain a distinction not
matched after 1880.
This is essentially a sale for serious wine buffs, but on July 2 Christie's
will be selling claret and white Bordeaux for everyday drinking. Next
Thursday's sale offers wines that will be bought by brokers to sell on to
the world's grand hotels and restaurants; in particular, to the newly-opened
and under-stocked - a third of the lots at Christie's last auction found
their way to the Regency Hotel in Hong Kong. But the other two strands are
curiosities that would give the rich pause: a selection of Tokay and of the
1792 Madeira. The two have a strong bond - they are the two
longest-surviving wines. There should be few worries about drinking
well-preserved 200-year-old Madeira or Tokay.
The Madeira includes eight bottles of the famed 1792. One, estimated at
Pounds 500-plus, is particularly well-travelled. It was part of a 'pipe'
taken on board the ship transporting Napoleon to exile on St Helena when it
stopped at Madeira for supplies. But the former emperor's gastric troubles
prevented him from drinking the wine.
In a nice twist, Sotheby's fine wine auction on Wednesday includes a bottle
of 1818 Grande Fine Champagne cognac, embossed with a crown and and bearing
the word 'Restauration' - obviously produced to celebrate the restoration of
the monarchy in France.
A report on the sale will be carried in Friday's FT.

FT  13 JUN 92 / Cookery: Soups for summer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIPPA DAVENPORT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
YESTERDAY was sun hat and sandal weather. Tonight I am lighting the fire.
Planning menus ahead has become a gamble. Last-minute impulse shopping and
cooking is one sensible solution.
In practice I find British summer evenings rarely so hot that the thought of
an entirely cold meal is enticing. A hot main course (providing it is not
too substantial) is usually best.
Poaching and steaming are good cooking methods to choose. Grilling may be
the most appealing of all, not least because it is so quick. What is more,
if grilling is done outdoors on a barbecue, the workload may be shifted onto
other shoulders or at least shared.
Juicy lamb chops, young rabbit, chicken and quail, vegetables and fish of
all sorts, make good candidates on these occasions, and all are delicious
simply served with a few new potatoes and a leafy salad.
If the weather is in a Mediterranean mood, try to rid yourself of the
British obsession with red-hot food and plates. Tiede can be a desirable
temperature for dishes other than quiche.
Preface the grill with soup and follow it with soft fresh fruits and cheese,
and you have a meal that is relatively little sweat for the cook.
Two of the following soups should be served chilled. This means that they
need to be made several hours ahead, but that does not mean burning your
culinary boats if the weather turns chilly, just a postponement of serving
the soup. (Soup can be kept safely in the fridge for 2-3 days; if the
barometer plummets, freeze it for longer safekeeping.)
On cool evenings, begin dinner instead with an impromptu and quickly
prepared little comforter, such as oeuf en cocotte a la creme. This classic
French standby is long overdue for a comeback in Britain. If there is a
Sainsbury's branch near you, use its lovely creme fraiche d'Isigny to make
this dish, with a blade or two of tarragon for fragrance.
The other soup given here is the turncoat, capable of beating the weather at
its own game. In other words it is equally good served chilled if the
evening is fine or hot if the weather plays foul.
LOVAGE SOUP WITH BUTTERMILK (serves 4-6)
2-3 shallots;  3/4 -1 lb potatoes; a generous handful of fresh young lovage
leaves; at least 1 1/2 pt light chicken stock;  1/2 pt buttermilk.
Chop the shallots finely. Peel and grate the potatoes. Put both ingredients
into a pan. Pour on 1 1/2 pt stock and bring to simmering point, stirring
occasionally to stop the potato starch sticking to the bottom of the pan.
Stir in 6-7 tablespoons shredded lovage leaves. Cover and simmer gently for
10-15 minutes, stirring once or twice, until the vegetables are perfectly
tender.
Whizz to a fine green flecked puree. Blend in the buttermilk and season
lightly. Thin with more stock to give good consistency, and add extra lovage
to taste.
Serve well chilled or reheated very gently - on no account boil it, or the
buttermilk will curdle.
CUCUMBER SOUP WITH PRAWNS AND DILL (serves 4)
1 large cucumber; 6 oz cooked prawns in the shell; a bouquet of dill; 3/4 pt
creamy yoghurt; a little sugar and white wine vinegar.
Shell the prawns. Simmer the shells with a sprig or two of dill and water to
cover in a tightly lidded pan for 25 minutes. Process briefly and sieve
carefully to separate the flavoursome liquid from the debris. Fast-boil the
shellfish stock until reduced to about  1/4 pt.
Peel and seed the cucumber. Put the peel into a processor. Add  1/2 teaspoon
salt, 1 teaspoon sugar, 1 1/2 teaspoons vinegar and the stock. Whizz to a
very finely flecked green puree.
Strain the liquid and stir it gradually into the yoghurt to make a smooth
pale green cream. Grate the cucumber flesh, chop the prawns and a tablespoon
or two of feathery dill leaves. Stir them into the soup and chill for
several hours to allow flavours to blend and infuse.
Season to taste with salt, pepper, vinegar and dill, and thin the soup, if
need be, with a little iced water or stock, just before serving.
SPANISH ALMOND SOUP (serves 4-5)
3 oz almond kernels in their brown skins; 1 1/2 oz crustless white bread;
1-2 garlic cloves; 4 tablespoons olive oil; 1 tablespoon sherry vinegar;
1/4 lb grapes, preferably muscat, skinned, halved and de-seeded.
Pour boiling water over the almonds and leave for a couple of minutes, then
slip off their skins. Crush the garlic with half a teaspoon or more of salt.
Then whizz the garlic and nuts in a food processor with a few spoonfuls of
water to make a smoothish paste.
Add the bread, olive oil and vinegar and whizz again until creamy. Gradually
mix in 1-1 1/4 pt iced water. Cover and chill for a few hours to allow
flavours to blend and mature.
Just before serving, adjust seasoning, thin with more iced water to taste,
and stir in the grapes. It is the combination of sweetness and pungency that
makes this soup so refreshing.

FT  13 JUN 92 / How to Spend It: Chaps and chukkas and polo pin-ups - Lucia
van der Post finds how best to dress for sporting success off the field, and
discovers a new lease of life at Dunhill
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCIA VAN DER POST
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   POLO was once a sport like any other
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
except more expensive. Chaps on ponies tore round fields, wielding sticks
and playing chukkas while their womenfolk and assorted hangers-on used it as
a fine excuse for quaffing Krug and eyeing both the ponies and the chaps.
Then the marketing men began to realise that all that manliness, that heady
mix of outdoorsiness, of skill and derring-do and the glamorous groupies it
attracted, offered a heaven-sent opportunity to promote their wares.
Thus was ushered in the sponsored polo event, which turns the Guards Polo
Club's Smith's Lawn at Windsor into a passable imitation of an Indian
durbar, without the heatstroke. The marquees billow, the flags fly, the
champagne flows and the glitterati turn up in their hundreds.
The sartorial problem this poses is that an invitation to one of the great
sponsored days at Smiths' Lawn, which even now many of you may be
contemplating, is no longer just an invitation to a sporting event - it is
also a social one, where the purpose of the exercise is no longer just to
count the goals, tread in the divots and marvel at the skills but also to
see and be seen, and possibly be photographed. What, then, does one wear?
Last Sunday saw the first of the great sponsored days when Alfred Dunhill
entertained some 400 guests, polo names, glamorati, journalists and
marketing men to lunch and tea. Notions of appropriate dress varied from
chic little cocktail numbers, glittery jewels and dinky handbags to
laid-back jeans and blazers.
If in doubt it is, of course, not much use taking one's lead from the Queen,
who has that endearing habit of looking as if she has just nipped out into
her own back garden - which, of course, she has.
Habituees of the polo grounds can be easily spotted - they wear well-cut
jeans, crisp white shirts, navy-blue blazers, Gucci loafers, good scarves,
Alice bands and chain-handled bags. On anybody young, long-legged and
long-maned the look is great - a bit stereotyped maybe, but classy and
appropriate. Of those lunching in the smart marquees the most successful
outfits seemed the simplest. The American contingent is usually band-box
smart - hats, designer suits, lots of jewellery - but at Smiths' Lawn it
tends to look a little overdone.
Dunhill warns its guests. 'This is an English outdoor sporting event. Please
bring sensible shoes and a raincoat.' And just in case their guests fail to
get the message about the peculiarities of the English summer, it hands out
umbrellas and blankets at the door.
Of the Americans, Christina Ford, in a striking but simple black and wool
suit, looked warm (often essential), comfortable and at ease - always a good
start. Navy wool or linen blazers over a silky vest and teamed with simple
skirts, either long or short, looked good. Really good loafers or other flat
shoes somehow looked more appropriate (treading in the divots between
chukkas is part of the ritual) than high heels.
Miriam Francome, estranged wife of the jockey John Francome, looked
wonderfully relaxed and at ease in soft, trousers, a check jacket by Victor
Edelstein and a simple vest, all in sophisticated neutral shades. Dawn
Mello, design supremo at Gucci and responsible for breathing new life, wit
and vitality into the brand, was Gucci-clad from head to toe - warm
three-quarters jacket over a shortish skirt in a soft peachy shade, simple
creamy vest, pale tights, taupe court shoes and. of course, one of those
bamboo-handled handbags.
Opinion on hats is divided. They are probably de rigueur if you hope to
catch a paparazzi's lens or are in the serious glamour business, like
Anouska Hempel and Joan Collins. Otherwise I incline to the view that they
look a little bit too dressy, as if their wearers are trying too hard. Apart
from anything else, they impede other people's view.
As for the men, there were plenty of suits, all looking perfectly
appropriate if a little formal, but somehow a navy blazer, grey flannels and
loafers looked that much more relaxed. Lord Patrick Beresford, in navy-blue
blazer, stone wool gaberdine trousers with turn-ups, and loafers, got it
absolutely right.
THERE IS something peculiarly piquant about the future Duke of Wellington
setting out to woo and win one of the jewels in the crown of the Parisian
Haut Monde - the tres, tres chic house of Karl Lagerfeld.
When Dunhill Holdings (of which Lord Douro, the future Duke of Wellington,
is chairman) felt in need of some heady feminine charm to provide some
pizzaz to its image, in the hallowed tradition of 19th century English
mi'lords, Lord Douro cast his eye across the Channel, where it alighted on
Karl Lagerfeld.
Not that buying the talents of the eccentric 'Kaiser Karl' is a mere
aristocratic faiblesse or folie. It is all part of a hard-headed, carefully
worked-out strategy - building up Dunhill Holdings into a leader in quality
brands.
Dunhill until recently has seemed to outsiders almost like a sleeping giant
 -a splendid brand name, but where were the products to match?
Dunhill's long-term strategy is clearly to build a luxury prestige group
that will appeal to the Japanese and the rest of the hugely lucrative Far
Eastern market, one that will compete with the best in the world.
When it comes to menswear, in which the company is very strong, most of what
it needs - an old and traditional presence in London (the Jermyn Street
flagship store) and a clutch of instantly recognisable and desirable
products - it already has. But to cash in on the vast amounts of feminine
cash that currently finds its way into names like Yves St. Laurent, Chanel,
Hermes and the like it needed a much stronger feminine brand - which is
where Karl Lagerfeld and Chloe (bought by Dunhill in 1985) come in.
Dunhill is one of those essentially British brands: sound, solid, (and VERY
VERY profitable) but lacking a certain elan. Think Dunhill and what comes to
mind? Navy-blue blazer, pipes, tobacco, and watches - all very understated
and fine quality, but a little short on true allure.
If short on allure, Dunhill has not been short of profits. Cash rich and
solidly profitable it has come an enormous distance since the 1970s when
annual profits were languishing in single figures (about Pounds 3m) and the
core of the business was smokers' accessories. Today, profits stand at
Pounds 48m (after tax) and smokers' accessories account for just 3 per cent
of the business.
The product range has been carefully and greatly extended,but the brand has
never been debased. Distribution and outlets have been carefully controlled.
Acquisitions such as Mont Blanc (which was turning in losses when Dunhill
bought it and has since become a money-spinner) and Hackett, the oh-so-pukka
menswear business with the slightly fogeyish air, are all fine quality
businesses.
Dunhill's big problem, however, is that it is rather like the prophet
lacking honour and recognition in its own country. Its image is far stronger
in the Far East (where it is right up there with Chanel, Vuitton, Hermes and
Cartier) than it is here in Britain and Europe. For the moment much of its
efforts are being channelled into consolidating itself in Europe - which, of
course, is essential if it is to go on selling sell well in the Far East, as
an image of old European tradition is primarily what the Japanese are
buying. In Europe there are still too few Dunhill shops - just nine (five in
the UK, three in Germany, one in France) - so plans are afoot to open at
least two more this year, one in Madrid and one in Geneva.
The addition of the ebullient Lagerfeld to the stable offers a great
opportunity for profile-raising. It is still early days to see exactly what
all this will mean to the British consumer. There can hardly be a more
exciting designer in the world than Lagerfeld, and if the Dunhill connection
means that his abundant talents will be made more accessible then we may all
have cause to celebrate.
Mounir Moufarrige, the Paris-based Dunhill Holdings director responsible for
developing both the Chloe and the Lagerfeld labels, has every intention of
making both labels more accessible, not just in Britain but all over the
world. 'They will be two distinct entirely different lines, each competing
with the other. The Lagerfeld label will be strong, pointed,
forward-looking, while the Chloe line will be softer, rounded, lighter, more
feminine, very sensual. More shops - both for the Chloe and the Karl
Lagerfeld label - are certainly planned, but also we are already working on
a much expanded range of products for both labels.'
In couture-house speak, 'expanded range of products' means accessories - the
real route to riches. Couture houses are not, of course, about couture -
they are about selling silk scarves, gilded belts, must-have jewellery,
definitive shoes, heady perfumes at loadsa dollars a time. It is not lost on
anybody that at Chanel (where, eight years ago, Karl Lagerfeld was brought
in to revitalise the dying brand and in so doing doubled the fortune of its
owner, Alain Wertheimer) five out of every six sales are in accessories.
It is not just that the product range will be expanded - the shops are to be
given a much more striking and more consistent look, and early next year we
should begin to see the first fruits of these efforts.
As to the question of whether 'Kaiser Karl's' talent can encompass both
labels (as well as what he already does for Chanel and Fendi) Mounir
Moufarrige has no doubts. 'It has been like an engagement - we have been
talking for well over a year, discussing these questions before we, so to
speak, made the marriage. Lagerfeld designed for Chloe for twenty years
before so he feels as if he were coming home. The two sides of his
personality - the sharp and the soft - need different outlets.'
Flag-waving is out of fashion these days but nonetheless it would be good to
see a British luxury goods company of the stature of Dunhill give the
French-based LVMH a real run for its money.

FT  13 JUN 92 / How To Spend It: Cameo appearances - They're small, subtle
and sought after . . . - Janet Marsh previews a major sale of sophisticated
art
</HEADLINE>

PERHAPS it is the attraction of opposites: cameos, which are among the
smallest of art works, have had a peculiar appeal throughout history to
royal collectors graced with the sobriquet 'Great.' Alexander the Great and
Mithridates the Great both had legendary collections. So, in the modern era,
did Catherine the Great of Russia, by far the most voracious collector of
all time. Admitting to being gripped by 'cameo fever,' Catherine bought up
collections throughout Europe. Her hoard, which finally numbered more than
10,000, now resides in the Hermitage at St Petersburg.
The most notorious royal collector was Prince Stanislaw Poniatowsky, whose
enthusiasm began when he inherited 150 historic engraved gems from his
uncle, King Stanislas Augustus of Poland. By the time of his death in 1839,
the number had grown to 2,601, 1,800 of them bearing the signatures of all
the great artists of the ancient world. Alas, when the collection came on
the market in London, Victorian society was scandalised to learn that the
signatures, like the greater part of the collection, were fake -
commissioned by Poniatowsky himself from contemporary Italian craftsmen.
After a century and a half, Poniatowsky's posthumous disgrace readily is
forgiven. He chose his artists well, so that his 'fakes' often are valuable
works of art in their own right. Several intaglios from these 'fakes' will
realise as much as Pounds 3,000 each when they are sold by Sotheby's on
Thursday.
They are part of an anonymous collection of more than 250 cameos and
intaglios which Sotheby's experts consider to be the best to come on the
market since the second world war. Studying these exquisite little gems, it
is easy to understand the enthusiasm of collectors during two millenia.
Cameo carving is one of the subtlest and most sophisticated arts bequeathed
by the ancient world. Its special skill consisted in carving a precious
stone, formed in layers of different colours, in such a way that one colour
served as a ground for figures cut in relief in the upper layer of
contrasting colour. Different stones - onyx, agate, sardonyx, chalcedony -
gave different colour effects. Indian sardonyx, for instance, would combine
white and yellow with reddish browns; Arabian sardonyx provided cold blues
and blacks.
For most of the history of cameo carving, the same primitive tools were used
to work the immensely hard stones (often it was said that it took as long to
cut a large cameo as to build an entire cathedral). Originating in
Alexandria at the end of the 4th century BC, the art reached a peak in the
Hellenic and Roman periods. Portraiture and mythological and pastoral scenes
predominated. Alexander the Great would be portrayed only by his court
craftsman, Pyrgoteles. Emperor Augustus's personal sculptor, Dioskourides,
the most influential of classical cameo artists, continued tactfully to
portray his master as a comely youth for decade after decade.
The art of cameo carving survived through the early Christian and Byzantine
eras to flower again in 13th and 14th century France and Italy, when the
favoured subjects were religious and heraldic. The Renaissance brought
renewed interest in classical antiquity and spawned a new breed of rich and
passionate collectors and patrons like the papacy, the Medicis, and Lorenzo
the Magnificent. Artists supplied them with copies of the antique, but also
developed new contemporary styles.
Essentially a classical art form, the cameo declined both in technique and
fashion with the baroque taste of the 17th century - only to re-emerge to a
final rich flowering with 18th century Neoclassicism. In this period, the
passion for cameos became epidemic. Every European gentleman of culture and
means had to have his personal collection - or at least a few of the sets of
casts of famous gems which were marketed along with descriptive catalogues.
Distinctive schools of cameo art grew and flourished in France, Germany,
Austria, England and, above all, Italy. In England, the finest cameo
sculptors were the brothers William and Charles Brown, 400 of whose works -
around half their total output - were commissioned by Catherine the Great
and are now in the Hermitage. A William Brown cameo portrait of the Duke of
Wellington appears in the Sotheby's sale, estimated at Pounds 800-1,200.
The saleroom estimates suggest that cameos are still under-valued. Prices
anticipated for a group of 16th century agate cameos range, for instance,
from a few hundred pounds to Pounds 3,000-4,000 for a finely sculpted bust
portrait of a warrior in a contemporary gold mount; this seems a very modest
price for a Renaissance art work of high quality. The highest estimates
(Pounds 5,000-7,000 each) are for two exceptional works from the
neo-classical period: large, double-sided cameos by the Roman masters,
Giuseppe Girometti and Giuseppe Cerbera.
Cameo prices may, in fact, still reflect the decline in enthusiasm that
resulted from the mass of spurious and mechanical cameo work turned out late
in the 19th century. There are signs, however, that the time is ripe for a
return to style and favour, with fashionable designers like Bulgari now
leaning to archaeological inspiration for their jewellery designs.

FT  13 JUN 92 / How To Spend It: Summer reading - Book Fairs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM ST CLAIR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR book collectors, June is a high point of the year. The antiquarian and
second-hand book trade holds a series of fairs in London hotels at which
many thousands of tomes can be seen. Although more than half those sold go
to other dealers, the public are welcome.
The biggest selection of books, about 85,000, can be seen at the two fairs
in the Hotel Russell in Russell Square, Bloomsbury. These are sometimes
called the London Fairs, or the Russell Fairs, although are still known as
the PBFA, from the initials of the association which organises them.
Most books cost less than Pounds 100 - many much less. The stock changes
between the two fairs, but buying the catalogue for the first will let you
in to the second. On two of the days experienced dealers offer a roadshow at
which they give advice and valuations, although they are not permitted to
make offers.
The other 'London' fair, held at the Bonnington Hotel nearby in Southampton
Row, off Russell Square, is smaller. Most dealers are part-timers, and the
books are cheaper and more modern. On two of the days the book fair is
joined by dealers in maps and prints, some from the International Antique
Map Fair, to be held at the New Connaught Rooms in Great Queen Street, off
Kingsway.
The Bloomsbury fair, at the Royal National Hotel in Bedford Way, near
Russell Square, is comparable to its bigger rival at the Russell Hotel, with
a pleasing mixture of antiquarian and modern. The 'International', at the
Cafe Royal at the foot of Regent Street, includes a few dealers from abroad
but consists mostly of British dealers offering books from about Pounds 100
up.
The most expensive books are to be found at the Antiquarian Booksellers
Association (ABA) fair at the Park Lane hotel - which, confusingly, is not
in Park Lane but at the Hyde Park Corner end of Piccadilly. The fair opens
at 6pm during the preview evening on Tuesday June 23. The catalogue, which
serves as an entry fee, costs Pounds 15, but falls to Pounds 6 the following
morning.
You can buy a page of music in the handwriting of Beethoven for Pounds
28,500 (Wilson) or an original quarto of The Wealth of Nations for Pounds
20,000 (Steedman). The most moving item is a manuscript 'Character Book'
listing the convicts bound for Western Australia on board the Edwin Fox in
August 1858 (Remington, Pounds 5,000). It records the names, ages, former
occupations, crimes and other details of 284 unfortunate men compelled to
leave their country for their country's good.
This article is reprinted from last week's Weekend FT; the original article
contained a number of inaccuracies because of a computer error.

FT  13 JUN 92 / How To Spend It: Whizz-kids in greener pastures - Lucia van
der Post on the growing band of born-again craftsmen
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCIA VAN DER POST
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IF THE recession has meant gloomy times for some, it has also offered new
opportunities to others. Many of those bright young things who used to earn
telephone-number salaries that they never had time to spend have found that
there are other ways of earning a living than gazing at screens in offices.
Many have started small businesses, and found a great deal of pleasure in
new ways of living.
All sorts of chaps who in years gone by would have been adding up figures in
accountancy practices, working in banks or defending the law are these days
to be found digging gardens, making furniture, framing pictures and
generally discovering a great deal of fun in creating and making things with
their hands.
This is good news for those of us who are looking for the small and
not-so-small special things that cannot be bought off-the-shelf. We are now
spoilt for choice when it comes to finding people to build a cupboard for a
strange-shaped corner, a table to a special size, a chair of precise
dimensions. The recession has meant that craftsmen are keener than ever to
give the customer exactly what he or she wants.
Take Philip Hearsey, who from his base in Herefordshire heads up a small
design team working in the area of architectural, interior and furniture
design. I featured some of his designs on this page last year, but since
then he has moved on, developed his range and his ideas and now has a richer
selection than ever for potential customers to choose from.
He still makes much of the furniture for the interiors he designs because
run-of-the-mill production-line furniture does not fit the bill.
The new range he has developed has a strong medieval character - for
instance the large cabinet, photographed top right, looks for all the world
as if it were hewn out of some rather solid timbers and was designed to fit
into the house of a Spanish nobleman. In fact it is made from English beech,
distressed and coloured, and it is the hand-forged ironwork and the heavily
carved panels that gives it its strong medieval air.
This particular cabinet conceals a drinks cabinet which is fitted with
brilliant blue lacquered paintwork but, of course, anybody ordering the
cabinet would specify the internal requirements. The price varies, depending
upon the fittings, but the cabinet alone would be about Pounds 3,000.
One of the qualities of Philip Hearsey's work is its air of strength and
solidity, much of which comes from the abundant use of hand-forged metal
components - the result of the relationships he has built up with other
workshops and craftspeople all over the UK.
Whilst he will take on all sorts of commissions - whether for whole
buildings and all the fitments, large cabinets or complete kitchens - I am
possibly most attracted to his smaller pieces of furniture. Occasional
tables are a notoriously difficult area if dinky nests and glass-topped
steel-legged versions are not your taste - Philip Hearsey provides some
wonderful options. There is, for instance, a beautifully turned piece of
solid elm or oak, 375 mm in diameter, 450 mm high, which doubles as a stool
or table, for Pounds 464.13. There is the Tom-tom, a huge lump of turned elm
settled into a four-legged stand, for Pounds 605.
Hearsey works in metal, wood, stone or granite and uses them to create
pieces that have great strength and originality. His small tables with
wrought-iron bases and glass or wood tops, sometimes carved, sometimes
plain, would be very useful in halls or as side tables and are completely
different from anything else I have seen on the market.
Philip Hearsey can be contacted at Monkhall Court, Callow, Hereford HRT 8DA.
Tel: 0432-351170, or, in London, 071-244-9825.
David Savage is another furniture maker who, though he makes a lot of
special one-off pieces, has a recognisable hand-writing to his work. He
always has available a range of chairs and tables which can be seen and
ordered at 21 Westcombe Lane, Bideford, Devon EX39 3JQ, and other examples
of his work can be seen at The Design and Decoration Building, 107a Pimlico
Road, London SW1W 8PH.
He works a great deal in English hardwoods such as sycamore, pear or yew.
The particular piece photographed bottom right was originally specially
commissioned and was made from solid yew. The client asked for a 'simple but
elegant occasionable table that could be used as a dining table in the
traditional Japanese manner.' Many of his European clients liked the design
and found that the height worked well alongside a traditional upholstered
sofa, so he has now incorporated it into his standard range. Available in
different sizes and timbers, it costs about Pounds 1,950.
Rupert Senior and Charles Wheeler-Carmichael have been designing and making
individual pieces of furniture to special commission for several years.
Their pieces range from a conference table seating 28 delegates to a
four-poster bed and the child's chair photographed far left.
This is slightly different as it is produced in a limited edition. Made from
timber salvaged from the 'Great Storm of 1987' they call it the Lilliput
chair, and they hope it will prove popular as a Christmas, birthday or
christening present.
The Lilliput chair costs Pounds 535.00 plus VAT and is available from Senior
Carmichael, Whitehouse Workshop, Church Street, Betchworth, Surrey RH3 7DN.
Tel: 0737-844316.

FT  13 JUN 92 / Gardening: Rocket and rolls at the opera - Gardens to Visit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBIN LANE FOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COSI Fan Tutte: These Things All Women Do . . . according to Mozart, they
flirt stupendously as soon as their fiances' backs are turned; they have the
morals of a butterfly; serving maids are even worse, and neither maids nor
ladies can resist a compliment. In Mozart's view, all these things happen in
the 18th century when fiances appear to go off to war. His opera lives in
the mind, but I have just had my idea of it turned upside down.
It has been turned upside down by Glyndebourne. It is more than a matter of
the set and direction: anything goes nowadays, and I suppose that a
Mediterranean liner in Edwardian times is as good a setting as any other if
you decide to ignore Mozart's own intentions.
It is perhaps bad luck that, this year, the two fiances look decidedly like
the Maxwell brothers in disguise. The upheaval, in my case, went further
than the setting: it extended to the modern meaning of the title.
Ladies, perhaps, still have butterfly morals, but at Glyndebourne these are
not the Only Things All Women Do. So far as I could discover, they do not
flirt. Instead, they sit on ground-sheets and swap little bits of salmon on
rye bread; after act one, they produce chicken legs in aspic from plastic
containers; and they try to stop the icing looking lop-sided on the designer
pudding of the week.
Before and after the first act, they dispense a corporate picnic for menfolk
and such clients as can be persuaded to leave London in a dinner jacket in
mid-afternoon. What Women Do, when their husbands have risen high enough in
the corporate army, seems to be to hold a sort of Tupperware party for
oldies on a grass lawn between rose beds and a herd of Sussex cows.
It is 30 years since anyone last invited me to see this British spectacle.
Naturally, there have been changes. In the 1950s, bridge rolls were still in
evidence and people might be wearing suede shoes under their dinner jackets.
In the 1990s, halting French is spoken on picnic rugs to make European
clients feel at home. 'Et puis,' I heard, 'le moteur dans le bateau was en
anglais on dit conked out.'
Communications have improved drastically for anyone who regrets leaving home
before bedtime. I eavesdropped while a father dialled his son on the
cordless telephone to check that he had survived the first day of the common
entrance exam, which was designed to waft him on to a public school.
There was also the matter of the garden. Thirty years ago, there was vastly
less of it, but it looks as if there will be even more in another five
years. The mowing is extending ambitiously past the open water and out
beside the cow fields; irregular beds have been filled for the moment with
white foxgloves; music is the focus of the evening but the garden is not a
poor second fiddle, losing its pitch gradually.
It has to be run collectively, and its upkeep must always influence change.
Individual touches of eccentricity are laborious and inappropriate: it needs
to loom elegantly through the evening light while the picnics are balancing
an hour or two's attention to a high-class score.
Along the terraces, ruby-pink valerian and violet-blue geraniums keep
company with quartered roses in old-fashioned shades of pink and white.
Colours tend to be segregated. The walls of the opera house are a weathered
background for fine climbers; no other theatre has such a floral setting for
enjoyment between acts.
As I picked my way through the Highland rugs, I admired it, but found it
curious. In this difficult year, there are few weeds and even fewer flopping
roses, but the effect strikes a chord from an earlier era.
Never before have I felt that gardens, too, have age bands. At Glyndebourne,
the colours and planting suit the profile of the audience: middle-aged,
proven performers not deterred when exposing their finery to an evening in
the rain. Perhaps it is the ruby-pinks and violet-blues, and perhaps it
looks quite different in August. Like most of the ticket-holders, the
borders have roots in the early 1960s: the picture is suited by its frame,
corporate Tupperware among pastel planting as the light fades and the cows
stay their distance behind a wavy fence of Sussex post and rail.
Inside and outside, the sense of period varies. If an ocean liner in a
Mozart opera strikes you as rum, there is always the garden in the interval
to reassure you that your generation still is true to its tone.
Last week, I envied a superb orange-yellow fremontodendron, that
wall-climber with rough leaves which tend to make admirers sneeze. Up one
wing of the opera house, it is out of reach of noses and is flowering as if
at home in its native California. At a lower level, the winter has been
kinder to Glyndebourne's large-leaved erodiums than to mine, all of which
have died. The star turn there is the one called pelargonifolium, which has
white flowers, dark markings and leaves like a geranium.
By now, the roses round the opera must be looking their best and we could
all copy the casual presence of white foxgloves through borders which are
starting to make a mark. For my money, however, the star of the evening lay
elsewhere.
Through many of the borders, the Glyndebourne gardeners have scattered the
simple White Sweet Rocket, that wonderful filler for the early June gap.
Anyone can grow it from packets of seed, sown outdoors now in order to
flower next year.
It flourishes in half-shade, even beneath hedges, where it will reach a
height and width of about 2 ft. Seedsmen tend to sell mixtures of the
purple-and-white varieties, but pure hesperis alba or White Form is the only
one you want.
It is no use asking me for ideas about a picnic or how to scrape mayonnaise
off a rug. My lesson from the evening is that sowing White Sweet Rocket is
one of the things that all of us, male and female, ought to do.

FT  13 JUN 92 / Gardening: Lost paradise blooms anew - Arthur Hellyer looks
at an ambitious restoration project in Cornwall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ARTHUR HELLYER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BRAVEST attempt at garden reclamation being undertaken in Britain must
be the Heligan Manor project near Mevagissey, Cornwall.
There was a time when Heligan was one of the most admired gardens in that
area. A garden of some kind existed there as early as 1603. By 1735 it had
been expanded, and by 1839 the outlines of the present garden largely were
complete.
It was to the the map of that year that a team of restorers turned to
discover this pattern and, in particular, the position of the paths, which
were buried beneath 18 in of soil. When they dug where the map indicated the
paths should be, they discovered them virtually intact - but, before I
continue, I must explain how a garden of this importance came to get into
this kind of condition.
Heligan always has belonged to the Tremayne family and still is part of its
estate. But no member of the family has lived in it for years and the house,
which is in excellent condition, is let as flats.
I visited Heligan in 1950 when it was let to one tenant who is said to have
expected that, because of the exceptional quality of its rhododendrons, it
would be given the status of a national monument. Nothing of that sort ever
happened. The rhododendrons certainly were remarkable but much of the garden
was overgrown already.
In the mid-1960s, a note in the Royal Horticultural Society's journal said
the garden was to be bulldozed and that anyone could take cuttings of
surviving plants. Again, nothing of the kind happened and the garden simply
sank deeper into decay with a vast overgrowth of laurels, brambles and weeds
that choked it. It was said that Heligan garden was finished and could never
be reclaimed.
Tim Smit had other ideas. He is a Dutch archaeologist who worked in the
London music publishing market and then transferred his energy to Heligan.
He persuaded some of his friends that his ideas were not entirely mad - and,
more important, he also convinced those with money and influence, including
Cornwall county council, to back him. In March 1991 he acquired a lease of
the garden and started work.
This spring, I was able to walk with Smit around the grounds to see and
photograph his marvellous plants and even to penetrate a little way into a
second garden of about equal size, a little distance to the south in a
well-watered valley. In Edwardian times this was laid out as a Japanese
garden, but it is now known as the tropical garden because of its luxuriance
and its bamboos, tree ferns and many other sub-tropical plants.
What made Heligan so special was that it was one of the first gardens to
receive seeds and seedlings from the Joseph Dalton Hooker expedition of
1948-49 to Sikkim and the outskirts of Tibet. Some of the very oldest
specimens of rhododendron arboreum are at Heligan, and there is a gigantic
bush of R. Cornish Red which measures 82 ft from root to tip.
Growth there is much more luxuriant than in the Himalayas. I saw very fine
bushes of purple R. niveum and photographed flowers of the original
blood-red R. arboreum, now very scarce in cultivation. This is, however,
much more than a rhododendron garden and it is not even of these opulent
shrubs that Smit and his colleagues dream most vividly.
There was - and, surprisingly, still is - a great collection of fine trees
and shrubs there, including camellias and some of the original plants of
cornus capitata which once formed an avenue in the main drive but which now
are reduced to just a few plants.
Arrangements have been made with a skilled propagator to increase stock of
any of the plants still growing at Heligan, and also to raise plants that
once were there but have been lost and are to be re-introduced.
Even this is not the end of the dream - in fact, it is only the beginning.
Most of all, Smit wants to resurrect the Georgian and Victorian buildings.
These include the ancient glasshouses and the vinery that are among the
earliest in England; the melon yard and the pineapple pits; the bee-bole, a
shelter in which bee skeps were placed and protected suitably in winter; the
old rockeries; the wishing well and the dipping pool; the cut flower garden,
and a great many other old features.
Already this remarkable garden is open to the public seven days a week. The
going is rough and I would not recommend it for the disabled, but it makes
fascinating viewing for those who are reasonably able-bodied.

FT  13 JUN 92 / Gardening: Plant of the Week - Kolkwitzia Pink Cloud
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ARTHUR HELLYER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
This is the best variety of Kolkwitzia amabilis, a very free-flowering
deciduous shrub that flowers in early June. It is usually six to eight feet
high and has long arching branches crowded with deep pink flowers. American
gardeners, who seem to have taken to it more rapidly than those in the UK,
call it the Beauty Bush. It is quite hardy, unfussy about soil and it can be
pruned, if it gets too big, by cutting off the old flowering stems
immediately the flowers fade. If it is increased by seed some seedlings may
be of inferior colour or performance. Pink Cloud should be increased by
summer cuttings to keep it true to type.

FT  13 JUN 92 / Property: Developers target golden oldies - But don't call
them that, these days, if you're retired or getting close, then you're in
the third age

<TEXT>
and then what? Not old age, but the marketing people's latest euphemism:
third age. At least, that is what Commercial Union is calling it.
Those who think that getting old brings health and financial problems may be
surprised that CU sees the third age as 'the age of independence and
contentment. The age of living. The age of doing all the things you've never
had time to do.'
With 9m retired people in Britain and nearly 12m in the pre-retirement stage
of 45-plus, this is the fastest-growing sector of the population. As far as
CU salesmen are concerned, the retired and pre-retired are big spenders on
financial and health-related products.
So, after two years' research, CU has launched its Third Age Initiative,
with new insurance policies for 'well-being,' 'health-wise' and the
intriguingly named 'life-plus,' which does not actually guarantee
resurrection but does provide long-term care as well as life cover.
CU, which owns 49.9 per cent of Haven Services - the company that manages
retirement developments for Anglia Secure Homes (in which CU also has a 12.2
per cent stake) - also is backing Anglia in a new venture to develop nursing
homes for regional health authorities.
Anglia has set up a joint-venture company, Haven Healthcare, with Nash Sells
&amp; Partners, to provide three nursing homes for North-East Essex Health
Authority at Clacton, Colchester and Halstead, and others at Wokingham,
Reading and Maldon. Talks are also being held with other health authorities,
and another six 50-bed nursing homes are likely to be built over the next
four-five years.
Haven Healthcare will provide and operate these homes, and the health
authorities have contracted to take at least 70 per cent of the beds at
Pounds 300-400 a week for each resident for at least five years. 'There is
far less risk in this than in developing sheltered housing,' says Peter
Edmondson, chairman of Anglia. (Its annual report, due out next week, will
show pre-tax losses of Pounds 16.9m for the year to September 30 1991, in
which sales fell from 443 to 293 units).
'If we had done nothing but build sheltered housing for the past three
years, I don't think we would be here now. We have survived by
diversification, by developing our service and care side.'
Haven Services is now providing care services and products to more than
5,000 residents in about 100 developments (including those of other
companies). These include home helps for cleaning, washing, cooking and
other tasks; meals on wheels; lifeline emergency telephones linked to a
monitoring centre; and home carers for the infirm.
Anglia is now looking to develop more care centres on the lines of its
Little Holland Hall near Clacton, Essex, where conventional sheltered
housing is developed alongside close-care accommodation and a nursing home,
enabling the elderly to lead independent lives in their own home within a
caring community for as long as they can.
After two disastrous financial years, Anglia still has 341 units for sale in
29 English developments, but it has resumed work on the second phase of its
schemes at Ferndown in Dorset, King's Lynn in Norfolk, and Hitchin in
Hertfordshire.
Earlier this year, to take advantage of what he saw as bargains in the
sheltered housing field, Edmondson and a group of private investors set up
another company, Jaygate, to buy developments from receivers at substantial
discounts. So far, Jaygate has bought four schemes - at Bishop's Stortford,
Faringdon, Chertsey and Bognor Regis - from the receivers of Sovereign
Retirement Properties.
These have been re-branded as Anglia developments, and 78 of the 110 unsold
flats have been bought. Jaygate is paying Anglia full professional fees for
its sales and marketing services, and it is meeting 75 per cent of
Edmondson's Pounds 100,000 salary as chairman of Anglia, so the public
company makes profits with no risk. 'Banks and building societies should
talk to us about selling their sheltered housing schemes under our banner
instead of appointing receivers,' he says.
In fact, Haven Services already has been brought in by Cork Gully,
Nationwide Anglia and the Halifax Building Society to act as selling agents
for sheltered housing schemes in Essex, Hertfordshire and Bristol.
'Receivers do not have the sales and marketing teams to handle sheltered
housing schemes,' Edmondson adds. 'One we are talking to at the moment has
sold only eight units on 12 sites in the past two years.'
In the worst housing market anyone can remember, Anglia is expecting to sell
200-250 units in this financial year. If the market picks up in the second
half of the year, the company could soon find itself without sufficient
stock.

FT  13 JUN 92 / Property: High premium for a Jekyll gem
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID HOPPIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TUCKED AWAY at the bottom of most estate agents' particulars is a reference
to 'pleasant landscaped gardens', or 'well-stocked borders'. Many indeed are
the horticultural howlers - 'rhododendrums' and 'hydranjers' are not
uncommon; as for the ginkgo tree, few can recognise it, let alone spell it.
Horticulture dictionaries are about as common as unicorns in most property
sales offices.
However, the garden is the frame of the house and often, if it is well
presented, it can catch the eye of a potential buyer. Where it is of
exceptional merit or historic interest it may be listed, in the same way as
important houses. And if it is one of the gems designed by Gertrude Jekyll,
it will certainly enjoy the protection of the law.
Jekyll, the myopic old lady whom Sir Edwin Lutyens referred to as 'Bumps',
was a genius of the garden; she could recognise a tree by the sound of the
leaves in the breeze. With Lutyens she formed an architectural/horticultural
team that may never be matched.
One of the finest examples of their collaboration is Fulbrook, high on the
brow of a hill a few miles from Farnham, with distant southerly views over
Sussex. The house was built in 1896 for Mrs Gerard Streatfield, in whose
family it stayed for nearly 70 years.
The 21-acre grounds include a fine terraced western hillside designed by
Jekyll; the dry stone walls are planted with sedums and campanulas. There is
also a trout lake, which the old lady would probably have liked; and a
helipad and floodlit tennis court, which she probably would not.
The house has 11 bedrooms plus an indoor swimming pool and billiards room.
It cost Pounds 10,000 to build nearly 100 years ago; the price now suggested
by Hamptons is 'in excess of Pounds 2.5m'.

FT  13 JUN 92 / Minding Your Own Business: Frivolity with discipline
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE emphasis that Emma Hope puts on discipline makes you wonder whether by
nature she is as whimsical as her shoes. But it has probably been her
saviour during the recession which has sent so many small businesses to the
wall.
Having started out with an order for 50 pairs of shoes in 1984, the
29-year-old designer now sells about 7,000 pairs a year and her annual
turnover ranges between Pounds 400,000 and Pounds 500,000.
To cope with the rapid expansion of her business, she has employed a
management consultant who comes in once a month to help her with the
accounts and stock control. 'Having someone to come in is a discipline,'
Emma says.
Increasingly difficult trading conditions have taught her to keep her eye
firmly on the business's bank balance.
'I always know how much money is in the bank,' she says. 'After all, if you
are not making a profit, you might as well do something else.'
The recession has instilled a healthy dose of caution in her. She will not
cut an order for shoes until she has received a deposit of 50 per cent of
its value, and she spends a large amount of her time getting references
about clients and chasing up confirmations on orders. Other precautionary
measures include keeping overheads as low as possible, not over-borrowing
('It's terribly easy to get a loan but so difficult to pay it back') and
making costings as high as possible.
But discipline would be a waste of time if it were not for the desirability
of Emma's shoes, for which women and men are willing to pay an average
Pounds 120-Pounds 130 a pair.
What makes her shoes for women so instantly recognisable are their
flattering, elongated line, the sculpted, Elizabethan look, and the
attention to detail. In her shop you can see purple velvet, embroidered
pumps, paillette-strewn court shoes in red, black and white, and black,
high-heeled shoes enlivened with a thick diamente strap across the front.
Her shoes for men are carefully welted and look as if they would last
forever.
Emma has carved a profitable niche for herself in the bridal shoe market.
She has created 15 styles - ranging from ivory silk shoes with roses in
peach silk to pumps embroidered with pearl beads - which roll over year
after year. 'Most women are only brides once, and they are not so conscious
of the price,' she explains. She sells about 2,000 pairs of bridal shoes a
year.
Emma learnt shoe-making at the Cordwainers College in London. She has never
had much trouble in drumming up business but she has had 'the most awful
disasters' in manufacturing the shoes.
Initially, she had to rely on one factory to cut the leather for the shoes,
one to sew them, and so on. 'It was all very stressful,' she recalls. Four
years ago, though, she found a small factory run by Greeks in the East End
of London where the shoes are made by hand. 'The quality is a lot better
because they are responsible for the whole product,' Emma says.
The downside is that she has to be really organised in getting all the
components together - most of them come from Italy - and in chasing up
orders.
The cost of making a shoe is half labour and half materials. But on top of
that are other costs, such as shop staff, which come to about Pounds 45,000
a year. Travelling to and attending trade fairs also is expensive and costs
about Pounds 15,000 a year. Emma designs two collections annually which she
shows at London's Olympia, Dusseldorf and New York.
Wholesale accounts for a large amount of Emma's business. Of her total
yearly production, 5,000 pairs are sold that way, half of them exported to
the US, Japan, Germany and Scandinavia. Her shoes are stocked by Harrods and
small boutiques in London as well as Barneys and Bergdorf Goodman, the New
York department stores.
Having her own shop has proved invaluable in spite of it being tucked away
in a quiet street in Islington, north London. The rent is much lower than
fashionable locations such as South Molton Street in the West End, and it
has enabled Emma to learn about all aspects of retailing from display to
stock control and credit card transactions.
'You also find out what sells and what doesn't,' she says, thanks to the
feedback from customers who come to the shop - something she gets rarely
from her wholesale clients. She is looking for a partner to finance a shop
in central London for which she would supply the shoes.
With the factory in the East End running at full capacity, Emma is looking
to expand production of women's shoes in Italy. She has embarked on a
licencing agreement for men's shoes with a factory in Northampton, under
which she will be responsible for design but the factory will produce the
shoes under her label and send them straight to clients.
Emma also plans to expand into leather goods, a natural progression from
shoes. She already has some great ideas for handbags - the sort that you can
fit A4 paper into and designed so that pens don't get lost at the bottom -
but she will not give away more than that.

FT  13 JUN 92 / As they say in Europe: Small crisis, no one hurt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES MORGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT WAS a week of unhappy marriages, uncaring spouses and old hatreds
rekindled. There was the familiar tale of the ignored junior partner making
the kind of fuss that sells newspapers. The Slovaks for years have
complained about their richer Czech brethren and last weekend voted for
separation, at least.
Headlines trumpeted the imminent end of the Czechoslovak state, but crises
in that country often mean a good deal less than meets the eye. It was,
after all, a 'massacre' in which nobody got killed that sparked off the
'velvet revolution' in which nobody got killed that led to the restoration
of democracy and the present difficulties.
Slovak editorials after the electoral triumph of the separatists did
notcelebrate the demise of the federal state. Narodna Obroda had the
headline: 'Keep to the constitution.' This stirring call to arms was
followed by a typical outburst of frenzied nationalism: 'In the interests of
Slovakia, it would be useful if the policy of the (victorious) HZDS party
were based on a positive position. Ability to understand the political
implications should be the main criterion for party leader Meciar when it
comes to the settlement of the key question of relations between Czechs and
Slovaks.'
Attention to boring minutiae is a key characteristic of Czechoslovakia. When
the communists were in control, there was an enormously popular radio show
where listeners answered abstruse questions relating to the law in spite of
its irrelevance under that political system.
My view that the state will hold together, because the negotiations on how
to split it up will last forever, is not shared widely. But, in this part of
the world, history hangs like a storm cloud over everything.
Outside Germany, nobody reported the traditional Whit Monday event there:
the Day of the Expellees. Every year, the victims and their descendants
gather to mourn the day of expulsion from the Czech Sudetenland in 1945. The
Sudeten Germans had welcomed Hitler's incorporation of the territory into
the Reich in 1938 which is why, even in Germany, their plight evokes little
sympathy.
Germany and Czechoslovakia have signed a treaty designed to heal the wounds
of the past and maintain the status quo, which is the last thing the
expellees want. At their rally, the premier of Bavaria, Max Streibl, said
his Land would not support the treaty which accepts the expulsion as legal.
It was, in fact, fairly horrible as Czech feelings were running high at the
time. Streibl was accompanied by the federal finance minister, Theo Waigel.
The expellees believe they deserve compensation, even the return of their
old homes.
The tone of this year's rally was not enhanced by attempts to improve
relations between Germany and Czechoslovakia. Fifty participants left the
hall when one speaker said that not only the expulsion, but also the horrors
of the Nazis, had to be recalled.
The Suddeutsche Zeitung, of Munich, said: 'The CSU politicians Streibl and
Waigel have rendered a disservice in their dismissive statements about the
treaty text which they regard as incomplete. They attack the government for
having made a mess of it, and accuse Prague of refusing to make a full
reassessment of the past. In the same breath, Streibl said he wanted good
relations with Czechoslovakia. But how can anybody trust such a statement
when relations are damaged by such Whitsun speeches?'
Neue Zeit, of Berlin, remarked that it was lucky Streibl had not spoken
before the Czechoslovak elections when he would have given the
'left-nationalists a few more votes.' That would be true in the Czech lands;
no German harbours resentment of the Slovaks, and vice versa, which could be
important one day. All this shows that no matter where it arises in Europe,
any problem is automatically a German problem.
But all is quiet on the western front. Page one of Le Parisien on Monday
carried the headline: 'It's new: The English love us.' The main evidence for
what was meant to be a shock-horror story was that The Times was running a
promotion offering readers cut-price French holidays and has tried to
impress on the British the delights not only of France, but also of the
French]
By Wednesday, Le Parisien was apologising to the Queen on her official visit
 -describing her programme as 'L'ennui distingue.'

FT  13 JUN 92 / The Hess secrets remain locked away: David Marsh on
questions new disclosures do not answer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE TWO men arrived at 1 pm on June 9 1941 to interview the prisoner in
Mytchett Place, a gloomy red-brick Victorian mansion near Aldershot. The
tall bushy-browed German, recently flown in from Augsburg, had been nervous
and depressed lately. Dressed carefully in his Luftwaffe uniform, he said he
was pleased to receive his visitors. 'I know that my arrival has not been
properly understood by anyone,' he said.
The prisoner was Rudolf Hess, the deputy Fuhrer of Nazi Germany. He had
parachuted out near the Duke of Hamilton's estate in Scotland a month
earlier from a Messerschmitt-110. He hoped to convince Britain to make
peace, leaving Hitler a free hand on the continent. After several years of
sliding from favour within the Nazi hierarchy, Hess wanted to show the
Fuhrer that he was still a man to be reckoned with. Hess was on the way to
making history, but not along the route he had in mind. The deputy Fuhrer's
road from Renfrewshire led not, as he had hoped, to Buckingham Palace and an
audience with the King, but to four decades of incarceration in Spandau
fortress in Berlin, where he died in 1987.
Hess's visitors in June 1941 were Sir John Simon, the Lord Chancellor, and
Ivone Kirkpatrick, a German expert attached to the political warfare
executive, who knew Hess from service in Britain's Berlin embassy before the
war. Simon, who had supported appeasement as foreign secretary in the
mid-1930s, had been chosen by Churchill to quiz Hess sympathetically. The
transcript of the rambling 2 1/2 hour session, released by the Foreign
Office on Wednesday as part of a belated Whitehall effort to reduce secrecy
over the Hess case, shows that Simon was - if nothing else - sympathetic. On
page 43 of the transcript, Simon tells Hess politely that he had been
waiting for two hours for Hess to tell him the reasons for his mission 'and
I haven't heard a word about it yet.'
Simon's lack of thrust as an interrogator was matched only by Hess's
inability to come to the point. Kirkpatrick, who had already had three
somewhat tiresome interviews with Hess, recorded that the event had been a
'Mad Hatter's tea party'. Eventually, Hess spelled out his peace offer -
'Germany's sphere of interest is Europe; England's sphere of interest is her
Empire'.
The next day, Simon wrote up for Churchill the result of his meeting on
House of Lords notepaper. Hess 'does not, apparently, know anything of
strategic plans,' Simon concluded, but his arrival might show that Germany
was more 'uneasy' about a long war than Hess himself had tried to pretend.
Five days after the interview, Hess attempted to commit suicide, or at
least, to draw attention to himself, by throwing himself down the Mytchett
Place stairs in the middle of the night.
The account of the Simon interview may have titillated news editors. But,
along with most of the other 900 pages of 'new' Hess papers, it added
nothing to previous analysis of the reasons for Hess's flight. The only
novelties were four pages of Hess farewell letters to his family and Hitler,
written on the eve of his apparent suicide attempt, and some hand-written
Hess annotations clearing up points in the Simon interview. Nearly
everything else had been published before.
The transcript of the Simon and Kirkpatrick interview was quoted in court by
Hess's defence at the Nuremberg tribunal in 1946, and was published with the
trial documents. The full Simon papers have all been available at the
Bodleian library in Oxford for more than a decade. The Foreign Office's
closed files on Hess have intrigued historians, sleuths and conspiracy
theorists for years. It is now apparent that a great deal could have been
laid bare far earlier without any conceivable harm to British interests.
The most interesting point about this week's publication was what was not
published. A number of questions remain: Was Hess lured to Britain through
an MI6 decoy mission, boosting his credulous belief that he would be
received by the King and allowed to make peace over Churchill's head? Did
British establishment figures compromise themselves by extending peace
feelers towards Germany in the months before his arrival? Did Hess give his
interrogators details of Operation Barbarossa, the forthcoming German attack
on the Soviet Union, of which Churchill already had forewarning through
decrypts of the German Enigma ciphers? Did Hess come with either the
blessing or the knowledge of Hitler? And was there anything in the conundrum
of May 1941 which might have led to British agents killing Hess in his cell
in Spandau in 1987, as his family and some German right-wingers claim?
Andrew Roberts, a historian who probed the Hess saga in The Holy Fox, his
recent biography of Chamberlain's foreign secretary, Lord Halifax, believes
that the answer to all the above questions is probably 'No.' But he says of
this week's publication: 'This is by no means the end of the affair'.
Some details may come to light in further Foreign Office files - a 1 ft high
stack of documents - due to be released during the next few weeks. Two files
on contemporary contacts between Germany and Spain are, for instance, still
being held back. These may include references to Britain's ambassador to
Madrid, Sir Samuel Hoare, thought to have played a part in encouraging
Berlin's hopes of peace with England. But the full story of any MI6
deception, along with the record of Hess's 1941 debriefings by intelligence
officers, are presumably still buried in separate, unpublished MI6 files. A
letter brought by Hess for the Duke of Hamilton, a blue-blooded RAF officer
and former Conservative MP, who was the first person formally to interview
him after his landing, has still not come to light. Neither have details of
previous correspondence to Hamilton from Albrecht Haushofer, a
well-connected Hess friend and Anglophile official from Berlin. Hamilton
refers, intriguingly, to an earlier letter from Haushofer in a report on his
interview with Hess released as part of this week's documents.
There are other missing links too. A full transcript of Kirkpatrick's
interviews with Hess is not available, although his summaries were released
this week. (Kirkpatrick had already written his account in a book published
in 1959.) There is no account of an apparent briefing with Hess by Desmond
Morton, Churchill's intelligence aide. In October 1941 Morton told a US
military intelligence chief that Hess gave warning of Hitler's June 22
attack on the Soviet Union. This may have been a piece of disinformation by
Morton, but, according to John Costello, the author who revealed the story
last year, 'Morton wasn't making this up.'
The notion that Hitler knew about Hess's mission seems unlikely. Hess's son,
Wolf-Rudiger, a businessman living near Munich, contends that Hess was
acting with Hitler's backing, and that both had agreed - in case the peace
initiative misfired - never to reveal the Fuhrer's approval. This is
far-fetched. Simon wrote in his report to Churchill that Hess was 'trying to
reproduce things Hitler has said to him about conditions of peace which
would satisfy Germany,' and that seems to have been the limit of the two
men's compliance.
Wolf-Rudiger's idee fixe - the subject of a best-selling book in Germany
since his father's death - is that Hess was murdered by the British to
prevent him spilling secrets once he was released from Spandau. But on the
evidence, this melancholy and confused man would not have had many secrets
to impart.
A postscript comes from Sir Frank Roberts, a former British ambassador to
Bonn, who visited Hess in Spandau and was a Foreign Office official during
the war. Sir Frank said this week that Hess came to Scotland because he was
'at a loose end . . . He had nothing to do with the running of the war.'
During his time in Spandau - and perhaps before - Hess 'cast himself in the
role of a martyr.' He lived to be a victim and, Sir Frank adds with Foreign
Office malice, 'If he had been released, he would probably have died the
next day.'

FT  13 JUN 92 / Finance and the Family (Briefcase): The dodgy lodger
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
IN 1980 I rented my property to a woman. One of the conditions on the signed
agreement was: 'not to sub-let, take in lodgers as paying guests and to use
the flat for residential purposes only'. A later signed rent agreement in
1991 said: 'not to assign, sub-let or allow any other person to reside in
the premises or to take in any lodgers'.
In 1988, her 50-year-old son, after his divorce, moved into the flat without
my knowledge. When I eventually found out, she assured me that it was only
temporary. I have continually told her that she only is the tenant and her
son should not be there. He is self-employed and although he keeps his van
elsewhere, his business address is the flat, where he does his paper-work
and telephoning. The rent is always in arrears. I do not want her son in my
property. What are my rights as a landlord? Can I legally move him out now?
As the son has now been in the property for some three or four years you may
have difficulty in enforcing the strict provisions of the letting agreement:
it can be argued that you have waived the apparent breach of covenant. You
will need to give the tenant notice to restore the position. This is a
complex area of the law and you would be wise to consult a solicitor.

<TEXT>
I AM the executor of a husband's simple will. Everything, including
properties in the sole name of the husband, is left to his wife. My
responsibility is to transfer all to the wife.
There are three properties which have been occupied by relatives for many
years, tax free and rent free.
The wife does not wish to become involved with the two properties. She wants
to gift them to the occupants.
After obtaining probate, can I transfer the two properties direct out of the
estate under the wife's instructions?
If I can do this:
1) Should I use the normal transfer form to convey Title?
2) Would any other documents be required?
3) As a safeguard for myself, what should I ask the wife (sole beneficiary)
to sign?
You would need to execute an asset, in writing, to the wife and then have
her execute a normal transfer to the tenants. It may be wise to ensure that
the wife has independent legal advice before she makes a gift in this way to
the tenants, so that she may be advised of the financial and tax
consequences eg. the liability to inheritance tax, or absorption of part of
her nil rate band allowance.

FT  13 JUN 92 / Finance and the Family (Briefcase): Taking control of
Father's finances
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MY FATHER, who is 87 and lives alone, is gradually becoming less able to
manage his affairs. He has, for instance, recently sold for a nominal sum
various antiques, including some furniture, to dealers who made a casual
call to his house. He has no record of the transaction, no name or address
of the dealer and no means of recovering his property. There are many other
examples of his inability to deal with his personal finances and he claims
to have lost various sums of cash from his money belt while out shopping.
I believe it is now necessary to supervise his financial affairs. What would
need to be done to be done to arrange this? For instance, how would I go
about securing a power of attorney?
I also believe that the time is approaching for him to consider a move to
supervised accommodation. Who should I contact for information on private
and local authority homes and how should I pay for their services?
You may need to obtain an Enduring Power of Attorney, if your father is
still capable of executing a legal document such as that. You should consult
the social services department in his local authority for the information
which you require. If you obtain an Enduring Power of Attorney you must see
that it is registered as soon as possible.

FT  13 JUN 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Taxmen clamp down on holiday lettings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARBARA ELLIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TAX inspectors are clamping down on the generous tax breaks for letting
holiday homes. No cases have yet reached court but the scale of the battle
is clear.
Several breaks were allowed in an attempt to boost tourism in the 1980s. One
allows losses on holiday lets to be offset against the owner's income. But
there are a number of strict conditions; for example, the property must be
available for commercial letting to the public as holiday accommodation for
at least 140 days in a 12-month period, and the letting period must be for
at least 70 days.
Losses are incurred easily in a time of high interest rates and recession,
but the Inland Revenue does not seem to take this into account when deciding
if the letting is 'commercial.'
Definitions of this term have sometimes been narrowed to the point where
some taxpayers were told they were not trading commercially since they did
not show a profit in their first year. This meant being stripped of all the
benefits of special treatment, including unlimited mortgage interest relief
on the property.
Accountant BDO Binder Hamlyn has had a lot of trouble with loss-making
holiday lettings, according to personal tax partner Andrew Tappin. He
detects a hardening Revenue attitude. 'They are saying that if a profit is
not made within a couple of years, then, by definition, the business cannot
be operating on a commercial basis and, therefore, the special reliefs and
rules do not apply. It's against the spirit of the rules.'
Tappin has had to argue very strongly with inspectors in several disputes.
And he warns: 'It is important to show you have thought about making a go of
letting before you started. Lay the groundwork. Have some figures ready
showing what rents you think you can get and how many weeks you can let
for.'
He believes the Revenue's real aim in tightening up is to stop people
abusing the rules by borrowing up to the hilt to buy a retirement or second
home and taking what lettings they can get with no prospect of getting into
profit for five or 10 years.
'The trouble is, it is time-consuming to argue and expensive if you have
professional advisers,' Tappin says. 'The Revenue not infrequently wins the
day because the taxpayer just gives up.'
At another accountant, Glazers, partner Russell Black said one inspector had
defined 'commercial' explicitly as 'profitable.' Black added: 'He was really
saying you that can't have relief for a loss because you haven't made a
profit. If there is a provision for relief of losses, it must be possible
for a commercial operation to make a loss.'
Black suggested that in the absence of any case law on the subject, much
could depend on individual inspectors, although profitability by the second
or third year seemed to be considered acceptable.
Accountant Robson Rhodes is arguing with an inspector who has questioned the
status of a Suffolk country cottage which has shown losses on holiday
letting for the past three years.
'The client has tried to carry on the business with a view to
commerciality,' said the firm's tax manager, Martin Sands. 'The Revenue
stance is that the income that could be obtained must have been known at the
outset and, because expenditure has exceeded income by a substantial amount,
the place could never have been let on a commercial basis.'
Sands noted that while the Revenue had been happy to accept the first three
years' losses - which it was not seeking to alter - it now was taking a much
tougher line. In reply, the firm was putting forward proof that the client
was doing his best to trade commercially by cutting back spending on
improvements or replacement furniture.
A Revenue spokesman denied there was any special drive against holiday
home-owners. He referred to tax law specifying that loss relief in the first
four years 'shall not be given unless the trade (letting) is carried on a
commercial basis and in such a way that the profits . . . can reasonably be
expected to be realised in the period (of assessment) or within a reasonable
time thereafter.' No definition of 'reasonable' is supplied.
In later years, he said, relief would not be allowed unless the letting was
'on a commercial basis and with a view to the realisation of profits in the
trade.' He added: 'Inspectors would look for a person running a letting as a
business to produce commercial projections of the sort they would need if
getting a loan to set up a business.' Otherwise, he suggested, owners might
well be trying to subsidise their own holiday home or use the tax privileges
to finance property bought for investment.
As for the recession, he noted: 'Inspectors will be aware of the general
economic conditions. The law is there, it has not changed, and inspectors
need to apply the law as it stands.'

FT  13 JUN 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Keep that junk mail pouring in - Diary
of a Private Investor / The postman slways knocks twice for Kevin
Goldstein-Jackson
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN GOLDSTEIN-JACKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'DEAR Mr Goldstein-Jackson, You have been elected a nominee for a rare
honour. I am delighted to be the one to congratulate you on your nomination
election for the MOST ADMIRED MAN OF THE DECADE.'
Thus began a letter I recently received from the American Biographical
Institute, based in Raleigh, North Carolina, which pointed out that 'to be
'most admired' is one of the highest accolades given to an individual'.
I had been nominated for the award 'following a vote by inter-continental
representatives' of the Institute's Board of International Research who had
selected a 'small number of men' for their 'influence, fame or ideas that
have had visible impact on professions and communities'.
Unfortunately, my nomination had an expiry date of June 12 and to 'certify'
my election I would have pay Dollars 195 (Pounds 107) as a 'contribution fee
towards all crafting processes' in producing a proclamation 'done in two
striking ink colours' plus 'hand lettering' by a 'scribe'. For Dollars 250 I
could have, instead, a proclamation 'custom laminated on to Finland
birchwood'.
I decided not to accept this 'rare' honour in the hope that someone might
nominate me for a 'columnist of the year' award, or maybe even a knighthood
or a CBE instead.
The institute's letter was just one of the many unsolicited junk mail
offerings which pour through my letter-box every week.
As a private investor who has subscribed to Business Expansion Schemes,
bought privatisation-issued shares, holds a number of credit cards and owns
a number of insurance policies, as well as being a donor to charity, I
appear to be on a considerable number of mailing lists.
Somewhat surprisingly, I find much of the junk mail quite entertaining -
even the numerous issues from Reader's Digest inviting me to participate in
various prize draws.
However, it is the financial junk mail that fascinates me the most.
Companies still seem to be falling over themselves to lend money to my
family.
My wife has been offered 'up to Pounds 10,000 to spend as you wish' by RAC
personal loans, which offered her a 'free Pounds 30 bonus' if she took out a
loan. As an RAC member she 'automatically qualified' for 'competitive
terms'.
But why would she (or anyone else, for that matter) want to borrow from the
RAC at an APR of 29.9 per cent for a loan of up to Pounds 2,500 and 27.9 per
cent for loans over Pounds 2,500 when they can probably get, say, an
unsecured loan of Pounds 10,000 from Barclays Bank for 23.4 per cent APR? Or
 -better still, depending on individual circumstances - pay actual interest
of 12.7 per cent by increasing their mortgage with a home-owner loan from
Barclays? Why pay high interest rates to lenders which have to charge such
rates partly because of their high number of defaulters?
Other banks and institutions offer a wide variety of low-cost loans such as
Lloyds Gold Service at 15.3 per cent APR. It obviously pays to shop around
rather than respond immediately to 'competitive terms' through the mail.
One of the benefits of all the financial regulatory organisations is the
increased amount of information which approved organisations have to give
potential clients. However, they differ widely on how they present certain
information.
For example, I recently received in the post details of the Norwich Union
Supersaver with profits savings plan. This offered 'automatic acceptance for
a big cash payout', without the need for a medical and offered a variety of
free gifts - ranging from a matching three-piece luggage set to a radio
alarm clock.
Norwich Union provided a clearly set out table illustrating the effects of
early surrender for a variety of age groups and monthly premiums.
clear. My wife received a mailshot from Bristol and West about a 10-year
endowment savings plan with Eagle Star. The surrender examples were only for
males aged 35 and 45 and paying Pounds 15 per month or Pounds 50 a month.
The cash amount of surrender value was given, but not the total paid in
premiums.
For example, it stated that a man aged 35 paying Pounds 50 per month would
possibly receive Pounds 3,310 if he surrendered the policy at the end of
year five. The reader had to calculate himself how much he would have paid
in premiums by that time (Pounds 3,000).
Friends Provident, in a recent mailing, offered a 10-year Maxima Savings
Plan, and gave just three examples of ages (males aged 25, 40 and 65) and
only one example of contributions (an initial Pounds 10 per month) but at
least stated the total amount of contributions paid by surrender date.
Far too many people are still taking out long-term policies and then finding
they either cannot continue with the monthly payments or, perhaps, are
persuaded by certain 'advisers' to cash in their policies in favour of
another company's product.
In some cases this may well be justified by the better financial performance
of the new company, but in others it may just be the result of an 'adviser'
wanting to gain lucrative commission.
Perhaps the 'surrender value' statements for insurance companies should be
prefaced by a statement, similar to that required for cigarette
advertisements, stating: 'IF YOU STOP YOUR POLICY EARLY YOU COULD LOSE LOTS
OF YOUR MONEY.'
Personal Equity Plan managers are another source of large amounts of junk
mail. Sometimes I wonder why people who only make capital gains from shares
of a few thousand pounds a year - well within their tax-free capital gains
allowances - bother to take out Peps when, if they had invested such modest
sums directly in shares instead they would have achieved tax-free capital
gains anyway.
True, within a Pep, the dividends are not subject to tax, providing they
remain for investment purposes within the plan, but much of this income will
be eaten up by the plan's management fee.
One area of financial mailshots that I feel ought to be encouraged is
promotion of individual companies for investment. I have already received
three separate letters from Wellcome concerning its forthcoming offer of
shares. It would be nice to receive details of other individual companies
which want to increase the numbers of their private shareholders.
It ought to be possible for a company to write to me even when it is not
having a share offer, pointing out its track record and financial prospects
and encouraging me to contact my stockbroker or other suitable adviser to
seek advice on buying its shares.
If you want to increase the amount of junk mail you receive, you can request
a form from the Mailing Preference Service, Freepost 22, London W1E 7EZ and
indicate on that form their special interests: financial, sporting, home and
leisure, and so on. The service has around 10,000 names on file of people
who have asked to receive more junk mail.
If you want to receive less junk mail, write to the same address to request
its members to remove your name from their mailing lists. Last year, about
95,000 people made such a request but I shall continue to look forward to
the post.

Transactions
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES in Transfer Technology, formerly called Central and Sheerwood, are
rediscovering territory last charted in 1987 when they hit the equivalent of
Pounds 11.
In May the company announced a 1 for 2 rights issue to raise Pounds 24m,
part of which is to be used to fund three acquisitions.
Geoffrey Robinson, the chairman and largest shareholder on the board, sold
1.57m nil paid shares at an 80p premium. That figure represents his entire
rights entitlement.
Neil Logue, finance director, sold 70,000 ordinary ex-right shares together
with a further 35,000 of the nil paid, leaving him with 9,600 ordinary
shares.
Richard Chalcraft, chief executive of the regional housebuilder, Edmond
Holdings, has been selling more stock. A total of 600,000 shares were
disposed of at prices between 43p and 43.5p. Since the announcement of final
results in March, Chalcraft has sold a total of 1.25m shares, reducing his
holding to just over 7m.
Lord Macfarlane, chairman of the eponymous Scottish packaging company, sold
250,000 shares at 191.5p - the first shares he has sold for some time.
At Enterprise Computer Holdings, the arrival of four new faces on the board
coincided with three of them buying shares.
The buyers include the new chairman and the new chief executive. Robert
Evans has left the company, but not before making significant profits on the
shares he bought last year at prices between 8p and 15p.

FT  13 JUN 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: 'Endowment trust' launch
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IF YOU thought you had seen the most complicated product the financial
services industry had to offer, prepare to be amazed.
Next month, Kleinwort Benson will launch an investment trust which invests
in second-hand with-profits endowment policies. It aims to compete with
zero-dividend investment trust preference shares.
Confused? You need not be.
The Kleinwort Endowment Policy Trust (Kept) should do a simple job for
investors - over 11 years it should deliver a solid capital gain. It is not
planning to pay any dividends. No income tax is payable, so it will appeal,
like zeros, to top-rate taxpayers who pay no capital gains tax.
The trust's fund will invest only in second-hand endowment policies (Sheps),
together with some cash. The supply of Sheps comes, in particular, from
distressed homeowners who give up on the endowments they were using to pay
the mortgage - KB estimates the policies surrendered each year amount to
Pounds 1bn.
If homeowners 'surrender' their policy to the life office, they receive a
paltry sum compared with the value which has already accrued. This opens the
way to make a market - distressed policyholders can get a better rate from a
marketmaker, who makes a profit by selling the policy to someone else, who
pays the remaining premiums and receives the maturity value.
The market has grown, boosted by wider awareness of Sheps' possibilities.
But it is hard to find a Shep for the price you want to pay, and valuation
requires actuarial formulae which few can take on unaided. Hence the demand
for a collective fund. Endowments are long-term and illiquid, so an
open-ended fund, such as a unit trust, seems unworkable. Investment trusts
are preferable.
KB's trust will have an 11-year life. It aims to buy its endowments during
its first year and to use some cash from the launch to pay premiums on the
policies until the end of year two. From then on, premiums from the
remaining policies will be paid for out of the proceeds of endowments as
they mature within the fund.
The Sheps will mature in the trust's final year, and the capital will be
distributed to shareholders. It has the simplicity of a unitised fund,
combined with all the reassuring qualities of with-profits investment.
So could things go wrong?
With-profits policies cannot go down in value. Instead, 'reversionary'
bonuses - which once awarded cannot be taken away - are added each year
together with a terminal bonus when the policy matures.
But they are not risk-free. The amount of bonuses added can be reduced, so
the policy can do worse than expected.
Bonuses are under severe pressure and 1992 has seen sweeping cuts for short
term policies, although 25-year policies have been less affected.
Kept hopes to avoid some of these problems by investing in the large
long-term policies which are least popular with private investors. It also
has a deal with Surrenda-Link, a marketmaker, which it hopes will ensure
that it can buy policies at healthy discounts.
But low inflation and low interest rates will put further pressure on
bonuses. KB says that if both reversionary and terminal bonuses fall 20 per
cent over the next 11 years then the gross redemption yield (the growth
received each year over the life of the trust) will be 10.2 per cent.
Greater bonus cuts would mean a lower yield.
Then there is the discount risk. The underlying portfolio is secure, but the
value you receive if you sell your shares within the 11 years is determined
by market forces.
Kleinwort says the shares can be regarded as zeros, most of which now
actually trade at a premium, but analysts seem unhappy to go this far. Nigel
Sidebottom, of Gerrard Vivian Gray, calls Kept a 'quasi-zero', because it
lacks the cover of a zero, but is less risky than most equity investments.
Other analysts concur.
That, hopefully, will mean that the shares do not sink to a discount, but
the risk is still there. Doubts also remain about the market for Sheps,
where demand far outstrips supply. The advent of a big new buyer can only
exacerbate this. However, the ingenuity of this genuinely innovative product
cannot be faulted. The full prospectus will be available in July.

FT  13 JUN 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: China's internal reforms hold key to
long-term prospects - Investing in . . . Hong Kong / John Authers argues
that it might not yet be time to sell
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IS IT time to sell Hong Kong? Common sense suggests that it must be. The
Hang Seng index, which measures the Hong Kong market's performance, has
risen 64 per cent over the past year, and 40.3 per cent this year alone.
Last week it broke through the 6,000 barrier, having stood at only 3,004 at
the beginning of last year. These figures have the look of a peak about
them. Then, too, the political risk which lurks once China's leader Deng
Xiaoping dies scarcely inspires hope for sustained strong rises.
For once, professional fund managers in the area seem to agree with the
layman's view - few of them are happy to predict continued growth on
anything like this scale. But that does not necessarily mean that the time
has come to sell. And political developments could yet leave the Hong Kong
market looking attractive.
What has fuelled the recent performance? There seem to be two main reasons.
The China factor.
For a year or so after the Tiananmen Square massacre in Beijing, exposure to
China was a thoroughly negative influence on the Hong Kong market. But the
shock of Tiananmen has worn off while China's economy has grown strongly.
Economic, if not political, reform seems well entrenched. The need for it is
not disputed by top Chinese officials, giving observers hope that it will
survive the present leader, Deng Xiaoping.
Pamela Chan, manager of Sun Life's recently-launched Pacific Growth unit
trust, points to a front page editorial in the state-owned People's Daily:
'Reform and opening up  .. is our only choice.' The word 'capitalism' is
even being used by communist leaders, she says.
Hong Kong has high exposure to Guangdong province, which neighbours it on
the Chinese mainland. Growth there last year was 13.5 per cent, almost twice
the national average. While that level is not sustainable indefinitely, many
believe in China's capacity for growth for years to come.
All of this has eroded what analysts call Hong Kong's 'China discount.' What
was perceived as the political risk posed by China's takeover in five years
meant that investors were prepared to buy Hong Kong shares only at a low
rating, in terms of price-earnings ratio, compared with the rating of
companies in other Pacific economies.
The positive signs coming out of China have eroded most of that discount.
According to Datastream, the historic p/e ratio on the Hang Seng index
dropped to 8.9 in the weeks following Tiananmen but now stands at 16.2,
having been only 12.7 at the beginning of this year. Hong Kong is now almost
in line with other Pacific economies, although ratios are still below the
headier heights of 1987.
If you agree with this argument, there is no reason to expect the market to
endure a cyclical fall. It has simply enjoyed a re-rating in response to new
data. But this argument also points to slower market growth in future.
China's development must be swift indeed to see the discount eroded much
more in the next few years.
Interest rates.
In real terms, Hong Kong credit is absurdly cheap. While inflation hovers
around double figures, overnight bank lending rates are only around 2 per
cent. There is no rationale for this within the colony's economy. Interest
rates are pegged at this level only because the Hong Kong dollar is tied to
the US dollar. Thus, base rates have had to follow US rates downwards to
stop traders profiting from 'arbitrage.'
Unsurprisingly, the Hong Kongese are not very interested in saving at
present - the rate they earn on deposit is barely half that of inflation.
But the property market has had a jamboree, which the government is trying
to dampen. Not only are loans cheap but residents also are desperate to gain
a hedge against inflation, which property traditionally can be expected to
provide. Equities also have benefited from this bizarre set of
circumstances. While interest rates stay unnaturally low, strong growth in
property and equity prices should continue.
Underlying corporate earnings also have been fuelled by the credit boom, as
people have spent to consume rather than save. If forecasts for final-year
earnings are correct, then there is still value in the market, with
prospective ratings of around 11.5, and this effect has not been played out
fully. But KC Lee, Hong Kong-based fund manager with Fidelity, offers a
warning. 'At some time, Hong Kong will have to pay a price for what is going
on. We can't have a system which discourages savings without a price being
paid.'
It is possible to view this more optimistically - for example, Chan says
that the island should benefit from a US recovery and forecasts earnings per
share growth for 1992 of 24 per cent - but the interest rate effect must be
a reason to expect a slow-down in the market before long. So, any investment
judgment on the Hong Kong economy must be balanced finely.
Both China and interest rate policies have been positive factors over the
past year. The former should continue to fuel growth for many years  -
although the possibility China could lose its Most Favoured Nation trading
status with the US would dent this. The latter is unlikely to remain
suppositive for many more months. The result is reflected in fund managers'
allocation decisions. Most are still overweight in Hong Kong, but their
weightings have been cut slightly and are likely to be cut further. It is
still not time to sell Hong Kong in a big way.
Working out how to assess a Hong Kong weighting is difficult enough, as
differing accounting standards, combined with restrictions on foreign
investment, make it very hard to compare the size of the different Pacific
markets.
Bruce Seton, Hong Kong manager with Gartmore, says that in market
capitalisation Hong Kong should take about 57 per cent of the Pacific Basin
market. But doubts about the best way to measure this mean that Gartmore
treats 50 per cent as a 'neutral' weighting for Hong Kong - almost exactly
its present level.
Sun Life's Pacific fund has a 49 per cent weighting in Hong Kong, compared
with a projected weighting of 36 per cent when it was launched. Fidelity's
Far East Excluding Japan fund now has a weighting of 48 per cent in Hong
Kong and Lee says he expects the weighting to be lower six months from now.
Thus, Far East Excluding Japan funds are arguably the most prudent way to
buy exposure to Hong Kong.
If, however, you are convinced about long-term Chinese economic reform, you
could try a Hong Kong unit trust. There are five - from Gartmore, Commercial
Union, INVESCO, Providence Capitol and James Capel - and they are the top
performers of all unit trusts over the past year, having logged rises
varying from Gartmore's 93.8 per cent to Capel's 37.5 per cent.
These funds are definitely not for the risk-averse. But Chris Mitchell, of
CU, tells why they might appeal. 'I think the full potential of China is
greatly under-estimated. About 35 per cent of dollars earned are just being
saved in southern China at present because they have nothing to spend it on.
But the spending power is very like Japan.'

<TEXT>
BET, the business services conglomerate, is likely to report pre-tax profits
sharply down on Monday at about Pounds 110m after an extremely tough year in
joinery, personnel and plant hire. The market is expecting a halved
full-year dividend. Exceptional charges could be as much as double analysts'
highest expectations of about Pounds 50m.
The electricity utilities results season begins in earnest with three of the
regional supply companies and one generator set to report substantially
increased profits. On Monday, analysts expect East Midlands Electricity to
announce a historic cost pre-tax profit of around Pounds 145m, up 37 per
cent.
Norweb, expected to show the biggest rise in profits of the 12 regional
companies, reports on Tuesday. Its profit is expected to more than double to
Pounds 128m. On the same day, National Power, the largest privatised
generator, should announce a profit of around Pounds 510m, from Pounds 434m
last year. On Thursday, Manweb's is expected to increase by around 75 per
cent to Pounds 95m.
Severn Trent, the only privatised water and sewage company to report next
week, is likely to reveal a 6 per cent increase in annual pre-tax profits to
Pounds 263m. Although profits from water and sewage are expected to be well
ahead, attention will focus on Biffa, the waste management company acquired
last year from BET for Pounds 212m.
Hazlewood Foods, the Derby-based food manufacturer, is expected to reveal
flat profits of between Pounds 50m and Pounds 52m for the year to March 31
in its results on Tuesday. This is in spite of the Pounds 34.7m agreed offer
for its rival Sutherland at the end of July. Cable and Wireless, the
UK-based international telecommunications group, is expected to announce on
Wednesday that pre-tax profits for the year end to March increased from
Pounds 609m to Pounds 640. However, a higher tax charge is likely to be
primarily responsible for a slight fall in earnings per share.

FT  13 JUN 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Pensions: learning the lessons of
Maxwell - Norma Cohen and John Authers on developments in the pensions
scandal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN and JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PUBLIC outrage over the plight of 20,000 Maxwell company pensioners has
spurred the UK government into a wide-ranging review of pensions law.
For the average occupational scheme member, any changes to pension laws
could be of vital concern to beneficiaries. Most significantly, Peter
Lilley, social security secretary, said that the review will focus on the
thorniest issue in pension law - the ownership and control of pension scheme
assets. This means that the use of scheme surpluses, the biggest bone of
contention between employers and employees, should get a full hearing.
While employers have long taken the view that surpluses are the result of
over-generous contributions to schemes in earlier years, recent court
rulings have been more ambiguous. The present position is particularly
galling for members of contributory schemes who have contributed, on
average, a third of the pension fund's capital but are not given the option
of a contributions holiday in line with that of their employer.
Also, the review will consider whether schemes should be required to have
beneficiaries or independent parties represented on trustee boards. Their
presence could encourage some schemes to share surpluses more fully with
beneficiaries.
There is no guarantee that the independent commission will urge any major
overhaul of pension law. Any change would provoke fierce opposition from key
sectors. Recently, the 100 Group of Finance Directors, an influential group
of Britain's largest companies, surveyed its members and found that most
were threatening to reduce scheme contributions if limits were placed on
their ability to extract surplus.
Meanwhile, scheme members watching the government's half-hearted Pounds 2.5m
donation to the Maxwell pensioners may take some comfort from knowing that
the creation of a pensions safety net will also be under review. A
compulsory compensation scheme could help ease the fears of those concerned
about their schemes.
However, it is not clear that the review will answer the most common
questions raised by scheme members. According to the Occupational Pensions
Advisory Service, the most frequent query comes from those who believe that
their former employer has understated the transfer value of their pension.
One of Maxwell's most unfortunate legacies is to have encouraged people to
transfer out of good company schemes without realising how bad these
transfer values can be.
How can you spot potential misuse of your pension fund? Actuaries at Noble
Lowndes suggest that you start by finding out about the trustees:
Is there employee or trade union representation?
Is there an independent professional trustee?
Are the trustees all directors of the company?
You should read all the information you are sent, which should soon reveal
if something is amiss. Noble Lowndes suggests you look for the following:
The latest audited accounts and report to members - particularly those from
auditors and actuaries.
Reports on investments. Are the top ten investment holdings in companies in
big reputable companies, or have you never heard of them?
Are significant amounts of funds invested in the employing company, or lent
back to it?
Are investments concentrated in a small number of shares?
If the actuarial valuation says the fund is in deficit, what plans are there
to remedy it?
Finally, if the trustees do not give you the information you want, contact
OPAS on 071-233-8080, which can if necessary refer your complaint to the
Pensions Ombudsman. The name of a solicitor with pensions knowledge can be
obtained from the Association of Pension Lawyers on 071-628-9151.
Crooks like Robert Maxwell are not common. It would have paid to transfer
money out of a Maxwell scheme and into a personal pension, but low transfer
values mean that this should be regarded as an extreme step.
If you are very worried, then it probably makes more sense to find a new job
 -it is a crushing vote of no confidence in an employer to leave its pension
scheme, according to Alan Jenkinson of Noble Lowndes.
Putting your eggs in other baskets almost always makes good financial sense.
That means cutting your contributions to the minimum allowable, and then
funding a free-standing Additional Voluntary Contribution up to the maximum.
This will be managed by an independent insurance company or fund manager.
Then, if some of your pay is not pensionable, or if you have regular
freelance income, you could take out a personal pension on top of the
company plan. This area is complex, so take legal advice, but personal
pensions are generally better than AVCs because you can take a lump sum on
retirement, while the whole of an AVC has to buy an annuity.
But all of these are stop-gaps. Pension law reform - when, and if, it
happens - should remove some of the risks.

FT  13 JUN 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Fidelity's charge cuts stir the Pep
pot
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PERSONAL equity plans are one of the most tax-efficient ways to invest - but
efficiency does not come cheaply.
People can invest Pounds 6,000 in a general Pep in the tax year with a
further Pounds 3,000 in a single company Pep. A married couple could shelter
Pounds 18,000 each year in Peps and pay neither income tax nor capital gains
tax on the returns.
These benefits have to be balanced against the relatively high charges
usually imposed by companies running the Peps.
Mindful of this, Fidelity Investments is cutting its initial charge on its
unit trust Peps from Monday. It will fall from 5.25 per cent to 2 per cent
while annual management fees of 1 per cent to 1.5 per cent, depending on the
fund, remain unaltered. There will be no VAT on the initial charge.
Instead Fidelity will be the first to impose an exit charge on a unit trust
Pep. This will be 3 per cent in the first year, 2 per cent in the second and
1 per cent in the third. There will be no withdrawal charges after that.
Under current rules unit trusts cannot impose an exit fee but there is less
control under Pep regulations.
Barry Bateman, managing director of Fidelity, acknowledged that high initial
charges dilute the tax benefits. He said the new charging structure
recognised the importance of Peps as a 'popular and mainstream product' best
used for long term savings.
BESt Investment, which publishes Best PEP Advice and Best PEP Selections,
calculates that the total cost of a Fidelity Pep is 7 to 8.8 per cent
depending on the fund. Cheaper unit or investment trust Peps are offered by
Ivory &amp; Sime, Dunedin, Lloyds, Foreign &amp; Colonial and Equitable.
Fidelity has lost market share in Peps, from 4.4 per cent of the market from
April 1990-91 to 2.2 per cent in 1991-92. Bateman acknowledged: 'We did not
perform as well as we would like to have done in 1991.' He was pleased with
performance this year.
Fidelity's unit trust performance was dented last year. Its Special
Situations UK growth fund, still an outstanding performer over 10 years,
ranked second in its sector, had been losing money over the past three
years. It was ranked 108 out of 125 to the beginning of this month,
according to Finstat. It has improved over the past six months to be ranked
10.
'Clearly, Fidelity felt it had to do something dramatic,' said John Spiers,
of BESt Investment. He said investors should be guided by the fund
management record and should remember that good performance outweighs lower
charges in the long run.
However, Roz Barder, of Chase de Vere, which produces Pepguide, said that
Fidelity's aggressive fund management style meant that 'if the market
performs badly, their funds tend to nose-dive but on the other hand they
tend to recover more quickly.'
The last five years have been bad for the unit trust industry. The market
crash of October 1987 and high real interest rates meant that returns were
outperformed by banks and building societies. Someone who invested Pounds
1,000 would have only made Pounds 156 in the average unit trust over the
past five years to May and would have lost money in the past year, according
to Money Management.
Fidelity's move adds another element of competition to the unit trust
industry. In February, Murray Johnstone cut the initial charge on all its
unit trusts from 5 to 1 per cent, but increased its annual management fee
from 1 per cent to 1.5 per cent. Gartmore eliminated the initial charge on
its UK Index Fund last month.
Fidelity is keeping up the 3 per cent commission it pays to financial
advisers. It is relying on the annual management charge to produce stable
income. Fidelity is also introducing a savings plan for its Peps and
allowing variable lump sum contributions and facilities to switch in and out
of funds.

FT  13 JUN 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Trusts can help to cut the risk
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
INVESTORS for income on the stock market would be well advised to dilute
their risk through a collective fund such as a unit or investment trust
rather than to try individual share-picking.
As discussed in the article above, investors who go hunting for high
yielding shares are engaged in a risky business because their chosen
companies might cut dividends or, in the worst case, even collapse. But
dividend cuts in shares held by a collective fund will have a less
pronounced effect on investors because of their wide spread.
There are more than 100 income funds to choose from in the UK equity income
unit trust sector, and six in the high income sector of investment trusts.
For inclusion, a unit trust must have a yield above 110 per cent of the
yield of the FT All-Share index; for investment trusts, the figure is 125
per cent.
Unit trust income funds have done well over the long term, even
outperforming the growth sector over periods from three to 10 years if
income is re-invested. But the growth in distributions has fallen since the
recession began and has barely increased over the past year. Many fund
managers have adopted a defensive strategy.
Most unit trusts pay out income every six months, but there are many that
pay at quarterly intervals. These include Newton's Income fund, which is top
of the sector over a period of three, five and seven years to June.
Its manager, Jonathan Powell, says his priority is to guard the capital by
buying companies with strong balance sheets rather than chasing income with
companies on high yields. He has put food firms, utilities and
pharmaceuticals as well as convertibles into the fund.
'These companies won't be cutting dividends but they won't be raising them,
either,' he says.
The Buckmaster Income fund, which has been a consistently good performer
over to seven years in the year to June, distributes every six months but
its High Income fund pays out every month. The initial charge on the High
Income fund is 3 per cent instead of the industry norm of 5.25 per cent, but
the minimum investment is Pounds 10,000 compared with Pounds 500 for the
Income portfolio.
Alternatively, investors can choose to buy into a number of good-quality
unit trusts with different distribution dates. Selecting two which pay at
different six-monthly intervals would ensure quarterly dividends for the
investor, but this steady flow of income would have to be balanced against
paying two lots of front-end charges.
Investors worried about the future of unit trust income funds can take heart
from Chris Rodgers, manager of the Schroder Income fund. He argues that
although dividend growth has slowed this year, the market thought dividends
would come under threat last year; thus, it has fallen already in response
to this expectation. So, he expects this year to be better than last for
income funds.
He is also running the fund defensively by targeting companies with
middle-range yields of about 7 per cent. These include, P&amp;O, ICI, British
Gas, Rank, Scottish Power, Shell and BAT.
Investors who are seeking income above a combination of income and capital
growth over the longer term would, however, be better off at the moment to
hold bonds rather than equities. Long-dated gilts are yielding more than 9
per cent and are expected to run into double figures over the couple of
years, compared with a yield of 4.5 per cent in the stock market and an
inflation rate of 4 per cent.
Other products designed to produce income include National Savings' income
bonds, which pay a variable rate of interest at monthly intervals. The rate
on a minimum deposit of Pounds 2,000 is now 10.25 per cent.
The life industry also has a number of products geared towards producing
income. Guaranteed income bonds pay a fixed rate of interest at regular
intervals. The rate depends on the amount invested and the length of time
the capital is to be tied up, usually one to five years.
Annuities also pay a fixed sum regularly, sometimes over a specified period
(temporary annuity) or until death (immediate annuity). Effectively, a large
part of the return is the repayment of the capital. Single premium insurance
bonds also can be used to produce income because investors can withdraw 5
per cent of the original value of the investment tax-free each year.
There is no prospect of capital growth with annuities, NS income bonds and
guaranteed income bonds. Similarly, the capital value of income shares of
investment trusts dwindles as trusts move towards their expiry date.
Perhaps the greatest attraction of equity investment for income is the
possibility of capital growth along with regular income payments.

FT  13 JUN 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Dividend growth withers in recession's
cold wind - Scheherazade Daneshkhu reports that investors are finding it
increasingly hard to maintain good returns from traditional high yield
stocks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MANY shareholders rely on dividends for income, but the recession is taking
its toll on company profits and, in turn, on dividend growth. On Thursday,
Pilkington announced a cut in its final dividend, the first since it went
public in 1970. Blue chip companies such as Trafalgar House, Asda, Vickers,
Lonrho and British Aerospace have all been forced to cut their dividends and
other companies are under pressure to do the same. There is even a question
aboutthe ability of British Steel, a stock traditionally held for income, to
maintain its final dividend when it reports its results later this month.
Unit trust income funds have managed very small rises over the past few
years; the average income fund has risen in value by only 0.4 per cent over
the year to June, and by 7.5 per cent over three years. And it is becoming
harder for investors to maintain a high return from traditional high yield
stocks. High yielding stocks are now perceived to be the ones in potential
trouble and at greatest risk of cutting dividends or keeping them static.
'Yield has become more a measure of risk relative to return,' says Bill
Smith, head of UK research at BZW.
The yield of a share is the dividend expressed as a percentage of a share
price. If share prices fall while dividends are constant, the yield will
rise. So, if a stock is high yielding stock with a low price its share price
hasalmost certainly declined. Unusually, the market prices have not risen in
line with dividends and the yield is now higher than the rate of inflation.
This suggests that the market does not expect dividend growth to be high
enough to protect investors against inflation.
The latest figures for dividend growth are not encouraging. During the
second half of the 1980s, annual growth was between 15 to 20 per cent,
averaging 8 per cent in real terms. It has now dropped to below 2 per cent
year on year. 'This has come as a surprise,' says Nick Train, investment
director of GT unit managers. 'The consensus view was that it would be more
like 5 to 7 per cent. We have now come to the end of a remarkable period for
dividend growth in the UK stock market.'
That growth was stimulated in the 1980s by the rise in company profits and
the takeover boom, which encouraged companies to raise their dividends to
maintain shareholders' loyalty. Large dividend payouts in the 1980s also
helped to drive up share prices - some analysts would argue that, with
investors chasing income, British companies were overdistributing.
It is, therefore, no coincidence that there has also been a sharp rundown to
historically low levels of dividend cover - the margin of safety between
company earnings and the amount it pays out. The long-term dividend cover
has been 2.5 times but it is now 1.75 times and probably still going down,
according to Train. By paying out, instead of conserving their cash,
companies with low cover are taking the risk of 'mortgaging their future,'
he believes.
Companies have continued to pay dividends in spite of the recession, fearing
a drop in the share price which could follow a cut. This has been in spite
of a warning last November from Robin Leigh Pemberton, governor of the Bank
of England, that it would be irresponsible of companies to maintain
dividends by dipping into reserves. But many, such as Barclays Bank and
Commercial Union, held - or even increased - their dividends in spite of
large drops in profit.
'Companies held their dividends because they thought they could sustain them
until the economic upturn came by,' says Leonard Klahr, of Capel-Cure Myers
Asset Management. But the recession has lasted longer than expected, and
analysts expect some companies that struggled to maintain dividends in March
to cut them in the next set of results.
The historically low level of dividend cover means that when there is an
upturn in the economy, many companies may prefer to invest in the business
rather than increase payments. This indicates depressed prospects for
dividend growth, a conclusion reached also by BZW equity strategists in this
month's Equity Strategy: 'Given the painfully low level of cover, we only
expect a recovery (of dividend growth) to around 4 per cent later this year.
There is no prospect of the same strong real growth in dividends that
accompanied the earnings upturn from 1984.'
Another reason why growth is likely to be slow is that analysts do not
expect profits to be as high as in the 1990s. Mark Cliffe, chief economist
at Nomura in London, argues that corporate profits in the 1980s benefited
from sterling's depreciation. As the pound fell in value, overseas
competition was reduced and profit margins for UK companies increased. But
now sterling is in the ERM, it is no longer free to fall, blocking the
'depreciation route' as a way to sustain corporate profitability.
While the overall picture for dividend growth is expected to be flat, there
is considerable variation in the market. 'People who want dividend growth
have to look at areas like the utilities where there is good profitability
and good cover,' says Klahr. 'Growth in dividends is expected to be 9 per
cent among the utility companies, which represents 4-5 per cent real
growth.'
Another promising area is pharmaceuticals. Bob Semple, of County NatWest,
expects dividend growth of 20 per cent for the sector this year and 15 per
cent next year. The catch for income investors, however is that
pharmaceutical companies with high dividend cover, such as Glaxo, tend to
have low yields which make them unattractive for the income-seeking
investor. At the other end of the scale, many property companies are on a
high yield and have been paying out dividends uncovered by earnings.
For the future, Semple expects dividend growth of 5 to 6 per cent in the
next few years against a background of 4 per cent inflation. Other analysts
see little or no growth in dividends over the next few years. But a note of
optimism is struck by Chris Rodgers, fund manager of the Schroder Income
fund, who believes the worst is over. 'It should take a couple of years for
companies to build up cover but, after that, we should see a return to real
dividend growth,' he predicts.

FT  13 JUN 92 / Markets: OFT reports fuel disclosure debate - Serious Money
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'THE STRUCTURE and level of remuneration of salespeople and intermediaries
may influence the savings and investment advice that is given to consumers,
with advice skewed in favour of some products and companies.'
These clinical but provocative words are the joint conclusion of two
excellent reports written by Helena Wiesner and Jeremy Mitchell and
published this week by the Office of Fair Trading. The sentiments will be
familiar to FT readers.
Having dropped its bombshells, the OFT, making its first foray into the
world of consumer finance, said it had not decided whether to accept the
reports' recommendations. If it does, it will re-open the most contentious
issue facing the consumer finance industry - commission disclosure - which
seemed to have been put to rest by the recent Securities and Investments
Board review.
Understandably, this arouses great anger. Intermediaries, most of whom do an
excellent and worthwhile job, feel that both their livelihoods and their
honesty are being questioned. Neither is necessarily the case. But the issue
will not go away.
In her report, Wiesner says that when an independent intermediary arranges a
sale he should, before it is completed, reveal in cash terms the commission
he will be paid. Why? Because commissions vary from company to company and
from product to product, creating conflicts of interest which will be
clearer if the commission is visible.
Commission is the price of an intermediary's advice. It is, therefore, hard
to justify hiding it. But the SIB decided for two reasons against forcing
disclosure: first, that the total charges connected to the product
(including administration and so on) were more important than the commission
alone; and, second, that requiring IFAs to reveal their commission would put
them at a competitive disadvantage with direct sales forces which can hide
behind incentive schemes that mask the cut they are taking.
Both arguments have some merit. But are they sufficient to justify SIB's
stance? Wiesner concludes, with devastating logic, that they are not.
Total charges are important - there is no point paying a small commission if
a life office is inefficient - but that does not mean commission is
unimportant. SIB admitted that it erred on the side of 'paternalism' and
wanted to prevent consumers being confused by too much information.
Perhaps 'patronising' is a better word than 'paternal.' If the information
is useful for the consumer, it should not be withheld. But the issue of the
'level playing field' with tied agents and direct salesmen is trickier.
The OFT reports show the huge amounts of commission that building societies
 -only two of which haveindependent status - rake in from insurance sales.
Commission accounted for 27 per cent of profits for the Halifax, tied to
Standard Life, in 1990. Tied agents and direct sales forces surely bear the
lion's share of responsibility for the present wasteful level of surrenders
of endowment policies.
But would it be to the disadvantage of independents to have to reveal their
commission? Surely not. Independent advice is a more valuable commodity than
the salesmanship available at a building society. If it were labelled
clearly with a price, consumers might appreciate this more.
Then there is the question of agency. Mitchell's report cites an Appeal
Court judgment which found it remarkable that a broker 'who is remunerated
by the insurance industry, and who presents suggested policies on their
behalf' should be treated as the agent of the policyholder.
If IFAs are agents for the consumer, and not just freelance salesmen, then
Wiesner suggests it is fair to have higher expectations from them. I quote:
'The independent intermediary is the agent of the client. His service should
be on a par with other professional services - such as those offered by a
solicitor or an accountant - where the adviser would normally charge a fee
and, in any event, has a duty to account to his client for any commission
received. The tied agent, by contrast, is a salesman for his company and
their agent rather than the client's'
In other words, IFAs should be on a different playing field from tied
agents.
A fully fee-based system would remove conflicts of interest at source.
Sadly, though, this will not happen in Britain for many years. Most
financial products come with commissions built in, the tax system is
unfavourable, and the public is not prepared to pay fees. Insurers are
generally more reliable as prompt payers than consumers.
For the time being, clear and transparent commissions will have to do. If
customers can see the incentives, and how much they are paying, much of the
conflict diagnosed in the OFT reports disappears. In many cases, a
commission will be revealed as a perfectly reasonable price to pay.
For the good of independent advisers, whose status would be enhanced, and,
most importantly, the consumer, the OFT should urge the government to
enforce disclosure of commissions at point of sale.

SOME sectors, such as building materials, seem to defy the gravity of the
comments made by company chairmen in their enjoyment of high,
recovery-anticipating ratings. Other sectors, notably conglomerates, look
cheap even though many of their constituents also would benefit from an
upturn. Sometimes, it almost seems their defensive qualities, such as a
spread of activities and locations, are held against them. This line of
thinking has led Credit Lyonnais Laing to bring out a document arguing that
investors seeking recovery stocks can find better value among what it calls
'holding companies.' The examples include Hanson, BTR, Williams Holdings and
Cookson.
Part of the argument is that just because the profits of well-spread
companies have not been slashed by recession, it 'does not mean they cannot
rise sharply.' They, too, operate in cyclical industries - BTR in motor
components, for instance. The trouble is that the sector might be cheap for
good reason and that, when it comes to buying, the very diversity of the
companies involved makes individual stock selection much more important than
sectoral characteristics.
Take the cheapness. The conglomerates sector includes some big bad
performers - Lonrho and Trafalgar House, for example. And it is dominated by
Hanson, where the rating has declined for a variety of reasons. Some of
these reasons are peculiar to Hanson. Others have been applied more
generally in a derogatory way to holding companies.
Accounting policies often are picked over. The acquisitive activities of
these groups have prompted questions about whether earnings growth is
genuine or inflated by the below-the-line write-downs and provisions allowed
by acquisition accounting.
On the other hand, perception of these companies will depend partly on their
acquisition strategy. What will Williams Holdings go for after failing to
take Racal Electronics? When will Tomkins make a move? BTR has at least
pulled off a big deal with its acquisition of Hawker Siddeley.
Some of these organisations may also be seen as traders in companies whose
profits may be boosted by gains on one offtransactions. And they can look
unfocused. These were the kinds of arguments which led to the unbundling of
Racal. And such ideas are gaining renewed currency as conglomerates become
unfashionable.
A contrary opinion would point to the way acquirers, with the legitimate
help of flexible accounting, have rationalised many a company and sold off
weak subsidiaries to reduce gearing. The lack of focus need not matter when
a strong management system can be applied to a variety of operations.
The last point is illustrated by Tomkins, which has an explicit management
formula. Its justification has been the continuing progress in earnings per
share and the Pounds 70m cash accumulated by last November. But then,
Tomkins' share price has outperformed the FT-A All-share index by a third in
the past year.
So, when it comes to individual stock selection, the price may be up with
events, and there has been some recognition of the holding companies'
virtues in sectors other than conglomerates. Other industrial materials and
business services have both recovered lost ground.
Nevertheless, they remain much cheaper than single-industry cyclicals, such
as building materials and hotels and leisure. Hence the case for taking an
interest in them.
David Ireland, conglomerates analyst at Hoare Govett, says they suit the
'cautious' investor who attaches as much weight to track record as to
recovery hopes. Financial strength should be an important attribute of the
stocks.
With doubts about the timing and the strength of recovery reflected in the
recent slipping of the FT-SE 100 index, fortune may favour the cautious
rather than the bold.

FT  13 JUN 92 / Markets: A scary ride for the high rollers - Wall Street
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN FRIEDMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MANY US investors were left with a rather queasy feeling as the equity
markets closed yesterday, the result of a roller-coaster ride of Coney
Island dimensions.
The swings in the Dow Jones Industrial Average - which lost a fulsome 61
points between Tuesday and Wednesday before beginning to regain lost ground
on Thursday - says a great deal about the jittery nature of market sentiment
these days.
The uncertainty stems from a raft of conflicting data on the patchy US
economic recovery, puzzlement about the US presidential sweepstakes and a
gradual realisation that parts of the market may be dangerously overvalued.
Some encouragement for buyers came from the release of seasonally adjusted
consumer price figures yesterday morning. These showed a less-than-expected
0.1 per cent rise for May. The figures imply an average annual inflation
rate of just 1.7 per cent, well below the 3 per cent average annual rise in
the consumer price index since the start of calendar 1992.
James Solloway, director of research at Argus Research, called the inflation
figure 'a fairly decent number' while other analysts noted that the market
could now be priming itself for more attempts at a rally.
'Investors are still jittery about the strength of the economy and of
corporate profits, and the Fed is showing no inclination to lower interest
rates further,' Solloway said, adding there was thus little to power the
market on a sustained basis.
The May inflation number will not, on its own, persuade the Federal Reserve
to abandon its wait-and-see stance toward a cut in interest rates. But it
should help to improve prospects for a Fed easing, possibly in the next four
to six weeks.
Until this week's Dow Jones index gyrations, the New York equity market had
moved relatively little over the previous three weeks. Investors had been -
and remain - both nervous and confused about the near-term trend in prices.
The problem is that recent economic data have suggested the US recovery is
continuing, but very slowly. The underlying market sentiment is therefore
quite negative and as the market lacks any fundamental support it has become
susceptible to the kind of sudden sell-offs that occurred in the middle of
this week.
Add to this equation a Dow Jones Industrial Average of nearly 3,400 and it
is not hard to see why the market looks even more overvalued than it did
during the exaggerated bull run at the start of this year. The issue
investors should be considering is whether all of this points to mere
corrections in prices, downward blips of 20 to 40 points or the risk of a
more substantial and damaging sell-off.
An example of this fragile market psychology came on Wednesday, a day after
the Dow Jones index had dropped more than 34 points. The announcement late
on Tuesday of a 6.3 per cent decline in consumer borrowing in April
unsettled traders and investors; this was, after all, the largest monthly
drop in more than a decade. Since a lack of consumer confidence threatens
the US recovery, so does the indication that consumers are still trying to
reduce their personal debt burdens.
The increasingly surreal nature of the 1992 presidential campaign only adds
to market unease. President George Bush, warts and all, may still be the
candidate of choice for many Wall Street investors. But he seems to stumble
on a nearly daily basis.
Ross Perot, no matter how adept he has shown himself to be in using tabloid
television chat shows, is so far a demagogue with few detailed policy
positions.
The equity market hates uncertainty, has no idea what Perot might really do
on the economic front and has been confronted this week by the spectacle of
grown men in Washington engaging in supposedly high-minded debate about
whether a constitutional amendment is needed to balance the budget.
The result of this cloudy outlook can be read in the index tables. Three
weeks ago the Dow Jones index stood at 3,386.77. By June 5 the index had
risen to 3,398.69. At its low point this week - on Wednesday  - the index
was down to 3,343.22. And at lunch-time yesterday, grasping at the inflation
numbers for reassurance, the index had recovered to a level of 3,372.
A more realistic level for the index might be back in the 3,200 to 3,250
range. But that implies a fairly substantial drop - of more than 100 points.
It could yet happen.

FT  13 JUN 92 / Markets: Companies utter a chorus of groans - London Markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARTIN, Financial Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE AIR HAS been full of the groans of companies giving up on the economic
recovery. Sir Anthony Pilkington, chairman of the company that bears his
name, announced the first dividend cut since his family sold shares to the
public. It was a time for prudence, he said, because he could not see 'the
mechanism to start a recovery' in either the UK or the US. 'There is
unprecedented uncertainty about the timing, nature and strength of the
recovery,' he went on.
That news came on Thursday, as the CBI reported weak retail sales in May and
the car industry reported a fall in output because of poor export sales.
Pilkington's shares dropped 3p, to close the day at 129p, down from 164p
just over a month ago.
On Friday, the chorus of 'Recovery? what recovery?' was taken up by Taylor
Woodrow at its annual general meeting. Announcing 'a considerably reduced
level of dividends' for the current year, Colin Parsons, chairman, said that
the economic downturn had 'devastated' the industries in which the company
operated. Given this, he said, 'we must expect any recovery, when it comes,
to be gradual'. Taylor Woodrow's shares fell 10p, to 94p, a drop of 9p on
the week.
Other construction industry shares also fell; the sector as a whole dropped
9 per cent on the week. One influence was a note from John Wriglesworth of
UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, who argued that 1.5m UK householders had mortgages for
more than their homes were worth. Fear of falling into this debt trap was
stopping first-time buyers from launching themselves on to the housing
market this year, he said, even though homes were more affordable than at
any time since 1984.
There were two spectacular pieces of gloomy corporate news during the week.
Regalian, the property developer, announced a pre-tax loss of Pounds 27m for
the year to March, but its auditors, Ernst &amp; Young, clearly felt the figure
could have been worse: it qualified the figures because of the difficulty of
valuing development sites.
The other bad news came from Fisons, which issued a warning about poor
results in the first half of the year (though it was talking about its own
particular troubles with US drug regulators rather than the state of the
economic cycle). Amid a chorus of complaints from analysts, Fisons' shares
fell 100p in the minutes after the announcement, closing on Friday at 244
1/2 p, down 115 1/2 p on the week.
Against this background, it was not surprising that on Friday the FT-SE
index came within a few points of closing below 2,600, ending the day at
2,603.7. The index has fallen 134.1 since its post-election peak a month
ago.
If worries about the economic recovery lie behind the market's unease, next
week will provide plenty of opportunity for further hand-wringinging, as a
flood of UK economic statistics are published. Another reason for edginess,
however, has been political uncertainty in the wake of the Danish vote on
the Maastricht treaties. As it became clear that Conservative MPs were
unhappy with the government's initial support for a 'business as usual'
approach to Maastricht ratification, gilt yields continued to move upwards,
and sterling remained weak. Thursday's referendum in Ireland will prove
another crucial hurdle for the Maastricht treaties. If they fail to surmount
it, more market bumpiness lies ahead. As the chart shows, the FT-SE has
dropped more, since the Danes' Maastricht vote, than the German DAX index -
but less than the French equivalent, the CAC-40 index.
Still, the week was also notable for some good news from companies. John
Ritblat, the chairman of British Land, said the worst was over in the UK
property market; Amersham International, the health science group, announced
a 34 per cent rise in pre-tax profits in the year to March; TI celebrated an
overwhelming victory in its bid for Dowty; and Racal announced a swing from
a loss of Pounds 22m last financial year to a pre-tax profit of Pounds 56m.
The market greeted a flow of small and medium-sized rights issues with
equanimity, and looked set to swallow new issues from MFI, Telegraph and GPA
with similar sangfroid.
News of such developments was almost elbowed into obscurity, however, by a
flood of announcements from the regulators of privatised companies. The most
important of these developments was a new price formula for British Telecom,
announced by its regulator, Oftel. The price cap on BT's services tightens
from the rise in the Retail Price Index minus 6 1/4 per cent to RPI minus 7
1/2 per cent - a rather harsher ruling than the market had expected.
Together with a number of more detailed changes, this means - according to
estimates from County NatWest - that there will be a 2.8 per cent drop in
turnover and a Pounds 250m drop in pre-tax profits. If BT does not accept
the new formula, it will be referred to the Monopolies and Mergers
Commission.
The ruling was announced on Tuesday, pushing BT's shares down 8p on the day
to 354p. By Friday it had slipped further, to close at 350 1/2 p, down 13
1/2 p on the week. Since last autumn, BT has underperformed the FT-SE index,
of which it is one of the largest single components, by 16 per cent. It is
now yielding 5.6 per cent, towards the top end of the range - between 3 1/4
per cent and 6 1/2 per cent - in which it has moved since privatisation. On
the face of it, that looks attractive. The worry, of course, is whether the
regulatory climate has shifted decisively against the company. For the
investor in privatised stocks, such calculations are likely to prove a
permanent feature of life.

Analysts at Hoare Govett are predicting a period of uncertainty for smaller

out by the latest indices. The Hoare Govett Small Companies index (capital
gains version) fell 2.03 per cent to 1272.1 over the seven days to June 11.
The County Nat West index showed an almost identical trend, dropping 1.97

<TEXT>
Edinburgh Fund Managers is launching a Japanese investment trust which aims
to raise between Pounds 15m and Pounds 20m. It is the first new Japanese
investment trust launch for ten years. EFM Japan will come to the market via
an institutional placing and offer to intermediaries. It will not be a
complex split-capital issue but has a conventional structure - there will
only be ordinary shares, plus warrants issued on a one-for-five basis. Iain
Watt, EFM managing director, said he was confident that the trust would not
move to a discount to net asset value. The ordinary shares of 25p will be
issued at 100p while the warrants will be exercisable from 1993 to 2005 at
that price. The trust is open for subscription between June 15-June 23.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Gold prices, which are in a mid-summer trough after peaking in the winter,
appear to be in a seasonal price cycle. Prices showed only a slight
improvement of just under Dollars 1 per fine ounce over the week. Analysts
are speculating that seasonal movements in both oil and the dollar reinforce
the gold price swings. Consumer demand for gold is highest during the winter
in many parts of the world, say analysts, because of a concentration of
festivals, including Christmas in the west and the Chinese New Year in
February.

Maxwell's empire - He committed one of the biggest frauds of recent years.
In a seven-month investigation the FT has uncovered how Maxwell, vain,

<TEXT>
THE SUNDAY morning calm of Oxfordshire on July 7 last year was broken by the
clatter of helicopter blades. The four-seater Aerospatiale Twin Squirrel,
registration G-RMGN, with the Mirror Group Newspapers lion growling on its
side, lowered itself onto the grass in front of Headington Hill Hall, a
30-room Edwardian mansion. Robert Maxwell stepped out. The weather forecast
had said it would be one of the hottest days of the year, and staff carried
Maxwell's desk and telephone out from the house to the side of the pool. A
chauffeur-driven car pulled up and Maxwell's youngest son Kevin jumped out,
looking tense and irritated. 'Get me Richardson on the phone,' Maxwell told
his secretary, demanding to speak to the chairman of Smith New Court, the
ambitious City stockbrokers to Maxwell's public companies. Sir Michael
Richardson, who was entertaining members of the local foxhunt and their
families to Sunday lunch, was called to the phone. Maxwell told him he had
changed his mind. He no longer wanted to step down as chairman of Maxwell
Communication Corporation (MCC), his largest company. He would not give way
to Peter Walker, the former Tory cabinet minister who was a director of
Smith New Court. This was a devastating blow to Kevin. As MCC's chief
executive, he had longed for the day when he would run the show. It had been
his plan to bring in Peter Walker. But now there would be no liberating
change in style, no freedom from the whims of a dominant father.
A furious row erupted between father and son by the side of the pool. With
the Filipino maid still laying the table for lunch, Kevin drove off, shaking
with rage.
When Maxwell's decision became public two weeks later, MCC's shares started
to collapse, and accelerated the Maxwell empire's slide to disaster. But the
alternative - allowing Walker into the inner sanctum  - would have been
impossible. Giving control to an outsider might have led to the discovery of
the awful truth at its heart.
The Robert Maxwell story is about the vanity, brutality and delusion of one
man, and how he persuaded others to believe him.
He borrowed Pounds 3bn from the world's biggest and most respected banks to
build an empire that was doomed to failure. As it tottered, he stole more
than Pounds 900m from his companies and their pension funds, most of it in
just 10 months as he made a futile effort to pacify the banks.
All he bought with the stolen pensions of 30,000 past and present employees
 -many of whom now face destitution - was a few more months of life at the
cost of Pounds 3m a day.
No-one stopped him committing one of the biggest business frauds of the
century. One after the other, the lines of defence failed: directors, banks,
trustees, pension regulators and the Bank of England.
They failed to notice the signs, or to recognise their seriousness; in some
cases, they even failed to look. But the signs were there. As Maxwell was
arguing with his son in his Oxford garden, the cracks had started to appear.
One crack opened the very next day.
The small blond man who stepped into the revolving doors of Maxwell
Communication Corporation at Holborn Circus in the centre of London on
Monday July 8 was unprepared for the shock that hit him.
He was about to stumble on one of the first signs of trouble in the Maxwell
empire, but he could hardly have guessed at the crisis that lay hidden.
Basil Brookes had been MCC's finance director for only nine months: one of
Robert Maxwell's chosen few, with a ringside seat at the unfolding drama, or
so he thought. MCC, whose most valuable asset was US publisher Macmillan,
ranked as one of the top 100 companies on the London stock market. It was
valued at Pounds 1bn, making it worth more than twice as much as Mirror
Group Newspapers (MGN), Maxwell's second public company. It was Brookes'
first public company directorship, and an impressive post for someone aged
only 33.
Looking through the accounts, Brookes expected to see that MCC had a
comforting pile of Pounds 200m ready cash in the bank. But the money had
vanished.
'We were hoarding that cash,' Brookes says. MCC was creaking under nearly
Dollars 2bn of debt and needed the money to pay the bankers.
In a normal company, the missing amounts could easily have been traced. But
in Maxwell's corporate labyrinth, figures were hard to come by, even for
finance directors.
The company ledgers for June had not yet been drawn up, so Brookes had
painfully to reconstruct MCC's payments from the treasury department, which,
under Kevin Maxwell's day-to-day direction and Robert Maxwell's authority,
moved cash around the Maxwell empire.
Brookes says: 'It was always an effort to get information out of the
treasury - they were always busy and chaotic. It took me a few days to get
the numbers, but I got them.' To his horror, the cash had disappeared into
the companies that Maxwell called the 'private side' of his empire.
This 'private side' - a tangled web of nearly 400 companies, many no more
than brass nameplates in offshore tax-havens - was run by Maxwell, his sons
Kevin and Ian, and a few trusted aides from the London offices. It held
Maxwell's investments in property and foreign newspapers, as well as blocks
of MCC and MGN shares - Maxwell's majority shareholdings in the public
companies.
The web was gathered under two parent companies: Headington Investments,
owned by a Gibraltar trust company, and the Maxwell Charitable Foundation,
registered in the secretive principality of Liechtenstein. Tight
confidentiality laws and obsessive secrecy within the core group shielded
both companies from public scrutiny.
Directors of the public Maxwell companies, MCC and MGN, talk of an 'iron
curtain' which divided them from that hidden empire.
In May, MCC had lent Pounds 75m of its precious cash to the private side.
But Kevin Maxwell, a director of both the private and public companies, had
assured Brookes that the money would be repaid by the end of June.
As he combed the books, however, Brookes realised the hole had more than
doubled, mainly during June, to Pounds 180m.
'My reaction was one of shock,' says Brookes. 'I felt let down. First, it
wasn't back to zero. Then, no-one had bothered to tell me.'
He ran up the stairs from his office on the eighth floor to Maxwell's on the
ninth, and met Maxwell and Kevin together. They told him there had been a
delay in selling some of the private side businesses, but promised the hole
would soon be filled.
Brookes found the story plausible. It was not the first time MCC had lent
the private side money - there was a history of such loans - but MCC had
always been repaid. Nevertheless he kept checking. Each morning he dug out
the bank statements from the post and pieced them together.
Any relief he might have felt soon evaporated. Within days, more money had
gone out: Pounds 75m in one lump, on a single signature - Robert Maxwell's.
To Brookes' acute frustration, this was within the company's rules. In most
companies it would be impossible for the chairman to pay out so much money
on his own. But MCC had its own rules, dating from when it was called
British Printing Corporation and was rescued by Maxwell from financial
disaster. In a fateful board resolution on November 26, 1981, Robert Maxwell
had assumed supreme power. His signature alone could sign away the company's
assets. Brookes had no way of stopping more money vanishing. 'I was fighting
10 years of history,' he says.
Brookes ran up the stairs again, around the corner, and down the short
grubby corridor that led to Kevin's office. 'I asked him 'What the hell is
going on?' Kevin said, calmly: 'I'm under instructions not to talk to you.
You must go to my father'.'
Brookes opened the double doors to reception and dodged left down the
corridor to Maxwell's secretary, who allowed him into Maxwell's office.
Seated behind his desk at the far end of the 60ft room, Maxwell refused to
tell Brookes where the Pounds 75m had gone and when it would come back.
Brookes said: 'I have to know, it's my job.' But Maxwell rebuffed him,
saying: 'You'll just have to trust me. It's all OK.'
Brookes spent the next few nights sleepless. 'I got really worried as the
days went on. It was so much money, it went so quickly and they wouldn't
talk about it.' He telephoned Richard Baker, MCC's former deputy managing
director, who had left in February. Baker had been one of Brookes' main
allies in Maxwell House.
Baker, a combative man, had done nothing to soften the outside face of MCC.
But he had also turned his trenchancy against Maxwell. One of MCC's main
bankers comments: 'I think it made an extraordinary difference that Baker
left.'
In a scene which characterised the sense of conspiracy that would grip the
Maxwell empire, the two men arranged to meet outside a rugby club near High
Wycombe. They parked next to each other, and Brookes went to sit in Baker's
car.
Baker told him: 'You've got to see Kevin, and if you don't get an
explanation, then you have to take professional advice on your own behalf.'
What Brookes did not know was that Maxwell was taking money from MCC partly
because other sources were drying up. On July 10 at 3pm Maxwell had asked
National Westminster, the second largest UK bank and one of the largest
lenders to Maxwell, for another Pounds 40m loan for his private companies.
The bank had refused.
Nor did Brookes know, and would not know until weeks after Maxwell's death,
how some of the money siphoned off from MCC had been spent. In mid April
Maxwell had begun an illicit operation to prop up MCC's shares, which
eventually cost some Pounds 250m. The share support coincided with the
disappearance of money from MCC, and the company's administrators now
believe some of MCC's money was used to buy the shares. However, it is
against the Companies Act for a company to buy its own shares without
shareholders' permission or for a director to buy shares without telling the
company.
In one of his most closely-guarded acts, Maxwell had routed cash through the
private side and out to secret trusts in Liechtenstein and Switzerland, in
order to disguise the identity of the buyer of the shares.
He told brokers who dealt for him that these trusts were entirely
independent, but it is now clear that the shares that were bought were under
Maxwell's control.
Maxwell had resorted to this desperate measure because the survival of the
private side hung on MCC's share price. It was this fatal intertwining of
the two sides of his empire that was to lead to its collapse.
Unknown to the outside world, the private companies had accumulated debts of
some Pounds 1bn in 1991. To raise this huge sum, Maxwell had pledged his own
shares in both MCC and MGN to the banks, effectively mortgaging them. But
MCC's share price had been falling since the autumn of 1990 because the
market was worried about the company's massive debt. If the share support
scheme could not halt the slide, the banks would call in their loans, and
the private side would crash. Maxwell was like a home owner with a huge
mortgage on a house whose value was dropping by the day.
On Wednesday July 17 the bomb dropped: MCC's annual report was published.
The outside world learnt that Peter Walker, who represented the hope that
MCC would be run in a conventional way, would not become its chairman.
Maxwell explained that MCC was now planning to demerge its US businesses,
which made 90 per cent of its profits, one of Peter Walker's
recommendations. 'The task he (Walker) was originally invited to do . . .
the chairman of the entire group both in the US and Britain . . . will no
longer exist,' said Maxwell.
In his first, extended interview since his departure from MCC, Walker says
he was told by Maxwell on July 11 that 'his services as chairman would no
longer be needed'.
He says that at the time he thought the decision sensible, as he thought the
demerger was in the company's best interests.
However, the demerger never happened; Samuel Montagu, one bank approached by
Maxwell to draw up plans, says Maxwell never held a formal meeting with the
bank on the subject.
In retrospect, Walker says, 'Maxwell may have wanted me out of the way. It
clearly would not have been possible to keep it all hidden. I was going to
set up an audit committee for a close look at all the figures, starting on
July 18, the very next day.'
The stock market, horrified that Robert Maxwell would stay in charge, began
to savage the shares. That week MCC shares fell from 202p to 185p,
increasing the strain on the private side.
On Friday July 26, Brookes discovered that another Pounds 50m had vanished
from MCC, although some had trickled back. The company's administrators now
believe that part of this could have been used to buy still more MCC shares.
Brookes was now faced with a Pounds 275m hole. It was time for him to
protect him-self - and to warn the other directors.
Three days later, Brookes wrote out his resignation. It was untyped - he had
not trusted it to the secretaries - but he filled two pages with large,
neat, rounded handwriting.
His lawyers had told him: 'You can resign, but don't walk out until this is
settled - you have responsibilities as finance director. And you must get a
full meeting of the board.'
Robert Maxwell was abroad when Brookes put the letter on his desk. But
Kevin, who seemed relaxed, took a copy and agreed to call a board meeting
for 10am on Thursday August 1.
Word spread among some of the directors that the reason for the meeting was
that 'the Maxwells have taken all our money'.
Furious, but worried they braced themselves for a confrontation. The anxious
group included Brookes, tax director Ron Woods and deputy chairman Jean
Pierre Anselmini. Five minutes before the board was due to meet, Robert
Maxwell, who was still abroad, telephoned to postpone the meeting to the
next day. Then, as the directors gathered on Friday morning, he called again
and cancelled the meeting.
The Maxwells were fond of challenging the loyalty of their directors. 'Are
you with us or against us?', they would ask. From that Friday, the answer
was: 'Against you.'
On Sunday August 4, Brookes went into MCC to answer a nagging mystery: how
had the private side borrowed more money from MCC than the company had to
lend?
By the evening, Brookes had dug up the answer. He telephoned Peter Laister,
a non-executive director, and Woods, and told them to meet him at 11am the
next morning.
Brookes had uncovered another shock. The mystery money had been 'borrowed'
from MCC's banks in an highly irregular way. The money was in effect
borrowed for one reason but ultimately used for another.
Starting around July 4, when the senior treasurer had gone on holiday, MCC's
treasury, under the authority of Robert Maxwell and Kevin, had begun to buy
enormous amounts of foreign currencies.
The ground rules of these so-called 'spot deals' are that the currency must
be paid for by the close of business each day. The world's largest banks,
which trade billions of pounds worth of currencies each day, move fast to
blacklist any company that does not pay on time.
But MCC did not pay up. Several days later, when the banks bombarded the
company's switchboard in fury, the treasury raised money to pay them by
entering into more contracts with a second set of banks. Again, it did not
pay, until it had struck deals with a third set of banks.
In three weeks, MCC burned its bridges with some 20 of the world's biggest
banks. It was a crippling situation for a company that straddled the
Atlantic and which had made much of its profits from dealing in foreign
exchange.
Despite the seriousness with which they viewed the breach, none of the banks
appears to have investigated further. None saw this behaviour as
sufficiently worrying to warrant a word to the Bank of England.
Surveying the figures, which showed Dollars 100m still unpaid, Brookes came
to the sobering conclusion that the frantic deals had halted only because
the company had run out of banks. That led him to the even more frightening
conjecture that, if the private side was apparently so desperate for money,
it could be in crisis - and that MCC could be sacrificed in the panic.
The MCC directors who had made this discovery, including the non-executives
Laister, Lord Rippon, the former Tory cabinet minster, and David Shaffer, a
US director, had a clear choice at that point. They could go public with the
discovery or they could stay silent. They chose the second course. Had they
chosen the first, the Maxwell empire would have died three months earlier
than it did, and over Pounds 200m of pension and company money could have
been saved. But they were unaware of the crisis in the rest of the empire.
The choice was difficult because of the conflict between two sets of
responsibilities. Directors have obligations under the Financial Services
Act to make public important news that could affect the share price. But
under the Companies Act, they must also act in the company's best interest.
The directors guessed, rightly, that if the private side was desperate, it
would have pledged its MCC shares to its banks. So if they made the loans
public, the shares would crash, bringing the private side down too, and MCC
would never get its money back.
The next day, early in the afternoon of Tuesday August 6, Laister went to
consult solicitors Macfarlanes about the conflict. He reported to the group
at 4pm: stay quiet - and get the money back.
In retrospect, the directors were in a stronger position than they may have
realised. Having chosen that route, they could have pursued it with more
resolution. If they had threatened Maxwell repeatedly that they would resign
en bloc and make their reason public, they might have succeeded in filling
in more of the hole in their company.
Instead, the directors appear to have allowed themselves to set aside their
own diagnosis of the crisis in the private side of the empire. They relaxed
too soon. They were also comforted by the sudden reappearance of some of the
money. Over the weekend and during that Monday, the Pounds 275m hole had
shrunk to Pounds 135m. 'We were deeply relieved,' says Laister.
Suddenly, at 5pm, while the directors were digesting Macfarlanes' verdict,
Robert Maxwell ordered them to assemble for a board meeting at 6pm in his
office. He had chosen his moment well: the directors were calmer than they
had been the week before.
Maxwell was seated at his huge black circular table, with Kevin on one side
and Ian on the other. The four dissident London directors - Laister,
Brookes, Anselmini and Woods - ranged themselves on the opposite side.
Maxwell accused them of meeting in secret cabals without the Maxwell family,
and ordered them not to take notes, saying that he would circulate minutes
afterwards.
Guessing - rightly - that those minutes would never appear, the directors
met at 7pm to compile and initial their own version. Brookes says: 'We
picked Ron's office as it was in the Mirror building - we were less likely
to have one of the family barge through the door.'
Their minutes note that Kevin had promised that the situation was in hand
and he would provide a timetable for paying back the rest of the money.
Laister says: 'Not for one second did Kevin or Bob give any indication they
were worried. The opposite, in fact.' Brookes adds: 'We thought it had gone
reasonably well. It had been pretty hostile, but it was a big step in the
right direction.'
To the relief of the directors, the temperature inside Maxwell House
continued to cool. By August 15, the private Maxwell companies had repaid
Pounds 164.7m to MCC.
The directors took comfort from the scrawled note from Robert Maxwell,
initialled by Kevin, on August 21. It said that 'the borrowings by
Headington Investments from MCC have not been used in any way that would
contravene the Companies Act' - a question Macfarlanes had insisted he
answer. But it is now clear that by that point, the illegal share support
scheme had consumed some Pounds 250m, almost certainly much of it MCC's
money.
They would not have slept if they had known where the Pounds 165m that they
gratefully received had come from:
Pounds 15m now appears to have come from the liquidation of a portfolio of
Japanese shares that belonged not to Maxwell, but to Swiss Bank Corporation.
Pounds 60m had come from an extension of the private side's overdrafts: more
debt it could not repay.
Pounds 40m had travelled, through the airlocks of several private-side bank
accounts, up four flights of stairs and along 200ft of corridors from Mirror
Group Newspapers next door.
And the final Pounds 50m? It now appears to have come indirectly from the
sale of shares belonging to the pension funds of Mirror Group Newspapers and
MCC.
MCC's success in getting its money back was at the expense of others. Fires
were breaking out right through the Maxwell empire. Every source of money
was drying up, and in the following three months Maxwell would raid again
and again the money upon which his unsuspecting pensioners were relying for
their future.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The decision by Sotheby's redoubtable chairman to reduce his shareholding by
a third was bound to affect the company's share price. Mr Alfred Taubman
will continue to hold 14m shares and has pledged to stay as chairman for a
while yet. In addition, he has scarcely called the top of the market.
Although his investment a decade ago in the auction house has proved astute,
Sotheby's shares are a mere third of their price in late 1989. Granted, that
is largely the result of the bursting of the bubble which drove prices for
Impressionist paintings and toy cars to absurd levels. Equally, these days
the big auction houses are less wedded to offering customers the financial
incentives which spurred on their excesses.
The question is whether the 12 per cent fall in the share price yesterday in
London was the correct response. In reducing his stake, Mr Taubman is not
giving up voting control. Moreover, the shares are difficult to value on
fundamentals. This year's profits may reflect little more than a patchy
improvement in the art market. Given that Sotheby's shares have outperformed
those of Christies by a quarter this year, investors can hardly be blamed
for wondering if Mr Taubman is belatedly cashing in after all.

FT  13 JUN 92 / The Lex Column: UK contractors
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
For some months now the market has brushed aside the sky-high earnings
multiples for UK contractors and valued them on their yields and continuing
cash flows. For many, another factor in favour was the potential for
housebuilding to recover early in the cycle. Yesterday, Taylor Woodrow's
chairman, Mr Colin Parsons, effectively told shareholders that this view is
wishful thinking. His remarks had an immediate impact elsewhere, with shares
of Wimpey, Costain, and Persimmon among several to suffer 5 to 10 per cent
falls. Warnings about this year's dividend, thin contracting margins and the
subdued level of property sales should come as little surprise to the
market. The really alarming feature of Mr Parsons' statement was its
implications for Taylor's cash flow. It is there in the gloomy reference to
the structural steel plant of Octavius Atkinson. It is apparent from the
admission that the contracting side is preparing for a reduced workload this
year. And it is obvious from the hint that some of the Greenham wholesaling
businesses could be put on the block. The question for investors - given the
company's existing development commitments - is whether it can even afford
to pay the 5p per share dividend which was being pencilled in for this year.
The message is there for the whole sector. It is no coincidence that Mowlem,
for example, is now trading on an 11.6 per cent yield even after the payout
has been halved. There are implications, too, for Eurotunnel, which will be
under no illusions now that the UK contractors with which it is negotiating
have anything to give away.

FT  13 JUN 92 / The Lex Column: UK economy
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The good news is that underlying inflation is showing some real improvement
at last. Retail prices excluding mortgage payments rose an annual 5.3 per
cent in May compared with 5.7 per cent in April. Better still, service
sector inflation, which has long resisted treatment, has begun to abate. The
process should continue, even though there remain one or two sticky points,
like motor insurance premiums.
The bad news is that the fall in inflation is to some extent a measure of
desperation about the economy. Thursday's CBI distribution survey showed
that post-election optimism fizzled out in May, while City economists are
busy cutting their growth forecasts for the year to almost nothing. A
combination of success on the inflation front and continuing economic
weakness ought to provide the government with a ready excuse for cutting
interest rates. Since Denmark's rejection of the Maastricht Treaty, that
prospect has become even more remote. Base rates may be 5 points below their
peak, but more cuts will be needed to breathe life into the housing market,
in turn a prerequisite for serious recovery.
With the FT-SE 134 points below its peak on May 11, a fair amount of this
must already be in the market. Certainly, the economy is not actually
weakening any more, and the index is in sight of the trading range
established during the first quarter when investors were grappling with
electoral uncertainty. The problem is that the implications of economic
stagnation for corporate earnings in 1992 may not have fully sunk in. Wall
Street is showing signs of nervousness. And there is a daunting number of
new issues to get away, even if some of the proceeds of the Wellcome issue
will doubtless be reinvested in UK equities.

FT  13 JUN 92 / The Lex Column: Lost faith in Fisons
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Yesterday's profoundly depressing news from Fisons could prove the last
straw for its long-suffering shareholders. Only a matter of weeks ago, the
company was steering the market towards first half profits this year of some
Pounds 85m, down only Pounds 10m from the year before. It now appears that
the figure could be as low as Pounds 35m. Not only has the company proved
persistently unable to produce some of its drugs to acceptable standards, it
now appears that its scientific equipment division, supposedly a
counterbalance to the drugs division, will show a drop in profits of some 30
per cent in the first half as well.
How far this is due to bad luck as opposed to bad management may no longer
be relevant. As a good small drug company in a world of giants, Fisons had a
case to make for continued independence. But the big drug companies are also
fast-growing. If, as optimistic forecasts now suggest, Fisons makes Pounds
150m before tax this year, its earnings per share will be lower than five
years before.
Even after yesterday's 100p share price plunge, the Pounds 150m figure would
leave the shares on 15 times earnings. That can scarcely be justified by the
trading record. The question is rather one of break-up value. The problem is
that there are no obvious buyers for both the drug and instrument divisions.
In a market in which warehousing assets is too expensive for most predators
to contemplate, it is perhaps time for the Fisons board to do the decent
thing and break up the company themselves.

FT  13 JUN 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Frankfurt sees some life in
special situations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LATE-closing bourses gave only a limited accolade to the turnround on Wall
Street yesterday, writes Our Markets Staff, and early closers were unwilling
to move on Thursday's change of direction there.
FRANKFURT relied on special situations, the brightest, Porsche, extending
its recent gains to close DM41 higher at DM609, up from DM490 at the end of
May. Elsewhere in consumer goods the discount retailer, Asko, fell DM30 to
DM753 and the fashion house, Escada, by another DM6 to DM317, the latest in
a succession of 1992 lows.
Mr Alex Magona of MAP Securities said that Porsche's gain was in non-voting
stock, ruling out stakebuilding and the takeover stories which came so
easily to dealers' lips yesterday. He thought, however, that US car industry
indications that the worst was over may have helped the company.
Asko, which has been going through changes at board level, stands at a
discount to the retail sector; it is on a p/e of under 10 for 1992 compared
with something over 15 for Karstadt, the sector leader which suffered an
earnings downgrade from Deutsche Bank researchers this week.
In general, equities stayed flat, volume falling from DM5.3bn to DM4.6bn and
the DAX index closing 0.46 higher at 1,782.27 after a 0.79 fall to 710.20 in
the FAZ at midsession. Falls on the week were 0.4 and 0.6 per cent
respectively.
PARIS closed slightly easier, having been in negative territory throughout
the week. The CAC-40 index, which had touched 1,920 earlier in the session,
finally ended 0.55 lower at 1,928.29 in turnover of some FFr2.3bn. The index
lost 2.7 per cent over the week.
One of the main features of the day was the 3.5 per cent rise in Pernod,
advancing FFr56 to FFr1,628 in the absence of news. Elsewhere, St Gobain
reversed Thursday's fall to gain FFr15 to FFr569 following positive comments
at the annual meeting.
Scheider weakened FFr3 to FFr663, but off the day's low of FFr659. The
electrical engineering group and its subsidiaries have had a hard week,
during which the company cut its profits forecast for the year, and since
Monday the shares have lost 13 per cent of their value.
MILAN drifted disconsolately lower, reflecting Italy's political deadlock
and the market's technical problems with screen trading. The Comit index
fell another 2.43 to 474.94, down 2.6 per cent on the week in turnover still
painfully low after Thursday's figure of only L61bn.
In industrials, Italcementi fell L380 to L13,620 ahead of its forthcoming
rights issue. In the banking sector, San Paolo was among the worst
performers, closing at L10,850, down from L11,275 on Thursday and L12,200 at
its initial share placing in March.
ZURICH recovered with Wall Street, the SMI index closing 11.1 higher at
1,879.9, down 2 per cent on the week. Chemicals were the first to gain,
Roche certificates rising SFr30 to SFr3,340 and topping the active list, but
banks and insurances soon joined in with SBC SFr6 higher at SFr269 and
Winterthur SFr80 better at SFr3,190.
BRUSSELS ended higher with late buying of the retailer, GIB, helping to lift
the market. The Bel-20 index put on 1.70 to 1,211 but lost 1.1 per cent on
the week. GIB saw keen foreign interest and its shares gained BFr16 to
BFr1,478. Other movers included Solvay, down BFr150 on profit-taking to
BFr13,250.
AMSTERDAM's CBS Tendency index rose 0.2 to 129.5 but was down 0.7 per cent
on the week. Turnover was Fl 515.4m. KLM improved 70 cents to Fl 40.00,
helped by some buy recommendations. In one, Hoare Govett said that the
carrier has benefited from good traffic levels in one of the industry's
worst years and forecast good medium-term earnings growth.
MADRID was unimpressed by the May inflation data and the general index lost
0.86 to 248.41, a 2.4 per cent drop on the week. Reports that Telefonica's
annual meeting had to be suspended after disruptive action by employees
contributed to a Pta10 fall to Pta1,085.
STOCKHOLM declined for the seventh consecutive session, the Affarsvarlden
General index closing 10.0 lower at 943.5 for a 3.1 per cent drop on the
week. Meanwhile, COPENHAGEN saw a recovery in its hard-pressed insurance
stocks, Hafnia A rising DKr15 to DKr175 and Baltica DKr40 to DKr565 as the
all share index rose 0.81 to 326.10, 1.6 per cent down on the week.

FT  13 JUN 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei drops on tankan
disappointment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES tumbled yesterday afternoon on the Bank of Japan's tankan, or
quarterly business survey, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei average closed 325.37 or 1.8 per cent lower at 17,383.68, 2.2 per
cent down on the week. The index hit the day's high of 17,784.93 immediately
after the opening, as buying by institutional investors absorbed the
unwinding of arbitrage positions on the expiration of June futures
contracts.
In the afternoon, following the tankan, it hit the day's low of 17,331.49.
Volume surged to 750m shares from 245m, with 500m shares changing hands in
the morning session. Declines outnumbered advances by 667 to 295 with 157
unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks closed 17.18 lower at
1,328.36 and, in London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index fell 1.96 to 1,033.20.
The tankan, reflecting poor business sentiment, prompted a fall in the
September futures and triggered further arbitrage unwinding. Overall capital
investment by companies is expected to fall by 2.1 per cent, and pre-tax
profits by 4.8 per cent in the current year to March 1993.
Mr Ross Purdie at SG Warburg Securities said that investors were discouraged
because the figures were in line with expectations. Had they been much
worse, he added, it would have forced the central bank to ease monetary
policy.
Dealers took profits on short term positions ahead of the weekend. Meiji
Milk Products, the most active issue of the day, fell Y27 to Y993 and
Morinaga Milk Industry fell Y14 to Y890.
Real estate issues were weaker on selling by foreign and corporate
investors, discouraged by reports of sharp falls of office rents in central
Tokyo. Mitsui Fudosan fell Y20 to Y910 and Mitsubishi Estate lost Y35 to
Y820.
Nippon Telegraph and Telephone fell Y6,000 to Y603,000. The telecom company
was sold on a suspension of trading on the over-the-counter stock market,
due to NTT telephone line troubles. Trading resumed in the afternoon session
on the OTC market.
In Osaka, the OSE average declined 207.08 to 20,334.72 in volume of 20.2m
shares.
Roundup
A mixed day among Pacific Basin markets featured gainsin Taiwan. Manila was
closed for a holiday.
TAIWAN saw turnover rise to a three-month high as traders were encouraged
following the government's package of measures, announced earlier in the
week, to cut money supply. The weighted index rose 83.88 to 4,681.07 in
turnover of TDollars 41.80bn, and registered an advance of 2 per cent over
the week.
HONG KONG finished down on late profit-taking ahead of a holiday weekend.
The Hang Seng index lost 7.47 to 5,819.07 in light turnover of HKDollars
2.99bn for a fall of 3.7 per cent on the week.
JAKARTA talked about selling pressure but the momentum built up this week
and last left the official index only 0.4 lower on the day at 329.62, 4.4
per cent higher on the week. Brokers said that there was still selective
foreign interest.
BANGKOK maintained its equilibrium after Thursday's 7.3 per cent gain on the
reappointment of Anand Panyarachun as prime minister. The SET index ended
3.46 higher at 740.69 in turnover of Bt7.18bn, 5.4 per cent higher on the
week.
SEOUL's composite index reversed three day's of gains to close 4.30 weaker
at 566.20, for a 0.5 per cent fall on the week.
AUSTRALIA remained weak with the banking sector pulling prices lower. The
All Ordinaries index shed 6.8 to 1,651.3 for a decline of 1.3 per cent on
the week. Westpac lost 1 cent to ADollars 3.37 after a downgrading by the

FT  13 JUN 92 / London Stock Exchange: Account closes with further setback
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A RENEWED wave of bad news from the corporate sector brought further losses
in the UK stock market as the two week trading account closed yesterday.
Trading was dominated by an interim trading report from Fisons, the
pharmaceutical group, where the chairman said profits for the first half
year would be below the comparable figures; the shares fell by Pounds 1.00
in heavy turnover which convinced some traders that a would-be predator had
shown his hand again.
The Fisons blow fell on a stock market already unsettled this week by
repeated signs from leading British companies that the recession in the UK
economy continues to bear down heavily on corporate earnings. In the second
half of the trading session, London almost gave up hope and share prices
backed away in spite of a firm start on Wall Street; the Dow Jones
Industrial Average was 20 points up when London closed only a couple of
points above its low point for the day.
The final reading put the FT-SE Index at 2,603.7, for a net loss of 10.4.
The Index touched 2,601.4 earlier but traders drew little encouragement from
its success in holding on to the Footsie 2,600 mark.
Yesterday's setback brought the loss in the Footsie over the two week
trading account to 103.8 points, or 3.8 per cent. The reaction from the
strength which followed the re-election of the Conservative government in
the UK general election last April has been prompted by uncertainty over
prospects for the Maastricht treaty, following its rejection in the the
Danish referendum, and also by concern over UK corporate earnings.
While genuine investment business has declined, intra-market activity has
increased as marketmakers have grown uneasy ahead of the expiry of the June
futures contract on the FT-SE Index. Seaq turnover remained high yesterday
at 497.7m shares, although there was no repetition of the trading programmes
which boosted turnover on Thursday to 597.7m shares.
The London market was also depressed by a sharp fall in BP shares after US
sources turned determined sellers.
Such was the stock market's concern with the flow of disappointing company
news that little heed was paid to the May Retail Price Index, showing an
unchanged annualised rate of 4.3 per cent; government bonds ended little
changed after the announcement of a new issue of Pounds 500m Index-linked
bonds.
Customer, or retail volume in equities continues to struggle to recover from
nervousness over prospects for the Maastricht treaty.

FT  13 JUN 92 / Week in the markets: LME to meet over zinc squeeze
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD MOONEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE TIGHTENING supply squeeze in the zinc market prompted the London Metal
Exchange to announce late yesterday that an emergency board meeting would be
held on Monday to review the state of the market.
Although LME warehouse stocks of zinc have been rising to ever-higher peaks
a technical shortage centred on the June 17 delivery date has since the
beginning of April pushed the market into a widening 'backwardation' - a
cash premium over forward metal - a situation normally associated with
supply shortage. At yesterday's close the cash premium over three months
metal reached Dollars 189 a tonne, up from Dollars 172 on Thursday.
On April 9, after the cash/three months backwardation had reached a
relatively modest Dollars 12 a tonne, the LME board issued its second
warning this year that it was closely monitoring the zinc market. It said at
that time: 'The board has at its disposal a variety of courses of acxtion
which would be introduced should cicumstances dictate the necessity of such
actions'. The move was described by Mr Martin Abbott, the exchange's
director of marketing as 'a warning shot across the bows of anyone who might
be thinking of playing any games in the zinc market'. But the warning does
not appear to have been heeded.
LME copper prices suffered a shake-out following last week's rally. But the
market steadied yesterday as dealers opted for caution ahead of Sunday's
labour contract vote at Noranda's Montreal smelter. The LME's cash price
closed yesterday at Pounds 1,225 a tonne, down Pounds 15.50 on the week.
Aluminium prices came under renewed pressure from investment fund
liquidation early in the week and falls were magnified by the triggering of
stop-loss selling orders. The three months LME price dipped to a 2 1/2
 month low of Dollars 1,294 a tonne before closing yesterday at Dollars
1,295.75 a tonne, down Dollars 32.75 on the week. Dealers ignored Tuesday's
announcement of a modest fall in LME warehouse stocks and were equally
unimpressed yesterday when a 12,450-tonne rise took the total to a record
1.261m tonnes.
The three months tin price pushed through resistance at Dollars 6,500 a
tonne in mid week to reach a two-year high of Dollars 6,540 a tonne. But the
speculator-driven advance quickly ran into profit-taking and by yesterday's
close the price was back to Dollars 6,492.50 a tonne, up Dollars 25 on the
week.
The London gold market was shaken out of its slumbers after the publication
on Thursday of disappointing US retail sales figures, prompting speculation
on the possibility of a cut in interest rates and heightening inflation
fears. That helped to lift the London price above Dollars 340 a troy ounce
for the first time since mid-April. The advance was not sustained, however,
and the price closed yesterday at Dollars 339.50 an ounce, up Dollars 1.50
on the day and Dollars 1.10 on the week.
Platinum and silver prices were also influenced by the hopes on lower
interest rates. Platinum rose Dollars 2.25 yesterday to Dollars 372.25 an
ounce, up 25 cents on the week, while silver added 2 cents to Thursday's
rally with the cash quotation ending at Dollars 4.09 an ounce, up 2.5 cents
on the week.
At the London Futures and Options Exchange this week saw a resumption of the
bear trend in the cocoa market and the establishment of fresh 16 1/2 -year
lows. In the absence of fundamental developments to account for the fall,
which left the September position Pounds 18 down at Pounds 545 a tonne,
dealers attributed it chiefly to investment fund selling in the US and the
continued slackness of consumer demand. They also noted that sentiment was
weighed down by the prospect of further selling by the Ivory Coast, the
world's biggest cocoa producer, which made a late start to this year's
marketing campaign.
The coffee market fared better, but prices were still down on the week.
Following last week's fall a steadier tone was appartent early on in the
week. But this quickly evaporated as dealers saw no prospect of supportive
developments until closer to the International Coffee Organisations talks
scheduled for June 22-26. At yesterday's close the September robusta futures
price was quoted at Pounds 727 a tonne, down Pounds 3 on the week.
New York cotton prices were boosted because of concern about the Texan crop,
which is reported to have suffered severe damage in some areas from heavy
rain. In late trading yesterday the October futures position reached 64.7
cents a lb, up 4.8 cents on the week.

FT  13 JUN 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The profits warning from Fisons sent an early shiver through stock index
futures, and dominated trading in stock options writes Joel Kibazo.
The steady opening of the June contract on the FT-SE at 2,633 did not last
for the profits warning from Fisons sent June tumbling to 2,612, the day's
low point. A clutch of down gradings in the equities market also played a
part in weakening sentiment.
The release of figures showing a fall in the underlying inflation rate in
the UK helped curtail further falls in June and light buying led to a modest
mid session advance.
The firm Wall street opening led to further buying activity in the afternoon
though a loss of nerve as the market closed once again saw sellers assume
the upper hand. June eventually closed at 2,613 down 16 on the previous
session and around 9 points above its estimated fair value premium to cash
of about 6. Turnover at 8,111 lots was reasonable.
Fisons dominated trading in the options, which recorded a total of 33,623
contracts. The FT-SE option traded 12,472 lots. Fisons traded a total of
5,746 contracts.

FT  13 JUN 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar slides again on CPI
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DOLLAR again slipped sharply against the D-Mark on the foreign exchanges
yesterday after low consumer price data invited speculation that the Federal
Reserve could ease interest rates, writes James Blitz.
The US currency hit a low of DM1.5691 after the consumer price data showed
that inflation grew by a meagre 0.1 per cent in May and by 0.2 per cent in
the non-food and energy sectors. The market had been expecting a rise of 0.3
per cent for both figures.
By the end of the European session, the dollar had clambered back up to
close at DM1.5770, compared to a previous close of DM1.5790. But analysts
feel that the downside risk for the US currency remains strong. 'The figures
show that the Fed has all the room in the world to ease monetary policy,'
said one bank trader.
The dollar's weakness is exacerbated by the German currency's growing
strength in the European Monetary System. The tremors created by Denmark's
'No' to the Maastricht treaty have started to fade away, but the markets now
have to contend with Ireland's referendum next Thursday. Opinion polls
indicate that the Irish will endorse the treaty, but the market will remain
jittery.
Yesterday, two currencies were still suffering Maastricht blues. The Bank of
Spain intervened in the market in the morning, selling D-Marks against the
Spanish peseta at around Pta63.06. This came after Spain's consumer price
index for May showed a higher than expected rise of 0.3 per cent. The Bank
regards the containment of inflation as one of its main priorities, and will
thus want to keep the currency strong. The peseta closed stronger at
Pta62.88 compared to a previous close of Pta63.09.
The Italian lira was also supported by intervention, as the Bank of Italy
sold about DM60m at the midday currency fixing. But the currency still fell
back to Lira757.20 to the D-Mark from a previous close of Lira756.40. Senior
Italian officials said that Italian money market rates were adequate to
defend the currency if next week's Irish vote starts to look uncertain.
Sterling, which has suffered alongside the lira all week, gained against
both the D-Mark and the dollar after May's UK retail prices index was
unchanged at 4.3 per cent for the year. The pound closed up 1/2 a pfennig at
DM2.9200. Against the dollar, it closed at Dollars 1.8520 from a previous
close of Dollars 1.8460.
The yen weakened marginally against the D-Mark after the May Tankan report
on business performance confirmed the broad weakness of the Japanese
economy. The D-Mark rose to Y80.31 from a previous close of Y80.27.

FT  13 JUN 92 / Money Markets: Big shortage fears
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
SHORT rates in the sterling cash market closed firmer yesterday as traders
positioned themselves for the very large shortages expected next week.
A large number of the Bank of England's repurchase agreements are due to
expire next week. Analysts guess that there could be shortages of between
Pounds 5bn and Pounds 7bn over the next five trading days.
As a result, short term rates ended the day a little firmer, looking into
next week rather than to this side of the weekend. In the morning, money had
been inexpensive after the Bank of England forecast a shortage of only
Pounds 250m. But by lunchtime, 3-month money was already firming up to 10
per cent, even though the overnight rate was down at 8 per cent.
That was the tight tone on which the day ended: the 1-week rate ended at 10
1/4 per cent from a previous close of 9 1/2 per cent, and everything from
1-month money to 3-month closed at 10 per cent from a previous close of 9
7/8 per cent.
The Bank of England's operations were light. The Bank did not operate in the
market in the morning. The shortage forecast was later revised to around
Pounds 200m. In the afternoon, the Bank purchased Pounds 150m of Band-1 bank
bills at 9 7/8 per cent and Pounds 39m of Band-2 bank bills at 9 7/8 per
cent. The Bank provided late assistance of around Pounds 15m.
Futures trading responded to the tighter money conditions around the short
dates. The June short sterling contract dropped 3 ticks on the day to close
at 89.97. This suggests that 3-month sterling libor next week, when the
contract expires, will be at 10.03 per cent. The September contract dropped
one tick to close at 90.22. This suggests that 3-month sterling libor in the
Autumn will be at 9.78 per cent.
Analysts said that yesterday's retail prices inflation for May, which was
unchanged at an annual rate of 4.3 per cent, had little impact on the
market. 'The RPI was better than expected,' said one dealer, 'but people had
already revised their forecast downwards in the run-up to the news.'
Instead, the market was gloomier after Mr Helmut Schlesinger, the Bundesbank
President, said that there was no scope for a lowering of German interest
rates.

LAST October's property futures scandal at the London Futures and Options
exchange (FOX) cost the exchange almost Pounds 1m in irregular expenditure,
Reuter reports from London.
According to the chairman's report - to be circulated to the FOX annual
meeting on July 9 - expenditure attributable to the irregularities in the
property futures market has generated exceptional costs of close to Pounds
4m.
The report was written by Mr Andrew Large, who has since taken over as
chairman of the Securities and Investments Board (SIB). The new chairman of
FOX is Mr Michael Jenkins.
The scandal involved the discovery in October last year that trading
incentives had been granted by the exchange to traders dealing in FOX's
screen-traded property, rice and metal index futures (MGMI) contracts.

building
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE New York and American stock exchanges, fierce rivals for nearly a
century, are considering a tentative developer's proposal to build a
headquarters on Wall Street which would house both institutions.
The idea is being floated by JP Morgan, the large New York bank, and would
involve building a new tower on a site adjacent to the current New York
Stock Exchange building. The site, on the corner of Wall and Broad Streets
in lower Manhattan, is now partly occupied by Morgan's former headquarters.
Mr William Strauss, chief financial officer of the American exchange, said
that 'creating a financial hub in lower Manhattan makes a lot of sense to
us'. But he added that Morgan had not yet presented any economic evaluation
of the scheme and no active discussions were taking place.
'They have left us with an idea. I presume they are working on the
economics,' he added.
The scheme envisages the two exchanges remaining separate institutions, with
their own trading floors. However, it could pave the way for a sharing of
functions to cut costs and is likely to prompt speculation about an eventual
merger between the two institutions.
Both the New York exchange and its much smaller rival face increasing
competition from electronic dealing systems which do not require a physical
trading floor.
A spokesman for the New York exchange said merely that it received constant
approaches about possible property developments and was willing to listen to
JP Morgan's ideas.
If the project were to go ahead, the new building would not be ready for
occupation until near the end of the century.
The scheme would demand a large package of aid from the New York city and
state governments, but in return might help stem a gradual drift of business
away from the financial district in lower Manhattan and reinforce the area's
role as the world's leading financial centre.
New York is anxiously awaiting news as to whether Morgan Stanley, the large
investment bank headquartered in mid-town Manhattan, has decided to remain
in the city or move out to Stamford, Connecticut.

KONE, the Finnish engineering group, expects profits to improve during the
rest of 1992 following a sluggish start to the year, Reuter reports from
Helsinki.
On sales up from FM2.8bn to FM3.1bn, pre-tax profits for the first four
months were little changed at FM78m (Dollars 18m), against FM72m. Operating
profits were FM231m, against FM214m.
'The financial result for the remaining eight months of the year is expected
to show an improvement over that for the first four months,' the company
said.
Even so the interim profits exceeded most analysts' expectations.
Kone said its annual net sales were expected to grow only at the rate of
inflation and remain below FM11bn, compared with FM10.04bn in 1991. Kone
said all divisions had improved their results.

FT  13 JUN 92 / International Company News: Bacardi factions kiss and make
up - Canute James finds the company's shareholders burying the hatchet
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CANUTE JAMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The atmosphere is much lighter these days in the offices of the Bacardi
Corporation, the world's biggest rum producer. After five years of a
bruising family quarrel about how the company's ownership should be
structured, the hatchets are being buried.
Minority shareholders have dropped their objections to the Puerto Rican
company being taken private and reverting to mainly family ownership; and as
a result a new holding company is being created to manage the group's
Dollars 3bn of assets.
The new holding company, Bacardi, will be based in Bermuda. It will embrace
the Bacardi Corporation in Puerto Rico, Bacardi and Company in the Bahamas,
Bacardi International in Bermuda, and Bacardi Imports in Miami. The
company's Mexican distillery, Bacardi y Compania, will be brought in later
this year.
'There are no more fights,' said Adolfo Comas Bacardi, the leader of the
dissident shareholders. 'Now everything is hugs and kisses.'
The row erupted when one group of shareholders, led by Manuel Luis del
Valle, then Bacardi president and now chairman, announced plans to take the
company private.
The main opposition was led by Mr Comas Bacardi on behalf of shareholders
with a combined stake of around 14 per cent. In the ensuing fall-out, Mr
Comas Bacardi lost his job along with his brother and two cousins.
Mr Comas Bacardi and the objectors filed a petition with the US Securities
and Exchange Commission, arguing that the move to privatise the company was
illegal because the company had more than 300 shareholders.
Puerto Rico is a US possession and has to observe federal regulations which
say a private company must have fewer than 300 shareholders. Mr del Valle
contended that when Bacardi went public in the 1960s, those who bought
shares kept them for long-term investment and that there was little trading
of the shares anyway.
Fearing a loss of control of the conglomerate, Mr Comas Bacardi's group
split some of their shares, putting about Dollars 10m of Bacardi stock into
238 family trusts to ensure that the number of shareholders was more than
300.
In supporting the move towards privatisation, Mr del Valle had argued that
it was not worth spending Dollars 250,000 to comply with SEC disclosure
regulations. Also the board felt shareholders were deriving little benefit
from Bacardi's status as a public company.
Mr Comas Bacardi contended, however, that the cost of reporting to the SEC
was not the reason for the move towards privatisation. Rather, he said,
privatisation would remove the need for reporting almost anything, allowing
Bacardi to become involved in mergers and acquisitions, and the sale of its
subsidiaries, without any real debate.
The stalemate was broken last month after meetings between the shareholders
and the SEC. The faction which objected to privatisation changed its
position and was rewarded by concessions, including two positions on the
board of directors, and first call on any new offering of shares.
A less bellicose Mr Comas Bacardi has said that the differences which led to
the row were 'philosophical' in nature.
Company officials said the changes will save the Bacardi conglomerate about
Dollars 15m per year in administrative costs, including the costs of
reporting to the SEC. The trusts which were created by the dissident
shareholders are being voluntarily cancelled and will be deregistered by the
SEC. The resolution of the dispute, and the restructuring of the company, is
expected to end some anxiety in parts of the Puerto Rican administration.
Had the company been damaged by the row, it would have had an adverse effect
on the island's finances.
Bacardi accounts for almost all of the 20m proof gallons of rum shipped
annually from Puerto Rico to the US. The shipments are important not only
for Bacardi's earnings. Certain taxes collected on Puerto Rican rum entering
the mainland are returned to the island, and the Puerto Rican administration
earned just over Dollars 230m from the rebates in 1990.
Bacardi Corporation in Puerto Rico recorded sales of over Dollars 660m last
year. The company is a major client of the government-owned shipping line
and of suppliers of bottles.
One economist in Puerto Rico said the restructuring of Bacardi should make
the company stronger, and allow it to fight competition for its US market
share.

FT  13 JUN 92 / International Company News: Lufthansa in talks with Aeroflot
on Moscow plan
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BERLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
LUFTHANSA, the German national carrier, is in advanced negotiations with
Aeroflot, the Russian airline, to form a new joint airline venture based in
Moscow in competition with a rival Russian project being set up by British
Airways.
Mr Jurgen Weber, Lufthansa's chairman, yesterday confirmed at a Financial
Times aviation conference that his airline was holding 'intensive talks'
with Aeroflot and was hoping to reach an agreement 'in the next few months'.
Apart from Aeroflot, Lufthansa is looking for other partners in the
Commonwealth of Independent States to participate in the venture.
The project would revive an historic joint airline venture between Germany
and Russia called Deruluft which operated air services between Berlin and
Moscow in the 1920s.
The new airline would be based at Moscow's Sheremetyevo 1 airport where
Lufthansa is leading a consortium involved in a Dollars 800m modernisation
programme.
The plans envisage initially the new airline will operate international
services from Moscow using western aircraft and eventually shuttle services
in the CIS.
However, Mr Weber warned there were still difficult issues to resolve to
enable the venture to go ahead, especially in view of the economic and
political problems Russia is facing.
The new venture would be in competition with BA's plans to set up a new
international airline based in Moscow called Air Russia with Russian
partners. Sir Colin Marshall, BA's chief executive, told the FT conference
he expected Air Russia to start operations in 1994 or possibly even earlier,
also using western aircraft.
Lufthansa and BA are currently involved in a fierce battle on the German
market and their respective Russian ventures are likely to intensify
competition between the two carriers.
Since German unification, Lufthansa has re-established itself in a big way
in Berlin and has expanded in eastern European markets. Mr Weber said the
airline was the leader in eastern Europe.
Apart from the proposed new Russian-German joint airline venture, Lufthansa
is involved in hotel projects in Moscow and provides training for Russian
airline crew.

FT  13 JUN 92 / International Company News: Stora turns in steep profits
fall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
STORA, Europe's largest paper and pulp group, yesterday announced a steep
fall in profits for the first four months of 1992 following a drop in sales
from SKr18.3bn (Dollars 3.18bn) to SKr16.2bn.
Profits after net financial items for the four months were SKr3m compared
with SKr901m for the same period of 1991.
The company warned it would suffer a loss in the second four-month period
but it added that a continuation of Stora's rationalisation programme to cut
costs combined with an improved market should enable profits to improve for
the final four months of 1992.
Stora said it hopes the full impact of its cutbacks would be apparent by the
latter part of this year with estimated savings of around SKr2bn, mainly due
to a 6,000 cut in the company's 45,000 workforce.
The company blamed three factors for the sharp fall in sales and profits.
Firstly, there were sharp price cuts in most forestry industry related
products, the result of severe competition in a depressed market which had
produced a loss of SKr1.2bn.
Secondly, construction-related revenues fell SKr300m due to the slump in the
building industry with resulting falls in volume sales and price cutting.
Thirdly, there was a decline in the company's net financial items as a
result of lower interest differentials caused by the linking of the Swedish
kroner to the European currency unit (Ecu) in May 1991.
In its analysis of current markets, Stora said there was continued
favourable growth in its forest industries sector with a 2.5 per cent
increase in deliveries during the first four months of pulp, paper and
board, while deliveries of sawn timber rose by 28 per cent.
The company made actual operating losses in the first four months of SKr149m
in pulp and SKr119m in printing papers, compared with profits of SKr56m and
SKr226m respectively. Stora's operating profit for packaging board and paper
was SKr465m, against SKr470m.
Discussing its financial position, the company said its total
interest-bearing net debt fell by SKr555m to SKr24.2bn by the end of April.
Esselte, the office equipment group, has reported a steep increase in
profits for the first four months of 1992, despite reduced turnover. After
net financial items, profits jumped to SKr140m from SKr63m a year ago. Sales
were SKr4.49bn, against SKr5.31bn.
Esselte expects to achieve profits after net financial items of SKr350m for
the full year. Hit by heavy restructuring costs the group made a loss of
SKr416m last time.

STATE Bank of India, India's largest public investment bank, is to set aside
Dollars 250m to cover possible losses in the fallout from the country's
worst financial scandal, AP-DJ reports from Bombay.
The government-owned State Bank has agreed to honour liabilities arising
from illegal securities transactions with a leading Bombay stockbroker, bank
officials said.
The broker, Harshad Mehta, has been accused of illegally using bank money to
manipulate stocks.
The Reserve Bank of India, the central bank, ordered the State Bank two
weeks ago to account for Dollars 250m that it had received in crossed
cheques from the National Housing Bank.
Both the State Bank and Housing Bank are subsidiaries of the central bank.
According to police reports, the State Bank credited the money in securities
to Mehta.
Losses by at least nine banks, including Standard Chartered Bank Australia.
and ANZ Grindlays, totalled an estimated Dollars 1.1bn. Except for two small
Indian banks which went bankrupt, the banks were expected to shore up enough
funds to protect their investors.
The State Bank said it could bear the loss of Dollars 250m, even though that
was more than six times the bank's 1990 profits.

FT  13 JUN 92 / UK Company News: BET profits may be slashed under accounting
guidelines
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRE-TAX profits at BET, the business services group, could have been almost
wiped out by exceptional charges when the group reports its annual figures
on Monday.
Profit are expected to have fallen from Pounds 215m in the year to March
1991 to about Pounds 110m before exceptional charges which the highest
market estimates place at about Pounds 50m.
Due to changes in accounting treatment introduced by Mr Robert Mackenzie,
the new finance director, exceptional charges could be almost double this
figure.
The market is already expecting a halved total dividend, which will barely
be covered by earnings, following a tough year in joinery, personnel and
plant hire.
Mr Mackenzie joined BET in December and is understood to have chosen to make
substantial write-downs in the value of net assets such as plant and
buildings above the line.
The majority of the exceptional items are believed to be non-cash items.
BET is one of the first sizeable companies to report using new guidelines
suggested by the Urgent Issues task force of the Accounting Standards Board.
As a result it is likely to be reporting extremely large extraordinary
charges relating to goodwill previously written off on acquisition of
businesses which now has to be passed back through the profit an loss
account when those businesses are subsequently sold. This treatment is
designed to demonstrate the true profit or loss on sales of businesses.
Since Mr Nicholas Wills resigned as chief executive in April 1991, Mr John
Clark, his replacement, and the new team have been trying to reverse the
errors that led BET in 1991 to its first earnings decline in a decade.

FT  13 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Eye-opener leaves management in tatters -
Paul Abrahams examines the background to Fisons' surprise profits warning
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FISONS, the former fertilisers group, is back in the mire.
A profit warning yesterday sent shares in the Ipswich-based pharmaceuticals
and scientific instruments group tumbling.
In a statement, Mr Patrick Egan, group chairman, warned that profits for the
first six months were likely to be less than half of last year's total of
Pounds 95.2m.
Excuses were coming thick and fast yesterday, but analysts have become
increasingly disinclined to believe them.
In March Mr Egan said he was confident most of the group's difficulties lay
behind it. After only four months the credibility of the new management is
in tatters. The company's future independence is increasingly in doubt.
The profits fall may have been a nasty surprise, admits Mr Cedric Scroggs,
chief executive, but the reasons for the shortfall are not new.
On the revenue side the company continues to suffer from the US withdrawal
in 1989 of Opticrom, its eye treatment, and in 1990 of Imferon, a blood
product. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) asked for the withdrawals
following quality control concerns.
Both products remain off the market. FDA officials visited the offending
site in April. In spite of massive investments by Fisons they failed to
clear the drug and made further observations about Opticrom's manufacturing
processes.
Opticrom is now unlikely to be relicensed in time for the US rag-weed season
which starts in August. Six to eight weeks will be needed to feed the
product through the distribution channels.
As for Imferon, Mr Scroggs has hired external consultants to decide whether
it is worth the Pounds 25m to Pounds 30m necessary to upgrade production to
FDA standards.
Meanwhile, the company admitted yesterday that other products had also been
hit because of manufacturing difficulties.
'The new technical management are determined not to continue production at
plants which fail to manufacture at the best possible standards. We want to
make sure that none of our products have any further regulatory problems.
This has had an effect on sales during May and June,' says Mr Scroggs.
As a result, both Tilade, an asthma drug, and Opticrom have been in short
supply outside the US, he admits. UK distributors have complained recently
that Tilade is virtually impossible to find. Norton Healthcare, a subsidiary
of Ivax of the US, launched a generic version of Intal this month costing 20
per cent less. The group says its new product is selling exceptionally well.
Meanwhile, Fisons' volume short-fall has coincided with an increase in costs
associated with fixing the quality control issues, says Mr Scroggs.
In addition, the scientific equipment division, where Mr Scroggs made his
reputation before he was appointed chief executive in April, is also
suffering from a shortfall in sales. However, Mr Scroggs insists the
division is not in trouble and has genuinely good prospects.
Fisons's management is desperately in need of good news. Last month the
company announced it wanted to sell its horticultural and consumer health
businesses. Analysts fear the present difficulties may undermine the price
Fisons can generate for the businesses. Previous estimates valued them at
between Pounds 300m and Pounds 400m.
Mr Scroggs denies he is in a hurry to sell the divisions, insisting the
company is financially strong and not short of cash. There is no need for
fire-sales, he argues.
He says the confidential memoranda describing the divisions will be
published by the first week in July and negotiations should then start with
a number of companies that have already signed confidentiality agreements.
Mr Scroggs says these groups are serious and not 'tire-kickers.'
If good news fails to materialise and the share price falls low enough, some
analysts believe the group could be vulnerable to a takeover.
However, contested takeovers in the pharmaceuticals industry are virtually
unknown because so much of their value is dependent upon employees who might
be alienated in a messy contested bid.
A friendly takeover is more likely, especially as few companies are likely
to want to acquire a business like Fisons without knowing the full extent of
its difficulties. However, Mr Egan has publicly said he is not interested in
such a deal.
Given that a hostile bid is unlikely and a friendly one publicly rejected,
shareholders must be wondering how the company extricates itself from its
present predicament.
The full extent of the sales shortfall is still unclear from the statement.
Opticrom had sales of only Dollars 40m (Pounds 22m) before it was withdrawn.
Questions must be asked whether it is worth the effort of bringing the
product back to market.
Given that none of the board have any experience in pharmaceuticals it is
far from clear whether it has the expertise to judge the issue. One thing is
clear, the relaunch of Opticrom will be the most expensive in
pharmaceuticals history.

FT  13 JUN 92 / UK Company News: BM bid for Thwaites is referred to the MMC
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR MICHAEL Heseltine, the secretary of state for trade and industry,
yesterday referred to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission the proposed
acquisition of Thwaites, the Leamington Spa-based site dumper company, by BM
Group, the construction equipment manufacturer.
It is thought that BM consulted the Office of Fair Trading confidentially
over whether it would run into problems with the proposed purchase but that
in order for OFT to ascertain this, it could not remain confidential.
The DTI considers that it 'raises competition issues in the supply of site
dumpers in the UK'. Beyond that official statement, its press office could
throw little light on the referral.
The combined BM/Thwaites group would have between 80 and 85 per cent of the
UK site dumper market, though Thwaites currently has about 50 per cent in
dumpers with  3/4 to 8 tonnes payload.
However Mr Roger Shute, chairman of BM, said the two companies make
different types of dumper - for example BM's are two wheel drive and
Thwaites' are four.
And he claimed that in areas where BM was weak, Thwaites was strong and vice
versa.
He was not surprised by the referral but added that it ran across the idea
of looking beyond the UK market to Europe and the rest of the world.
He would be most interested in Thwaites' export side. Only about 20 per cent
of BM's business is in the UK.
Also BM had not made a firm offer; bids for Thwaites had been invited and a
handful of companies are on the shortlist.
Because of this Mr John Webb, managing director of Thwaites, said he was
unable to comment at this stage.
The MMC will make its report by September 11.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
NEOTRONICS Technology, the measuring instrument manufacturer, reported
profits of Pounds 1.14m pre-tax for the six months to March 31.
The outcome, down from Pounds 1.51m at the same stage of the previous year,
took in losses of Pounds 66,000 from Laser Monitoring, acquired last May,
and Pounds 308,000 from Solomat Instrumentation, purchased at the beginning
of this year.
Exceptional charges of Pounds 106,000 related to redundancy and
reorganisation costs at Solomat.
Turnover of the enlarged group was Pounds 9.29m (Pounds 7.9m). Earnings per
share dipped to 2.77p (4.05p) but the interim dividend goes up to 0.85p
(0.8p).

FT  13 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Staveley questions wisdom of new salt price
restriction
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR BRIAN Kent, chairman of Staveley Industries, yesterday said the tighter
restrictions on salt prices announced earlier this week could force the UK's
two producers to move increasingly away from basic bulk white salt.
On Thursday the Department of Trade and Industry announced that price
increases, restricted since 1987 to the rise in production costs minus 1 per
cent, would be tightened to production cost growth less 2 per cent until
1997.
Mr Kent said this could force producers to concentrate on higher added value
products such as water softening agents and dishwasher pellets, which are
not affected by the restraints.
Salt continued to be Staveley's best-performing business in the year to
April 4 when pre-tax profits fell almost 14 per cent to Pounds 24.2m. Sales
declined 10 per cent to Pounds 298.3m.
The largest decline came in the weighing division, where the operating
return tumbled 39 per cent to Pounds 8.1m amid start-up problems with a
German factory and the collapse in defence-related business.
Earnings per share, depressed by the Pounds 27m rights issue in June 1991,
fell from 20.6p to 16.6p. The final dividend is maintained at 5.9p, for a
total of 8.2p (8.2p).
COMMENT
About the only disappointment in these results was Brian Kent's failure to
pull a new chief executive out of his magic hat. Salt continues to come up
with the cash, and mechanical and electrical engineering is remarkably
resilient. Measurement shows good prospects for recovery, when one
eventually comes. The risks are that the German factory proves a deeper
thorn than thought, and the measurement order book takes longer than planned
to rebuild. But even so, forecasts ranging from Pounds 24m to Pounds 28m
make the shares - on a prospective p/e of 11 - look good value.

FT  13 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Increased loss at Owen &amp; Robinson
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OWEN &amp; Robinson, the jewellery and sports shoe retailer, reported an
increase in pre-tax losses from Pounds 638,000 to Pounds 2.9m for the year
to January 31, and again is not paying a final dividend.
It was also announced yesterday that Mr Maurice Dwek, chairman, had resigned
as head of Arlen, the electricals group, and was expected to devote more
time to O&amp;R.
Mr Dwek, who ran Dwek Group, a mini-conglomerate, and set up Seaforth
Investments, an industrial investment group, has brought in new management
at O&amp;R. Mr Alan Gaynor, who ran the Underwoods chemist chain, and Mr Mike
Smith, formerly finance director of Laura Ashley, arrived in April.
Mr Gaynor said yesterday that they had already identified and removed
overheads, saving Pounds 1m in a full year. This had involved 100
redundancies. He said the core Gold Centre business was sound but had
expanded too fast, almost doubling in size last year.
As a result, group sales rose 45 per cent to Pounds 26.3m in 1991-92.
However, gross profits were held back by price cutting in the all-important
Christmas period.
Exceptional costs of Pounds 832,000 and an extraordinary debit of Pounds
1.15m (Pounds 5.48m), the dividends on the preference shares and the cost of
the 0.15p interim dividend, meant a transfer from reserves of Pounds 5m
(Pounds 6.9m). Losses per share were 11.62p (8.08p).

<TEXT>
CONTROL Techniques, the electronic drives and controls group, yesterday
announced the sale of its loss-making process control division for Pounds
350,000 to Coreci of France.
This would allow it to concentrate on its automation and variable speed
drive business. As part of the sale, Coreci will also take on Pounds 1.2m of
third party debt.
In the year to September 30 1991 the division incurred pre-tax losses of
Pounds 480,000; its net assets were Pounds 992,000.
Control Techniques also announced its results for the half year to March 31
1992, showing pre-tax profits ahead from Pounds 1.1m to Pounds 1.57m.
The group, 29.9 per cent owned by Emerson of the US, increased turnover to
Pounds 43.2m (Pounds 29.9m).
Earnings per share were unchanged at 2.3p and the interim dividend stays at
2.15p.

FT  13 JUN 92 / Letter: Unfair picture presented of water services'
operational and investment activities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr WILLIAM COURTNEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The director-general of water services last Tuesday published a
considered and objective report which highlighted an increase in complaints.
He made it clear that the increase was low - four in every 10,000 households
or 0.04 per cent. He also stated that there was no evidence to link this
increase to any decline in standards of service.
However, the media fastened on the increase and went on to link this with
high profits, high prices and high salaries. With only a few exceptions, the
media presented a picture of monopolies failing the nation whose customers
could look only to the director-general for protection.
This picture is a travesty of the truth.
The facts are that standards of service and water quality are higher than
ever before and still improving. Investment is higher in real terms than at
any time in the past 100 years, with nearly 100 per cent of works now
meeting the standards currently required.
Discharges to bathing waters will meet the current standards by 1995 or soon
after.
Over 70 per cent of profits are reinvested. Amounts distributed to
shareholders are less than were previously paid in interest to government.
Prices are rising solely to pay for higher investment. Top salaries and
other perquisites are less than in other businesses of comparable size.
The positive change in attitudes to customers between the previous
authorities and privatised companies is very marked, as demonstrated in
their own market research and also the recent customer survey carried out
for the director general by MORI.
We now have highly effective, efficient, profitable water companies,
providing higher standards of service. We have left behind companies which
were under-resourced, under-invested and subject to constant political
interference.
From 1947 the public and parliament groaned at the burden of inefficient,
loss-making, nationalised industries. We now have a model that is
successful. Our best inventions are said always to be derided at home and
exploited abroad. Is this now going to happen with privatisation?
We ask only that the media and the public look at the facts and judge us
fairly on performance. Such an objective appraisal would lead any reasonable
person to welcome the new model of private water companies under public
regulation and to encourage the companies to get on and complete the job
they have started so successfully.

FT  13 JUN 92 / Letter: More explicit rules of behaviour for utilities'
regulators needed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Lord SKELMERSDALE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your leader 'Time to review the regulators' (June 10) is right to call
for a review of the regulatory process, but not for one quango, the Office
of Fair Trading, to review a series of others, namely the regulators. Only
the sponsoring government departments the Department of Trade and Industry
and the Department of the Environment, acting in concert, can do the job
effectively.
There are, though, other reasons for a review, beyond those you state. The
proper role of the utility regulators is to balance the interests of the
customer with those of the company's shareholders. The regulator should act
as the referee, carefully and impartially enforcing clearly stated rules
which are agreed between the utilities and the regulators for periods in
excess of one year.
Unfortunately the rules of the regulatory game are vague and the regulators
have huge discretion over how they apply their powers. Their unpredictable
intervention is now increasing the uncertainty in the utility industries.
The regulated companies will be reluctant to invest where the risks are
rising but the returns are eroded. And investment in Britain's
infrastructure is not something we should allow the regulators to deter,
however unintentionally. They must be mindful of the needs of future
customers as well as the wishes of today's.
Any inquiry into the regulators must therefore recognise that more explicit
rules of regulatory behaviour are needed to provide a more stable business
environment. It must also recognise that utilities need an adequate rate of
return to encourage investment in the hugely expensive, long-term capital
projects that are so important to this country's competitive position.
If unchecked, the present short-sighted approach will damage the interests
of customers - the very people the regulators so publicly claim to be
protecting.

FT  13 JUN 92 / While the cat's away . . .: Ivo Dawnay says that renewed
agitation among the Tories over Europe is more than a passing storm
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If 50,000 Danes had opted to stay in bed one day last week, the British
parliament would still be dozing in its post-election doldrums. Mr John
Major, the prime minister, would be undisturbed on his Latin American tour
and 'the end of politics' would still be a viable, if dog-eared, topic for
idea-starved pundits.
Instead, MPs have had some of their most excitable 10 days since Mrs
Margaret Thatcher's resignation in November 1990. A cabinet minister has
felt obliged to take the drastic step of issuing a statement of loyalty to
his absent leader and the Conservatives' grudging acceptance of the
Maastricht Treaty is eroding like a sand castle in a typhoon.
Meanwhile, the treaty's two keenest advocates have been virtually
incommunicado: the prime minister abroad and Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign
minister, observing the protocol that demands he keep perfect media silence
on the Queen's state visit to France.
With the bosses away, Conservative whips have been unable to staunch a Babel
of opinionated voices on the implications of the Danish 'no'. At a cocktail
party in Whitehall this week, senior ministers did their best to appear
philosophical. One veteran of numerous Euro-controversies concluded: 'There
is no solution, not today, not tomorrow . . . but eventually we shall reach
one.'
Perhaps. But few in Westminster would describe this latest Euro-crisis as a
passing storm. The forthcoming Lisbon summit of EC heads of government and
the summer parliamentary recess at best offer Mr Major a lull for
contemplation. But the task ahead - to unite his party and simultaneously
keep the European Community moving forward through the UK's six-month
presidency, which begins next month - poses real difficulties.
If the prime minister fails, he could by Christmas be leader of a bitterly
divided party with his reputation as a conciliator - and the Maastricht
Treaty - in ruins, and with Britain back in the slow lane of a two-speed
Europe.
To some Tories, the Danes have changed everything. By boldly challenging Mr
Jacques Delors' vision of Europe, they have also defied the UK government's
claim that there is no alternative to the Maastricht compromise.
For the first time, Mr Major is being portrayed by his followers as not in
the centre, but on the Europhile wing of his party and as such dangerously
exposed. One usually loyalist MP commented that the leadership had 'totally
misjudged the mood' in the party. 'Up until the Danes, we were voting for
what we were told was the best deal available in the circumstances - that we
were boxed in,' he said.
'We were also sold the treaty on grounds that all 12 countries have to agree
it. Now one country has not, it is a totally new ball game.'
That view is now so widespread that the Danish question - 'to ratify, or not
to ratify' - is no longer appropriate. In spite of Mr Hurd's undertaking at
a meeting of EC foreign ministers last week to press on with ratification,
the question has now to be hedged with the rider 'but not yet'.
Privately, the Tory party's backroom number-crunchers know that, in its
present mood, there is no chance of getting the Maastricht Bill through the
House of Commons. Last month, 22 Tory MPs voted against the bill's second
reading. By Thursday, 87 MPs had signed a motion calling for 'a fresh start'
aimed at creating a European Economic Community and a common market.
Their view that the UK can now use its presidency to promote a
non-federalist blueprint for a Europe of free trading nations has been
deemed naive by Mr Major's camp. Yet the signatories to the motion are
tacitly backed by more formidable party figures, from ex-cabinet ministers
Mr Kenneth Baker and Mr John Biffen to current cabinet members. Whatever
their claims to the contrary, Mr Peter Lilley, Mr Michael Portillo and Mr
Norman Lamont are all associated with the heresy.
With Labour poised to use the Danish vote as a pretext to oppose
ratification of the treaty, just 30 rebel Tory votes against a guillotine
motion - limiting the time for debate in order to head off a filibuster on
the bill - could kill it forever.
The threat to oppose the guillotine will not be issued publicly by the now
more organised, subtle and broadly based anti-Maastricht lobby. Rather than
hectoring, Mr Michael Spicer, the urbane former energy minister heading the
resistance, suggests that the treaty simply be put to one side. Britain
would then pursue its presidency aims of completing the single market and
promoting EC enlargement.
Arguing that the UK's goals mesh well with those of the Efta and central
European states applying to join the Community, Mr Spicer says that those
who want a Euro-superstate must take that step on their own. 'The agenda
should switch back to what it was before the Commission was allowed to take
it over. The tide of history may have turned, and may be moving at last in
Britain's direction.'
So far, government loyalists have decided to roll with the punches. But
there is a strong pro-Maastricht lobby which would like the whips to give
what is seen as an over-cocky new intake a crash course in Westminster
Realpolitik.
While the tough Mr Richard Ryder, chief whip, plays it hard, the emollient
Mr Major will explain more delicately the dangers of a two-speed Europe over
whisky and soda at Number 10.
In the meantime, the government hopes that Thursday's Irish referendum, the
Lisbon summit later this month and the French plebiscite in September may
throw up new options and cool the headstrong at home and abroad.
Several experienced hands believe that, with minor adjustments, the status
quo ante can still prevail. A new commitment by the Commission to devolve
powers back to national capitals, a declaration by the 12 to that effect,
and a symbolic UK victory - say, on the right to maintain border controls -
and opinion could turn back quickly, they say.
Yet there are no guarantees. Mr Major cannot easily repudiate a treaty he
hailed as a triumph. But a trial of strength with the hard-line rebels - an
appeal to 'trust me' - could turn retabling the Maastricht Bill into a vote
of confidence he cannot afford to lose.
If luck is not with him the prime minister may be forced to choose between
his obligations as EC president and his need to keep his party behind him.
Most believe that of the two, the party takes priority. 'Whips,' said one
old Westminster hand this week, 'know not to allow anything to go to the
vote if there is the slightest danger that they might not have the verdict
sewn up.'
Like a besuited Sisyphus, Mr Major has just seen the rock he so
painstakingly pushed up the mountain to the April 9 general election, tumble
back to the bottom. An idle summer in England's cricket pavilions is no
longer on the cards.

FT  13 JUN 92 / The next cold war: Ice-cream makers are in dispute
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GUY DE JONQUIERES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is not yet high summer, but the temperature is nearing boiling point in
Europe's ice-cream industry, where competition for the Pounds 6bn market has
erupted into an acrimonious legal battle of the kind which keeps lawyers in
Savile Row suits.
The conflict has set Unilever, the big Anglo-Dutch consumer products group
which dominates the business, against Mars, maker of chocolate bars, petfood
and Uncle Ben's rice, which has shaken up the previously sedate world of ice
cream since it stormed into the market three years ago.
Invective is flying. Unilever executives describe Mars as a 'pirate', while
managers of the private US company have shed their habitual secrecy to
condemn Unilever as a greedy giant bent on freezing newcomers out of the
market.
At the heart of the dispute is control of distribution. This is a vital
competitive weapon in every area of food manufacturing but is particularly
important in ice cream, which must be kept refrigerated from factory to
shop.
Hostilities first broke out two years ago, when Unilever obtained a court
injunction in Ireland preventing Mars ice cream from being stocked in retail
freezer cabinets owned by Unilever. Mars appealed on the grounds that, by
excluding rival products from its freezers, the Anglo-Dutch group was
infringing EC competition rules. But two weeks ago the Irish High Court
rejected the appeal.
Meanwhile, Mars had opened up a second front by complaining to the European
Commission about Unilever's freezer arrangements and about agreements used
by Langnese-Iglo, a Unilever subsidiary, and Scholler, another big
manufacturer, to exclude competitors from German retail outlets.
In March, the Commission suspended until the end of the year the German
retailer agreements, saying they would 'seriously and irreparably damage'
Mars's business. It also promised to investigate the exclusive freezer
arrangements which, it believed, restricted competition.
Langnese and Scholler then appealed to the European Court of Justice, which
last month lifted the Commission's suspension of the German retailer
agreements while its learned members took time to acquaint themselves with
the finer points of the ice-cream business. Yesterday, the court confirmed
its suspension of the Commission order, but opened 18,000 German petrol
stations to Mars freezers.
As the peak ice-cream season gets under way - mid-June to mid-August - the
main theatre of battle has shifted to the market.
The summer trade depends heavily on 'impulse' sales, traditionally from
small retail outlets, as opposed to 'take-home' purchases made in larger
quantities at supermarkets. Mars has successfully penetrated the latter
market, where exclusive freezer arrangements do not apply, but seeks future
growth from impulse buys.
Though these are less than half of ice-cream consumption by volume, they
represent two-thirds of the value. That difference owes a lot to a recent
shift towards higher-priced ice cream pioneered by Mars. Haagen-Dazs has
recently taken the process a step further by creating a 'super-premium'
market for even pricier ice cream.
Mars's stroke of genius was to invent a market by developing ice-cream
versions of its chocolate bars, which sell in the UK for about 60p. Their
success has prompted traditional ice-cream makers, including Unilever,
Scholler and Nestle, to launch rival products.
Mars has built a Pounds 40m ice-cream factory near Strasbourg, eastern
France, from which to supply the whole of Europe. But to be economic, the
50,000-tonne capacity plant needs large production volumes, which means big
sales.
Mars owns 14,000 non-exclusive retail freezer cabinets, mainly in the UK,
and also has agreements to use freezers owned by rivals such as Clarke Foods
in Britain. But Mars says it is costly to maintain its own freezers just to
sell eight products. In any case, the company says, many small shops have
room for only one freezer, which is often already supplied by Unilever.
Simon Bullimore, UK managing director of Mars, argues that Unilever is
unfairly weighting the odds against smaller rivals. 'It means only big
competitors with a full range of products can enter the market,' he says.
Unilever ripostes that such protestations sound hollow from a company with
sales of more than Dollars 9bn a year. Furthermore, Unilever says its
freezers are its property, in which it has invested large sums to buy and
maintain. 'If Mars get a free ride in our freezers, the next thing they'll
want is to use our factories,' snorts one executive.
In any case, he says, the purpose of keeping cabinets exclusive is not to
restrict competition but to ensure that products reach consumers in good
condition and to simplify stock control. Predictably, Mars scoffs at such
arguments.
Each side says it will fight the legal battle to the end and insists it is
confident of emerging victorious. Given that the wheels of Brussels
bureaucracy and EC justice can turn exceedingly slowly, many more months are
likely to pass before the ice-cream war is finally decided. But as Europe
prepares to head for the beaches, Commission officials and European Court
judges dealing with the case can at least look forward to the prospect of
some enjoyable first-hand research.

FT  13 JUN 92 / Letter: Sure way to demoralise trainees
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From A H J MILLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, In all the comment on the activities of the National Council for
Vocational Qualifications, no mention seems to have been made of the effect
of delays in implementing NVQs on those who are meant to have been
benefiting - the trainees themselves.
I have been helping a client planning to introduce NVQs across the complete
spectrum of his employees. Encouraged by a grant obtained through the local
Training and Enterprise Council, and committed to the principle of a better
trained workforce, the company started young trainees on Level 1 last autumn
in a pilot scheme.
They are now reaching the stage when they should be assessed on at least
part of their work. Considerable time and money has been invested to ensure
that trainers have been trained, assessors accredited (a pre-condition of
the grant), and the whole workforce involved in planning a wider programme
to cover everyone.
We were assured by the industry lead body, which has been helping in the
training, that standards would be set and assessment processes validated by
the end of March. Enthusiasm and commitment has been generated at all
levels. We now learn that not only has the date slipped, but that we may not
have approved procedures even by the year end.
It is difficult to discover who is to blame. What is of equal concern is
that no-one outside the company seems to be worried or surprised. In the
meantime, we are faced with the consequences of much wasted effort and a
potentially demoralised staff, whose enthusiasm will be that much more
difficult to re-kindle. What price now the government's undertaking that 80
per cent of the national workforce would be covered by NVQs in 1992?

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mrs JAQUINE DU C ARNOLD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, In your article 'Revlon to sell 20m shares in move to pay down debts'
(May 27) you described Charles Revson as 'Revlon's eccentric founder'.
The only inaccuracy in this description with which I would venture to take
issue is that he might more correctly be described as co-founder. Some of
your lady readers may recall the name of one of Revlon's more famous scents
 -'The Two Charlies' - a recognition of my late husband Charles Lachman's
role.
He provided the initial capital and was the chemist who, with a painter's
eye for colour, mixed the nail varnish from the chemicals and other
ingredients he had devised, in a bath tub in Florida with an intrigued
Revson looking on.
Charles Lachman was retiring and modest, always giving full credit to the
energetic marketing genius of Charles Revson, and he stood back in later
years from the corporate affairs of Revson.
Nevertheless, without his foresight, chemical training and financial backing
Revlon could not have been founded as it was - he took quiet pride in the
fact that the 'L' in Revlon stood (and still stands) for his surname,
Lachman.

FT  13 JUN 92 / Full throttle for a turbulent take-off: John Plender on GPA,
the aircraft-leasing company, ahead of its flotation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN PLENDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Such is the complexity of the business of GPA Group, the world's largest
aircraft-leasing concern, that a flotation would have posed problems at the
best of times. As it is, the the worldwide sale of nearly 30 per cent of the
enlarged ordinary share capital of this unusual company coincides with
massive oversupply in the aircraft market and a shortage of credit for
aircraft purchasers.
The combined placing power of Nomura, Yamaichi, Goldman Sachs, Merrill
Lynch, Salomon Brothers, Schroders, BZW, Swiss Bank Corporation, plus
further supporting cast, will no doubt propel GPA off the ground. Depending
on the striking price, which will be fixed at between Dollars 10 and Dollars
12.50 by the global co-ordinator Nomura International when all the
applications are in, the group will be capitalised at up to Dollars 3.56bn
(Pounds 1.94bn). Yet many mainstream investment institutions remain uneasy
about this Shannon-based phenomenon, which is making no profit or dividend
forecast two and a half months into its financial year. A stampede is
unlikely in London before Tuesday's final deadline for UK and Irish
applications for the shares.
This may seem a mite ungenerous to the company and its founder Mr Tony Ryan.
For an outfit that leases aircraft to predominantly Third World customers to
have declared only a marginal reduction in profits from Dollars 281m to
Dollars 279m (Pounds 152m) last year is a remarkable tribute to the
resourcefulness of the management and just 317 employees.
Nor are the frequent comparisons made between GPA's business and computer
leasing very relevant. The risk of sudden obsolescence, which was the ruin
of Atlantic Computers, is less worrying in a heavily regulated industry with
long lead times like aircraft manufacturing. GPA's fleet consists chiefly of
modern aircraft whose second hand values have held up better than those of
older craft in the present market slump.
That said, the strain of keeping the show on the road in difficult times is
writ large across the offer document. Even allowing for the fact that GPA's
international share offer has had to satisfy the tough requirements of the
Securities and Exchange Commission for cautionary statements, the caveats
are formidable.
The first question mark that hangs over GPA is: how does a company with net
assets of less than Dollars 2bn and borrowings of more than twice that level
finance aircraft orders of Pounds 11.9bn over the rest of the decade, rising
to Pounds 20.9bn if options are thrown in? The offer document bluntly states
that:
'there can be no assurance . . . that adequate sources of capital will be
available to fund the group's aircraft commitments';
'the directors believe that there is limited scope for the company to
arrange additional syndicated credit facilities with commercial banks'; and
the decline in the number of aircraft sold last year reflects 'the relative
lack of finance available for purchasers in such transactions'.
Against that background the directors have only been able to say that bank
and other credit facilities are enough to fund the group's requirements to
June 30 1993. It is an uncomfortable fact that GPA's very rapid profits
growth from Dollars 107m to Dollars 279m in the five years to March 1992
(see chart) owed much to a climate of easy credit. In the present credit
squeeze the group has shifted the financing emphasis from the banking system
to the markets. Not only has it issued debt and commercial paper across the
world; it has even sold future amounts receivable on operating leases. The
picture that emerges is one of hand-to-mouth financing - this after the
cancellation and rescheduling of aircraft deliveries on undisclosed terms.
The profit and loss account is under similar pressure. GPA derives its
revenues from two main sources. One is leasing aircraft to airlines, which
then pay GPA the equivalent of rent. The other is the sale of aircraft to
groups of investors from whom GPA then leases the aircraft back before
granting a sublease to an airline that operates the plane. A further 15 per
cent of sales proceeds comes from sales direct to airlines. Continuing
aircraft sales are essential in providing part of the cash flow to meet
future capital commitments.
On the leasing side the number of non-revenue earning aircraft in the fleet
has gone up to more than 10 per cent of the total and lease rates are weak
because of the difficult trading conditions in aviation. Margins have
declined, as they have on aircraft sales, in the past year.
A number of airlines which have leased aircraft from GPA are in , eight
lessees were deferring payments for rent, maintenance and fees. Meantime the
formal documents state that the problems of America West Airlines, which is
in Chapter 11 bankruptcy in the US and has 16 of GPA's A320 aircraft on
sublease, could lead to a significant loss. This tale of woe is accompanied
by a statement that the directors believe that these unfavourable trading
conditions will continue at least until the end of the current financial
year next March.
This brings us to the question of the quality of earnings. GPA's leasing
operations last year accounted for nearly 30 per cent of gross profits; but
in reality the contribution is higher, because all the cost of interest,
depreciation and certain taxes are charged to leasing. None are charged to
aircraft sales, the biggest source of revenue, which last year accounted for
57 per cent of gross profit.
In effect GPA is a financial intermediary between the aircraft manufacturers
and the world's smaller airlines. By buying from manufacturers in bulk it
takes the equivamakes a turn when it sells to investors or airlines at close
to market value. But in buying aircraft, it exposes itself to several risks
other than just credit risk. One is that airlines will not come forward to
lease aircraft when GPA takes delivery. Another is that GPA sometimes takes
on a longer head lease from the investors with whom it conducts sale and
leaseback transactions than the sub-lease it extends to the airline. That is
to say, there is a mismatch between the period over which GPA makes payments
to the investors and the much shorter period in which revenues are
receivable from the airline. In the year to March 1993 the company still has
to find lessees for no less than 115 aircraft. In 1994 the figure is not
much less at 97. No small challenge in present conditions.
The striking feature of GPA's profits from aircraft sales, which are
inevitably of lower quality than leasing revenue because of their inherent
one-off nature, is that they are extremely lumpy. The offer document reveals
that sales proceeds tend to derive largely from a single country or market
in any given year. In 1990, for example, the single sale to investors of 12
Airbus A320s that were on operating leases with Braniff of the US, whose
subsequent bankruptcy cost GPA Dollars 110m in provisions, accounted for 31
per cent of all sales revenue that year.
The accountancy, though perfectly legitimate, is less than conservative. GPA
takes all the profit on sale and leaseback deals up front, instead of
spreading the profit over the term of the operating lease. In some sales it
remains at risk in relation to the aircrafts' residual value because it
guarantees to make good any shortfall on a subsequent sale by investors
against stipulated values. No problem at today's values, but what might
happen in future?
The sales are driven, in part, by opportunities for tax avoidance, which
governments are often seeking to plug. Investors are also sensitive to the
fact that aircraft in the early stages of their product life are prone to
developmental problems and tend to have more limited appeal for airlines
than established aircraft. GPA's future orders contain a significant number
of Airbus A-320s, Fokker 100s and McDonnell Douglas MD-11s, which fall into
that category and may thus present placement difficulties in the short and
medium term.
GPA's response to questions about the sustainability of profits from
aircraft sales is that it is constantly finding new ways of turning aircraft
into financial assets for investors. Its final public offer document,
published last week, reveals that it is close to selling 14 aircraft for
Dollars 500m, equivalent to 44 per cent of last year's aircraft sales
revenue, to a fund in which a single US institutional investor has taken a
Dollars 100m equity stake, with the remaining money coming from public and
private debt issues and placements, with GPA providing Dollars 50m-70m
itself. Another such fund is planned shortly.
As far as the growing importance of newer aircraft in the order book is
concerned, the management argues that its skill lies precisely in judging
what investors and airlines will want many years ahead. The threefold growth
in net attributable profits over the past five years lends strength to that
assertion. As for the current trading problems in leasing, the company takes
substantial security in the aircraft that it leases to airlines. It also
identifies and addresses problems early by working closely with its clients
and an effective marketing network around the world means that GPA it is
adept at placing aircraft with other airlines. The fact that its profits
have held up so well is a measure of the management's fleetness of foot in
dealing with problems.
The trouble is that GPA is now of a size where this fast footwork is
becoming harder to sustain, especially in adverse conditions. And there are
big penalties if the growth machine goes into reverse. Under the purchase
agreements with aircraft manufacturers GPA has to repay Dollars 72m of
discounts and credits if it fails to take delivery of further aircraft under
existing contracts. If investors' confidence in GPA's ability to find new
lessees for their planes ever waned, future financing would become a
nightmare.
Tony Ryan and his team deserve all credit for their past achievements. But
this is a high risk share issue that private investors would do well to
shun, even on a maximum price-earnings ratio of 11.8. Many British
institutions, meantime, will be happy to give it a wide berth and leave the
Japanese to make the running.

FT  13 JUN 92 / Man in the News: Risky rise to millionaires' row - Derek
Hunt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The management buy-out craze has produced some pretty strange millionaires,
but perhaps none so unlikely as Derek Hunt, the man about to steer MFI
Furniture back to the stock market with a price tag of Pounds 750m or more.
He will get a Pounds 1.3m bonus when the flotation takes place.
Some of his edges have been smoothed since the boisterous northerner led the
company's management buy-out in 1987. The raggle-taggle of blond curls has
been replaced by a rather more consciously styled, slightly bouffant,
hair-do. And he has caught what he calls the golf bug.
But he celebrated his 53rd birthday last Tuesday with his favourite brew,
Newcastle Brown Ale, provided by one of the brokers to the issue. 'A super
touch,' Hunt says.
There have been times in the years since the buy-out when it looked as
though Hunt would not make it to the million mark at all. Hit by the rise in
interest rates in 1989 - which had the double effect of depressing sales of
furniture and raising the cost of the group's Pounds 500m of debt - MFI did
well to escape the fate of rivals such as Lowndes Queensway, another
leveraged buy-out in the household goods retail market which went into
receivership in 1990.
Despite the trials of heading a retail buy- out in the worst recession since
the 1930's the grammar school boy from Darlington, County Durham, has
retained a genuine warmth and humour.
Asked what he is going to do with his Pounds 1.3m, less 40 per cent tax, he
says that he and John Randall, the finance director, have decided that the
best place for it is the Post Office Savings Bank.
It would be a far safer bet than the Pounds 80,000 investment he made in the
Pounds 718m buy-out of MFI in November 1987. That original stake will give
him between 0.2 and 0.5 per cent of the company's shares depending on the
issue price.
The money could have been lost entirely. 'A year ago it looked as though
there was nothing in it for us,' Hunt says.
He had not mortgaged his house as some of his colleagues did. But, he says,
when you invest heavily in a business you work for, you can lose not only
your savings but your income too. 'And in my case any future prospects of
employment,'
At the outset Hunt and the 350 executives and managers who bought into the
business expected to be able to cash in their investments within three years
 -and to make a big profit. Together they had 3.75 per cent of the company,
which could have risen to more than 25 per cent if targets for the timing
and price of the planned flotation were met.
Because the targets were missed, this group of investors will share between
2 and 5 per cent of the equity, which will be enlarged by the flotation.
Throughout the buy-out period Hunt has felt responsible for his colleagues'
investments. Even while carrying Pounds 500m of debt, Hunt, a man whose
build is reminiscent of his time as a rugby prop forward, says he felt the
responsiblity to the employees was the heavier burden.
'You must remember why we did the buy-out in the first place,' he says.
'Asda put it up for sale.'
The most embarrassing moment in the whole buy-out, Hunt recollects, was when
the recession forced a refinancing in 1989 which involved a rights issue.
Hunt says that he and Randall 'fought tooth and nail' to prevent the staff
investors being asked to put up more of their savings. In the event,
however, this could not be avoided. 'I felt bad about that,' Hunt says.
His loyalty to his staff is returned by a fierce commitment from them. Of
the 9,000 employees, 1,500 have worked for MFI for more than 10 years.
Paul Whitney, chief executive of CIN Management, one of the backers of the
buy-out and now a non-executive director of the group, says that one of
Hunt's great strengths is his rapport with the staff right down to the grass
roots. 'They have tremendous respect for his abilities and that counts for a
lot,' he says.
His worst moment, Hunt says, was when Randall rang him on his mobile phone
one day in May 1989 and said: 'I thought I had to tell you, Derek, we're not
going to make it.' The business had run out of cash, interest payments were
looming, and the team had to go back to its banks and shareholders for the
refinancing.
At the time, Hunt thought MFI might fail. 'During the refinancing there were
times when I believed it could happen. But looking back we were quite a long
way away,' he reflects.
A fair part of MFI's survival must be down to Hunt himself. He is a
determined man, 'my wife calls me stubborn', he says. According to Randall:
'We succeeded because Derek didn't know we were beat.'
MFI's strengths included a management team which has been together now for
13 years and had run the business even before it was bought by Asda. 'They
are very much on top of the business,' says Whitney, 'responding fast to
make adjustments.'
Sales were volatile, but there was always an underlying core to the business
which even in the worst year made a profit of Pounds 48.6m before the
interest payments on its debt.
The business has not simply been run for cash as many highly-leveraged
companies are. More than Pounds 250m has been invested in the business which
has acquired the Schreiber brand of bedroom furniture, expanded into France,
and developed and begun to roll out a new store format.
Hunt himself has been slimmed down though. He admits to losing three stones
in weight since the buy-out, a reduction of a sixth. An attempt to give up
smoking, though, has failed. Is it the pressure? 'No, I'm just a nicotine
addict,' he says, but he has promised to give up again after the float.
What about the future? 'When you've been where we've been you can deal with
anything in business terms,' he reckons. Meanwhile he is just going to enjoy
the flotation and look forward to a golfing holiday, probably in Florida.

FT  13 JUN 92 / Leading Article: Transatlantic morning after
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
JAM TOMORROW, but never jam today. The stock market reaction to a week of
dreary economic news has been instructive. The FT-SE Index has retreated 65
points, or about 2.4 per cent; but much of the fall came well ahead of the
main economic news. This suggests that the market was falling simply because
it was over-bought, as technicians had warned that it would. The bad news,
of flat retail sales, a continued housing slump and weak car exports, seems
to have come as no surprise.
The forecasting consensus in the City has virtually caught up with the
pessimism of its monetarist minority, who got it right all along. Whitehall
leaks suggest that the government is also getting used to the idea of a flat
1992. What remains to be seen is how business and consumer confidence will
stand up to disappointment. If the unchanging facts arouse new insecurity
about jobs, or find shops overstocked and production schedules
overambitious, the news itself could get worse before the trend stabilises.
For real recovery, wait a bit longer - possibly until 1993.
How did we get locked into this recurring cycle of hope deferred? The
clearest explanation has been offered not in London, but in Washington. The
US economy is now a full year into statistical recovery, but continues to
disappoint. The Fed chairman, Mr Alan Greenspan, has commented on this with
a candour which is itself a strong argument for an independent central bank.
He says, in effect, that we are off the map. This is the worst credit crisis
for 60 years, and the models which generate economic forecasts have no
experience to guide them.
Micawberish hope
Mr Greenspan has always warned of the downside risk - partly to justify the
enormous fall in short-term interest rates which the Fed has engineered.
Whitehall has been very reluctant to catch up with his thinking, and
persisted in a Micawberish hope that something will turn up - partly because
membership of the ERM forbids any dramatic easing of monetary policy in
response to disappointing reality. This obstacle has led some monetarists to
blame all our troubles on the ERM, but the parallel disappointments across
the Atlantic, and indeed in Japan, show that this cannot be the whole story.
While there are marked contrasts between the three economies, the
over-borrowing permitted during the late 1980s has led to a similar hangover
in all of them. Property and asset prices have fallen, reducing personal and
corporate wealth (most heavily in Japan); the banks have come under heavy
strain, which has forced them to cut their lending and raise their charges
(especially in the US); and personal and corporate spending has fallen as
borrowers try to reduce their debt burden (most markedly in the UK). It is
these confidence and wealth effects which have disrupted the forecasting
models.
Biggest obstacle
However, if the disease looks much the same, the cures in the three
countries are quite different. In Japan the biggest obstacle is the disgrace
which the financial markets have suffered; it is almost impossible to
finance new enterprises. In the US, which is at last beginning to face up to
its national debt crisis (urged on, to much applause, by Mr Ross Perot),
Washington has run out of prescriptions. The only promising stimulus must be
sought from net exports (which have supported more than half of total US
growth over the last five years); only this will raise employment and so
revive the home market. The Americans will therefore continue to badger
trade partners (especially Germany) for a stimulus, as they have often done
before.
British commentators may also be tempted to badger the Germans, but
ministers know better. The two countries share a central objective, to
defeat inflation, and no-one (least of all Mr John Major) has ever believed
that this would be easy or costless. With an election victory behind them,
ministers will be more than ever ready to soldier on. If this involves some
years of painfully slow growth, as it has in France, so be it - at any rate
until the next election looms.
This need not mean that there is nothing the British can do except grit
their teeth. In a fascinating speech in Rome the Bank of England's chief
economist, Dr Mervyn King, argued that there is no inherent reason why the
German rate of interest should be a floor for all other members of the ERM;
it is simply a question of market confidence in their exchange rate
commitment (in two words, street cred). He forecast that within the year
someone would follow the French in testing this proposition by cutting
domestic rates below those ruling in Frankfurt, and he can only have meant
the UK.
There are two difficulties with this strategy. It may be hard for ministers
to establish market credibility unless the trade figures improve markedly;
and even if a King experiment succeeded, any likely rate cut would be small.
There remain what Dr King calls 'alternative ways of dealing with shocks' -
tax adjustments and public investment. This is marginal stuff, again; it's
still jam tomorrow.

FT  13 JUN 92 / Euro Disney: The story so far - City measures success in
feet
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARY MEAD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CITY of London analysts believe that Euro Disney's success depends on its
ability to meet its target of 11m visitors in its first year of operation,
up to March 1993. But the signs are that it is already failing to do so.
Euro Disney recently released figures suggesting that so far an average
30,137 people a day visited in its first two months after opening on April
12. This would put it on course to achieve its 11m target.
But what threatens to savage the venture in the mid-term is a looming
failure to maintain the daily attendance figure into October and beyond.
While the venture may be achieving its daily 30,000 admission figure,
analysts view a daily 20,000 average for the period October 1992 to March
1993 as optimistic.
Even given a mini-boom of a daily average of 45,000 in the peak months of
July and August, some analysts estimate that it could be heading for a total
of 8.4m visitors.
According to Ms Anita Hibbert of securities house Smith New Court: 'Although
that daily average is meeting Euro Disney's 11m target, it does not allow
for sea-sonality.'
By having achieved only 30,000 per day so far - in good weather and with
frequent holidays in its main European markets - it is already facing
difficulties meeting its target, especially as winter draws closer. Euro
Disney has projected 14m visitors for its second year; that figure is
already looking over-optimistic, according to analysts.
Mr Nigel Reed, of Paribas Capital Markets Group, is another sceptic,
although he believes it premature to make conclusions. 'We are cautious
about the project. It's early days but the early signs have not been
encouraging. Paribas has been advising shareholders to sell.'
Mr Nicholas de Schonen, head of corporate communications at Euro Disney,
said yesterday: 'We need to go through one year to have a picture of the
situation. Our experience is too short to make any conclusions.'

FT  13 JUN 92 / Building workers agree 2.5% pay rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CONSTRUCTION unions yesterday agreed to accept a 2.5 per cent rise for basic
pay rates in negotiations covering 600,000 building and civil engineering
workers.
The deal followed a warning by Ucatt, the main union in the talks, of a
'summer of discontent' on building sites if employers refused to withdraw
their initial proposal for a pay freeze.
Some building sites in London have already seen unofficial action by workers
over past weeks. For example, a tower crane on a site in Gloucester Road,
west London, has been occupied by pickets since Tuesday, following the
alleged sackings of a group of shop stewards.
The deal, which will take basic pay for craft operatives to Pounds 4.09 an
hour and for labourers to Pounds 3.48, takes effect from June 29. These
negotiated basic rates bear little relation to actual wages paid but do
influence the scale of increases contractors are likely to pay.
Separately, a survey of professional staff in the construction industry,
conducted by Building magazine, indicates that more than half of
construction companies will impose a pay freeze this year.
Fifteen per cent of companies will give rises of 1 per cent to 4 per cent
but just over a quarter expect to raise salaries between 5 per cent and 8
per cent after earlier pay freezes.

FT  13 JUN 92 / Generator enters gas market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NATIONAL Power, the electricity generator, is one of 32 bidders which have
been allowed to buy gas from British Gas to sell on to the industrial and
commercial market.
The company said it had bought a 'very small amount' to 'gain marketing and
operational experience in the gas market'. It had customers lined up to buy
the gas.
Rival generator PowerGen already has a toe-hold in the gas market through
Kinetica, a joint venture with Conoco, the oil company. Several other
successful bidders are joint ventures between regional electricity companies
and gas suppliers.
British Gas agreed with the Office of Fair Trading earlier this year to sell
500m therms of gas in the first of a series of annual sales aimed at
reducing the company's share of the industrial market from 90 per cent to 40
per cent by 1995.
British Gas said yesterday that it could not release details of the
allocations, but it is thought that 23 suppliers each received 17.8m therms,
with nine others receiving the minimum allocation of 10m therms.
Some larger suppliers criticised the way the auction was operated, warning
that it could impede the development of competition. Mr John Astrop,
commercial director of Kinetica, which supplies 1,000 sites, was 'very
disappointed' with the allocation. He said: 'It is less than we hoped for,
and shows the problems with allocating the gas on a per capita basis without
taking account of who are the established, long-term players.'
He was worried that the auction may have encouraged smaller companies to buy
gas, although they would be unwilling or unable to secure longer-term
supplies. This could hinder the growth of longer-term players and slow the
development of real competition.
The Gas Consumers Council said it was surprised at the number of successful
applicants, and welcomed the widened choice for consumers.
Many observers said it was inevitable that an 'after market' would develop
in gas supplies, with trading between independent suppliers.

The Pounds 90,000 post is open to applicants from both inside and outside

Mr Richard Simmons, a senior partner of Arthur Anderson, the accountants and

Sir Norman said that while there were 'some excellent staff employed' there
was a need to bring all their efforts together. 'Our aim must be to build an
organisation for the 1990s which will be the most effective political
fighting force in the country,' he said.

FT  13 JUN 92 / 'Vandals' warning after rates decision
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER, Property Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE property industry warned yesterday that more office blocks would be
vandalised by owners trying to escape rate bills, following a refusal by the
Department of the Environment this week to cut the rates levied on empty
buildings.
Mr Michael Pattison, secretary-general of the Royal Institution of Chartered
Surveyors, said instances where the interiors of office blocks had been
stripped out to avoid business rates were 'the tip of a nasty iceberg'.
Rates levied on unlet property were 'leading to systematic, wanton
destruction', he said.
By making a vacant building 'incapable of beneficial occupation', property
owners eliminate a rates bill that would otherwise be 50 per cent of the
full liability.
The government has decided it would be too costly to reduce the rates for
empty properties. The half-rate charge, which was introduced with the
uniform business rate in 1990, brought in an estimated Pounds 450m last
year.
On Thursday Mr John Redwood, minister for local government, wrote to Mr
Howard Davies, director-general of the Confederation of British Industry,
pointing out that business rates had been cut by Pounds 1.25bn in the
Budget. 'Against this background the existing rules on empty rates should
remain,' he said.
Mr Pattison said the property industry would press for a reversal of that
decision. 'We are not likely to accept that this is the last word,' he said.
Property owners and tenants have been lobbying the government for several
months urging a reduction in rates on empty properties to 15 per cent, which
they consider a fair reflection of the costs of servicing an empty building.
They also want the grace period before rates are levied on an empty building
extended from three months to a year, in line with the longer periods now
needed to let a building.
Over the past year Wates City of London, a quoted property company, has
saved about Pounds 280,000 a year in tax by stripping the ceilings out of
40,000 sq ft of Winchester House in the City, a building it has earmarked
for redevelopment.
Mr Rod Clutton, development director, said the measures should not be
compared to vandalism. 'Vandalism suggests destruction for destruction's
sake. We are stripping things out to minimise our tax liability. This tax is
penal.'

FT  13 JUN 92 / Japanese business confidence at 5-year low
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVEN BUTLER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
HOPES FOR an early recovery of the Japanese economy were dashed yesterday
when the Bank of Japan reported that business confidence in May had plunged
to the lowest level in five years.
The results of the quarterly Tankan, or short-term economic survey, showed
an unexpectedly pessimistic outlook and contributed to a decline yesterday
on the Tokyo Stock Exchange. The Nikkei Average closed down 325.37 points at
17,383,68.
The closely-watched index of business conditions for manufacturing
industries plunged from minus 5 per cent in February to minus 24 per cent,
compared to a forecast in February of minus 12 per cent. Non-manufacturing
fell from 17 per cent in February to 1 per cent in May, compared to a
forecast of 5 per cent.
The Bank of Japan nonetheless said the economy had hit bottom and
manufacturers were expecting a modest improvement in the months ahead, with
the index rising to minus 20 per cent in September.
Manufacturing profits are expected to be down by 4.8 per cent in fiscal
1992, which began in April, after falling 23.4 per cent in 1991. Profits in
the first half of the year are projected to be off 22.5 per cent, although
the second half of the year will see a 17 per cent rise compared to the same
period of 1991.
The survey confirmed earlier statistics indicating that the overhang of
unsold goods which has depressed the manufacturing sector has not eased. The
index of product inventory levels rose from 31 per cent in February to 32
per cent in May, compared to earlier forecasts of a fall to 18 per cent.
The Bank of Japan said the survey would not cause it to ease monetary policy
further. The official discount rate, at which the central banks lends money
to commercial banks, was last reduced by 0.75 per cent to 3.75 per cent in
early April. Economists believe the central bank may be forced to reduce
interest rates again in the autumn.
The Tankan survey showed a continuing modest easing in the labour market
with the index moving from minus 15 per cent in February to minus 7 per cent
in May.
Investment by large companies is to decline by 2.1 per cent during the
fiscal year, with manufacturing investment declining by 8.9 per cent.
Investment by small companies is forecast to decline by 25.4 per cent,
although actual investment by small companies usually exceeds forecasts as
they are slower to finalise plans.
The survey showed a slight easing of financial conditions, while financial
institutions are taking a more accommodative stance toward lending.

WORKERS suffer from stress are to be offered instant information on where to
find Tai-Chi exercise sessions or even juggling classes to help them relax,
following the launch yesterday of a one-stop anti-stress service for
companies.
The service by Mind, the mental health charity, will tackle more serious
emotional problems with a 24-hour-a-day counselling service. Stress
management courses will also be provided by the charity. Mind expects more
than 1,000 organisations to join the Pounds 600-a-year programme.
Companies will get extra peace of mind from the fact that the covenanted fee
to Mind will count as a charitable donation and can therefore be offset
against tax.
Stress and other emotional difficulties are estimated to cost Pounds 7bn a
year in the UK - at least half of which is calculated to be a direct cost to
industry through reductions in productivity. A total of 80m annual working
days are lost, according to Department of Health figures.
Particularly stressful occupations were said by Mind to include farming, the
emergency services and teaching. The charity stressed that 'executive
stress' was not the only problem - production-line workers with little
control over their jobs could suffer.
Ms Judi Clements, Mind director, said that stress and more severe forms of
mental distress, affected one in four people each year.

FT  13 JUN 92 / Bundesbank warned on 'abuse' of borrowing powers

THE Bundesbank's chief economist yesterday warned the German government
against 'abuse' of its public borrowing powers.
Mr Otmar Issing said it already faced an interest repayments crunch in the
mid-1990s,and if it did not bring debt under control, future living
standards would suffer.
Tax increases or cuts in social services would become unavoidable, the
central bank official claimed.
Total public debt, currently around 45 per cent of gross national product
(GNP), would increase to at least 50 per cent by the end of 1996, he
predicted.
Other factors, such as the state railway's borrowings and those of the
former east German authorities, could add another 4 per cent to the total
burden.
Interest charges would then account for up to 17 per cent of the federal
budget, Mr Issing told a taxpayers' association meeting in Kiel.
Continuing a long-running Bundesbank campaign to squash popular notions that
the costs of unification should have no effect on west German pay packets
and living standards, he said there was no real alternative to borrowing to
support the east.
But increasing debt to maintain services in the west would lead the country
into a 'vicious circle'.
The government, committed to an effective spending freeze, had no more room
for financial manoeuvre, and there was no chance of squeezing out extra
funds from tax increases at present.
At 41 per cent of gross earnings, the overall burden of tax and social
security contributions was already at record levels.
Experience in the early 1980s had shown that attempts to raise funds by
increasing taxation would not work.
In an indirect attack on government plans to levy charges to pay for care of
the elderly, Mr Issing said: 'We must leave the old ways of social policy
and reconcile what is desirable with what is necessary.'
Social services spending, already under pressure in Bonn - where the health
minister recently proposed savings of up to DM11bn (Pounds 3.7bn) a year -
will come under increasing scrutiny in future.
At present, one-third of the population is over 60, the average pensionable
age. Within 20 years the proportion will rise to 50 per cent, he added.
State borrowing in order to fund public benefits and services gave the
impression that they were free.
'And here we find the often too-powerful temptation which leads democratic
systems to abuse public borrowing,' Mr Issing said.
Meanwhile, the Bundesbank remains concerned at the increase in private
credit.
Mr Helmut Schlesinger, president of the central bank, said in Bonn on
Thursday that recent money supply growth of 8 to 9 per cent had 'heavily
overstepped our targets' of a 5.5 per cent maximum.
There were some positive aspects, including borrowing to invest in industry,
but the trend undermined the effectiveness of the central bank's controls.
This year's average 5.5 per cent round of pay increases and inflation at
around 4.5 per cent were also discouraging, he said.
There was no scope for a reduction in key interest rates 'in the near
future', he added.

<TEXT>
THE Swiss government, bowing to pressure from a pacifist pressure group, is
set to postpone a controversial Dollars 2.45bn (Pounds 1.3bn) order of 34
McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet fighter aircraft until a national referendum
can be held on the issue next year.
The decision is a radical departure from the traditional process for
approving military purchases, and reflects an increasing paralysis in
Switzerland's much praised system of government.
It has been customary for military matters to be decided by the Defence
Department.
There has been growing public unease over the plan to buy the highly
sophisticated and expensive F/A-18s at a time when external threats seem to
have disappeared and the economy is in deep recession.
A pacifist movement launched a petition to force the government to hold a
referendum on the issue. To the surprise of many, the Group for an Army-Free
Switzerland (GSA) needed only 12 days to gather the 100,000 voters'
signatures needed.
Unnerved by the apparent scale of public opposition, the cabinet proposed
delaying the order and the lower house of the federal parliament agreed
yesterday by a narrow 103-84 margin after an unusually animated three-day
debate.
The question must now be referred back to the more conservative upper house,
which voted in early April to place the order immediately.

FT  13 JUN 92 / (CORRECTED) Finance and the Family (Briefcase): Death duty
again
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Correction (published 20th June 1992) appended to this article.
MY FATHER died in 1954 leaving an estate now valued at about Pounds 400,000
in a family trust for my sister and me to inherit on the death of our
mother. Our mother is still alive and is living as a life tenant from an
income of approximately Pounds 30,000 per year, although she only draws
Pounds 12,000 a year of this and the family trust pays her income tax.
Will my sister and I be liable to pay any inheritance tax when out mother
dies? Death duty was paid at the time of my father's death.
On the death of the life tenant (your mother) inheritance tax will be
payable on the value of the settled fund as if she had been the absolute
owner of the fund.
No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the
answers given in these columns. All inquiries will be answered by post as
soon as possible.
Correction (published 20th June 1992)
AN incorrect reply was given in the item last week headed 'Death duty
again'. It ignored paragraph 2 of schedule 6 to the Inheritance Tax Act
1984.
The correct position as stated in Chapter 7.17 of the Inland Revenue IHT 1
booklet is: 'Where estate duty was paid on the death of one spouse on
property in which the other was given a limited interest, for example, for
life or widowhood or widowerhood, the property was usually exempt from
estate duty on the death of the survivor. In such a case when the survivor
dies, or the interest comes to an end or is disposed of, there will be no
charge to IHT on the settled property if it would have been exempt from
estate duty on the survivor's death.'
IHT would not be payable on the death of the life tenant on the value of the
settled fund as described by our reader.
No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the
answers given in these columns. All inquiries will be answered by post as

FT  12 JUN 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Retail figures reinforce
Dow's negative mood

<TEXT>
Wall Street
THE reversal in US markets continued yesterday morning with share prices
giving up ground for a third day, before a late round of programme-buying
helped the market recover in the last hour of trading, writes Karen Zagor in
New York.
At the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average stood 8.29 higher at 3,351.51
in volume of less than 194m shares. Other market indices were mixed. The
Standard &amp; Poor's 500 firmed 1.80 to 409.05, the Amex composite was off 0.23
to 389.90 and the Nasdaq composite lost 2.03 at 567.68.
On Wednesday, the Dow fell 26.70 to 3,343.22 after dropping 34.21 on
Tuesday.
The market's recent negative sentiment was reinforced by the release of
retail sales for May, which painted a picture of continued economic
sluggishness. The sales report, following Tuesday's release of a sharp drop
in April consumer borrowing, added to investors' concerns about the pace of
economic recovery.
May's retail sales came in only 0.2 per cent higher with analysts expecting
an increase of about 0.7 per cent. Stripping out automobile sales in the
month, sales were unchanged.
In addition, the April retail sales figure was revised to show a 0.4 per
cent rise from a previously-reported 0.9 per cent increase.
Also contributing to the equity market weakness was a report that jobless
claims for the week ended May 30 were unchanged at 407,000 which gave
further evidence of a stagnant labour market.
Drug company stocks led big board trading through the day, with
Bristol-Myers Squibb firming Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 63, Glaxo Holding's
ADRs unchanged at Dollars 26 1/2 , Merck rising Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 49
1/4 and Abbott Laboratories holding steady at Dollars 27.
The transportation sector continued to bear the brunt of concerns that the
recent air fare wars would hurt airline company earnings, with the Dow Jones
Transportation Average dropping 3.17 to 1,331.84.
Among airline issues, AMR, parent of American Airlines, rose Dollars 1/8 to
Dollars 63, Delta Air Lines slipped Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 57 1/8 , USAir
was off Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 12 1/4 and United Airlines eased Dollars
1/8 to Dollars 115 3/4 .
Burlington Northern, one of the biggest US railroad companies, fell Dollars
2 1/4 to Dollars 39 after an analyst at First Boston downgraded the rating
on the stock from 'buy' to 'hold'.
Amdura, a manufacturer of industrial hardware, plummeted Dollars 5 to
Dollars 3 after a delayed opening. The company said that it was hiring an
investment banker to help with a possible debt restructuring. Amdura, which
expects to turn in a loss of Dollars 1.07m for the quarter to March 31, said
that a holder of 10.5 per cent of its common shares has recommended a
capitalisation plan to cut the company's debt.
Canada
TORONTO stocks closed slightly higher in moderate trading. Based on
preliminary data, the TSE 300 index rose 16.74 points, or 0.50 per cent, to
3,385.37, although declining issues led advances 266 to 254. Trading volume
of 22.9m shares was down from Wednesday's 24.9m, and trading value was
CDollars 255m against CDollars 359.7m.

FT  12 JUN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: UK tries to calm fears over EC
capital rules
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REUTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN HAS moved to calm commodity traders' fears that the planned European
Community capital adequacy rules could harm their profitability, reports
Reuter.
Treasury officials said that the government had asked the community for
discretion in the treatment of commodity brokerages with regard to the
planned regulations. 'We have every confidence we will be able to achieve
that,' one said.
European Commission officials announced on Wednesday that they had made a
significant breakthrough in agreeing capital adequacy rules for investment
companies to allow them to operate in the community's single market.
Some details have still to be settled, but a final political agreement on
the Capital Adequacy Directive is possible at a council meeting on June 29.
One of the spin-offs of the planned set of regulations is that it could
seriously damage London Metal Exchange brokers. The fact that most LME
members trade foreign exchange means they get caught by the directive's net.
Mr David King, the LME chief executive, said yesterday that he had discussed
the issue on Wednesday evening with the UK Treasury. He was accompanied by,
among others, Mr Phillip Thorpe, chief executive of the London Futures and
Options Exchange.
Mr King said the Treasury told him it was committed to seeking 'some
accommodation for commodity business within the directive' or ideally to
exclude it altogether. 'We have to weigh up every word, almost down to each
dot and comma,' he added.
One problem for LME members would be that a broker's net worth for
regulatory purposes would be reduced by 8 per cent of the value of stocks it
holds. At present LME warehouses hold nearly 2m tonnes of metal worth about
Dollars 3bn.
Mr King said there was also a potential difficulty on the question of large
credit exposures.
The International Commodity Clearing House would be deemed to be a
counterparty, so the large credits outstanding between members and the
clearing house could breach the exposure rule. The clearing house, owned by
British commercial banks, clears and guarantees business on London's futures
markets.

MEMBERS OF the Association of Natural Rubber Producing Countries members,
who are meeting here next week, appear willing to shelve ideas for a
producer cartel and explore the possibilities of an open market, a local
commodity exchange official said yesterday, reports Reuter from Singapore.
'A new mood seems to be prevailing, I think. There is a willingness among
producers to give the open market a chance, to explore ways to find a better
price through open trade,' said Mr Quek Kar Tung, general manager of
Singapore's RAS Commodity Exchange.
Rubber producers, frustrated by an extended period of low prices, have been
considering ways to boost prices. One idea recently mooted was a producers'
cartel to restrain supply.
The producers' association, formed in 1970, groups India, Indonesia,
Malaysia, Papua New Guinea, Sri Lanka, Thailand and Singapore, which account
for the bulk of the world's natural rubber output.

FT  12 JUN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: The power behind Pechiney's
Dunkirk smelter - An aluminium project that owes its conception to
overgeneration of electricity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT STARTED with a convivial lunch-time conversation between two of France's
most powerful industrialists. From that friendly chat was to spring one of
Europe's biggest industrial projects in recent times, the Dollars 1bn
Dunkirk aluminium smelter.
One of the industrialists at that lunch, Mr Pierre Delaporte, president of
Electricite de France, the state-owned power generation group, had a big
problem. EDF, like other energy suppliers which need to forecast demand many
years ahead, had miscalculated. It was going to have too much nuclear
generating capacity in the early 1990s.
EDF contacted some of its best customers, those with huge energy
requirements, to see if something could be worked out with them.
That is why Mr Delaporte sat down to lunch with Mr Jean Gandois, president
of Pechiney, France's state-owned aluminium group. A modern aluminium
smelter, producing about 250,000 tonnes a year, will consume as much
electricity as a city the size of Sheffield or Lyons.
Mr Gandois was already in an expansionist frame of mind. At the time of the
lunch with Mr Delaporte, the autumn of 1988, he was secretly putting the
final touches to a deal for Pechiney to buy American National Can, the
world's biggest packaging company, for Dollars 4bn.
His response to Mr Delaporte's overtures was equally audacious. 'Let's build
a new aluminium smelter in France,' he suggested.
Some would have dismissed this as a foolish proposition because all through
the 1980s aluminium production had been steadily drifting from countries
where energy costs were high to those with abundant, low-cost supplies -
particularly countries with hydro-electric power. In that process nearly all
of Japan's aluminium smelters closed down while new ones were built in
Canada, South America and the Middle East.
However, some European industrialists are worried about this growing
separation of aluminium production and the main consuming markets. They
suggest it makes the European industry more vulnerable to exchange rate
fluctuations (aluminium prices are usually quoted in US dollars) and say
nobody can guarantee that the governments of the energy-rich countries will
not develop Opec-type pricing policies for their aluminium sometime in the
future.
So Mr Gandois could not resist grabbing EDF's offer.
There was a snag though. That low-cost power was available only for a few
specific years at the beginning of the 1990s and Pechiney would have to act
very quickly to take advantage of EDF's offer.
Pechiney and EDF did some fast research and chose Dunkirk, near the coast
across the Channel from Britain, for the site of the smelter. It is an area
of high unemployment (more than 16 per cent) and close to an EDF nuclear
power station.
The proposed smelter was to cost about Dollars 750m and working capital
requirements would take the total cash needed to about Dollars 1bn.
Pechiney's balance sheet was also about to be burdened with the cost of
American National Can so a complex financing arrangement for the smelter was
worked out.
Consequently, Pechiney controls 35 per cent of Aluminium Dunkirk, the
company which owns the Dunkirk smelter. French and foreign banks and
insurance companies hold the rest. Pechiney also has a one-third share in
the company that operates the smelter with the rest of the equity shared by
the ownership company and EDF.
Pechiney is responsible for supplying all the smelter's alumina (aluminium
oxide) - 400,000 tonnes a year of this essential raw material - and for
selling the aluminium.
When Mr Gandois told his technical people that Pechiney was to build a new
smelter they said: 'Give us another 18 months or two years and we will have
some fantastic new technology for you.' But he told them it was not possible
to wait. The start-up of the smelter had to synchronise with EDF's period of
excessive capacity.
And, probably because every bit of technology employed at Dunkirk has been
tried and tested elsewhere before on a commercial scale, the smelter was
built and brought into operation in only 22 months, probably a record for a
smelter on a greenfield site.
That is not to say that Dunkirk's technology is old-fashioned. Apart from
being Europe's biggest aluminium producer and third in the world outside the
former Soviet Union, Pechiney claims leadership in sales of aluminium
technology - two out of three new smelters built in the past 10 years have
employed some of its technology.
In aluminium smelting, the aim is to push as much electricity through the
raw material as possible - the higher the amperage, the more metal can be
produced. But this is a tricky business. The magnetic fields created by all
this power can play havoc and create very dangerous conditions in the
smelter if not properly controlled.
Pechiney won many technical contracts because it was the first company to
operate a pot line functioning at more than 280,000 amperes. At Dunkirk
Pechiney has brought into operation the first complete set of electrolytic
reduction cells (called pots in the trade) running on a direct current of
300,000 amperes.
This technology makes the smelter the most productive anywhere in the world,
Pechiney claims, with an output of 400 tonnes a year for each one of the 550
members of the workforce.
This is made possible by the design of the pot conductor circuits, which are
able to optimise the magnetic fields in the 'pad' of metal and thereby
ensure its stability.
Also, Dunkirk's 264 pots are in one long line rather than split into two or
three lines as seen in other modern smelters. This not only keeps down
capital costs but needs fewer people to operate the pots.
Pechiney claims, too, that Dunkirk emits virtually no pollution.
When Pechiney and EDF announced the smelter in November 1988, there was
widespread suspicion it was possible only because EDF would be supplying
electricity subsidised in some way by the French taxpayer. Some critics
suggested the European Commission might veto the scheme.
The commission's investigation certainly took some time but the partners
pressed on with construction. They had spent Dollars 500m and still the
commission was withholding its necessary blessing. Even though Mr Jacques
Delors, the French president of the commission, was supportive, Pechiney and
EDF only gained the necessary EC approval from Sir Leon Brittan, the
Competition Commissioner, by undertaking that the proposed price of
electricity to the smelter would be increased by 10 per cent in the three
years from 1997. The commission said pricing before that three-year period
was fair.
The smelter's first pot started up in November, only 22 months after work
started. On May 15 this year the smelter was running at its nominal full
annual capacity rate: 215,000 tonnes. Mr Bernard Allais, the pot line
manager, says it will be stabilised at this level for some months for some
'fine tuning'.
Nevertheless, Dunkirk will produce 180,000 tonnes of aluminium this year and
is breaking even at the operating level.
Pechiney has closed two small smelters, at Riouperoux in the French Alps and
Noguere in south western France, which between them produced about 80,000
tonnes. So Dunkirk represents an addition of about 135,000 tonnes to its
annual capacity. Its total output this year is predicted to be 870,000
tonnes.
Mr Gandois, pleased with the success of his venture, says the Dunkirk
smelter proves there is still a place for big, heavy industrial projects in
Europe.
Others are not so sure. Mr David Morton, chairman of Pechiney's rival, Alcan
of Canada, almost certainly has Dunkirk in mind when he says: 'One must
question whether a crowded region like Europe should use so much of its
energy resources to create the relatively few jobs available in an aluminium
smelter.'

FT  12 JUN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Rain threatens US wheat crop
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ALTHOUGH SHOWERS in the Midwest are easing fears of another US drought, too
much rain in Texas and Oklahoma has contributed to concern about the winter
wheat harvest at a time when US wheat stocks are already at their lowest
level for years.
Even without the weather considerations, the US Department of Agriculture
yesterday projected tightened wheat supplies for 1992-93 as a result of
reductions in expected yields and planted acreage. Stocks at the end of
1992-93 were projected at 427m bushels, down 22m from last month's
estimates.
Harvesting in two of the three largest winter wheat-producing states has
been delayed by the excessive rain, and the cotton crop in Texas may also be
damaged. The US Farm Bureau is estimating the total wheat crop at between
2.15bn and 2.2bn bushels, up from last year's unimpressive 1.98bn bushels.
There is no fear at all of tight wheat stocks worldwide. Smaller crops
predicted for the US, Morocco and South Africa are more than offset by a
larger projected output in the European Community and China. Canada's
surplus stocks from last year have turned out to be higher than had been
calculated.
Dr Norton Strommen, the USDA meteorologist, yesterday said recent rains in
Kansas have been sufficient for the maturing wheat. In Illinois, development
of maize and soyabeans has been slowed by dry weather. This week's showers
have been insufficient, but more rain was expected in the next 36 hours.
Worldwide, cotton production is expected to exceed use by 5m bales,
resulting in a further gain in stocks. With several countries aiming to
maintain production despite lower world prices, output is forecast at 94m
bales, only 1 per cent below last year's record.
The global oilseed crop is running about 3 per cent higher than last year.
Paraguay's soyabeans have been hurt by dry weather and US soyabean
production is projected at 52.1m tonnes, down from an estimated 54.4m last
year.

FT  12 JUN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Comex developing jet fuel
futures contract
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE NEW York Commodity Exchange (Comex) is developing a jet fuel futures
contract, which it hopes to submit for approval by the Commodity Futures
Trading Commission before the end of the year.
The move will not improve Comex's already antagonistic relations with the
New York Mercantile Exchange (Nymex), which is considered the primary energy
market. Nymex's heating oil futures are currently used by airlines to hedge
their jet fuel price risks. But, according to Comex, jet fuel users have
increasingly looked for a product that more closely corresponds to their
needs. It believes that there is sufficient demand for a jet fuel contract.
Nymex, which has in the past investigated the possibility of launching its
own jet fuel futures, decided against doing so because it deemed that the
number of players was too small. Its spokeswoman, Ms Nachamah Jacobovits,
said that while heating oil was not a perfect hedge, many airlines used it
and 'are happy with the level of liquidity'.
Comex, a metal exchange trading copper, silver and gold, has been keen to
broaden its product range. Its new chairman, Ms Donna Redel, has been
contemplating a renewed effort at trading aluminium as well as financial
futures based on the Eurotop 100 stock index, to be developed in
co-operation with the European Options Exchange in Amsterdam.
In spite of the existence of sour crude contract on Nymex, Comex moved ahead
to win Commodity Futures Trading Commission approval for a Dubai sour crude
future in April and plans to launch it in co-ordination with the
International Petroleum Exchange whenever the market ripens.
Comex also said in April that it intended to list futures on platinum and
palladium, both of which are traded on Nymex. Nymex retaliated by suggesting
it would consider contracts on silver and gold.
The jet fuel contract, thus seems to be only the latest in a series of Comex
challenges to Nymex. The two exchanges have had sporadic merger talks in
recent years, but these have always foundered. Nymex, which shares quarters
with Comex and three other New York exchanges, even withdrew last year from
a joint move to a new trading floor.

FT  12 JUN 92 / Government Bonds: Dealers switch into Dutch, German paper

THE D-Mark currency bloc saw firm buying interest yesterday as dealers and
investors continued to switch out of the high-yielding European bond markets
into German and Dutch government paper.
The German market kicked off on a weak note, after Mr Hans Tietmeyer, the
deputy president of the Bundesbank, was reported as saying that monetary
growth was still too high, and ruled out a relaxation of monetary policy.
But bund prices were pulled up later by the US Treasury bond market which
opened on a firm note. The Liffe bund futures contract opened at 88.29,
reached a low of 88.17 and ended the day at around 88.37.
Traders reported some switching out of medium-dated bund issues into the
longer-dated maturities with the result that long-dated bunds out-performed
the other maturities.
News that Mr Theo Waigel, the German finance minister, had said Germany
would not permit the convergence criteria for the European Monetary Union
(EMU) agreed in Maastricht to be diluted, also helped the D-Mark sector,
traders said.
Dutch government bonds ended firmer, following strong buying interest
particularly for the longer-dated issues. The government's latest 8.25 per
cent bond due June 2002 closed up 12 cents at 99.87, while the yield fell to
8.27 per cent from 8.29 per cent.
DOMESTIC buying on weakness helped to lift UK government bond prices
yesterday with the Liffe futures contract trading up from its opening level
of 97.28 to end at around 97.31. Volumes in the futures market were
above-average at 30,000 contracts.
The benchmark 11 3/4 per cent gilt due 2003/07 rose from 116 1/32 to end at
116 1/4 , but supply concerns continued to depress longer-dated issues
before the Bank of England's next auction.
US Treasuries rose yesterday in thin trading with the market receiving some
support from signs of a slow economic recovery. In late trading, the
Treasury's bellwether 30-year bond was  7/32 higher at 101 11/32 , yielding
7.878 per cent, while the two-year note was  3/32 higher, yielding 5.057 per
cent.
The Federal Reserve refrained from any open mar ket intervention, with Fed
funds trading at 3 13/16 per cent. Fed Funds changed hands at 3 3/4 per cent
in late trading.
Turnover picked up briefly on signs of continued economic sluggishness
following slower than expected May retail sales.
The Commerce Department reported a rise of 0.2 per cent in the month, below
the 0.7 per cent analysts had looked for.
The market also took strength from signs of an inert labour market from the
jobless claims numbers for the week ended May 30, which were unchanged at
407,000. Analysts had expected a decline of about 7,000 to reflect the
Memorial Day holiday in the week.
JAPANESE government bonds traded up during the day, though dealers said
there were few fresh factors to move the market ahead of the Bank of Japan's
quarterly Tankan report.
The Tankan, which will be released today, is expected to show that the
Japanese economy is slowing.
The benchmark No 129 opened with a yield of 5.51 per cent and closed at
5.475 per cent, corresponding to the highest level of the day, while the
futures contract rose from 101.82 to 101.90.
Short-term interest rates slipped, with the rate on three-month certificates
of deposit falling from 4.67 per cent to 4.65 per cent, their lowest level
in over three years.

FT  12 JUN 92 / International Capital Markets: Brokers' secret weapon is a
wrap - The appeal in the US of these accounts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN Wall Street's drive to discover new ways to make money from retail
stockbroking, the wrap account has become an important weapon.
Yet this hottest new product in the money management business has itself
recently come under fire with critics arguing that the wrap account gives
investors little in return for their money.
The concept is not particularly new - early versions date back a decade or
more - but it is only in the past year or so that the product has really
taken off with individual investors.
Normally, broking houses charge customers for a variety of separate services
like investment advice, order execution, custody and clearing - charges that
fluctuate depending on how often the customer trades in the market.
With a wrap account, the broker hands over the responsibility of managing
the customer's assets to an approved professional money manager, and in
return the customer pays the broker a flat fee (based on a percentage of the
assets under management) for finding the money manager and servicing the
account.
For the investor, the wrap account has a two-pronged appeal. First, it puts
a cap on broking costs. Investors prefer paying a flat fee because it
prevents stockbroking firms from promoting high-commission products or
indulging in 'churning' - the unnecessary trading of stocks in a customer
account just to boost revenues.
The second selling point is that investors with Dollars 50,000 to Dollars
100,000 in their brokerage accounts can get access to professional money
managers who normally handle individual's accounts valued in their millions.
In a country where the best investment managers are treated like superstars,
this is a strong draw for private investors.
To the money manager, wrap accounts not only bring in extra business, but it
is business that requires no marketing or servicing effort. All the manager
has to do is make the investment decisions.
Stockbrokers, meanwhile, love wrap accounts. They are an especially
lucrative product. The standard fee is usually between 2 per cent and 3 per
cent of the assets held in the account. In comparison, investors pay 1 per
cent or less for investment funds, and brokers' commission charges for
trading stocks in an averagely busy account are even less.
The wrap account also attracts the type of investor brokers love - the
conservative client who is more likely to stay with the broking firm, who is
likely to be less active in trading the market (thus keeping brokers'
execution costs down), and who may end up allowing the broker to handle all
of his financial assets.
This is the great prize brokers hope the wrap account will help them win. As
the US savings rate rises, Wall Street is competing hard with banks and
insurance companies to attract the billions of new investment dollars.
Yet stockbrokers are not the only financial companies to discover the allure
of wrap accounts. Banks like Chase Manhattan, insurers like Equitable and
giant fund groups like Fidelity are also now offering versions of the wrap
account to customers.
It is difficult to get hold of statistics to show how fast they have grown,
although industry experts estimate that about Dollars 30bn is currently held
in wrap accounts. Shearson Lehman is the leader in the field, and has 60,000
clients in wrap accounts with total assets of Dollars 13bn. Moreover, they
are currently selling like hot cakes. A few weeks ago an executive at the
firm said that Shearson was selling wrap accounts at the rate of Dollars
7,000m a month.
Despite its popularity with investors, the wrap account has its critics in
the investment community.
The common complaint is that the 3 per cent annual fee is far too high, and
that investors get little in return for their money that they cannot get
cheaper elsewhere.
Brokers say investors get access to the investment expertise of top-level
money managers. Yet money in a big US investment fund is in the hands of
equally experienced professionals, and the average expense ratio on mutual
funds is 1 per cent of total assets.
Contrary to what some investors may think, their wrap account does not
entitle them to particular individual attention from the money manager.
Mr John Gepfert, an investment consultant with the Randolph Group in
Connecticut, believes the small fee that the money manager receives (usually
around 0.5 per cent of the assets), makes it improbable that he or she will
devote a great deal of time to the account. 'You can't be available to a
Dollars 100,000 client who is paying you only 50 basis points a year,' says
Mr Gepfert.
There are also concerns about disclosure (how much do investors know about
who is managing their money, where it is being invested, and how the fee is
split between broker and manager?), about potential conflicts of interest
between broker and manager, and about the quality of managers recommended by
brokers.
There are 17,000 registered investment advisers in the US, and any one of
them could manage a wrap account. In their defence, brokers say they only
choose the best to put before customers.
Industry concern about wrap accounts has been sufficient to attract the
attention of the Securities and Exchange Commission. At the behest of the
investment community, the SEC has been looking into wrap accounts for about
a year. Although it has no current plans to take any action, industry
insiders believe the least the SEC will want to do is improve the level of
disclosure to wrap account holders.

FT  12 JUN 92 / International Company News: UPI finds a new buyer
</HEADLINE>

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
UNITED Press International, the financially troubled news agency, said last
night it had found a new buyer to replace Mr Pat Robertson, the television
evangelist who cancelled plans to acquire UPI on Wednesday.
Mr Steve Geimann, the executive editor of UPI, said the agency would
therefore not have to shut down - as threatened - at midnight tonight. . UPI
named Mr Leon Charney, an attorney and former President Carter adviser, as
the potential buyer.
Mr Robertson, who runs the Christian Broadcasting Network, withdrew his
Dollars 6m bid for UPI because he claimed he would have had to spend Dollars
31m over the next 18 months to make the news agency viable.
Although the prospect of a television preacher acquiring a news agency might
have seemed odd, UPI had no other bidders before Mr Robertson.
UPI last year filed for protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of US
bankruptcy law.

FT  12 JUN 92 / International Company News: Trizec in CDollars 300m share
issue
</HEADLINE>

   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TRIZEC, North America's biggest publicly traded real estate developer, is
raising between CDollars 200m (USDollars 166.6m) and CDollars 300m of new
equity through a private placement of common shares.
The issue will be a considerable achievement at a time when investors are
extremely wary of providing either debt or equity to property companies.
Trizec, which is based in Calgary, did not disclose which institutions were
buying the shares, but acknowledged that CDollars 50m will be taken up by
its parent, Carena.
Both companies are controlled by Toronto's Bronfman family.
Olympia &amp; York Developments, which is now under court protection in Canada
and the UK, has a 35 per cent stake in Trizec.
Mr Kevin Benson, president, said the share issue was considerably larger
than originally contemplated, but was raised to meet two large orders.
The shares are being sold at CDollars 4.50 each, about a third of where they
stood a year ago. Trizec shares lost 15 cents on the Toronto Stock Exchange
yesterday to CDollars 4.70. The private placement is expected to close on
June 19.
The company will use some of the funds to reduce its CDollars 9bn debt load.
Trizec has been called on several times in the past year to support its
ailing subsidiary, Bramalea, which has debts of CDollars 4.8bn.

FT  12 JUN 92 / International Company News: Salomon Bros strengthens US
equity operations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SALOMON Brothers, the New York investment bank recovering from last year's
Treasury bond auction scandal, yesterday moved to strengthen its battered US
equity operation with the appointment of Mr Rodney Berens as co-head of the
department.
Mr Berens, 47, formerly in charge of global research at Morgan Stanley, will
share responsibility for the department with its existing head, Mr Bruce
Hackett, and like him will join the executive committee which runs the
securities firm.
Mr Berens left Morgan Stanley last year for private business.
Salomon's equity department suffered a substantial number of resignations
late last year and early this as the group implemented a wide-ranging
shake-up of its management practices in the wake of the scandal.
This led to a widespread belief on Wall Street - strongly denied by Salomon
 -that the firm was scaling back its commitment to equities.

<TEXT>
THE ARIZONA Biltmore, a Phoenix hotel popular with US celebrities, has been
bought by a property partnership which includes Japan's Aoki Corporation,
for an undisclosed price.
The sale, by Equitable Life Assurance, is the latest example of Japanese
investors acquiring landmarks of American culture.
The Biltmore, one of the oldest resort hotels in the US, is also one of the
most attractive, with architecture inspired by Frank Lloyd Wright.
Aoki owns Westin Hotels &amp; Resorts and was already the management company for
the Biltmore. Its partner in the deal, Grossman Co Properties, is a US
property developer with offices in Arizona and California.
North America's major league baseball teams yesterday gave the final
go-ahead for a Japanese-led consortium of Seattle businessmen to buy the
local baseball team, the Mariners.
It will be the first major league baseball team to have no North American
owners.
